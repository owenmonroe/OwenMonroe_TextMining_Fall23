objects which this Society has in view and methods of operation 
 are detailed in the Constitution which accompanies this. It may, 
 however, be well to note that our aim summarised, is two-fold: namely, 
 
 (1) to provide books of a comparatively high order for the more 
 
 intelligent classes in China; and (2), books illustrated by chromos for 
 the families. We wish in no way to interfere with the action of any 
 Bible Societies or \ ract Societies, or the School and Text Book Series 
 Committee, or any private enterprise already existing; we seek to follow 
 out a line of work which is distinct, and which has hitherto not been 
 attempted on any scale proportionate to its importance. 
 
 ^ criptures and Tracts have their place and their unalienable 
 
 importance; and ever will. School and Text Books are also 
 indispensable for Seminaries and Colleges; but they are of their 
 nature technical, and adapted to be explained by a teacher. Purely 
 scientific books, again, are necessarily full of new terms and formulae, 
 and so beyond the ability of ordinary readers. Our object, therefore, 
 is to reach the general public, both literary and commercial, and while 
 we give them true science, endeavour at the same time to set it forth in 
 an attractive manner fitted to their present capacity for understanding 
 it. And our reasons for this new effort are:— 
 
 ^ uch objects are in keeping with the genius of the people. The 
 
 great distinguishing feature of the Chinese from the very earliest 
 times has been their attachment to literature, and the honour they 
 have set upon it. Their hero has been not the warrior, nor even the 
 statesman, but the scholar. This national sentiment has been fruitful 
 of many beneficent results. Amongst others it has led them, during 
 all their eras, to pay very great attention to education; and this, in 
 its turn, has produced a large proportion of readers, a high regard for 
 books, one uniform written language, and a system of competitive 
 examinations which until recent years was unparalleled in any part 
 of the world.

 CVhese features have struck every observer who has landed on their 
 shores, and led all who sought to influence the empire, to seek to 
 avail themselves of the press. But the question has always been in 
 regard to suitable books. The difficulties of the language, the peculiarities 
 of Chinese modes of thought and expression, and their tremendous 
 literature, which required to be mastered less or more before efficient 
 books could be produced, called a halt. 
 
 CV/N the opening days of modern intercourse missionaries felt it to be 
 their first duty to give them the Scriptures in their own tongue, 
 and epitomes of Divine Truth in different forms. But it has been 
 increasingly felt by all, of late years, that something more was needed. 
 Accordingly, not a few have been led to compose works on Geography, 
 History, Astronomy, and the various branches of science, and also to 
 attempt periodical literature in its different branches. 
 
 t*> mall editions of these works have been issued and they have been 
 prized in proportion as they became known. This has encouraged 
 us to proceed in that direction; but larger funds are needed to spread 
 such books even to a moderate extent in this wide empire. And this 
 is well worth the effort of all interested in China: for it is absolutely 
 clear that we can never open up the country satisfactorily until we 
 open the minds of the people. 
 
 S he opposition which is offered to Western views, plans, and efforts 
 of all kinds mercantile, political, and religious, is almost entirely 
 due to ignorance. And this is true both as regards local officials, the 
 gentry or literati, the censorate, and even of some of the high officials 
 in Peking. It is therefore of the very highest importance that this 
 ignorance be dispelled, and knowledge diffused through all classes of 
 the people. 
 
 .vvj oeeovee we have found that in cases where high officials at 
 ( 3 ^ Peking and enlightened Mandarins were prepared to accede to 
 foreign proposals, the local literati interfered, and effectually blocked 
 all proceedings. But these literati abound in every part of the empire, 
 and are held in the highest esteem; in fact are the very soul of the 
 empire and virtually rule it. It is therefore manifest that if we would 
 influence China at all as a nation, we must begin with them; and also 
 that it is only in proportion as we command their respect that affairs will 
 move smoothly in China, especially in the higher and larger departments.
