 IReport 
 
 <k^ 
 
 
 (||lRST Reports are not always what we could wish them to be. They 
 ^ often have to speak of difficulties which could not have been 
 foreseen, as well as successes achieved. And this is our position. 
 
 Owing to the change in the Constitution of the Parent Society, 
 and the consequent changes necessary here, time was expended, and so 
 we have virtually lost a year’s home Subscriptions. Now, however, the 
 Home Society have expressed their entire satisfaction with the basis 
 on which we stand, and the methods of operation on which we have 
 determined, and have resumed work on our behalf. And in their 
 Annual Report for 1887, a copy of which has been placed in the 
 hands of all our Directors, they express their resolution of supporting 
 us as they originally intended. 
 
 While we did not receive what we expected from the Parent 
 Society, the Ladies’ Auxiliaries never slackened their efforts. The 
 West of Scotland Ladies’ Auxiliary have sent us large supplies of 
 material as blank Scripture Histories, blank Calendars, Cards, Serials, 
 Pictures, etc., etc., which have been issued as books and serials and 
 otherwise as appears in the Depositary’s Report. The working up of 
 this material and the value of the time which our Superintendent 
 devotes to the interests of the West of Scotland Ladies’ Auxiliary 
 is fully compensated for by the sale of their publications, the whole 
 proceeds of which now go to the credit of this Society. The 
 Edinburgh Ladies’ Society also has remitted the sum of £260 
 with an order to publish a handsome illustrated edition of the “ Peep 
 of Day”—the proceeds of sale of which will all come to us, except 
 such as shall be distributed in the course of Christian work among 
 the families, according to the desire of the Ladies at home. We wish 
 


## p. (#6) ##################################################

0 
 
 to record our high appreciation of the value of such aid and our 
 assurance that we shall always do our best to promote the objects the 
 Ladies have in view. 
 
 Many friends in China have also subscribed liberally; and others 
 in Singapore and Penang—through the kind efforts of our Treasurer- 
 have sent us important donations, for which we desire to convey, to 
 them and to all, our meed of most hearty thanks. 
 
 Worft Done ♦—Thus though disappointed somewhat in our 
 receipts from home we have been able to do not a little work. We have 
 already issued 27 parts of Rev. E. Faber's work on “ Civilization," 
 in all 27,000; published Bacon's Novum Organum , translated and 
 adapted by the Rev. Win. Muirhead; reprinted new editions of the 
 Scripture Histories; and have continued the publication of the 
 illustrated serial for the households, as well as a variety of calendars, 
 cards, etc. 
 
 We have also in the press, both in Wunli and Mandarin, the 
 Christian Girl’s Classic and the Life of our Lord in verse for families. 
 
 Mainly owing to the absence of Dr. Y. J. Allen in America we 
 have not yet commenced our chief periodical; but have been preparing 
 articles and otherwise providing for its issue. Now that he has 
 returned we have resolved to commence it at once, and hope to have 
 the first number out after the Chinese New Year. We have also 
 made arrangements, to start the Bog’s Own in its full form, carefully 
 illustrated, which, with the chromo-illustrated serial for the households 
 will complete our set of magazines. 
 
 IReftlUlierattoe XKHOUfL—Supplementary to our own proper 
 work we have been able to do work which yields a certain revenue. 
 We have been continuously occupied with the printing of the Old 
 and New Testaments for the British and Foreign Bible Society and 
 American Bible Society; and also been employed by friends in many 
 parts of China to publish books of their own and their reports of work 
 done in Hospitals and other ways, and so a goodly number of such 
 books has passed through our hands. 
 
 We have also been engaged as the publishers of the Messenger , a 
 newspaper which is growing in influence and circulation. 
 
 In order to perform the work just indicated we have had to buy 
 more type; and as each new book, as a rule, contains fresh characters, 
 this expense must continue. We have also found it necessary to buy 
 two additional presses from home which are giving great satisfaction.

 Gratuitous Work ♦—This department lias not been neglected 
 by us, and although we wish we could have done more yet we have 
 carried through several things. We have distributed 2000 vols., 
 illustrated, on Natural Theology , at the Triennial examinations held 
 in Sept., viz: 500 at Peking, 500 at Nanking, 500 at Moukden the 
 capital of Manchuria; 250 at Hangchow, capital of Cheh-kiang, and 250 
 at Tsi-nan foo, the capital of Shantung. We also made a grant of 
 10,000 portions of Rev. E. Faber’s Civilization , by request, to the 
 Missionaries at Nanking, which were likewise distributed to the 
 students; and we have in harmony with the instructions from the West 
 of Scotland Ladies’ Auxiliary given Scripture Histories, Cliromo 
 Calendars, and illustrated Gospels, cards, &c., to Missionaries and others 
 who agreed to present them to influential families in the interior. 
 
 HQCnClCS* —The Indian Christian Vernacular Society have 
 appointed us their agents for China; and supplied us with an 
 assortment of their publications which will increase our influence and 
 usefulness in various ways. We also keep for sale works of the 
 Religious Tract Society of London, Messrs. T. Nelson and Sons, 
 Edinburgh, and the School and Text Book Series Committee. 
 
 We are happy to say that we are making headway; and feel we 
 have a large amount of sympathy in China, as might be shown by 
 extracts from numerous letters were it necessary. 
 
 jfun&s .— Our Balance sheet shews an increased surplus at credit 
 of the Society after making some provision for depreciation of our 
 Plant, and consequent on the liberality of our friends the contributions 
 to Special Fund raised at close of last year have enabled us to reduce 
 the debt to $1800, a sum which we hope to wipe off so soon as the 
 promised aid from the Parent Society comes to hand. This favourable 
 result during the past year has been attained through our having 
 had ample work under contracts from the Bible Societies and of 
 such work we have still on hand sufficient to make us hopeful of a 
 similar result during year ending 31st October, 1889. Our financial 
 prospects thereafter, when it is to be expected that our Presses will 
 be more entirely devoted to the preparation of our own publications, 
 will depend greatly on the support we get from friends in China in 
 shape of money and assistance in spreading our periodicals. We 
 therefore earnestly invite continued subscriptions from friends out 
 here, and we hope the anticipations of the speakers at the Annual 
 


## p. (#8) ##################################################

 Meeting of the Parent Society as to raising a yearly sum of £600 to 
 help us may also be fully realized. 
 
 Ube jfuture ♦—Now that the preliminaries have all been 
 settled, and our preparations almost completed, we hope fully to carry 
 out the programme which we presented to the Directors when we 
 commenced operations. As already intimated we intend to do our 
 best to start and carry on the periodical for the more intelligent 
 classes in China with care and vigour. We find the need for such 
 a periodical is becoming more and more imperative every day. We 
 know from private sources as well as the public press that the Chinese 
 are becoming increasingly conscious of their power; and we shall 
 soon have to face a new China, whose intellect expanded and sharpened 
 by Western education, whose sense of importance heightened by a 
 knowledge of their vast and varied resources, and whose combative 
 propensities strengthened by the successes they have won and are 
 winning in competition with our countrymen—shall test all our 
 powers to the utmost. 
 
 They have already taken up the pen, and also the pencil against 
 us: for their phillipics are often profusely illustrated and not inaptly. 
 They are certain to use these weapons more and more. They are 
 keen observers, trenchant writers, and skilled and clever at lampooning. 
 They know well all the springs of popular passion and how to rouse 
 and direct the feeling of the people against us. We must meet them. 
 Our security and our advancement in China depend upon our setting 
 ourselves right with the people. We therefore emphatically need an 
 organ to expound our Civilization and our Faith and defend them. 
 
 Wider considerations also point to the same conclusion. We are 
 face to face with the greatest non-christian nation in the World, rising 
 rapidly into full consciousness of itself, and its rights, and its powers, 
 as yet uninstructed and undeveloped, liable to all the outbursts of 
 unreasoning action which partial knowledge engenders. Foreign 
 interests are also growing in China year by year, though as yet we 
 have hardly broken the shell; and so the field for enterprise of every 
 description is almost boundless. Further there are certain problems 
 before us of a delicate and difficult character,—municipal, social, 
 commercial, political, and religious—which require thoughtful and 
 careful treatment. Satisfactory progress and the solution of these 
 


## p. (#9) ##################################################

9 
 
 problems depend entirely on harmony between the Chinese and 
 ourselves, and this can only be promoted, by the diffusion of sound 
 knowledge of ourselves and our aims. We therefore respectfully 
 submit that the work of this and kindred societies lies at the very root 
 of our own continued success: and the highest good of China.

## p. (#20) #################################################

objects which this Society has in view and methods of operation 
 are detailed in the Constitution which accompanies this. It may, 
 however, be well to note that our aim summarised, is two-fold: namely, 
 
 (1) to provide books of a comparatively high order for the more 
 
 intelligent classes in China; and (2), books illustrated by chromos for 
 the families. We wish in no way to interfere with the action of any 
 Bible Societies or \ ract Societies, or the School and Text Book Series 
 Committee, or any private enterprise already existing; we seek to follow 
 out a line of work which is distinct, and which has hitherto not been 
 attempted on any scale proportionate to its importance. 
 
 ^ criptures and Tracts have their place and their unalienable 
 
 importance; and ever will. School and Text Books are also 
 indispensable for Seminaries and Colleges; but they are of their 
 nature technical, and adapted to be explained by a teacher. Purely 
 scientific books, again, are necessarily full of new terms and formulae, 
 and so beyond the ability of ordinary readers. Our object, therefore, 
 is to reach the general public, both literary and commercial, and while 
 we give them true science, endeavour at the same time to set it forth in 
 an attractive manner fitted to their present capacity for understanding 
 it. And our reasons for this new effort are:— 
 
 ^ uch objects are in keeping with the genius of the people. The 
 
 great distinguishing feature of the Chinese from the very earliest 
 times has been their attachment to literature, and the honour they 
 have set upon it. Their hero has been not the warrior, nor even the 
 statesman, but the scholar. This national sentiment has been fruitful 
 of many beneficent results. Amongst others it has led them, during 
 all their eras, to pay very great attention to education; and this, in 
 its turn, has produced a large proportion of readers, a high regard for 
 books, one uniform written language, and a system of competitive 
 examinations which until recent years was unparalleled in any part 
 of the world.

 CVhese features have struck every observer who has landed on their 
 shores, and led all who sought to influence the empire, to seek to 
 avail themselves of the press. But the question has always been in 
 regard to suitable books. The difficulties of the language, the peculiarities 
 of Chinese modes of thought and expression, and their tremendous 
 literature, which required to be mastered less or more before efficient 
 books could be produced, called a halt. 
 
 CV/N the opening days of modern intercourse missionaries felt it to be 
 their first duty to give them the Scriptures in their own tongue, 
 and epitomes of Divine Truth in different forms. But it has been 
 increasingly felt by all, of late years, that something more was needed. 
 Accordingly, not a few have been led to compose works on Geography, 
 History, Astronomy, and the various branches of science, and also to 
 attempt periodical literature in its different branches. 
 
 t*> mall editions of these works have been issued and they have been 
 prized in proportion as they became known. This has encouraged 
 us to proceed in that direction; but larger funds are needed to spread 
 such books even to a moderate extent in this wide empire. And this 
 is well worth the effort of all interested in China: for it is absolutely 
 clear that we can never open up the country satisfactorily until we 
 open the minds of the people. 
 
 S he opposition which is offered to Western views, plans, and efforts 
 of all kinds mercantile, political, and religious, is almost entirely 
 due to ignorance. And this is true both as regards local officials, the 
 gentry or literati, the censorate, and even of some of the high officials 
 in Peking. It is therefore of the very highest importance that this 
 ignorance be dispelled, and knowledge diffused through all classes of 
 the people. 
 
 .vvj oeeovee we have found that in cases where high officials at 
 ( 3 ^ Peking and enlightened Mandarins were prepared to accede to 
 foreign proposals, the local literati interfered, and effectually blocked 
 all proceedings. But these literati abound in every part of the empire, 
 and are held in the highest esteem; in fact are the very soul of the 
 empire and virtually rule it. It is therefore manifest that if we would 
 influence China at all as a nation, we must begin with them; and also 
 that it is only in proportion as we command their respect that affairs will 
 move smoothly in China, especially in the higher and larger departments.

 gain these students of the present day will in the course of a few 
 C*7 years fill all the mandarinates in the empire, and all posts of auth¬ 
 ority in the neighbouring countries, as rulers, consuls, and others; be 
 the high ministers of state who will negotiate treaties and deal with 
 the affairs of foreign nations, represent the interests of China at 
 foreign courts; and in short, affect the happiness and prosperity of 
 not only the 360,000,000 of their own country but the interests of 
 foreign merchants and nations. While therefore we would not over¬ 
 look the masses of the people—manifestly the rising literary men 
 demand our most careful attention—the more so as they are not a 
 reading “ caste;’ 7 but spring from and are related to families high 
 and low, in every quarter of the land, and are the oracles of their 
 neighbourhoods. 
 
 c*j)UT these men are those most amenable to our books. We can 
 Cy visit them at their homes: we can meet them at their periodic 
 examinations. They respect scholars; they prize books; they possess 
 many of the characteristics of genuine students. They are in a 
 measure open to reason, are prepared to consider and discuss whatever 
 is placed before them; and are particularly quick to see the advantage 
 of much of our knowledge and suggestions. These remarks are 
 especially true of the younger men, many of whom now evince a very 
 marked desire for new knowledge. Their hostility to us, from their 
 stand point, is patriotic. Convince them of their mistake and they 
 often become our friends. We have repeatedly found that a gift of 
 some of our best books has disarmed their opposition; and we seriously 
 believe that by no other plan can we so powerfully conduce to the 
 allaying of their prejudices and the winning of the nation as the wide 
 distribution of such books as we contemplate. 
 
 kNE thing which has greatly encouraged us is that the government 
 of the empire now view matters in a great measure as we do. They 
 have step by step come to see the importance of a knowledge of foreign 
 countries and science, not only for themselves but also for their 
 people; and they have during the past spring officially announced their 
 decision to add certain questions on foreign subjects to the examination 
 papers, and to grant honours and substantial prizes to such as distinguish 
 themselves. They have further shown their determination to carry 
 out this object by establishing five new Colleges at Tientsin for 
 instruction in military, naval, engineering, electrical and medical

 science; and are at present also building a large seminary fitted 
 to receive 300 students in which young men may receive the elements 
 of the English language, and the first principles of science prior to 
 entering these Colleges. 
 
 C>hese are perhaps the most important and far reaching measures 
 which have, as yet, been promulgated by those in power. The 
 extending of the examination questions touches the empire in all its 
 extent, and reaches every town and hamlet and study in the land, and 
 it will ultimately lead every student, schoolmaster, and scholar to procure 
 and master books on western subjects. It therefore behoves us to have 
 suitable books ready for them, adapted to their capacities and calculated 
 to guide them ill the paths of knowledge, official probity, and moral 
 rectitude. 
 
 he way now seems to be open. We have some books ready; there 
 are others in preparation; we have freedom of travel in all 
 directions. We have friends in many of the provincial capitals and 
 chief cities who will be delighted to help us. We have post, steamer, 
 and courier at our command. The power therefore seems in our own 
 hands. What we lack chiefly is funds. 
 
 C> he revolution which books and periodicals have wrought in our 
 own Western countries greatly encourage us to proceed; for in 
 point of ability to understand our books and facilities of intercom¬ 
 munication, China is almost as fully prepared now as Europe was fifty 
 years ago; and thus we may reasonably hope that by a judicious selection 
 of subjects, careful preparation, striking and suitable illustrations, and 
 wise measures for circulation, we may as thoroughly penetrate the 
 empire, and as effectually change the opinions and action of China as 
 the Press has done during the past half century in Britain, Germany, 
 and America. 
 
 J T seems to us therefore that there could hardly be an association of 
 more importance to China, and to all interested in her welfare, 
 than the one we now commend to your consideration.

 mHE Accounts to 31st October, 1887, shew a loss on the year’s working 
 JL of$573.43 which is almost covered by subscriptions already promised 
 to the Special Fund, established for the purpose of meeting such deficits. 
 During the year no assistance in shape of money has come from the 
 parent Society. The gratuitous work done is estimated to have cost 
 $322,75. 
 
 The outstanding accounts at date of Balance amount to $1,192.98 of 
 which about $800 have been collected. The value of work on hand not 
 completed at same date is $693.80. From these figures it will be seen 
 that a capital of at least $1,000 is required to work the business. Up till 
 now Dr. Williamson has been supplying this capital and is willing to 
 continue doing so for a time. Friends are making a special effort to 
 raise funds during ensuing year to provide the capital. 
 
 The sum due to Dr. Williamson arises partly from the increase 
 in plant during the year to extent of $718.70 and it is suggested 
 that the Special Fund be added to by additional subscriptions to an 
 extent to meet this. 
 
 At the Directors’ meeting in November, Dr. Williamson mentioned 
 that he had two sums on hand of <£30 and £112. 10s. As these sums 
 represent donations to special objects connected with the Society 
 rather than to the Society itself they have not been brought into the 
 accounts. The latter sum has been reduced to the extent of about 
 one-half by liquidating an account due to this Society, for work 
 connected with these objects. 
 
 No budget has been prepared for the coming year but the accounts 
 now submitted indicate all normal expenditure and prospects of in¬ 
 creasing business raise the expectation that no deficit will result on 
 the working. 
 
 For the special work of the Society an amount of about £600 is 
 expected during the year from the parent Society and it is also proposed 
 to reserve for it the local annual subscriptions.
