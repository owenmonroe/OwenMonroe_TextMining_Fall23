Explanation of the column headed “ Thermometrical Register."
The Thermometrical Register commences with Nov. 1853, and closes with Oct. 1854,
inclusive. These registers have been carefully copied from those made at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, and which are also deposited with the Royal Society. They
show the highest and lowest ranges within each twenty-four hours, from twelve different
readings. Each month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most
ready and advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register
of the last two months of 1833 follows the ten months of 1854, which are all we can give
up to the day of publication.
Explanation of the columns headed “ Length of day.” “Day's increase or decrease,"
“Day breaks,” and “ Twilight ends."
The column headed “Length of day” contains the number of hours and minutes
between sunrise and sunset. The column headed “Day's increase
expresses the
number of hours and minutes which the day has increased since the shortest day; and,
where the column is headed “Day's decrease,” it expresses the number of hours and
minutes which the day has decreased since the longest day; for example, the length of
the longest day in 1853 is put down in the column “Length of day" at 16h. 34m.;
and on the 6th of July following we find that the length of the day, or the number of
hours and minutes between sunrise and sunset, is set down at 16h. 24m.; hence the
day has decreased 10m. since the longest day, and, accordingly, in the column “Day's
decrease,” we find opposite July the 6th Oh. 10m.
Equation of Time.
In this Almanac the calculations are all made for mean time (given by the clock),
instead of apparent time (given by the sun-dial), which latter had been used up to the
It must be obvious that, for all practical purposes, mean time is the most
useful; and to obtain it from apparent time, the columns in the Almanac headed
Equation of Time" should be used. The column“ Equation of Time" ought, for
example, to be consulted when persons are desirous of setting their clock by a sun-dial.
When clock after sun is written above the number of minutes and seconds opposite to the
day, then the clock ought to be set so much slower than the sun-dial, and the contrary.
Moonlight.
Tue Moon's age is set down in days and the nearest tenths of days from the time of
change. Thus it is New Moon on the 16th of February at 6h. 47m. afternoon, and there.

AUXILIARY TABLE FOR FINDING THE TIME OF SUN.
RISING AND SETTING.
The time of Sunrise and Sunset in the British Almanac' is adapted to the parallel of
latitude in which London is situated- viz. 51° 30'.
The following table has been constructed to show the variations of time through the
United Kingdom-namely, between the latitude of 589 and 500 10' N. The times of
sun-rising and sun-setting are computed for the instant that the sun's centre is even
with the horizon of the sea. The number of minutes found in this table under the
month-day, and in the required latitude, are to be applied to the time of sun-rising
and setting found on that day in the Almanac; the result will be the time of his
rising and setting at the place required.-Ex. At what time will the sun rise and
set on May 21 at Edinburgh? The time of sunrise and sunset on that day in the
Almanac is 4h. 3m. A.m., and 7h. 5lm. P.M. In the tables in parallel of 560, in which
Edinburgh is found, and under May 21, are 23 minutes; which, subtracted from
Ah. 3m., leaves 3h. 40m. for time of sunrise; and, added to 7h. 51m., gives 8h. 14m.
for time of sun-setting.
The places which follow the different parallels are situate within 15 miles of latitude
either north or south of it.

To find the time of High Water at the above Places, it will be necessary to add or
subtract the numbers in the above Table, according to the directions here given, to or
from the time of High Water at London, as given in the Calendar for the day required.
For example:--On the 8th of January, the morning High Water at London Bridge
is 4h. 53m. ; the High Water at Dover Harbour is 2h. 56m. earlier; subtract,
according to the direction, 2h. 56m. from 4h. 53m., and the time of High Water at
Dover Harbour on that day will be found to be at lh. 57m. in the morning.

By the Act 1 Will. IV. c. 70, it is enacted that " in the year 1831, and afterwards,
the justices of the peace in every county, riding, or division, for which Quarter-Sessions
of the Peace by law ought to be held, shall hold their general Quarter-Sessions of the
Peace in the first week after the ilth of October, in the first week after the 28th of
December, in the first week after the 31st of March, and in the first week after the
24th of June.” The following list has been computed according to this rule.
The Act 4 and 5 Will. IV. cap. 47, allows a discretionary power to the Justices of
Peace as to the time of holding the Spring Quarter-Sessions, and empowers them to alter

tendent's Department at the Post-Office, has been corrected according to the latest arrangements,
and is of importance, as enabling persons to ascertain the time of receiving and delivering letters,
as well as of forwarding parcels, and otherwise availing themselves of these conveyances. A very
trifling computation wiil enable them also to ascertain the time of the mail passing any of the
intermediate places. The first column gives the distance in miles from London, measured from the
Post-Office; the third is the time of the mail's pasning from, and the last its time passing to, London. The
mails leave the Post-Office, London, every evening at 8. The time mentioned is London time through-

Weight when used for weighing gold, silver,
and precious stones (except diamonds).
But Troy Weight is also used by Apothe-
caries in compounding medicines, and by
them the ounce is divided into 8 drams, and
the dram into 3 scruples, so that the scruple
is equal to 20 grains.
For scientific purposes the grain only is
used; and sets of weights are constructed
in decimal progression, from 10,000 grains
downwards to do of a grain.
The carat, used for weighing diamonds,
is 37 grains. The term, however, when
used to express the fineness of gold, has a
relative meaning only. Every mass of
alloyed gold is supposed to be divided into
24 equal parts; thus the standard for coin
is 22 carats fine, that is, it consists of 22
parts of pure gold, and 2 parts of alloy.

I. THE PROGRESS OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE
EARTH'S MOTION, BETWEEN THE TIMES OF CO-
PERNICUS AND GALILEO; BEING NOTES ON THE
ANTEGALILEAN COPERNICANS.
Any reader of the common accounts of astronomical history might
suppose that the moment Copernicus sowed the dragon's teeth, a
host of armed controversialists arose from out of the ground, and
proceeded to mutual slaughter. This arises from the manner in
which popular writers are naturally led to pass over an intervening
time, and to bring their readers at once to the story of Galileo and
the Inquisition. But when it is remembered that this period of ex.
citement begins with the construction of the telescope in 1609, and
that the work of Copernicus was published in 1543, it will appear
that there is a term of no less than 66 years during which the pro-
gress of opinion is to be accounted for. That is, the contemporaries
of Galileo looked back upon the announcement of the motion of the
earth just as we look back upon the commencement of the first
French revolution.
During this term of 66 years, the question was not, properly speak-
ing, discussed. Various writers gave opinions, but no book was
written against another book. Some leaned towards the actual
motion of the earth : some got no further than the armission of that
motion as a very simple anii efficacious way of deducing the plane-
tary motions. Some thought that the diurnal motion only could be
maintained : others were equally in favour of the motion round the
The difference between a physical and a mathematical use of the
Copernican or any other theory, is one which is rather puzzling to a
reader unaccustomed to such considerations. A mathematical
Copernican was one who saw that, come how it might, the heavenly
appearances are such as would take place if the earth did move about
the sun, and also about its own axis : and that, consequently, the
sun.

supposition of such motions, true or false, would be a convenient and
efficacious mode of explaining and predicting celestial phenomena.
A physical Copernican added to the above the belief that the reason
why things appear as they would if the earth had these motions, is
that it really has them. The first said that the hypothesis explains
or demonstrates phenomena; the second said that the hypothesis is a
true statement of the causes which produce phenomena.
Every person who knows the heavenly motions, as they appear
before our eyes, and has a little knowledge of geometry, must be a
mathematical Copernican : he cannot fail to see that a Copernican
universe would show the same appearances as that in which we live.
Accordingly, from the moment when the work of Copernicus ap-
peared, the beauty of the explanation was fully acknowledged, and
the author took his place at once among mathematicians of the first
order, both for his own novelties, and for his additions to the old
system. The highest terms of praise are found in the writings of
those who were most opposed to the physical truth of the hypothesis.
Those who were inclined to blame the novelty of the system-for in
every age the production of new opinions meets with reproach-had
their mouths stopped by reference to those among the ancients who
were known to have believed the actual motion of the earth.
It is said that Leonardo da Vinci held the motion of the earth, as
appears by his manuscripts, about 1500: but it does not appear that
he constructed any system of explanations. There was a work of
Calcagnini actually written and made known (divolgo, says Tiraboschi,
which we suppose does not imply printing) before that of Copernicus,
in which the earth's motion was defended: but as the author was
known to have travelled in Poland, where Copernicus had long been
teaching his system in every way except through the press, as well
as for other reasons, the Italians suppose he must have had know-
ledge of Copernicus and his opinions. In 1533, J. Albert Widman-
stadt, afterwards known as an oriental scholar, explained the views of
Copernicus before Clement VII., for which explanation that Pope
presented him with a Greek manuscript, which was preserved at
Monaco in the last century with an inscription by Widmanstadt
recording the gift and the reason.
We shall now give some detached accounts of the mode in which
the system presented itself to those whom we may term its Antega-
lilean supporters or opponents. The dates attached are those of
death, but all the writers belong to the sixteenth century.
Nicholas Copernicus (1543).—The question whether Copernicus
himself was a Copernican in the modern sense of the word is not
easily settled. His phraseology is almost always that of a mathema-
tical Copernican (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note 8). In a very few
places, and cautiously, he leans to the physical truth as probable,
and to the diurnal motion as more probable than the orbital. When
the Congregation of the Index, in 1620, propounded the alterations
under which they could allow his book to be read as a mathematical
hypothesis, they found those alterations very few in number : and,
though confessedly disposed to cancel the whole of Chapter VIII.,
as treating of the truth of the motion of the earth, they were never-
a

theless able to allow it to stand, because the author seemed to be
speaking problematically; whence they only imposed a few verbal al-
terations. Riccioli (Alm. N. ii. 294) affirms Copernicus to have been
a physical* Copernican, and cites the passages which, in his opinion,
prove it; but he does not feel able to get farther than the qualified
statement that Copernicus maintained the motion of the earth as
more probable, or even as demonstrated. The reader who can com-
pare the passages in the page cited with the alterations demanded by
the Congregation in p. 496, will be able to judge for himself: see
also the life of Copernicus in the Penny Cyclopædia.
George Joachim Rheticus (1576).--This celebrated friend of
Copernicus, and one of the principal instigators of his publication,
was himself the first announcer of the forthcoming system, in his
Narratio, &c., published in 1540_(Comp. 1853, p. 9). It may be
collected from this letter that Rheticus was, more than Coper-
nicus, inclined to express his belief in the motion of the earth as
an absolute truth. But the passages which prove this are im-
bedded in accounts of the manner in which the system explains
phenomena, and it would take more space than we can give to put
in evidencet the distinction between the phrases of Copernicus and
those of his herald. The following paragraph, however, will show
the manner in which the account struck another person.
Achilles Gassarus.—His letter (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note *),
written in 1540, upon receipt of a copy of the Narratio from his
friend Rheticus accompanied by a very full private letter, epistola
harum rerum refertissima, was printed at the head of the edition of
the Narratio referred to in the note just cited. No doubt this
private letter gave very explicit statement of the view actually taken
by Rheticus. Delambre (Astr. Mod. vol. i. p. 138) imagines that
it was the work of Copernicus himself which was sent to Gassarus ;
and concludes, from copies being thus issued three years before the
date of the book, that Copernicus delayed its publication even
after it was printed. But this is a mistake : we know perfectly well
that Copernicus never opened his own book, and received the only
copy he ever saw on the very day of his death. Gassarus describes
the publication of Rheticus as of novelty enough to stupefy any
one, as most contrary to the doctrines of the schools, and as what the
monks would certainly call heretical. He instances the motion of
the earth as among the wonders, but enters into no detail, apparently
because he sends on the work itself to his correspondent. We infer,
then, that Rheticus was a physical Copernican. This Gassarus was
the constructor of a series of almanacs, under the title of Prognosticon
a
a
* All the writers who make a similar affirmation in the sixteenth century are op-
ponents, except only Thomas Digges, who stoutly and expressly denies (in 1594) that
Copernicus meant his assertions “onely as mathematical principles fayned, and not as
philosophicall truely averred.”
+ Some give a very different account. In the Penny Cyclopædia (Rheticus), ap-
parently after Zedler, it is stated that this Narratio is ahsolutely written in opposition
to Copernicus," to show that the rotation of the earth about the sun is not a mere
probable hypothesis, as Copernicus had thought fit to announce it, but an incontestable
truth."
And many writers, though not going so far as this, are yet decided in their
statements that Rheticus was a physical Copernican, We arrive at the same opinion
with more difficulty.

Astrologicum. That for 1546 is dedicated to Rheticus, who, says
Gassarus, after the example of his master Copernicus, gave easier
introduction and clearer demonstration to the celestial motions. It
is probable enough that, next afier Rheticus, Gassarus was the first
who ventilated the name of Copernicus in print.
Erasmus Rheinhold (1553).—He was the friend of Copernicus,
and an abettor of the publication ; but his view was very different
from that of Rheticus. In his Prutenic (Prussian) tables, he makes
use of the observations of Copernicus, and he constructs tables of the
planets both on the old and on the Copernican data. He enters into no
discussion, and (according to Delambre) finds no occasion to speak
either of the motion of the earth or of the sun. It must be remarked
that several of the early Copernicans, whatever they might think of
the system physically or mathematically, found their chief source of
admiration in the changes which Copernicus made in the numerical
data of the planetary, and especially of the lunar, theory. These
numerical data might with ease have been transplanted into the Pto-
lemaic system. Rheinhold, then, so far as he declares himself, heads
the school of numericai Copernicans.
Peter Ramus (1572).—This celebrated leader of opinion is
reckoned rather among the philosophers than the mathematicians.
In the common language of our day, those who investigate matter
have usurped the name of philosopher, or rather, perhaps, have had
it usurped for them; while those who were once called philo-
sophers * are now usually called metaphysicians.
This is of no con-
sequence, t except in the confusion it creates: we shall in this
article use the term philosopher in its old sense. Ramus, a thorough
opponent of the old philosophy, began life, when he disputed at Paris
for his degree of master of arts, by offering to maintain the contrary
of any assertion whatsoever of Aristotle. His writings † were censured
by the University of Paris in 1543, the year in which Copernicus
published his great work. He was a correspondent of Rheticus, and
states (Sch, Math. book ii.) that he endeavoured by letter to per-
suade him to free astronomy altogether from hypothesis; and that if
Rheticus had not been obliged by circumstances to betake himself
to the practice of medicine, the mathematics might have had
another Copernicus to celebrate. Ramus, then, was for astronomy
without hypotheses, but with a very high opinion of Copernicus
and of his system as against previous ones ; so far his meaning is
not very clear. Mæstlinus took him literally, as advocating merely
7
* It must, however, he observed, that mind and matter were both subjects of the
ancient philosophy, physics being natural philosophy. The new school advocated
experimental pliilosophy, professing to draw all their conclusions from experiment.
The two terms were antagonists for some time; but at last they coalesced and for
more than a century writers and teachers have talked of natural and experimental
philosophy, a combination which still lingers in the prospectuses of schools and
lectures.
+ It is impossible to keep words to their meanings. The words physician and
naturalist are of the same original meaning, namely, investigators of the external
world; but the first now means a person who looks after the health of men, while the
second means one who looks after the classification, &c. of brutes and vegetabies.
# It is a coincidence of date worth noting, with reference to the attack on the old
system, that the astronomy of Copernicus and the logic of Ramus were published in
the same year.

the determination of numerical data : What, says he, will mere
numerical proportions in the human mind move the heavenly
bodies ? But' Ramus had a very different meaning. In the
work above cited, published in 1569, he presumes that those who
preceded Aristotle, and especially the Chaldæans and Egyptians,
were in possession of an astronomy founded on observation and ex-
periment; that Eudoxus invented the orbs (the crystal spheres in
which the Ptolemaists placed the heavenly bodies), and Aristotle
amended them; that these spheres were not taken as fictions, but as
real and existing ; that the Pythagoreans complicated the system,
and made it more ridiculous, by epicycles and excentrics ; that Co-
pernicus, an astronomer not merely comparable to the ancients, but
one especially to be admired, rejected a whole antiquity of hypotheses,
and revived others, not new indeed, but most excellent, which de-
monstrate astronomy, not from the motion of the stars, but from that
of the earth. He afterwards adds that astronomy wants such men as
Regiomontanus, Copernicus, and Rheinhold, who would contrive a
system, not upon feigned hypotheses, but upon geometry and arith-
metic applied to the truth and nature of the stars themselves.
Such an astronomy, he says, the Chaldæans once had, and the Egyp-
tians and Greeks (semper feriatur Leo) before Aristotle ; such an
astronomy he is satisfied the Germans* might construct, if they would
abandon fabulous hypothesis worked up into something like method
and science. He would throw away all the notions of the ancients,
and even their observations, and begin with the heavens as if they
were only just created, and by aid of new and careful observations,
he would appeal to logic, geometry, and arithmetic, to induce and
infer a general explanation, if indeed there be anything fixed in
celestial phenomena. But if everything really do change from age
to age, then there can never be any science of astronomy. If Ramus
had only so far modified his assertion, as to allow that changes might
possibly follow laws which could be detected, and that the oldest
observations might be useful in detecting the very slow changes,
there would have been nothing to object to in his lecture. As it is,
we see that he is one of the most rational of the Copernicans. Bacon,
indeed, calls him a skulking-hole of ignorance, a pernicious bookworm,
who grasps nothing but the chaff, and so on.
But this is in a paper
intended as a kind of brief to counsel against all the philosophers,
and the expressions must be looked upon as wilfully exaggerated.
But for this, we should have supposed that the English opponent
of the overgrown Greek could not bear the idea of a French alliance.
* By this marked reference to the Germans, the distinguished Frenchman probably
means that there would be theological difficulties in a Catholic country. Luther set
science free from the fear of direct interference. But it must not be supposed that the
rule of the church over opinion in philosophy was an invention of the sixteenth century.
In the preceding ages, when every man of learning was a priest, it was exceedingly
common for those who cultivated philosophy to invent applications to, and illustrations
from, theology. To suppose that the church would not watch this philosophy would
be exactly the same thing as supposing it would not watch the theology taught by its
own priests; and none were more on the watch than the philosophers themselves, each
over i he rest, a few over themselves. Hence the habit which procured even for the
laymen of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that blessed order of things
which is briefly illustrated in the table of contents of Hallam's Literature of Europe, as
follows:-" The Jansenists take a distinction, page 271; and are persecuted, page 272."

Notes on the Antegalilean Copernicans.
Francis Maurolycus (1575).-On the fear shown by Maurolycus
(Comp. 1853, p. 9) that the question of the earth's motion was likely
to be agitated, we may add to our mention of Calcagnini and Wid-
manstadt the tradition that, so early as 1530, Copernicus was ridi-
culed on the stage in his native country. Maurolycus disposes of the
whole question by saying that Copernicus is more worthy of a'whip-
ping * than a refutation. In palliation, it must be remembered that
the day of reviews was not yet come, when Maurolycus might have
quietly carried his views into practice, under profession of impartial
examination. New truths often go through a time of whipping be-
fore refutation comes on, and when the refutation is quite complete,
they begin to be admitted. Then comes another fermentation, in
which either the reputed author is shown to be not the real original,
or else he is blamed for not going far enough : this stage over, his
statue is erected, he receives divine honours, some of the doings of
his successors are attributed to him, and those who would have
whipped him, if he had arrived in their day, make him a bulwark
against further progress.
Francis Bacon (1626).-—Bacon asks whether there be a system at
all, that is, a spherical universe with some one body immoveable in
its centre. He remarks that all, except Copernicus (he means the
ancients and Gilbert), of those who have maintained the motion of
the earth, sprinkle the stars through the universe like islands in the
ocean, and reject the common centre, which Copernicus maintained,
placing the sun in it. If there be a system, the sun and the earth
contend for the central place. The sun, as of greatest efficacy, and
as vivifying and animating the universe, seems very properly placed
in the middle; and the more so, as Mercury and Venús, at least, are
his satellites. But the Copernican system has the inconveniences of
loading the earth with three different motions, of separating the sun
from the planets, of introducing a great deal of immobility (all the
fixed stars being reputed immoveable), and of connecting the moon
with the earth as in an epicycle. If the motion of the earth be al-
lowed, it seems that there should be no system at all. All this is
a
* We have always supposed, with all who have read the passage, that Maurolycus
intended to say that Copernicus ought to have a whipping ; but on looking once more,
we are inclined to suspect that his meaning was not quite so savage. It should be
noted that Maurolycus is apt to express disdain rather than indignation. Of Cardan he
says, that he is so ridiculous that he is more worthy of contempt than of reprobation ;
of Erasmus, that he must not call himself a theologian who plays the parasite in silly
colloquies. In the article now in question he has been describing the sphere, and pro-
ceeds to say that he does not pretend to supersede other books. He then names some
erroneous authors, against whose faults he hopes the reader may be protected by what
he has written. He then goes on as follows :— Toleratur et Nicolaus Copernicus, qui
solem fixum et terram in girum circumverti posuit ; et scutica potius, aut fiagello, quam
reprehensione dignus est. This we conjecture may mean that he would also tolerate
N. Copernicus, who makes the sun stand still and the earth whirl round and round
[after the manner of a boy's top]; and is more worthy of a whip (to keep his playthiny
up with] than of a grave rebuke. The usual translation hardly consists with itself; the
notion that to whip an astronomer is to tolerate him is utterly rejected at Greenwich
and at Somerset House ; and a person cannot merit the greater punishment more than
the smaller one. He who deserves a whipping, à fortiori, deserves a rebuke; but here
the scutica is spoken of as the lesser, the reprehensio as the graver, punishment.
Whichever way it may be, it is to be noted that Maurolycus did not give the last cor-
rections to this work, as he died while it was being printed, or perhaps beforee th
printing commenced.

not meant for conclusion, but for reflexion preliminary to inquiry.
Bacon afterwards, in the Novum Organum, lays it down as for
examination, whether the motions of the earth be real, or only con-
venient hypotheses for calculation ; and this, separately and distinctly,
both for the diurnal and the orbital motions. In his ideas of astro-
nomy he perfectly agrees with Ramus, but goes further. It is de-
graded, he says, by being placed among the mathematical arts, when
it should be the noblest part of physics. It ought to show the sub-
stances, motions, and influences of the heavenly bodies as they really
are; but it gives us only the numbers and motions of the stars. The
observations and hypotheses lead only to ingenious representations,
but are not the real causes and truth of things. So that astronomy
is like the stuffed hide which Prometheus imposed on Jupiter for an
ox, with a fair outside, but neither flesh nor entrails. So far as
masses and attractions are substances and influences, what Bacon de-
sired is now obtained : he wants something beyond simple geometry.
In the Novum Organum Bacon expressly lays down the question
of the earth's motion as one to be examined. In the De Aug-
mentis he says that the absurdity and complication of the Ptolemaic
system has driven men to the doctrine of the earth's motion, which
is clearly false, quod nobis constat falsissimum esse. In another place
he lays it down that this doctrine cannot be opposed by astronomy,
but can be opposed by the principles of natural philosophy, correctly
exhibited. We rather suspect, putting all the passages together,
that when Bacon impugns that doctrine as manifestly false which he
elsewhere propounds for inquiry, he is taking, for the moment, an
advocate's license, in aggravation of the case against the Ptolemaic
system. This licence, it seems to us, he often takes. The whole of
what he has said on this subject, when put together, does not justify
Hume's assertion that he rejected the Copernican system “with the
most positive disdain.” Like so many others of his day, his view
is of one colour or another, according as he is thinking of astronomy
or of physics. We take the opinion of the Novum Organum to
be better cured than that of the De Augmentis—because Bacon
valued the first more than any other of his writings,-because the
first is wholly systematic and argumentative, the second more ap-
proaching the discursive and rhetorical,--and because, though the
Latin of the second was published three* years after the first, yet
the second is known to have been written before the first.
not among the strongest admirers of Bacon, yet we cannot help think-
ing that, on this point, he has not been fairly represented.
Joh. Bapt. Benedictus (1590).-In a letter published in 1585,
but probably written long before, he gives a cautious reasoning in
favour of the earth's motion, without committing himself, as being
what a person might say who used his reason without any light from
above (i. e., from the Inquisition). He rejects the mechanical diffi-
culty, because the air and water would have the same natural impetus
of motion as the earth itself. He even gives a hint of the plurality

* The dates of publication are 1620 and 1623. But it is incredible that Bacon should
have absolutely pronounced, in 1623, upon a question (and such a question) left open
among things to be carefully examined in 1620.

of worlds. Those who follow Aristarchus and Copernicus will never
believe that the whole creation is merely meant as an arrangement
in favour of the centre of the lunar epicycle. Benedictus, or Bene-
detti, is placed by Libri very high among the Italians of the six-
teenth century, though little known to those of our day.
Tycho Brahé (1601).—The system of Tycho Brahé, imagined
in or about 1587, combines, as he intended it to do, the mathematical
advantages of the system of Copernicus, with absence of any con-
tradiction to the mechanics and physics of his time. In asserting
the absolute stability of the earth, and the daily motion of the whole
universe round it, he agrees with the Ptolemaists ; but he makes all
the planets (except the moon) move round the sun, while the sun
itself moves round the earth. Thus Tycho was a mathematical
Copernican and a physical Ptolemaist. He is the strongest of all
the admirers of Copernicus. Of Longomontanus, we need only
mention that he was a follower of Tycho, whose writings do not come
within our period.
Christopher Rothmann (1596).—He was the friend of Tycho Brahé,
and, at one time, his follower. But, as appears by a letter of Tycho
written in 1595, he was then a defender both of the annual and
diurnal motion of the earth. He was, then, a physical Copernican
at the end of his life, a fact not noted by the historians. He is
known as a writer only by his published correspondence with
Tycho Brahé.
Didacus à Stunica.--He was of Toledo, and published a com-
mentary (afterwards among the prohibited works) on the book of
Job, of the date of which we only know that one * edition is said to
be of 1584. The writer appears to be a physical Copernican, and
his work is the first in which the Bible argument is discussed by a
Copernican. It was afterwards prohibited ; and what Lalande calls
the prohibited letter of Zuniga, is probably a reprint of so much of
Stunica’st comment as related to the subject. This writer may be,
probably, the originator of the argument found in his book, that the
words of Job—“Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the
pillars thereof tremble,”-prove that the earth moves. The other
party replied triumphantly that the very words prove that the earth
has a place, out of which she can only be moved by the special
interference of the Creator.
Francis Patrizi, or Patricius (1597).--Here is another philoso-
pher, even whose name has not been noticed by the mathematical
historians of this subject. Riccioli has, indeed, got Peter Ramus in
his list, and asks whether he he the medical man who is mentioned
by Junctinus (a collector of nativities) as having been born in 1532,
at 23 minutes after 3 in the afternoon of February 22. He knows

* The index of prohibited books ought to give some information on this point; but
the bibliographer has to regret that this catalogue is the worst of all catalogues. We
have before us one published at Rome, about 1745. Very few books are dated or
described ; and we learn that every anonymous Disputatio de Festo Corporis Christi
must be forbidden; everv Historia de Germanorum origine; and every book having
the title De disciplina puerorum, recteque formandis eorum studiis et moribus. Such
is the effect of prohibiting anonymous works, under nothing but titles.

only the author of the Schole Mathematice, and seems never to have
heard that this writer was also the philosophical heretic who shook
the schools of Paris. ()f Patricius he know's nothing, though he
makes one quotation from him. In a former article (Comp. 1836),
we see that Fienus of Louvain associates one Bernard Patricius with
Copernicus, and cites no other maintainers of the earth's motion by
For eighteen years we have looked, from time to time, at
biographies and histories, that we might discover this lost Coper-
nican, if possible. We have recently found that Fienus made a mis-
take in the Christian name, and that Francis* Patricius is the person
intended. This philosopher was a noted opponent of Aristotle, but
not in the usual manner: he strove to revive Platonism. Among
his modes of doing this, we may mention his collection of points on
which he conceived Plato was orthodox, and Aristotle was not,
according to the orthodoxy of Rome. His own orthodoxy does not
seem to have served his turn, for De Thou tells us that his doctrine
was censured by ecclesiastical authority, and that he was obliged to
retract. Tiraboschi (who has given a fuller general account) doubts
this, on the ground that the work of which we shall speak is studded
with the postillæ of a certain priest, da Lugo by name, whose business
it was to make such remarks as would be sufficient preservatives
against heresy. This very circumstance seems to show that the author
was a suspected person : and we may hazard a conjecture that he
had fallen into disgrace, had made his pur si muove recantation all
right and regular, and had been allowed to publish, on condition of
admitting the inspection and comment of a dry nurse of safer
principles than his own. Nevertheless, Patricius was invited to
Rome by Clement VIII., in 1592, and, in spite of Cardinal Bel-
larmine and other powerful Aristotelians, taught the Platonic philo-
sophy there until his death.
The work of which we are to speak is the Nova de Universis
Philosophia, Venice, 1593,6 but having subordinate titles, dated
Ferrara, 1591, and evidently ready in that year. Patricius describes
the systems of Copernicus and Tycho Brahé, and declares altogether
against the orbital motion of the earth; he thinks it impossible. In
common with a great number of natural (and experimental) philoso-
phers of every age, he sets out with his notion, founded upon the
knowledge he possesses, of what is possible and what is impossible
in physics : and, in common with the same philosophers, he is very
little disposed to allow his reader any appeal from his own pre-
conceptions. When he comes to examine the diurnal motion of the
earth, he cites in favour of it Nicetas, Philolaus, Heraclides, Ecphan-
tus, Seleucus, and Aristarchus, before, whose authority that of
Aristotle and Ptolemy falls to the ground. He adds Copernicus,
whom he calls the greatest astronomer of the age. Having thus
cleared the field, he begins to examine the possibilities of the case.
Since the stars appear to move in a circle, they must either be

title-page of 1593 is a new one. The excessive rarity of the work has prevented it from

.
carried round with the heavens, or each must have its own separate
motion, or the earth must have a rotation. The first supposition he
pronounces impossible, on account of the immense rapidity of the
motion. The second supposition is impossible as to the more distant
stars, possible, perhaps, as to the nearer ones, and possible enough
as to the nearest. That the earth should revolve is more consonant
to reason than either of the other suppositions. He cites cases of
apparent motion, such as that of the shores to those in a ship, and
pronounces a similar deception to be very likely as to the stars. It
is remarkable that Father da Lugo, the dry nurse, says not a word
against these speculations ; his annotations on the chapter which
contains them refer only to the question whether the sun and
planets are animated bodies. And we must infer, from the later facts
of the life of Patricius, that from 1592 to 1597, the probable
diurnal motion of the earth was taught at Rome, under the patronage
of the Pope.
Christian Urstisius (1588).—He was a professor at Basle, who
wrote on the planetary theory of Purbach, and published a book on
arithmetic, which was translated into English. Nothing more is
known of him, except the one circumstance which will immortalise
his name he publicly taught the theory of Copernicus, in some
lectures which he gave in Italy, and is supposed to have made a
convert of Galileo. (Drinkwater-Bethune, Life of Galileo, p. 7).
William Gilbert (1603).—This is the celebrated writer on the
magnet; and in his work (1600) he declares in the strongest terms
for the diurnal motion of the earth, as not only probable, but
manifestly true. His chief reason is the enormous motion which the
heavens would otherwise have. He passes over the orbital and
precessional motions, as being beside his purpose to treat of. Bacon
describes him as distinctly opposing all except the diurnal motion ;
and this description, probably the result of private conversation, was
somewhat confirmed by the posthumous publication (in 1651) of
Gilbert's work, De mundo nostro sublunari philosophia nova. Gilbert
here finds Tycho Brahé's difficulty of the immense void between the
solar system and the fixed stars, and Bacon's difficulty of the three
motions. But he does not draw a positive conclusion, and he treats
with contempt the notion that the earth must be the centre.
Edward Wright (1615),—This eminent discoverer in the art of
navigation does not give the least appearance of abandoning the old
system, either in his work on navigation or in that on the sphere.
But in an encomiastic address, as he calls it, written for Gilbert, and
prefixed by Gilbert to the work on the magnet, he discusses the
diurnal motion, points out in strong terms the improbability of the
great motion of the whole sphere of the heavens, decides against the
force of the Scriptural argument, does not see why those who
advocate so difficult a system as the common one should not give
permission to others to adopt something more simple, and ends by
declaring the diurnal motion probable enough (satis probabile esse),
though he does not think that any higher certainty will ever be
arrived at. Wright is evidently doing his best; but, looking at the
character of the panegyrics which it was common for authors to

write in the prefaces of the works of other authors, we are afraid we
cannot with certainty infer more than that he was so near the line of
demarcation that it did not hurt his conscience to step over it to
serve a friend. This address was written before 1600; in 1613
Wright published his work on the sphere, the very title-page of
which indicated a Ptolemaist in an unusually marked manner. The
book has not even an allusion to the motion of the earth, nor any
thing to the point, except the statement that the primum mobile is
imagined by the astronomers to show the reason of that dayly
motion.” The old system is here reduced to an hypothesis.
Christopher Clavius (1612).—This celebrated Jesuit, whose depth
of learning was the admiration of his age, calls Copernicus (in 1570)
the excellent restorer of astronomy, whom all posterity will grate-
fully celebrate and admire as a second Ptolemy. But he rejects the
actual motion of the earth as absurd, contrary to the senses, and
rash (temeraria, the word applied to doctrines suspected of heresy
before they were actually condemned). He brings forward the
arguments against the earth's motion from the ancients and the
Scriptures. It is said that, in his collected edition of his own works,
prepared in 1611, just after the discovery of Jupiter's satellites, he
gave it as his opinion that the old system would no longer do, and
that another must be looked for; but we have no reference to the
place, and the collection is in five folio volumes. Our authority for
the assertion is Foscarini, who made it in 1615.
Francis Vieta (1603). — It would be difficult to find anything to
the point in the printed writings of the greatest French mathema-
tician of the sixteenth century, except in one word. He refers to
mathematical tables made by certain rhapsodists. As he was well
versed in Greek, and pedantically fond of introducing words from it,
we should have passed this over, if we had not found the word
rhapsodist in contemporary writers, used in our modern sense. The
makers of tables were Rheticus and Rheinhold, both Lutherans and
both Copernicans ; for which reason Vieta, when forced to allude to
them, only names them by a term of contempt. Those who have
examined the manuscript of his Harmonicon Cæleste report that he
thinks the excellence, if any, of the system of Copernicus, is
destroyed by the badness of its geometry. This is the most singular
of all the opinions which were uttered on the subject.
Michael Mæstlin, or Mestlinus (1631).–Successively a Professor
at Heidelberg and Tubingen, made his first appearance, at what age
is not known, as a writer on the new star of 1572. Tycho Brahé
(De Nova Stella, pp. 543-8) has inserted a writing of his entire,
and
says of him, that, though he had but a thread to observe with, he
had come nearer the mark than several who had used elaborate in-
struments. Mæstlinus is known as the preceptor and correspondent
of Kepler, as one of the opponents of Clavius in the matter of the
calendar, as the constructor of ephemerides, and as the author of an
epitome of astronomy, which was several times reprinted. The com-
mon story of his having lectured on the Copernican doctrine in Italy,
and having made a convert of Galileo, is sufficiently disposed of by
Drinkwater-Bethune (Galileo, p. 7); it seems clear enough that

Notes on the Antegalilean Copernicans.
Vossius confounded Mæstlinus with Urstisius of Basle. Had Coper-
nican opinion been a little more closely watched, it would have been
evident that Mästlinus could not have taught Galileo an extent of
Copernicanism which he himself never held. Weidler, and many
others after him, place the death of Mæstlinus in 1590 ; but his cor-
respondence with Kepler extends to 1620, and he edited an enlarged
edition of his own epitome in 1624. Our date of his death is given
without authority by Drinkwater-Bethune. Riccioli places Mæst-
linus among his Copernicans, on the strength of additions made by
him to the Narratio of Rheticus, in the republication of that Coper-
nican writing, in the Prodromus of Kepler in 1596. But any one
who will examine the Appendix M. M. de dimensione orbium et
sphærarum cælestium juxta Tabulas Prutenicas ex sententia N.
Copernici, either in the Prodromus itself or in Kepler's correspond-
ence, will see that Mæstlinus professes no more than adherence to
the dimensions given by Copernicus. He held by the system as an
hypothesis for the calculation of the places of the heavenly bodies.
His private opinion (as given in correspondence with Kepler) was
that astronomers should let physics alone, as rather disturbing than
informing the reader. Throughout all his writings, from that published
by Tycho Brahé up his last edition of his own epitome, there is
much on Copernican numerals, but little on Copernican opinions.
And yet he seems to have had a feeling in favour of the reality of his
notions ;
and on one occasion, unwittingly, his favourite word hypo-
thesis was but a synonyme for an agent. We have already cited his
remark on Ramus ; now an hypothesis in the human mind will no
more move a heavenly body than would a numerical proportion.
The most decided expression of opinion which we can find, occurs
in one of the additions which he made to his epitome in 1624, pos-
terior, it must be noted, to the time when the Inquisition began to
interfere in Italy. Speaking of the enormous revolution of the
primum mobile, he says, Among all the reasons which gave
Copernicus occasion to think of other hypotheses, and other disposi-
tions of the heavenly bodies, more consonant to reason, nature, and
observation, this incredible velocity is not the last, if indeed it be
not the very first.” The word in italics is the strongest proof we can
find that the reputed master of Galileo was at all inclined even to hint
at what he is said to have taught.
Jordanus Brunus, or Giordano Bruno (1600).—He was first a
Dominican priest, then a Calvinist; and was roasted alive at Rome,
in 1600, for as many heresies of opinion, religious and philosophical,
as ever lit one fire. Some defenders of the papal cause have at least
worded their accusations so to be understood as imputing to hin
villanous actions. But it is positively certain that his death was due
to opinions alone, and that retractation, even after sentence, would
have saved him. There exists a remarkable letter, written from
Rome on the very day of the murder, by Scioppius (the celebrated
scholar, a waspish convert from Lutheranism, known by his hatied
to Protestants and Jesuits) to Rittershusius, a well-known Lutheran
writer on civil and canon law, whose works are in the index of pro-
hibited books. This letter has been reprinted by Libri (vol. iv.

p. 407). The writer informs his friend (whom he wished to con-
vince that even a Lutheran would have burnt Bruno) that all Rome
would tell him that Bruno died for Lutheranism ; but this is because
the Italians do not know the difference between one heresy and
another, in which simplicity (says* the writer), may God preserve
them. He then proceeds to describe to his Protestant friend (to
whom he would certainly not have omitted any act which both their
churches would have condemned) the mass of opinions with which
Bruno was charged ; as that there are innumerable worlds, that
souls migrate, that Moses was a magician, that the Scriptures are a
dream, that only the Hebrews descended from Adam and Eve, that
the devils would be saved, that Christ was a magician and deservedly
put to death, &c. In fact, says he, Bruno has advanced all that was
ever brought forward by all heathen philosophers, and by all heretics,
ancient and modern. Å time for retractation was given, both before
sentence and after, which should be noted, as well
for the wretched
palliation which it may afford, as for the additional proof it gives
that opinions, and opinions only, brought him to the stake.
The work of Bruno in which his astronomical opinions are con-
tained is De Monade, &c., Frankfort, 1591, 8vo. He is the most
thorough-going Copernican possible, and throws out almost every
opinion, true or false, which has ever been discussed by astronomers,
from the theory of innumerable inhabited worlds and systems to
that of the planetary nature of comets. Libri (vol. iv.) has re-
printed the most striking part of his expressions of Copernican
opinion.
Nicolas Raimarus Ursus Dithmarsus (1600 ?) published works on
astronomy in 1588 and 1597, in which he claims the invention of
Tycho's system, and charges Tycho with plagiarism. Tycho made
the same charge against him ; and probably neither charge is true :
both were scurrilous. But he makes a great mistake when he imagines
that his system agrees with that of Tycho. The difference lies in this,
that Tycho combined the reputed advantages of both systems, while
Ursus (to choose the name which best represents his style) managed
to introduce the alleged disadvantages of both. Tycho, by fixing
the earth, avoided the mechanical difficulties which were then un-
answerable ; while, by making the sun a centre of motion for all the
planets, he introduced nearly all the mathematical advantages of the
* That is to say, they knew the difference between a live heretic and a roasted one
by actual inspection, but hail no idea of the difference between a Lutheran and a
Calvinist. The countrymen of Boccacio would have smiled at the idea which the
German scholar entertained of them. They said Bruno was burnt for Lutheranism, a
name under which they classed all Protestants : and they are better witnesses than
Schopp or Scioppius.
ť Hi this medley of charges the Scriptures are a dream, while Adam, Eve, devils,
and salvation are truths, and the Saviour a deceiver. We have examined no work of
Bruno except the De Monade, &c. mentioned in the text. A strong though strange
theism runs through the whole, and Moses, Christ, the fathers, &c. are cited in a manner
which excites no remark either way. Among the versions of the cause of Bruno's
death is atheism : but this word was very often used to denote rejection of revelarion,
not merely in the common course of dispute, but by such writers, for instance, as
Brucker anil Morhof. Thus Morhof says of the De Monade, &c., that it exhibits no
manifest signs of atheism. What he means by the word is clear enough, when he thus
speaks of a work which acknowledges God in hundreds of places, and rejects opinions
as blasphemous in several.

Copernican system. Ursus, by allowing to the earth a diurnal ro-
tation, introduced all the mechanical difficulties ; while, by giving
orbital motion to the sun, he lost some of the simplicity and truth of
the Copernican system without anything in exchange.
Joh. Ant. Maginus (1617).-Maginus was one of those whom we
have called numerical Copernicans ; he published works in which
the observatims of Copernicus are used in conjunction with those of
Tycho Brahé. Of Copernicus, he thinks that there is only. Ptoleiny
with whom he can be compared; but when he speaks of the hypo-
thesis physically, he calls it absurd.
Simon Sievinus (1620).-He describes the mathematical hypo-
theses of Ptolemy and Copernicus, without a word of comment on
the great difference between them : insomuch that, when he ends
by desiring every one to think as he pleases, we cannot even gather
that he intends this permission to include the opinion of the earth's
motion ; it may refer merely to the mathematical hypotheses which
he has been describing.
John Kepler (1630).- Though Kepler was the friend and fellow-
labourer of Galileo, yet he has his antegalilean period of reputation,
and it is but fit that he should close such a list as the present. He
lets us know very distinctly that about 1590 he was a defender of
the system of Copernicus on physical or metaphysical grounds; and
that not till after he had arrived at this stage did he see the mathe-
matical superiority of that system, which at length he did see, partly
by the instructions of Mæstlinus, partly by his own efforts. How
he first came by his opinion of the physical truth of Copernicanism,
he does not inform us. The work of Bruno appeared in 1591, in
Germany, and Kepler shows his acquaintance with that work in after
life. He took the degree of Master of Arts in August 1591, and
tells us that he defended Copernicus in the physical disputations of
the candidates. It is just possible that Kepler may have spoken but
vaguely when he says, " about six years ago," and that Bruno may
have been his leader. It should also be noted that a work pro-
fessing Copernicanism was published by Bruno (according to Bayie),
so far back as 1584.
We have before spoken of the earliest English Copernicans, Recorde,
Field, and Digges (Comp. 1837, pp. 35-40 ; and Penny Cyclop.,
“ Motion of the Earth ”). Robert Recorde, in 1556, avowed, in an
elementary work, but in a very cautious manner, his leaning towards
physical Copernicanism. John Dee, in 1556, in his epistle prefixed
to Field's Ephemeris for 1557, said he had hoped that the herculean
labours of Copernicus, Rheticus, and Rheinhold, would have been
heard of in England. He describes them as restoring the science of
astronomy, and supporting their views by the strongest weight of
reasons: disgusted by the neglect of these divine lucubrations, he
had instigated Field to construct an ephemeris from the data of
Copernicus, &c. Field, the pupil of Dee, expresses a similar
opinion : both may be suspected of holding the physical system, but
their expressions are not conclusive. Thomas Digges, in the preface
to the Alæ &c. (1573), engages to publish a work in which the
hitherto exploded paradox of the motion of the earth shall be sup-

ported, at least by probable arguments, and perhaps by the strongest
demonstration. În 1594, he added to a reprint of his father's work
an account and defence of physical Copernicanism, with good answers
to some of the mechanical objections. Rejecting Rheticus and
Rheinhold, the personal friends of Copernicus, the whole Continent
does not produce, by 1573, so large an amount of unbiassed adherence
to any view of the Copernican system as we find given in England
to its physical truth.
But, both in England and abroad, it would seem that the Coper-
nican, when he ventured his opinion, considered his work as con-
signed to circulation among astronomical heretics; and that he never
gave it in any book which he did not wish to risk. Thus the indig-
nant Copernican, John Dee, would not drop a word on that system
in the preface to Billingsley's Euclid (1570), but makes it the office
of astronomy to measure the distance of the planets from the centre
of the earth. John Blagrave, in 1585, after describing the Ptolemaic
system, adds, “ This I say after the opinion of old writers, though
Copernicus hath ascribed another order.” He could go no further ;
but this reduction of the old system to an opinion looks suspicious.
Perhaps Wrights reserve, already mentioned, is to be explained in
There is one more English anti-Copernican to be mentioned,
Thomas Lydiat, who died in 1646. He was a good scholar, and
incurred Joseph Scaliger's severest abuse by beating him on points
of chronology. In his Prelectio Astronomica (1605) he so far
departs from received opinion as to maintain that the stars are not
fixed in solid orbs, but pendent in æther. He almost ignores
Copernicus. In the one mention which he makes of his system, he
refers to the argument derived from the immense velocity of the
fixed stars, and says, that if the followers of Copernicus had never
seen anything swifter than the flight of a bird, the velocity of an
or of a cannon-hall would have been equally incredible.
This was, perhaps, as good an answer as the celebrated objection
deserved. The moderns, who blame their predecessors for not
being willing, with Patricius, to declare a certain amount of velocity
impossible, received with perfect satisfaction the doctrine that light
consists of particles of matter flying 200,000 miles in a second. Had
they followed their own maxims, this velocity would have made
them keep the undulatory theory in view. But though the Copér-
nican system was never allowed to drop out of sight, in spite of the
unanswerable objections to it, the undulatory theory was in total
neglect for a much longer period than that of which we are writing.
Two hundred thousand miles in a second is a much greater velocity
than the Ptolemaists wanted for their primum mobile, a much greater
velocity than that which our school-boys and school-girls are taught
to point the finger at them for admitting.
We have now named all the writers of most note, who treated of
the subject before the invention of the telescope. The discovery of
Jupiter's satellites was the first great blow to the ancient system : it
led many at once to the doctrine of other worlds besides our
Bruno and Kepler had maintained this opinion before the

telescope was known, and Tycho Brahé had held it; but after the
discovery of the satellites, and the resolution of the milky way, it
ceased to be so monstrous as it had till then appeared to be. Sci-
oppius makes this opinion the head and front of his charges against
Bruno, and ends his attempt to settle terms of combustion with his
Lutheran friend by observing that Bruno was gone to tell the inhabit.
ants of the worlds he had invented how blasphemers were treated
at Rome. After the establishment of the distribution of stars
through space, and of separate planets with satellites, the idea of
maintaining that no star except our own had its inhabitants of some
kind seemed to most like a declaration from the insects on one leaf
that there was no life except their own in the whole forest.
Truly, says James Hume (a Scutchman, settled at Paris, well
known in the mathematical world) in 1637, if I could only believe
with the Copernicans that the earth moves round the sun, I should
at once be persuaded that the earth and planets are of one kind, and
that all of them, if not the fixed stars also, have air, water, earth,
beasts, birds, and fishes, either such as ours or different. He omits
man, probably on account of the theological question it would have
raised; this question is at the bottom of the dispute now in progress.
It must be remembered that the system imagined (and perhaps
believed as true in fact) by Copernicus is not altogether that which
we now call by his name. It is what Bacon calls a system in which
the whole universe is one : everything is solar system with Coper-
nicus. The sun is the immoveable centre of the whole : this idea of
an immoveable centre was seldom lost sight of, except by such ultra-
heretics as Bruno. The fixed stars, instead of being distributed
through space, were placed on a sphere at the outer confines of the
creation. The laws of planetary motion not being yet discovered,
their primitive circular orbits were complicated with the subordinate
epicycles, &c. of the old or Ptolemaic system : and Copernicus does
not explicitly reject, and in some passages almost seems to favour,
the idea of the solid crystal orbs in which the planets were wheeled
round, and which Tycho Brahé dismounted by showing that comets
pass through them. Copernicus may here be held to have deferred
to learned opinion : for those who set out in physics with clear ideas
of the possible and impossible had ruled that no heavenly body could
move except with its heaven, and as a knot in the board by the
motion of the board, to use their own illustration. But, however
this may be, the reader who desires to understand this controversy,
must remember that those who spoke in favour of the Copernican
system (it was otherwise with many of the opponents) understood by
it the system taught in the book of Copernicus, upon the supposition
that the author meant what he said. Whether he did mean what
he said, or whether, on the other hand, he believed more than he
said, inay be matter for argument: but this question was never raised
in the time of which we are speaking. When. Kepler and others
wanted to show themselves believers in the actual motion of the
earth, they declared theinselves followers, not of Copernicus, but of
Philolaus or Aristarchus. When they speak of Copernicus and his
hypothesis, they soon let us see that this is from no jealousy of the

a
great mathematician, of admiring whom they are never tired, but
from the necessity of being distinctly understood.
Again, most readers will find a difficulty in remembering that the
names now unknown to them, and which sound like names of nobody,
are to be looked at as if they were names of persons known over the
whole literary world. Who is Rheinhold ? who is Ursus Dithmarsus ?
who is Patricius ? The questions asked ought to be, Who was
Rheinhold ? &c. The coupling of such names with Copernicus and
Galileo may have a strange appearance ; but we can cite something
so much more strange that we hope our reader will be reconciled to
what we have done by comparison. An excellent literary epitomist
of the last century (Stolle, 1728) says he remembers to have read
that no one could make progress in poetry, oratory, or philosophy,
without algebra. This, he says, is a good joke (egregia concludendi
ratio); as if Virgil, Ovid, Opitius, Gryphius, Hoffmannswaldavius,
Lohensteinius, Abschatzius, Neukirchius, Besserus, Brokesius, and
others of poetical fame, owed it to algebra. This proves beyond a
doubt, he says, that mathematicians* can talk absurdly as well as
philosophers.
The reader who is unaccustomed to think of scientific history may
transfer more modern views to the credit of older systems, and may
not be able to learn that names which are now unknown to general
fame are essential to a sufficient view of history; and in both these
errors he may receive some encouragement from many who ought to
know better. But there is one still greater crror which he will
actually learn from the writings of the best historians, and from the
conversation of those who are best qualified to read the histories:
namely, to judge the merit and demerit of a former age by the com-
parison of their methods with our own, instead of with the methods
of those who went before them. No one is so conspicuous a teacher
of this folly as Delambre, the greatest of astronomical historians :
but the fault is that of his time. We are in the midst (let us hope
near the culmination) of a long reaction consequent upon the long
period of excessive reverence for antiquity. The nineteenth century
will be known in history as the most uplifted of the self-glorifying
centuries : and those of a remote time, to whom the difference between
the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries will, as viewed from a dis-
tance, not seem quite so great as to us, will be amused by our crowing.
By investing Copernicus with a system which requires Galileo,
Kepler, and Newton to explain it, and their pupils to understand it,
the modern astronomer refers the want of immediate acceptance of
that system to ignorance, prejudice, and over adherence to antiquity.
No doubt all those things can be traced ; but the ignorance was of a
a
* This means that the writer lived at a period at which the new philosophy of the ma-
terial universe was busy in depreciating psychological studies. Time brings about a
reaction, and psychology and metaphysics take their innings, if we may venture such
a word; after which the other party begins again. Common sense, the diffusion of
sound thought, and the growth ot good manners, act as resistances to the swings of this
absurd pendulum, so that each is less than the one before it. In process of time, the
philosophies will know each other's value, and it will then be historically expedient
to publish "The Nursery of Knowledge, showing how the children quarrelled and

ascertained.

a
kind which belonged equally to the partisans and to the opponents,
and which fairly imposed on the propounder of the system the onus
of meeting arguments, which, in the period we speak of, he did not
and could not meet. It must be remembered that, in the sixteenth
century, the wit of man could not imagine how, if the earth moved,
a stone thrown directly upwards would tumble down upon the spot
it was thrown from. Easy experiments verify the law of motion
which now explains this; but to be proved by experiment, a law
must be conceived and imagined. To be put under discussion, it
must be proposed. Now the advocates of the earth's motion never,
before the time of Galileo, even conceived this law, never proposed
it, and of course never proved it. It might be supposed that they
would at least conjecture that progress in the mechanics of motion
would, at some future time, reconcile the beautifully simple system of
Copernicus with common sense : but no such conjecture was ventured
And for sufficient reasons. It would have been absurd to ex-
pect assent to an astronomical system, because of its clearness and
simplicity, on the faith of an assurance that opposite arguments, of an
equally clear and simple character, would at some future time be re-
futed. Any person might prove anything if he could get removal
of objections discounted. It is to be remembered that no astrono-
mical system can be a verifiable fact, like the satellites of Jupiter,
the circulation of the blood, and the efficacy of vaccination. To this
day we do not know the motion of the earth as we know either of
the things just mentioned. The evidence is inferential and cumula-
'tive : no one ever saw the earth move. Even the brilliant experi-
ment which a few years ago attracted so much attention (as well as
a beautiful variation of it just now shown at the British Association)
is one, the evidence of which not one man in ten thousand is able to
follow. Why was this experiment so eagerly welcomed ? Who
would run after any new proof, as proof, of the satellites, the circu-
lation of the blo or the good effect of vaccination ?
The matter of reproach is, that the Copernican system progressed
very slowly. But the proper question is, Did it progress as fast as
any improvement in the details of the existing system would have
done ? 'We do not think it did ; but we do not think it was much
bebind its natural pace, according to this test.
The inquirers of the sixteenth century, on the whole, took the
actual Copernican system at a fair valuation. They saw its beauty,
and they saw its difficulties. The author gained his place immedi-
ately: there never was a doubt that Copernicus was one of the
greatest of mathematicians. Even his opponents placed him by the
side of Ptolemy as a master of hypothesis. The astronomical world
was divided, so far as the physical question was concerned, into those
who would not reject the evidence of the senses, and the arguments
in which they believed, without proof that that evidence was decep-
tive; and those who attempted to answer that evidence used argu.
ments which would now be held no better than those produced on
the other side. Modern historians dwell very little on the Aristotelian
arguments which were urged on the Copernican side of the question,
even by Copernicus himself.

Those who were attached to astrology would necessarily be among
the most backward to entertain the idea of the earth's motion. It is
probably to this that we owe the not being able to cite an opinion of
Cardan either one way or the other. We cannot find that he men-
tions the name of Copernicus, though he makes some* allusion to the
dispute about the central body, quotes the Prutenic tables, and re-
cords a conversation on astrology with Rheticus in 1546.
The Copernican controversy of the sixteenth century was pas-
sionless; system, against system, hypothesis against hypothesis,
argument against argument, Philolaus against Ptolemy. It was not
until Galileo showed in the heavens, a model of the system on a
smaller scale, that those who would at any hazard preserve the
ancient opinions took real alarm. The exhibition of Jupiter and his
satellites was an argument which was not only worth much, but was
sure to for more than it was worth with the whole of the educated
community. Hence the difference between the state of the contro-
versy before and after the year 1610. The Cardinals of the Index
never prohibited the work of Copernicus until men began to read it
through Galileo's glass. Up to that time it was a question for astro-
nomers only; but after that time it was the property of the world at
large. The intention of this paper is to illustrate the distinction
between the two periods of the controversy,
The abiding interest of the later dispute has partly arisen from the
assertion of Protestant writers that the Roman Church, claiming
infallibility in matters of faith, decided the doctrine of the earth at
rest to be a truth affirmed in the Christian revelation. It has been
sufficiently shown that thist is an exaggeration (Penny Cycl. Suppl.,
“Galileo”), and that the most zealous Roman anti-Copernicans, and
even Protestants, were aware, at the time, that no decree of any
Inquisition could be held as determining a matter of faith, though it
might demand obedience of action and suppression of opinion
throughout the jurisdiction of that particular Inquisition. To the
* Foscarini cites Cardan as the author of a new system of his own; but there is
nothing in the chapter referred to which at all concerns the earth's motion, except
notice that this question is to be passed over. Cardan speaks only of sublunary
phenomena.
+ Galileo, following the example of his opponents, entered upon the question of the
interpretation of the Scriptures, and advanced or implied various canons of interpre-
tation from his private judgment. No Protestant thinks it unreasonable to affirm that,
so long as a man remains Roman Catholic, he has no business to do any such thing.
Men's minds were much stirred on this question, and some interference was inevitable,
on principles which all the disputants admitted. The Inquisition interfered, and made
a blunder. Instead of enjoining silence on all parties, as to the question of modes of
interpretation, they relied on the earth's motion being a tenet which would soon go the
way of most novelties, and pronounced it false and heretical. This was the proceeding
of 1616; that of 1633 was its necessary consequence: it is seldom permitted to govern-
ments to escape saying B when they have said A. Most of the defenders of the Papacy
have found themselves hampered by some necessity which we cannot understand of
defending the conduct of the Inquisition, as to the manner and direction of the inter-
ference. If Protestants continue to believe, much to the dissatisfaction of the old church,
that this same infallible church made a demonstrable mistake, the fault lies very
much in the manner in which Roman Catholics have argued their defence. Tiraboschi
finds it necessary to omit that the Inquisition declared the doctrine of the earth's
motion false (faisa philosophia), and only mentions the heresy. See his Memoir, Sulla
Condanna dei Galileo e del sistema Copernicano, in which he gracefully compares him-
self, when finding some fault with Galileo, to Galileo himself finding spots in the sun.
The sophism of this paper is, that the condemnation of the earth's motion is quietly
assumed to be justitied so soon as it is shown that the conduct of Galileo cannot be
fully justified.

authorities cited in that article, it may be added that even Riccioli,
from whose work all writers draw their account of the trial and
sentence of Galileo, himself one of the strongest theological oppo-
nents of the earth's motion, most expressly declares (and is allowed
by the censorship of the press to declare, as had been many who went
before him) against any declaration having been made by the Church
itself. As follows:-
“ The sacred congregation of Cardinals, taken a part from the Supreme Pontiff, does not
make propositions to be of faith, even though it should actually define them to be of
faith, or the contrary ones heretical. Wherefore, since no definition upon this matter
has as yet issued from the Supreme Pontiff, nor from any council directed and approved
by him, it is not yet of faith that the sun moves and the earth stands still, by force of
the decree of the Congregation ; but at most, and alone, by the force of the Sacred
Scripture, to those to whom it is morally evident that God has revealed it. Neverthe-
less, Catholics are bound, in prudence and obedience, at least so far as not to teach the
contrary. But of this subtility* of theology I have treated in my treatise De Fide.”
It must also be borne in mind that the Inquisition did not interfere
until both sides had got into a warm and angry dispute about certain
interpretations of the Scriptures of which both sides admitted every
interpretation to be the exclusive property of the Church. From
many circumstances we feel a right to suspect that if Galileo and his
followers had never made any other answer to the Scriptural argu-
ment except declining to assume the power which, by their own
concession, belonged only to popes and councils, they never would
have been called to account. The general temper of the higher
orders of the clergy seems to have been unobjectionable. When
Galileo applied to Maraffi, the general of the Dominicans, com-
plaining of an indecent attack made upon him by one of the order,
he received a written answer, expressing regret and the vexation of
the writer at being liable to be compromised by all the brutalities
(bestialità) which might and did take place among twenty or thirty
thousand monks. Had each offender against common sense and com-
mon modesty been a pope, a cardinal, an abbot, or a monk, acting in
his single capacity, we should have been pleased to remember how
vast and how many have been the obligations which both literature
and science have owed to those orders. And we should have
recalled the great encouragement which the Copernican system re-
ceived from popes and cardinals at its first promulgation ; nor should
we have forgotten that immediately after the first proceedings
against Galileo, a pope invited Kepler, the greatest and most noto-
а
* We have spelt this word after the Latin, that the reader may not fall into De-
lambre's error, who says, “ As if he repented of what he had just written, he adds that
this solution is only a theological subtlety.” Truly, we should like to see, even in our
day, a Roman Catholic priest apply such a phrase, in Delambre's sense, to the difference
between the decree of a general Council and of the Inquisition. If Delambre had ever,
by any accident, dipped into Occam or Duns Scotus, and found the word quidditas, he
would have said, “ The schoolman admits that his assertion is nothing but a quiddity.”
A subtlety, in the old use of the word, is a distinction which requires thought and ex-
planation: all knowledge swarms with subtleties. Nothing was more common than to
say, in answer to the Scriptural arguments, that the Scriptures do not enter into
plıysical and geometrical subtleties. Certainly Delambre would not have supposed that
his Copernican friends meant to speak scornfully of the difference between the two
systems. The word subtlety has led to some curious mistakes. At one time it was
partially disused, and, how is not explained, the word calculation took its place. Suisset
wrote, in the fourteenth century, a book which he headed “ Calculator," meaning the
maker of distinctions. The earlier historians of mathematics got hold of this title
(the work itself was scarce), represented him as a great improver of arithmetic, and
even as an inventor of algebra. An easy subtlety was much wanted here,

rious of the Copernicans next after Galileo, to be his professor of
astronomy at Bologna. But the Inquisition, the common sewer of
the odium theologicum, has no redeeming point in its general history,
though the case before us has this much of alleviation, that (taking
for granted that Galileo was not put to the torture) there is not
enough of atrocity to take off the edge of the ridicule.
What inference is to be drawn from the Church allowing this
scandal to remain for two centuries without interference, cannot be
settled until the point has been argued by both sides. But the Pro-
testants prefer to stand by their opinion that the Inquisition is the
Church ; and the Catholics are much too acute to invite the enemy
to occupy Sebastopol if the enemy prefer Odessa.
The position of the Roman Inquisition of the seventeenth century
is ridiculous enough without any exaggeration. We do not laugh at
their declaring the earth’s motion heretical, but at their declaring
it absurd and false. E pur si muove has done its work, and is doing
it still ; misrepresentation will but undo some of it. To take a hint
from Maurolycus, it would be much better to give the Inquisition a
few fathoms of stout chain cable to make the earth fast to the spot
from which Archimedes proposed to move it, than to compliment the
holy office, for party purposes, with the functions of a general council.
And it might be worth considering whether the price of the cable
should not be raised by a tax upon all who have, in a land of private
judgment, endeavoured to prevail upon public opinion to attempt
against geology what the cardinals attempted against astronomy.

II. CENSUS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1850.
In the “ Companion to the Almanac” for 1854 we gave a brief
analysis of the “ Report of the Sixth Census of Great Britain, 1851,"
then newly published. Since that volume was issued, the official
“ Report of the Seventh Census of the United States, 1850,” has
reached this country, and we now propose to set before our readers
the result of a careful examination of its contents. In thus looking
at the two Reports in connexion with each other, it is impossible to
avoid drawing comparisons, and while some that have forced them-
selves upon us are sufficiently startling, they are such as may well
afford matter for serious consideration. Let us look at one.
We showed in our review of the English Census the extraordinary
increase of the population of this country in the past half century.
But great as that was beyond any European example, its magnitude
appears less remarkable when the American is placed beside it.
The population of England and Wales had about doubled in the
fifty years from 1801 to 1851. In the same period, from 1800 to
1850, the population of the United States had quadrupled, and two
millions over--an increase that may fairly be ranked as one of the
most remarkable phenomena in the modern history of the inner life

of nations. We may compare the increase in another way. The
population of the United States in 1800 was somewhat over five
millions (5,305,925), or about equal to that of England and Wales
in 1700. England doubled this population in rather more than a
hundred years ; the United States in little more than 20 years : *
consequently the population of the United States in 1820 was about
the same as that of England and Wales in 1800. This population
was again doubled in England and Wales in 50 years ; in the United
States in 25 : the population of the United States, therefore, which
in 1800 was little more than half that of England and Wales
(5,305,900 and 8,892,000) had in 1845 reached an amount only at-
tained by England and Wales in 1851. The respective populations
at the dates of the last Censuses of the two countries were as fol.
lows :-the United States in 1850 contained 23,191,876 inhabitants;
while in 1851 Great Britain (including the Islands in the British
Seas) contained 20,959,477, or 2,232,399 less than the United States.
But when the population of Ireland (6,551,970) is added to that of
Great Britain, the population of the United Kingdom exceeds that of
the United States by nearly four millions and a half (4,319,571).
This is a statement sufficiently remarkable to make us turn with
more than common interest to the details of this rapid growth of the
North American population. Before doing so, however, we may, as
in our notice of the British Census, first look for a few moments at
the Report itself and the account it gives of the machinery of the
Census. We will at once confess that we had been anticipating its
publication for a long while with considerable curiosity. In a pre-
liminary report, dated December 1, 1851, signed by J. C. G.
Kennedy, Superintendent of Census, it was said that “the zeal and
industry of many of the officers (appointed to superintend the collec-
tion of the statistics of the several States] have contributed to furnish
materials, rich and various, illustrative of the history, geography, and
geology of the country :” and that in the full Report of this Census
it was proposed to make considerable deviations from all former
Reports; the chief deviations being,~
1 1. In the form.
“2. In accompanying the statistics of each state with a condensed
account of the most important events connected with its history from
its first settlement; exhibiting the progress of our whole social system
to the year 1850; also in presenting short accounts of each separate
county, from the date of its settlement, with the date of its organiza-
tion; an account of its physical features, its rocks, minerals, streams,
timber, water, and adaptation, naturally and artificially, to the pur-
poses of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.
" 3. In the general geological account of the state.”
Then there were to be likewise various particulars respecting
the progress of each state, a review of its character for health
and longevity, and a number of new subjects.” To the same
effect, also, we recollected, were the statements made by Mr.
Kennedy at meetings of statistical societies which he attended in
More exactly, the population of England and Wales was doubled in 110 years, that
of the United States iu 24 years.

Europe. With no little curiosity, therefore, did we hail the an-
nouncement of the arrival, in the early summer of 1854, of the long-
promised Report. The delay in its publication was readily accounted
for by a consideration of the vast range of topics which were to be
embraced in it. At length, however, it was before us; but judge
of our dismay when, on turning over the huge volume of nearly 1200
large quarto pages, we found that, with the exception of the twenty
or thirty pages of letter-press at the commencement (and these, in-
cluding the Acts of Congress, relating to the Census of 1850, and an
account of the British Census), the whole was a dense, horrific mass
of figures! Of all our promised historical, geographical, geological,
ethnological, sanitary, and endless other particulars,' not a scrap!
Looking a little closer, we found, indeed, a statement that “the as-
sistant marshals have in most cases made some general remarks upon
the topographical features of the section, its geology, healthfulness,
&c. This information,” it being coolly added, “whether valuable
or not, has not been examined or used." The Report, in a word,
we found to be confined to what is usually understood as belonging
properly to a Census return. But this great change of plan, and its
publication without any explanation, involves some considerations
which need to be looked at in order to estimate aright the character
of the Census.
The Report bears, as its author, the name of J. D. B. De Bow,
Superintendent of the United States Census; no trace remains of that
of Kennedy. The fact is, that since Mr. Kennedy's Preliminary
Report was published, a new President of the United States has been
elected, and, as the reader may be aware, a clean sweep is on such
occasions made of a large proportion of the holders of public appoint-
ments, the change extending to departments that in this country
would be regarded as wholly unconnected with parties, and the
officers consequently permanent. The system may have advantages
which the eminently-practical Americans may regard as outweighing
all the obvious evils; but the evils are obvious enough. Here, for
example, we find it stated in the opening remarks, that “on the 18th
March, 1853, an entire reorganization of the Census office took place
under the direction of the present Superintendent." This was more
than two years and a half after the Census had been taken, and, of
course, just when the persons employed to revise, classify, and tabu-
late the returns must have become thoroughly conversant with their
work, and in possession of an amount of knowledge and experience
which no new hands could possibly obtain without an enormous ex-
penditure of superfluous labour. No wonder, therefore, that we find
the Superintendent complaining of the difficulty of “obtaining, at a
short notice and for a brief period, able statistical talent in Washing-
ton. By the time,” he adds, “ an office has acquired experience, it
is abandoned,”—and able men are hardly likely for such a chance to
undergo the laborious training necessary to fit them to perform the
necessary duties in a masterly manner.
In the Report of the Census of the United States, therefore, there
must not be expected, and will certainly not be found, any such com-
prehensive grasp of the subject as is shown in that of the United

Kingdom. Nor, unfortunately, can the details be regarded with any-
thing like equal confidence. We prefer no charge against the Super-
intendent. He appears to have addressed himself earnestly to his
task, and considering that he allowed scarce three months to pass
from the reorganization of the office before he began to print the
Report, it will be readily admitted that he displayed no lack of in-
dustry. But the Report shows plainly that persons have been en-
gaged on it who are not used to dwell upon statistics with the amount
of reflection absolutely necessary to render any compilation of statistics
trustworthy. A home illustration will show what we mean. The
Report contains a great deal of extraneous matter, especially relating
to European statistics. Now, this, of course, to be of any service to
the reader in the United States, should have been taken from official
or semi-official authorities. The reporter has frequently done so, but
there is enough to show that he does not always know where to turn
for safe guidance, nor always how to use his materials. Thus he
compiles a large and curious table of the “ Population of the Principal
Cities of the World at various periods,” and he makes London to have
actually decreased in population, between 1841 and 1852, no less
than 197,140; the fact being that between 1841 and 1851, the only
periods when the population was taken, it had increased 586,181, an
error of more than three quarters of a million! For his authority he
quotes a certain Leipsic “Volk's Kalender,” though the official
Census was, of course, at hand. But if such an apparent decline in
the population of the British metropolis had not seemed strange to an
American tabulator, it may be supposed that he would know some-
thing of the progress of the cotton capital of England. Let us see.
Manchester, according to this table, had 360,000 inhabitants in 1841,
and 296,000 in 1852, being a decline of 64,000 in 11 years ; while
the true numbers were including Salford) 311,269 in 1841, and
401,321 in 1851, or an increase of 90,052-showing an error in the
American table of above 150,000. Bristol, again, has the population
given in 1841 (inaccurately), in 1851 (correctly), and again in 1852,
at above 22,000 less than 1851. These and many other mistakes,
equally palpable and ludicrous, are given without any remark of any
kind, although the very contiguity of the figures, one would think,
could not have failed to suggest the reflection that there must be
something rotten in the state of England, if its chief towns were losing
their inhabitants in this extraordinary manner, and have led to an
examination into its reality. In the accounts of the relative popula-
tion of the European kingdoms, like errors abound. Of course, there
is not the remotest suspicion of their being any intention to deceive,
but we must say that such things show either singular inaptitude or
want of experience in the compiler, and render it needful to read the
Report with much caution where it treats of less familiar matters.
And while there is evident on the face of the Report the absence
of the thoroughly trained intellect, there are no less manifest, when
the arrangements and machinery of the Census are considered, cir-
cumstances which go far to remove from the particulars all preten-
sion to the precision which has been so carefully aimed at, and to a
great extent attained in the British Census. Much of this, indeed,

is very fairly admitted in the Report : “ The present census system
of the United States is in many respects defective. ... The per-
sons selected as enumerators are often proved by the returns to be
entirely incompetent, for which, perhaps, the low rate of compensa-
tion, or [? and] the mode of appointment, may be assigned as reasons.
The districts embraced by each enumerator are too large; if practi-
cable, for accuracy they should be as small as those of Great Britain.
In this case, the permanent state and county officers ought to form a
part of the machinery.” We should not lose sight of a most fertile
source of inaccuracy. In taking the British Census, the proper
officer leaves at each house in his district, during the previous week
a schedule, to be filled up by the householder on the morning of enu-
meration; and this schedule is called for on the day of enumeration,
and its correctness as far as possible verified. In the United States,
the schedules are directed to be filled up 66 with reference to
particular day, but the officer does not call with the schedule for
days-perhaps weeks or even months after the day specified.
The duty of taking the Census in all the different enumerations,
was entrusted to the marshals of the United States, and to assistants
appointed under them. The number of marshals so employed was
45; of assistants 3,231; a staff, of course, utterly inadequate for
anything approaching a simultaneous enumeration of the population
of so vast a country. For the enumeration of the population in 1851,
England and Wales were divided into 624 registration districts, each
having a superintendent-registrar; these were divided into 2,190 sub-
districts, each having a local registrar; and these again into 30,610
enumeration districts, each of which was assigned to an enumerator
who was required to complete his enumeration in one day. So that
for enumerating the population of England and Wales, a territory of
58,320 square miles, no less than 33,424 persons were employed,
while for the same purpose in the United States, with an area of
3,300,000 square miles, only 3,276 persons were employed.
We turn to the results of the Census. Stated broadly, the
Seventh Census of the United States, showed that on the 1st of June,
1850, the republic consisted of thirty-one states, and five territories,
occupying an area of 3,306,865 square miles, and containing a total
population of 23,191,876 persons. The first census was taken in
1790, when there were 17 states and territorial governments included
in the Union, with a total population of 3,929,827. In 1800, there
were 21 states and territories ; in 1810, 25 states and territories; in
1820, 27 states and territories ; in 1830, 28 states and territories ;
in 1840, 30 states and territories; and in 1850 (as said above), 36
states and territories. These few figures show in a striking manner,
not only the rapid, but the continuous advance of the republic in
extent, as well as in population.
The republic of the United States, in the words of Mr. Kennedy's
Preliminary Report, has gained during the ten years, from 1840 to
1850,“ by annexation, conquest, and purchase, 833,970 square miles,"
an increase of area, nearly equal to the area of the whole of the
United Kingdom, with its European settlements, France, Austria,
Prussia, and Spain—the area of which together amounts to 874,791
a

square miles; while the addition gained by admission of title in the
treaty with Great Britain exceeds the area of Turkey in Europe,
Denmark, Portugal, Bavaria, and Belgium. The addition to the popu-
lation of the United States, between 1840 and 1850 (6,122,423), would
form two nations, very nearly equal in population to the kingdoms of
Portugal and Denmark, whose inhabitants together number 6,179,518.
We may follow out and illustrate the remarkable increase of the
Union, by a few comparisons confined principally to its own boun-
daries. We
ave seen that the population of the United States has
multiplied nearly sixfold between the first Census in 1790 and the
seventh Census in 1850; that in the half century, 1800-1850, it
has quadrupled, and two millions over; and that on comparing the
Census Returns of 1830 and 1850, the population appears to be
doubling in 25 years. Looking, however, at the last ten years only
(1840-1850) we see that it would require nearly 28 years (27 years
10 months), to double the population at its then rate of increase;
so that as it doubled in 24 years from 1800 to 1820; in 25 years from
1820 to 1845; and is now doubling in 28 years; there appears to be
a slow but steady decline in the rate of increase of the population of
the United States.
But further, this population is made up of three classes, Whites,
Free Coloured persons, and Slaves, and the rate of their increase is
very different. The white population is doubling itself in 25 years.
The free coloured population would require very nearly 56 years.
The slaves rather less than 37 years (36 years 10 months). These
are the results of a comparison of the population in 1830 and 1850;
but if only the last ten years be taken, it will be found that while
the whites will require 267 years to double their numbers, the free
coloured will require just over 80 years; the slaves 44 years and
8 months. The extraordinary rapidity of increase is therefore
mainly due to the white population, and much of that must be attri-
buted to the stimulus imparted by the rapid increase of territory, and
the enormous addition by immigrants from Europe. And how
great this addition has been is seen at once by the statement, that
while the total increase of the white population between 1840 and
1850 was under five millions and a half (5,357,373), the number of
foreigners who between those years arrived in the United States
exceeded one inillion and a half (1,542,850). Allowing that the
deaths are greater among the newly-arrived foreign than the native
population (although probably the births are relatively greater also),
it would not be too much to say, that the native white population
had only increased four millions between 1840 and 1850, at which
rate it would require above 35 years to double its numbers. In
other words, no slaves being permitted to be brought into the
United States, the actual increase of the native white population is
not very much more rapid than that of the slave; the one requiring,
in order to double its numbers, 35 years, and the other 44 years.
The actual increase of the slaves would indeed approach nearer that
of the native white population, but for various disturbing causes.
Thus, in 1850, about 3,000 persons ceased to be slaves ; 1,467
having been manumitted, 1,011 having escaped from their masters, and

562 (who are described as coloured emigrants, and were probably in
part from the class of free coloured persons), having been sent by the
Colonization Society to Liberia ; and like processes were going on in
the preceding years, though we have no similar statement of numbers.
The numbers of the several classes at the respective censuses are
shown in the following Table :-

At the end of this article we have given a table of the area,
inhabitants (distinguishing the classes), and density of the population
of the states and territories, arranged in alphabetical order.
The ratio of increase per cent of the States during the ten years
1840-50 was :-New-England States, 22:7; Middle States, 29:44:
Southern States, 1858 ; South-Western States, 47.89; North-
Western States, 54:43. The great increase consequently being in
the Western States. The greatest increase in individual States was
in Wisconsin, which increased from 30,945 to 305,391 inhabitants,
or 886-88 per cent in the ten years; in other words, it multiplied its
population nearly tenfold! Iowa, which increased from 43,112 to
192,214, or 345.85 per cent.; and Arkansas, which increased from
97,574 to 209,897, or 115.12 per cent. All the other States in-
creased, and most of them largely, but only these three doubled
their numbers in the ten years. The least increase was in Vermont,
which rose from 291,948 to 314,129, or only at the rate of 7.59 per
cent. in the ten years: the next lowest were New Hampshire, which
increased 11.73; and South Carolina, which increased 12:47 per cent.
The State which has, however, most declined in relative rank during
the last 60 years is Connecticut, which, in 1790, was eighth in
regard to population, and in 1850 was only twenty-first. The State
which most gained in relative rank is Ohio, which was first reckoned
as a State in the Census of 1800, when it ranked only seventeenth in
population, while in 1850 it had risen to be third, though in area
it only ranked as twenty-third. The first place in regard to popu-
lation is taken by New York, which in 1790 was fifth.
In the Report are tables which give specifically the places of birth
of the inhabitants of all the States;- but they were drawn up before
the Census office was placed under its present management, and it is
pointed out that “time has not admitted of their re-examination,"
while, " in many particulars, they do not agree with other published
results.” They are to be received with some caution, therefore; but
a few of the broader features may be given, as they are of considerable
interest, and it is not likely that there is any important error. Out
of the 19,553,068 white inhabitants of the United States in 1850,
13,103,650 were born in the State in which they were resident at

Census of the United States, 1850,
the taking of the Census ; 4,176,225 were born in other States ;
2,240,535 were born in foreign countries; and of 32,658, the place of
birth was unknown. These figures show that, of the native popula-
tion (i. e., persons born in the United States), nearly one-third reside
in a different State to that in which they were born. The returns of
places of birth in the several States afford note-worthy evidence of
the westward march of this native migration. If we look at two
of the largest States—Pennsylvania and Ohio— we shall find this
brought out strongly. Pennsylvania has a native population of
2,014,619, of whom only 165,690 were born in other States; while
Ohio, with 1,757,556 native inhabitants
, has 529,208, who were born
in other States. Of these native immigrants Pennsylvania received
the largest number from New York, 58,835; and New Jersey,
29,117; and only 7,729 from Ohio: while Ohio received the largest
number from Pennsylvania, 200,634 ; Virginia, 85,762, New York,
83,979; and Maryland, 36,698. At the same time we find the
natives of Ohio in their turn going still further west: thus there are
120,193 natives of Ohio in Indiana, 64,291 in Illinois, 30,713 in Iowa,
12,737 in Missouri, 14,677 in Michigan, and 11,402 in Wisconsin;
while in Pennsylvania, to which the eastward-moving natives of Ohio
chiefly wend their way, there are only 7,720. In all, 311,395 persons
born in Ohio-or more than 1 in 5 of all born in the State-were
resident in other States at the taking of the Census. Much has been
said of the propensity of the American people to seek new homes,
but few things we venture to think can be found to show this pro-
pensity in a more striking light than the fact that Ohio, the wealthiest
and most prosperous of the new States, and one to which not only
such numbers of foreign immigrants yearly flock as to a land of
promise, but one-third of the native population is derived from other
States, so large a proportion as one-fifth of the persons born in the
States should be found seeking their fortune in other, and for the
most part newer, States. The westward movement of the native
population may be further illustrated by two or three more hasty
comparisons. Thus while Connecticut has of the native population
284,978 born in the State, and only 39,117 born in other States,
Illinois has but 331,089 born in the State to 399,733 born in other
States, and Indiana has, to 520,583 born in the State, 398,695 born in
other States. In Kentucky, on the other hand, to 813,891 born in
the State, there are only 57,502 born in other States, illustrating with
the figures quoted above that it is to the Free States that the native
as well as the foreign migration is principally directed. In the
newest States, of course, the majority of the population is from other
States : thus in Wisconsin, out of 197,912 native inhabitants, only
54,312 were born in the State ; in Iowa, 41,305 out of 170,620; in
Texas, 43,281 out of 137,053 ; and in California, 7,696 out of 69,610.
In Texas the immigrants are chiefly from the Slave-holding, in
California from the Free States.
The addition made to the population of the United States by emi-
gration from foreign countries is, to an Englishman, one of the most
interesting features of the Census. Mr. Kennedy says that the
European emigration alone fully accounts for the great increase of

a
population during the ten years. As we have seen, the number of
foreigners in the United States in 1850 was nearly two millions and
a quarter; but Mr. Kennedy estimates the total number of European
immigrants and their descendants at nearly four millions and a half
(4,350,934). The actual number of foreign passengers who arrived
at the different ports of the United States, during the ten years 1840-
1850, was upwards of a million and a half. The numbers, as will be
seen, have rapidly increased since 1846 :

Since 1850 the arrivals have averaged above 400,000 a-year. The
immigration of so large a number of foreigners-by far the greater
portion of whom are in the vigour of life-must evidently tend to con-
siderably modify the American character, and from the easy terms
of citizenship, exert an influence upon its institutions; and it becomes
an easy matter for oue accustomed to strikes against non-society
workmen to understand the rise and spread of such societies as the
“ Native Know-nothings.” Of the two millions and a quarter of
foreigners resident in the States in 1850 considerably over one-half
(1,340,812) were natives of the United Kingdom; of these, 961,719
were from Ireland, 278,675 from England, 70,550 from Scotland,
and 29,868 from Wales. Next in number were natives of Germany,
573,225; France, 54,069 ; Switzerland, 13,358; Norway, 12,678;
Prussia, 10,549; Holland, 9,848 ; Italy, 3,645 ; Sweden, 3,559 ;
Denmark, 1,838 ; Russia, 1,414; Belgium, 1,313; Portugal, 1,274;
Austria, 946; Turkey, 106; Greece, 86; and Sardinia, 34. British
America contributed no fewer than 147,711 ; the West Indies,
5,772; and Mexico, 13,317. Asia is put down for 377 ; Africa for
551; while China figures for 758 (of whom 660 were in California);
and the Sandwich Islands for 5,772.
The European immigrants are, for the most part, settled in the
Free States. The chief are in the Atlantic States, but large numbers
have gone to the Western States. New York contains the largest
number, 651,801, of foreigners ; next are Pennsylvania, 294,871;
Ohio, 218,512 ; Massachusetts, 160,909; Illinois, 110,593; Wis-
consin, 106,695 ; Missouri, 72,474; Louisiana, 66,413; New Jersey,
58,364 ; Michigan, 54,852 ; Indiana, 54,426 ; Maryland, 253,288;
Arkansas has the fewest, 1,628.
Of the English 84,820 are in New York; 38,048 in Pennsylvania;
25,660 in Ohio ; 18,952 in Wisconsin ; 18,628 in Illinois ; 16,685
in Massachusetts ; 11,377 in New Jersey ; 10,620 in Michigan; and
in smaller numbers in every other State, Arkansas having fewest,
196. In California there were 3,050, and in Utah, the Mormon ter-
ritory, 1,056. The Irish (who are mostly found in the larger towns)

Wisconsin ; 19,557 in Maryland ; and in lesser numbers in every
other State, the fewest, 514, being in Arkansas. Scots are also most
numerous in New York, where they number 23,418; in Pennsylvania,
7,292 ; in Ohio, 5,232; in Massachusetts, 4,469; in Wisconsin,
3,527; and so on through all the States, the smallest number (71) being,
as with the others, in Arkansas. The Welsh are most numerous in
Pennsylvania, 8,920 ; in New York, 7,582; in Ohio, 5,849; and in
Wisconsin, 4,319: none of the other States contain 1,000 Welsh-
men ; North Carolina, which has the fewest, contains only 11.
Among the German immigrants a larger proportion than among
our countrymen practise agriculture, but New York still contains the
greatest number, 118,398 ; Ohio, however, has nearly as many,
111,257 ; the other States in which they are most numerous are
Pennsylvania, 78,592; Missouri, 44,352; Illinois, 38,160; Wis-
consin, 34,519; Indiana, 28,584; Maryland, 26,936, Louisiana,
17,507 ; New Jersey, 10,686 ; and there are some in all the other
States, the fewest, 147, being in New Hampshire. Of the French
the largest number are in New York, 12,515; Louisiana, 11,552;
Ohio, 7,375; and Pennsylvania, 4,083 ; the fewest are in Vermont,
40, and North Carolina, 43. The Swiss are distributed through all
the States, the largest number being in Ohio, 3,291 ; and New York,
1,850; and the smallest in Vermont, 2; and North Carolina, 3. The
Norwegians have full five-sixths of their number in Wisconsin, 8,651,
and Illinois, 2,415, The Prussians are somewhat more generally
distributed, but 3,545 of them are in Wisconsin, and 2,211 in New
York. The Dutch are most numerous in New York, 2,917; and
Ohio, 2,542. The Italians are most numerous in Louisiana, 915 ;
and New York, 833.
The number of free coloured persons in the United States in 1850
was 434,495. As we have seen, they increase in numbers at a pro-
gressively slower rate. Their rapid increase in the early years of the
republic has been, no doubt, correctly attributed to the general desire
then felt, especially in the new Free States, to emancipate the slaves;
and much of the slower rate of increase in later years, to manumission
having necessarily ceased, with the cessation of slavery in the Free
States, while in the Slave States slavery has come to be more and more
cherished as a vital institution. But, further, the increase is also
attributable in no small measure to the social degradation of the black
race-a degradation felt not least strongly in the Northern and
Western States—the very laws, and in some instances, even the
constitution carrying out the public feeling :-as in Indiana and
Illinois, where, though slavery is prohibited, there are clauses in the
constitution of each State which make it an offence punishable with
fine and imprisonment for any “free person of colour to come into the
State and settle ;" all contracts with such persons are absolutely
and any persons employing such render themselves liable to a
heavy penalty-the fines to be appropriated to the colonization of the
coloured persons already in the State who may be willing to emigrate.
When such is the tone of public opinion towards a class, its compara-
tively slow progress in some States, or its actual decline in others,
will not appear surprising. In Mississippi, the free coloured popu-

lation decreased from 1,366 to 930, or 31:91 per cent., between 1840
and 1850; in Louisiana, from 25,502 to 17,462, or 31:52 per cent.
In some of the Western States, however, though the numbers of this
class are small, their rate of increase has been very large, as in Wis-
consin, 243.24 per cent., or from 185 to 635; and Iowa, 93.6 per
cent., or from 172 to 333. The free coloured persons are most
numerous in Maryland, where they increased from 62,078 in 1840 to
74,723 in 1850 ; in Virginia, where they numbered 54,333 in 1850;
in Pennsylvania, 53,626; and in New York, 49,069.
The number of slaves in the United States in 1850 was 3,204,313.
The Slave States (enumerated according to the number of slaves which
they possess—from Virginia, which has nearly half a million to De-
laware, which has only 2,290, New Jersey has 236 returned as slaves,
but they are really apprentices' under the State Act for Abolishing
Slavery, of April 1846)--are Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ken-
tucky, Maryland, Missouri, Texas, Arkansas, Florida, district of
Columbia, and Delaware. The rate of increase of the slave popula-
tion has been, on the whole, pretty equal during the decennial
periods : it is about 9 per cent. less than that of the whites. The
proportion to whites has diminished about 3 per cent. since the first
Census; the proportion having been in 1790-whites, 80-73; slaves,
17.76; and free coloured, 1.51; and in 1850—whites, 84:31 ; slaves,
13.82; and free coloured, 1.87. In only two states do the slaves ex-
ceed the free population, namely, in South Carolina, where the
slaves are 387,984, and the total free only 283,523 ; and Mississippi,
where there are 309,858 slaves, and 296,678 free.
According to the principle laid down in the Act of Congress, the
number of representatives which each State sends to Congress
depends upon the amount of population at the last census. The
aggregate representative population is ascertained by adding to the
whole number of free persons in all the States three-fifths of the
number of slaves, and dividing the aggregate by 233 (the number
of members of Congress), “and the product of such division, reject-
ing any fraction, is to be the ratio or rule of apportionment of
representatives among the several States under such enumeration.”
The Census of 1850, under this rule of apportionment, gave
21,767,673 as the aggregate representative population, and (this
being divided by 233) 93,423 as the rule of apportionment among
the States—the residue being left to be assigned to the States
having the largest residuary fractions. Thus New York, having a
representative population of 3,097,394, has (at the rate of one
member to every 93,423) 33 representatives in Congress ; Pennsyl-
vania (representative population 2,311,786) has 25 representatives,
and so on, California having by special act an additional member :
we have added the number of representatives of each_State to the
table at the end. This apportionment gives to the Free States a
representative population of 13,436,931, and, consequently, 143
representatives in Congress, and to the Slave States a representative
population of 8,330,742, and 90 representatives in Congress. In
Congress, therefore, the Slave States have a decided minority of

seres.
members. But the representation in the Senate is apportioned on
an entirely different principle. To the Senate every State, without
distinction, sends two members. Now, as there are thirty-one States,
and fifteen of them are Slave States, and as every measure must pass
both houses, it will be at once evident why the admission of every
new State or territory becomes a battle-field between the advocates
and opponents of slavery. In all questions respecting “ the institution,”
the representatives of the Slave States act as one man, and as equal
unanimity can bardly be looked for among the representatives of
the other States, a majority in the Senate may be reckoned as secure.
To overturn this practical majority, by preventing, if possible, the
admission of a new State as å slave-holding one, is, therefore, the
earnest endeavour of one party, while the other as strenuously
supports the opposite course.
One of the points of difference between the population of the
United States and that of Great Britain is in the proportion of the
In Great Britain there was, at each Census during the past
half-century, a greater number of females than males ; the numbers
being, in 1851, 10,735,919 females to 10,386,048 males, or 103,369
females to 100,000 males-i. c., somewhat less than 30 males to 31
females. In the United States, on the contrary, one of the most
striking facts in the classification of sexes, &c., is the excess of
males in the white, and of females in the free coloured population.
In 1850, there were among the white population, 10,026,402 males
to 9,526,666 females, or, as 100 to 95. İn the free coloured popu-
lation there were only 208,724 males to 225,771 females, or 100 to
to 108. Among the slaves the males and females were almost
exactly equal, there being 1,602,535 males to 1,601,778 females, or
100 to 99.9.
The number of families was “ 3,598,240 for the free population,
to which should be added for the slaves not taken, at least 599,674,
swelling the aggregate of families to 4,197,914. .. The total number
of dwellings of the free inhabitants of the United States is shown to
be 3,362,337, and there can be no hesitation in admitting the figures
to be correct, as the marshals numbered from door to door. If to
these be added, for purposes of comparison with European nations,
the houses of the negroes--on the average quite as good as those of
the peasants and operatives generally in Europe, and better than
those in Ireland-one house for every six slaves, the total number of
houses will be 3,896,385. . . The number of houses of every kind,
in use for other purposes than dwellings, is not ascertained, but
from the nature of the country, must be immensely greater than is
found anywhere else.” No return is made of the number of occupied
and unoccupied dwellings, but it is stated that “ For the free popula-
tion, fourteen out of every fifteen of all the dwellings in the United
States are occupied, each, on the average, by a single family, leaving
235,903 families, or the other fifteenth, occupying houses with
others, &c. By comparison with European countries, this will
appear to be a favourable state of things." It may be so; but a
vague estimate of this kind is hardly enough to establish
any
such
comparison, and it does not carry a very trustworthy aspect,

With regard to cities, towns, and villages, no information is
given in the Report beyond that contained in one or two imperfect
tables. It is said, indeed, in the “ Remarks upon the Schedules,”
that “ It is to be regretted that instructions were not given to
separate minutely upon the schedules every village, town, or urban
aggregation whatever, as the information thus obtained would have
been very valuable. This ought to be done hereafter. In the
present work many towns of importance are mixed up with the
counties, and could not be separated. The smaller towls in the
South are generally neglected in this way by the enumerators." At
the end of the Report is given an extremely long alphabetical list of
“ Places,” and to some few of them are attached a T. for town, or
B. for borough. But the great bulk are without any distinguishing
mark, and the long succession of similar names is utterly bewilder-
ing. Thus there follow each other a list of no less than 163
places” named Washington, 136 Jacksons, 90 Jeffersons, 101
Franklins, and 72 Monroes, 121 named Union, 66 Libertys, two
dozen Concords, and half a hundred Centres. Even less interesting
names find almost as many local habitations : thus, there are no less
than 67 Perrys, of which 26 are in Ohio (having populations varying
from 262 to 4,667); 22 Browns, 10 Jones, and at least half a dozen
Robinsons ; while, even in 1850, Kossuth had his name to a couple
of places, at present he has nearly a score, and Jenny Lind half a
dozen. At the end of this paper will be found a table of all the
cities and towns in the Union, which have 20,000 inhabitants, with
their population in 1840 and 1850.
Tables are given of Births, Marriages, and Deaths, but they are
admitted to be of very little value, and it would, therefore, be idle
to quote them. The same may be said of the Tables of the Deaf,
Dumb, and Insane. The Religious and Educational Statistics are
more valuable, though, as must in fairness be expected, very imper-
fect. The Report states, that " The Church Statistics are as com-
plete as they can be ascertained from the schedules of the marshals.
It will be observed that they do not undertake to give, as they are
often quoted to do, the number of members of each religious denomi-
nation, or even the number of attendants upon churches. Nothing
in this respect is given but the capacity of the buildings to accommo-
date.” In many places the same building is used by different sects.
Of course this presents a difficulty in knowing to whom to appro-
priate the building and its accommodation. The knot, too hard,
perhaps, to untie, has been rather roughly cut. " Wherever several
sects are reported as worshippers in the same building, its accom-
modations, &c., are divided between them in the table. This,
though objectionable in itself, seemed to be less so than any other
method which could conveniently be adopted.” But in this case to
which sect does the building go? or does it reckon as one to each,
and so, perhaps, count as half a dozen ? Then if the building counts
for more than it ought, the accommodation plainly reckons for less.
Twenty-one sects are named; and there is a heading of “ Minor
Sects,” which, we are told, includes " such sects in each of the
States as were so few in number as not to be deemed entitled to

special notice.” The sects enumerated (and arranged according to
the number of churches) are as follows:-Methodists (there is no
distinction of Wesleyan, Primitive, &c.) 13,280 churches, affording
accommodation for 4,343,579 persons. They appear to be most
numerous in Ohio, where they have 1,529 churches, affording
accommodation for 543,090 ; in New York 1,231 churches, and
accommodation for 481,270 ; and Virginia 1,025 churches, with
accommodation for 323,708. Baptists, 9,375 churches, with accom-
modation for 3,247,029. They appear to be most numerous in the
Slave States ; in Georgia, they have 879 churches, with accommoda-
tion for 319,293; in Kentucky, 803, with accommodation for
291,855; in Virginia, 649, with accommodation for 247,589; and
in Tennessee, 646 churches, with accommodation for 195,315.
Presbyterians, 4,824 churches, with accommodation for 2,079,690.
They are most numerous in Pennsylvania, where they have 775
churches, with accommodation for 359,966 ; in New York, 671
churches, with accommodation for 373,264; and in Ohio, 663
churches, with accommodation for 272,274; in Rhode Island they
have no church. Congregationalists, 1,706 churches, with accom-
-modation for 801,835. The largest number of churches is in
Massachusetts, 448, with accommodation for 239,142 ; Connecticut,
252 churches, with accommodation for 127,320 ; and New York,
215 churches, with accommodation for 102,430; no less than 16 of
the States (including Pennsylvania, and nearly all the Slave States)
are returned as having no churches of this denomination. Episcopa-
lians, 1,459 churches, with accommodation for 643,598. There are
Episcopal Churches in all the States, but they are most numerous in
New York, 279, with accommodation for 140,195 ; Virginia, 173,
with accommodation for 79,684; Pennsylvania, 136, with accommo-
dation for 67,574; and Maryland, 133, with accommodation for
60,105. Roman Catholics, 1,221 churches, with accommodation
for 667,823. There are also Roman Catholic Churches in all the
States, but they are most numerous in New York, where there are
176, with accommodation for 126,288 ; in Pennsylvania, 139, with
accommodation for 89,251 ; and Ohio, 130, with accommodation for
76,215. The (German) Lutherans have 1,217 churches, with ac-
commodation for 534,250; of which 498, with accommodation for
261,502, are in Pennsylvania, and 260, with accommodation for
90,448, in Ohio. The Christians' have 853 churches, with accom-
modation for 300,005. Friends (Quakers), 726 churches, with
accommodation for 286,323. Unionists, 608 churches, with accom-
modatian for 202,624. Universalists, 529 churches, with accom-
modation for 214,115. Free, 386 churches, with accommodation
for 114,780. German Reformed, 338 churches, with accommoda-
tion for 158,932; of which 209 are in Pennsylvania. Dutch
Reformed, 330 churches, with accommodation for 180,636, of which
233 churches, accommodating 131,025, are in New York. Moravians,
328 churches (of which, 160 are in Ohio), with accommodation for
109,257. Unitarians, 242 churches, with accommodation for

tion for 29,160'; of which 92 are in Pennsylvania. Tunkers, 51
churches, with accommodation for 22,325. Jews, 30 synagogues,
with accommodation for 15,175. Swedenborgians, 16 churches,
with accommodation for 5,170. Orthodox Congregationalists, 9
churches, all in Pennsylvania, with accommodation for 3,100. Minor
Sects, 409 churches, with accommodation for 133,802.
The suminary result of the inquiry, with respect to churches and
church accommodation, is that there are in the United States 38,061
churches affording accommodation for 14,234,825 persons, being
about equal to 61 per cent. of the entire population. This is much
larger than the proportion (about 57 per cent.) shown to exist in
England and Wales by the Census of 1851. With respect to the
distribution of the accommodation among the several sects, it will
not have escaped the reader's notice how large a proportion, consider-
ably more than half, falls to the share of the Methodists and Bap-
tists. If to these be added the Presbyterians, less than one-third of the
entire accommodation will be found to belong to the other eighteen
principal, and all the minor sects. There is a heading “Value
of Church Property in the United States," which in nowise con-
cerns us, except as it may serve as a slight indication of the relative
position in society of the members of the several sects. The total
value of church property is returned at 87,328,801 dollars. Of
this 14,822,870 dollars belong to the Methodists, while the Presby-
terians, who possess less than half the church accommodation, own a
nearly equal share of church property (14,543,789 dollars). Again,
the Baptists, the next most numerous sect to the Methodists, possess
church property to the value of 11,020,855 dollars, while the Epis-
copalians (with only one-fifth the church accommodation) possess
church property value 11,375,010 dollars. In the enumeration of
sects, one omission will have been noticed : there is no mention of
Mormonites. The word does not, in fact, occur in the Report. But
under Utah, the Mormon territory, we are told," the marshal re-
turns nine churches, without giving the denominations, with 4,200
accommodations, and 51,000 dollars value."
The education of the children of the free population of the United
States has always received a large share of attention from both the
General and States' Legislatures, and very considerable sums have
been set apart for educational purposes. The educational statistics
obtained in the Census of 1850 are, however, far from being either
complete or satisfactory. It is certainly sufficiently unsatisfactory to
be furnished with tables of results of the inquiries on this very im-
portant subject, and to be told, three years and a half having elapsed
between the day of enumeration and the date of the Report, that
“time has not admitted of such criticisms as are absolutely necessary
to prevent erroneous conclusions, and to present the subject correctly
if anything is to be published upon it at all.'
While, therefore, it hardly appears worth while to quote at any
length the educational statistics which are confessedly likely in their
present state 6 to lead only to erroneous conclusions," we will give
the broad results, leaving the reader to take them for what they are
worth, just adding one other word of elucidation or caution (as the

reader pleases to regard it) from the Appendix. " In several of the
States there seems to be no general public school system, some par-
ticular counties supporting public or free schools by taxes levied
within their own limits. The different modes in the several States
involve so much cónfusion in the returns, that any accurate distribu-
tion of them, as to public or private, has been found impracticable.
The plan adopted has been to arrange those schools, showing taxa-
tion as a source of income (with some exceptions as to academies) in
the table of public schools.”
The total number of white children in the United States in 1850,
between 5 and 15 years of age, was 2,598,013 males and 2,508,144
females ; between 1 and 5 years, there were 1,198,746 males and
1,160,051 females. The total number of free coloured children, be-
tween 5 and 10 years of age, was 54,867 males and 55,493 females ;
betwen 1 and 5 years, 24,743 males and 24,902 females. The total
number of white children attending school during the year, as
turned in the schedule of population,” was 2,146,432 males and
1,916,614 females ; total 4,063,046. Of free coloured children,
13,864 males and 12,597 females; total 26,461. Of these 4,089,507
children attending school in 1850, there was 3,942,081 native born,
and 147,426 foreign. The education returns made up by the
marshals, as mentioned above, give somewhat different figures, show-
ing as the aggregate 80,991 public schools, having 92,000 teachers
and 3,354,173 pupils, which if the pupils in all other schools be
added, will be swelled only to 3,642,694: a discrepancy which the
Census authorities acknowledge themselves unable to explain, and
which we of course have no means of elucidating. These 80,991 public
schools have a total income of 9,591,530 dollars, of which 182,595
are derived from endowment, 4,686,414 from taxation, 2,574,669
from public funds, and 2,147,853 from “ other sources.” Of colleges,
there are 234 with 1,651 teachers, 27,159 pupils; and a total income
of 1,916,628 dollars, of which 452,314 dollars are from endowment,
15,485 from taxation, 184,549 public funds, and 1,264,280 from
other sources. Of academies and other schools there are 6,032 with
12,207 teachers, and 261,362 pupils; and a total income of 4,653,842
dollars, of which 288,855 dollars are from endowment, 14,202 from
taxation, 114,798 from public funds, and 4,235,987 from other
The return of colleges being admittedly inaccurate, it may be in-
teresting to place alongside it a statement of the number of colleges
from a list given in the “ American Almanac for 1854”-a publication
which contains a great body of valuable statistical information relating
to the United States, collected with judgment and care. To obtain
this particular information, “ circulars were sent to each college, and
from most of them returns were received of their condition, January
1, 1853.” The total number of " colleges and professional schools'
on that day was 119, having 1,006 instructors and 11,730 students ;
37 medical schools having 255 instructors and 5,038 students ; 44
theological institutions, having 129 instructors and 1,351 students;
and 16 law schools, having 35 instructors and 482 students.

who cannot read and write,” 962,898 whites (389,664 males and
573,234 females), or 4:4 per cent of the entire white population ; and
90,522 free coloured (40,722 males and 49,800 females), or 20-8 per
per cent.: in all, 1,053,420, or 5-2 per cent. of the free population.
Of these, 858,306 were native born, and 195,114 foreign. This
table, of which the above are the results, the Report says, “is no
doubt reliable, so far as the whites are concerned-at least as reliable
as any similar table published in previous years."
In the education returns it will be seen that slaves are not noticed.
School instruction is not permitted to their children. They are re-
garded as labouring animals, and their education is conformable :-
they are taught how to do their work.
The subject of education may be very properly followed by that
of public libraries, which are happily extremely numerous in the
United States, and the statistics of which appear to have been care-
fully collected and tabulated. The total number of “ libraries other
than private” in the States (California and the territories were not
returned) was 15,615, containing 4,636,411 volumes. Of these
1,217, containing 1,446,015 volumes, were public; 12,067, with
1,647,404 volumes, were school ; 1,988, with 542,321 volumes, were
Sunday-school ; 213, with 942,321 volumes, were college; and 130,
with 58,350 volumes, were church libraries. Of the public libraries
Michigan had the largest number, 280, with 65,116 volumes ; but
several other States had more volumes-Massachusetts having 177
libraries, with 257,737 volumes; New York 43 libraries, with
197,229 volumes ; Pennsylvania 90 libraries, with 184,666 volumes ;
South Carolina 16 libraries, with 73,758 volumes; the district of
Columbia 7, with 66,100 volumes, and Ohio 65, with 65,703
volumes. The worst-furnished State was Arkansas, which had only
one public library, with 250 volumes, and two Sunday-school libraries
of 170 volumes : in all 420 volumes. A second and more elaborate
table, prepared in 1851 by the Smithsonian Institution, gives some-
what lower aggregate results, but the Census returns are probably
most accurate ; the brief notes, however, which were prepared by
Professor Jewett to accompany the Smithsonian table, furnish such
valuable information respecting the public libraries of the States that
we cannot refrain from giving a few extracts. He says,
several classes of public libraries in each State may be characterized
in general terms as follows:-
1. State Libraries, including those of the general government, and
of the executive departments, and those of the State courts. Almost
all the States in the Union have organised State libraries ; those
which have not, possess collections of books which will, ere long,
serve as the foundations of such libraries. These libraries are com-
posed, to a great extent, of public documents of the General and State
governments, with works on statistics, political economy, history, &c.
Some of them, as the Library of Congress, the New York State
Library, &e., take a much wider range, and are extremely valuable
collections for general reference.
2. Social Libraries, including athenæums, lyceums, young men's
associations, mechanics' institutions, mercantile libraries, &c. These
66 The

libraries are generally composed of popular works for reading rather
than for reference; but among them are many of the best collections
in the country. . . In some States almost every town has, under some
name, a social library... (The Smithsonian table shows an aggregate
of 126 of these social libraries, containing 611,334 volumes.)
3. College Libraries (exclusive of students' libraries). -Our col.
leges are mostly eleemosynary institutions. Their libraries are
frequently the chance aggregation of the gifts of charity-too many
-of them discarded as , well-nigh worthless from the shelves of the
donors. This is not true of all our college libraries, for among them
are some very important collections, chosen with care and com-
petent learning.
4. Students' Libraries, in colleges, professional schools, academies,
&c. ... These are generally useful collections of books of a popular
character..
5. Libraries of Professional Schools and Incorporated Acade-
mies.-This class includes theological seminaries, law schools,
medical colleges, and military academies, as well as high schools,
generally termed in this country academies. The professional
schools, several of them, possess the best special libraries in the
country.
6. Libraries of learned Societies-scientific, literary and histori-
cal. These libraries are mostly composed of the transactions of
similar societies, and of periodicals which contain the current records
of science and letters. ... Some of these collections are extensive
and important. The historical societies are doing great service in
gathering and
guarding the precious memorials of our early annals.
7. Public School Libraries.-Several of the States have taken
great interest in supplying every township and school district with a
library. Other States have commenced such collections, and it is to
be hoped that they may be greatly multiplied. They are not in-
tended for pupils alone, but for all the population of the district or
township to which they belong. They are composed of valuable
books, designed and adapted to communicate useful knowledge in a
popular way, and to cultivate all the higher elements of character.
They are in continual use, and it is impossible to over-estimate their
beneficial influence.”
8. Sunday-school Libraries."
From books the transition is newspapers.
The newspapers
of America are a marked feature in the literary and social character
of the people; and it is well that the authorities availed themselves
of the machinery of the Census to obtain some definite particulars
respecting them. According to the Report, " The newspaper and
periodical statistics fall short of, rather than exceed the reality.
Of the whole list, between forty and fifty are published in German,
about a dozen in French, several in Spanish, Italian, &c.”
In 1850, there were published in the United States, 2,526 news-
papers and periodicals, issuing annually 426,409,978 copies. Of these
254 were issued daily, printing annually 235,119,966 copies; 115
tri-weekly, printing 11,811,140 copies annually ; 31 semi-weekly,
printing 5,565,176 copies; 1,902' weekly, printing 153,120,708

copies; 95 semi-monthly, printing 11,703,480 copies; 100 monthly,
printing 8,887,808 copies ; 19 quarterly, printing annually 103,500
copies. These are classified as follows:- literary and miscellaneous,
568, printing annually 77,877,276 copies ; neutral and independent,
83, printing annually, 88,023,953 copies ; political, 1,630, printing

Of a subject so extensive, and so difficult, even in an old country,
to condense and classify, as the occupations of the people, the statis-
tics could hardly be expected, in such a country as this, to be other
than very imperfect. The Report says,
“ It is much to be regretted
that no better exposition could be made in this publication of the
employments of the people of the United States. The same diffi-
culties have occurred with us that occurred in taking the Census of
Great Britain. The tables which are given include only the free
males over 15 years of age; it is easy, at a glance, to detect the
frequent deficiencies of the figures. States are returned with an
aggregate of certain occupations greatly short of what is known to be
the fact, and what can be proved by local directories and registers.
Occupations are not registered which, in the same manner, are ascer-
tained to exist. A small State will approximate to the number of a
large one in occupations that are known to obtain in very nearly
equal proportions in all of the States. The ratio of occupations to
the whole number of males over 15 years of age in the several States,
varies, without regard to, and even in spite of, known rules. The
occupations on the population sheet differ widely-more widely than
was called for from those collected on the sheets of industry, and
aggregated and annexed, &c.”
This being so, it does not appear necessary for us to spend much
space on this head of our subject. The most broad statement of the
results will probably suffice. Of the free male population of the
United States over 15 years of age, there were, in 1850, 1,596,265
employed in commerce, trade, manufactures, mechanic arts, and
mining; in agriculture, 2,400,583; labour not agricultural, 993,620;
the army, 5,370 ; sea and river navigation, 116,341 ; law, medicine,
and divinity, 94,515; other pursuits requiring education, 95,814;
government civil service, 24,966; domestic servants, 22,243; other
occupations, 22,159 ; total, 5,371,876. Had we space, we might
perhaps select some interesting particulars from the list of occupa-
tions. The characteristic employments of the country appear to be
fewer than might be expected; the most noticeable perhaps are, ice.
dealers, 219; hunters, trappers, and rangers, 619; lumberers,
10,070; and pedlars, 10,669. A few might be selected as showing
the different way in which words have come to be accepted in the
United States and in the mother-country. Thus while there were,
at the last Census of Great Britain, only 2,328 physicians to 15,163
surgeons, in the United States there were only 191 surgeons to
40,564 physicians! This might be cited as an example of the fond-
ness of the Americans for big-sounding words: but then, on the

other hand, we find that they have 6,013 barbers, and not one

The subject of agricultural statistics has of late attracted consider-
able attention in this country. In the United States these statistics
are collected with much minuteness. The difficulties attending their
collection have not been, however, overcome ; and the results tabu.
lated in the Census returns must be received rather as approximations
than accurate statements.
The number of acres of improved land in farms, June 18, 1850, was
113,032,614; of unimproved, 180,528,000 acres. The principal
grain crop of the United States is maize (Indian corn), of which the
amount raised was 592,071,104 bushels : it was raised largely in all
the States, but the greatest quantities were, in Ohio, 59,078,695
pushels ; Kentucky, 58,672,591 bushels Illinois, 57,646,984
bushels ; Indiana, 52,964,363 bushels ; and Tennessee, 52,276,223
bushels. Of wheat, the total crop was 100,485,944 bushels; of
which were raised in Pennsylvania, 15,367,691 bushels; Ohio,
14,487,351; New York, 13,121,498 ; and Virginia, 11,212,616
bushels. Of rye, the total quantity raised was 14,188,813 bushels;
whereof Pennsylvania raised 4,805,160; New York, 4,148,182; and
New Jersey, 1,255,578 bushels. Of oats, 146,584,179 bushels were
raised; of which, 26,552,814 bushels were raised in New York ;
21,538,156 in Pennsylvania ; 13,472,742 in Ohio; 10,179,144 in
Virginia ; and 10,087,241 in Illinois. Of barley, 5,167,015 bushels
were grown, of which, about two-thirds, 3,585,059 bushels were
grown in New York. Of buckwheat, 8,596,912 bushels were raised;
of which, 3,183,953 bushels in New York, and 2,193,692 in Penn-
sylvania. The cultivation of rice is confined to the Slave States. The
total quantity of rice raised was 215,313,497 lbs. ; of which nearly
three-fourths, 159,930,613 lbs. were raised in South Carolina ; and
38,950,691 lbs. in Georgia. Of potatoes, 65,797,896 bushels, and of
sweet potatoes, 38,268,148 bushels were raised. Of peas and beans,
9,219,901 bushels. Of tobacco, the total crop was 199,752,655 lbs.;
the principal tobacco states being Virginia, 56,803,227 lbs.; Ken-
tucky, 55,501,196 lbs.; Maryland, 21,407,497 lbs.; Tennessee,
20,148,932 lbs.; and Missouri, 17,113,784 lbs.; Cotton is only
grown in the Slave States. The quantity of ginned cotton packed
was 2,469,093 bales, of 400 lbs. cach. The States which produced
the largest quantity were, Alabama, 564,429 bales ; Georgia,
499,091 bales; Mississippi, 484,292 bales ; and South Carolina,
300,901 bales. Of cane sugar, 247,577,000 lbs. were produced, of
which, Louisiana alone produced 226,001,000 lbs. ; the next largest
producers being Alabama, 8,242,000 lbs. ; and Texas, 7,351,000 lbs.
Of maple sugar, the quantity made was 34,253,436 lbs. ; 10,357,484
lbs. being made in New York, and 6,349,357 in Vermont. Of mo-
lasses, 12,700,896 gallons were made, 10,931,177 gallons being made
in Louisiana. Of wine, 221,249 gallons were made ; the largest
quantities being made, in California, 58,055 gallons; Ohio, 48,207;
and Pennsylvania, 25,590 gallons. Of hay, 13,838,642 tons were
made. Of hops, 3,497,029 lbs. were raised; 2,536,299 lbs. being

raised in New York. Of clover-seeds, 468,978 bushels were ga-
thered; of other grass-seeds, 416,831 bushels. Of flax-seed, 562,312
bushels; and of Aax, 7,709,676 lbs. The value of orchard products
was 7,723,186 dollars, of which New York claims 1.761,950 dollars.
Of market-garden produce, the total value was 5,280,030 dollars.
The live-stock consisted of 4,336,719 horses ; 559,331 asses and
mules; 6,385,094 milch cows; 1,700,744 working oxen; and
9,693,069 other cattle ; 21,723,220 sheep; and 30,354,213 swine;
together valued at 544,180,516 dollars; the value of animals slaugh-
tered, being 111,703,112 dollars. The products of animals were-
butter, 313,345,306 lbs.; cheese, 105,535,893 lbs. ; wool, 52,516,959
lbs. ; bees-wax and honey, 14,853,790 lbs.; silk cocoons, 10,843 lbs.
The value of home manufactures was estimated at 27,493,644 dollars.
We have thus, as far as space permitted, endeavoured to set forth
the results of the seventh Census of the United States. From the
want of any clear summary in the Census Report, our task has been
a somewhat laborious one; but we hope we have succeeded in show-
ing pretty distinctly the amazing progress of this mighty country, so
that the reader will be ready to acknowledge in this record, the ac-
complishment of a great present, as well as the promise of a nobler
future, if he be not quite prepared to adopt the swelling words with -
which the Superintendent of the Census, Mr. De Bow, concludes his
“ Introductory Letter.”
“ In the magnificent progress of the country within the past sixty
years, so elaborately shown in this volume, in territory, in population,
in industry, and in wealth, beyond all precedent in history, beyond
all the dreams of enthusiasts, --- how much room is there for gratitude
in every American heart! With free institutions; with just and
equitable laws, meted out with the same hand to the low and to the
high ; with virtue, and intelligence, and energy, and industry, co-
working harmoniously together, the many constituting one; with
power at home and character abroad; who shall question the future
which is before us? The balance sheet of the past has been made
up: the record is presented here !"
Grand words, truly! But an American, straining to be eloquent
on such a theme, may well be pardoned if he do not, as judicious
Master Hooker hath it, “ take the measure of his words with
per-
fect accuracy.
>>
No enumeration was made of the Indians in the United States
when the Census was taken ; but the Commissioner of Indian Af-
fairs estimated " the total number of Indians of both sexes and all
ages” in the United States, November 10, 1853, at 400,764, who
were thus distributed :--California, 100,000 ; New Mexico, 45,000 ;
Texas, 29,000 ; Utah territory, 11,500 ; in Oregon and Washington
territories, 23,000 ; in the Valley of the Missouri, 43,430 ; 20,000
Indians of the Plains or Arkansas Valley; and the remainder for
the most part in Indian Territory West. It will thus be seen that
the Indians have been entirely removed from the older states, and
that the great bulk of them are the native Indians of the newly-
acquired states and territories.

III. THE SANITARY STATE OF TOWN DWELLINGS.
The recent desolating effects of cholera in the metropolis and a few
other of our large towns have shown how absolutely necessary are
improved arrangements for cleanliness in the dwellings of our dense
population. Although there have been exceptions to the rule, cer-
tainly the worst attacks have been in the distressed neighbourhoods.
But irrespective of cholera attacks, there is most crying need of
house reform. We have to convince the dwellers themselves that
a change is necessary; if they were convinced and resolute, no
niggardly or heedless landlords would long be allowed to leave their
houses in wretched plight. The law of supply and demand prevails
here as elsewhere; if lodgers would not hire unwholesome rooms, or
tenants hire unwholesome houses, a magical effect would soon be pro-
duced on those to whom the rent would be paid. But the people
are slow to learn, and heedless to observe on this matter: they know
that the evil exists, but they do not know how much lies in their
own power towards working a cure. It is in this direction that the
labours of societies render service in pointing out to others how
those others may work out their own improvement. A few examples
of this may be given :-
The 'Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes'
has sought to carry out its objects by many concurrent methods ; viz.,
by arranging and executing plans, as models, for the improvement
of humble dwellings; by establishing the field-garden system, the
cottage-allotment system, the friendly-benefit system, and the provi-
dent-loan system, on sound principles, and reporting the results for
the guidance of other parties; by the formation of county, parochial,
and district associations, acting upon uniform plans ; and by corre-
spondence with clergymen, magistrates, landed proprietors, and other

a
persons willing to aid the general plan in their respective localities.
It is only in relation to the dwellings of the labouring classes that
we notice these plans here; but it is right to know what the Society
has effected in this respect.
The Society was established in 1844, and for some years brought
forward models of improved dwellings adapted to the various circum-
stances of the industrial classes. It was felt that “ no description or
reasoning, however forcible—no plans or estimates, however suitable
and accurate-would be likely to make such an impression on the
public as actual experiments, and the demonstration by experience
that a fair return might be obtained for all investments judiciously laid
out” in this direction. The Society built its first set of model dwell-
ings on a vacant piece of ground between Gray's Inn Road and
Bagnigge Wells Road.* They consist of a double row of two-story
houses facing each other; there are three distinct plans followed in
their form and arrangement; and the whole will accommodate 23
families and 30 single females. Nine families occupy each a small
house of three rooms; fourteen families occupy seven houses, a floor
of two rooms for each family; thirty widows or single females
occupy one room each in a centre-building appropriated to all of
them. On all the three plans, a ain object in view has been to
combine every point essential to the health, comfort, and moral habits
of the inmates, especially in regard to ventilation, drainage, and an
ample supply of water.
A second example presented by the Society, was in the erection of
an improved lodging-house for working-men. The Earl of Shaftes-
bury, when Lord Ashley, showed that single men were as badly off
as families, in respect to the means for obtaining decent lodgings at
moderate rents. "A labouring man comes to a town where employ-
ment is to be had, when he is in the prime of life, from 25 to 35,
and capable of making fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five shillings per
week. It is necessary he should take a lodging near the place
where his work is carried on. The tenements he has to choose
from are many of them in ill-drained, ill-ventilated neighbourhoods,
of filthy description. From these, however, he is compelled to
make his selection. What is the consequence? The consequence,
as appears from the testimony of city missionaries and ministers of all
denominations, is, that of hundreds and hundreds of these men,
who come in the prime of life to a town in search of employment, it
is found, ere long, that their health is broken down
that they
come on the parish—that they sink into the grave !"
So far as regards single men, artizans and labourers in London, it
is pretty well known that they pay an average rental which ought to
secure for them clean and wholesome, instead of dirty and squalid
lodgings; and it was to make this manifest that the Society built its
model lodging-house for working men, in George Street, Bloomsbury, .
This is intended for 104 working men. Suffice it here to say, that
the aim was to combine everything deemed essential or valuable in
* Many of the buildings mentioned in this article have been described in the last
five or six volumes of the Companion,' in the sections relating to Public Improve-
ments.' Any detailed description of them here may be dispensed with.

such an establishment, such as complete ventilation and drainage ;
the use of a distinct living room; a kitchen and wash-house common
to all; a bath with an ample supply of water ; separation and retire-
ment in the sleeping apartments. All these plans have been thought-
fully carried out.
The Society wished also to show that, without incurring the ex-
pense of erecting an entirely new building, much good might result
from remodelling existing buildings. With this view, three lodging-
houses were taken in one of the worst neighbourhoods in London,
Charles Street, Drury Lane. They were completely renovated, and
converted into one house, which has been fitted up with clean and
wholesome beds, and all other appurtenances requisite for the health
and comfort of 82 working men. These men pay fourpence per
night, or two shillings per week—the same amount as is usually
charged in the neighbouring wretched lodging-houses. The house
is clean and orderly, the comforts are far beyond the usual average,
and- yet the rental pays a fair return on the capital expended—just
the result which it was desired to exhibit. The Society then fitted
up, in Hatton Garden, a somewhat similar lodging-house for 57
women, since occupied as a female emigrant depôt.
The George Street establishment is an example of a lodging-house
for single men on the continental system that is, having a great
number of separate tenements or homes in one large building. The
Society then resolved to attempt something of the same kind for fami-
lies. Hence the 'model lodging-house for families,' in Streatham
Street, Bloomsbury. A leading feature here is, the preservation of the
domestic privacy and independence of each distinct family. Another
work by the Society arose out of a suggestion made by the Bishop
of London, that the thank-offerings of November 15, 1849, after the
cessation of the cholera, should be applied to the promotion of some
well-considered plan for improving the dwellings of the labouring
classes. The funds obtained by the Society through this channel
were appropriated to the purchase of a freehold site in Portpool
Lane, Gray's Inn Lane, and to the building of a lodging-house which
should comprise 20 tenements for poor families, apartments for 128
single women, a public wash-house, and a cellar beneath for huck-
sters' goods. Such are the • Thanksgiving Model Buildings.' The
128 single females are believed to be mostly poor seamstresses : they
live two in a room, and pay one shilling per week each.
The total expenditure by the Society on the six properties in
Bagnigge Wells Road, George Street, Streatham Street, Portpool
Lane, Charles Street, and Hatton Garden, down to the middle of
1854, was about 35,6301. On these the gross rents for the last
year were 3,1501., the current expenses and repairs 1,9231., and the
net rents 1,2271. The ratio which the aggregate current expenses
bear to the aggregate gross rents received for all the buildings is 61
per cent.. A very large per-centage this, and one which leads many
of the friends of this institution to question whether the build-
iny of costly new dwellings will be so easy to manage as the improve-
ment of old ones. The point is not how much return will be
obtained for so much money, but how many persons can obtain an

a
improvement in their houses for so much money. The George Street
establishment pays now a dividend of about 6 per cent., on a cost of
6,0001. or 7,0001. for 104 inmates ; but could not more than 104
persons be enabled to exchange dirty comfortless homes for clean
healthy homes, by an appropriation of 6,0001. or 7,0001. in some other
way? The Charles Street establishment is an example wherein a
small sum has been expended in improving cheap existing houses;
and the number of persons who feel the benefit is large in relation to
the sum expended, while the returns of those who advanced the
money will be satisfactory. At the last annual meeting of the Society,
the chairman announced it as the future plan to take some large ex-
tensive, filthy locality, some place that has neither ventilation nor
drainage, where people are living in the greatest misery and want of
the decencies and comforts of life; to "take such a place either by
purchase or lease, and expend upon it a certain sum of money to lay
down drainage, to destroy the cul-de-sac, to refresh and enliven the
courts and alleys, repair and whitewash the houses, and then let
them out—not at the same rent, but at reasonable, fair, and remune-
rative rents, probably to the people who now occupy them. My
belief is, that 5,0001. or 10,0001. expended in that way would give
greater relief, or certainly as much relief, as 50,0001. or 60,0001.
expended in the other way. You would not have precisely the same
amount of accommodation, it is true; but you would inconceivably
improve their present condition.”
We must not end our notice of this Society without mention of the
praiseworthy exertions of the honorary architect, Mr. Roberts. He
has assisted the Society in every possible way, relating to his profes-
sional services. He has published a volume, on “ The Dwellings of
the Labouring Classes,” containing not only plans and elevations of
all the buildings belonging to the Society, but suggestive plans,
elevations, descriptions, and estimates, for the use of any and all who
may wish to engage in the good work of building wholesome dwell-
ings at moderate expense. Such services are valuable, and should be
borne in mind. The authorities of many towns in foreign countries
have applied to the Society, for advice and suggestions relative to
these matters.
Another institution now calls for a little notice at our hands :-
In looking at what has been done by the Metropolitan Associa-
tion for improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes,' we
cannot do better than take as our basis Dr. Southwood Smith's
* Results of Sanitary Improvement '—a pamphlet published in 1854,
containing a large amount of information at the smallest price.
About the year 1841, a number of persons, convinced that clean,
wholesome houses might be let at a low rent, and yet pay a fair in-
terest on the capital expended, determined to make this truth mani.
fest by actual experiment. Their plan was to erect a large building,
divided into suites of apartments, capable of accommodating a number
of families, and having provision for the thorough subsoil drainage of
the site, the free admission of air and light to every inhabited room,
the effecting of complete house-drainage by the abolition of the cess-
pool system, the maintenance of an abundant supply of pure water,

and the nieans for easy removal of all dust and solid refuse. If such
a plan were carried out, and found to be successful, it was hoped that
it might serve as a stimulant in other quarters; for the germ of the
theory was, not to give good dwellings, but to show that good dwell-
ings might be had as cheaply as bad ones. At first the state of the
law in respect to the unlimited liability of partnerships interfered with
the formation of the proposed association; but a charter granted by
the Crown removed this difficulty. A kind of joint-stock company
was sanctioned by the charter, of which the shareholders were limited
to 5 per cent. interest on the capital advanced by them. This capital
was in the first instance limited to 100,0001. ; but powers were after-
wards obtained to raise it to 1,000,0001., as a fund for establishing
branch associations in provincial districts.
All these preliminary arrangements, and the building of the first
group of houses, occupied six or seven years. This first group,
called the " Metropolitan Buildings,” is situated in Pancras Road,
near the Old Church. On account of the high value of land, the
houses were built five stories in height, to make the most of the
space. Considering it as one large house, the building comprises 110
sets of rooms, 20 being sets of two rooms, and 90 of three rooms-
all well provided with arrangements for comfort and cleanliness. The
total expenditure was 17,7361. The sets of rooms let at rents vary-
ing from 3s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. weekly per set—which is known to be
below the rental of miserable, dirty rooms in the Drury-Lane district,
or in the low courts of Westminster. One week's rent is paid in ad-
It is seldom that any set remains unoccupied longer than a
weck; and in general there are numerous applicants on the list for
any vacancies that may occur.
The association built another group
in Albert Street, Mile End New Town; this group has 60 sets of
rooms, and cost 10,2971. They also purchased 25 houses in Pelham
Street and Pelham Row, Mile End, and adapted them to the purposes
in view; the cost was 5,1211., and the families accommodated 25.
Without detailing, one by one, the proceedings of the Association,
it will suffice to give a few results from the Tenth Annual Report, to
March 1854. It appears that there are now six establishments be-
longing to the Association, in Pancras Road, Albert Street Mile
End, Pleasant Row and Pelham Street, in Mile End Road, Nelson
Street in the Borough, and Soho Chambers. These have cost 51,4141.
The net rents in the year ending March, 1854, amounted to 1,7691.
The gross rental was 4,8091. ; but the charges--comprising ground-
rents, poor, police, paving, lighting, and sewers’ rates, house-duty,
Jand-tax, property-tax, repairs, water, gas, cleaning, superinten-
dents, servants, insurance, and a few other items-amounted to
the seriously large sum of 3,0401., being more than 60 per cent, on
the rental. Besides the above, the Association have in progress two
other properties, in New Street, Golden Square, and in Queen's
Place, Dockhead. Both of these were commenced by the Society
for Improving the Dwellings of the Working Classes,' but afterwards
passed over to the Association.
The recent report speaks favourably of the country branches.
These have been formed at Brighton, Dudley, Newcastle, Ramsgate,
vance.

Southampton, and Torquay, with an aggregate capital of 34,0001.
Affiliated associations are also expected to be formed at Liverpool,
Bristol, Coventry, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Plymouth, Wolver.
hampton, Worcester ; and applications to the parent association for
information and assistance have been made from Lambeth, Westminster,
St. Martin's in the Fields, Sydenham, Stoke Newington, Camden
Town, Hampstead, Highgate, Islington, Richmond, and other
places.
So much for the financial result, which, though not brilliant, is
expected to be ultimately satisfactory. And now for the sanitary
result.
In 1850-51-52, the mortality at the Pancras buildings was so
much below the general London average as to excite considerable
surprise. It was, on a mean of the three years, only 13.6 per 1,000;
and the mean of all the Association's buildings, in the year ending
March 1854, was only 7 per 1,000; while the average for the whole
metropolis in 1852 was 22 per 1,000. But it is in relation to infant
life that the wretched homes of the labouring-classes tell most fear-
fully, and it is here that the improved dwellings bring out the
strongest contrast ; the deaths of children under 5
years
of
age
have
been, in the various buildings, about 5 per 1,000 per annum ; whereas
in the whole metropolis it has reached, in the same year, 46 per
1000. The notorious place called the “ Potteries,” in the Notting
Hill district of Kensington parish (further noticed in another page),
has presented a sad contrast to this. In 1852, while the whole deaths
in the Association's buildings were 7 per 1,000, in the “Potteries
they were 40 per 1000; and of children under 10 years of age, 10
per 1,000 in the one case, and 109 per 1,000 in the other.
It is, indeed, a great fact, in respect to all these praiseworthy
efforts, that wherever cleanliness and comfort have been thus in-
creased, disease and death have lessened. In the year 1849, when
the cholera attacked the metropolis, not one single death, we believe,
took place from this cause at any one of the buildings belonging to
either of the two institutions; and we have lately ascertained that
during the calamitous attack of 1854, none have suffered from the
cholera among the inmates of the Society's establishments, and a few
members of only one family in one of the establishments belonging to
the Association. The ratio of deaths at these last-nanied establish-
ments we have already mentioned as having been very low in the
years 1850-1-2-3. In the Society's establishments, 24 died out of
1470, in the year 1853, being 1 in 61, or 1.67 per cent. In London
generally, taking all deaths from all causes, about 12 per cent. are
caused by typhus or similar fever-not one death from such a cause
has occurred in the various model-dwellings, so far as we have heard.
A hasty glance must now be made at two statutes which are calcu.
lated to aid in sanitary reform, the “ Common Lodging-Houses Act,”
and the “ Labouring Classes Lodging-Houses Act.”
On the 8th of April, 1851, Lord Ashley obtained leave to intro-
duce the bills into the Commons, and on the 24th of June-having
in the interim succeeded to the earldom of Shaftesbury-he moved
the second reading in the Lords. The appalling facts which led to

a
these enactments came upon the public by surprise. Few were pre-
pared to believe the state of degradation, both moral and physical,
which was exhibited in the vast majority of the humbler lodging-
houses. The Reports of the Health of Towns' Commission, and a
pamphlet on the Lodging-Houses of London, by the London City
Missionary Society, were received with incredulity in many quarters;
but they are now believed to have been scarcely, if at all, coloured or
exaggerated. The Earl of Shaftesbury, when he introduced the bills
into the Commons, cited some of the (now well known) instances of
lodging-houses in which disease and dirt result from a whole family
living in one room; and then he added : “ But this return said
nothing of the condition of a great many of the residences of the
working people, in which there was not merely one family in a room,
but two families, three, four, and, as he had himself seen, five-four
occupying the corners, and the fifth the middle of the room. Nothing
produced so evil an effect upon the sanitary condition of the popula-
tion as overcrowding within limited spaces; and if people are in a
low sanitary condition, it is absolutely impossible to raise them to a
just moral elevation. Their general state of health and capacity for
work reduced, they must be brought upon the parish and the general
charity of the community."
A brief notice will suffice to convey an idea of the general scope
and purport of the “Common Lodging-House Act. The main
object is, in fact, to apply, generally, provisions similar to, but more
efficient than, those which were before in force with respect to the
registration, inspection, and general supervision of common lodging-
houses in districts under the Public Health Act' of 1848. А
common lodging-house,” in the eye of the statute law, is “any
public lodging-house, not being a licensed victualling house, in which
persons are harboured or lodged for a single night, or for less than a
week at one time, or in which any room is let for hire, to be occupied
by more than one family at one time.” The Act is to be put in force
by the commissioners of metropolitan police, or by a local board of
health, or by a municipal corporation, or by improvement commis-
sioners, or by justices of the peace, according to the circumstances of
any particular place. As the City of London Sewers Act, 1848,
contains provisions for the well-ordering of common lodging-houses
within the City, the present Act is not made applicable in that part
of the metropolis. Whoever may be the governing body, and
wherever may be the district, notice is to be given to the keeper of
any common lodging-house, requiring him to register his house,
under penalty. From that time he is not to receive any lodger until
the house has been inspected and approved. The authorities have
power to make bye-laws and regulations, subject to the approval of
the Home Secretary, respecting the well-ordering of the lodging-
houses, the separation of the sexes therein, and fixing the number of
lodgers who may be received in each house. The keeper of the
house is bound to subject it to such cleansing as the authorities may
direct, to give notice to a medical officer of the existence of any fever
or contagious disease in the locality, and to admit the inspecting
officer at all times.

a
Now it is gratifying to know that these stringent rules-interfering
somewhat with the old cherished maxim of u
every man doing what
he likes with his own”—have wrought much good in the metropolis,
and may equally work good elsewhere. Captain Hay is the chief
inspector in the metropolis, and he has thrown an immense amount
of labour and energy into the cause. By the middle of 1854, the
whole of the common lodging-houses, about 7,000 in number, had
been visited and carefully inspected, and 1,440 of them had been
registered as being in a satisfactory condition for the reception of
lodgers ; the others are visited from time to time, and will continue
to be so until they are pronounced to be in a satisfactory state. It
is felt that ultimate good will best be wrought by gradual means,
without hurry or too great stringency. The Earl of Shaftesbury, at
a meeting held at Exeter Hall in June, 1854, speaking of the result
of Captain Hay's registration of these 1,440 houses, said, “ These
houses are whitewashed four times in the year, and swept every
morning; the sexes are separated ; and not more than a certain
number of persons are allowed in each room, the full amount of cubic
feet of air being allotted to each person. And what has been the
result? The result in London has been, that among the 30,000 per-
sons living in these 1,440 houses, there have been during the whole
of the twelve months only ten cases of fever, and no one of them has
terminated fatally ; and yet many of these houses have had twenty
cases of fever in a single year in a single house. This has had a
corresponding effect upon the morals of the people; for I am told
that nothing can be more orderly, decent, and cleanly than they now
are.” The same nobleman unexpectedly received, about the saine
time, an address of thanks from the inhabitants of lodging-houses in
a court near Long Acre, for his instrumentality in procuring the
passing of the Common Lodging-houses Act.' They spoke in warm
and grateful terms of the improvement in comfort and cleanliness
which had resulted from the application of the terms of the Act to
the court in which they lived. This, after all, will be the true test;
if cleanliness and salubrity supervene, without any violent overturn-
ing of existing arrangements, the good will be great-better thus,
than that any government or any municipality should become lodging-
house keepers.
The other statute, 'The Labouring Classes' Lodging-houses Act'
of 1851, is almost exactly analogous in its official machinery to the
‘Baths and Wash-house Acts' of 1846 and 1847; that is, the govern-
ing bodies of towns and districts may encourage the establishment of
lodging-houses for the labouring classes, in the same way as baths
and washhouses for the same classes. Of course it is to be inferred
that if the authorities build, or purchase, or rent lodging-houses,
they will take care that health and cleanliness are attended to in the
management, and that the rental paid by the lodgers shall be suffi-
ciently low to afford a premium for decent instead of dirty habits.
There can be no question that the exertions of the societies already
noticed, and the provisions of the Acts just adverted to, ought to
improve the health of the inmates of houses subjected to these ameli-
orations; and, as we have seen, such is really the case, Indeed, a

good reward meets sanitary exertions on all sides of us. There is a
place called Lambeth Square, near the Waterloo Road, consisting of
neat but badly-built houses; that is, bad in respect to original defects
of drainage. In 1851 discase and death were terrible visitants there,
sweeping away numbers which could not be accounted for in any
other way than by reason of the bad drainage. In 1852 the drainage was
amended, and the houses have been since healthy even above the usual
metropolitan average. The superintendent of police at Wigan states
hat, although 30,000 lodgers passed through 24 registered lodging-
houses of that town in 1853, there has not been a single case of fever
since the Lodging-house Act has been in force. Still more extraor-
dinary is the fact that 511,000 lodgers have lived and slept in 200
registered lodging-houses at Wolverhampton without one case of
fever. Morpeth and Carlisle have told a like tale.
There is a private local association for house reform and sanitary
improvement, which merits a little notice here.
The “ Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association was founded,
not to supersede any legislative or municipal plans, but in furtherance
of them-to do many things which no lawmakers can do ; that is, to
get the people to be thoughtful for the people's welfare. The
primary object was, to bring to bear upon the inhabitants generally,
and upon the working-classes particularly, such an amount of know-
ledge pertaining to physiological and sanitary science as may induce
an intelligent attention to ascertained laws of health. One mode of
working out the intended result is by district visitation. Manchester
and Salford have been divided into eight districts, to which about
300 visitors have been appointed; these visitors have been desired to
ascertain, so far as can be done without an obtrusive attack upon the
privacy of a man's home, the state and contiguity of the poorer dwell-
ings, the evidences of personal neglect in sanitary matters, and the
kind of gratifications and amusements to which the indwellers accustom
themselves. Another mode is by the publication of tracts, pur-
chaseable at a cheap price : several of these have appeared ; and the
committee state that paucity of funds has been the only obstacle to
the publication of a short systematic series, conveying elementary
instruction on physiological and sanitary subjects, written in simple
language for the use of schools-certainly a novel and important idea.
A third method is by the delivery of lectures, at school-rooms in the
various districts, by gentlemen whose gratuitous services are procured
through the instrumentality of the institution, and on subjects more
or less closely connected with the avowed objects of the Association.
We have before us, in the First Annual Report, a list of the subjects
of 43 of these lectures ; they relate to food, digestion, water, beve-
rages, respiration, ventilation, drainage, cleanliness, bathing, clothing,
house economy, epidemics, and contagion-on all matters, indeed,
that relate to the maintenance of health among the people. It is
an important evidence of the value likely to result from the labours
of such an association, that the clergy lend an earnest hand in the
matter : five Manchester clergymen are among the lecturers. A
fourth method is by class instruction-to the teachers of day-schools
and to the town missionaries. If the school teachers and the moral

a
teachers can know something concerning sanitary matters, they may
impart a little of this something to those under their care, and so
render a double service : thus thought the Association, and the
thought is a good one. A fifth method is by investigations. Many
blots, physical and moral, require to be diligently ferreted out, before
their existence will be fully admitted by the world at large. Among
the blots which the Association have endeavoured to investigate are
these :- Why is the water supplied from the water-pipes frequently
in a turbid state ? What connexion is there between water-levels
and the production of disease ? What is the peculiar localization of
epidemic diseases ? And to what causes, either precise or approxi.
mate, is the localization attributable ? On all these subjects the
Association appears to have collected useful information. A sixth
method is by prize essays. There have been obtained, through the
incitement of a prize, many essays on the method best adapted to the
ventilating small dwellings; such method being simple in its form
and construction, self-acting, and special in its applicability to cottage
property, both old and new; and the Association announce an inten-
tion, with the consent of the several writers, of selecting the most
practical suggestions contained in these essays, and combining the
whole in a concise and familiar treatise on cottage ventilation. And,
lastly, a method whereby the Association secks to increase its useful-
ness is by co-operation and correspondence with other societies, and
with governmental and municipal bodies, that each may gain
strength by giving.'
Such local institutions may do welcome service, by teaching our
fellow-men to think and act for themselves. The workmen's dwell.
ings at Birkenhead, the sailors' homes in London and elsewhere, the
model dwelling built by Mr. Lumsden at Glasgow, the agricultural
model cottages built by the Dukes of Bedford and Northumberland
and the Marquis of Breadalbane, the model dwellings which Prince
Albert built in Hyde Park, and which are now in Kennington Park,
the cottages built by Prince Albert at Windsor and by the Windsor
Royal Society, the dwellings being erected by Captain Rushout in
Bloomsbury, the comfortable houses built by Messrs. Pickford for
their labourers at Camden Town-all are instalments of the great
debt which is owed by those who are enjoying the blessings produced
by the combination of labour and science to that instrument of
national wealth, without which capital would be worthless—the
strength and intelligence of the great body of the people.
Dr. Sutherland has drawn attention to a fact which has much to
do with the dirty state of homes in low neighbourhoods, and with
the salubrity of the atmosphere. “The law permits any man not
only to keep refuse organic matter of all kinds near his own dwellingi
and those of his own neighbours, but he may proceed to make such
refuse an article of profitable manufacture. lle may boil bones,
make catgut or artificial manure, manufacture animal oils, or, indeed,
anything he thinks fit, whereby he can make money, provided he
does not commit what the law calls a nuisance; and even if he
should do so, the legal remedy is so expensive and difficult, that
ninety-nine nuisances in a hundred escape punishment altogether,

57
.
Moreover, the law takes no cognizance of the fact, that before any
putrescent refuse or unwholesome manufacture occasions what would
be considered a nuisance in law, it may already have undermined the
health of the whole neighbourhood from which the complaint pro-
ceeds.”
The number of ways in which uncleanly habits lead to a low state
of health is quite remarkable, and well worthy of attention. In
April, 1854, the Rev. C. Richson, of Manchester, preached in the
cathedral a sermon, tending to show that an observance of the sani-
tary laws, divinely appointed, in the Old Testament Scriptures, would
suffice to ward off preventable diseases from Christians as well as
Israelites. The sermon was well-timed, when the cholera was
known to be approaching, and the argument was ingeniously worked
out; but the reason for noticing it here is, that when it was after-
wards published for the benefit of the Manchester and Salford Sani-
tary Association, Dr. Sutherland, of the Board of Health, appended
some notes, which afford striking information concerning certain
localities in and near the metropolis, as well as farther distant.
Of the swine kept in dwelling-houses, Dr. Sutherland's account is
really astounding. He says that, during the expurgations in antici-
pation of the cholera, it has happened that swine have been ejected
from single rooms, which they inhabited along with the family, five
or six flats above the street. During the cholera visitation at New-
- castle on-Tyne, the authorities of Sunderland ejected from their
town no fewer than 3,000 pigs as a measure of precaution. In respect
to the uncleanly and unwholesome results of keeping swine in dwell-
ing-houses, Dr. Sutherland says:-“ A very striking illustration, or
rather experimental proof, of the degradation arising from this cause,
is afforded by the case of a village called “The Potteries,' situate in
the parish of Kensington. It is, or rather was till recently, in the
open country, and inhabited by a population of from 1,000 to 1,200
people, all engaged in the breeding and rearing of pigs. The pigs
usually outnumbered the people three to one, and had their stycs
mixed up with the dwelling-houses. In some cases they have been
found even inside the houses and under the beds. Let us now trace
the result of this experiment on the physical condition of the people,
on their health and on their moral condition.”. Dr. Sutherland pro-
ceeds to state that the houses are described by the surveyor of the
Metropolitan Commission of Sewers as being, many of them, mere
hovels in a ruinous condition, generally densely peopled, filthy in
the extreme, containing vast accumulations of offal. In respect to
health, the ordinary deaths among the people are 40 in 1,000 per
annum ; in sickly seasons it rises to 60. Fever has attacked ihe
population in the ratio of 128 in the 1,000 in a single year. No less
than 80 per cent of the entire mortality occurs amongst children
under 15 years of age. Nearly all the inhabitants look sallow and
unhealthy. The Rev. W. H. Ibbotson, speaking of the moral
characteristics of the inhabitants, says, “As a conscquence of their
physical degradation, the people are debased as to their morals, and
obstinately refuse all improvement.
A remarkable commentary has been made on what is called the

leprosy of houses. In the Sanitary Sermon (if it may be so called),
by the Rev. Mr. Richson, just noticed, attention was drawn to the
stringent rules laid down in the book of Leviticus. Whenever leprosy,
or the spreading of fungi, was observed on the walls of houses, the
leprous stones and plaster were to be immediately removed and
carried to an unclean place, and the walls to be repaired with new
material. If the leprosy after this reappeared, the house was to be
taken down, and all the materials of which it was composed were to
be carried away to an unclean place beyond the precincts of the
Israelitish city. In commenting on the above, Dr. Sutherland men-
tions that there are certain appearances, familiar to all sanitary
observers, analogous to this “ leprosy ” of a house. When a house
has been built in a locality where the air is constantly moist and
loaded with putrescent matter, or where a house has been over-
crowded and inhabited an undue length of time without the walls
having been cleansed, the plaster becomes saturated with damp, and
with organic matter proceeding from the condensation of moisture
from the breath, &c., which is loaded with such matter. Whenever
this takes place, the house becomes unhealthy, and the colour of the
walls becomes changed. A greenish or reddish tint, apparently
arising from the growth of minute lichens or fungi, appears in
various places ; "and it is in houses,” adds Dr. Sutherland," with
the walls in this condition, that cholera and other epidemics usually
select their earliest victims.” The amazing strictness of the laws
enjoined upon the Israelites would seem outrageous if interpreted
according to modern house usages; but they involve some of the
most essential characteristics of modern sanitary rule. The washing
of walls with quicklimè is known to be a potent means in arresting
the progress of cholera ; and the frequent lime-washing of common
lodging-houses is a most valuable preventive of fever.
amount of disease might be arrested in the present day if more care
were bestowed on the condition of the interior walls of houses.
Plaster and wall-papers are all absorbent, and become saturated in
time with those 'animal exhalations which engender pestilential
disease. Frequent cleansing and washing with quicklime is the great
preventive measure.
But modern science has even gone further, in
pointing out that the true method of preventing the saturation of
house-walls is to line them inside with glazed tile or glazed brick,
or some other non-absorbent substance.”
One point urgently calls for the attention of society. When a
new street is built, such as either of the two Victoria Streets in the
metropolis, what becomes of the poor? Where do those wend their
steps whose wretched houses have been pulled down? Do they not
crowd into courts and alleys, already overcrowded, and increase the
amount of squalor and disease? There can be no doubt that such is
the result. Legislators too seldom think of this when they pass
“ new street” Acts. If we would maintain our place amongst
civilized nations, the provision of fit dwellings for those who have
the means of paying for them by the wages of labour is the first duty,
and would be a far nobler work for a government to take in hand
than the efforts of Augustus to make Rome a city of marble instead
of a city of brick,

IV. OCCUPATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.
In the Companion for 1835, under the above heading, were given a
few extracts and tables from the Report of the Census of 1831. In
the previous enumerations of 1811 and 1821, inquiries had been
instituted as to how many families were employed in, or maintained
by, agriculture ; how many by trade or manufactures; and how many
which could not be brought under either of these designations. The
answers to thesc inquiries were given with tolerable fulness. In
1831, it was resolved to ascertain, so far as could be done, the occu-
pation of every male adult twenty years of age or upwards; this age.
was chosen because “ it is found that a man is usually settled in his
vocation at that age, which is also more definitely indicated as the
period which should be chosen, by the fact that the number of
males, above and under the age of twenty, had been found to be
nearly equal in the enumeration of 1821 ; and it was desirable to
make this fact available, as a check upon any errors which might
arise in the enumeration, as any considerable departure from this
obvious and established proposition would attract attention, and lead
to the correction of the error.” In our article, a series of tables was
given for all the counties of Great Britain in succession, containing
the numbers of adult males employed in nine classes of occupation,
and another group for females employed in domestic service. These
ten groups were-
1. Occupiers of land employing labourers.
2. Occupiers of land not employing labourers.
3. Labourers employed in agriculture.
4. Employed in manufacture.
5. Employed in retail trade or handicraft.
6. Capitalists, bankers, &c.
7. Labourers not agricultural.
8. Other males twenty years of age.
9. Male servants.
10. Female servants.
At the end of the paragraph relating to each county were given a
few notes, explanatory of the chief industrial characteristics of the
county, and, in some cases, a list of the minute subdivisions of
the principal manufacture carried on.
Ten years afterwards, in the Companion for 1845, was given a
similar account of the Census of 1841, in respect to the occupations
of the people. In 1831, a form, containing a list of one hundred dif-
ferent trades and handicrafts, being those most commonly carried on,
was furnished to 'the overseers in each parish or place required to
make a separate return, to be filled up with the number of males
aged twenty and upwards ; and the overseers were authorized to add
to the list such additional trades as were not included in the printed
form. But many anomalies and imperfections arose out of this plan;
and it was therefore resolved, in 1841, that the enumerator, instead
of using a prepared list of one hundred, or any other definite number
of trades, should insert each man's description of himself opposite his

manufactures, the subdivisions of labour entered in the schedules
were so minute, that there were no less than 1,225 distinct heads of
employment (some of them, it is true, identical) in the cotton manu-
factures of Lancashire; in 1831 the enumerators had entered only
598 for the whole of the county. In like manner, the London occu-
pations, given as 420 in 1831, were 757 in 1841; and the occupa-
tions of Great Britain became similarly increased from 598 to 877.
The enumeration of occupations thus became more minute; and at
the same time the sex of the workers was stated, and the numbers
given under twenty years of age as well as above. There was also a
new classification adopted, as follows :-
1. Commerce, trade, and manufactures.
2. Farmers and graziers.
3. Agricultural labourers.
4. Labourers not agricultural.
5. Clerical profession.
6. Legal profession.
7. Medical profession.
8. Other educated persons.
9. Male servants.
10. Female servants.
11. Persons of independent means.
12. Alms-people, pensioners, &c.
13. Aggregate of all occupations.
14. Residue of population, occupation unaccounted for.
Tables of the results are given with considerable fulness in the
Companion. We will reprint here two skřort entries from these
tables :

Occupations of the People.
61
It must be borne in mind, however, that this comparative state-
ment refers in the first three instances to families, but in 1841 to
individuals.
Another period of ten years has now elapsed, and it becomes our
duty to give some account of the Occupations of the People in 1851.
The returns relating to this subject are so voluminous, that it is no
longer desirable to attempt separate tables for each county ; such a
course would absorb too much space, and would, besides, shut out
many remarkable results, which have now for the first time been
ascertained. It is necessary first to notice the chief points in which
the Census of 1851 differed from those of earlier decennial periods
so far, at least, as relates to the Occupations of the People.
The Census of 1841 was managed by Mr. Vardon and Mr. Phipps;
but that of 1851 was intrusted to Major Graham, the Registrar
General of Births, Marriages, and Deaths, aided by Mr. Horace
Mann and Mr. Farr. The Registrar-General in his Report, speak-
ing of the Occupations of the People, says :-" This branch of the
abstracts has occupied a large portion of the labour of the Central
Office. It was considered important to extend the inquiry, so as
to show, as nearly as was practicable, the number of men, women,
and children in every trade or profession; and to obviate some of
the difficulties which had interfered with the previous inquiries,
instructions on important points were printed upon every household's
schedule ; and instructions still more elaborate were distributed
among the enumerators and registrars. The result has been a great
improvement in the quality of the information under this head;
although it is still imperfect, as the inquiry is attended with in-
herent difficulties, which can only be removed by special measures,
to which we shall shortly advert. If the names are taken by which
people designate their own occupations, it is found that they amount
to several thousands ; that, in some instances, the same name is
applied to different occupations ; that various names are applied to
the same occupations in different counties; and that the occupations
in town and country, in manufacturing and other districts, are sub-
divided to a greater or less extent. Several of the names are vague
and of doubtful interpretation."
Another difficulty is noticed. 6. It was held to be desirable, not
only to take out the numbers of persons of each sex in each oc-
cupation, but the numbers at each quinquennial period of age; for
without this information the relative salubrity of the professions,
and a great variety of important questions, cannot be determined.
But the mechanical difficulties of the undertaking were great. It
would be, and was felt to be, a vain expenditure of time to attempt
to compress the numbers returned under each occupation and each age
in one table for each district; so upon observing that certain occupa-
tions were followed by few persons, the printed list of males for use
in abstraction was reduced to 332 occupations, on lines which were
vertically cut by lines to indicate the quinquennial ages.”
The Registrar-General, therefore, determined that these 332
occupations should be published in detail for each county and dis-
trict; while all the odds and ends of occupations, in each of which

62
Occupations of the People.
only a few persons are employed, should be lumped together as
“others.” It was thought proper, however, that these v others ”
should be tabulated in some form or other; and it was consequently
resolved to prepare a table in which the occupations should be enu-
merated with great minuteness, for the whole of Great Britain taken
collectively, distinguishing the two sexes, and all ages from 5 years
to 85,
It is further remarked :- -“ It is important in a Census of the
People, to show not only the numbers that follow each occupation,
but their distribution over the country; and this, it will be seen, is
done, for counties, for districts, and for all the large towns of the
country. To this circumstance chiefly the voluminousness of the
publication is referable ; and it must be borne in mind that the
Census is a topographical as well as a national survey; and that, as
far as is practicable, it is desirable to supply the inhabitant of each
district with that information in which he is most particularly in-
terested; hence, in the First Report [of which an account was
given in the Companion for 1854] it was deemed right to publish the
area and population of each of the several thousands of parishes and
townships in Great Britain ; and in the present Tables, besides the
county returns, the occupations of the males and females of the age
of 20 years and upward in each district appear in detail.”
Besides the distribution of the occupations in different parts of the
country, it was deemed necessary to adopt some classification of the
occupations themselves, as well as a mere alphabetical list. On this
subject the Report states :—“ If the people are looked at in their
several occupations, striking differences will be immediately per-
ceived in the skill, talent, or intelligence that is exercised; in the
tools, instruments, machinery, and structures that are used; in the
materials that are worked ; in the processes of making or manufactur-
ing; and in the products that are created. All these elements and
;
their conflicting claims have been considered in the classification ;
but, in conformity with the first notions of mankind of which we
have record, the greatest weight has been given to the materials in
which people work; as they generally imply important modifications,
not only in the tools, in the machines, in the processes, and in the
products, but in the characters of the men. By his trade, and by
the matters which surround him, how different is the blacksmith from
the tailor ; the shoemaker from the hair-dresser; the butcher from
the baker; the horse-dealer from the grocer; the sweep from the
navy; the fisherman, the waggoner, the pedlar, and the cotton spin-
ner, from each other! The first and most obvious distribution of
the population is into the two great groups of those who work, and
those who professedly have no definite occupations. After a due
correction has been made for the persons who are infirm, or who
have retired in advanced age from their trades or professions, the
number of the latter class in this country will not be found to be
numerous," The Registrar-General then enumerates the classes
into which he has placed all the occupations, and explains the
principle on which he has brought the hundreds of detailed occupa-
tions as varieties and sub-varieties under these several classes,

a
The Report notices the advantages which would accrue from a
knowledge of the relative position of masters and workmen in the
several trades, as well as of the number and sizes of farms, and the
number of labourers employed by each farmer; and an explanation
is given of the degree to which a successful ascertainment of such
facts has been carried.
Such is a brief account, partly in Major Graham's own words, of
the chief points wherein the Census of 1851 differs from those of
preceding years, in respect to the Occupations of the People. It will
be seen that the differences are many and considerable, involving the
absorption of a much larger space in the Reports. Indeed no one
can glance through the Tables without being impressed with the
vast amount of labour and the skilful organization called for in the
work. Such Tables as are here produced have not only value for
the immediate and express object in view, but they form a basis on
which future and more accurate investigations may be founded.
We proceed to exhibit some of the results obtained, selecting
such as will illustrate various industrial phases of British population.
In respect to the connexion between age and occupation, there
are a few points developed in the Tables which may be adverted to.
Among the males in the whole of Great Britain, there are 15,908
aged 85 and upwards ; and it may be interesting to notice how these
old patriarchs are employed. After taking from the list 787 annui-
tants and independent gentlemen, 1,358 paupers, 1,124 persons
supported in idleness by the community in other ways, and 754 con-
cerning whom no specific description is given, there remain about
12,000 of these very old men, who appear to earn their living by
their brains or their hands. Of these about 6,000 are at once
absorbed in the three entries of farmers, agricultural labourers, and
labourers (undefined); there are 441 of these venerablemen
employed as shoemakers, and 242 as tailors, 387 as carpenters, and
119 as slaters, 183 as merchant seamen, and 115 as fishiermen. In
round numbers we may say, that of the males aged 85 and upwards,
two-eighths are persons of no definite occupation, three-eighths carn
their living out in the fields and roads, and three-eighths earn their
living in other ways.
Pursuing the same path of inquiry in respect to females, it appears
that the number aged 85 and upwards, far exceeds that of males,-
in accordance with a well-known law in relation to the ages of the
sexes; it is 24,505. The distribution of these old women, in
respect to occupations or social position, would of course differ con-
siderably from those of men. One-half of the whole number
absorbed in these two items-
Wives (not otherwise defined) 1,541
Widows

Of the remainder, there are 3,336 annuitants and independent
gentlewomen, and 3,478 supported by the community or by rela-
tions. These absorb another fourth ; and the last fourth present, as
their highest numbers, 403 seamstresses and needlewomen, 552

domestic servants (general), 327 servants of special kinds, 464
farmers. Of the actual workers, with any tools except a needle, we
may of course expect few; yet there are nail-makers, coal-miners,
carthenware manufacturers, rope-makers, weavers, brick-makers,
to be met with among these old women of 85 and upwards.
Going to the extreme verge of old age, we find there to be 111
males and 208 females above the age of 100 years. Of these 111
aged men, there are 16 farmers, 14 agricultural labourers, 14 paupers,
and 8 labourers (otherwise undefined); while the rest are scattered
in ones and twos among various occupations. Of the 208 women
who reached this advanced age, 104 are widows (otherwise unde-
fined), 13 domestic servants, 18 annuitants, and 26 paupers. But
even among these extremely aged females, we find a seamstress, a
schoolmistress, a pedlar, a milkseller, a confectioner, a brick-maker,
and one each employed in the cotton, woollen, worsted, and stuff
manufactures.
Of young workers, as contrasted with very aged workers, we shall
have occasion to speak presently.
In looking at the Tables with an eye towards more general
results, there are many interesting particulars which become deve-
loped. Here is one. The total population for 1851, of Great
Britain and the small adjacent islands, is set down at 20,959,477, of
whom 10,229,558 are males, and 10,735,919 females. One-half of
this total is 10,479,738. Now this is almost exactly identical with
the number (10,418,989) of those set down under some domestic
appellation, as wife, widow, daughter, grand-daughter, sister, niece,
son, grandson, brother, nephew, child under tuition at home, child
under tuition at school ; that is, persons to whom no occupation
whatever is attributed, but who are regarded as dependent on the
head of the family for support. Regarded in this light, therefore,
just one-half of the population have nothing and do nothing to earn
a living; they are the home-members of a family ; they may assist
in domestic labours, but they do not work at money-getting employ-
ments. There are then left half the population, who either possess
wealth already accumulated, or exercise their hands and heads in the
acquisition of wealth ; of this half, one moiety can, with a near
approach to correctness, be divided into five equal parts, thus
About 1,000,000 domestic servants.
1,000,000 employed in preparing the materials for dress.
1,000,000 employed in making dress.
1,000,000 ordinary agricultural labourers (males).
1,000,000 other persons, male and female, living by farm and
field operations.
Most of these numbers are slightly over the million. If we
suppose the two millions of farmers, graziers, gardeners, and in-door
and out-door farm servants of every kind, to be all employed in
raising food (and this is not such a wide departure from the truth as
to vitiate such general results as we have now in view) it brings us
to this conclusion ; of the total population, about 21,000,000, there

When the Commissioners came to prepare their vast tables of the
distribution of occupations in the respective divisions, counties,
districts, and towns, they had to determine how many different
occupations should be given in each table. If the whole 1057
occupations, presently to be adverted to, for males had been tabulated
for each and all of the topographical sections, the volumes would
have been numerous and bulky beyond all endurance, the labour
and expense enormously great, and the practical value very question-
able. The list was therefore weeded. Several occupations were
omitted which are only very limited in their topographical dis-
tribution, and all were omitted in which the total number of persons
is very small. Thus in the amplified table, for the whole of Great
Britain, we find only 2 persons entered as apparitors, 4 aurists,
3 respirator-makers, 2 school-secretaries, 5 shoeblacks, 2 lessees of
markets, 3 water-bailiffs, 4 grape-growers, 1 apiarian, 2 ventriloquists,
1
3 ballad-singers, 2 cartridge-makers, 3 bladder-dealers, 4 powder-
puff makers, 2 dulse-dealers, 3 wire-spring makers, 2 fancy-wood
dealers, 2 dock contractors, 2 waste paper dealers, 3 gold-miners.
This list will serve to illustrate some of the difficulties with which
the commissioners have had to contend; it is quite certain that there
are more than 2 ballad-singers, 2 dock-contractors, 2 fancy-good
dealers, 2 school-secretaries, 5 shoeblacks. The truth is that persons
occupied in many of these employments enter themselves as
belonging to other avocations, and the commissioners naturally de-
termined on striking out such minute details in their large tables.
Different degrees of minuteness, then, are adopted, according to the
nature of the tables. Thus, one table, for the whole of Great
Britain, gives all the 1,057 occupations in alphabetical order,
distinguishing the workers who are above and those who are below
20 years of age, but not distinguishing the sexes. Another table
gives the same occupations in classified instead of alphabetical order,
distinguishing the ages to still greater minuteness, and also dis-
tinguishing the sexes. Another table, going as low down in
classification as sub-classes, shows in respect to these the ratio or
percentage of males under 20, males over 20, females under 20, and
females over 20 : this is done with a view of exhibiting, in a broad
and general way, the extent of female labour and of juvenile labour
in Great Britain. Lastly, a fourth table, or rather group of tables,
gives the occupations of the people in all the 13 divisions of Great
Britain, in all the counties, in all the 623 Registration Districts, and
in 89 of the principal towns.
We proceed now to give some idea of the nature of the classification
adopted.
The primary division, it must be understood, is into 17 groups or
classes of persons having definite occupations. These classes,
described in as few words as possible, are as follow ;-


## p. 66 (#166) #############################################

66
Occupations of the People.
1. Her Majesty, the Royal Family; the Houses of Legislature; the
civil servants of the Crown; and persons employed in the local
government and works of the country.
2. Persons engaged in the defence and wars of the country.
3. The learned professions.
4. Persons engaged in the fine arts, in science, and in literature.
5. Wives, widows, children, relatives at home, and scholars.
6. Persons engaged in providing board, lodging, and clothing.
7. Persons who buy, sell, keep, let, or lend money, houses, or goods of
various kinds.
8. Persons engaged in the conveyance of men, animals, goods, and
messages.
9. Persons renting and cultivating land.
10. Persons engaged in catching or employing animals.
11. Persons engaged in certain art and mechanic productions.
12. Persons working and dealing in animal substances.
13. Persons working and dealing in vegetable substances.
14. Persons working and dealing in mineral substances.
15. Labourers and others whose branch of labour is undefined.
16. Persons of rank and property not returned under any office or
occupation.
17. Persons supported by the community, and of no stated occupations.
Many of these classes cannot be rightly understood until the
sub-classes into which they are divided have been examined; and
even then, there are two or three against which grave doubts might be
urged, as to the principle whereon the aggregation has been
determined. Classes 4, 6, and 11 are those here adverted to.
This, however, is a matter on which opinions will inevitably clash i
for, where offices and employments differ one from another by
imperceptible gradations, and where each one may be regarded
under many aspects, no one can determine which is the classification :
we can only adopt a classification, convenient according to the views
of him who makes it. The commissioners, for instance, made class
6 to comprise “people who are principally engaged in lodging,
entertaining, attending, or providing articles of dress, so as to be
brought much into personal contact with those whom they serve.”
This reads well, in so far as it provides a chain of connection among
employments which relate especially to the person ; but the sub-
classes give it an unsatisfactory effect; for we should hardly expect
inn-keepers, coffee-house keepers, eating-house keepers, lodging-
house keepers, domestic servants, inn-servants, undertakers, dress-
makers, shoe-makers, umbrella-makers, rag-gatherers, and washer-
women, to be all included in one class, as they here are. Again ;
class 4 comprises the poet, the historian, the painter, the sculptor,
the musician, the architect, and the natural philosopher, as well as
the professors and teachers of literature and science;" while class
11 comprises “those engaged in the higher class of mechanical and
chemical arts ; they are intimately connected with artists and men
of science, from whom they frequently, either directly or indirectly,
derive materials, direction, or inspiration ; they multiply copies of
original works.” Now this analysis has evidently been much studied
and elaborated by the commissioners; but it leads to strange results
when worked out in detail ; for we find the music-master in one

67
class and the musician in another, the painter in one and the engraver
in the other, the architect in one and the surveyor in the other ;
while publishers, printers, actors, musicians, engravers, carvers,
modellers, showmen, civil engineers, pattern-designers, die-sinkers,
watch-makers, gunsmiths, machinists, coach-makers, saddlers,
shipwrights, builders, wheelwrights, dyers, scourers, calenderers,
and chemical manufacturers, are all thrown together in one class.
The show man, the civil engineer, the publisher, the dyer-here is
an odd grouping! The purpose of mentioning these incongruities is,
not to search out small defects in so grand and valuable an under-
taking, but to illustrate the well-known difficulty of making good .
classifications in lists or catalogues; a difficulty which no one can
measure but those who have tried it.
The 17 classes are divided into 91 sub-classes, rather more than
five to a class on an average. They are as follow :-

The above, it must be remembered, are the 91 sub-classes of
male occupations. The sub-classes of female occupations are not
quite so numerous, and differ a little (but only a little) in designa-
tions.
The 17 classes or 91 sub-classes are further subdivided into no
less than 1,057 occupations or employments, giving an average of about
twelve to each sub-class or sixty-two to each class. These are
occupations for males only; but there is a separate classification for
females, amounting to 746 employments. These are, of course, in
some cases identical with those of men, in other cases nearly alike
but differently named, while in others they are wholly distinct and
feminine in their character. Perhaps the nature of this minute
classification will be sufficiently exemplified by taking three sub-
classes, with all the occupations under each—selecting such as
contain about twenty occupations in each sub-class.—(See page 69.)
The three columns at the head of the opposite page show that the
classification is very minute. Not only is the entire width of a folio
page devoted to each one of the 1,057 male and 746 female occupa-
tions, but the line is divided into 21 sections, each to contain the
number of persons of a particular age in that particular employ-
ment. Seventeen of the sections are for persons under 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or 85 years old
respectively ; one is for persons 85 or upwards, one for all under
20, one for all of 20 or upwards, and one for all ages. Comparisons
can hence be made in many different ways, according to the object
held in view by those who institute them. Thus, taking the humble

grade of a chimney-sweeper, we find that there are 6,641 in Great
Britain ; if we wish to find how many are adults and how many not,
we see it at once in the two entries 4,463 and 2,178, which show
that the climbing-boy system must have undergone great changes,
since there are more than twice as many men as lads employed ;
and if we examine the detail-columns, we find only 188 between
5 and 10 years of age. Again, should we wish to ascertain whether
there are any females who returned themselves in the Census
Schedules as chimney-sweepers, we refer to the analogous division
-the 2nd sub-class in the 14th class—and there we find 91, most of
whom are women from 30 to 60 years of age, probably widows who
are carrying on the business of their deceased husbands.
Taking the 1,057 occupations for males, just as they stand in the
classified tables, the highest numbers are the following, comprising

143,212
Washerwomen and manglers

These numbers, however, must not be used for any inferential
purpose, without taking others belonging to employmients collate-
rally connected with them. Thus, the 401,950 general servants do
not include about 200,000 others who enter themselves under the
more specific designations of housekeeper, housemaid, cook, nurse,
and inn servant; the 202,437 milliners are irrespective of 140,000
seamstresses and needlewomen of other kinds; and so in other cases,
It must also be borne in mind, in respect both to the male and the
female lists, that the highest numbers are attached to designations
which are rather degrees of relationship than occupations. For
instance, we find
Wives (not otherwise specified)
2,631,380
Children and relations at home, ditto
4,745,217
Children who attend school, ditto
2,752,737
Here we have at once more than a third of the entire population
entered under three headings, excluding everything like a business
designation.
As a summary of results relating to occupations generally, without
respect to age, sex, or topographical distribution, it may be profitable
to devote one page to the annexed table (page 71), containing the
Commissioners’own enumeration of the number of persons employed in
108 avocations in Great Britain, comprising all those for or in respect
to which the numbers exceed 10,000: mere domestic relationship,
such as wife,'.' widow,' &c. is not here taken into account; all are
occupations,' in the usual meaning of that word—male or female,
adult or juvenile.
Leaving these general results, which apply for the most part to
the whole of Great Britain, and to the whole circle of occupations,
we proceed to notice a few of the results having a somewhat more
special character. One of these has relation to the employment of
the many by the few, and another relates to farms, farmers, and farm-
labourers.

Occupations of the People.
One of the valuable results of the Census of 1851, is the determi-
nation, to a certain degree of correctness, of the relative positions of
employers and employed; a classification of masters and men in each
occupation. Many of the schedules sent by the Commissioners were
imperfectly filled up; but there is no doubt that the general result
approximates pretty nearly to accuracy. We may solve many
interesting questions by means of the tables thus produced. For
instance, let the question be this—How many occupations are there
in which some of the masters employ 350 hands or more? They are
the following shoemakers, glovemakers, stocking-weavers, engine
and machine makers, builders, carpenters, manufacturing chemists,
tanners, woollen manufacturers, worsted manufacturers, flannel manu-
facturers, woollen dyers, silk manufacturers, ribbon manufacturers,
fancy goods manufacturers, shawl manufacturers, brewers, cotton
manufacturers, lace manufacturers, paper makers, stationers, coal-
merchants, coal-miners, contractors, earthenware manufacturers, glass
manufacturers, silversmiths, tin plate workers, white metal workers,
button makers, iron manufacturers. Let the question be,—which
occupations contain the greatest number of firms employing 350 or
more persons each ? We find, in answer, 113 cotton manufacturers,
21 woollen manufacturers, 13 silk manufacturers, 12 worsted
manufacturers, 14 engine and machine makers, 7 earthenware manu-
facturers, 5 iron manufacturers, 5 builders. Let the question be,-
How many masters employ bodies of men not less than 100 in
number ? The answer, slightly classified, comes out as follows:-
390 masters employ from 100 to 150 men each.
150 to 200
200 to 250
88
250 to 300
65
300 to 350
228
350 and upwards, ,
1142 masters each employ 100 or upwards.
It is in Lancashire chiefly that the factories are situated in which
the largest number of persons are employed. This might be
expected, knowing, as we do, on how gigantic a scale the cotton-
mills of that extraordinary county are conducted. No less than 106
of the Lancashire mills employ more than 350 hands each ; how
much more, is not stated in detail. There are also 10 engineers or
machine makers (the Whitworths, the Fairbairns, &c.), each of
whom has at least 350 work-people.
In London the number of 'work-people employed by the respec-
tive masters differs, of course, from that observable in country lists,
since the preponderant trades themselves differ. Taking 100 as a
minimum, it may be asked, -- which are the London trades com-
prising the greatest number of masters who employ 100 men or more
each ? We find that there are altogether 80 of such masters--a
smaller number than might at first perhaps have been supposed. Of
these, there are 22 builders (of the Cubiti class it may be presumed),
6 engineers, 5 shoemakers, 5 printers, 4 painters and glaziers,
3 pianoforte manufacturers, 2 cach of bookbinders, gunsmiths,

masons, tanners, silk-manufacturers, drapers, tobacco-manufacturers,
stationers, silversmiths, iron-manufacturers, mineral-workers, and
1 each of hatters, tailors, omnibus-proprietors, coachmakers, carpen-
ters, dyers, brewers, sugar-refiners, coopers, brickmakers, gas-fitters,
and cutlers. There are some items which seem to us rather ques-
tionable. For instance, among shipbuilders in the metropolis, there
is not one entered with so many as 50 men in his employ; among
distillers and rectifiers, not one with so many as 20 ;-surely there
must be some omission here? When we find that there are only
2 vinegar-makers, 2 dye manufacturers, 1 law-stationer, entered as
employing any persons at all, it leads us to
suppose
that
many
of the
returns were incomplete.
The small tradesmen in the metropolis are, in many respects, the
most important of all, on account of their large number. The small
chamber-masters, or small shopkeepers who eni ploy each not more
than two journeymen, or two apprentices, or one journeyman and
one apprentice, are surprisingly numerous, showing to how great a
degree mastership is diffused in the metropolis. We give the
following table of chief trades followed by
Masters who employ 1 or not more than 2 Journeymen or Apprentices.
Bakers
Carpenters.
Tailors
Cabinet-makers
255
Butchers
Painters and glaziers
Shoemakers
Grocers
242
The table is to be understood thus,--that in the above eight occu-
pations there are 3,162 masters in the metropolis who employ either
one or two persons each. Of those, still lower in the social scale,
who claim mastership only over their own individual labour, the
numbers run in a somewhat different order, beginning with a shoe-
maker (the ' cobbler who lives in a stall,' perhaps), and going thence
to the tailor, the butcher, the baker, the grocer, the carpenter,
But
these numbers include also those masters who made no definite
returns at all.
In respect to agricultural pursuits, the Commissioners sought to
obtain a return of the number of farms, the size of the farms, and
the number of persons engaged in them. The following is a con-
venient general outline of the result :-

a
Besides the above, there were 2,558 farms of which the sizes were
not stated in the returns ; making 285,936 farms or farm-holdings
altogether. It is found that large farms prevail most in the North,
and in Norfolk and Suffolk. The average size of all the farms is 102
acres; and, taken in the aggregate, they occupy just about one-half
of the territory of Great Britain. Two-thirds of the farms are less
than 100 acres each in extent. About 9,000 small farmers seem to
have no labourers except the members of their own families ; about
170 farmers employ more than 60 labourers each; while all the rest
have in their service a number varying from 1 to 60.
Professional avocations, as distinguished from trading and manu-
facturing, present a few interesting facts, which may be put to-
gether in the following form.
In 1801, the inhabitants of Great Britain, not employed in
agriculture, trade, manufacture, or handicraft, numbered 5,707,017;
out of a total population (with the Army and Navy) of about 11
millions. In a vague sense, therefore, about one-half the population
were supported by independent means or by professional employ-
ments; but this ratio is too indefinite in its character to be relied on
very closely.
În 1811, treating families instead of individuals, there were
presented the following results :-Out of 2,544,215 families in
Great Britain, there were 519,168 not employed in agriculture,
trade, manufacture, or handicraft, or rather less than 1 in 5.
In 1821 there were 612,488 such families out of 2,941,383, or
about the same ratio as before.
In 1831 there were 1,801,168 such families out of 3,414,175, ex-
hibiting the very different ratio of nearly 1 to 3. It is evident that
a different system of classification must have been adopted, to bring
about such a result.
In 1841, under an altered system of enumeration, out of a total
population of about 19 millions, there were
131,464
218,630
In the clerical profession
23,543
In the legal
17,454
In the medical
22,187
In the civil service
16,959
In parochial, &c., offices
25,275
Educated persons following miscellaneous pur-
suits
142,836
In a certain broad sense these may all be considered as professional
persons, numbering in all 598,348, or rather less than 1 in 30 of the
population. These, however, were the individuals actually so en-
gaged; the number of persons supported by them, as family de-
pendents, does not clearly appear.
In 1851, as has been amply explained in former pages, a new
classification was adopted. It is beiter than any before formed, but
still it leaves in a very vague state the question What is a profes-
sional man ?' We may present a few entries here, and leave the
reader to decide for himself whether the employments are professional,
or not:-

Class 11. In the list here given, although artists are included,
engravers are not ; teachers of singing are, but not singers; dra-
matists arc, but not actors. In order, therefore, to make our
enumeration somewhat more complete, we must bring in a few items
from Class 11, still comprising them among “persons engaged in litera-
ture, fine arts, and sciences.

military, effectives and non-effectives, was 262,570.

during the week.

344,464 males and 78,467 females thus occupied. These comprise
1 in 30 of all the males, 1 in 140 of all the females, and I in 50 of
the whole population. · If we omit the sailors and soldiers from the
list of professional men, the ratio becomes about 1 in 60.
Perhaps it will ultimately be found that the most valuable tables
in the Census Reports are those which establish a comparison
between different parts of the country. Large generalizations may
be made from the tables which relate to the whole of Great Britain;
but for comparison and analogy, the sectional tables will have a
peculiar value of their own. In respect to a particular department of
occupation, or a particular social relation, we may wish to know how
far Wales differs from England, and Scotland from both; how far
the 10 Divisions into which England is separated differ one from
another in characteristics ; in what way the 40 English Counties,
12 Welsh Counties, and 32 Scotch Counties exhibit peculiar charac-
teristics ; by what peculiarities the 623 registration districts or poor-
law unions of England and Wales are distinguished; and so forth.
The voluminous Census tables afford a store of information on all
these local details.
Of course, when different districts or portions of the kingdom are
treated separately, the metropol omes in for the first notice; the
following, then, is a rough outline of employments generally in the
metropolis. Confining our attention, at present, to males, and to
males only of 20 years or upwards, we find the following facts :-
That out of the 5,458,815 males of 20 years and upwards in Great
Britain, 632,545 live in the metropolis ; that the London shoe-
makers muster 26,639 strong, and the London tailors, 20,257 ; that
there are no fewer than 25,708 domestic and inn servants ; that the
commercial establishments are so numerous and extensive as to em-
ploy. 15,135 clerks and travellers ; that the coachmen, drivers,
carriers, waggoners, draymen, and others who drive vehicles through
the London streets, number more than 17,000, besides 14,000
messengers and porters, in addition to railway, canal, and river
servants ; that there are, for house-work, 21,174 carpenters, 13,817
painters and glaziers, and 16,038 bricklayers and plasterers; that
among those who supply us with food and drink, are 9,841 bakers,
7,428 butchers, 6,843 publicans, 6,475 grocers, 3,372 milk-sellers,
3,325 greengrocers, 2,238 fishmongers, and 2,156 cheesemongers ;
that the leather trades, chiefly in Bermondsey, employ 5,391 ; that
there are 13,206 persons employed in printing, binding, and selling
books; that the wood-furniture makers and sellers number 13,574;
and that there are more than 40,000 labourers whose branch of
labour is undefined, but who must be distinguished from skilled
artizans.
Let us next, still confining our attention to the metropolis,
glance at the female occupations in a similar way. Among the
5,998,384 females, aged 20 years and upwards, living in Great
Britain, 762,418 are in London. Of this number, 316,517 desig-
nate themselves simply as wives, and 26,627 simply as widows,
and about 40,000 as daughters, without any other alleged employ-
ment. But of those who appear to earn their living by the labour of

77
their own hands or brains, there are no fewer than 118,855 domestic
servants of various kinds, 73,620 needlewomen of various kinds, and
45,754 charwomen, washerwomen, , and manglers. These, with
25,652 annuitants, and gentlewomen of independent means, comprise
all the large items among the female adult population of the metro-
polis: all the other items are, individually, very small. These facts
are not without their instruction ; for they show how limited is the
range of female employments in London. They show, too, that,
after deducting those who are dependent on relations for support,
and those of independent means, there are 330,000 adult females in
London dependent on their own exertions for their daily bread ; and
they show also how large must be the number of families in'com-
fortable circumstances in London, to give employment to nearly
120,000 female servants, and 45,000 laundry and char women.
But now let us compare one of the manufacturing counties of the
North with London, to ascertain how far a different principle seems
to determine the distribution of occupations. Let it be the cotton-
spinning county of Lancashire. Here we have 539,075 males of 20
years of age or upwards, against 632,545 in the metropolis ; that is,
in the ratio of about 85 to 100. Different indeed, however, is the
ratio in respect to employments. We have seen that the metropolis
contains about 26,000 male adult servants, 31,000 drivers and porters,
27,000 shoemakers, 21,000 carpenters, 20,000 tailors, 16,000 brick-
layers, 15,000 clerks, 14,000 painters; whereas, in Lancashire,
these eight occupations exhibit the numbers, 4,708, 9,127, 15,443,
12,146, 11,346, 7,658, 7,643, 6,336—all far below the ratio in
respect to total inhabitants. In London there are 35,000 persons in
the public service, receiving emoluments from the community' at
large ; whereas in Lancashire there are only 11,000. In London
there are 34,000 professional men, engaged in divinity, law, physic,
science, and fine arts; in Lancashire the number is 11,000. In
London there are 14,000 persons employed in writing, printing,
binding, and selling books and periodicals; in Lancashire ihere are
2,000. All these numbers, it is evident at a glance, differ widely ;
London having far more than its ratio of 100 to 85 in each of these em-
ployments. But let us turn the tables, and see what are the employ-
ments wherein Lancashire takes precedence of the metropolis. Or
course, in a county, farmers, graziers, shepherds, gardeners, agri-
cultural labourers, and so forth, must be relatively more numerous
than in a city; and thus we need not be surprised to find 56,000 of
these in Lancashire, against 14,000 in the metropolis. And, con-
sidering the wonderful shipping activity of Liverpool, and the
numerous canals which traverse Lancashire in every direction, we
may be prepared to expect that this county and the metropolis are
not far from equal in the numbers of persons connected with ships,
boats, and barges in various capacities; in the metropolis, this
number is about 21,000, in Lancashire 18,000—very nearly, indeed,
in the ratio of 100 to 85. But it is in textile manufactures, and in
minerals, that Lancashire most decidedly takes the lead before
London. In Lancashire there are 104,000 persons (out of about
540,000) engaged in various departments of the cotton manufacture,

against a few hundreds in London ; 7,000 in woollen manufactures,
against a few hundreds ; 21,000 coal miners and labourers, against
5,000; 3,000 quarrymen, against 500.
Here it must be borne in mind, that the numbers in the preceding
paragraph are of males only, and males too who have reached their
20th year or upwards. A few parallel entries will suffice, relating
to certain occupations for adult females :-domestic servants and
nurses, 125,000 in London, and 55,000 in Lancashire; silk-workers,
8,000 in London, and 12,000 in Lancashire; cotton-workers, 1,000
in London, and 90,000 in Lancashire. Here we find that one-sixth
of all the adult females in London are domestic servants or nurses,
and that one-sixth of all the adult females in Lancashire are engaged
in the cotton manufacture,
There are also striking differences in respect to juvenile labour :-
The metropolis contains 474,013 males, and 493,260 females, under 20
years of age; the numbers in Lancashire are 469,749 and 474,735
respectively. Now in the metropolis, after deducting 770,000 young
persons who are entered only in their domestic or family relations,
without connexion with any particular employments, there remain
about 200,000 who are considered to have some occupation or other ;
whereas in Lancashire there are 270,000 having employment; and
out of this number about 120,000 are employed in the cotton manu-
facture alone—that is, 120,000 young persons. In the metropolis,
on the other hand, young seamstresses and young domestic servants
chiefly fill the list.
Wé turn now to other phases of metropolitan employment. It
may be necessary, in estimating the distribution of occupations in
the metropolis, to bear in mind what are really the limits of the
principal districts into which the Registrar-General has divided it.
Thus there are evidently wealthy families in large number in Ken-
sington, although Kensington parish is not especially aristocratic;
but when we find that Kensington district comprises Kensington,
Tyburnia or the Hyde-Park Square vicinity, Fulham, and Bromp-
ton, it is evident that the district contains a large number of the
private residences of persons who may have professional or business
establishments elsewhere. St. George's Hanover Square district
also includes May Fair and Belgravia, and thence becomes essen-
tially the home of the high-born and their dependents. Lambeth
would be a poor district, if limited to that which is popularly known
by the name; but it is made to comprise Kennington, Brixton,
Norwood, and certain intermediate villages; and thus a different
character is imparted to it. Wandsworth, too, presents itself to the
notice of a passer-by as rather a busy and somewhat dirty manufac-
turing village ; but the district so named includes Clapham, Batter-
sea, Putney, and Streatham, and is dotted over with the suburban
villas of City men. As Sydenham is in district No. 36, and Nor-
wood in district No. 31, the Crystal Palace and park, which are in
those two parishes, are brought by the Registrar-General within
the limits of the metropolis itself. In fine, London, for the purposes
of the Census, has the same limits as for the registration of births,
marriages, and deaths, and comprises 36 districts, situated in the

three counties of Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent. Of these districts,
28 are coextensive with Poor Law Unions, while the remaining 8
consist of parishes in which the Poor Law is administered under
local acts. Such being the limits of the metropolis, we will
notice a few facts relating to the distribution of employments in the
districts.
Of the whole 2,362,236 inhabitants, there are, in round numbers,
630,000 men, 760,000 women, and 970,000 persons of both sexes
under 20 years of age. Of this latter number, nearly 300,000 are
under 5 years of age, and therefore almost equally removed from
schooling and occupation. In order to show, then, how far male
employments are to be met with in London for young persons, we
give the following table in relation to a few occupations :-
Under 20. 20 and upwards.
Law clerks
1,530
5,401
Teachers
457
4,285
Messengers and porters
19,743
13,471
Printers, &c.
3,213
13, 206
Silk manufacturers
1,435
8,388
Cabinet-makers
2,361
13,963
Gold and silver work
1,145
6,419
Brass work
1,066
5,358
Iron work
2,170
13,604
Building trades
6,981
59,451
It is probable that the greater part of the above young persons are
apprentices, although the returns do not specify this fact in words.
The 19,743 young messengers and porters are evidently the “errand
boys,” rather a formidable body in London. Taking female occupa-
tions instead of male, and noticing the difference of age in a similar
manner, we find the following :-
Under 20. 20 and upwards.
Teachers
1,314
11,185
Servants
46,524
138,262
Needlewomen
20, 288
124,165
Silk-workers
2,373
8,847
Paper-workers
625
1,132
If we were to name the three most characteristic kinds of occupa-
tions in London for males under 20 years of age, therefore, they
would be apprentices to mechanical trades, errand boys, and junior
clerks; and for females under 20 years of age, they would be ser-
vants, needlewomen, and teachers.
The 36 districts of London exhibit many remarkable groupings in
respect to employments. It is well known that the members of a
particular trade are wont, in many cases, to congregate near each
other; but the Census tables show this more exactly. Lawyers live
in Kensington district in greater relative numbers than in any other
district-a fact for which we do not feel very well able to account;
but the law clerks, except those who live around Chancery-lane and
the inns of court, are found in greater relative numbers at Islington.
The authors, editors, artists, and architects, are found in small number
south of the Thames, or in the eastern half of the metropolis ;
a

Marylebone, St. Pancras, and Kensington, are their chief districts.
Domestic servants are found in greatest relative force in the districts
of St. George's Hanover Square, St. James's Westminster, Mary-
lebone, and Kensington-indeed overwhelmingly so. The tailors are
strong in St. James's, Marylebone, and St. Pancras, but relatively
more so in the Whitechapel and neighbouring districts, where much
of the slop work is done. The chief districts for shoemakers are
St. Pancras and Marylebone in the north, Lambeth and Newington
in the south, Whitechapel and Bethnal Green in the east. The gar-
deners have Kensington and Wandsworth as their chief districts.
Beyond all other districts, the city is the locality for publishers and
booksellers, for it contains the regions of Paternoster Row, and the
numberless courts around Fleet Street. Musical instrument makers,
for some reason not easily perceptible, congregate in decided pre-
ponderance in St. Pancras. There are two districts in which watch-
makers appear in surprising force; these are, as may be supposed,
Clerkenwell and St. Luke's. Coachmakers in Pancras and Maryle-
bone; shipbuilders in Stepney and Poplar; dyers and calenderers in
Shoreditch and Bethnal Green (where the silk manufacture is carried
on); leather workers in Bermondsey (nearly as many as in all the
other 35 districts combined); sugar refiners, nearly all in Stepney,
Whitechapel, and St. George's in the East; cabinet and furniture
makers, Pancras, and especially Shoreditch ; coopers, in the districts
nearest the various docks; rope and sail makers, Stepney and Bethnal
Green; workers in gold, silver, and precious stones, Clerkenwell;-
these are the chief a-sociations between occupations and districts.
And so, in like manner, are there certain occupations for adult
females, which seem to be carried on in some districts rather than
others. Domestic servants and governesses are, relatively to the
population, most numerous in the districts of Kensington, Maryle-
bone, and St. George's Hanover Square; while schoolmistresses, as
distinguished from governesses, are relatively as numerous in other
districts. The charwomen are especially numerous in Marylebone.
Those who assist in the hat manufacture, binding, and so forth, are
in Southwark and Bermondsey, where most of the hat factories are
situated. The women tailors, who make waistcoats and cheap goods
for the slop shops, are chiefly in the three eastern districts of Stepney,
Whitechapel, and St. George's in the East. The milliners, as dis-
tinguished from seamstresses, are in greatest number in Marylebone
and Pancras; but the seamstresses, who are understood to occupy a
lower grade among needlewomen, are in strongest force in Stepney
and St. George's in the East. Staymakers are in Marylebone chiefly.
The washerwomen and manglers take up their abode chiefly in the
genteel districts. The women who work at shoemaking live prin-
cipally in Shoreditch and Bethnal Green ; while the umbrella makers
are more generally to be found in Whitechapel and St. George's in
the East. The hawkers and pedlars are chiefly in the four districts
just named. Artificial flower-makers in St. Pancras; silk workers in
Bethnal Green ; upholstery workers in Marylebone ; lace workers
in the same district-these are other examples of predominance.
For reasons stated in the early part of this paper, will be impos-

şible to give abstracts of the county and district tables here; so
numerous are they, and to so great a length is the classification
carried. But we may be able to select a few examples sufficient 10
illustrate broad general principles of industrial distribution. For in-
stance, every one knows that certain towns have become celebrated
for certain manufactures ; Sheffield for cutlery, Birmingham for small
metal works, Manchester for cotton, Leicester and Nottingham for
hosiery, Leeds for woollens, Bradford for stuffs, and so on ; but it
may be useful and instructive to know more exactly the extent to
which this localization is carried. Again, there may be certain dis-
tricts containing no very large towns, but in which some particular
manufacture is nevertheless carried on to a remarkable extent; such
as straw-plait, pillow-lace, needles, and many others.
Passing in review the principal cities, boroughs, and towns, we
can readily determine from the tables, even without the aid of any
previous knowledge on the subject, the prevailing character of the
industry in each town, and to some extent the degree in which
female labour and juvenile labour are made use of. Let us take a
few of the towns in succession.
Birmingham.- Here the males under 20 years of age are 52,640,
and above 20 years 61,276; the females under 20 are 53,380, and
above that age 65,545; or, placing the numbers in a compact table,
we have the result thus:-
Males. Females. Total.
52,640 + 53,380 = 106,020 under 20 years.
61,276 + 65,545 = 126,821 20 and upwards.
113,916 + 118,925 = 232,841 total population.
Now in respect to their population, we find that out of the various
classes of occupations, classes 11 and 14 are those in which the
Birmingham inhabitants are chiefly employed—viz., working in
metal. 2,000 men making guns, 1,800 making machines and tools,
2,400 working in gold and silver, 3,000 brass founders, 1,400 button
makers, 1,200 white and black smiths, 1,400 iron manufacturers, 400
nail makers. These are among the men of 20 years and upwards;
but of the males under this age there are no less than 7,000 em-
ployed in the few metal trades above enumerated. In Birmingham,
females are largely enployed in the smaller kind of metal manufac-
tures; for example-1,300 young females and 1,600 adult females
making buttons ; 700 and 1,100 in miscellaneous works in mixed
metal ; 800 and 1,200 in miscellaneous iron and steel works.
Manchester and Salford—In these cotton towns are
Males. Females. Total.
86,551 + 89,043 = 175,594 under 20 years.
104,906 + 120,821 = 225,727 20 and upwards,
191,457 + 209,864 = 401,321 total population.
These are within the parliamentary limits, wbich exceed the
municipal. Now passing over the tailors and shoemakers, the
carpenters and painters, the bakers and butchers, who in all large

towns must necessarily form a considerable part of the population,
we turn to class 13 as likely to exhibit remarkable characteristics of
the workers in Manchester and Salford. Here one single entry,
cotton manufacture, comprises enormous numbers—13,257 men,
5,692 boys, 14,503 women, 9,051 girls, making a total of 42,503, in
which the females exceed the males by 23,554 against 18,949.
Putting the whole of the textile manufactures together-relating to
cotton, fax, silk, and wool, they appear to employ about 25,000
men, 8,000 boys, 20,000 women, and 12,000 girls, exhibiting the
remarkably near equality of 33,000 males to 32,000 females—more
than 1 in 7 of the entire population of Manchester and Salford
employed in making the textile materials for dress, besides 12,000
tailors and seamstresses employed in making up textile materials into
dress. We have in this paragraph, for brevity, applied the names of
boys and girls to young persons under 20 years of age; and shall do
so in those which follow.
Nottingham.—Here we enter a bobbin net and cotton stocking
town :-
Males. Females. Total.
11,782 + 12,746 = 24,528 under 20 years.
14,805 + 18,074 = 32,879 20 and upwards.
26,587 + 30,820 = 57,407 total population.
Of course the numbers in any particular occupations here will
appear much smaller than in Manchester, because the population is
only one-seventh as large; but the following entries are well worthy
of note :stocking-makers, 2,469 men, 412 boys, 1,588 women, 474
girls, making nearly 5,000 persons, or more than one-twelfth of the
whole of the inhabitants, employed in this one branch alone. The
bobbin-net manufacture employs 1,376 men, 517 boys, 3,277 women,
1,902 girls, exhibiting a still more striking total of more than 7,000
persons. Of the aggregate 12,000, more than 7,000 are females. It
is worthy of notice that the hose and lace workers bear a larger
ratio to the population of Nottingham, than the whole of the textile
workers bear to the population of Manchester.
Merthyr Tydvil.-We quit hosiery and lace, to attend to iron and
coal :-
Males. Females. Total.
14,357 + 13,628 = 27,985 under 20 years.
19,650 + 15,443 = 35,093 20 and upwards.
34,007 + 29,071 = 63,078 total population.
Now in this remarkable town we glance over the classes of occupa-
tion, one after another, without meeting with any numbers so large
as to arrest the attention. At last, however, in class 14, we encounter
them in surprising force. There are under the heading coal miners,'
1,671 boys and 4,302 men; and among iron workers are 2,038 boys,
and 6,915 men; making a total of about 15,000 workers in these two
minerals alone; these, with 700 or 800 females similarly employed,
comprise a quarter of the entire population. Considerably more than
half the adult male population of Merthyr Tydvil are workers in

iron and coal, employed chiefly in the four great establishments of
Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Pen-y-darren, and Plymouth works.
Bradford.—This busy Yorkshire town introduces us to a wholly
different class of manufactures. The parliamentary borough is some-
what extensive, and includes some of the neighbouring villages,
comprising a population of
Males. Females. Total.
22,934 + 24,399 = 47,333 under 20 years.
27,032 + 29,413 = 56,445 20 and upwards.
49,966 + 53,812 = 103,778 total population.
After making allowance for the large number of tailors, shoe-
makers, carpenters, masons, and similar handicraftsmen for supply-
ing the wants of so large a population, we find that class 12
contains the employments characteristic of Bradford.
Here are
entered, under worsted and stuff manufacture, 5,381 boys, 10,759
men, 7,936 girls, and 8,780 women—a powerful body of about
33,000 persons (nearly a third of the whole population) employed in
worsted and stuff manufactures alone. The woollen cloth, the silk,
and the cotton manufactures, occupy perhaps 1,000 altogether,
showing how insignificant they are at Bradford.
Leeds.—The borough contains-
Males. Females. Total.
38,468 + 38,987 = 77,455 under 20 years.
45, 246 + 49,569 94,815 20 and upwards.
83,714 + 88,556 = 172,270 total population.
We devote a short paragraph to Leeds, for the purpose of showing
how remarkable a contrast may be presented in the industry of two
towns situated only about ten miles apart. Bradford and Leeds
both work up wool largely; but Bradford prepares it for stuff or
worsted fabrics, while Leeds prepares it for woollen cloth. Leeds
has 2,920 boys, 7,640 men, 1,710 girls, and 2,624 women, employed
in making woollen cloth ; while the stuff and worsted manufactures
barely employ 1,000. Leeds, however, is a large manufacturing
town in other respects; for it employs about 9,000 persons in the
flax manufacture, and 3,000 in making engines and machines.
Relatively to the population, Huddersfield is perhaps more pecu-
liarly associated than Leeds with the woollen cloth manufacture.
Macclesfield.—Having given an idea of the distribution of occupa-
tions in the towns which may he regarded as the chief seats of the
cotton, woollen, and stuff manufactures, let us do the same in respect
to the silk-workers of Macclesfield borough:
Males. Females. Total.
8,299 + 8,735 = 17,034 under 20 years.
10,242 + 11,772 = 22,014 20 and upwards
18,541 + 20,507 = 39,048 total population.
There are 2,462 boys, 4,772 men, 2,979 girls, and 4,339 women,
employed in the silk manufacture, making an aggregate of about

=
14,500 persons, considerably more than one-third of the entire
population. The males and females are employed in almost exactly
equal numbers, 7,234 to 7,318.
* Sheffield.—In this cutlery borough there are-
Males. Females. Total.
31,108 + 31,112 62,220 under 20 years.
36,392 + 36,698 = 73,090 20 and upwards.
67,500 + 67,810 = 135,310 total population.
In the classes relating to the supply of food, clothing, and dwellings,
Sheffield contains a number fairly proportionate to its population ;
but it is only in class 14 that the industrial characteristics make
their appearance. The works in gold, silver, steel, iron, and mixed
metals, employ about 20,000 men and boys at Sheffield. Females
are very little employed in the metal trades, thereby presenting a
striking contrast to the arrangements at Birmingham. No fewer
than 2,461 boys, and 7,044 men are employed in making and grind-
ing cutlery and files alone.
Glasgow.—There are two or three Scotch towns which pre-
sent remarkable characteristics. Glasgow has-
Males. Females. Total.
71,474 + 73,593 145,067 under 20 years.
83,455 + 100,574 184,029 20 and upwards.
154,929 + 174, 167 329,096 total population.
This busy city is worthy of note for the degree in which it combines
cotton working and iron working, two departments of industry which
certainly do not seem to have any very necessary bond of connexion.
There are 3,449 boys, 11,371 men, 9,692 girls, and 16,442 women
-about 15,000 males and 26,000 females-employed in various
branches of the cotton manufacture. Of all the females in Glasgow,
in every age and condition, one in seven are employed in this manu-
facture. There are, in respect to metal trades, 2,600 machine and
tool makers, 4,800 miners and manufacturers, and 5,400 other
workers in metal-almost wholly males.
Dundee. This is the great centre of the flax and linen manufac-

Of these numbers there are 2,713 boys, 6,16) men, 4,300 girls, and
6,568 women, employed in fax and linen manufactures, being almost
exactly one-fourth of the whole population—a ratio which must
certainly appear surprisingly large. Aberdeen is also engaged in
these trades, but in a very much smaller ratio than Dundee.
These few examples would perhaps suffice to illustrate the distri-
bution of particular branches of manufacture in the principal towns ;
but, adopting a still more compressed torm, we will give a few
additional instances in the following way

At Portsmouth, out of about 35,000 men and boys in the borough,
about 9,000 are in the public service, and receive pay from the com-
munity ; while there are about 2,000 privately employed as seamen
or as shipwrights. At Leicester, out of 60,000 persons, nearly
9,000 are employed in making worsted stockings, and similar articles.
At Northampton, out of 13,000 men and boys, more than 4,000 are
employed in making boots and shoes, the staple industry of the
place; and at Stafford the men and boys similarly employed are in
the ratio of 1 to 4 of the whole male population. At Worcester, out of
15,080 women and girls, 2,133 are employed in making gloves.
Of the 25,705 men and boys in Wolverhampton, about 7,500 are
employed upon metals or upon coal; no less than 1,400 make locks
alone. In Dudley the ratio is about as high, about 6,000 out of
19,093. Coventry is remarkable for two trades, about as diverse as
any two can be, ribbon-making and watch-making: out of a popu-
lation of 36,612, nearly 10,000 persons (of whom 6,500 are females)
are employed upon silks and ribbons; while 1,700 men and boys are
making watches. At Stockport, 17,000 persons are employed in
cotton manufactures, out of a total population of 53,835—ncarly one
in three ; at Blackburn, 16,000 out of 46,536——more than one in
three ; at Bolton, 14,500 out of 61,171 ; at Old m, 20,000 out of
72,357 ; at Preston, 18,000 out of 69,542. Thus, in these five
cotton spinning and weaving towns, containing an aggregate of about
300,000 inhabitants, about 34,000 males, and 42,000 females-c011-
siderably more than one-fourth of all the inhabitants—are engaged
in this manufacture. Looking at the distribution of workers in
respect to age, we find that there are about 33,000 children and
young persons under 20, and 43,000 adults of 20 and upwards. In
Paisley, out of about 31,000 inhabitants, nearly 9,000 are employed
in various kinds of textile manufacture, of which the principal is
shawls.
Hitherto, in the above paragraphs, we have spoken of distinct
towns, each with defined limits and defined number of inhabitants.
But a few remarkable manufactures are centred rather in districts
than in large towns.
In Staffordshire, the registration' county (which often differs both
in limits and in population from the real county, but never to any
very great extent) contains 320,903 males and 309,641 feniales.
Now it is plain, on a little examination, that the main departments
of industry whereby these are supported have relation to mineral
manufactures ; and it is further observable, on comparing the several
districts in Poor Law Unions, that while the southern exhibit the
inetallic and colliery operations, the northern are associated with
earthenware manufactures. In short we have the Wolverhampton
region of the south, and the Pottery region of the north. There are
27,000 males and 1,000 feinales engaged in various departments of
the coal trade ; 45,000 males and 7,000 females in metallic manu-
factures ; 16,000 males and 9,000 females in pottery and earthenware
manufactures. It is worthy of note that in the two districts or Poor
Law Unions of Stoke-upon-Trent and Wolstanton, containing
the pottery towns of Stoke, Hanley, Lane End, Delph, Etruria,
a

Occupations of the People.
Shelton, Burslem, &c., out of a population of 51,000 adult males
and females, more than 13,000 are engaged in the earthenware
manufacture. And in respect to South Staffordshire, it would perhaps
scarcely be expected that 5,000 women are engaged in nail-making.
Bedfordshire, containing 62,539 males and 67,266 females, is not
a county likely to contain large manufacturing establishments of any
kind ; but there are, nevertheless, two or three entries in the tables
which deserve attention. There are, we find, 2,300 males and more
than 10,000 females engaged in the straw-plait manufacture;
together with nearly 6,000 females occupied in hand-lace making.
One fourth of all the females in the county, of all ages and con-.
ditions, are employed in one or other of these two occupations.
In Buckinghamshire, containing 70,928 males and 72,727 females,
the straw-plait trade is smaller, employing only about 3,000 females ;
but the lace-trade is about as extensive as in Bedfordshire, employing
nearly 11,000 females. In Hertfordshire we almost entirely lose the
lace-trade ; but the straw-plait employs about 9,000 females out of
87,497. In Cambridgeshire there is a little done in these two trades,
but only a little ; and in Huntingdonshire there are about 1,000
females out of 30,295 engaged in the lace-trade. In these two
departments of cottage industry, the females employed are of all
ages from 5 to 90, chiefly between 10 and 20.
Worcestershire, for some reason which it is difficult to explain; is
the centre of the needle manufacture. At Redditch in this county
nearly all the inhabitants are supported, directly or indirectly, by
this manufacture; although the steel for making the needles, and
all the coal for heating the steam-engines, must be brought from
other quarters.
Cornwall is well known to be a mining county; and this certainly
appears in the Census returns. There are 172,193 males in this
(registration) county; and among these are 3,000 seamen, and 2,600
fishermen : but when we come to class 14, mineral working, we
find about 16,000 copper-miners, more than 10,000 tin-miners,
2,500 lead-miners, and about 6,000 employed in other ways on metals
and minerals; none, however, in coals: a significant consequence of
the absence of coal seams in the stratifications of that county. There
are also about 6,000 females engaged at the above-ground' works :
of the copper and tin mines.
But now let us turn to a county containing much coal but little
metal. Durham (registration) county contains 207,088 males, and
204,591 females, a departure from the general rule ; for here we find
more males than females. Now here are 10,000 men and boys
engaged in sea and river navigation: a very large number out of
such a population, and evidently due principally to the navigation of
colliery vessels. The number of 4,500 ship and boat builders is
also large, and points to the busy trade of Sunderland. But a much
larger item is that of 29,000 men and boys employed in coal-mining
and working, about one-seventh of the male population. In
Northumberland, as might be expected, a somewhat parallel state of
things presents itself. There are here 149,515 males; and, of these,'
about 6,000 are engaged in navigating ships and boats, 1,400 in

building ships and boats, and 11,000 coal-miners; the parallelism,
it will be observed, is in the nature of the prevalent occupation, and
not in their extent, for Durham greatly takes the lead in this respect.
Five of the coal-miners of Northumberland are entered as being up-
wards of 90 years of age ; but it is satisfactory to find that, con-
sequent on recent legislation, scarcely any boys under 10 years of
age, or females of any age, are included among the coal-miners or
labourers,
There are two counties in the western part of the kingdom
which we may similarly, notice, in respect partly to the iron manu-
facture, but still more decidedly to coal-mining. These are Mon-
mouthshire and Glamorganshire. Monmouthshire contains 92,301
males and 82,849 females—another example, in a mining county, of
the males outnumbering the females. The iron trades occupy
12,000 males, and the coal trade also 12,000—in round numbers :
together more than one-fourth of the entire male population.
Females are not much employed in these trades in this county:
Glamorganshire, containing the remarkable towns of Merthyr and
Aberdare and their vicinity, has a population of 125,087 males and
115,000 females. Of these males, no less a number than 15,500 are
engaged in the coal trade, and 14,000 in the iron trades. In another
Welsh county, Carmarthen, copper manufactures are, in respect to
the population, if not as remarkable as iron manufactures in Glamor-
gan, at least worthy of note as the staple industry of portions of
the country. The explanation of this is, that nearly all the copper
ores of Cornwall and Devon are sold on the spot to copper-smelters,
who have their works at Swansea or Neath, or some other town in
Carniarthenshire. But besides the copper workers there are, among
the 125,087 males in this county, 14,000 workers in iron, and
15,000 coal-miners.
Something has been said, in former paragraphs, of the remarkable
distribution of employments in the cotton and woollen towns of the
north ; and a comparison, in relation to ain items, has been
made between Lancashire and the metropolis. In order, however,
to illustrate more definitely the centralization of certain manufactures
in the two great counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire (West Rid-
ing), we will present, in the following form, certain numbers and
ratios. In Lancashire, out of 1,008,824 males of all ages, there are
160,000 engaged in the various departments of the cotton manufac-
ture ; and out of 1,058,477 females, about 158,000 similarly engaged ;
and of this large total of 318,000, not less than 118,000 are under
20 years of age. In the West Riding of Yorkshire, out of 666,912
males of all ages, there are about 120,000 engaged in various de-
partments of wool and worsted manufactures ; and out of 673,139
females, about 80,000 similarly engaged ; and of this total of 200,000,
about 15,000 are under 20 years of age. In comparing the above
numbers, we observe the following results :—that the male
workers in wool bear a larger ratio to the whole male popula-
tion in the West Riding, than the male workers in cotton
bear to the whole male population of Lancashire ; that in respect to
female workers, the ratio lies in the other direction; that the ratio of

juvenile workers to adult workers is about the same in both depart-
inents of industry; and that while ? in 6 of the Lancashire popula-
tion are engaged in cotton manufactures, about 1 in 6 of the West
Riding population are engaged in the wool manufactures.
Such are a few of the more striking results obtained by the
Census, relating to the Occupations of the People. The entire
Report is worthy of the most careful study of every person who
desires to know something more of the Condition of the People,
in this hardworking country, than can be derived from vague
generalizations and partial inquiries.

THE LEGISLATION, STATISTICS, PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS,
AND CHRONICLE OF 1854.
VII.-ABSTRACTS OF IMPORTANT PUBLIC ACTS,
PASSED IN THE SECOND SESSION OF THE SIXTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND,
ASSESSED TAXES AMENDMENT ACT.
[17 Victoriæ, cap. 1.-February 17, 1854.]
An Act to explain and amend an Act of the last session, relating to the
Duties of Assessed Taxes ; and to authorise Justices of the Peace in
Ireland to administer oaths required in matters relating to Income Tax.
The Act amended is the 16 and 17 Vict., cap. 90, and by $ 1 it is
declared that the duties contained in Schedule F of that Act (the duties
payable for horses and mules not charged under Schedule E) are to
be deemed to have been granted and made payable thereby; and the
exemptions ($ 2) granted under Schedules E and F are to extend only
to the duties granted in Schedule E, except where such horses or
mules are kept for husbandry purposes only. Horses used by common
carriers occasionally conveying passengers ($ 3) are to be charged only
under Schedule F. The time (§ 4) for giving notice to determine
compositions is extended to April 5, 1854. The oaths (8 5) required
the Acts relating to the income tax may be administered by justices
of the peace in Ireland, as well as by the Income Tax Commissioners,
COASTING TRADE.
[17 Victoriæ, cap. 5.—March 23, 1854.]
An Act to admit Foreign Ships to the Coasting Trade.
In § 1 the clauses in the 16 and 17 Vict., cap. 107, forbidding the
carrying of goods or passengers from one British port to another are
repealed; but power is retained for Her Majesty to exercise retaliatory
restrictions, as in the previous Act. By § 2 foreign ships employed in
the coasting trade are subjected to the same rules as British ships ;
and such foreign ships (§ 3) are not to be subject to higher rates for
pier, harbour light, pilotage, or other dues or tolls, than British ships,
or to any restriction as to the employment of pilots, or to any other
rules whatever, than what British ships are subjected to. Foreign
steam-vessels ($ 4) carrying passengers coastwise are to be subject to
the provisions of the Steam Navigation Act, 1851 (14 and 15 Vict.,
cap. 79).

[17 Victoriæ, cap. 10.—May 12, 1854.]
An Act for granting to her Majesty additional Duties on Profits arising
from Property, Professions, Trades, and Offices.
By § 1 of this Act there is granted for the year commencing April 6,
1854, in respect of all property, profits, and gains charged for the said
year, with the rates and duties granted by cap. 34 of last session, addi-
tional rates and duties amounting to one moiety of the whole of the
duties thereby chargeable; the whole amount to be paid with and over
and above the first moiety so charged; the said duties ($ 2) to be

Act is superseded by cap. 24.]
MILITIA.
[17 Victoriæ, cap. 13.-May 12, 1854.]
An Act to amend the Acts relating to the Militia of the United Kingdom.
The first section provides that the militia may be embodied whenever
a state of war exists. By $ 2 it is enacted, that, after a corps of militia
has been called out, the time of training may be extended, but not so
as to exceed the period of fifty-six days; but where (§ 3) the regiment,
or any part of it, may have been sent to head-quarters, or attached to
any corps of the regular forces for purposes of instruction, such time is
not to be reckoned in the fifty-six days. ,Notice of the time and place
of meeting ($ 4) is to be sent by post to the residences of the men as
stated in their attestations, and such delivery to be deemed sufficient;

THE PRIZE ACT, RUSSIA, 1854.
[17 Victoriæ, cap. 18.—June 2, 1854.]
An Act for the Encouragement of Seamen, and the more effectual Manning
of Her Majesty's Navy during the present War.
This is a long Act, but the more interesting clauses are (after de-
claring in the preamble that general reprisals having been granted
against the ships, vessels, and goods of the Emperor of all the Russias,
and his subjects, Her Majesty has been pleased of her munificence to give
the benefit of all prizes taken during the present war to the captors
thereof being in Her Majesty's service), $ 5, by which all ships and goods
taken by Her Majesty's ships, and adjudged as prizes, are to be divided
according to Her Majesty's proclamation; bụt when any ships of an
allied power are acting in conjunction, a share is reserved for them;
and arms, stores, &f., (6) taken in any fortress, or ships or goods in
any river or creek defended by a fortress, are to be divided as other
prizes; and, where, acting in conjunction with land forces ($ 7), the
ships are to have such proportional share as Her Majesty may appoint.
Naval stores ($ 8) found on board foreign ships may be purchased by
the Admiralty for the public service. British ships and vessels recap-
tured (§ 9) are to be restored on payment of salvage, unless they have
been sent forth and used by the enemy as vessels of war; and, if re-
captured ($ 10), before being sent to an enemy's port, they may, with
the consent of the re-captors, be allowed to prosecute their voyage. A
bounty of 51. per head is to be paid ($ 11) for every prisoner taken
serving on board an armed ship of the enemy. The following clauses
relate to the adjudication of prizes, the prosecution of appeals, and the
proceedings in the Admiralty courts, &c.
The next Act (cap. 19), the "Nayal Pay and Prize Act,” is to much
the same purport; but it provides that the Admiralty, by order in
council, may alter the mode of paying the navy, and distributing the
prize money,
INCOME TAX. (No. 2.)
[17 Victoriæ, cap. 24.- June 16, 1854.]
An Act for granting to Her Majesty an increased Rate of Duty on Profils
arising from Property; Professions, Trades, and Offices.
By § 1 there is granted from and after April 5, 1854, in lieu of the
rates granted by cap. 34 of the preceding session, and of cap. 10 of
the present session, the sum of fourteen pence in the pound on the annual
amount of all such gains, profits, and property; the duty ($ 2) is to be
assessed and raised under the provisions of the previous Acts; the
interest on exchequer bills ($ 3) to be charged up to April 5, at the
previous rạte, and the interest subsequent to that date to the increased
rate; provided always ($ 4) that where any less rate than 7d. was im-
posed by the previous Acts, or any abatement allowed, such rate or
abatement shall be made in the same proportion to the rate of 1s. 2d.
granted by this Act. (The effect of this clause is, that all assessments
as imposed by the preceding Acts are in every case doubled by this.]
Copies of the poor-rates in Ireland ($ 5) are to be transmitted to the
Commissioners of Inland Revenue only when required [previously they
were to be transmitted regularly every year).. The Act ($ 6) is to take
effect from April 5, 1854, to be in force during the present war, and
until April 5, next after the ratification of a treaty of peace; and if this

happen before April 5, 1859, then the rates imposed by this Act are to
cease, and the rates imposed by cap. 30 of the preceding session to be
revived and paid so long as the period for which they were granted by
that Act shall remain unexpired. The previous Acts ($ 7) are to con-
tinue in force for the recovery of arrears, &c.
EXCISE DUTIES.
[17 and 18 Victoriæ, cap. 27.-July 3, 1854.]
An Act for granting certain udditional Rates and Duties of Excise.
By $ 1 certain additional duties are granted upon malt, namely, by
Schedule A, for every imperial bushel of malt, which, after May 8, 1854,
shall be made in England, or imported into England from Scotland or
Ireland, without a certificate of having paid the local duty, the sum of
4s, shall be paid; and for every bushel made in Scotland or Ireland,
for home consumption there, the sum of 3s. 1d. ; and for every bushel
of malt in possession of any one for sale, the additional duty of 1s. 3.4d.,
except such malt be in Scotland and Ireland for home consumption
there, and made from bear or bigg, then the sum of 1s. And for every
gallon of spirits, distilled after May 8, in Scotland, the additional sum
of 1s. 4d. (4d. is given in Schedule C, to commence from May 26), and
in Ireland of 81.; and for every gallon of spirits exported from the
Channel Islands into Scotland, the duty of 7s. 2d. (Ad. is added by
Schedule C.), and if into Ireland, of 5s. 2d., in lieu of the present duties.
On spirit mixtures there is imposed, on ether imported from Scotland
into England, a duty of 4s. id. per gallon ; from Ireland into England,
9s. 7d.; and from Ireland into Scotland, 58. For sweet spirits of nitre,
other enumerated tinctures, &c., and spirit varnishes, from Scotland
into England, 2s. 9d.; from Ireland into England, 5s. 9d. ; and from
Ireland into Scotland, 3s. For other tinctures and medicated spirits,
from Scotland into England, 1s. 10d.; from Ireland into England, 3s. 10d.;
and from Ireland into Scotland, 2s. 10d. For made wines, from Scot-
land into England, 2fd.; from Ireland into England, 54d.; and from
Ireland into Scotland, 3d. For sugar used in the brewing of beer, for
every cwt. from May 10, the duty of 58. 2d. in lieu of previous duties.
The drawback on exportation is the same as the duties. The Act (§ 2)
is to last only till July 5, next after the ratification of peace. The
duties (§ 3) are to be under the management of the Commissioners of
Juland Revenue, and collected as heretofore. Maltsters, and every other
trader using malt (§ 4), are to give an account of all malt in their pos-
session on May 8; and maltsters to give a return of all malt made and
disposed of by them within a month previous, with the names of the
persons, and certain particulars of the sale, under a penalty of 1007., or
40s. for every bushel of malt, at the election of the Attorney-General ;
the additional duty on the stock in hand to be payable on July 5, 1854,
unless security is given, when the payments may be made by instal-
ments ending on January 24, 1855, and failure in payment incurs a
penalty of double the amount of duty charged, or 1001. at the election
of the Attorney-General. Officers of excise ($ 5) may enter the pre-
mises of maltsters, &c., to take an account of malt in stock, and the
penalty for not suffering them to do so, or for molesting them, or for
clandestinely removing malt uncharged, is 1001., or 40s. for every

arrangements for receiving and forwarding traffic, and for the return
of carriages, trucks, boats, and other vehicles, without unreasonable
delay, and without subjecting any particular person or company, or

continuance of such violation of the Act, and enjoining obedience to
the same, and, in case of disobedience, may order the payment of such
sum, not exceeding 2001. per day, for every day after a fixed date
during which they continue to disobey, such sums to be paid either

tion of the residence and occupation of the person giving the same, be
filed within twenty-one days after the making thereof, with the clerk
of the docquets and judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, in like
manner as warrants of attorney. Any defeasance or condition of
trust ($ 2) not contained in the body of the bill of sale must be written
on the same paper or parchment before filing, or the bill of sale
becomes void." The officer of the Court of Queen's Bench (§ 3) is to
keep a book containing the particulars of each bill of sale according to
a form prescribed, which book may be searched at all reasonable
times on the payment of 6d. ; an index is also to be made and kept,

a memorandum of sắtisfaction to be written upon any such bill of
sale or copy. In the interpretation of terms ($ 7) is defined what
constitutes a bill of sale; and defines personal chattels to mean goods,

any unlawful game shall be found in any house, room, or place
suspected to be used as a common gaming-house,” it shall be evidence
that such house, room, or place, is used as a common gaming-house; and
" whereas the keepers of common gaming-houses contſive, by forti-
fying the entrance to such houses, or by other means, to keep out the
officers authorised to enter the same until the instruments of gaming
have been removed or destroyed, so that no sufficient evidence can be
obtained to convict the offenders :" it is enacted ($ 1) that any person
obstructing the entry of any constable or officer authorised to enter a
suspected gaming-house, by bolting, barring, or chaining up any
external or internat door, or in any other way delaying the entry of

place being a common gaming-house. Any person ($ 3) apprehended
in such place who shall give to the officers or justices a false name or
address incurs a penalty not exceeding 501., or imprisonment for any
term not exceeding one month. Any person ($ 4) keeping a house or
place for purposes of gaming, or having the care or management, or
assisting in conducting the business, or advancing or furnishing
money, is subject to a penalty not exceeding 5001., or imprisonment
for any term not exceeding twelve months. The justices ($ 5), before
whom any persons are brought found in such houses, may require
them to give evidence upon oath touching any unlawful gaming, or as
to any obstruction offered to the entry of officers, and they are not to
be excused on the ground of criminating themselves, but on refusing
to be sworn are to be treated as other persons appearing in court on a
summons or subpæna may by law be dealt with; such person, how-
ever ($ 6), on making a full discovery to the best of his knowledge of
all things as to which he is examined, shall receive a certificate from
the judge of the court which shall free him from all criminal prose-
cutions, penal actions, and all penalties, forfeitures, and punishments
whatever, and in any action or proceeding brought against such person,
such proceeding shall be stayed on the production
of the certificate.

convicted is committed to prison instead of payment of the penalty,
then the costs alone to be levied by distress. 'Of the penalties recovered
($ 8) one-half is to be paid in aid of the poor-rate of the parish in
which the offence has been committed, and the other half to the
person laying the information. If any person has laid an information
(§ 9), and afterwards neglects to prosecute such information with due
diligence, the justices may authorise some other person tù proceed.

for any proceeding under this Act unless notice be given to the
intended defendant one month at least before prosecuting the same,
and within three months after the act or omission complained of. The
Act ($ 15) came into operation on August 1, 1854.

In § 1 it is provided that the terms “ Parliamentary Burgh" shall
mean a burgh or town in which magistrates and councils were pro-
vided by the 3 and 4 Wm. IV., cap. 77; that “occupiers of premises
shall mean a male occupier of a house or other heritable subject of the
yearly value of 101., unless when let as a furnished house for a less
period than a year, in which case it shall mean the party by whom the
house is let. By $ 2 so much of the Act of last session, cap. 101, as
relates to Scotland is repealed, but not to affect anything already done
under that Act. The short title of this Act (3) is to be “The Public
Libraries Act (Scotland), 1854.' Upon the requisition in writing
(§ 4) of the magistrates and council of any town of which the popu-
lation exceeds 10,000, by the last census, the chief magistrate is to
summon a meeting to consider the propriety of adopting this Act in
the town, or in such part thereof within which it may be proposed to
adopt this Act; the summons is to be issued within ten days of
receiving the requisition, and the meeting is to take place within not
less than twenty-one days nor more than thirty; and fourteen days'
notice, on the church doors, is to be given of the meeting. The quali-
fication for voting ($ 5) is to be the occupation of a house of the yearly
value of 10l., but companies or partners may vote for every iol. of
yearly value. Unless a poll be demanded by five persons in writing
(8 6), the Act may be adopted at the meeting by a majority of two-
thirds. If a poll be demanded ($ 7), it is to be taken in one day, from
9 A.M. to 4 P.M., when the state of the poll is to be ascertained and
declared; but a majority (88) of two-thirds is still necessary for its adop-
tion. For defraying the expenses of the meeting, and for taking the
poll ($ 9), an assessment may be levied, not exceeding ld. in the pound,
on the yearly value of all premises within the town. The accounts
of the magistrates and councils ($ 10) in relation to this Act are to
be open to the inspection of all persons liable to assessment without any
fee, and the officer having care of such account who shall refuse the
inspection of such account, or shall prevent extracts from being taken,
is liable for every offence to a penalty not exceeding 5]. The boun.
daries of burghs, &c. ($ 11), are to be those defined in the 13 and
14 Vict., cap. 33. Lands or buildings ($ 12) may be purchased or

rented for the purposes of this Act; and all the clauses ($ 13) of The
Lands Clauses Consolidation Act (Scotland), 1845,' relating to the
purchase of lands by agreement, are incorporated with this Act; or
ſands or buildings ($ 14) may be exchanged for the like purposes.
The general management ($ 15) is to be vested in the magistrates and
councils, as well as the property of the lands, library, &c.; and the
admission (S 16) to all libraries and museums established under this
Act are to be open to the public free of all charge.
REFORMATORY SCHOOLS (SCOTLAND).
[17 and 18 Victoriæ. cap. 74.-August 7, 1854.]
An Act to render. Reformatory and Industrial Schools in Scotland more
available for the benefit of Vayrant Children.
Any young person apparently under fourteen years of age found
begging or wandering without visible means of subsistence, though not
charged with any actual offence, may be brought ($ 1) by any constable
or police officer before any sheriff or magistrate, who, unless the parents
or some other persons become surety for the good behaviour of such
young person in a sum not less than il. nor more than 51., shall forth-
with send such young person to a reformatory or iudustrial school for
such period as may appear necessary for his or her education, but not to
be detained without their own consent beyond the age of fifteen. Any
young person (§ 2) absconding from the school to which they have been
sent before the age of fifteen, and refusing to return, may, on complaint
before a magistrate, be summarily punished, by whipping and imprison-
ment, for a term not exceeding twenty-one days; and any person ($ 3)
directly or indirectly withdrawing, or knowingly concealing or harbour-
ing any such young person from the school, is liable to a penalty not
exceeding 5l. ; or, failing payment, to imprisonment for any time not
exceeding sixty days. The treasurer or other officer of the school to
which a child may be sent is empowered ($ 4) to sue the parents or
step-parents in the Sheriff's Small Debts Court for payment of the cost
of support and other expenses; but where the cost cannot be recovered
from the parents ($ 5) the expense is to be paid by the parochial board
of the parish on which the child would have been chargeable as a pauper
in the first instance. The directors and managers ($ 6) of such schools
and institutions are empowered to make all necessary rules and bye-laws
with the sanction and approval of the Lord Advocate of Scotland; and
the Education Committee of the Privy Council ($ 7) are enabled to grant
aid to the directors and managers of such schools for the purpose of
erecting buildings, all schools or institutions receiving such aid to be
open to the examination of Her Majesty's inspector of schools. This
Act ($ 8) is not to interfere with the powers of removal possessed by
parishes under the 8 and 9 Vict., cap. 83.

($ 2) are to continue until January 1, 1857, and may be prolonged by
the Privy Council if thought fitting, until January 1, 1858; and her
Majesty (8.3) may fill up any vacancy happening within that time.
The Commissioners are empowered ($ 4) to require from any officer of
the University, or of any College or Hall, the production of any docu-
ment or accounts, and any information relating to the revenues, statutes,
usages, and practice thereof, and no oath to be pleadable in bar of the

term, 1854 (8 5), the hebdomadal council of the university is to cease,
and on the 15th day a new council to be formed as follows, with all the
powers, privileges, and functions of the present board. The new heb.
domadal council ($ 6) is to consist of the chancellor, vice-chancellor,
the provosts, six heads of colleges or halls, six professors of the univer-
sity, and six members of convocation of not less than five years' standing;
the head of a college or hall, being also a professor, may be elected as
å professor, or a professor may be elected as a member of convocation,
but if elected in both capacities he must declare upon first taking his
seat in which capacity he desires to sit, and his other seat to be forth-
with declared vacant; the council to meet ($ 7) for the dispatch of
business on the 15th day of Michaelmas term, 1854. Of the six persons
($ 8) to be elected out of each of the classes of heads of colleges, pro-
fessors, and members of convocation, the three juniors of each class in
academical standing shall vacate their seat at the end of the third year;
the others at the end of the sixth year; but such persons (§ 9) are
eligible for re-election. Casual vacancies ($ 10) by death, resignation,
or otherwise are to be filled by the election of other qualified persons,
who are to take the position of the person causing the vacancy. If
the vice-chancellor ($ 11) be not also an elected member, he is to con-
tinue a member of the council until the next triennial election, or for
one year if the election take place earlier. No professor (§ 12) to be
ineligible by reason of anything contained in the statutes of his founió
dation. Any member ($ 13) who shall reside less than twenty-four
weeks during term time in any one year is to have his seat declared
vacant at the year's end. The vice-chancellor (§ 14) is to make and
publish, before Sept. 25, 1854, a register of the members of the con-
gregation, and also the regulations of the hebdomadal council for the
election, return, and resignation of the members, for keeping the

by the Commissioners, or, after the expiry of the Commission, passed
by licence of the Crown; the congregation to have power to frame
regulations for its own proceedings. Every statute framed by the heb-
domadal council ($ 17) shall, after due notice of the contents thereof,
be promulgated in congregation and proposed for acceptance or rejec-
tion after an interval of seven days, and, if accepted, after an interval
of fourteen days be submitted to convocation for final adoption or re-
jection; but power is given to the university to modify the intervals by
statute if they choose. Amendments in writing (§ 18) may be proposed
by any member of congregation to the hebdomadal council, which the
council are to consider, and may adopt, alter, or reject; but if any
change (§ 19) is made in any statute after promulgation, it must be pro-
mulgated afresh. The members of congregation ($ 20), on occasion of
the promulgation of any statute, may, subject to the regulations of the
university for the due order of debate, speak in English, but without
the power of moving any amendment. In the election of members for
the hebdomadal council, every person entitled to vote may give ($ 21)
for one vacancy one vote, for two or three vacancies two votes, for four
vacancies three votes, for five or six vacancies four votes, but no elector
to give more than one vote to one candidate. The powers of the con-
vocation ($ 22) are retained, save as herein provided. At any election
of a chancellor ($ 23) the university may provide by statute if they
think fit, that votes may be given by proxy. Oaths (ş 24) not to dis-
close any matter or thing relating to his college, to resist or not concur
in any change of the statutes, to do or forbear from doing anything the
doing or not doing of which would tend to any such concealment, resist-
ance, or non-concurrence, are declared illegal, and none such are
hereafter to be administered or taken. Thc vice-chancellor ($ 25) is
empowered to license members of convocation to open their residences,
if within a mile and a-half of Carfax, for the reception of students who
shall be matriculated, and admitted to all the privileges of the univer-
sity, without being entered as members of any college or hall; every
such person ($ 26) to be called a licensed master, and his residence a
licensed hall. The university ($ 27) are empowered to make statutes
before the first day of Michaelmas term, 1855, in order to carry into effect
the objects purposed in relation to the private halls; and by the same
date ($28) the various colleges and halls may amend statutes with respect
to the eligibility to headships, fellowships, and other college emoluments,
and the tenure thereof, to insure the same being conferred according
to personal merits and fitness (subject to the approval of the Commis-
sioners), but without prejudice to any existing interests; and if any
college omit to make such statute, the Commissioners ($ 29) are em-
powered to make such orders or regulations as they deem proper,
such orders to be laid before the college and the visitor thereof two
calendar months before being submitted to her Majesty in Council,
when, if two-thirds of the governing body shall, in writing and under
seal, declare that in their opinion such ordinances will be prejudicial
to the college as a place of education, the same shall not take effect ;
but the Commissioners may submit other rules and regy tions for the
like purposes.
Power is given to the University. ($ 30) in cases of any
gift or endowment of more than fifty years' standing, to alter or modify
the trust where it may appear to them that the interests of religion
and learning would be advanced by so doing, subject to the approval of
the Commissioners and of her Majesty in Council, The right of
preference ($ 31) of certain schools in elections to offices of emolu,
ment in the University, such as fellowships, scholarships, &c, are not

to be abolished, if, within two calendar months after receiving notice
of such intended abolition two-thirds of the governing body of the
school to be affected, or if the Commissioners under the Charitable
Trusts Act, 1853, shall dissent therefrom; the notice (§ 32), if served
in writing on the principal of such school, to be deemed a sufficient
notice. All ordinances and regulations ($ 33) framed by the Com-
missioners, and objected to by the governing body of the college or
school to which they relate, are to be transmitted forthwith to one of
the Secretaries of State, and laid before Parliament. Winchester
College (9 34) is to be subject to the provisions of this Act. Ordi.
nances, regulations, and statutes (835) made by any college and approved
by the Commissioners, are to be laid before the Queen in Council
within two months of the passing of the same, and be published in the
Gazette, but within one month of such publication any college, or the
visitor thereof, may petition her Majesty against the approbation
thereof, and the petitioner may be heard by council against it. All
such regulations, ordinances, and statutes ($ 36) are to be laid before
Parliament, and if not petitioned against within forty days, the Queen
may signify her approbation, and the same shall become law, but if the
Queen disapprove of the whole or part, the Commissioners are to frame
others. The powers granted to colleges ($ 37) are also granted to the
University in relation to halls and private halls, subject to the like
confirmation, but such powers to cease on the first day of Michaelmas
term, 1855, and if the University have then omitted to frame such
statutes or ordinances as may, in the opinion of the Commissioners,
be sufficient for the objects of this Act with respect to existing halls
and the establishment of private halls, it shall be incumbent on the
Commissioners to do so, and lay the same before her Majesty in Council.
The Commissioners ($ 38) are to have regard to the wants and improve-
ments of the college or hall, the advancement of religion and learning,
the establishment of the professoriate on an enlarged basis, and the
delivery of lectures where the college is able to make such provision.
All statutes made by the University or colleges ($ 35) are subject to
repeal or alterations by the proper authorities, as are also ($ 40) those
made by the Commissioners. The cathedral of Christ Church (§ 42) is
to be considered a college for the purposes of this Act. Persons ($ 43)
becoming members of any college after the passing of this Act not to
be considered as possessing an existing interest within the meaning of
this Act. After the first day of Michaelmas term 1854 no oath is to be
taken or declaration made on matriculating; nor ($ 44) on taking the
degree of B.A. The University Court (8 45) is henceforth to be subject
to the rules of the common and not the civil law, and rules are to be
made for its proceedings by three of the judges of the superior courts in
conformity with those of the county courts. The stamp duties ($ 46)
on matriculation and degrees are to be abolished so soon as provision
has been made by the University to the satisfaction of the Lords of the
Treasury, in lieu of the moneys heretofore voted by Parliament. The
powers of the University ($ 47) are to remain as heretofore, except as
modified by this Act. $ 48 is an explanation of terms.

STAMP DUTIES.
[17 and 18 Victoriæ, cap. 83.—August 10, 1854.]
An Act to amend the Laws relating to the Stamp Duties.
This Act is for altering certain Stamp Duties, the effect of which is
sufficiently shown by the new scale given in the schedule, which we
subjoin. It is only necessary further to give the more material enact-
ments not indicated in the schedule. By § 4, bills purporting to be
drawn abroad are to be so deemed, though drawn in the United Kingdom,
and are chargeable with duty accordingly; and the holder of a bill
drawn out of the United Kingdom ($ 5) is to affix an adhesive stamp of
the proper amount before negotiating it, and the neglect to do so, or to
cancel the stamp, incurs a penalty of 501. Bills purporting to be drawn
in sets ($ 6) must be so drawn under a penalty of 1001. Unstamped
drafts on bankers ($ 7) are not to be circulated beyond fifteen miles
from the place where payable, under a penalty of 50l. ; but drafts ($ 8)
lawfully issued unstamped, may be circulated at any distance by affixing
and cancelling the proper stamp. Stamps ($ 10) denoting the duty of
qne penny may be used for receipts or drafts without regard to their
special appropriation. All bills, drafts, and notes ($ 12), except Bank
of England notes, are rendered liable to the stamp duty. The exemp-
tion from the stamp duty ($ 13) of letters acknowledging the receipts
of bills, promissory notes, &c., is repealed; but receipts for money paid
to the Crown are still exempted. The stamp duty on pawnbrokers'
licences in Dublin ($ 20) is reduced from 151. to 71. 10s. Instruments
liable to stamp duty ($ 27) are to be admitted in evidence in any
criminal proceeding although they be not stamped. The Act is to be
in force from Oct. 10, 1854.

YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS.
[17 and 18 Victoriæ, cap. 86.-August 10, 1854.]
An Act for the better Care and Reformation of Youthful Offenders in
Great Britain.
After reciting that reformatory schools for juvenile offenders have
been established by voluntary contributions in various parts of Great
Britain, and that it is expedient that more extensive use should be
made of them, it is enacted (1), that the Secretary of State for the
Home Department shall, on application from the managers of any such
institution, direct one of the inspectors of prisons to examine and report
upon its condition and regulations; and any such institution as shall be
certified by him as useful and efficient for its purpose shall be held a
reformatory school under the provisions of this Act; but the inspector
is to visit and report from time to time, and upon his report the Secre-
tary may, if he think proper, withdraw the certificate. When any person
(§ 2) under sixteen years of age shall be convicted of any offence
punishable by law, before a magistrate or two justices in England or
Scotland, in addition to the sentence passed as a punishment for his
offence, he may be sent, at the expiration of his sentence, to some one
of the reformatory schools, and there detained for not less than two nor
more than five years, provided his sentence has not been for less than
fourteen days' imprisonment; but the Secretary of State may
any
time order the discharge of such offender. The Lords of the Treasury
(§ 3) are empowered to defray the cost of maintenance at such reforma-
tory school, at a rate per head, to be determined by them, or such por-
tion of the same as shall not have been recovered from the parents of
the offender. Any juvenile offender ($ 4) absconding or refusing to
conform to the rules, is to be punished with hard labour in some gaol
for any period not exceeding three months, as the magistrate before
whom he may be brought shall determine. The cost of maintenance
($ 5) is to be charged by the Court on whose order any such juvenile
offender is detained upon the parent or step-parent, if of sufficient abi-
lity to bear the same, to an amount fixed by the Court, but not to ex-
ceed 5s. per week, such payment to be in relief of the charge on her
Majesty's Treasury, and the amount so fixed ($ 6) is to be recovered
under the provisions of previous Acts for similar purposes. The Secre-
tary of State ($ 7) may direct the removal of any juvenile offender from
one reformatory school to another. The Act ($ 8) does not extend to

statutes ($ 4) relating to the standards of gold remain in full force, and

at great length. It declares every person guilty of an offence, subject-
ing them to fine and imprisonment, who shall, directly or indirectly,

imprisonment, and all persons convicted of such offences (8'6) are to
be struck out of the registry of voters, and their names to be inserted
in a separate list. No cockades or other marks of distinction ($ 7) to
be given at elections under a penalty of 21., and all payments for such,
or for flags, banners, or bands of musie, to be deemed illegal payments

during an election. The penalties under this Act (§ 9) are to be
recoverable in all cases by suit by any person who may sue for them

($ 18) is to be made except through the election auditor. The can-

ments except through the election auditor, subjects himself to heavy
penalties. The tender or offer to pay any claims by the election
auditor ($ 15), or a payment into court in case of an action, to be taken
for all purposes as that of the candidate. Nothing in this Act ($ 20)
is to limit the right of a creditor to bring an action against a candidate
for expenses connected with the election; but if a final judgment is
obtained against the candidate, a copy of the judgment and a statement
of payments made in satisfaction is to be sent to the election auditor
forthwith ; but no candidate ($ 21) is to be allowed to compound or
confess judgment in any such action without the consent of the election
auditor. The candidate ($ 22) is to pay his own personal expenses and
for advertisements, but an account of the sums spent in advertising is to
be furnished to the election auditor. The giving of refreshments ($ 23)
to voters on the days of nomination or voting are declared illegal, and
subjects the offender to a penalty of 40s. for every case. The remain-
ing clauses chiefly relate to the duties and payment of the auditor,
except $ 36, which enacts that any candidate found guilty of bribery
shall be incapable of being elected or sitting in parliament during the
parliament then in existence. The Act is to continue in force for one
year, and to the end of the then next session of parliament,

An Act for the further Amendment of the Process, Practice, and Mude of
Pleading in and enlarging the Jurisdiction of the Superior Courts of
Comnion Law at Westminster, and of the Superior Courts of Common
Law of the Counties Palatine of Lancaster and Durham.
This, the last Act of the session, is long and important, but as it is
in a considerable degree professional, we shall only have occasion to
notice its objects so far as they have general interest. By $ 1 it is en--
acted that parties, by consent in writing, may enable the judge to
decide upon questions of fact without the intervention of a jury, his
judgment to have the same effect as the verdict of a jury, and not to be
questioned on the ground of being against the weight of evidence. By

whenever, after the issuing of the writ, it shall be shown that the mat-
ter in dispute is one of account, wholly or in part; and several of the.
succeeding clauses relate to proceedings in cases of arbitration. On
the trial of a cause ($ 18), the party who begins, in case the opposing
party does not announce the intention of adducing evidence, is allowed
to address the jury a second time to sum up the evidence; the opposing
party is also allowed to open the case, and sum up the evidence, and
the right to reply remains as heretofore. All persons called as wit..
nesses ($ 20), satisfying the judge that they have conscientious objec-"
tions to taking an oath, may be allowed to give evidence on making an
affirmation in a prescribed form; and a false affirmation ($ 21) subjects

tion of a witness for felony or misdemeanour may be adduced to the
Court. Comparison of disputed writing ($ 27) with writing proved to
be genuine may be made by witnesses. Documents requiring stamps
produced in Court ($$ 28 and 29) that are unstamped or insufficiently
stamped, may be received upon payment of the penalty and duty to an
officer of the Court. By § 48 any person refusing to make an affidavit
which may be required in any civil action, may be summoned before the
judge in order to be examined. In an action for the detention of any
chattel ($ 78) the Court, upon the application of the plaintiff, may order
execution to issue for the return of the chattel detained, instead of de-
fendant being allowed to retain it on payment of the value assessed.
In actions on bills of exchange, &c. ($ 87) which may happen to be lost,
the loss is not to be pleaded if an indemnity be given to the satisfaction
of the judge. The Act comes ($ 104) into operation from October 24,
1854; and by $ 105 her Majesty is empowered by Order in Council to
extend all or any part of the provisions of this Act to any Court of Re-
cord in England and Wales, to which (§ 107) the Act is confined.

Abstracts of Parliamentary Documents.
VESSELS Built.-In 1853 there were 798 vessels built and registered
in the United Kingdom, of which the tonnage was 203,171, an increase
over 1852 of 56 ships, and a tonnage of 32,747. The number of Colo-
nial-built vessels registered in British ports in 1853 was 32, the tonnage
26,443. The number of Foreign-built vessels so registered was 102,
and the tonnage 30,073. In the year 1853, 581 vessels were wrecked,
and 84 broken-up, of which the total tonnage was 125,935.
STEAM VESSELS.—The total number of Steam Vessels of every de-
scription that were on the register in the United Kingdom between
January 1, 1852 and January 1, 1854, was 1375, of the aggregate
burthen of 248,623 tons, giving an average of 181 tons, though it in-
cludes all the river passenger boats. 1826 is the oldest date of regis-.
tration.
BRITISH FISHERIES.—The Commissioners' Report for 1853 states
that in the year 908,800 barrels or cravs of Herrings had been taken,
and 778,039 barrels cured, an increase over 1852 of 279,252 barrels.
The number of barrels branded was 248,136 ; the quantity exported was
342,630 barrels. Of Cod and Ling 61,230 cwts. were sold fresh, 105,596
cwts. were cured dry, and 5122 barrels cured in pickle; 22,650 cwts of
the dry were exported, but only 14 barrels in pickle. In 1853 there were
10,974 boats employed, with 41,045 men and boys; the tonnage of the
boats was 74,752 tons, and the value of boats, nets, and lines, was
547,0251. The tonnage employed in carrying salt from Liverpool
amounted to 28,021 tons, the hands to 2,167; in exporting the cured fish
41,240 tons of shipping were employed, with 3,414 hands. All the
items, except the cod in pickle, show an increase over the preceding
year. The Commission, though called that of British Fisheries, is in
reality Scotch only: all the returns are confined to Scotland and the
Isle of Man.
EXPORTS OF PRODUCE, IRELAND. - In the year ending January 5, 1854,
there were exported from Ireland to Great Britain 180,785 oxen, &c.,
5,281 calves, 224,550 sheep, 101,396 swine; 74,197 quarters of wheat,
and 1,542,579 quarters of oats. To foreign parts there were exported
530 cwts. of bacon and hams, 472 barrels of beef and pork, 17,944 cwts.
of butter, 2298 quarters of wheat, 10,338 quarters of oats, 6508 gallons
of Irish spirits; 28,741 yards linen, and 8401. entered at value; 536 lbs.
of linen yarn ; 646,876 yards, and 5541. entered at value of cotton manu-
factures. Of the live stock exported to England the returns are from
non-official documents. The following are the numbers of cattle, &c.,
for the preceding three years :-

AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.-A return of the Exports and
Imports to the Australian Colonies, including Van Diemen’s Land and
New Zealand, for 1851, 1852, and 1853, show some curious results. The
exports for 1853 exhibit a decline, sometimes an extinction, in almost
every article, except wool, and, of course, excepting the gold, which is
pot noticed in the return. For all articles which can be consumed in the

Colonies the large immigration will satisfactorily account; thus, tan-
ner's bark, of which 35,894 cwts. were exported in 1852, was reduced 'to
4,776 cwts in 1853; and tanned hides, of which 642,198 lbs. were ex-
ported in 1852, only amounted to 9,842 lbs. in 1853; while untanned
hides rose from 30,243 cwts. in 1852 to 41,987 cwts. in 1853 ; and hoofs
of cattle from the value of 5101. to 8411. Undressed sheepskins rose
from 26,120 in number to 40,838; while of tanned, of which 13,048 were
exported in 1852, not one was sent away in 1853. Tallow declined
from 159,333 cwts. in 1852 to 125,206 cwts. in 1853; cocoa-nut oil from
10,713 cwts. to 8,331 cwts.; train and spermaceti oils from 2,121 tuns to
946 tuns. Flax and hemp, guano, wine, timber, tortoise-shell, whale-
fins, &c., all declined or disappeared from the return.
and lead ore; but copper partly wrought, that is, in bars, rods, or
ingots, increased from 373 tons in 1852 to 686 tons in 1853, a somewhat
curious exception. Quicksilver fell from 14,631 lbs. in 1852 to 6,933 lbs.
in 1853, which is easily understood; and wool rose from 43,197,301 lbs.
in 1852 to 47,075,963 lbs. in 1853.
The total amount of Imports, the produce and manufacture of the
United Kingdom, into all the Colonies, was 2,807,3561. in 1851; in 1852
the amount was 4,222,205l. ; and in 1853 it was 14,506,5321. The
increase was proportionately large in foreign and colonial merchandise
exported from the United Kingdom. The number of ships cleared
from the United Kingdom in 1851 for the various Australian Colonies
was 272 in 1951, 568 in 1852, and 1201 in 1853; the amount of tonnage
was 145,164, 335,717, and 553,088 in the three years respectively.

The returns, however, though each for twelve months, are not for
precisely the same periods: the county-rate year extends to Michaelmas
1852, while the land tax is for the year ending April 5, 1852. In the
poor's rate, the amount raised from land, including farm-houses, was
2,707,6271.; from tithes and rent-charges, 295,056l. ; from saleable
underwoods, 28,5241. ; total from land, 3,063,8741.; the remainder is
from houses, factories, mines, canals, railways, &c. On the whole, the
land contributes 4,877,0441.; trade and manufactures, 5,797,9121.
Church rates are not included in the parliamentary return, because no
summary had been made, and they would necessarily have been very
incomplete.
LUNATIC ASYLUMS.- In the year 1853, the total amount received on
account of CounTY AND BOROUGH LUNATIC ASYLUMS was 358,038l.; of
which 250,2131. was on account of pauper patients, 12,215l. for private
patients, and 32,8601. from the county and borough treasurers for build-
ings, repairs, &c. The total expenditure in the year was 330,928l.; the
chief items being—for provisions, 131,9321.; for necessaries, &c.,
30,9871.; for clothing, 17,118l.; for surgery and dispensary, 4,9991. ;

METROPOLITAN PARKS.-Since 1830 there have been formed or added
to, at the public expense, the following parks or public grounds :-
Primrose Hill, 60 acres, at a cost of 23,4421. ; Kennington Common,
18 acres, at a total cost of 3,554l., of which 8001. is to be raised by local
contribution, 2001. paid by the Duchy of Cornwall, the remainder
granted by Parliament; Victoria Park, 220 acres, at a cost of
129,7181. 2s. 9d., but this cost includes about 45 acres retained for
building purposes, and let as part of the land revenues of the Crown;
Battersea Park, 319 acres, at a cost of 222,0791. np to March 31, 1854,
but about one-half the ground is to be retained for building purposes,
and appropriated towards defraying the cost of the undertaking.
British MUSEUM.—In the year ending March 31, 1854, the total
expenditure was 54,0341. The number of visitors to the Museum in
1853 had been 661,113. Of visits to the reading-room for study or
research, there were 67,794, and each reader consulted on an average
six volumes per day. The number of volumes added to the library was
14,397. The visits to the galleries of sculpture by artists for purposes
of study were 6,518, and to the print-room 3,928.
HARBOURS OF REFUGE.- For the construction at Dover of a pier at
Cheeseman's Head, 800 feet long, the estimate was 265,0001.; this has
been nearly completed under contract, but an extension is contemplated.
For Harwich the works were chiefly the removal of shoals and the
repair of the Breakwater; the estimate was 110,000l.: the works under
the old contract are completed, but 15,0001. are yet required for the
removal of other shoals not included in the original estimate.
At Alderney and Jersey the works are very extensive : the estimates
for the two places are 1,580,0001., and the works are to be completed in
eight years. At Alderney the Northern Breakwater will be completed
in the course of 1854, and the foundation of the Western Breakwater
has been laid. At Jersey, also, great progress has been made with the
Verdut Breakwater, and other portions of the works.
For the Harbour of Refuge and Breakwater at Portland, the estimate,
including the purchase of some land and quarries, was 588,9591. ;
upwards of 400,000l. have been expended; and on March 31, 1854, :
1,010,923 tons of stone had been deposited, and the Breakwater is
advanced to a distance of 3,302 feet from the original shore-line, and
shelters a considerable extent of deep water. Vessels have already been
able to avail themselves of the protection thus afforded.

IX. CHRONICLE OF THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, 1854.
[17–18 Victoriæ.]
(LORDS.). Parliament was opened by the Queen, who in the
Jan. royal speech expressed regret for the failure of her endea-
31. vours, made in conjunction with the Emperor of the French for
the settlement of the differences between Russia and Turkey,
and announced a further augmentation of the naval and military
forces. Her Majesty then dwelt upon the patience with which the
privations consequent upon the failure of the late harvest had
been borne by the poor; placed in juxtaposition with this calamity,
the prosperous state of the commerce of the country, the large increase
in the imports and exports, and the excess of the revenue over the ex-
penditure; and recommended to the consideration of parliament a Bill
* for opening the Coasting Trade of the United Kingdom to the ships
of all friendly nations." The principal government measures of the
coming session were then briefly stated in programme--namely, Bills for
effecting improvements in the system of education, pursued at the Uni-
versities of Oxford and Cambridge ; a plan for improving the system
of admission to the civil service; Bills for transferring testamentary
and matrimonial causes from the ecclesiastical to the civil courts, and
for giving increased efficiency to the superior courts of common law; a
bill for relaxing the law of settlement which at present “ impedes the
freedom of labour;” and Bills " for checking bribery and corrupt prac-
tices at elections, and giving more complete effect to the principles of
the Reform Act of the last reign.
The Address in answer to the Royal Speech was moved by the Earl of
Caernarvon, and seconded by the Earl of Ducie. A long debate fol-
lowed, in which the Marquis of Clanricarde criticised the foreign
policy of the Government, which he characterised as secret, vacillating,
and unsuccessful. The Earl of Clarendon defended the Government,
which was warranted, he said, in protracting negotiations, rather than
commit the country to the terrible alternative of war. The Earl of
Derby promised his support of any measure having for its object to stop
bribery and corruption, but would strenuously resist every contrivance
by which the balance of representation should be still further turned
against the landed interest. The debate then turned upon the charges
of interfering in the foreign policy of the country made by certain
newspapers against Prince Albert : on this subject explanations were
given by the Earl of Aberdeen, Viscount Hardinge, the Earl of Derby,
and Lord Campbell.
(COMMONS.) Lord Castlerosse moved and Mr. T. Hankey seconded
the Address. The debate which followed was similar to that in the
upper house, Lord J. Russell defending the foreign policy of the
Government, and triumphantly refuting the calumnies against the
Prince Consort.
Feb.
(COMMONS.) Mr. Brotherton made his usual motion to
1.
prevent the bringing on of any new business after midnight;
after a discussion the motion was rejected by 84 to 54.
Feb.
(Lords.) A discussion between Lords Lyndhurst, Claren-
don, and Beaumont upon the subject of the Vienna Note

for Barnstaple, Cambridge, Canterbury, Hull, Mallow, and Tynemouth,
was stayed till the 9th of March. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
obtained leave to bring in a Bill to explain and amend the Assessed
Taxes Act of last session; the Bill was read a first time. In Com-
mittee on the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer moved a resolution on which to found a Bill
submitting to Parliament the estimates of the expenses for collecting
the Revenue, along with the other estimates of the year. Hitherto the
expenses of collection of the revenue, and various other charges, were
defrayed out of the receipts before they came into the Exchequer, and
without the supervision or control of Parliament. The motion, which
originated in a promise made by Mr. Disraeli, when in office, would
bring, as stated by Mr. Williams, no less than between six and seven
millions under the control of the house. The resolution passed with
unanimous assent.
Feb.
(COMMONS.) In Committee on Merchant Shipping and
3,
Pilotage, Mr. Cardwell, in an explanatory speech, moved for
leave to bring in two Bills, one for opening the Coasting
Trade, and the other for consolidating and amending the various laws
passed for the benefit of British Shipping. The proposition was
received with satisfaction by the Committee, and after a short debate
agreed to.
Feb.
(COMMONS.) Lord Palmerston stated, in answer to questions,
that militia forces would be organized in Scotland and Ireland.
6.
Lord John Russell, in reply to Lord Jocelyn, stated that the
Russian Ambassador had intimated his intention to retire from the Court
of St. James's. The noble Lord then asked the House to go into com-
mittee, in order to consider the oaths taken by members in either House
of Parliament before taking their seats. After an able historical review
of the causes for framing the present oaths, the noble Lord stated in
terms the oath which he proposed should be taken by all members of the
House, Protestant, Catholic, or Jew. The effect of the words of the
present oath
on the true faith of a Christian,” in excluding Jews from
Parliament, was shown to be most unjust, both from the circumstances
of the original introduction of those words, and from the broad and clear
language used by Baron Alderson on the bench, and by Lord Lyndhurst
in the Upper House. The noble Lord, in conclusion, intimated that, should
the Legislature maintain the oaths, it would then be for the House of
Commons to consider whether or not it had the right to decide what
form of oath ought to be taken by its own members. After a speech
from Sir F. Thesiger, the House went into Committee, and a resolu-
tion on which to found a bill was agreed to. The House having resumed,
the Assessed Taxes Act Amendment Bill was read a second time, and a
Select Committee appointed to try a petition against the return of Mr.
John Sadleir for the borough of Sligo.
Feb.
(COMMONS.) Mr. Butt brought before the attention of the
7.
House the charges made against the Irish members of the House
at a public dinner in Tuam of Dr. Gray, and moved for a Com-
mittee of Privilege to inquire and report upon the matter complained of.
The motion was agreed to.
Feb. (Commons.) Sir W. Heathcote took the oaths and his seat
8. for Oxford University in room of Sir R. H. Inglis.
Feb.
(COMMONS.) Mr. T. Chambers moved for a Select Com-
9.
mittee to investigate certain claims against the Portuguese
Government; which motion was opposed by Lord J. Russell,
but carried by 126 against 74. Mr. Cayley then moved for a Select
66

Committee to consider the expediency of attachingsalary and office to
the Leader of the House of Commons. Sir C. Wood opposed the motion,
and moved the previous question. Mr. Walpole also opposed the.
motion, but commented upon the unconstitutional position now occupied
by Lord J. Russell, and cited some historical incidents in support of his
views. Lord J. Russell combated the conclusions drawn by Mr. Walpole
from the historical precedents he had adduced, but admitted as a
general principle the inconvenience of separating the leadership of the
House from official responsibility. Mr. Cayley then withdrew his
motion,
Feb.
(LORDS.) The Earl of Fitzwilliam having asked a question
respecting the object of Count Orloff's mission to Vienna,
10.
received an explanation from the Earl of Clarendon, who
subsequently stated, in reply to the Earl of Ellenborough, that in case of
war Sweden and Denmark had given assurances of perfect neutrality.
Earl Grey having asked whether the new Reform Bill would be
brought into the Commons' House on the 13th instant, received an
affirmative answer from the Earl of Aberdeen; whereupon the Earl of
Derby expressed his regret that Government should persist in bringing
in a measure which might disturb the unanimity of the country at a
critical time.
(Commons.) Lord J. Russell, after considerable discussion, obtained
leave to bring in two Bills—one to invigorate the laws against bribery,
treating, and undue influence at elections; the other to amend the laws
relating to trials of election petitions and to inquiries into corrupt
practices. Mr. Baines obtained leave to bring in a Bill to amend the
laws relating to the settlement, removal, and chargeability of the poor
in England and Wales, and explained that the measure would make the
right to relief depend not on settlement but destitution; that it would
at once abolish the compulsory removal of paupers, enlarge the area of
rating and chargeability, and gradually equalize the rates.
Feb.
(Commons.) Lord J. Russell developed the principles of his
promised Reform Bill, of which the leading points were—1st.
13.
The disfranchisement of small boroughs containing less than
300 electors or 5,000 inhabitants : 2. To subtract one member each from
places with less than 500 electors or 10,000 inhabitants. To distribute
the 62 seats thus vacated he proposed that—3. The West Riding of
Yorkshire and South Lancashire should be severally divided into two
electoral districts returning 3 members each (making 8 new members);
that all counties and towns having more than 100,000 inhabitants should
return 3 members instead of 2, forming an addition of 47 members (9
for boroughs, 38 for counties); that Birkenhead, Barnsley, and Staley-
bridge should be created boroughs returning one member each; that
Kensington and Chelsea should form a new electoral district, returning
2 members; that an additional member should be given to Southwark;
that the inns of court should return 2 members, and the London and
Scotch Universities one each: 4. To make provision for the representa-
tion of minorities in districts returning 3 members by giving each elector
two votes only, so that any section, comprising not fewer than 2-5ths of
the gross electorate, would secure the return of their candidate : 5. With
regard to the franchise, all who receive a salary of 1001. a year paid
quarterly, or 101. a year in dividends; all who paid 40s. a year to the
income or assessed taxes; graduates of universities; and all who
possessed 501. in a savings' bank for three years uninterruptedly, should
have the privilege of voting in county or borough elections: 6. The
reduction of the borough franchise to a 61. rating: 7. The abolition of

the right to vote by freemen (as such) after the expiration of existing
interests: and 8. The repeal of the regulation under the statute of Anne,
by which a member vacates his seat on accepting a Government office.
A long desultory conversation followed, at the close of which the noble
Lord obtained leave to bring in two bills to effect the changes just
sketched.
Feb.
(LORDS.) A discussion on the Eastern question originated
14.
by the Marquis of Clanricarde moving for more information re-
specting the cessation of diplomatic relations with the Court of
St. Petersburg, The Earl of Clarendon defended the Government against
the attack of the noble Marquis. The Earls of Ellesmere, Malmesbury,
Grey and Derby, Lord Glenelg, and the Duke ofArgyll having addressed
the House, the Earl of Aberdeen, in reviewing the debate contrasted the
heavy allegations made against him-sufficient if true to justify a vote
of censure if not to warrant an impeachment-with the impotent conclu-
sion of a motion for papers; justified the measures taken by his Govern-
ment to avert war (which he believed still to be not inevitable), and gave
assurances that every possible preparation was being made for war.
The motion was withdrawn.
(COMMONS.) Mr. Layard gave notice of a motion for a Committee on
the relations between England, Russia, and Turkey. Mr. Oliveira moved
a resolution for the reduction of the Wine duties to ls. a gallon, which

Chancery.

read a first time, and the second reading was fixed for March 13.
Feb.
(LORDS.) A debate on the Irish national education system
raised by the Earl of Eglinton moving for a Committee on
17.
the subject, which was agreed to.
(Commons.) Mr. Layard developed his motion on the Eastern ques-
tion, the main object of which seemed to be to condemn the ministerial
want of energy on the subject, and to elicit a declaration of their inten-
tions from Government. In the debate that followed Sir J. Graham
and Mr. Roebuck defended the Government; Lord J. Russell entered
at great length into the whole question; and stated the intention of the
Government to prosecute the war with vigour. The debate was ad-
journed.
Feb.
(Commons.) The adjourned debate was resumed by Mr.
Cobden, who dwelt at great length on the weakness and bar-
20.
barism of Turkey, its tyranny towards its Christian popula-
tion, the importance of the Russian trade, and condemned the inter-
ference of England in a vain attempt to support a decaying state. The
other speakers were Lord J. Manners, Mr. Horsman, Mr. H. Drummond,
Mr. I. Butt, Mr. S. Herbert, Mr. Disraeli, Lord Palmerston, and Col.
Sibthorp. The House then went into Committee of Supply, and a vote
for 16 millions to pay off outstanding Exchequer Bills, votes for in-
creased numbers of seamen and marines, and for the payment and pro-
visioning of the same, were passed.
Feb.
(Commons.) Mr. Adderley moved the second reading of
the Manchester and Salford Education Bill, by which it was pro-
21.
posed to raise funds for educational purposes by a local rate, the

Clanricarde.

Secretary of War explained the Army Estimates, the several votes in

Navy Estimates, according to which the gross expenditure required for
the year was 7,487,948l., being an increase of 1,202,4551. upon the vote
of last year. After some discussion the first vote of 138,4671. for the
expenses of the Admiralty Office was agreed to, and the House re-
sumed; but immediately after went into a Committee of Ways and
Means, and voted 8 millions on account of the service of the year.
Feb. (Lords.) A Bill to amend Common Law Proceedings was
27. brought in and read a first time.

for second reading, were discussed.
(COMMONS.) Mr. T. Chambers moved for a Select Committee to
inquire into the rate of increase of Conventual and Monastic Institu-

was opposed by Lord J. Russell as both useless and offensive, was
carried by 186 against 119.

ments for the administration of military affairs, and for the appointment of
a War Minister. The proposition was combated by the Secretary at
War as inexpedient and inopportune. Lord J. Russell, however, having
stated that Government were ready to make certain changes after fitting
deliberation, the motion was, by leave, withdrawn.
March
(Commons.) Lord J. Russell moved that the order of the
3.
day for the second reading of the Reform Bill should be post-
poned till the 27th of April, on account of the state of public
business, and of the foreign relations of the country; which motion, after
an interesting debate, in which the chief speakers were Sir J. V. Shelley,
Sir E. Dering, Lord Lenox, Mr. Labouchere, Mr. Phinn, Sir J. Paking-
ton, Mr. Hume, Sir G. Grey, and Mr. Disraeli, was agreed to; in Com-
mittee of Supply 15,000 additional men were voted for the army.
March
(LORDS.) The Lord Chancellor postponed the second
reading of the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill, and, in
6,
reply to Lord St. Leonards, stated, that the Criminal Law
Consolidation and Amendment Bills would be referred to a Select
Committee.
(Commons.) In Committee of Ways and Means the Chancellor of the
Exchequer explained the financial condition of the country. The
various items of the revenue (which he particularised) had been
estimated last year at 52,990,0001., and had actually produced
54,025,000l. With respect to the expenditure, the Right Hon. Gentle-
man went through a series of returns showing a saving of 1,012,0001.
between 51,171,0001. the actual, and 52,183,0001., the estimated expendi-
ture of the year. Upon the whole, the financial position of the country
was more favourable by 2,854,0001. than he had ventured to hope last
year. Turning to the future, he calculated the ways and means of
1854-5 at 53,349,0001. The expenditure of the coming year showed a
large increase (which might grow even larger), the total amounting to
56,189,0001. From this the estimated income being deducted, a probable
deficiency of 2,840,0001., would be left, instead of a surplus of
1,660,0001., which, he argued, we should have had, had the peace of
Europe remained undisturbed. Against making up the deficiency by
increasing indirect taxation, or by borrowing money, the Right Hon.
Gentleman argued at much length, and then explained his reasons for
resorting to the income tax, which he proposed to double for the first
half of the coming financial year—not for the whole year, becau se he
might not want the money; and that, if he did, it would be easy to
continue the tax. From this source then he anticipated an addition of
3,307,000l., which would leave a small surplus of 467,0001. on the
balance-sheet of the year, and make the total product of the income
tax reach 9,582,0001. The Right Hon. Gentleman then recapitulated
with minuteness the details regarding the late conversion of South Sea
and some other description of stock, and concluded by moving a resolu-
tion authorizing the issue of 1,750,0001. new Exchequer bills. A
desultory debate followed, in which the principle aimed at by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer--to provide the year's outlay from the
year's revenue--was discussed: the principal speakers were Mr. Hume,
Sir H. Willoughby, Mr. Williams, Mr. Henley, Mr. Glyn, Mr. Disraeli,
and Mr. Gladstone. The resolution was then agreed to, the general
subject of finance being reserved for further discussion. The Church
Buildings Act Continuation Bill was read a second time; Mr. Hadfield's
amendment to postpone the second reading for six months being negatived
by 70 to 59.
(Commons.) Lord Palmerston announced that the royal clemency

of high treason in 1839. The Coasting Trade Bill was read a third
time and passed.
March
(Commons.) The second reading of the Succession to
Real Property Bill was opposed by Sir J. Pakington, who
8.
condemned the principle of the measure as unjust, unwise,
and totally at variance with the spirit of the constitution; and moved
the second reading for this day six months. Lord J. Russell and Mr.
Disraeli both spoke against the Bill. The amendment, after a long
discussion, was carried by 203 against 82; and the Bill consequently
lost.
March
(COMMONS.) Mr Fagan moved a resolution with a view to
the repeal of “Ministers' Money” in Ireland. Mr. Hume
9.
having seconded the motion, Sir J. Young, in moving an
amendment, explained the principle of a Bill to effect a compromise
in this matter : the amendment was carried on a division by 103 to
88.
March
(LORDS.) Lord Brougham brought in a Bill to assimilate in
certain points the Scotch Bankruptcy Law to the English.
10.
The Earl of Shaftesbury, in moving for certain papers respecto
ing the Christian population of Turkey, traced the secret motives of

the Turks towards Protestants. The Earls of Clarendon, Grey, Ellen-
borough, and Fitzwilliam, having spoken on the subject, the vote was
agreed to.
(COMMONS.) Sir J. Young moved for leave to bring in a Bill to
amend the laws relating to Ministers' Money. Mr. Fagan moved as an
amendment that leave be given to bring in a Bill for the total aboli-
tion of the tax. The amendment was supported by Mr. Bright, but
Sir J. Young's motion was carried by 136 against 93.
March
(LORDS.) A discussion raised by the Earl of Derby on the
Russian documents, lately published in the Times, relating to
13.
certain propositions made by the Emperor to the British
ministry during his visit to England, in 1844. In reference to the
article in the Times, the Earl of Aberdeen said he could not guess how
the information was obtained, unless it was by a breach of confidence
on the part of a functionary in the Foreign Office. The Report of the
Commissioners upon the Civil Service was ordered, after speeches from
Lords Monteagle, Granville, and Brougham.
(Commons.) A long discussion of a personal character, arising out of
explanations respecting certain expressions of Sir J. Graham and Lord
Palmerston at the Reform Club dinner to Sir C. Napier. The speakers
were Mr. French, Sir J. Graham, Mr. Bright, Lord Palmerston, Sir
T. Herbert, Sir W. Molesworth, Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Spooner, and Mr.
Cobden. Mr. Stonor's appointment to a puisne judgeship at Melbourne,
the new postal arrangements with Australia, the rights and treatment of
neutrals, and the confidential documents published by the Journal of St.
Petersburg, and commented on in the Times, formed the subjects of suc-
cessive discussions.
March The Lord Chancellor, in an explanatory speech, mored the
second reading of the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill.
(COMMONS.) Mr. Heywood's motion for copies of the alterations in
the Prayer Book, proposed by the Commissioners in 1689, was agreed to

having been reported, Sir H. Willoughby moved an amendment, the

to the tax over the whole year, instead of enacting its payment in the
first six months. A long desultory discussion followed, during which
Mr. Disraeli criticised the financial measures of the Government, and

to the Lords, was brought up by Lord J. Russell. The adjourned
debate on the Settlement and Removal Bill having been resumed, an
objection was made to proceed with the Bill until the House was in
possession of the Ministerial intentions with regard to Irish and Scotch
paupers. Lords Palmerston and Russell, and other members of the

without further delay. Mr. Packe’s motion, however, for adjourning

relating to the war with Russia. The leading speakers were, the noble
Lord, Mr. Layard, Mr. Bright, Mr. J. Ball, the Marquis of Granby,
Lord Dudley Stuart, Lord Palmerston, and Mr. Disraeli. Lord J.
Russell, having replied in a speech in which he rebutted the various
censures uttered against the Government, denied the existence of dif-
ferences amongst Ministers, as asserted by the last speaker, combated
the charge that the British Government had ever countenanced the pro-
posal of a dismemberment of Turkey, and defended the Ministerial
policy on the general question. The address was then unanimously
agreed to, and it was ordered to be presented to Her Majesty by the
whole House.
(LORDS.) The Church Buildings Act Amendment Bill
April
(authorising the pulling down of above thirty of the City
churches) was read a second time.
(Commons.) The House met at half-past 2 o'clock and went in pro-
cession to Buckingham Palace to present to the Queen the address in
answer to Her Majesty's message relating to the declaration of war
against Russia. When the House reassembled at half-past 5, the
Speaker read the Royal answer to the address.
April
(Commons.) In reply to a question relating to the “Hay
Fraud,” Mr. B. Osborne stated, that after investigation made
4.
it was now believed that the Messrs. Sturgeon were not the

which the Earl of Aberdeen and the Dukes of Montrose and Argyll
shared, the motion was withdrawn.
(COMMONS.) Mr. Cardwell, in moving for leave to bring in a bill
“ For the Better Regulation of Traffic upon Railways and Canals,"
explained the principles on which the Government proposed to deal
with the question of railway legislation. The number of organized
railway companies was 132; the construction of 12,700 miles of line
had been authorized, of which 7,685' miles were finished; 95 millions
of passengers had been conveyed last year; 80,000 persons were em-
ployed in different departments; powers had been given to raise capital
to the amount of 356 millions sterling, of which 264 millions had been
paid up; and the gross revenue arising in pretty equal proportions
from passenger and goods traffic, in 1853, was not less than 16,700,0001.
Government leaving the directors unshackled in their administration of
the interests of the shareholders, interfere merely for the safety and
protection of the travelling and trading public. These were the objects
to be secured by the Bill, which would also provide machinery for
arbitration under the supervision of the Board of Trade, with appeal to
the superior courts of law. A miscellaneous discussion followed, after
which leave was given to bring in the Bill.

(Commons.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer made his
8.
supplementary financial statement. The expenditure conse-
quent upon preparations for war was provided, in accordance
with his first financial statement, by the duplication of the income-tax
for half-a-year; but now that hostilities had actually broken out, an
augmented revenue had to be raised. After a general vindication of his
financial policy, the Right Honourable Gentleman reminded the House
that, in his first financial statement (March 6), the public revenue for the
year (1854-5) had been estimated at 56,656,0001., including 3,307,0001.
to be raised from the increase in the income tax, and leaving a surplus be-
yond the then computed expenditure amounting to about 467,000t. Since
that date additional votes had passed, 4,550,0001. on account of the Navy,

300,0001. for the Army,650,0001. for the Ordnance, and 500,0001. for the
Militia ; making an aggregate of about 6,000,0001. as the supplemental
estimate for known purposes. In addition, he intended to ask 850,0001.
for incidental expenses, making the total amount now to be provided for
amount to 6,850,000l. To provide that the income tax would be doubled
till the end of the war, giving, as he expected, an increase amounting to
3,250,0001.; the total annual amount from the income-tax would then
amount to 12,832,0001., and two-thirds of the war expenditure (which
he calculated at 10,000,0001. for the year) would be defrayed out of its
extension. For the remaining deficiency he would look to the con-
sumer.-From an extra 1s. a gallon on Scotch and 8d. on Irish
whiskey, he expected an increase of 450,0001. A readjustment of the
sugar duties, making the amount equal on all sugars, irrespective of
their origin, and fixing the tariff at 11s. 128. 14s. and 168., according to
the quality of the article, would produce an increase of about 700,0001.
Lastly, he proposed to increase the malt tax from 28. 9d. to 4s. a
bushel, by which he hoped to derive an increase of 2,450,0001. These
items made up the gross total of revenue required, namely 6,850,000l.
This sum, combined with the 3,307,0001. of additional taxation already
sanctioned by the House, and 1,474,0001. of reductions enacted in 1853,
but taking effect only in the present year, would leave a net augment-
ation of the public burthens amounting to 8,683,0001. As he could not
reckon upon a larger amount than about 2,840,0001. as realizable
during the current financial year, he proposed, in order to supply
immediate pressure, to issue interim bills, according to a scheme which
he described, involving the creation of four millions of Exchequer bonds
and two millions of Exchequer bills. By such aid the Right Honourable
Gentleman calculated that Government could pay all charges, and leave
a margin of 3} millions in the Exchequer. T'he Chancellor of the
Exchequer then defended the general principles upon which his financial
principles were based, and concluded a speech, which lasted three hours
and a half, by condemning the miserable policy of the old loan system
which flourished during the war of the Revolution. A long miscel-
laneous discussion followed; after which, resolutions relating to the
increased taxes on income, sugar, spirits, and malt were passed: and
after still further criticism, a resolution authorizing the issue of the
Exchequer bonds was also agreed to. The reports of the Estimates passed
by the Committee of Supply were severally brought up and agreed to.
The County Courts' Extension Act Amendment Bill and the Irish
Boundary Survey Bill were read a third time and passed ; and Sir J.
Graham brought in two Bills for the Encouragement of Seamen and

increasing the duties on certain articles; the amendment, after con-
siderable discussion, was negatived by 224 against 143. The report was

cussion followed. On a division, the second reading was carried by

withdrawal of so many important Bills during the Session. On the

presented with considerable curtailments, giving the measure more of
an enabling than a compulsory character. Clauses 1 to 28, already
discussed and agreed to, were put and passed. The succeeding clauses,
up to 32, occupied the Committee from 5 o'clock till midnight.
June
(LORDS.) The Earl of Ellenborough, in moving for returns
relating to the Miscellaneous Estimates, complained of the

June
(LORDS.) Lord Lyndhurst, in a speech characterised by
remarkable clearness and power, drew attention to the
19.
memorandum lately issued by the cabinets of Vienna and
Berlin to their envoys at the Germanic diet, contending that the
ambition and aggressive policy of Russia, which he fully exposed,
required more vigorous measures of repression than a mere return to
the statu quo in any future arrangements with that power. Lord
Clarendon in reply expressed his disbelief that Austria had any
intention of concluding peace with Russia on the terms suggested by
Lord Lyndhurst, which be fully declared would be unacceptable to
England and France; nothing but some result sufficient to fetter
and cripple the enemy would be considered satisfactory. The
Earl of Derby maintained that the memorandum bound Austria and
Prussia to accept peace whenever Russia consented to evacuate the
Principalities; but the peace of Europe must be secured from Russian
ambition ; some of the past conquests of Russia must be wrested from her
grasp; the Black Sea must not remain a Russian lake, nor the Danube
a Russian river. The Earl of Aberdeen remarked that the war from
the beginning had been defensive-to preserve Turkey from encroach-
ment; but the contingencies might require the invasion of Russia.
The Western Powers were not bound to accede to any Austrian disposi-
tions for peace. He denied that Europe had suffered much real peril
from the ambition of Russia, instancing that even towards Turkey,
Russia since the treaty of Adrianople had interfered only for the
purpose of protecting the Porte from a rebellious vassal. War should
be waged merely for the sake of peace, though not less vigorously on
that account, and should be terminated at the first moment that peace
became possible on a just and honourable basis.
(Commons.) Mr. Strutt having given some explanations respecting
his expulsion from the Ministry, the House went into Committee on the
Oxford University Bill. A clause, proposed by Mr. Phinn to restrict

viding that no person should have priority in taking his degree on
account of his rank, was negatived by 67 to 66. Other clauses were
discussed and withdrawn, and finally the Bill passed through. In Com-
mittee of Supply, on the vote of 164,1651., for gaols, hospitals, and
pauper asylums, Mr. Schofield moved to reduce the vote by 1001., by the
amount of salary of the chaplain in a lunatic asylum, for the purpose
of testing the principle acted upon a few days ago in disallowing

returns respecting the Commissariat, ordered on the motion of
Earl Grey, on the 8th of April, included a document of later date,
containing various strictures on the noble Earl's speech, by Sir C. Tre-
velyan, a Government official. After a prolonged discussion, in which the
noble mover, the Duke of Newcastle, the Earls of Derby, Ellenborough,
and Fitzwilliam, and Lord Panmure, took part, the papers were with-
drawn for the purpose of substituting an amended return.
(COMMONS.) On bringing up the report of the Oxford University
Bill, a clause, moved by Mr. Heywood, to abolish the matriculation
oath, was opposed by Government, supported by Lord Stanley, and,
after a long discussion, carried by 252 against 161. A second clause,
also moved by Mr. Heywood, for abolishing the oath on taking degrees,
was submitted to by Lord J. Russell, who, after the unequivocal ex-
pression of the opinion of the House, would not press for another
division. Mr Walpole, however, insisted on a division. If this clause
were agreed to, the dissenters would be admitted to degrees and to
Convocation. A division then took place, and the clause was negatived
by 205 to 196.

early day, a resolution condemnatory of the language of the Prime Mi-
nister in the House of Lords when speaking in reply to Lord Lyndhurst.
(LORDS.) Lord Aberdeen moved the production of the
26.
despatch, written by himself in the year 1830, in reference to
the Treaty of Adrianople, and in doing so, laboured to remove
some misapprehension respecting his speech on this day week, and con-
cluded by remarking, that war waged for the sake of peace should be
waged with the utmost possible spirit and activity ; believing the
present war to be just, he should forego no exertion to make it brief and
successful; and the success to be striven for was the conclusion of a
safe and honourable peace. The Marquis of Clanricarde followed, and
criticised at great length the career of the Earl of Aberdeen, whom he
declared to be the evil genius of the present Government. Lord
Brougham expressed satisfaction at the speech of the Prime Minister,
but apprehended that Austria would make peace on the evacuation of
the Principalities by Russia; and trusted that neither France nor

Mr. Cobden, Mr Layard, Lord D. Stuart, Mr. Disraeli, and Lord
Palmerston, A remark of Lord J. Russell's, to the effect that
Russia should not be allowed to maintain so formidable a fleet in
Sevastopol, being construed or misunderstood to mean the destruction
of that harbour and the occupation of the Crimea, led to much
subsequent discussion and many explanations. Ultimately the vote
was agreed to.
July
(COMMONS.) The Bribery Bill again formed the subject of
discussion. Lord J. Russell's clause relating to refreshments
25.
to voters was again affirmed by 77 to 35, and an amendment,

Mr. Layard, after some justification of his own conduct, criticised the
diplomatic interchanges with Austria, and expressed a total want of

operations of the fleet. Mr. M. Milnes approved of the war policy of
the Ministry, which had been assailed only on trifling points, but
blamed the Government for dallying with Austria ; and Mr. Peto urged
confidence in the Ministry. Lord J. Russell defended the practical
operations set on foot by Government, and defended Lord Aberdeen
against the charge of lukewarmness in carrying on the war. After
some further explanations, the motion was negatived by consent, and
the report of the Committee of Supply 'agreed to.
(COMMONS.) The adjourned debate on the Russian
July

mittee of Supply, and the vote for the purchase of Burlington House
was again discussed, and carried by 143, against 23 who voted with Mr.

vent it from producing

the motion was carried by 26 against 23, and the Bill then passed

ment for three months; the amendment was carried by 23 to 13, and
the Bill' rejected.
(COMMONS.) Lord Palmerston moved the second reading of the
Public Health Act Amendment Bill, of which he explained the object.
Lord Seymour opposed the Bill at considerable length from “ a decided
conviction that the Board of Health had not discharged their functions
'in such a manner as to justify their continuance,” and that the changes
made by that Bill did not provide for the better performance of their
duties in future: the noble Lord moved the second reading this day
three months. The amendment was seconded by Sir B. Hall, and,
after a long discussion, carried by 74 against 65. Mr. Lucas called
attention to the subject of encouraging manufacturing industry in

tions to the effect that, in consequence of the conduct of Russia, England
was absolved "from all obligation to continue to make payments on

reply, denounced the motion of the noble Lord as only another form of
the doctrine of repudiation; and, entering at large into historical and
international views of the question, showed that Russia had not infringed
the conditions on which the continuance of the liability of Great
Britain depended. After considerable discussion, the motion was.
rejected by 57 against Sir W. Molesworth obtained leave to bring

French, my efforts will be directed to the effectual repression of that
ambitious and aggressive spirit on the part of Russia, which has com-
pelled us to take up arms in defence of an ally, and to secure the future
tranquillity of Europe. You will join with me in admiration of the
courage and perseverance mauifested by the troops of the Sultan in
their defence of Silistria, and in the various military operations on the
Danube.” Her Majesty then proceeded to notice the Coasting Trade
Act, the Bribery Prevention Act, and that for regulating the University

XII. ARCHITECTURE AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
1.- GENERAL PROGRESS :-STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
Although evidences of great progress in the several departments of
knowledge and practice connected with architecture, are not generally
to be furnished out of the records of twelve months past—we see now,
no reason to modify the expression of the satisfaction we felt, in the
opening remarks of the last number of the Companion.' Advance-
ment of art in popular estimation ; development of better principles
in architectural criticisin ; improvement of towns in all points con-
nected with convenience and internal communication, sanitary re-
quirements, and sightliness; provision, for whatever class, of places
of residence, innoxious to the individuals, and to society, -yet not
deficient in the element of taste-each and all of these objects are
being realised, -although it may be, at a rate of progress much
within the desires of those whose exertions have been long and
arduous, and by whom the main objects have been understood from
the outset.
To ourselves, viewing the probability of future progress in art, the
contributions of the past year, if few in number, appear by no means
unimportant. A work like that of St. George's Hall, at Liverpool,
just completed, is one of which any country in any period, celebrated
for its art-productions, might be proud. The Crystal Palace—though
the building is not calculated to effect all that has been anticipated by
some persons-contains a collection which may add largely to the
knowledge of former styles, and to the estimation of art in general, and
which supplies resources for the production of original works.—Look-
ing to the question of sanitary improvement, the recent prevalence
of the cholera even will prove a source of benefit, if it should awaken
men to the constant danger, from kindred causes, in which they live.
In the metropolis, the whole length of New Cannon Street is now
open, several new warehouses and sets of chambers have been com-
pleted, and others are still in progress, and the later erections display
considerable improvement in architectural character. This, it must
be allowed, results in great part, from the omission, in the lower
storey, of enormous plate-glass windows--such as in other cases
destroy the effect sought for, in the best-designed superstructure.
In the latest specimen of shopkeepers' architecture of the objec-
tionable kind in St. Paul's Churchyard), the “spirited proprietor'
exhibits cut-glass shafts, as the framework to the plate-glass, and as
apparent support to the brickwork above. Although there may be
no doubt of security in such cases, the eye is not satisfied. Bulk in
supports, and breadth of base, have a natural connexion with the
of stability. The sense of satisfaction which there might be in the
case of even a weaker material, is the simple perception of certain plain
elements of statics; and the comparison which is instituted in the
other case therefore is founded in reason. Now, the difficulty of shop
fronts and the assumed requirements may be reconciled. Bridge the
space by an arch, as in New Oxford Street, or gain in the additional
height, the window to the required gallery of a shop with the best

arrangements for light and convenience, or where the selection is in
favour of the useful mezzanine storey, according to the well-arranged
plan in the buildings in Victoria Street, and every object is attained.
Indeed, no existing arrangement is so well adapted for London build-
ings generally, as one combining shop and domestic architecture, as
in the case last mentioned, and we are here considering at once, the
economic use of buildings, the investment of capital, and the archi
tecture of London streets. The allusion, however, to the lighting
of ground storeys had rather reference to the particular mode adopted
in warehouses and offices, such as those in New Cannon Street.
There, without the sacrifice of architectural character, or apparent
stability, a large surface for light is obtained with very narrow piers.
The character of aperture generally adopted is one referred to in our
last volume, the stilted-segmental arch. Professor Cockerell, to
whom we attributed its invention, has had the candour to remind
us that the form is found in Pompeii. The questionable strength
of narrow piers, as first used in Victoria Street, with such a heavy
mass above, we should not omit to mention.
By the opening of New Cannon Street, and the removal of a tri-
angular block of buildings near the east end, a noble view of St. Paul's
cathedral has been obtained, and it has been urged upon the City
authorities, that the full advantage of this view should not be impaired
by ayain covering the piece of ground referred to. In the importance
of this suggestion, not only do we concur, but we are anxious to see
a further clearance of buildings thereabouts, and even of St. Paul's
School itself. The Committee of the Corporation, with whom the
matter rests, however, seem to view themselves as trustees—whose
duty it is, to get the utmost pecuniary return from every description
of property. It might seem, that an improvement in one locality
might not be without influence upon the value of property elsewhere;
but without discussing the principle to which the Committee conceive
they may be bound, let us say that this is not the first instance in
which some sufficient representative of the public interest has been
wanted to preserve advantages confessedly beyond all price to the
public.
The extension of Farringdon Street has of late years, had a stand-
ing paragraph in the Companion, and we cannot yet report the
work as completed. Much, we believe, may be said in extenuation of
the management of this undertaking, which has till lately been con-
tending against“ the evils of divided authority,” and has been de-
layed by the necessity of considering one scheme or another with
which it was desirable to work in unison. We believe, however,
that the chief difficulties are at length being removed, and that the
street is in a fair way for being completed at no distant time. But
at the present moment, we should say, there is a project on foot
which has some connexion with the improvements, namely, the
scheme for a subterranean railway from the City, and which in one
part of its length is to be carried under the line of the New Road.
The principal street improvement in any of the other quarters of
the town, is that of the removal of a large mass of houses near Buck-
ingham Gate, Pimlico, for the widening of the road at the corner
a

near the palace. The eastern sides of Stafford Row and Queen's
Row, and parts of Arabella Row and Charlotte Street have been
demolished, and the newspapers have been setting down the names
of celebrated literary men who had at one time or other dwelt in the
houses : Gifford, of the Quarterly Review,' was perhaps the most
note-worthy.
The arrangements for the provision of public parks are in much
the same state as last year. This is to be regretted, as annually a
very large number of houses are added to the town, and no such ex-
tension should be allowed to proceed without the allotment of ample
space for recreation. The London squares are not laid out with the
requisite taste, and, besides, are not open to the general public. If
the fields near Hornsey-Wood House are to be converted into a park,
the inhabitants of the district should not place their dependence upon
Government, but should secure for themselves what may not be open
to them after another season of building operations. We are glad,
however, to see the use that has been made of Kennington Common,
where, too, the model houses built for Prince Albert, from the design
of Mr. Roberts, have been removed from Hyde Park.
The deficiencies of London in regard to communication between
the two sides of the river, are still a subject for contrast with the ad.
vantages of Paris and other cities. The suspension-bridge near
Chelsea is yet in progress; but the more substantial work of the
piers and abutments may be said to be completed. The embankment
of the river in the same neighbourhood progresses. At Battersea
Park the ground is being levelled, and the roads are in progress.
At Westminster, scaffolding and platforms have been erected, and
piles driven, preparatory to the formation of the piers of the new
bridge, of which some few particulars will fall under another section.
The want of offices for the increasing business of the country has
lately attracted much attention. Public property is ill managed in
regard to leasing ; valuable ground remains for years unoccupied ;
enormous rents and expenses for propping up ricketty structures,
are going on; and departments are disorganised by hasty removals ;-
and really we may be allowed to ask, whether a tithe of this expense
would not have paid for a building which might have been the finest
of its kind in Europe ? The purchase of Burlington House is, how-
ever, a good step, and although we can hardly wish to see the re-
moval or alteration of any building which has pretensions to archi-
tectural character, we hope good use will be made of it. The
several scientific societies have had their claims considered in regard
to it. We may here say that the front of Somerset House, to Wel-
lington Street, is still incomplete ; but a wing is in progress corre-
sponding with that next the bridge. Of the intended National
Gallery nothing definite has been heard. Although it is our chief
business to record what has been done, we may be permitted to urge
that, if what some consider the last chance for our reputation in the
eyes of Europe is to be tried through a public competition, the
opinion of bodies that may represent the architectural profession
should be taken as to the best mode of securing common objects. It
is
very important that the business should be conducted in a proper
a

a
manner, not only as regards the present case, but as to those buildings
in future years in which this case may be referred to as a precedent.
The sculptors have lately been making complaints about the manage-
ment of their competitions, similar to those which have proceeded from
architects. It would take us beyond our limits even to name the
public statues placed in many of the provincial towns. We are glad
to think that the art of the sculptor is now combined with that of the
architect, frequently. The pediment of the Great Western Railway
Hotel, at Paddington, has been enriched with a group of figures by
Thomas. These represent the four quarters of the globe, with
animals of various kinds, and figures of Peace, Plenty, Industry,
and Science. The same artist has executed rilievos of Peace and
War for Buckingham Palace.
In the Wellington Testimonial, London Bridge (south end), the
general character of Queen Eleanor's crosses is adopted, with a later
style of architecture.
2.-SEWAGE.—WATER.–CEMETERIES.
Great changes have been made in the chief management of the
Board of Health. It may be hoped that what has been done will
be productive of some speedy and definite measures, to secure the
metropolis not only against attacks of the dreadful description of
that which awaited Sir Benjamin Hall's accession to office, but
also against the prevalence of disease, perhaps hardly less ca-
lamitous though less attended to. Sanitary enthusiasts and prac-
tical men had got into a state of intolerant advocacy of particular
views, which is an attitude about the worst, at any time, for the
ends to be reached by knowledge and skill. More concessions than
have as yet been exacted from each party, would no doubt follow the
liberal investigation of opposing views, and we venture to urge the
necessity of this, as we still feel how far removed from right settle-
ment are many of the chief sanitary questions. The Commission of
Sewers one day is attacked for permitting a considerable length of
one of the principal sewers to remain uncovered. The Commission
reply with what we should read as reasons why the sewer could not
have been, and should not be covered, and then order the work to be
done. Surely there was error one way. And here we come to the
real difficulty of the sewage question. Cover over the sewers, and
they must discharge their poisonous emanations somewhere ; either in
increased volume at the outlet; or by the apertures in the streets,
which certain confident writers in the newspapers would close, come
what might; or up the rain-water pipes and similar channels, which
other writers would substitute, and into sleeping-apartments; or
back on the ordinary course of drainage into the houses. And sup-
posing this one difficulty overcome by the use of the air. pump, or
other exhausting agency, there is still the question of outlet. Even
a cesspool may be a better receptacle than a ditch choked with
weeds, or a road-drain laid on no particular principle, each of which
is used in the outskirts of London. But, there is no difficulty in
assuming that an overflowing cesspool under the floor of a cellar,
where a whole family live and sleep, is not otherwise than likely

to prepare the way for cholera. Still, it seems desirable to un-
derstand, whether there are evils in the alternative of a gigantic
cesspool to the east of London, and whether the facilities for rapid
removal of sewage for the purposes of agriculture, or the results of
deodorizing, are sufficient to form protection from the real cause
of evil, which may, perchance," be imperceptible to the senses. The
argument against that view would doubtless be, that the sense
of smell is given to us as a means of warning, and that it is only
because the sense becomes blunted by long residence in towns, that
we are unable to detect the causes of disease. Recent investigations,
however, have tended to show that there is something in the air
beyond what had ever before been supposed.
Without going deeper into the question, we may observe that the
Commissioners of Sewers are proceeding, by the aid of a small
instalment of the amount of their estimate, upon part of the main
drainage scheme recommended by their engineers. Great activity
has also been displayed in the general sewerage; not, however,
without the expression of much apprehension as to immediate conse-
quences. Some of the provincial towns have made progress in the
application of sewage to agricultural purposes. At Rugby; the
Local Board had lately, leased their drainage to a grazier for 20
years, at 50l. a-year. What may be easy in the case of a town of
8,000 inhabitants, with a farm of 400 acres close by, is difficult under
the complicated circumstances of London. At Rugby, the outfall is
into a tank of 50 feet in diameter, and 10 feet deep, and which holds
120,000 gallons. An engine of 12-horse power is provided, and by
means of a gutta percha pipe encircling the tank, a current of air is
forced through the manure with the view of preventing settlement.
Ten miles of iron pipes of 6, 4, and 3-inches bore, have been laid,
to convey the sewage over the farm; and the joining of these with
lead is said to have cost no less than 5001. The testimony of Mr.
Mechi has been given most strongly in favour of the value of the
sewage of London, and altogether there seems no reasonable ground
for doubt about this part of the question ; the difficulty seems to be
to get the sewage innocuously to the places for distribution. The
plan of Mr. Martin, the painter, lately deceased, to whom the chief
part of the credit of the idea of the utilization of sewage is due, if
we do not mistake, contemplated the transmission of it to all sides
of London, rather than to a single great reservoir at one extremity.
But, all the efforts of a Commission will be insufficient unless the
owners of houses can be induced to make use of the sewers. In
certain districts whole streets have been sewered, and but one or two
houses have been connected with the sewers; and where there is
the show of proper drainage, the drain, or some other part of the
arrangement, is in such a condition, as to form an evil in itself greater
than that which was to be avoided. As certain animals are said to
hide their eyes when danger is near, there are many persons who
appear to think, when they have done something under the name of
drainage, that they are entitled to protection ever afterwards, and
that there is no occasion to examine whether what has been done
performs its office. With the carelessness of the occupiers of houses,

and the grasping spirit of landlords, it is difficult to know how to act.
The fear of infringing the liberties of the subject, interferes with the
suggested enactment for the condemnation of houses not built with
certain requisites; and it must be allowed that the present Metro-
politan Buildings' Act has not been always advantageous to structural
improvement. Even the stringent powers of the Nuisances’ Removal
and Diseases’ Prevention Act during the height of the recent epi-
demic, were found insufficient in some important cases.
It is necessary to allude to the water question, though it cannot be
said that improvement has yet been effected in the miserable condition
of London as to the quantity and quality of the supply, unless it be
in the Lambeth district. By the Metropolitan Water Supply Act of
1852-passed, we conceive, hastily-it was enacted, amongst other
things, that none of the Companies drawing their supply from the
Thames, should, after August 1855, take water for domestic use from
below Teddington Lock. Thus the opinions as to the unsuitableness
of the Thames water in all cases were set aside. The Lambeth Com-
pany already draw their supply from the Thames, a little above
Kingston; and the Chelsea Company, who are allowed till August
1856, will draw theirs from near the same place. The Grand Junction,
the West Middlesex, and the Southwark and Vauxhall Companies
will each take their supply at Hampton, six miles above Teddington
Lock. The Grand Junction Company lately said that they supplied
over 300 gallons per house per day, and that with their new works,
they could give four times as much if wanted. The inhabitants in
the district are said to average 9 or 10 to each house. The South-
wark and Vauxhall Company say they give over 26 gallons per head
per day, and that with their new works they could give more than
double that. Presuming these statements to be correct—it might be
wondered at, that there should ever have been any complaint as to
insufficient supply, even in districts where the number of persons in
a house is more than nine or ten—whatever the justice of the com-
plaint as to impurity—since the Commissioners for Inquiring into the
Condition of Towns, &c., placed the minimum requisite, at 12 gal-
lons per day per head. The real reason of the complaints, however,
in one respect, is traceable less to deficiency, than to the evils at-
tending the want of frequent or constant supply. With a quantity
of water, sometimes overflowing—to damp the foundations and floors
of houses—there has been often, no water to be had. Where the
difficulty is attempted to be removed by storage, independent of the
new evils which result, the cistern is usually either too small, or
is exposed to every sort of pollution. Hence, we are liable to be told,
that the chief cause of the evil rests with the owners and occupiers of
houses. The tenant of a single floor or room, one of the class which
forms the majority of the London population, can but smother his
disgust at the unpotable compound, or take the alternative of other
drink. We therefore hope that the full measure of relief will be
afforded, as indeed, from what we have said, it appears it can only be,
by carrying out the system of constant supply. This, if called for, the
Companies can be obliged to furnish by a certain extended time. The
Kent Waterworks Company, who take their supply from the Ravens-
a

-
bourne, above the tidal influence, state that they are already able to
afford this constant service. It is expected, that at least those com-
panies that propose to take their supply from the lower part of the
Thames, will
have their arrangements completed by the appointed
time. The Chelsea Company expect to be in readiness by the spring
of 1856. The Hampstead Company, whose supply has long been both
impure and insufficient, are at present sinking an artesian well at
Kentish Town; but it is not expected that the required quantity will
be reached for some time. The New River Company have gone to
Parliament for power to effect the diversion of the sewage of Hert-
ford, some of the ingredients of which, with all the self-cleansing
properties of streams, it is difficult to suppose may not remain to
contaminate the water. The same company is either proceeding
with or contemplates the covering over reservoirs “ within five
miles of London," namely, those at New River Head, Highgate,
and Maiden Lane; and is also carrying out filtering-works.—The ar-
rangements in the case of some of the provincial towns would deserve
atention from those about to commence new works. At Dunfermline,
in Scotland, the Fife Herald describes the filtering-floor as com-
posed of—first, a layer of rough granite 12 inches thick-on this, a
layer of fine gravel 6 inches thick, and lastly, one of fine sand 18
inches thick ; the whole borne by stone slabs, open at the joints, and
supported on piers. We have not noticed any attempt to introduce
the principal filtering medium of domestic filters-charcoal, which has
such peculiar purifying properties. This reference to the subject
of water-supply leads us to state that at Manchester, where, we
believe, the constant-service system is already in operation, cholera
has visited the town but lightly. The sanitary question there, has
its importance felt: local committees are in full operation, and every
effort seems to be made to diffuse a knowledge of the laws of health
amongst all classes of the inhabitants; so that the praise given by
Lord Shaftesbury some time back was, no doubt, well deserved.
But we have not heard, that the difficulties of the sewerage question,
as to outfall and disposal of refuse, have been fully overcome, though
as much attention has probably been paid to the construction of
sewers, as in any town in the kingdom.
Apprehension was last year expressed by us, that in the sites
chosen for the different metropolitan cemeteries, the real principle
which had so long been contended for, had been but half recog-
nised. At the present rate of increase, whether as to houses or
population, it may be very few years—before each one of the chosen
sites is within the immediate pulsation of life in this great city.
Such a mode of patching up a difficult question, the arguments of
which have been admitted after long and painful endurance of the
evil, has been too common of late. The evil is, at best, only stayed,
and is destined to occur again with redoubled force. The ceme-
tery in progress at Woking, for communication by the South
Western Railway with a house of reception adjoining the railway
station in Lambeth, therefore seems to us to be devised, as regards
the necessities of the case, in the manner adapted to them, next best
to a project where there would be communication by water. One

parish appears actually to have secured ground in the populous dis-
trict of Kilburn; and the Highgate Cemetery is also being ex-
tended. For details, chiefly architectural, relating to the new
burial-ground at Lambeth, we refer to page 230.
We add, from Mr. Scott's Preface to his edition of the Public
Health Act, 1854, a return, showing the number of places in which
the general Act has already been put in operation :-

Applications to the General Board of Health for assistance have
also been made from other places within the jurisdiction of the Me-
tropolitan Commission of Sewers, such as from Kensington, Hamp-
stead, Camden Town, Walthamstow, &c.; but as they were not
formal petitions, complying with the requirements of the Public
Health Act as to the number of signatures, &c., they are not enu-
merated in this list.
The principal portions of the Public Health Act have also been
incorporated in Local Acts for other places, such as Bath, Bolton,
Newark, St. Helen's, &c., from which no petitions or applications
were made to the General Board of Health for inquiry or other pre-
liminary proceedings under the Act.
In several instances, two or more parishes have united in petition-
ing for the Act, as in the case of Old and New Accrington ; Alnwick
and Canongate; Alveston and Boulton; Bure and Torrisholme, &c.
These are entered as single petitions, but taking into calculation the
several places thus petitioning, there have been petitions from 316
places; and the Act has been applied by Provisional Order to 92
places, and by Order in Council to 90 places.

3. CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.
It is not easy to get at statistics of the works under this head,
carried out during any single year. But it may be interesting to
learn particulars afforded by documents to which we have access.
First, let us look at what has been doing during some years past.

We find that the whole number of applications to the Incorporated
Society, up to 31st March, 1854, since the year 1818, amounted to
4,771. In 3,451 of these cases, grants had been made in aid of
the erection of 1,011 additional Churches and Chapels, and the
rebuilding, or increasing the accommodation in 2,440 existing
buildings. By these means, 936,476 additional seats had been
afforded, 716,044 of which were free. The sum contributed by the
Society was 511,7931., which sum had been associated with a further
expenditure on the part of the public of 3,123,4001.
The last Report of the Commissioners which we noticed, it should
have been said, was dated December 1852. Since that, there have
been two Reports. The last of these (dated in July 1854) states,
that the whole number of churches completed by the aid of grants
from the Commissioners amounted to 570, in which, provision was
made for 565,780 persons, including 338,575 free seats. These
numbers should not, however, be added to those of the Society ;
grants from both sources being in many cases derived by the
same building; but it will be seen that a very large increase has
taken place during the last thirty years, the churches being chiefly
in the Gothic style. The statistics of the Society for the last ten
years give the following results :-churches built, 447 ; churches
rebuilt or enlarged, 719; seats provided, 345,814; and of this num-
ber, free for the poor, 292,635; granted by the Society, 174,7581. ;
total cost as estimated, 1,801,7311. These large numbers, however,
by no means equal the necessities of the case, —for according to the
Report on the Results of the Census, 10,000,000 of people had
been added to the population during the previous half-century,
-or an
increase nearly equal to that of all preceding ages. The addition
during the last ten years, has been 2,300,000 persons, or an increase
in the inhabitants of these islands, exceeding that of the last 50
years of the 18th century. The population of London, which, in
1831, was 1,654,994—in 1851, was 2,362,236. We, therefore,
begin to understand why the Incorporated Society desire an increase
of 2,000 new churches and chapels. The improved character of the
population, in districts like Bethnal Green, where new churches
have been built is very remarkable. - It may, therefore, be assumed,
that we are at a great epoch in the history of architecture,-one
which may, even yet, reflect honour upon our age and country.
On the other hand, the future, like the past period of the century,
may be referred to as part of “ the age of copyism,” in which the
best that could be done, or that the clergy had allowed to be
done, had been to produce structures vastly superior to such as
immediately preceded them, but which still appeared to have their
chief merit connected with the possibility of their being mistaken
for buildings erected under other conditions and circumstances.
As regards the limited time which especially concerns us, we may
say, it is supposed that the Diocesan Societies alone have contributed,
in the course of twelve months, not less than 11,0001.,-how much
more is not known. By the aid of grants from the Incorporated
Society, 21 churches were rebuilt, and 54 enlarged, or otherwise
improved, in twelve months, ending March 31st, 1854.

The Reports of the Church Commissioners, 33rd and 34th, are
dated—one, 12th of July, 1853, and the other, 11th July, 1854.
We, therefore, now get some approach to a regular annual record.
Let us first dismiss the 33rd Report. It appears that, during the
short period to which it relates, much had been done. 28 new
churches had been completed, some of them being amongst the
number mentioned in our last, as in progress.
The 28 are
(naming places, districts, parishes, and counties) :—In Aberdare,
Glamorgan (two churches); South Banbury, Oxford ; Cullingworth,
Yorkshire; at Hendon, Bishopwearmouth, Durham ; North Horton,
Bradford, Yorkshire; Antrobus, Great Budworth, Cheshire; in Sneyd,
Stafford ; All Saints, Norwood, Croydon, Surrey ; in St. George,
Darlaston, Stafford; Langley, Worcester; Pendeen, St. Just,
Cornwall; Balsall Heath, King's Norton, Worcester; at Shipley,
Kirkburton, and in All Saints, Leeds, Yorkshire; in St. John,
Limehouse, and in Carlisle Street, in Christ Church, St. Marylebone,
Middlesex ; at Pont-y-Rhun, Merthyr Tydvil, Glamorgan; in St.
Mark, Albert Road, St. Pancras, Middlesex ; Rhos Llanerchrugog,
Ruabon, Denbigh ; at Embsay, Skipton, Yorkshire; Newtown,
St. Mary, Southampton; St. Matthias, Stoke Newington, Middlesex
at Levesden, Watford, Herts; in St. Paul, Lane Bridge, and All
Saints, Burnley, Lancashire; in the united parishes of St. Maurice,
St. Mary, Kalender, and St. Peter, Colebrook, Winchester; and
in Chesterton, Stafford. These churches, it was expected, would
provide accommodation for 18,846 persons, including 13,873 free
seats for the poor.
The works of the twelve months, ending 11th July, 1854, were
23 in number, viz. :-At Abertilery, Aberystruth, Monmouth ;
Ladywood, St. Martin, Birmingham, Warwick”; Gomersall Birstall,
Yorkshire Penponds, Camborne, Cornwall; Barkisland, Halifax.
Yorkshire; Brynford, Holywell, Flintshire; Hove, Sussex; in
Thornhill Square, and at Tollington Park, Islington, Middlesex ;
in St. George, Leicester ; Maestog, Llangynwyd, Glamorgan ; at
Forest Hill, Sydenham, Lewisham, Kent ; in Sť Jude, Hunslet; in
Buslingthorpe, in New Wortley, and in St. Thomas, Leylands,
Leeds, Yorkshire ; at Rhonda Valley, Llanwonno, Llantrissent,
Glamorgan; Coalbrook Dale, Madeley, Salop; in Christ Church,
Denton, Manchester, Lancashire; at Somercotes, Riddings, Derby
Brightside, Sheffield, Yorkshire; and at Edensor, Longton; and
Knutton Heath or Silverdale, Wolstanton, Staffordshire. In these
23 churches accommodation is provided for 14,897 persons, including
9,723 free seats.
Besides the names mentioned, the Incorporated Society supply us
with others of new churches completed during twelve months ending
31st March, 1854, at the following places :—Marlow; Eastbury,
Berks; Neithrup, Banbury ; Redbank, Blurton; Holyrood, Man-
chester; Bottisham Lode, Cambridgeshire ; Pont-y-Rhun, Neiford;
Brynford, Holywell; Cefn Nen, Caernarvon ; Scarisbrick, Orms-
kirk; Gorsedd, Flintshire; Studley, Trowbridge ; Little Tew,
Oxford ; Pottery Fields, Leeds ; Bitterne, Southampton ; Luton,
Teignmouth ; and St. John, Darlington. The Society had assisted

common.
in all, 34 new churches, finished during the year. Many other
works have been completed from other resources, and many are now
in progress.
We, last year, gave a tabular statement, compiled from the reports
of the works then in progress ; but as we find this year, some dis-
crepancies betweeen the lists of the Church Commissioners and a
list with which we have just been favoured by the Society, we think
it better not to run the risk of misleading. But we may say that
the styles of the churches, as described by the architects, are chiefly
“ Gothic of the 14th century,” though the Early English also is
Both Norman and Perpendicular are generally excluded.
One of the best of the recent London Churches, is St. Andrew's,
in Thornhill Square, Islington. The architects are Mr. F. B.
Newinan and Mr. John Johnson. It is a large cruciform structure
in the decorated style, with a tower and broach spire at the angle.
It has galleries in the transepts and west end, and will accommodate
upwards of 1,500 persons. The original estimate was 7,0001. It
is said to be well built as regards sound; but we can hardly agree
with one critic, who considers the cruciform plan as that which is
best adapted for a large congregation. The unsuitableness of it in
the old churches, is shown by the “ hagioscopes,” used for the pur-
pose of allowing a view of the altar from the transepts. Mr. J. L.
Clemence, the architect of the church at Lowestoft, seems to have
pleaseıl the ecclesiologists of that part of the country, by an effective
introduction of the hagioscope. Still, the arrangement must be but
a make-shift way of remedying an original defect.- In the church
last named, the extreme of effort to avoid sameness of design is
almost reached, the 30 windows which there are about the building,
being each different. This modern tendency of architects enters
into one of the most important questions in æsthetics. There should
certainly be a general uniformity in leading lines. There is a good
feature at Lowestoft Church, in the projecting stone canopy over the
clock face.—The grouping of the tower and spire of the Church of
St. Chrysostom, at Everton, near Liverpool, by Mr. Raffles Brown,
strikes us as successful. There is also a pleasing unity of character
in the somewhat acutely-pointed window arches, and the steep
weatherings of the buttresses and base of the tower. Internally,
the columns are of polished granite. This church has transepts,
but the tower is at the west. Such an arrangement of plan, though
very common in the old churches, is open to the objection,—that
just at the intersection of the roofs, where we should expect some
crowning feature, generally nothing of the kind is attempted. It is
true, that where the ridges of the roofs are not on the same level,
the deficiency is not so remarkable; but the design is seldom com-
plete without the feature which is common in the continental
churches, namely, a small lantern or spire-capped turret. Such a
feature has been cleverly introduced by Mr. E. B. Lamb, in his
church at West Hartlepool, which more especially needed it, from
the circumstance of its having no clerestory. We do not kuow
whether Mr. Lamb's works in the Gothic style, would meet with
the approval of certain authorities, whose influence upou archi-

219
tectural art has cut both ways; but they are certainly marked by
much artistic feeling as well as novelty. The Early English style in
this case, is very freely treated. There is an apsidal sacrarium, a
rose window to the south transept, and a lofty turret at one of the
eastern angles of the tower. The tower, which has tall and narrow
proportions, has its novelty of effect given by bold-weatherings,
especially by one at the top, -the quatrefoil battlement appearing
to be “set in ” considerably; the angle turret rising 27 feet higher
than the 100 feet of the tower, The turret at the intersection,
before referred to, is octagonal, with quatrefoil piercings, and is
crowned by a spirelet.
We have, however, little space for descriptive details, and we do
not know that there are especial features in the majority of recent
works that would call for notice. We may, however, mention that the
church in Gordon Square has been opened since our notice of it, also
that the restorations at Ely Cathedral are being proceeded with in
good style, under Mr. Scott's directions. A new reredos, in which
sculpture in alabaster is introduced, is one of the most recent
additions.-A new church at Rosherville groups effectively with an
adjoining parsonage.
There is much to be learned from comparison of the modes of
treating the architecture of religious uses by different sects. The
style of Dissenting Chapels is decidedly improving, and we still
think that there is something to be gleaned from it, both in “what
to shun,” and in “ what to follow.” The Perpendicular style has
been not unfrequently used with considerable novelty and success,
as in the Mansion House Chapel, Camberwell, by Messrs. Wilson
and Fuller: Here the main feature in the effect is given by
octagonal turrets crowning two western entrances, terminated each
by an open lantern and crocketted spire. The schools, class-rooms,
and vestries, being in the rear of the building, the disagreeable
height in other cases was easily avoided. In the Congregational
Church at Winchester, where the schools are similarly placed, the effect
is, however, still retained in the interior, though with slight disad-
vantage. The plan may be described as that of an elongated octagon,
formed by columns and arches all round, and having galleries,- with
a hammer-beam open-timbered roof, and a lantern. The galleries
are placed low down, and are supported by the piers, the moulding
of the lower part of the front being carried round them. The
front itself is a railing. The principal part of the height is given
to the space over the galleries. The organ is in the gallery at the
back of the pulpit. There is this recommendation of the course
chosen by Mr. W. F. Poulton the architect,-namely, that it does
not seek to ignore the existence of features-galleries - which it has
not yet been proved are to be dispensed with in churches. The
churches of Sir Christopher. Wren and his- successors have the
merit of treating the galleries with no ill success as an integral part
of the building, and ïï the great height which appears to be still
thought necessary in the aisles of Gothic churches be persevered in,
we think some consistent treatment of the gallery night be looked
for in ecclesiastical architecture.-In the wiss Church in Endell

Street, Mr. G. Vulliamy_boldly throws off the burthen of the
Gothic style altogether. We cannot say, however, that this is with
much advantage in the exterior—a composition of three-quarter Doric
columns and pediment to the attic, in cement. We were not
prepared, however, for the effect which the interior presents in
its semicircular roof, lighted by a lantern, and enriched with
ornaments of good character. There is a gallery at the east end,
and a semicircular niche opposite. Our general readers are not,
perhaps, interested in that difficult part of an architect's labour,
which, like the skeleton of the figure, is concealed from the eye,
but we may remark that the roof framing in this building, though
not on a new principle, would be worthy of attention, and it has been
most efficiently carried out.
One of the most recent undertakings of the Roman Catholics, is
the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, at Brompton, for the order of
clergy, one time established in King William Street, Strand. The
buildings, which are still incomplete, will occupy a large extent of
ground near the Brompton Church, and consist of a temporary
church, residence, oratory, and various appurtenances. The Italian
style has been followed by Mr. Scoles the architect, but with no
very remarkable effect externally. The original cost of the site was
16,0001. The extent of the provision may be inferred when we
say that the dwelling will accommodate 40 persons, and includes
refectory, library, recreation room, private rooms, domestic chapel,
lavatory, bath-rooms, and lecture and congregation rooms. The
oratory and library each measure about 72 feet by 30 feet, the
former being 29 feet in height, and the latter 23 feet. The refectory
measures 50 feet by 30 feet, and is 28 feet in height, and the prin-
cipal corridors are 164 feet in length, 9 feet in width, and 14 feet
in height. The architecture of the temporary church, though
simple, as required, is not without merit. The roof timbers are
painted a dull red colour, and the spaces between are dark blue.
But the coarse and tawdry coloured prints which are hung about,
and the coloured sculpture, belong to the low class of art, which,
with all the reproaches against English taste, as well as prejudice, is
happily not so common here as in continental churches.
The report of the Cathedral Commission, dated 6th April, 1854,
contains a few interesting particulars as to the state of the several
fabrics, and the nature of the repairs in progress during late years,
but we must content ourselves with this reference to it. Some
meritorious new churches must also remain unmentioned.
4. BuildinGS FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.
The principal works at the Houses of Parliament, in progress
during the past year, are the Peers' private entrance and cloak-
rooms, a long range next Old Palace Yard, and additions to the
height of the towers. The principal tower appears to advance
slowly, being in itself a very great work. The clock-tower now
shows the commencement of the circular panel for the clock, which
will be of large size. The central tower is ne rly finished, and

is being placed near to the principal front, and groups effectively
with that block of buildings. Some alterations have been made to
secure uniformity in the canopies of the niches next New Palace
Yard. Alterations are agairi being made in the ventilation, by the
order of Parliament, and we believe, under the direction of Mr.
Gurney. It is iin possible that the desired effect in decorative fea-
tures can be retained under these constant alterations,-hastily decided
upon, and with a disregard of the architect both unwise and ill-man-
nered. Looking solely at the que-tion of expense, an aniount of
money has been squandered by Parliament, out of mere whim, vastly
exceeding what Sir Charles Barry can be justly accused of having
spent in excess of his instructions. It may be hard to tell what
should be done to gain sufficient ventilation, the importance of which
cannot be under valued ; but it is quite clear that the entire control
of all the works of a building should be in one directing head; or
good construction and convenience, or effect, or economy of cost,
will, one or the other of them, be sacrificed.
We have before expressed our sense of the importance which
should be attached to one of the works completed during the year-
St. George's Hall, at Liverpool. The readers of the Companion
may recollect, that originally two buildings were proposed, one for
a Music hall, and the other for the Assize Courts. The competition
in each case was decided in favour of the late Henry Lonsdale
Elmes, then a young man. The two objects were combined into
one design, and the building was commenced in 1838. At that time
architects had begun to be dissatisfied with the little art shown in the
use made of the Grecian style. It was seen that the fear of warring
against precedent, combined with thie necessity of providing features
required by certain modern warits, had exactly prevented both the
success of an imitation, and the production of good works of art.
Certainly, that is a time such as we can look back to, feeling that
more rational views on architectural questions have progressed since.
The scope of the Italian palatial architecture had been þarely in-
quired into, and the principal works of Sir Charles Barry—the
Travellers' Club excepted—were not built. To the memory of Elmes,
then, belongs the credit - which may be fully apprehended when his
work becomes known-of having put forth a triumphant vindica-
tion of the truë meritš; and the still liviný power, of the classical
architecture. It may appear that he had less difficulty about the
arrangement of the windows in a building of the character of St.
George's Hall, than had been felt by others who had attempted the
use of Grecian porticoes. The real reason, however, for his not
failing as others did, is, that he was gifted with the requisite com-
bination of constructive skill and artistic perception, without which
there can be no fruit of architecture. The design may be said to
combinë some of the best characteristics of the Grecian and the
Romari buildings, with a general character of detail moulded upon the
severe Greek style. , All the main divisions of the building, mass
well with the general outline ; nothing is irregular, or designed with
a view to that haphazard sort of effect; somewhat too much followed
of late under the plea of the picturesque. The principal features

are a noble Corinthian portico, with pediment, at the south end-filled
with sculpture, designed by Professor Cockerell—a portico of 16
columns without pediment, 200 feet in length, in the centre of the
side—and flanked by square columns, with recesses and a semicir-
cular portico at the north end. Looking at the interior, the Hall,
in the centre of the pile, is 168 feet long, 100 feet wide, and 85 feet
in height, and is spanned by a great vault. This was a common fea-
ture in Roman interiors ; but so little had the construction of such
vaults been considered in recent times, that fears were very commonly
expressed, that the space could never be covered, and sufficient abut-
ment provided. The architect's death occurred in 1847, before he had
had the opportunity of fully demonstrating that which he well knew,
and the arch was afterwards built under the direction of Mr. Raw-
linson. It is constructed in hollow bricks. We give a view of the

interior, as it has been completed under the direction of Professor
Cockerell. A better selection of an architect could not have been
made ; but, we hold that it is hardly possible for a building to be
successfully brought to conclusion by any one who has not been
architect from the commencement. The work may necessarily occupy
many years in execution ; during that time opinions change,- perhaps
more than they advance. It is impossible that there can be identity
of opinion in two different men, and—though there may
be
every
dis.
position to work harmoniously-discordant elements are mixed up,
minute in themselves, but of which the force is perceived on the ter-
mination of the work. We think, therefore, greater allowance should
have been made for the inevitable difficulties which an architect, of
no slight ability, was under. We will refrain from expressing any
further opinion at this distance from Liverpool, lest it should be an
erroneous one ; but as the question is of some importance, we feel
bound to give what is thought by persons for whom we have some
respect, and who are resident in the town. In regard to the exterior,
the accessories of the enclosure, upon which so much of the effect
of every structure must depend, are said to be quite discordant with
the building. There is an elegant stone balustrade with numerous
breaks,—whilst it is thought that even a rustic dwarf-wall would have
been a better thing. In the line of the enclosure are two polished
granite pillars, duplicates of those in our view, and which are used as
lamp-posts,—solely because, as it is said, they remained on hand after
the completion of the building. The money absorbed, and as it is
considered, absorbed disadvantageously, would have paid for statues
to the principal portico ; which, we must admit, are wanted. It
seems a misfortune that the building should be descended to, from
the street. Our correspondent further discovers that, in the interior,
the coloured materials give a piebald character, quite opposed to the
spirit of the original design, in which the noble general form and
proportion was capable of being worked out, so as to realize much
grandeur. The form and colour of the balustrade along the sides,
are thought to be out of keeping with everything else; the balus-
ters being of Derbyshire spar, with its contrasts of colour,—the rail
being of black marble. The elaborate and minutely decorated ceil-
ing, our friend thinks, wants what he calls concentration, or what, in
other cases, we have called grouping, and that it resembles rather a
pattern than a design. It is also thought that three-fourths of the
expensive work upon the chandeliers is thrown away, at the height
at which they are placed. The principal features of the interior
will be understood from the drawing, which we give. The grand
effect of the view through the arch at the end of the hall, has been
interfered with in the opposite end, by the erection of the great organ,
--one of the largest instruments in the world, with all modern improve-
ments, and produced at a cost of 8,0001. The massive brass doors,
glazed, three of which are shown in the view, are now said to have
cost 6,0001. However we may regret circumstances resulting from
the death of the original architect, St. George's Hall remains a noble
structure, and one of which both country and town may be proud.

its locality is generally apparent, and no doubt St. George's Hall has
helped to draw that attention to the resources of Greek architecture,
which has given a marked character to the buildings of Liverpool,
independent of the high merit which many of them possess.—Whilst
speaking of this town, let us say, we hear that a new Corn Exchange
in Brunswick Street, in “ the Italian Palazza style,” by Mr. J. A.
Picton, is approaching completion. In the same town,

Buildings has undergone a needless alteration of the exterior
in the course of one of those changes—so often decided upon without
consideration for anything beyond the immediate purposes of busi-
The result here has been simply, that the extension of the
Post-Office Department has been allowed to mar the symmetry of a
façade. Surely means might be found to avoid the waste of
money and opportunities in this way.- Each one of the leading
provincial towns seems to have erected, or to be contemplating a
public building, of some pretension, if not with claims to taste. In
numerous instances, the structure has been a Corn Exchange. At
Louth, a Corn Exchange has been built, by Mr. Pearson Bellamy,
of good Italian character, with a narrow front of three storeys; with
pilasters panelled, and rusticated Venetian windows with balconies,
and a figure of Ceres in a niche over the doorway.-We spoke of
the Leeds Town-hall, a building of the same class as that at Liver-
pool, in our last volume. At Burslem, there is a new Town-ball, by
Mr. G. T. Robinson, in the Italian style, which has a tower at one
end,—the angles formed by clustered pillars--affording a space for
speakers. At the top is a clock-turret, surrounded by scroll but-
tresses, partly in the form of Caryatides. The lower storey is rusti-
cated, and arched—for carriages to drive under.–At the Leamington
new Public Hall, by Mr. D. G. Squirhill, we find only a well-pro-
portioned room of 80 feet, by 33 feet. The system of lighting by
sun-burners in the ceiling, however, may be mentioned. The plan
is being adopted in some of the London shops, with advantage.
We look forward to great improvement in the lighting of public
buildings.
It is rather a shock, after some of the worthy efforts that we
have been examining, to come back to London, and find, in the
populous district of Paddington, a vestry Hall of the pseudo-Greek
style, and of that poor character, of which even the speculative
builders round about, are getting ashamed.
The mernbers of the Carlton Club, are at length completing their
house in Pall Mall. Mr. Sydney Smirke is the architect. Our
readers will recollect that the design is an adaptation from the
Library of St. Mark, Venice,-a beautiful work by Sansovino,
which, however, it is not creditable to English art, or even politic
as to intended effect, to copy from. Some of the best features are
omitted in the copy; and, of course, any defects that there are, be-
come doubly reprehensible in the work of a copyist. Original work
bas a freshness of invention about it, which is the last thing we can
afford to lose. The granite columns are to be used throughout the
three fronts.-We hope that the members of the Junior United
Service Club, in their new building, will require a work of original

art, in place of imitating the Committee in the last case, and that
of the Army and Navy Club.:--The ground belonging to the City
Companies is every day becoming of so much value, that many are
induced to draw themselves within narrow limits; perhaps, in some
cases, with no advantage as regards public health. At Haberdashers'
Hall, in Staining Lane, extensive alterations are being made. A
brick front of good architectural character, attributed to Inigo Jones,
has been pulled down, the ground being devoted to other purposes.
An effective entrance-way to the Hall is, however, being provided,
and a capacious staircase of good design is being formed, as part of
the general alterations, which are under the direction of Messrs.
Allen, Snooke, and Stock. Nearly opposite, a building has been
erected for the Wax Chandlers' Company.
5.-BUILDINGS,-EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, ETC.
After several postponements, the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham,
with its grounds, was opened in June last, although by no means so
as to realise the description given in our last volume; and even whilst
we are writing, the grounds are unfinished, water for lakes and foun-
tains is unprovided, the collection of manufactures and new inventions
is but small, and the departments of raw materials and machinery are
only about being arranged. Still, there has been an immense fund
of material for the study of the art of sculpture, and of the ornamental
accessories, and, indeed, the general features of the principal styles
of architecture; and the ethnological and zoological collections, though
of less extent than might have been supposed from the prospectus,
are yet valuable aids to the diffusion of knowledge. Here, then,
the directors have given an instalment towards that provision of the
means of education by objects, which was put forward as the chief
reason for claim on public support. We are sorry, therefore, to feel
that the management of the undertaking, in some respects, is such
as to counteract the proper tendency of the collection. The artizan,
or one of a higher class, after one or two visits, will, we fear dis-
cover, that refreshment charges which in no case seem to be what
the public were led to expect, and in many cases are even exorbi-
tant, added to the cost of travelling, make up too serious an addition
to the small cost of admission, for him to give his family this means
of instruction often; and those whose time is of much value will at
length forego visits, purchased at the loss of some hours on the road.
The visitors during the last year, many of them people from the
country, were evidently attracted by no higher object than that of
ordinary sight-seeing. It is, doubtless, possible to learn even in this
way; but the company must look far higher than that of providing
novelties, both for the educational object and their commercial one.
Having noticed the building last year, we will only say, the effect
of the interior is very beautiful. The collection of sculpture begins
from the earliest period, and includes the works of modern times.
The illustrations of architecture and ornamental art include the
Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Romanesque, Moorish,
Gothic, Renaissance, and Cinque Cento styles; and though, from
their inevitable want of completeness, the Courts are, in that way,

not accurate representatives of these styles, they cannot but form
means of assistance to independent study. The collection of portrait-
busts, also, is a most interesting one. To give a full description of
the building and its contents would require more than our whole
space; but we could not omit the opportunity of showing the interest
with which we view the undertaking, and our anxiety that no effort
should be omitted calculated to forward its objects.
The increasing collection of the Royal College of Surgeons has
required the addition of a new hall of exhibition. This is lighted
from the top by glazed pannels in the ceiling and cove.
It is sur-
rounded by two tiers of galleries, and, though generally plain, is a
good model for rooms devoted to similar purposes.-
.-A new bell
tower, in the Italian style, has been added to Trinity College, Dub-
lin, from the design of Mr. C. Lanyon. It has an arched basement
of granite, is enriched with columns, has figures of Law, Medicine,
Science, and Divinity, at the angles, and is domed over and termi-
nated by a lantern. À museum also has been erected in the Renais.
sance style.—The New Theological Institute at Cuddesden, near
Oxford, by Mr. Street, provides rooms for the vice-principal and
21 students, with dining-hall, common-room, and oratory. The style
is “ decorated ;” treated with some apparent grasping after mere
singularity. The upper story has large dormers, with hipped gables
and recessed arches in the front.
The view which is here engraved is that of the new buildings for St.
Olave's Grammar School, near the church of St. John, Horsleydown.
The former building in Bermondsey Street was described in the
• Companion' for 1836. A still earlier building had been removed
by the railway company, and the one which we are referring to had
also to be displaced in 1849. The materials were saved, and are used
in the building here illustrated : but this is on a different plan, is of
greater extent, and is essentially a new design. There are two dis-
tinct establishments, with head master's residence and porter's lodge
to each. The English school is to the right entered from Rack Street
--the gable and lantern only appearing in the view. The classical
or principal school, with the entrance tower, library, and court-room,
occupy the centre. Below the first is a cloister for exercise in wet
weather. The remaining buildings include the residence of the
master of the classical school, who is principal of the establishment,
and at the back of it is a small quadrangle, a gateway, and a porter's
lodge in Potter's Fields, for the entrance to the classical school, and
class-rooms and offices. The ground in front is to be enclosed by a
dwarf wall, and iron railing. The main frontage of the buildings
is 230 feet, and the depth about 120 feet. Sittingbourne red and
Staffordshire blue bricks, and Hare Hill stone dressings, are used.
The English school is entirely formed with the materials of the old
school, and is similar to it, excepting that the lantern has been erected
on the roof. The warming and ventilation is by Messrs. Haden, of
Trowbridge. The architects are Messrs. Allen, Snooke, and Stock,
the working-out of the details, which in buildings of this elaborate
character, requires no slight trouble and skill, being, we believe, due
chiefly to Mr. Stock. The total cost, including fittings, will be about

25,0001.-Great improvements are contemplated in this part of the
town, including the removal of a block of buildings near the main
front of the school, and of others opposite the front in Potter's Fields,
which will then look on to a large burial-ground, disused, and well
planted.—The South Metropolitan Industrial Schools at Sutton,
Surrey, have been erected for 1000 pauper children from a district of
ten parishes, and are Gothic, with buttresses to the lower story, with
dormers, and louvres to the roof, and square angle turrets capped by
truncated roofs railed round at the top. The extreme length of build-
ings is 580 feet, and the depth is 370 feet. The infirmary is in the
The dining-hall is 126 feet by 33 feet. Mr. E. Nash is the
architect.—Amongst minor works, St. Augustine's Schools, at Liver-
pool. by Mr. H. P. Horner, and the National Schools, at Weymouth,
by Mr. Talbot Bury, are amongst those which are entitled to praise.
— The City of Londoni Orphan School, at Brixton, by Mr. Bunning,
is treated in a different style to others, that is, the Italian, and with
considerable success. There is a square projecting porch-like struc-
ture, with pilasters and arch-headed openings, in the centre, and above
it a bold semicircular arch to light the entrance-hall. The plan is very
well arranged. There are distinct staircases for girls and boys, one
at each end of the dining-hall, and on the former of them is a statue
of Jeanie Deans, and on the latter one of Whittington, both by
Marshall. In the hall are subjects in rilievo by Henning, taken from
the series of the Industrious and Idle Apprentices by Hogarth. The
introduction of good art into ordinary schools, lately advocated in con-
nection with some of the City schools, by a writer in the columns of
the • Art Journal,' is a step the importance of which Mr. Bunning
has felt independently, and he deserves credit for having been the
first to carry it out. The cost of the building is said to have been
about 20,0001. The materials are chiefly red brick.
6.—M18CELLANEOUS, SANITARY, AND OTHER WORKS.
We give å plan of the Metropolitan Cattle Market, now in course
of completion in Copenhagen Fields, between Maiden Lane and
the Caledonian Road. The ground is not far north of the Railway
from Camden Town to Blackwall, with which it is in contemplation
to establish branches. The principal part of the Market occupies an
equal-sided rectangle of 15 acres and 4 perches, having a fall from
the west. The pig-market and calf-market are each 3 roods , 30
perches... The banking-houšeš, 12 in number, are placed in the
centre. Out of them rises a lofty clock-tower; and the Electric Tele-
graph Company will have a station in the building, Accommoda-
tion is provided in the Market for 34,980 sheep, in 1,749 pens (with
a reserved space for considerable extension), and 13,232 feet of rail
for the tying of 6,616 bullocks. The pig and calf markets on the
west give accommodation for 1,425 calves and 900 pigs. They are
raised sufficiently to allow of the pigs and calves walking from their
standings into the carts. It is proposed to place roots, on iron
columns, and projecting, so as to shelter the carts standing in the
road, which runs from north to south, through the centre of these
markets. Water-posts are fixed about 27 yards apart ; and by means

standing for butchers' carts, and coach-houses, stabling, &c., for the
taverns. West of the market, lairage is provided for 8,160 sheep,
on an area of 6 acres and 3 perches, rather more than half of which
is covered,
-water, and racks for hay, being placed in each lair.
South of the market, lairage is provided for 3,000 bullocks, on an
area of 8
cres and 11 per es, provision being made for a supply of
water and hay to each bullock. At the north and south ends of these
lairs, 4 depôts for hay are provided. East of these lairs, 6 private
slaughter-houses are built, and on the west side, 2 public slaughter-
houses, in which 600 bullocks can be killed weekly. South of the
public slaughter-houses, a meat-market is being constructed. Ample
space for the future extension of the public and private slaughter-
houses is provided. Several public-houses are shown on the plan.
The burial-ground for Lambeth, now nearly completed, occupies
about 30 acres of ground at Tooting. Messrs. Wehnert and Ash-
down are the architects. The ground is enclosed by an iron railing,
and is laid out with the several walks at right angles, as beiny best
adapted to economic distribution of the space; and perhaps this
principle of arrangement, where planting is properly attended to,
may not be least conducive to pleasing effect. One-third of the
space is to remain unconsecrated.' The buildings—which are near the
principal entrance, consist of an Episcopal chapel, Dissenters'
chapel, two lodges, and a gate-house, between the two carriage-
entrances. The Episcopal chapel, on the north side, will afford
seats for sixty persons, and to it are attached a vestry-room, and
waiting-room, and a large porch to drive under, surmounted by a
bell-turret. The style of this and the other buildings is Early
English, the materials being white bricks and Bath stone. The
character of the whole design seems quite equal to the average
of modern Gothic architecture ; but with that, it does not follow
that there are features sufficient to impress themselves upon the
recollection. The Dissenters' chapel affords the same amount of
accommodation as the other, and the main difference which it pre-
sents, is in the omission of the bell-turret to the porch. This inde-
finite sort of design-uniformity in one part of opposite members of
a regular composition, and want of uniformity otherwise-has a ten-
dency to become too common in works of this character. It involves
an error of principle in art.—The parishes of St. Mary, Islington,
and St. Pancras, have now opened their cemetery, designed by
Messrs. Barnett and Birch. The land was at one time part of
Finchley Common, and the main entrances are in the road, between
the · Bald Faced Stag,' and the Green Man.' The portion belong-
ing to the parish of St. Pancras comprises 50 acres, 20 of which are
unconsecrated, and that belonging to the Islington parish, 30 acres,
10 of which are unconsecrated.
The whole has the appearance of
one extensive cemetery, the division being merely by posts and
chains. The ornamental plantation and shrubs, and the roads, walks,

terraces, viaducts, and buildings, have made up an extensive work.
On arches, which are to be occupied as catacombs, and ascended at
each end by steps, there is a terrace, affording space for tablets and
monuments; and from this there is a good view of the country. The
Episcopal chapel, which is well placed, is in the early decorated
Gothic style of architecture, cruciform in plan, and having a tower
and spire reaching to about 100 feet in height. The materials are
Kentish Rag, and Bath stone. Internally, there are sittings for
about 120 persons. One end is devoted to the principal mourners,
and is raised and stalled on the ordinary plan of a choir, and at the
west, where there is a carved screen, are seats for strangers. The
windows are glazed with stained glass of a deep tone of colour.
The dove, and a geometrical pattern, fill the east window, and
that at the west has figures typical of the • Resurrection' and · As-
cension,' with the Tree of Life,' and sentences from the burial service.
The Dissenters' chapel is also well placed, and is reached by a viaduct
with Gothic arches; it is octagonal in plan, with buttresses, pierced
parapet, and a stone lantern.
At the principal entrance, in the
Gothic style, is a building, as a lodge, containing a residence for the
superintendent, offices, and waiting-rooms. A residence for the
clergyman was originally contemplated opposite. There are other
buildings, as lodges or residences for gardeners.— The Act of Par-
liament requires that no part of the ground taken for the purposes
of a cemetery, shall be nearer than a certain specified distance to
inhabited houses. Under these circumstances, the parishes were
compelled to take about 8 acres more than they would have required.
Surely, it cannot be true, that they are able to look forward to a large
return from the letting of this ground for building purposes ? If so,
there must be a defect quite inexcusable in the wording of the Act.
-The parish of St. Mary Abbots, Kensington, has arrangements
in progress for a cemetery at Hanwell, and a site has been secured
at Finchley for St. Mary-le-Bone.
The establishment of Baths and Washhouses, though progressing
at a rate far within the necessities of the case, and still unaccountably
opposed in some parishes, is steadily advancing. A very healthful sign
is the constant increase of their use, as shown by the returns, and this,
and the success of the Lambeth speculation, afford grounds for believing
that these undertakings will shortly be regarded as profitable invest-
ments of capital. It has been found desirable to establish first-class
washing departments, and there is no doubt that every class in
London is more or less inconvenienced by the absence of certain
requirements of life, the provision of which has been allowed to get
far in the rear of the increase of towns. Two establishments of
Baths and Washhouses are being provided in the district of St.
George's, Hanover Square, and there is a very extensive establish-
ment in operation in Bermondsey.
At Walton-on-Thames, a well-designed red brick and stone
building, in the Italian style, has been erected for the Convalescent
Hospital, by Mr. Joseph Clarke. It cost about 12,0001. We were
concerned to hear in the neighbourhood that difficulties of drainage
had not been quite overcome.

We may include under this head, an Asylum for 400 Idiots, at
Redhill, Surrey, by Mr. W. B. Moffat. Curative treatment is
sought to be aided by improved character of architecture. The
Jacobean style is chosen; the building occupies a good position,
and there is a central tower 90 feet in height. There are recreation
galleries, 340 feet in length, ten staircases, and workshops. The
cost with fittings, is calculated at about 35,0001.
7.-BUILDINGS FOR Business PURPOSES.
Under this head may be classed some of the best architecture of
the time. We have already referred to the buildings of New Cannon
Street, and if it should be thought that these do not wholly equal
such as we referred to last year, it must be allowed that there are
several that manifest advances in taste, and a progressing desire for
displaying the beauty which there is in good architecture. Begin-
ning at the south-east corner, we notice a pile of four stories, with
good basement-dressings, balustrade and cornice, and two well-
planned entrances; that at the rounded corner has been effectively
treated-with rusticated pilasters and trusses, and a console head to
the arch. Mr. H. Dawson was the architect.-Opposite St. Swi-
thin's Church are two buildings—similar to each other—with a
considerable amount of decoration. It is only to be regretted that the
divisions by ornamental strings are too nearly equal, a fault which
spoils the al pearance of many recent works. Much care has been
paid to the design of the windows and doorways.—Amongst other
buildings, a warehouse is now in progress with some novelty in the
details of windows and rustic-work. Some of these have a Renais-
sance character.-In Liverpool, Walmer Buildings in Water Street,
Melbourne Buildings in North John Street, by Mr. J. A. Picton, and
many other structures for commercial purposes have been built. In
Lime Street, there is some very superior street architecture.—Ad-
ditions have also been made to the Manchester warehouses.-In
London, we should mention some well-designed chambers in Throg-
morton Street, by Mr. J. J. Cole, architect. It is in buildings of
this character in the city of London, that we are able to notice some
of the most hopeful inklings of the future in art. The provision of
the requisite light is often attended with great difficulty ; yet instead
of that producing an appearance of ill success in the design, it is
made the means of expressing original as well as consistent treatment,
and we are happy to record this opinion, as the productions in question
are sometimes those of men scarcely known as architects. The
qualifications of a measuring surveyor are, indeed, indispensable for
the true architect; and it is the ready perception of what can and
is best to be done for the requirements of the structure, which posi-
tively allows play to design.
One of the principal works completed in the city during the last
year, has been the reconstruction of the Stock Exchange. The
features of chief importance are the arched roof filled in with
glazed coffers-supported by the entablature of an order of engaged
columns--and a cupola over the intersection of the main arms of the
building, carried on arches and pedentives, and also coffered and

233
glazed. The details are worked out with some novelty of design ;
and the construction of the whole, necessarily a matter of difficulty,
deserves high praise. Accommodation is provided for more than
1,000 members. The cost of the works is said to have been about
11,100t: Mr. Thomas Allason was the architect.—The London and
Westminster Branch Bank in Holborn, which has just been com-
pleted, has been designed by Mr. Henry Baker. It may be
described as a four-storied stone front in the Italian style, with
rusticated projections ät the sides, where in each case there is a
doorway with columnis. The area is enclosed by a balustrade, and
the three ground-floor windows have narrow piers, and stilted seg-
mental arches. The contract was taken, we believe, at about 10,0001.
-Mr. P. C. Hardwick, who has carried out a number of successful
works during the year, is now erecting the Australian Bank in
Threadneedle Street. It is at the corner of Finch-lane. Between
this and the Exchange, the line is being set back, and the new build-
ings are of very improved charàcter. In one block the French version
of the Italiani štyle (with highly enriched dressings, and a few well
placed red bricks) is used with good effect.
8.-PRIVATË RESIDENCES.
We are able to give a view of the Queen's Residence at Balmoral,
now in progress from the designs of Mr. William Smith of Aberdeen.
The structure consists of two separate blocks of buildings joined toge-
ther by a lower connecting-wing, at the angle or return of which, at
about 70 feet fast of the principal house, stands the large tower, 35
feet square, with circular staircase turret on one angle, rising about
100 feet. The block forming the principal house is the part now
nearly completed externally. On the south and east sides there are
three foors in height; and on the west and north sides, two floors.
At the west angle of the south front will be a carriage porch, under
which is the entrance leading to the entrance hall and principal
corridor, running behind the public rooms which are on the west and
north sides, the drawing-room looking to the west, and the dining-
room to the north: These rooms are 15 feet high, and above those
on the west side are the private apartments of the Queen and the
Prince, 13 feet in height. The rooms are moderate in size ; the
drawing-room is 21 feet wide by 37 feet long, and the dining-room is
20 feet wide by 37 feet long, with a recess and columns at one end ;
the billiard-room and library are also 20 feet wide. The principal
staircase is in the centre of the corridor; and there are two side
staircases, one at each corner of the court, all of stone. The
kitchen offices, forming three sides of a square, are to be built on a
lower level than the principal house and tower; to suit the nature of
the ground; and the ball-room is placed so as to shut them in a great
measure out of view from the dining-room, and from the terrace
which is to run along that side. The principal house is wholly of
finely dressed granite, found on the estate. The building is in the
Scotch baronial style, modified in some parts to adapt it to modern
requirements; and the corbellings and other characteristic mouldings
are very well executed. The whole of the floors of the principal

house and tower, and some of the ceilings next the roof, are of fire-
proof construction, with rolled and cast iron joists, on Fox and
Barrett's patent. It is expected that the principal house—the part
now nearly finished externally—will be ready for being occupied
next autumn; and that the rest of the building will be completed by
August 1856.
Aniongst the other works of the year is an alteration of Hooton
Hall, Cheshire, by Mr. J. K. Colling, which has had the effeet of
transforming a square box into a successful work in the Italian style.
-The residences in Victoria Street, Westminster, and in Ashley
Place, and other streets adjoining, have been greatly extended.
In these the chief modern improvements in domestic conveniences
are afforded with the other advantages of residences in flats, at rents
varying from 601. to 1601. and upwards. Many of the sets are
already occupied by people in the highest class of society; and we
hope that Mr. Mackenzie, to whom this practical demonstration of
advantages which have been perceived by many, but not generally
pursued, is owing, will be able to cope still further with the real
gigantic evil of the metropolis,—the deficiency of residences on the
same principle for the middle, as well as for each other class.—Not far
from the same eighbourhood—in Francis Street-a lodging-house has
been erected for the married non-commissioned officers of the Guards.
Mr. H. A. Darbishire was the architect.—A building of a similar
description for families has been erected in Grosvenor Mews, by
Mr. Newson.
9.-RAILWAY STATIONS, BRIDGES, ETC.
There would be much to notice under this head, but we must
confine ourselves to scarcely more than an allusion to some of the
chief works. The new station of the Great Western Railway, at
Paddington, has been opened, and the “ shed” may be described as
consisting of three wide vaults, formed by great iron ribs supported
on columns. The length is about 700 feet, and the centre roof
is 90 feet in span, and the others are 70 feet. The roofs are inter-
sected by two cross roofs, or transepts, and the meeting of the ribs
gives occasion for the display of much constructive science and skill.
The architectural details throughout the roof and booking-offices
have been designed on the principle of avoiding recourse to pre-
cedent, but of seizing upon the peculiarities of two materials
hitherto free from the application of any distinct character of art,
at least in modern times—namely, iron and cement. The result is a
work of some taste and great originality. It is to be regretted,
however, that the effect is impaired by the rusty appearance of the
iron-work, -and, indeed, decay seems to be still going on, under
the paint, to an extent which deserves consideration. There is a
capacious glazed roof over the carriage-way leading up to the book-
iny-offices. The design is due to Mr. Brunel and Mr. M. D.
Wyatt conjointly. The Central Railway Station in New Street,
Birmingham, has also an immense roof. It is about 1,100 feet long,
205 feet wide, and 80 feet high, and spans the whole of the lines of
railway. It is built of great iron ribs, each having a cambered tie

rod held up by braces. The principals are 24 feet apart, and each of
thein weighs about 25 tons. Mr. Henry Baker was the designer.-
The Fenchurch-street Station of the Black wall Railway has been
enlarged.—The lines of rails are spanned by a wide roof, of which
thie termination takes the form of a large segmental pediment,
crowning the façade.—The Railway Station at the Crystal Palace,
which is of sonie extent, has been completed, and is marked by some
novelty of effect.—The alterations in the London Bridge Station
have been considerable, and the decorations of the booking-office of
the Crystal Palace line, in the fat style of treatment, are in very
good taste.-A large hotel has been built adjoining the Great
Northern Railway Station. The introduction of shutter-blinds to
every window throughout the height, gives the pile a very peculiar
effect. — The large stables near, are very plain, but ribt devoid of
expression.
In the Plaistow Marshes, on the North Bank of the Tharnes, the
Victoria Docks are in progress. 90 acres is the amount of water
surface at present being provided.
At Westminster, half of the intended bridge is being first under-
taken, by the side of the present bridge, the remaining half being to
be proceeded with after the removal of the present structure;- this
plan avoiding the expense of a temporary bridge. Sir Charles
Barry has, in the present case, adopted the Gothic style for his
design, in order that it might be accordant with the Houses of
Parliament. The number of arches is greater than might have
been expected ; there being seven principal arches, and two minor
arches on the Surrey side. The form is elliptical, and the centre
arch has a span of 121 feet, and a rise of 20 feet above the
level of Trinity datum, which itself is 18 feet above the line of
low water. The span and rise of the other arches diminish
gradually to each end of the bridge. The length of the whole
roadway is 914 feet, and the extreme width of the bridge will be
85 feet. The foundations of the bridge are to be built somewhat
in the same manner as those of the Chelsea Bridge,—that is to say
by enclosing an area by piles and plate-iron casing, driving timber
piles at short intervals over the area, and filling in with concrete,
for the support of layers of stone landings and granite slabs, on
which the pier is to be built. The centre arch will be about 5 feet
lower than that of the present bridge, and the roadway will be con-
siderably lower than the present one. The contract for the work
was taken at 201 0001. The works are being carried out under the
direction of Mr. Thomas Page.
We must conclude by requesting our readers to consider that our
object is mainly restricted to a search afier the general results of
progress, of which particular buildings are illustrations, and that we
are necessarily obliged to omit mention of some deserving works.

Franklin and his companions in the Arctic Expedition, published in the

and • Terror' were crushed by icebergs in 1850. Sir John and forty of
his companions were seen by the Esquimaux, near King William's Land,
travelling afoot, and dragging a boat over the ice. The bodies of most
of the party, according to the account given by the Esquimaux, were
subsequently found near the Back River, surrounded by evidence that
they had been driven to cannibalism to prolong their existence. Dr.
Rae brought to London several articles which he purchased from the
Esquimaux, and which were recognised as having belonged to Sir John
Franklin or his companions. The Doctor was commissioned by Govern-

XV. THE CAMPAIGN.
“ WHEN men change swords for ledgers,” it is a time, according to
the poetical faith, when he who feels for his country
as a lover'
should have “ some fears unnained.” During a peace of nearly
forty years we had made this change, apparently, a permanent one.
We might have had our Indian wars. our China war, and our African
wars, over again, and the nation would never have thought that the
ledger had been changed for the sword. A great European war-
greater in its preparations, greater in its possible results, than any
in which this country has ever been engaged-has buist forth like
the eruption of a volcano. Has the generation that has grown under
the influence of the ledger any fears of the change which is the
converse of that dreaded by the poet? Has it lost any of that
national spirit, that hatred of inordinate anıbition, that sympaihy
with heroic action, which belonged to the generation that lived forty
years ago under the influence of the sword ? Have the courage
and endurance which made the recluse who dreaded the enervaring
power of commerce and luxury, and despised the ascendan«y of
** monied worldlings," " ashamed even in the utterance of the re-
proach of his “unfilial fears,”-have these deparied from us? The
armoury of the invincible knights of old” still hangs in our halls.*
• The Companion to the Almanac' has been a peace annual since
its commencement twenty-seven years ago. It is a new function of
its Editor to trace the conduct of a mighty war. It has been his
duty, during that long period, to record à course of internal im-
provement and of growing prosperity, quite unequalled in the history
of our country. There never was so long a peace, and there never
was a period during which the resources of peace were so won-
drously developed. It is that astonishing development which has
enabled us to enter upon this great war with Russia, without any
doubt of our ability to maintain it till we have conquered security;
which satisfies us to pay for the war as it goes on without any bur-
then upon
the next race; which in a few months covered the North
and the East with armaments, compared to which the preparations
of the last great war were slow and feeble; which has given us the
most complete self reliance, and at the same time has commanded
the friendship of the one other great nation that has also profited by
the long suspension of ancient hostility, and has discovered, in
common with ourselves, that we are bound in niutual interests, and
are, of necessity, the joint conservators of European civilization and
progress.
One of the most remarkable circumstances connected with this
war has been the universality of the popular agreement as to its
justice and necessity. None of the usual motives were present to
stimulate this national feeling. There was no apprehension of an
invading power that might bring this worst horror to our own shores.
There was no desire for the acquisition of territory, for new havens
or new colonies. There was no discontent at home, to make a mis-

The Campaign.
judging government attempt “ to busy giddy minds with foreign
quarrel.” But there was a conviction, almost instinctive, that
during a quarter of a century there had been one European power
growing up, in steady preparation for long-cherished projects of
aggrandizement—a cold, calculating, tortuous power,– terrible in
the brute force of its military arm; and inaccessible in its proud
despotism to the controlling influence of public opinion. A great
American orator has said of this control of public opinion, that it
is “ able to oppose the most formidable obstruction to the progress
of injustice and oppression ; and, as it grows more intelligent and
more intense, it will be more and more formidable. It may be
silenced by military power, but it cannot be conquered. It is elastic,
irrepressible, and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary warfare.
It is that impassible, unextinguishable enemy of mere violence and
arbitrary rule which, like Milton's angels,
• Vital, in every part,
Can not, but by annihilating, die.'"
These glowing words of Daniel Webster, however true in general
cases, were inapplicable to a ruler of sixty millions of men, who
thought he might outrage the opinion of mankind with impunity, as
long as he could command an army numbering a million The Czar
of Russia felt that it was his mission to put down the empire of
opinion. He unveiled the hideous secrets of his diplomacy to the
Britannic ministers, and his project of bribing away our horror of
oppression was rejected and spat upon. He unveiled the same
secrets to France, and again he was rejected and despised. It was
his policy, not to go back into repose and mod ration, but to go
forward from fraud to violence. He occupied the Principalities, and
Great Britain and France began to arm.
In 1823, when George Canning addressed a public meeting at
Plymouth, he used these memorable words :-
“The resources created by peace are means of war. In cherishing
those resources we but accumulate those means. Our present repose
is no more a proof of inability to act, than the state of inertness and
inactivity in which I have seen those mighty masses that float in the
waters above your town, is a proof they are devoid of strength, and
incapable of being fitted out for action. You well know, gentlemen,
how soon one of those stupendous masses, now reposing on their
shadows in perfect stillness—how soon, upon any call of patriotism
or of necessity, it would assume the likeness of an animated thing,
instinct with life and motion-how soon it would ruffle, as it were,
its swelling plumage-how quickly would it put forth all its beauty
and its bravery, collect its scattered elements of strength, and
awaken its dormant thunder. Such as is one of these magnificent
machines when springing from inaction into a display of its might-
such is England herself, while, apparently passive and motionless,
she silently concentrates the power to be put forth on an adequate
occasion."
Thirty years had passed before that “ adequate occasion ” did
arise; but when it at last came, how grandly were these prophetic
words realised! There was the joint call of patriotism and of neces-

sity; and in a few months the “ scattered elements of strength "
were collected, and the “ dormant thunder" of fleets and armies
awakened. Whilst we write, the most tremendous conflict in which
this united strength of fleets and armies was ever employed in one
vast enterprise, is going forward ; and every boom of the guns on
the sea and shore of the Euxine makes the heart of England beat
with a quicker pulsation.
The declaration of war with Russia, which apppeared in the
• London Gazette of the 28th March 1854, contains a very clear
historical narrative of the course of events which had preceded that
momentous resolve. After detailing the nature of the petty differ-
ence of Russia with Turkey, as regarded the privileges of the Greek
Church at Jerusalem—which difference had been arranged through
the intervention of the British ambassador at Constantinople—the
declaration goes on to say that “ demands were made, which in the
opinion of the Sultan, extended to the substitution of the Emperor
of Russia's authority for his own, over a large portion of his subjects ;
and those demands were enforced by a threat: and when her Majesty
learnt that, on announcing the termination of his mission, Prince
Menschikoff declared that the refusal of his demands would impose
upon the imperial government the necessity of seeking a guarantee
by its own power, her Majesty thought proper that her fleet should
leave Malta, and, in co-operation with that of his Majesty the Emperor
of the French, take up its station in the neighbourhood of the Darda-
nelles. So long as the negotiation bore an amicable character, her Ma-
jesty refrained from any demonstration of force. But when, in addition
to the assemblage of large military forces on the frontier of Turkey,
the ambassador of Russia intimated that serious consequences would
ensue from the refusal of the Sultan to comply with unwarrantable
demands, her Majesty deemed it right, in conjunction with the
Emperor of the French, to give an unquestionable proof of her
determination to support the sovereign rights of the Sultan. The
Russian government has maintained that the determination of the
Emperor to occupy the Principalities was taken in consequence of
the advance of the fleets of England and France. But the menace
of invasion of the Turkish territory was conveyed in Count Nessel-
rode's note to Rechid Pacha of the 19th (31st) May, and restated
in his despatch to Baron Brunnow of the 20th May (1st June),
which announced the determination of the Emperor of Russia to
order his troops to occupy the Principalities, if the Porte did not,
within a week, comply with the demands of Russia. The despatch
to her Majesty's ambassador at. Constantinople, authorising him in
certain specified contingencies to send for the British feet, was
dated the 31st May, and the order sent direct from England to her
Majesty's admiral, to proceed to the neighbourhood of the Darda-
nelles, was dated the 2nd of June. The determination to occupy
the Principalities was, therefore, taken before the orders for the
advance of the combined squadrons were given.”
On the 2nd of July, 1853, the Russian armies crossed the Pruth
for the occupation of the Principalities. On the 27th of September,
the Porte declared war against Russia; and on the 1st of October,
L 3

The Campaign.
a
an appeal for material support was made by Turkey to France and
England. On the 27th of October, the Turks crossed the Danube,
opposite Widdin ; and, with greater force, on the 3rd of November.
Whenever the Russians attacked them, the Turks maintained their
positions with obstinate courage.
On the 30th of November, the Turkish fleet was destroyed in the
harbour of Sinope by the Russian fleet from Sebastopol. The narra-
tive of that destruction was so fuil of horrible circumstances, present-
ing the character of rather a cruel massacre than an equal battle, that
the indignation of this country was fairly roused. From that time the
sympathies of England were thoroughly with the weak and op-
pressed, the people of another faith that might be pitied, but could
no longer be despised. From the moment that Omer Pacha crossed
the Danube, it was clear that the ancient military spirit of the
Turk was not dead; and that “the sick man ” had woke up from
his long apathy, and would give some trouble to the bird of prey who
was looking out for the feast of his carcase. The battles in the
vicinity of Kalafat, in the beginning of Deceniber, avenged the
slaughter at Sinope.
The combined fleets of Great Britain and France entered the
Black Sea on the 3rd of December, on the demand of the Porte to
the ambassadors. The Russian fleet retired to the shelter of
Sebastopol, from which it never again stirred. On the 31st of
January, the Queen opened the British parliament, and announced
an augmentation of the naval and military forces. The Royal
Speech spoke of peace; ministers still talked of negotiations :
protocol after protocol came from Vienna; but there was one sig-
nificant fact in which men trusted more than in diplomacy. The
Queen led the first division of the Baltic fleet out to sea on the
11th of March ; and, on the 27th, a Royal message was sent to the
Lords and Commons “ that the negotiaiions in which her Majesty,
in concert with her allies, has for some time past been engaged with
his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, have terminated ; and
that her Majesty feels bound to afford active assistance to her ally
the Sultan, against unprovoked aggression.” These were formal
words, used in the utmost sobriety of official precedent. The
declaration of war that followed the next day is more emphatic :-
“ The time has now arrived when the advice and remonstrances
of the Four Powers having proved wholly ineffectual, and the
military preparations of Russia becoming daily more extended, it is
but too obvious that the Emperor of Russia has entered upon a
course of policy, which, if unchecked, must lead to the destruction
of the Ottoman Empire. In this conjuncture, her Majesty feels
called upon, hy regard for an ally, the integrity and independence
of whose empire have been recognised as essential to the peace of
Europe, by the sympathies of her people with right against wrong,
by a desire to avert_from her dominions niost injurious conse-
quences, and to save Europe from the preponderance of a Power
which has violated the faith of treaties, and defies the opinion of
the civilized world, to take up arms, in conjunction with the
Emperor of the French, for the defence of the Sultan. Her

Majesty is persuaded that, in so acting, she will have the cordial
support of her people ; and that the pretext of zeal for the Christian
religion will be used in vain to cover an aggression undertaken in
disregard of its holy precepts, and of its pure and beneficent spirit.
Her Majesty humbly trusts that her efforts may be successful, and
that, by the blessing of Providence, peace may be re-established on
safe and solid foundations.”
In looking back upon the course of the last war, no reader of
history can fail to trace the difficulties that were constantly arising
on the subject of neutral vessels. If there was danger then in the
enforcement of what was called “the right of search,” how far
greater wonld be the danger now when the ships of the United
States cover every sea! Wisely, therefore, was the declaration of
war accompanied with an additional declaration, which states that
the Queen having been compelled to take up arms in support of
an ally, is desirous of rendering the war as little onerous as possible
to the Powers with whom she remains at peace. To preserve the
commerce of neutrals from all unnecessary obstruction, her Majesty
is willing, for the present, to waive a part of the belligerent rights
appertaining to her by the law of nations. It is impossible for her
Majesty to forego the exercise of her right of seizing articles contra-
band of war, and of preventing neutrals from bearing the enemy's
despatches; and she must maintain the right of a belligerent to pre-
vent neutrals from breaking any effective blockade which may be
established with an adequate force against the enemy's forts, har-
bours, or coasts. But her Majesty will waive the right of seizing
enemy's property laden on buard a neutral vessel, unless it be con-
traband of war. It is not her Majesty's intention to claim the confisca-
tion of neutral property, not being contraband of war, found on board
enemy's ships; and her Majesty further declares that, being anxious
to lessen as much as possible the evils of war, and to restrict its
operations to the regularly.organised forces of the country, it is not
her present intention to issue letters of marque for the commissioning
of privateers.”
We thus entered upon a contest in which the strength of the
British empire was to be measured against that of a power, in some
respects the most formidable in the world. But that strength was to
be wielded in the heartiest conjunction with an ally that for
centuries has been regarded as our natural enemy. The immense
importance of the alliance, for rooting out whatever may remain, on
either side the Channel, of ancient prejudices; and for enabling
each country to combine its resources, so as to form a solid bulwark
against the power and preponderance of an empire that is essentially
adverse to human progress, cannot be too highly rated. We shall
have to trace the course of this union in a series of events which
will render the year 1854 as memorable as any period of British
history.
The first exploit in the Black Sea was the bombardment of
Odessa, on the 21st of April. A flag of truce had been fired upon
from the fort ; and the Russian commandant refused satisfaction

ping. The mole, the vessels of war, and the barracks were de-
stroyed by the fire from the English and French steam frigates.
The guns from the mole did little damage to the combined squadron ;
and the loss of men was exceedingly small. This success was fol-
lowed by an unfortunate accident. On the 12th of May, the
• Tiger,' an English steam frigate, ran aground near Odessa ; and,
being attacked by artillery from the town, was destroyed, and her
crew made prisoners. Her captain, Giffard, was wounded ; and
subsequently died. The ship was defenceless Her guns had
been thrown overboard to lighten her; and, as she lay crippled on
the shore, volley after volley of shells and red-hot shot were poured
into her. The** Niger' and · Vesuvius' came to the assistance of
the · Tiger ;' but they could not approach the shoal where she lay;
and although they fired upon the Russian force with considerable
execution, they properly and humanely left the Russians to remove
the crew, as their prisoners, from the burning vessel.
About the same period, a squadron, placed under the orders of
Sir E. Lyons and Viscount de Chabannes, visited the coast of
Circassia : and dislodged the Russians from their stronghold of
Redout Kaleh. This exploit was effected by the naval force in
conjunction with a body of Turkish infantry, which were landed
from the ships. The Circassians manifested the greatest joy at the
presence of the English and French, to whom they looked for a
deliverance from their oppressors.
While the allied armies were assembling at Gallipoli and Scutari,
in the vicinity of Constantinople; and while the combined naval
power in the Black Sea was blockading the Russian fleet in
Sebastopol, and orcasionally performing some bold exploit that
scarcely affected the general results of the war,—the great arma-
ment, under Sir Charles Napier, was sounding the perilous depths
of the Baltic, while the Russian navy was safe beyond the walls of
Cronstadt. It was now that the impatience of the British people
began to manifest itself in symptoms which were essentially charac-
teristic of the new state of affairs in which the country was placed.
The larger number of the existing generation had never lived in
the time of a great European war, in which we were called upon to
be foremost in the struggle. The alternations of hope and fear,
which waited upon the first years of this century, were remem
bered by few. The majority could only know by historical records
what the nation felt, when the first Napoleon looked upon England
from the heights of Boulogne; when the battle of Austerlitz de-
stroyed the frail web of continental alliance, and broke the stout
heart of William Pitt ; when the retreat to Corunna, and the last
perilous fight of him who there was “left alone with his glory,"
presaged the abandonment of the Spanish contest; when Vimiera
opened new hopes, to be swallowed up in disgust at the convention
of Cintra ; when, from the day of Talavera to that of Vittoria,
there were four long years of anxious conflict,-sustained and carried
to a glorious conclusion by one man,—often left without resources
by a feeble government,—not unfrequently misunderstood and
doubted by a complaining people. The state of war in which we

had so long lived, produced something approaching to indifference
as to the results amongst the great body of the population. They
were always, indeed, sound at heart, but they were not enthusiastic.
They did not watch the news of every morning with the feverish
impatience that belongs to the present time. There were no
electric telegraphic messages; no. special correspondents " in
camp or feet. When news came, it was in the form of an official
despatch of the most business-like character. The people read the
letters of the great Duke, and were not quite sure whether the
narrative of one who never fought in vain, was the announcement
of a victory. Let us see at what rate news travelled during the
last war. 'Badajoz was taken by storm on the 6th of April, 1812 ;
the news was published on the 24th. The great fight of Salamanca
took place on the 22nd of July, 1812 ; the aide-de-camp who
brought the despatch arrived at the War-office on the 16th of August.
A fortnight or three weeks was the usual interval between the
transmiss on and the receipt of a despatch from the Peninsular
army.. Compare this slowness of communication with the rapid
publicity of events at the present time. If we look at the difference
of distance between Badajoz and Sebastopol, we shall perfectly
estimate the scientific changes in our modes of communication-
steam-vessels, railroads, electric telegraphs—which have made Bala-
clava practically nearer to us than Oporto forty years ago.
During the long suspense in the movements of the combined
forces assembled in Turkey, the war on the Danube was proceeding
with unlooked-for success. On the 17th May the Russians invested
Silistria, a strong fortress on the Turkish frontier.
brought his thousands again and again to the assault during six
weeks. On the 13th an attack was made with an immense force,
and was repulsed; and on the 15th the Turks made a sortie which
drove the Russians across the Danube. There were two English
volunteers who greatly contributed to the triumph, Captain Butler
and Lieutenant Nasmyth. The first of these gallant young soldiers
was twice wounded, and finally died of exhaustion. The survivor
summed up the issue of the siege, in a letter to the • Times,' dated
June 29 :-" The Turkish army may well talk with pride. Their
opponents had an army on the right bank of the Danube, which at
one time amounted to 60,000 men. They had sixty guns in position,
and threw upwards of 50.000 shot and shell, besides an incalcalable
quantity of small-arm ammunition. They constructed more than
three miles of approaches, and sprang six mines; yet during forty
days not one inch of ground was gained, and they abandoned the
siege, leaving the petty fieldwork, against which their principal
efforts had been directed, a shapeless mass from the effects of their
mines and batteries, but still in possession of its original defenders.”
On the 18th May a Council of War was held at Varna, at which
Marshal St. Arnaud and Lord Raglan, the French and English com-
manders-in-chief of the forces which were in camp near Constan-
tinople, and Omar Pasha, were present. Orders were immediately
issued for a portion of the infantry to embark for Varna. A corre-
spondent of the Daily News' thus describes the state of the English

camp on the summits and sides of the hills :-" There is music and
merriment everywhere; shouts of laughter and cheers burst out
from one encampment after another; the band on the beach is
answered by the distant strains of a march played by a band in the
cypress grove; there are bugle calls from Selimieh, and the deep
booming of guns from over the water, where the forts salute some
vessel come in from the fleet. A small fleet of steamers and trans-
ports, twenty sail, lies off Selimieh, warning all beholders that this
scene of life and merriment is but a passing vision, and that the day
is at hand when the city of tents will be swept away_not leaving a
trace behind."
On the 24th May there was a great review in honour of the
Queen's birth-day. ** When, proceeding along the line from right
to left, the commander-in-chief had reached the centre, the troops
presented arnis, and the bands struck up God save the Queen.'
The solemn strains filled all hearts with an indescribable feeling of
pride and sadness. And when cheers, hearty, loud, and dealening,
burst from the mass, even the stoutest of those that were to remain
behind felt moved almost to tears. Many ladies wept and sobbed
outright. This cheering the Queen on foreign soil on the eve of a
long and hazardous campaign, suggested, nay, forced upon the by-
standers the thought of the danger and hardships which are in store
for these gallant men, near twenty thousand, and yet a mere handful
to the myriads that are under arms to oppose them. When the last
strains of the National Anthem had died away, the various regiments,
commencing with the Artillery and the Guards on the right, marched
past the commander-in-chief, who saluted each regiment as it passed.
Again the sound of the national melodies filled the air, and the
• British Grenadiers,' • The Roast Beef of Old England,' and ' Cheer,
Boys, Cheer,' recalled to the mind visions of that mighty island in
the western seas, the mother of many nations, who has now entered
into the great war for her own existence and the rights and liberties
of the European nations.”
The greater portion of the French and English troops disembarked
at Varna on the 29th May. “ Lines of Turkish soldiers were drawn
up on the jetty, and as fast as each batch of English arrived, their
oriental friends relieved them of their arms and knapsacks, and
assisted them in climbing up on the platform. The same aid was
rendered as regarded the baggage, which was immediately carried
off and packed in carts. As fast as each company disembarked, it
was formed on the quay, and marched off through the town to the.
place set apart for the encampment outside the Shumla gate. Every
one was astonished at the size and vigorous appearance of the men,
but, more than all, by the smartness of their clothing and equip-
ments."
Let us leave these gallant troops for awhile, who had heavy
suffering to endure before they quitted that camp at Varna, to en-
counter work which would sadly besmirch "the smartness of their
clothing and equipments." While they were yet inactive the fleet
in the Black Sea was doing good service, by the destruction of the
Russian batteries at the Sulina mouth of the Danube.

On the 15th July ten thousand French troops, destined for the
Baltic, embarked, at Boulogne, on board English ships of war. This
was a remarkable event, and the Emperor of the French judiciously
applied it in an address to the troops :-“ Soldiers, Russia having
forced us to war, France has armed five hundred thousand of her
children. England has called out a considerable number of troops.
To-day our fleets and armies, united for the same cause, dominate in
the Baltic as well as in the Black Sea. I have selected you to be
the first to carry our eagles to those regions of the North. English
vessels will convey you there; a unique fact in history, which proves
the intimate alliance of the two great nations (peuples), and the tirnı
resolution of the two governments not to abstain from any sacrifice
to defend the right of the weak, the liberty of Europe, and the
national honour."
While Napoleon III. was pointing to the English alliance, thus
practically manifested, as “an unique fact in history,” the Imperial
Parliament, which, whatever had been the mode in which the
ministerial measures had been attacked, had never complained of that
alliance,—was approaching to the end of the Session.' It had voted
money and arms with unhesitating confidence. Parliament was
prorogued on the 12th August by the Queen in person; and it is
said that the inspiriting voice, always beautiful and well modulated,
was more than usually emphatic in uitering these words :—" In
cordial co-operation with the Emperor of the French, my efforts
will be directed to the effectual repression of that ambitious and
aggressive spirit on the part of Russia, which has compelled us to
take up arms in defence of an ally, and to secure the future tran-
quillity of Europe."
Parliament had been prorogued before the intelligence arrived of
the most marked event of the Baltic expedition-the capture of the
strong fortress of Bomarsund on one of the Aland islands. The
chief fort was a structure of granite, about forty feet in height, and
mounting from eighty to a hundred guns, whose fire would sweep
the bay. The land rose above this fort, and the crests of the low
hills were fortified by three round granite towers. There were also
earth-works. On the evening of the 7th August when the fleet
was in the bay, out of reach of the fire, and the transports had
arrived, the boats were all got out; three steam-vessels sounded the
passage to the western shore ; and in the early light of the northern
summer morning, ten thousand French soldiers were embarked in
these boats, and were sately landed by eight o'clock. For several
days the soldiers were encamped on this western shore, while twelve
hundred marines of both nations had landed on the north of the
island, where they were busied till the 15th in erecting a battery.
Over four or five miles of difficult ground were the guns from the
ships dragged up to the battery by the untiring sailors. On the
13th the French commenced the bombardment of the western tower;
and the chasseurs, hanging upon the rocks which commanded the
fort, poured in through the embrasures such a destructive fire from
their Minié rifles, that the Russians could scarcely stand to their
guns. The English, meanwhile, were battering the Eastern tower;

and the western face of the large fort was under the constant fire of
a 10-inch gun, landed from the Pelham,' and from the ships which
threw shot and shells upon the fort. On the 16th the garrison sur-
rendered, with two thousand prisoners.
The details of this enterprise produced a singular effect upon the
British public. Burarsund was built of granite : Bomarsund had
fallen; the granite was not impregnable; why is Cronstarit spared ?
The English Heet and the French troops were destined to leave the
Baltic without accomplishing the work which public opinion de-
manded, the “ wish” being " father to the thought.” We had to
learn, after the experience of a little month, that granite forts are
only to be thrown down by unremitting toil, by experienced science,
by calculating forethought--amidst privation, and sickness, and
laments for the fallen. These evils appal not the brave heart that
is familiar with such labours and miseries ; but they teach stern truths
in sad realities, which we are apt to forget in our mere historical
reading, but which come home to our understandings when the veil
is removed from the generalisations of a campaign by the vivid
sketches of " our special correspondent.”
The months of July and August were months of dire calamity for
the allied armies on the shores of the Black Sea, and for the fleet at
Baltchik Bay. The mortality from cholera was terrible. Our men
were, in some cases, dreadfully iinprudent, eating cucumbers and
water-melons, and drinking peach-brandy without any self-control.
In the feet the disease was equally severe, and the attendant cir.
cumstances were, in some degree, more horrible.
The fêtes at Boulogne at the beginning of September, when
Prince Albert was the guest of the French emperor, were a neces-
sary and fitting result of the national alliance. This meeting was
not an improper prelude to that compact between two armies, which
was ratified on the bloody field of the Alına.
The final order for the embarkation of the British troops from
Varna was issued on the 3rd of September. The minute details
of the instructions are alone sufficient to give a notion, not only of
the magnitude of the enterprise, but of the number of conditions
which were necessary to avert calamity, if not to insure success.
That enterprise was truly called by the commander-in-chief,
operation of much difficulty.” There was to be no hurried rush
from the ships to the boats, and from the boats to the shore. The
troops were to enter the boats in the order in which they stand in
the ranks. They were to take their places in perfect silence. On
landing, they were to form in continuous columns. They were not
to load till they were landed, and not then till they were ordered.
The boats were to form in line, abreast, and to pull into the shore
stoutly and steadily, in perfect silence. Three days' provisions
were to be carried individually both by officers and men. Thus
was the order of battle formed before the landing; and the troops
were ready to encounter the enemy had he met them on the shore.
It is clear that such an encounter was expected. The voyage from
Varna to some landing-place, not distant from Sebastopol, was
regulated by the same clear directions for the conduct of the ships-

W
of-war and the transports. The coast had been previously surveyed
by the generals. The account of the embarkation from Varna has
been given by an eye-witness, in a letter dated September 4th :-
“ The embarkation has been going on for more than a week, and
such a scene I never before witnessed, nor indeed has any one here,
for the expedition is on a more gigantic scale than any ever before
attempted. Independently of our fleets, the hired steam-fleet is
the wonder of every one. These are filled with troops and stores.
The Himalaya, Simla, Jason, and Victoria, have each more than a
regiment of dragoons on board. Every large steamer has its regi-
ment of nearly 800 strong, while others are filled with stores of
every description. The scene in Varna bay, during the whole of
the last ten days, has been one of unparalleled magnificence, and
exciting in the extreme. On one steam-tug you will see artillery
wending their way to their ships; then an infantry regiment crammed
on board a sinali Danubian steamer, puffing along to a transport
with its living cargo. On the way, a ship, with her troops already
embarked, is passed, and then there is such a cheer set up-and so
shipload after shipload is embarked; and at this hour the last corps
are awaiting the return of the tugs to be taken on board."
This mighty armament, which alone gave the assurance that we
had not forgotten the advice of Wellington, “never make a little
war,” has been compared with similar preparations of ancient and
modern times. Those who foretold disaster would turn to the
graphic narrative of Thucydides, of the Athenian expedition
against Syracuse, when the armament that left the Piræus, “ was
no less noised for the strange boldness of the attempt, and glorious-
ness of the show, than for its superiority over those against whom it
was to go.” Those who looked for hopeful parallels turned to
Gibbon's majestic relation of the expedition of Belisarius against
Africa, when “ five hundred transports, navigated by twenty thou-
sand mariners of Egypt, Cilicia, and lonia, were collected in the
harbour of Constantinople, escorted by ninety-two light brigan-
tines.” Some thought of the Spanish Armada, with its great and
little galleons—its twenty-one thousand soldiers, and its three thou-
sand guns. All these instances would give no proportionate parallel
to the expedition against Sebastopol, even if the tonnage of the
fleets and the number of the men had been more equal. The great
characteristic of this armament was, that the power of steam gave a
-precision and security to the operation, which no previous effort of
combined naval and military warfare had ever been able so effectually
to command.
The disembarkation at Old Fort, about thirty miles from Sebas-
topol, was completed on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of September, a
beavy swell having impeded the landing of the guns and cavalry.
The greater part of the infantry stepped on the shore of the Crimea
on the 14th. The correspondent of the “Times' gives a picture
which will find a place in history as surely as the leap on British
ground of Cæsar's standard bearer. “As each man came creeping
down the ladder, Jack helped him along tenderly from rung to rung
till he was safe in the boat; took his firelock and stowed it away;

removed his knapsack and packed it snugly under the seat; patted
him on the back, and told him not to be afeerd on the water;'
treated the sojer, in fact, in a very kind and tender way, as
though he were a large but not very sagacious pet, who was not to
be frightened or lost sight of on any account; and did it all so
quickly, that the large paddle-box boats, containing one hundred
men, were filled in five minutes. Then the latter took the paddle-box
in tow, leaving her, however, in charge of a careful coxswaint, and
the same attention was paid to getting the 'sojer' on shore that was
evinced in getting him into the boat; the sailors, (half or wholly
naked in the surf), standing by at the bows, and handing each man
and his accoutrement down the plank to the shingle, for fear · he'd
fall off and hurt himselt.' Never did men work better than our
blue-jackets; especially valuable were they with horses and artillery,
and iheir delight at having a horse to hold and to pat all to them-
selves was excessive. When the gun-carriages stuck fast in the
shingle, half a dozen herculean seamen rushed at the wheels, and,
with a 'Give way, my lads-all together !' soon spoked it out with
a run, and landed it on the hard sand. No praise can do justice to
the willing labour of those fine fellows. They never relixed their
efforts as long as man or horse of the expedition remained to be
landed; and many of them, officers as well as men, were twenty-
four hours in their boats.”
The landing of the French was accomplished the same day “ with
prodigious celerity and mathematical precision.".
The English and French armies nioved out of their first encamp-
ment on the 19th September. They marched onward under a
burning sun, and without water till they reached the little stream of
the Bulganac. On that day there was a skirmish between our light
cavalry and a party of Russian dragoons and Cossacks. The armies
bivouacked for the night on the left bank of the Bulganac, the
Russians having retired behind the heights. Here is a camp-
picture, which has some resemblance to the historical and poetical
descriptions of the night before Agincourt. “Immediately the
Russians had finally reuired beyond the heights, orders were given
to halt and bivouac for the night, and our tired men set to work to
gather the weeds for fuel. As soon as the rations of rum and meat
were served out, the casks were broken up, and the staves served
to make fires for cooking, aided by nettles and long grass. At
night the watchfires of the Russians were visible on our lett. Great
numbers of stragglers came up during the night, most of them
belonging to the fourth division. The night was cold and damp,
the watch-fires were mere flashes, which gave little heat, and
barely sufficed to warm the rations. All night arabas were arriving,
and soldiers who had fallen out or got astray, came up to the sentries
to find their regiments. Sir George Brown, Sir De Lacy Evans,
the brigadier-generals, and staff officers, went about among their
divisions and brigades ere the men lay down, giving directions for
the following day, and soon after dusk were on the ground, wrapped
up in great coats and blankets to find the best repose they could
after the day's exertion."

The Campaign.
Before daybreak of the 20th, the whole of the British force was
under arms, silently marshalled without drum or bugle. The two
armies marched on towards the Alma, where the Russians had taken
up their position. It is thus clearly described in Lord Raglan's
despatch :
" It crossed the great road about two and a quarter miles from the
sea, and is very strong by nature.
“ The bold and almost precipitous range of heights, of from 350
to 400 feet, that from the sea closely horder the left bank of the
river here ceases and formed their left, and turning thence round a
great amphitheatre or wide valley, terminates at a salient pinnacle
where their right rested, and whence the descent to the plain was
more gradual. The front was about two miles in extent.
“ Across the mouth of this great opening, is a lower ridge at
different heights, varying from 50 to 150 feet, parallel to the river,
and at distances from it from 600 to 800 yards.
“ The river itself is generally fordable for troops, but its banks
are extremely rugged, and in most parts steep; the willows along it
had been cui down, in order to prevent them from affording cover
to the attacking party, and, in fact, everything had been done to
deprive an assailant of any species of shelter.
“ In front of the position on the right bank, at about 200 yards
from the Alma, is ihe village of Bouliouk, and near it a timber
bridge, which had been partly destroyed by the enemy.
“The high pinnacle and ridge before alluded to was the key of
the position, and, consequently, there the greatest preparations had
been made for defence.
“Half way down the height, and across its front, was a trench of
the extent of some hundred yards, to afford cover against an advance
up the even steep slope of the hill. On the right, and a little retired,
was a powerful covered battery, armed with heavy guns, which
flanked the whole of the right of the position.
Artillery, at the same time, was posted at the points that best
commanded the passage of the river and its approaches gene-
rally.
" On the slopes of these hills (forming a sort of table land) were
placed dense masses of the enemy's infantry, whilst on the heights
above was his great reserve, the whole ainounting, it is supposed, to
between 45,000 and 50,000.”
Such was the position, supposed to be unassailable, which Prince
Menschikoff had taken up. The calm narrative of Lord Raglan goes
on to describe the attack of the combined armies, which arrived on
the Alma about noon. The passage of the river was to be effected,
by an army whose line extended for three miles, in the face of those
batteries, and that scattered artillery, and those dense masses of
infantry, which covered the hills. “On approaching near the fire
of the guns” (says Lord Raglan's despatch), " which soon became
extremely formidable, the two leading divisions deployed into line,
and advanced to attack the front; and the supporting divisions fol-
lowed the movement. Hardly had this taken place, when the village
of Bouliouk, immediately opposite the centre, was fired by the enemy

at all points, creating a continuous blaze for 300 yards, obscuring
their position, and rendering a passage through it impracticable.
Two regiments of Brigadier-General Adams's brigade, part of Sir
De Lacy Evans's division, had, in consequence, to pass the river at
a deep and difficult ford to the right, under a sharp fire; whilst his
first brigade, under Major-General Pennefather, and the remaining
regiment of Brigadier-General Adams, crossed to the left of the con-
Aagration, opposed by the enemy's artillery from the heights above,
and pressed on towards the left of their position, with the utmost
gallantry and steadiness. In the meanwhile, the Light Division
under Sir George Brown effected the passage of the Alma in his
immediate front. The banks of the river itself were, from their
rugged and broken nature, most serious obstacles; and the vineyards
through which the troops had to pass, and the trees which the enemy
had felled, created additional impediments, rendering every species
of formation under a galling fire nearly an impossibility.” Of him-
self, the brave and sagacious commander says not a word. The
omission was supplied by Marshal St. Arnaud, who said “ his bravery
rivalled that of antiquity.”
While the British were thus engaged on the left of the line, the
French were equally triumphant on the right. “At six o'clock in
the evening,” says Marshal St. Arnaud, " we encamped on the very
bivouac of the Russians.” The comparative merits and peculiar
characteristics of the two armies, have been thus truthfully summed
up :-" There is this very peculiar feature about the action—that
we had the very thing to do which we alone could have done, and
that the French had to do work for which they were particularly
suited. Ours it was to face steadily the fire of tremendous batteries ;
to advance with a rush, steady and sure, and resistless as the swell
of the ocean, against a wall of fire and solid masses of infantry; to
struggle on, at one time overwhelmed by crashing volleys of grape
and musketry, at another disorganised by round shot, winning the
ground from death at every pace: to form tranquilly and readily
when thrown into momentary disorder, and at last to nail victory to
our colours by the never-failing British bayonet. On the oiher
hand, the French had to scale the sides of steep ravines covered
with dense masses of infantry, supported by clouds of skirmishers;
they had to clamber up rocky steeps defended by swarms of sharp-
shooters: they had to gain a most difficult position with quickness
and alacrity. Delay would have been fatal ; slowness of movement
would have lost us the battle, for without the French on the heights
on our right we must have been driven across the Alma, as they
would have been swept into the valley had we failed in carrying our
batteries. Their energetic movements. their rapid flame-like spread
from crag to crag, their ceaseless fusillade of the deadly rifle, were
all astonishing, and paralysed the enemy completely. We, perhaps,
could never have made such a rapid advance, or have got over so
much ground in the same time.”
The two days of September, on which the allies rested on the
ground won by their heroism, were days in which some of the ter-
rible horrors of war were unveiled to those who sat at home, secure
from such forms of human suffering. But at home there was also

sudden death and sorrow. A pestilence was in our towns, which was
committing ravages as fearful as those of war. Nevertheless, almost
every other thought was absorbed in reading of a battle-field, where
the honoured dead were duly buried by their surviving friends ;
whence the wounded were borne, with few comforts and appliances
to the succouring ships ; but where thousands of Russians lay un-
buried on the hills, and their wounded were left to perish by their
countrymen who had fled. In those terrible hours, the sanctity of
human life was respected by the children of that land in which
bloodshed is held in more than common awe,—the dying Russian
found a friend and a consoler in the enemy who had struck him to
the earth. Merciful and just were the orders of the British com-
manders to spare life and to defend property. In all the records of
heroic action, there is nothing more touching than the incident of
the self-devoting English surgeon, who, with one sole attendant,
was left behind to administer to the wants of the wounded foe,
Mr. Thompson did his noble work; and then went to his “exceeding
great reward.”
Forward marched the victorious armies. But they marched not in
the direction which appeared to be marked out for them-to the
northern side of Sebastopol. They had gone right onward to meet
their entrenched enemy -
“ Firm, and unmoved
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat."
There was no enemy now in their path ; but they turned aside to
perform an operation of strategy, which necessarily changed the
previous plan of attack, and which required the promptitude and
boldness which are the great essentials of all enterprise to be car-
ried through with success. There was a little port on the south of
Sebastopol, which would open a safe communication between the land-
forces and the feet. Balaclava might be secured. The country on
the left of the great road to Sebastopol was unknown.
It was
covered with woods; and the allies had to march, without map or
guide, by the direction of the compass. For fourteen hours they
pursued their dir way, without rest, without water. Balaclava was
at length safely reached. The Russians, in great force, had filed
before them. By an act of daring on the part of a young naval
officer, who carried Lord Raglan's instructions to Sir E. Lyons, the
fleet at the same time appeared off the rock-bound harbour. Its
forts were easily subdued ; and on the 26th September, that ground
was occupied, which, for many succeeding weeks, was watched with
intense interest by the people of every land.
Signally triumphant as these efforts of courage and skill have been,
there has also been disappointment at home. Through some un-
explained freak of that wilful goddess Rumour, Sebastopol fell on the
first march from the Alma. How truly does Shakspere's descrip-
tion of this mischief-worker apply to those confident delusions that
filled the public mind at the beginning of October ! —
“ I, from the orient to the drooping west,
Making the wind my post horse, still unfold
The acts commenced in this ball of earth:
U pon my tongues continual slanders ride;
The which in every language pronounce,
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.”

A week or two, however, worked a salutary change in the public
temper. Expectation became more rational. Those who predicted
a war of danger and difficulty ceased to be regarded as traitors or
cowards. On the other hand, those who counselled acquiescence in
the designs of Russia—a presumptuous few, blinded by their own
vanity—were left to the contempt of a high-minded people, who
had not yet learnt that the counsels that have been mistakenly called
utilitarian, were to be the only safe guides of national honour, The
British people know that, well as the commercial spirit has worked
in its own proper region, it has chiefly worked effectually because it
has grown up with the long.cherished traditions of a manly race, in
whom the hatred of oppression, and resistance to the oppressor is
instinctive. It is the proper business of those who believe them-
selves the exclusive advocates of peace, to seek peace through the
continued cultivation of the peaceful virtues at home. There can be
no evil of war so great as the suspension of plans that advance the
domestic condition of the people. The heroism--which is only
another name for the highest moral elevation--which is called out
by war in strong resistance, in patient endurance, in efforts of bene-
volence, has a real tendency to elevate the national character, if
rightly understood. Tiere is sorrow and there is suffering enough
to be averted and mitigated at home; there is a fight to be fought
with evil influences and corrupt associations in cities as well as in
camps; there is brotherhood and kindness to be shown as well in
the factory as in the battle-field. When we find those who de-
nounce the war as antichristian practically striving with neglects
and oppressions at home which are equally antichristian, we may
have some hope that the great cause is going forward which will
gradually remove war and all other moral evil from the earth. But
the mere denunciation, upon the principle of expediency, of a war
which the almost universal consent of the people has received as just
and necessary, can only bring upon the denouncer the reproach that
was once applied to England herself — that, in the apathy of
avarice,”
serene thou hast stood,
“ And heard the loud yellings of famine and blood.”
Onward marched the allied armies to occupy the mountainous
ridges in the vicinity of Balaclava. Before them was Sebastopol, at
the distance of nine miles. The allied fleets were in the offing ; but
the harbour of Sebastopol was shut against them. With a boldness
of resolve which has much of the grand and terrible in it, seven
great ships of Russia had been sunk at the mouth of the harbour.
The road-way was impassable. They occupied the principal chan-
nel : and the hostile fleets could only fight in shoal-water. The con-
sequences were soon felt. Meanwhile, many of the gallant men
who had escaped the fire of the enemy at Alma perished under the
attacks of the more deadly enemy, cholera. “ They have been pur-
sued by cholera to the very battle-field,” said Lord Raglan. They
were pursued by cholera during the short rest on that battle-field;
through that march of fourteen hours to Balaclava ; through days
and nights of severe labour during the first operations of the siege ;

to the very trenches that were sheltering them from the guns of a
hundred e:nbrasures. Never was a little army more wasted than the
British before Sebastopol; and never did a remnant of men who had
gone forth to fight with the hope of sure and speedy triumph, bear
disease, privation, and loss in deadly encounters, with greater power
of endurance and unflinching devotion to duty.
The great attack upon Sebastopol commenced on the 17th Octo-
ber. It was a united operation by land and sea, of the combined
armies and fleets. It was not a success. The siege operations, full
of difficulty, have been well described by the French commander,
General Canrobert :-
“ The diffculties which we meet are of two kinds,—those which
result from the nature of the soil, the solid stratum of which,
already insufficient, diminishes in proportion as we approach the
place; and those resulting from the number and calibre of the pieces
of artillery which the enemy plants against us almost in a right and
very extended line. In this respect, the resources which he draws
from his vessels stationed in the port-men as well as materials—are
almost inexhaustible; while ours, although augmented by the loans
which we make from the two fleets, are necessarily limited. The 68-
pounders, the 80-howitzers, and the 12-inch mortars, are, in short,
almost the only artillery upon which we can rely. This position renders
the siege of Sebastopol one of the most laborious operations which have
been met with for a long time; and the efforts which we are compelled
to make to carry them into effect will explain the delays that have
arisen."
In spite of these difficulties the works had so advanced that it was
determined to open fire on the 17th. The English were on the
right, the French on the left. It was soon discovered that the
French works were somewhat weak. Explosions took place in their
magazines. The British land attack seems to have been more effec-
tive; and the Russian fort, known as the Round Tower, was demo-
lished. Our loss on land was not very severe, On the same day
the attack by sea took place. This combined attack gave a new
proof of the difficulties that waited upon the bombardment of granite
forts by vessels of war. The correspondent of the Times' says,
** It is now established beyond doubt, that the greatest defence of the
sea-forts of Sebastopol is the shallow water, which does not allow a
close enough approach to make ships' broadsides really formidable to
them. The fact is very simple—a ship’s broadside can produce a more
formidable concentrated fire than any fort in the world, but ships' sides
cannot resist fire so long. The closer, therefore, a ship comes to the
battery, the greater becomes its advantage; whereas its own danger
decreases, from the forts not being able to depress their guns enough
to hit the hull. An excellent proof of this latter fact, namely, that
the danger of a vessel decreases by nearer approach, was furnished
by the Agamemnon and the Sanspareil. Alihough not more than
200 yards from each other, the Agamemnon, which was closer in,
suffered much less, vessel as well as crew; and then most of the
shots fired into the Agamemnon damaged the rigging, while the
Sanspareil suffered chiefly in her hull. The Russians have been perą

fectly aware of this. They sank, therefore, a number of vessels before
the entrance of the harbour, in a line from the shoal running out
from Cape Constantine down to another shoal or reef, running out
from the point opposite, on which Fort Alexander is built.”
The siege steadily proceeded to the 25th October, when the third
parallel of the allies had approached within 200 metres (218 yards),
of the place. Many parts of the town were in flames; and the re-
ports of the amount killed within the walls were appalling. The
works carried forward by the British appear to have corresponded
in their solidity and efficiency with the character of our forces, and
of our field-operations.
The 25th of October was a glorious though disastrous day for the
allied armies, and especially for the British cavalry. At an early
hour of that morning, the Russians attacked the position in the front
of Balaclava. In the despatch from Lord Raglan, he says, “ The
low range of heights that runs across the plain, at the bottom of
which the town is placed, was protected by four small redoubts
hastily constructed. Three of these had guns in them; and on a
higher hill, in front of the village of Camara, in advance of our
right flank, was established a work of somewhat more importance.
These several redoubts were garrisoned by Turkish troops, no other
force being at my disposal for their occupation. The 93rd High-
landers was the only British regiment in the plain, with the excep-
tion of a part of a battalion of detachments composed of weakly
men, and a battery of artillery belonging to the Third Division ; and
on the heights behind our right were placed the Marines.”
Let us turn to the graphic details of this day, furnished by the
• Times' correspondent, who saw the whole course of the headlong
fight. Six compact masses of Russian infantry, which had just
debouched from the mountain passes, were slowly advancing up the
valley, with a regular line of artillery in their front. In advance of
them, about a mile, were two batteries of light guns, which were
playing on the redoubts garrisoned by the Turks. Behind these
guns were enormous masses of cavalry, in six compact squares, with
clouds of mounted skirmishers, in front of their march. The first
redoubt was carried, and the Turks fled. The second redoubt was
taken, and its guns turned against the flying Moslem. They aban-
doned their posts too quickly to receive any help. The Russians
advance upon the Highlanders, calmly waiting their approach ; our
cavalry are out of the enemy's view. As the enemy approaches,
the Highlanders fire, but the distance is too great for execution.
" The Russians sweep onwards with the whole force of horse and
man, through the smoke, here and there knocked over by the shot
of our batteries above. With breathless suspense every one awaits
the bursting of the wave upon the line of Gaelic rock; but ere they
come within 150 yards, another deadly volley flashes from the
levelled rifle, and carries death and terror into the Russians. They
wheel about, open files right and left, and fly back faster than they
• Bravo Highlanders! well done,' shouted the excited
spectators; but events thicken.' The storm is now to be borne by
the British cavalry. “ The Russianşi advanced, down the hill at a

slow canter, which they change to a trot, and at last nearly halted.
Their first line was at least double the length of ours—it was three
times as deep. Behind them was a similar line, equally strong and
compact. The trumpets rang again through the valley, and the
Grays and Enniskilleners went right at the centre of the Russian
cavalry. The Russian line brings forward each wing as our cavalry
advance, and threaten to annihilate them as they pass on. Turning
a little to their left, so as to meet the Russian right, the Grays rush
on with a cheer that thrills to every heart—the wild shout of the
Enniskilleners rises through the air at the same instant.
As light-
ning flashes through a cloud, the Grays and Enniskilleners pierce
through the dark masses of Russians. The shock was but for a
moment. There was a clash of steel and a light play of sword-
blades in the air, and then the Grays and the red-coats disappear in
the midst of the shaken and quivering columns. In another moment
we see them emerging and dashing on with diminished numbers,
and in broken order, against the second line, which is advancing
against them as fast as it can to retrieve the fortune of the charge.
It was a terrible moment. • God help them ! they are lost!' was
the exclamation of more than one man, and the thought of many.
With unabated fire the noble hearts dashed at their enemy-it was
a fight of heroes. The first line of Russians which had been smashed
utterly by our charge, and had fled off at one flank and towards the
centre, were coming back to swallow up our handful of men. By
sheer steel and sheer courage, Enniskillener and Scot were winning
their desperate way right through the enemy's squadrons, and already
Gray horses and red-coats had appeared right at the rear of the
second mass, when, with irresistible force, like one bolt from a bow,
the 1st Royals, the 4th Dragoon Guards, and the 5th Dragoon
Guards rushed at the remnants of the first line of the enemy, went
through it as though it were made of pasteboard, and dashing on
the second body of Russians, as they were still disordered by the
terrible assault of the Grays and their companions, put them to uiter
rout.”
The loss in this brilliant triumph was not severe on our part.
Would that the sun had set on that " well-foughten field” without
another encounter! When the enemy's horse had fled, an order
was sent from Brigadier Airey to Lord Lucan to advance his cavalry
nearer to the enemy, who had formed again upon their own ground,
with artillery in front and upon their Aanks. Lord Raglan says,
“ from some misconception of the instruction to advance, the
Lieutenant-General considered that he was bound to attack at all
hazards, and he accordingly ordered Major-General the Earl of
Cardigan to move forward with the Light Brigade.” Disastrous
was the issue. The brigade numbered only 607 sabres.
could scarcely believe the evidence of our senses ! Surely that
handful of men are not going to charge an army in position ? They
advanced in two lines, quickening their pace as they closed towards
the enemy-a more fearful spectacle was never witnessed. At the
distance of 1,200 yards the whole line of the enemy belched forth,
from 30 iron mouths, a flood of smoke and flame through which

hissed the deadly balls. The flight was marked by instant gaps in
our ranks, by dead men and horses, by steeds flying wounded or
riderless across the plain. The first line is broken, it is joined by
the second, they never halt or check their speed an instant; with
diminished ranks, thinned by those 30 guns which the Russians
had laid with the most deadly accuracy, with a halo of flashing steel
above their heads, and with a cheer which was many a noble
feilow's death-cry, they flew into the smoke of the batteries; but ere
they were lost from view, the plain was strewed with their bodies
and with the carcasses of horses. They were exposed to an oblique
fire from the batteries on the hills on both sides, as well as to a
direct fire of musketry. Through the clouds of smoke we could see
their sabres flashing as they rode up to the guns and dashed between
them, cutting down the gunners as they stood. The blaze of their
steel, as an officer standing near me said, was like the turn of a
shoal of mackerel.' We saw them riding through the guns, as I
have said : to our delight we saw them returning, after breaking
through a column of Russian infantry, and scattering them like chatt,
when the flank fire of the battery on the bill swept them down,
scattered and broken as they were. Wounded men and dismounted
troopers flying towards us told the sad tale-demi-qods could not
have done what we had failed to do. At the very moment when
they were about to retreat, an enormous mass of Lancers was hurled
on their Aank. Colonel Shewell, of the 8th Hussars, saw the
danger, and rode his, few men straight at them, cutting his way
through with fearful loss. The other regiments turned and engaged
in a desperate encounter. With courage too great almost for credence,
they were breaking their way through the columns which enveloped
them, when there took place an act of atrocity without parallel in
the modern warfare of civilized nations. The Russian gunners, when
the storm of cavalry passed, returned to their guns. They saw their
own cavalry mingled with the troopers, who had just ridden over
them, and, to the eternal disgrace of the Russian name, the mis-
creants poured a murderous volley of grape and canister on the mass
of struggling men and horses, mingling friend and foe in one com-
mon ruin!" ()f the 607 who went into action, only 1.98 returned.
On the succeeding day a brilliant affair took place before Se-
bastopol. According to Lord Raglan's despatch :-“ The enemy
moved out of Sebastopol on the 26th with a large force of in-
fantry, cavalry, and artillery-amounting, it is said, to 6,000 or
7,000 men- and attacked the left of the Second Division, com-
manded by Lieutenant-General Sir De Lacy Evans, who speedily
and energetically repulsed them, assisted by one of the batteries of
the First Division and some guns of the Light Division, and sup-
ported by the brigade of Guards and by several regiments of the
Fourth Division, and in rear by the French Division, commanded by
General Bosquet, who was most eager in his desire to give him
During these conflicts the siege went steadily forward—with small
daily loss on our part, but with a serious diminution of our aggregate
force. Reduced in numbers, but with undiminished: courage, this
every aid."

“band of brothers" had again to fight a great battle with almost over-
whelming masses. This struggle has come to us in the telegraphic
dispatch of the French General Canrobert, dated November 6; and
in ihat of Lord Raglan, which was detained by the breaking of the
telegraph near Bucharest, by a storm. As the testimony of an ally,
we give in preference the despatch of General Canrobert :
“ The Russian army, swollen by reinforcements from the Danube,
as well as by the combined reserves of all the southern provinces,
and animated by the presence of the Grand Dukes Michael and
Nicholas, attacked yesterday the right of the English position before
Sebastopol.
“ The English army sustained this attack with the most remarka-
ble firmness and solidity: I supported it by a portion of General
Bosquet's division, which fought with admirable vigour, as well as
by the troops which were nearest to the English position.
“ The enemy, who far out-numbered our force, beat a retreat with
a loss estimated at from 8,000 to 9,000 men,
“ The struggle lasted the whole day.
“At the same time General Forey was forced to repulse a sortie
made by the garrison, and under his energetic command the enemy
were driven back into the place with a loss of 1,000 killed and
wounded.
“ This brilliant day, which was not purchased without consider-
able loss by the Allies, does the greatest honour to our arms."
The British soldier had again to assert the energy of a race born
to freedom, not enervated by the accumulations of the riches of
civilisation, against a people born to the sway of a despot, and
amongst whoin there are few gradations between nobility and
slavery. The necessary period of our publication interferes with
our waiting for the further details of this other battle of the 5th
November, which, whatever be its final results, leaves the British
character as unimpaired by a campaign of sickness and privation, and
bloody encounter, as when its numbers, twice as great, sailed from
the ports of England in the pride of native strength, and with
all the panoply of war, amidst prayers and blessings which could
only have proceeded from the voice of a nation that had no doubts
about the character of the coming struggle. Over and over again
have our allies characterised the heroic endurance of the British
army by one remarkable word, “ solidity.” It is our national charac-
teristic. Let it not be only the word which designates the bearing
of the British I soldier before an enormous amount of physical power,
but the bearir ig of the British people under every circumstance,
which can atte nd the fortunes of this great warfare.“ Solidity,” if
we triumph not moved to rash enterprise or vain boasting ;-
“solidity," if the campaign is ended as it has begun, with losses
and sorrows for which this generation was somewhat unprepared ;
"solidity,” in holding fast an alliance which, whatever be the results
of one campaign, is absolutely certain to place us upon a final vantage-
ground—because it is an alliance of principle and not of policy.

Policies in this Ofice are indisputable, except in cases of fraud.
Persons who have been seen by a Medical Officer of the Society are not required to
appear before the Directors
* Free Policies" are issued, at a small increased rate of Premium, which remain in
force although the life assured may go to any part of the world.
Policies do not become void by the Life assured going beyond the prescribed limits,
– so far as regards the interest of Third Parties-provided they pay the additional
Premium, so soon as the fact comes to their knowledge.
Parties Assuring within Six Months of their last Birthday are allowed a proportional
diminution in the Premium.
The tables are especially favourable to young and middle-aged Lives, and the Limits.
allowed to the assured, without extra charge, are unusually extensive.
Policies becoming Claims between the periods of Division are entitled to a Bonus, in
addition to that previously declared.
No charge is made for Policy Stamps.
Eighty per cent. of the Profits are divided at the end of every Five years among the
Assured. - At the first Division, to the end of 1849, the addition to the amount Assured
averaged above 50 per cent. on the Premiums paid.

The scale of premium: adopted by this: Office will be found of a very moderate
character, but at the same time quite adequate to the risk incurred.
Four.fifths, or 80 per cent. of the profits, are assigned to policies every fifth year ;
and may be applied to increase the sum insured; to an immediate payment in cash;
or to the reduction and ultimate extinction of future premiums.
One-third of the premium on insurances of $500 and upwards, for the whole term of
life, may remain as a debt upon the policy, to be paid off at convenience; or the
Directors will lend sums of £50 and upwards, on the security of Policies effected witlı
this Company for the whole term of life, when they have acquired an adequate value.
Security.
Those who effect insurances with this Company are protected by its subscribed
capital of 4750,000, of which nearly £140,000 is invested, from the risk incurred hy
members of mutual societies.
The satisfactory financial condition of the Company, exclusive of the subscribed and
invested capital, will be seen by the following statement :
At the close of the last financial year, the sums assured,
including bonus added, amounted to
£2,500,000
The Premium Fund to more than
800,000
And the Annual Income from the same source, to
109,000
Insurances without participation in profits, may be effected at reduced rates.

LIFE DEPARTMENT.-The important advantages offered by the plan and con-
stitution of the Life Department of this Society are :-
That Insurers are protected by a large invested capital, upon which there is no
interest to pay, and for which no deduction of any kind is made ; which enables the
Directors to give the whole of the profits to insuring members.
That the profits are divided annually amongst all members of five years' standing
and applied towards reducing Life Insurance to the lowest possible rates of premium.
The abatement of premium on all Policies of five years' standing was in 1842, 1843,
and 1844 at the rate of £45 per cent. in each year; in 1845, 1846, 1847, and 1848 £50
cent, in each year; and in 1849, 1850, 1851, 1852, 1853, and 1854 £52. 10s. per cent. in
each year; and it is expected that an equal abatement will in future be annually made.
Persons insuring their own lives, or the lives of others, may become members.
Persons who are willing to forego particiption in the profits can insure at a lower rate
than that charged to members.
The following table will show the effect of the reduction of premium made by the
Society on members' policies that have been five years in force :

This Society has now been established upwards of Forty-six Years, upon the prin-
ciples of MUTUAL ASSURANCE, during which period it has paid to claimants on
terminated Policies upwards of $3,500,000 sterling, in addition to which nearly One
Million and a Quarter sterling has been assigned by way of Bonuses ; while the Accumu-
lated Capital, for meeting existing engagements (and which is almost wholly invested
on Real and Government Securities), exceeds £2,000,000.
There is no Proprietary to divide with the Assured the profits of this Institution,
which is one of the very few purely Mutual Insurance Offices. In addition, however, to
the entire protits of the Society, persons effecting Insurances will be entitled to
participate in the Benefits to be derived from the Reserved Fund,
now amounting to
£20,570.6s lld., and which, while affording all the protection of a Proprietary Capital,
will at the same time increase instead of diminish their future Bonuses,
The rates of Premium are below those of most Insurance Offices, and under the age of
45 not less so than 10 per cent., a benefit in itself equivalent to an Annual Bonus.
One-half of the first five Annual Premiums may remain as a permanent charge upon
Policies granted for the whole duration of life.

Insurances are granted by this Society on buildings, goods, merchandise, and effects,
ships in port, barbour, or dock, from loss or damage by fire in any part of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
It is provided by the constitution of the Society that the Insured shall be free from
all responsibility; and to guarantee the engagements of the Office, a fund of £550,000
has been subscribed by a numerous and opulent Proprietary, which fund has been
further increased by the accumulation of an additional reserve, now amounting to
£96,800. Returns of Three-Fifths of the Profits of the Company are periodically made
to parties insuring, who have thus from time time received from the Society sums
amounting in the aggregate to nearly £380,000.
The rates of Premium are in no case higher than those charged by the other principal
Offices, making no returns to their Insurers.
The business of the Company exceeds £62,000,000, and, owing to the liberality with
which its engagements have been performed, is rapidly increasing, The duty paid to
Government for the year 1853 was $73,971'; and the Amount Insured on Farming
Stock was upwards of £8,974,629.
This Office is wholly distinct from the Life Office.

FIRE BRANCH.
Persons assured by this Company are not subject to any covenants or calls to make
good losses which may happen to themselves or others, nor do they depend upon an
uncertain fund or contribution, the Capital Stock of this Company being an unques-
tionable Security to the Assured in case of Loss or Damage by Fire.
LIFE BRANCH.
SPECIAL NOTICE.-STAMPS ON LIFE POLICIES NOT CHARGED.
Attention is directed to the fact, that, to a defined extent, Life Premiums are not
subject to Income Tax, and that in certain cases Life Policies are exempt from the new
Succession Duties.
The important advantages afforded by the Company in the Life Branch will include
the following, viz. :-
Ist. The Guarantee of an AMPLE CAPITAL and EXEMPTION of the ASSURED from
LIABILITY of PARTNERSHIP. The Assured never having to depend on an uncertain
fund, nor being in any way accountable for the payment of claims.
2nd. MODERATE PREMIUMS.-The TABLES of PREMIUMS avoid, on the one hand, an
UNNECESSARILY HIGH RATE of PSYMENT by the Assured ; on the other, the VANGER
RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE CHARGES.
3rd. LARGE PARTICIPATION of Profits by the ASSURED, amounting to TWO-THIRDS
of its net amount, which may be applied at the option of the Party effecting the As-
surance.- lst. By the immediate payment of the sum so apportioned ; 2nd. By an
equivalent reduction of the future premiums; or 3rd. By an equivalent increase of the
sum Assured ; 4th. SMALL CHARGE FOR MANAGEMENT.
The following results were shown in the Report to the Shareholders at the last
Annual Meeting, August, 1854 :
The Company has received, in Fire Premiums alone, during £.
the year 1853, no less than ...
112,564 4 4
The paid-up Capital at the date of Meeting was.
276,915 00
There is, in addition to this amount, a Surplus Fund (after
paying a dividend) of
57,658 14 6
Total paid-up and invested Capital. £334,573 14 6
Mem. The above amounts are irrespective of an ample Sum, kept apart, to cover the
Life Liabilities of the Establishment.
Extract from J. H. Hartnoll's Letter to the President of the Board of Trade.
I fear that the comments which have been made, from time to time, in the Post
Magazine on the success of the Royal Insurance Company, have had the mischievous
effect of creating a desire in many of the new Life Offices to try their luck' in the Fire
line. Several engraftments of the kind have already been made, others are announced,
and more are are privately talked of. The results that are exhibited in most of the
preceding summaries of accounts are not, however, very encouraging for such experie
ments. It is as hazardous to enter upon a Little Fire Insurance Business' as the good
old Duke used to say it was to enter upon a 'Little war.'
Extract from the Post Magazine, August 12, 1854.
The accounts show that its business was not procured by those laborious and costly
efforts by which New Insurance Companies frequently struggle to obtain a footing. To
the evidence of this success that has been afforded by the preceding analysis of the
Company's accounts may he added the statement, made by the Chairman in his Address,
that 'the present bonâ fide paid-up INVESTED Capital is very nearly Four HUNDRED
THOUSAND POUNDS,' and the declaration by the Manager, Mr. Percy M. Dove, that the
amount of Premiums this year will in all probability exceed £120,0001'

THE ENGLISH CYCLOPÆDIA
(BASED UPON THE PENNY CYCLOPÆDIA),
Illustrated with more than 5000 Wood Engravings.
CONDUCTED BY CHARLES KNIGHT.
In many
THE “ENGLISH CYCLOPÆDIA” is based upon “The Penny Cyclopædia of the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge." The Copyright of that great Work
being the property of Mr. Knight, he alone has the power of remodelling it throughout,
80 as to adapt the original materials to the present state of knowledge.
essential particulars these valuable materials have to be recast, so as to render the book
as perfect as possible. Although the cost of this remodelling must necessarily be great,
and the whole work has to be produced in an improved form, with new type, it is pub-
lished at a cheaper rate than the original.
It is a great satisfaction to the Proprietors and the Editor of “THE ENGLISH
CYCLOPÆDIA,” that the plan and execution of this great undertaking have received
the unqualified approbation of the most influential publications of our day; and they
have the pleasure to solicit the attention of their subscribers and the public to the
following extracts :-
From “ The Times” of October 12, 1854.
“ The four volumes now before us, constituting a portion of the English Cyclopædia
-the last experiment in this direction by Mr. Knight—are based upon their predeces-
sors of the Penny Cyclopædia, the materials of the old Work having been remodelled so
as to adapt them to the existing state of knowledge. Our first anxious question is, are
we to have the old story over again ? Before we pay our pence, may we be certain that
no clause will be necessary in our wills recommending our heirs piously to contribute
their subscriptions for the completion of the work thirty years hence? Are we to have
another cheap publication dragging its slow length along for fourteen years—for ten, or
even five ? We rejoice to state that the answer is, on the whole, satisfactory. Mr.
Knight has awakened to a sense of what is due to the general reader, and is about to
give him, if we may take his word for it, a book of universal knowledge, that shall not
require illimitable time to wade through it. His new plan, we are bound to say, is
excellent, and we entreat liim to adhere to it without burdening us with any supple-
mentary matter whatsoever. He has bruken up his book into four great divisions-
Geography, Natural History, Biography, Sciences and Arts. The two volumes of
Geography and the two of Natural History, which are finished, constitute just one half
of these two divisions, and, as far as they go, contain all that an ordinary reader is
solicitous to know, with reference to these large departments of human learning.
“ A cheap serviceable Cyclopædia in a small compass cannot fail to command
pur-
chasers, and the four volumes which form the first instalment of this interesting labour
are worthy of all the commendation we can give them for intelligent care and diligence
in working up the best available materials."
From the “ Quarterly Review," July, 1854.
" Mr. Charles Knight, in a recently published little book, "The Old Printer and
Modern Press,' which abounds in curious facts upon the history of books, states that no
work that occupied more than four or five years in its completion was ever successful in
this country.' “Mr. Knight, in an Improved Edition of the work, which he is issuing
under the title of the English Cyclopædia,' has consequently found it expedient to
break up the former single series into four divisions, for the purpose of bringing each
to a speedier completion."
“THE ENGLISH CYCLOPÆDIA” will be completed in Four Divisions, each having
its own alphabetical arrangement, and each forming four distinct volumes :-
GEOGRAPHY
4 Vols. | SCIENCES AND ARTS
4 Vols.
NATURAL HISTORY . 4 Vols. | BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY. 4 Vols.
The Geographical and Natural History Divisions
ARE NOW IN COURSE OF PUBLICATION, AND WILL BE COMPLETED IN 1855.
Two Volumes of each Division are published, price 10s, each, handsomely and strongly
bound in cloth.
A Number of the Cyclopædia is published every Saturday, price 6d.; one week a
Number of GEOGRAFHY – the next a Number of NATURAL HISTORY—and a Part, price
28., on the last day of every month.

The NATIONAL CYCLOPÆDIA, alphabetically arranged, is a corrected and revised
abridgment of the Penny Cyclopædia. The Proprietor of that work, always ahxious
to meet the requirements of the greatest number of readers, determined on producing

which should preclude all competition. The same talented Editor and Assistants were
induced to contribute their valuable co-operation, and a Cyclopædia has been completed
which, from its accuracy and cheapness, is the most valuable work of the kind ever
produced.

it is sufficient to say, are by Ár. Charles Knight. Withal it is surprisingly cheap."

the supplementary notices which Mr. Knight appended to each play in his beautiful

PARRS LIFE PILLS

MEDICINE THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH
EMPIRE.
Testimony of an eminent Chemist in favour of Parr's Life Pills.
Gentlemen,-At the request of several friends who have introduced Parr's Life Pills
in their families as a medicine, I have submitted them to a strict chemical analysis, in
order to ascertain whether they contained any of those active mercurial and other
mineral preparations now so commonly introduced into many advertised medicines. I
beg to say that I find them worthy of being recommended to the public for their great
efficacy and simplicity, and, as stated by the Proprietors, to be really vegetable pills,
containing, as they do, nothing but what is of vegetable origin.- I am, Gentlemen, your
obedient servant,
John DALE, Analytical Chemist, Manchester.
The Rev. Mr. CLEMENTSON, of Horncastle, is taking Parr's Life Pills, and recom-
mending them to all his friends. He says there is more real benefit in relieving and
assisting the constitution in “Old Parr's" than any other medicine he ever took, and
they have been of essential benefit to numbers of his friends who have tried them.

PARR'S LIFE PILLS are especially efficacious in all the variety of ailments inci-
dental to the fair sex. Ladies, even of the most delicate constitutions, will find them

“ In reply to your letter received this morning, respecting the
Gutta Percha Tubing for Pump Service, I can state with much satisfac-
tion, it answers perfectly. Many Builders, and other persons, have
lately examined it, and there is not the least apparent difference since
the first laying down, now several years; and I am informed that it is
to be adopted generally in the houses that are being erected here."
The Company's Illustrated Circulars, with instructions for joining
Tubes, &c., and for securely attaching Gutta Percha Soles, will be
forwarded (post free) on receipt of three stamps.

Purchasers can have any of the above in case, on roller, or bound according to their prder,
at a moderate charge, on applying to the Publisher.
The Publisher with confidence asserts that the Public have in no other
series of Maps the power here offered of choosing, from so large a number,
a Single Map, at the moderate price of Sixpence. To meet the require-
ments of the age, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge issued
their Maps singly, as well as in Atlases, and a most extensive sale has been
the result, enabling the Proprietors to keep them in the highest state of
accuracy, and, when necessary, to add New Maps. 'London has been engraved
three times since the original plan was published: lately has been issued
an entirely New Map of the Australian Colonies, showing the Gold Regions
of Australia, its divisions in counties, and the distances by sea to the most
important parts of the globe; and the latest discoveries have been correctly
inserted in the Maps which contain the whole or any part of the Arctic
Regions.
