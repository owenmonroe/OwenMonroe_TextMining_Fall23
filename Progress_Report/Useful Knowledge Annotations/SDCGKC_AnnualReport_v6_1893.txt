IReport 
 
 W E have much to rejoice us this year in the various departments of 
 our Society’s work. 
 
 Our Publications. 
 
 The Grace Examinations to commemorate the Empress Dowager 
 reaching the age of 60 were held simultaneously in September. It is a 
 high gratification to us to announce that through special funds, appealed 
 for to meet this special occasion, we succeeded in sending 6,000 of our 
 publications to each of the ten maritime provinces, making 60,000 in 
 all. 720,000 pages were thus distributed gratis, a number far in advance 
 of anything our Society has ever done before. 
 
 Another ambition of ours was the establishment of Branch Depdts 
 in the provinces for the sale of our Publications. We have now Depots 
 in Peking, in Moukden, in Tientsin, Shensi, in Nanking and in Chefoo, 
 with the small supply of $100 worth of literature in each to start with. 
 
 The work which will make this year most memorable however, is 
 the republication of Dr. Faber’s great work on Civilization , a book in 
 5 Chinese Volumes, and treating of all the leading forces of Western 
 Civilization. Thanks to the generosity of the Rev. P. Kranz we have 
 published an edition of two thousand copies, so that we shall be able 
 to present all the great Mandarins of the Empire with a copy each. 
 
 We have also republished the work which the late Dr. Williamson 
 was publishing when he died, viz: What a Nation Needs . This is at the 
 request of the members of the English Baptist Mission, who wish to 
 have it for circulation and who meet the expense of publication. But 
 the stereotyping of several of these works for future use has involved 
 considerable expense. 
 
 The book on the Benefits of Christianity has been sold out at its full 
 cost price, and a new edition has therefore been ordered.

 We have published Mr. George Jamieson’s Article on English Law 
 in China. The outline of the Rise and Progress of the Christian En¬ 
 deavour movement, now numbering millions of followers, published 
 in the Missionary Review , was republished by the United Society of 
 Christian Endeavour for China, and stereotyped by us. Dr. Faber’s 
 Chinese Theories of Human Nature is in press. Miss Harvie, Secretary of 
 the Ladies’ Society in Glasgow, has sent us a box of the beautiful 
 chrome of The Better Land , which will form the finest illustration ever 
 put out for Chinese homes. The Secretaries of the Christian Literature 
 Society in Glasgow have also sent us a fine collection of electros for 
 illustrating our magazines and books. The Progress of Surrounding 
 Nations ; Agricultural Chemistry ; the Value of the Doctrine of Immortality ; 
 Mrs. Foster on Persecutions in Madagascar and Christian Missions in the 
 South Sea, and Daily Readings also by her, have all appeared serially 
 in our periodicals and will be published separately. A Universal 
 History is being translated for our Society. Mackenzie’s Nineteenth 
 Century is also being translated; it will give much needed and most 
 valuable information regarding the latest progress of the nations of the 
 West. 
 
 Our Magazines. 
 
 Of the value of the Review of the limes we have had assurances from 
 Formosa and from Shantung in increased orders for it, and also in reprints 
 of some of our Articles in the Chinese Daily Papers. Of the value of 
 the Missionary Review we also have assurance in the fact that we had to 
 increase the number printed, and also in the frequent republication of 
 some of our Articles in other Chinese religious papers. In it we have 
 kept in mind the wishes of the Ladies’ Branch in Glasgow, who help 
 us so nobly, and have had much of its contents suited to give informa¬ 
 tion in the department they have chosen. But as it does not cover all 
 the objects they have in view, we must suspend its publication for a time 
 in order to publish the Women and Children’s Series ) unless we obtain 
 more funds immediately. 
 
 Dr. Allen’s Return. 
 
 Happily Dr. Allen, who has rendered such valuable service in 
 editing our Magazines, has now returned from his visit to the United 
 States, and will resume the editorial work in connection with which he 
 is so well and widely known.

 China’s Enormous Need of Enlightenment. 
 
 China’s losses and suffering for want of enlightenment are simply 
 appalling. 
 
 For want of political insight she had lost within the last 35 years 
 in N. E. Manchuria a country as large as France; and in the South 
 the tributary states of Ann am, which is now larger than France, and 
 Burma have passed from her control. 
 
 For lack of commercial knowledge she has 80 millions sterling less 
 foreign trade annually than India, she only doubles her trade during 
 the same time as Japan trebles hers, her tea trade rapidly declines for 
 want of adaptation to the changing needs of the market. Her banking 
 commission for transfer of money from one part of the country to 
 another is enormously high, and a million people are daily engaged in 
 the primitive way of weighing their silver and counting their cash. 
 
 For lack of economical means of transport, China fails to obtain the 
 enormous benefits which the West reaps from this source. Mulihall 
 estimates the annual gain to Europe from railways alone at no less than 
 1,200 millions sterling ! As the Chinese Empire is in area and popula¬ 
 tion about the same as Europe, what she misses for want of these is 
 evidently immense. 
 
 For lack of scientific and engineering training the many millions 
 of pounds sterling which each nation in the West gains annually from 
 these, are not within the reach of any educated Chinamen as yet. 
 
 For lack of sound knowledge in practical philanthropy among her 
 very numerous religious teachers—priests and nuns—the great benefit 
 that might be derived from such a large number is not reaped. 
 
 The result of general ignorance on such lines as indicated is the 
 great poverty of the nation as a whole. While many are rich, the great 
 mass is in terrible poverty. The poor, again, have to pay 36 per cent, 
 to pawnshops, and 1U0 per cent, often in order to tide over temporary 
 difficulties. Thousands upon thousands collect in mat sheds at every 
 great city in the winter in order to attend the free soup kitchens there. 
 This practically amounts to slow starvation. Thus China presents such 
 an amount of suffering as far surpasses that of any other country. Yet 
 most of it might be easily removed.

 Some of the most enlightened Chinamen who read our Periodicals 
 regularly, see this and know some of the remedies to he applied. 
 Railways are now sanctioned to be worked in Tientsin : cotton factories 
 and steel works are introduced in Shanghai and Hankow, so that the 
 people of China may partake of their benefits. But the remedies are 
 very slow in their application, and the great bulk of even the mandarins 
 are not only utterly ignorant of their being the greatest sufferers on 
 earth, but complacently congratulate each other that they belong to the 
 only Celestial Empire on earth ! Few among them suspect that our 
 little Society possesses the knowledge by which these gigantic evils — 
 material, moral and spiritual—can be remedied. But we do know the 
 remedies, and by organized efforts we are determined to make them 
 known throughout every corner of this vast Empire. Some day those 
 who read our periodic and systematic treatment of their ills, will, in 
 China as elsewhere, understand our motives and bless us for our work. 
 Meanwhile we have the conviction that by helping the Chinese who are 
 in need of enlightenment, we are helping to lessen the sum total of 
 suffering from the face of the earth, we are opening the way for 
 development on all sides in every province, and greatly strengthening 
 the hands of all the best in the land. The grand record of history 
 which the Chinese possess in the past is assurance of a glorious future 
 for them. It is our privilege to be of service to them in this their hour 
 of great need, and to give them the advice of true friends. 
 
 Finance. 
 
 We very gratefully record the receipt of £135 from Mr. Hart, the 
 Treasurer of the late Booh and Trad Society , and the generous aid 
 received from the Christian Literature Society in Glasgow, both from the 
 Gentlemen’s and from the Ladies’ Branches as well as the continued 
 support of the American Trad, Society . There is no question they are 
 taking a part in one of the most important factors existing in China 
 for its enlightenment and benefit. The efforts of the friends at home 
 to help in the work have been a great encouragement to us, and the 
 magnificent gift of Pastor Kranz of $1,200 for the distribution of Dr. 
 Faber’s Civilization and specimen chapters at the examination centres, 
 specially deserves our hearty thanks. 
 
 The distribution of our literature in one of the first Examination 
 centres is also a matter of special interest. The Misses Harvie by taking

 one centre—namely Nanking—between them, which costs only £20 
 annually, are reaching the leaders of thought in ten counties. We 
 sincerely hope others will follow up other centres. 
 
 This year, 1893, there have been the Grace Examinations. Next 
 year will be held the regular Triennial Examinations at each of the 
 provincial capitals. Simultaneously about ten thousand candidates will 
 compete for their equivalent of our M. A. degree in each of the 20 
 provincial capitals. If we had others to follow the example of these 
 ladies in each of the great centres of thought, and if we had funds to 
 publish important manuscripts now in hand, on how to improve the 
 material and intellectual as well as the moral and spiritual condition 
 of the Chinese, there is no doubt that the systematic and periodic 
 presentation of the highest truths in this way would accomplish wonders 
 for China, and we now make the appeal that such may be the case. 
 
 Death. 
 
 We cannot close the Report without referring to the great loss we 
 have sustained in the sudden death of Mr. John Macgregor. Our 
 Executive Committee directed that a special resolution of deep regret 
 and profound sympathy with the bereaved be drawn up. It reads 
 thus :— 
 
 That the Executive Committee of the Society for the Diffusion of 
 Christian and General Knowledge among the Chinese desires to record 
 its sense of deep loss sustained by it in the death of the late John 
 Macgregor, who had acted as Vice-President of our Society and who 
 had rendered most valuable services as an active Director of it from its 
 establishment till the time of his lamented death, and that the Com¬ 
 mittee tenders its sincerest sympathy with his family in the great loss 
 they have sustained. 
 
 We earnestly hope that his noble example will stimulate others 
 to devote themselves unsparingly, as he did, for the public good.

 The Sixth Annual Meeting of the members and friends of this 
 Society was held on Thursday afternoon in the Municipal Council 
 Board Boom. Mr. George Jamieson, H.B.M.’s Consul, presided, and 
 there was a numerous attendance, i ncluding several ladies. 
 
 The Chairman, having remarked that he presumed the meeting 
 would take the minutes of the last meeting and the annual report 
 as read, said—As you know, the object of our Society is to bring 
 to the Chinese, and more especially to the ruling classes, some 
 knowledge of Western civilisation, science and learning. We are 
 endeavouring to reach them, as far as possible, either at the public 
 examinations for the most part, or at the large centres of the 
 interior, the idea being to reach as far as possible the better class of 
 Chinese and stimulate a mental appetite amongst them and create a 
 desire for further information. So far as our limited funds permit, we 
 have been doing some work of that sort during the year, which is 
 detailed in the report drawn up by Mr. Kichard. One of the principal 
 organs the Society uses is the magazine known as the Review of the 
 Times , which Mr. Richard has been editing during the year, and which 
 now, since Dr. Allen’s return, will fall back into his (Dr. Allen’s) hands. 
 There the Editor endeavours to gather together whatever there may 
 be of interest happening in the world at large and put it in as attractive 
 a form as possible among the Chinese. That is, I believe, entirely for 
 sale, but in other respect the Society prepares small manuals on matters 
 of varied interest, and these, as far as we can, are distributed gratis 
 among the students and other reading people in the interior. The funds 
 that we have at our disposal are not, so far, very extensive. They are 
 for the most part contributed from Scotland, which has sent us, as you 
 will see, during the year rather more than XdOO, and we added to that a 
 very modest contribution made up in China, which, I am sorry to say, 
 is not so large as it might be, but, I hope, as interest in the Society 
 increases, and it becomes better known, these subscription in time will 
 amount to very much more. With these few words I shall move the 
 adoption of the report (Applause.) 
 
 The Rev. Dr. Allen—I have very great pleasure in seconding this 
 motion. I have just returned from the United States after an absence 
 of twelve months or more, and I am very glad to find that the work has 
 been going on so well and so much has been done. It strikes me there

 is; perhaps, a crisis coming in the history of our work here. Myself and 
 others have been identified with it for many years and we see very 
 great progress. One of the chief and most encouraging facts that I 
 notice is the naturalisation, so to speak, of ideas. We have been here 
 a long time in various capacities, as merchants and missionaries. The 
 Chinese have been very slow, apparently, to accept our teaching, whether 
 from the commercial or the missionary standpoint. We see them now, 
 however beginning to naturalise our ideas, and, from buying our articles, 
 or purchasing things made abroad, they are beginning to learn to do 
 these things themselves, and as they are beginning to study these things 
 and produce them themselves, we find there is a disposition to naturalise 
 these foreign ideas. So with regard to our religious work, I think there 
 is a spontaneous and natural movement to take these ideas and adopt 
 them. The Chinese are beginning now to accept our teaching, adopt 
 our ideas and adapt them to their use, and I think it can be very easily 
 proved from the line of progress already developed, that as their concep¬ 
 tions and their convictions reach the point, they will accept and do 
 accept nearly everything they can handle. We are contributing largely 
 in this Society to that very object and purpose, reaching their convic¬ 
 tions and then laying before them the modus operandi and encouraging 
 them to adopt it, and there is a very large practical benefit to accrue to 
 them and to us, and the world in general. The healthful development 
 of this country would add greatly to the blessings and benefits of the 
 world, and, therefore, while we are apparently doing very little, yet we 
 are working, so to speak, at the foundations of the great movement and 
 enterprise which is to bless not only China but all the world. (Hear, 
 hear.) I have, therefore, great pleasure in seconding the adoption of the 
 report. (Applause.) 
 
 The Rev. Timothy Richard—In addition to what you find in the 
 report I should like to show that our work is being appreciated. I 
 would mention two facts come to my notice since writing the Report. 
 A writer—one of the Secretaries in the Arsenal here—got hold of one 
 of our pamphlets and was so pleased that he wrote to one of the Chinese 
 daily papers speaking in high terms of the work that was being done, 
 and then sent for more of our publications. The other very interesting 
 item is in connection with the last depdt, we have opened, far away in 
 the north-west—Sinanfu, the capital of the province of Shensi. There 
 the oppo ition was so great only a short time ago that the missionary

 who has charge of our depot, and who is very anxious to carry out the 
 plans of our Society, was obliged to fly for his life. That was only two 
 months ago. But he lately went back to the capital, and a mandarin 
 now offers a house to him free of charge if he will stay there and con¬ 
 tinue his work, saying : “ If you will remain here it will be a god-send 
 to our place.” (Applause.) 
 
 The resolution for the adoption of the report was then put to the 
 meeting and carried unanimously. 
 
 The Bev. W. Muirhead—The second resolution has just been put 
 into my hands. It is : — 
 
 That as this Society is the only general institution in China for systemati¬ 
 cally putting before the influential Chinese all the leading factors in Western 
 civilisation, and as the connection between enlightenment and development in 
 all branches of life is obvious, we most heartily recommend this Society to all 
 who are interested in the development of the vast resources of this great 
 Empire. 
 
 In speaking to this resolution I should be glad to lay before those 
 who are now present a few considerations. One is that this Society is 
 literary in its character and in its objects, and so adapted to the 
 millions of Chinese. We are in the midst of a country by no means 
 ignorant nor altogether uncivilised, but the contrary. The report which 
 we have in our hands speaks of millions in connection with this country 
 who have attained a certain amount of enlightenment that has been 
 handed down to them from very remote ages. They are to be found 
 everywhere; amidst all classes of Society and particularly in connec¬ 
 tion with the various examinations that take place from time to time. 
 Literature is the one great boast of China, and as this is the special aspect 
 of this Society it is happily adapted to the conditions in which China 
 is placed, and it is a great thing indeed to have such a means of 
 extending knowledge and enlightenment, of which, it may be, we are 
 possessed. Where is there a country, apart from those which bear the 
 name of Christendom, to be compared with China in this point of view? 
 It is not only that the Chinese think so highly of their own literary 
 attainments, but ’they have reason for doing so. And in this point of 
 view we consider the character and objects, the aims and the ends of 
 this Society, most suited to the actual circumstances in which China is 
 placed. Another consideration is this, that the knowledge which it is 
 the purpose of this Society to communicate is just the very knowledge 
 


## p. (#15) #################################################

17 
 
 which the Chinese stand in need of. The name on the report is that 
 the Society has it in view to communicate Christian and general 
 knowledge. No better words could be used to express the actual neces¬ 
 sity of the millions of this country, and we consider that the Society 
 on whose acount we have met this afternoon is admirably suited for this 
 all-important purpose. We desire to raise the Chinese to a much higher 
 sphere of development than they have hitherto reached. It is not 
 possible for the Chinese themselves to do it. They have had ages, I 
 might almost say untold ages, for self-development and for attaining a 
 far higher sort of knowledge and civilisation than they have hitherto 
 done; but they most grievously failed, and it is such knowledge, 
 Christian and general, that this Society purposes to communicate which 
 the Chinese stand in need of. Here, then, this Society has been formed 
 for the purpose in question, and we may well rejoice in the formation 
 of the Society in order to extend far and wide the blessings—I shall 
 venture to use the word—-which it is in our power to impart. Another 
 consideration of this kind is that to a very large extent we command 
 the avenue by which the knowledge in question may be imparted. Time 
 was when China was closed all throughout, and the ordinary remark 
 was: “ O Eock, when wilt thou open ? ” We know it is otherwise now, 
 and we have to congratulate ourselves especially in the appointment 
 of our present Hon. Secretary, for the devotedness and zeal with which 
 the management is conducted, and that he has made such arrangements 
 as shall fully comply with the requirements of the case. (Applause.) 
 From north to south and from east to west of China, our honoured 
 friend is in command of the means whereby the knowledge of which we 
 may be possessed may be communicated far and wide. (Applause.) He is 
 not only devoted to this kind of thing and doing it with an intensity of 
 will and purpose, but he has so arranged matters that in every part of 
 the Empire our friend is possessed of an influence for which we are duly 
 thankful. I do not know any one who would carry out the ends and 
 objects of the Society with such efficiency and such a practical good 
 nature as our esteemed friend is able to do. (Hear, hear.) If, then, this 
 Society is literary in its aim and objects, and so adapted to the condi¬ 
 tion of China; if this Society is communicating knowledge and en¬ 
 lightenment such as the Chinese most especially stand in need of, then 
 this Society is adapted to the necessities of the case, and seeing that 
 such arrangements have been made as enable us to command an 
 extensive avenue to all the possibilities of the case, to the length and 
 


## p. (#16) #################################################

18 
 
 breadth of the land, we may rejoice in the establishment of this associa¬ 
 tion to extend the object that we have in view. I think, therefore, that 
 this Society has a claim upon the sympathy and help of this foreign 
 community, and I hope that the appeal which is now being made, and 
 which will be issued in a more extensive form, will meet with a very 
 large response, and that the Society will be enabled to do a far greater 
 amount of work than it has hitherto done, and which it is the great aim 
 of the officers to carry into effect. (Applause.) 
 
 The Rev. Dr. Edkins said he had very great pleasure in seconding 
 the resolution. He agreed with Dr. Allen that we had arrived at a 
 critical time in the history of China, and in the history of missionary 
 efforts in China and the endeavour to spread useful knowledge among 
 the Chinese people. He had been talking with Dr. Faber, just fresh 
 from the Parliament of Religions at Chicago, and he had been reading 
 some of the reports of the discussions. The feeling seemed to have 
 been universal in Chicago, amongst all those present at the meetings, 
 that it was a most remarkable thing even to have got them together. 
 Not only in America but elsewhere were they coming into friendly 
 contact with the different religions—and that included philosophy 
 too—and social customs, and it seemed to him the present must be 
 regarded as a time of crisis. It was most unexpected that an eminent 
 Chinese should go to the Parliament of Religions and speak, just as 
 the Japanese went. Japan at present was in a state of excitement, 
 and it was a most extraordinary thing that every year seemed to 
 make a change in the feeling of Japan, and it was very much upon 
 the subject of religion and what they should do with European 
 systems of thought. In China they must be prepared to meet the 
 occasion when it arose. He believed the country was opening up and 
 that ignorance and superstition would disappear, because they had 
 Divine light and power to help them. (Applause.) 
 
 The Rev. Timothy Richard drew attention to a number of books 
 on the table as illustrative of the publications circulated by the 
 Society. Two years ago in their report they said their aim was to 
 reach all the mandarins and leading scholars of the Empire, and Mr. 
 Purdon, who presided at the meeting, said if they could only do a 
 tithe of that they would be doing a very great work. He (the speaker) 
 had the pleasure to announce that through the generosity of Pastor 
 Kranz they had been able to present all the great mandarins of the

 Empire with a copy of Dr. Faber’s splendid work on Civilisation. 
 Then they wanted to reach the scholars of the land at all the capitals 
 of the provinces. That morning he received the following letter, by 
 which they hoped now to reach the capitals of five provinces. The 
 letter was:— 
 
 Shanghai, 29th November, 1893. 
 
 Rev. Timothy Richard, 
 
 Secretary of the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General 
 Knowledge among the Chinese. 
 
 Dear Sir, —Your suggestion of this day commends itself to me, and I 
 shall with pleasure contribute Tls. 500—for the purpose of offering prizes of 
 Tls. 100 each at Soochow, Peking, Canton, Foochow, and Hangchow during 
 the year 1894. 
 
 These prizes are to be competed for by the students who periodically 
 gather for examination at those cities, and the essays are to be judged and the 
 awards given by your Society. 
 
 In view of the fact that nine-tenths of the foreign work done in the interior 
 has for its aim the spiritual good of China, I prefer that my small gift should 
 be directed to the material and intellectual welfare of the Chinese. 
 
 1 therefore throw out as suggestions the following as themes from which 
 the persons competing may choose :— 
 
 1. —The advantages to be derived by China from adopting the railway 
 system, the coinage of silver money, and an Imperial postal system, as Japan 
 has recently done. 
 
 2. —The advantage to accrue if China would introduce machinery for the 
 preparation of tea, and for the reeling of silk, so as the better to compete with 
 foreign countries. 
 
 3. —The benefit derived during the past thirty years by the excellent 
 administration of the Imperial Maritime Customs. 
 
 4. —Show whether China is really in earnest in wishing the opium trade 
 stopped, and prove that it is possible to suppress the immense culture of the 
 poppy in China if the Government of India consents to cease producing the 
 drug. 
 
 5. —Show how may better and more friendly relations be established 
 between China and foreign countries. 
 
 The names of the successful candidates should be made known, and 
 translations of the essays printed if possible. I intend to give Tls. 100 towards 
 the expenses incurred in regard to this competition. 
 
 Yours sincerely, 
 
 Thomas Hanbury. 
 
 (Applause.) 
 
 Mr. O. Thorne proposed— 
 
 That the following names be added to the list of Directors, viz: Messrs. 
 P. G. von Mollendorff, R. Eiswaldt, Acting German Consul-General; W. D. 
 Hunter, United States Vice-Consul-General in charge; James Scott, British 
 Vice-Consul; and the Revs. F. L. H. Pott and J. R. Hykes.

 It was a painful fact they lost many of their directors year by 
 year; some went home to return no more, and others, unfortunately, 
 were removed by death. In the report, allusion had been made to 
 the death of one of their most respected members, Mr. John Macgregor, 
 but as it had been put in the form of a resolution in the report it was 
 needless for him to say more upon the subject. 
 
 The Rev. T. Richard seconded and the resolution was carried 
 unanimously. 
 
 Mr. von Mollendorff proposed— 
 
 That the Executive Committee and Officers for next year be the same as 
 this year, with the exception of those who have gone away, and that power be 
 given them to add to their number. 
 
 The Rev. F. L. H. Pott, in seconding the resolution, said the 
 Society emphasised the fact that all truth was divine, and also the 
 principle that they were working for the good of man in this world, 
 not only for his good in the world to come. 
 
 The resolution was adopted nem. con. 
 
 The Chairman said the ordinary business of the meeting had 
 been transacted, but they ought not to separate without a vote of 
 thanks to Mr. Hanbury and Pastor Kranz. (Hear, hear.) They ought 
 also to give a vote of thanks to the ladies for attending in such 
 numbers. (Hear, hear.) 
 
 The votes were carried by acclamation and the proceedings 
 terminated.
