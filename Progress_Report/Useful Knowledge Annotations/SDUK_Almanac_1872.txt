LAMPLOUGH'S
PYRETIC SALINE
Is found pre-eminently beneficial in preventing and curing SMALL POX, by Puri-
fying, Invigorating, and Vitalizing the Blood. Any person who has already this
complaint should take it, and be kept in a cool and darkened room to prevent its
leaving any trace on the features.
SICKNESS, HEADACHE, and NAUSEA are in most cases immediately relieved
by taking a teaspoonful in a tumbler of cold water. This can be repeated once or
twice in two hours, if needful.
SEA VOYAGES :-It is a very valuable accompaniment, and should on no account
be omitted. It instantly allays the sea or bilious sickness.
For BILIOUS CONSTITUTIONS, giving rise to vitiated secretions, Indigestion, and
Eruptions on the Skin, a teaspoonful should be taken daily, with the dinner, in a
tumbler of water, and the same quantity on going to bed.
“RAWUL PUNDEE, PUNJAB, INDIA, 28th March, 1871.
"On the recommendation of several officers, who had some of your Saline, in the West Indies,
all of whom speak in the highest terms of your Pyretic Saline, we were induced to try it for the
first time in this Province. This result was not due to any novelty in introducing a new
medicine, but solely from the ascertained merits of your preparation after use in the fever-stricken
districts by which we are surrounded, and we firmly believe that the use of your Pyretic Saline
will do more to PREVENT fever than all the Quinine ever imported can cure. We write thus
strongly, because both from personal experience and observation, we believe we have at
length found a remedy against the ever-present fevers of these parts, which costs the British
nation hundreds of valuable lives in Peshawur alone.
We are now willing to enter into special terms for large and continued supplies, &c.”

EXPLANATORY NOTICES.
EXPLANATORY NOTICES.
Thermometrical Register.
THE Thermometrical Register, showing the highest and lowest temperature of the
corresponding month of the preceding year, has been resumed in the British Almanac
this year at the request of numerous correspondents. These registers are copied from
those made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. They show the highest and lowest
ranges within each twenty-four hours, from self-registering thermometers. Each
month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most ready and
advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register of the
last three months of 1870 follows the nine months of 1871, which are all that can be
given up to the day of publication.
Equation of Time.
In this Almanac the calculations are all made for mean time (given by the clock),
instead of apparent time (given by the sun-dial), which latter had been used up to the
year 1833. It must be obvious that, for all practical purposes, mean time is the most
useful; and to obtain it from apparent time, the columns in the Almanac headed
“ Equation of Time" should be used. The column “Equation of Time" ought, for
example, to be consulted when persons are desirous of setting their clock by a sun-dial.
When clock after sun is written above the number of minutes and seconds opposite to the
day, then the clock ought to be set so much slower than the sun-dial, and the contrary.
Moonlight.
The Moon's age is set down in days and the nearest tenths of days from the time of
change. Thus it is New Moon on the 8th of April at Oh. 32m. morning, and there-
fore at noon of that day she is 11h. 28m. old, which is set down as five-tenths. The
fraction of the day of course continues the same throughout the lunation. See also
the table showing the duration of moonlight on page 10.
VARIATION OF THE COMPAss, or the declination of the magnetic or mariner's needle
from the meridian or true north and south line at the undermentioned places in the
United Kingdom, estimated for the year 1872.
N.B.—The variation is westerly, that is, the magnetic pole is west of the true north
pole, and is found to be decreasing in the United Kingdom about 9' annually.

THE table, pages 3-4, has been constructed to show the variations of time through the
United Kingdom-namely, between the latitude of 58° and 50° 10' N. The times of
sun-rising and sun-setting are computed for the instant that the sun's centre is even
with the horizon of the sea. The number of minutes found in this table under the
month-day, and in the required latitude, are to be applied to the time of sun-rising
and setting found on that day in the Almanac; the result will be the time of his
rising and setting at the place required.--Ex. At what time will the sun fise and
set on May 21 at Edinburgh? The times of sunrise and sunset on that day in the
Almanac are 4h. lm. A.m., and 7h. 52m. P.M. In the table, in parallel of 56°, in which
(p. 3) Edinburgh is found, and under May 21, are 23 minutes; which, subtracted from
4h. Im., leaves 3h. 38m. for time of sunrise; and, added to 7h. 52m., gives 8h. 15m.
for time of sun-setting. But at those places where instead of mean time at place* rail-
way time is now used, which in Great Britain is Greenwich mean time, and in Ireland
Dublin mean time, to the times of sun-rising and sun-setting, as deduced by the aux-
iliary table, the longitude in time must be applied thus:-For places in Great Britain
whose longitude is west of Greenwich, to the time of sunrise or sunset add the longi-
tude in time, and to places whose longitude is east of Greenwich, subtract the longitude
in time, the result will be the railway or Greenwich time that the sun rises or sets.
N.B.-Longitude in arc, indicated by the signs /" (degrees, minutes, and seconds)
is converted into longitude in time by reckoning 360° — 24 h., 15º =lh., and 1°= 4m.
Example:-On June 21st at Penzance, in latitude 50° 7' N. and longitude 5° 31' W.,
what will be the railway time that the sun rises and sets ?
* See above, Explanatory Notices, Equation of Time.

To find the time of High Water at the above Places, it will be necessary to add or
subtract the numbers in the above Table, according to the directions stated, to or
from the time of High Water at London, as given in the Calendar for the day required
For example:-On the 14th of January, the morning High Water at London Bridge
is 4h. 30m.; the High Water at Dover Pier is 3h. 10m. earlier; subtract, according
to the direction, 3h. 10m. from 4h. 30m., and the time of High Water at Dover
Pier on that day will be found to be at lh. 20m. in the morning.

The Angles are reckoned towards the right hand round the circumference of the
Moon's image as seen in an inverting telescope.
For direct image, take the opposite points; that is, in numbers, add or subtract 180°.
The “Sidereal Times” are given for the use of those having observatories and astronomical
Sidereal clocks. General readers will take the times of "disappearance" and "reappearance"
from the columns headed "Mean Time," and they will bear in mind that they are always counted
from noon. When the time stated is less than 12h. it therefore denotes the time in the afternoon:
when it exceeds the 12h., by rejecting the 12h. the remainder will indicate the time on the follow-
ing morning; and, in each case, according to Greenwich mean time, which is now uniformly
exhibited by railway and public clocks in the United Kingdom.

QUARTER SESSIONS (1872)
IN THE SEVERAL COUNTIES OF ENGLAND AND WALES.
By the Act 1 Will. IV. c. 70, it is enacted that in the year 1831, and afterwards,
the Justices of the Peace in every county, riding, or division, for which Quarter Sessions
of the Peace by law ought to be held, shall hold their general Quarter Sessions of the
Peace in the first whole week after the Ilth October, in the first week after the 28th
of December, in the first week after the 31st of March, and in the first week after the
24th of June.” The following list has been computed according to this rule.
The Act 4 and 5 Will. IV. cap. 47, allows a discretionary power to the Justices of
Peace as to the time of holding the Spring Quarter Sessions, and empowers them to
alter the day for holding the Sessions, so as not to be earlier than the 7th of March,
nor later than the 22nd of April. The dates given below are, therefore, only pro-

The Months in the above Table are calculated at only Twelve Months to the Year. If the
Yearly Wages be Guineas instead of Pounds, for each Guinea add one Penny to each Month, or
one Farthing to each Week. Thus, Six Pounds per year are Ten Shillings per Month; but, if the
Wages be six Guineas, add one Penny for each Guinea, that is, Sixpence, and it will then be Ten
Shillings and Sixpence per Month. In like manner, by adding Six Farthings to each Week, the
Wages will be Two Shillings and Fivepence per Week.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON SUBJECTS OF MATHEMATICS

ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF STATISTICS.
STATISTICS, generally considered, is a term of very comprehensive
import, and is to be understood as having reference to an im-
portant collection of facts properly arranged and systematized in
the form of numerical tables, for the purpose of conveying such
information or data as may best assist in the investigation and
discussion of particular subjects of inquiry. The general princi-
ples applicable to these investigations are, for the most part,
intimately allied with the mathematical theory of probabilities,
and constitute the true science of statistics. It will, moreover, be
found, on examination, that the same identical principles lie at
the foundation of all the physical and inductive sciences so far as
they originally and necessarily depend upon experiment and
observation.
The word statistics, derived from the Latin, status, signifies a
state, condition, or standing. The subject of statistics has, how-
ever, by some writers, been unnecessarily restricted to that
department of political science which is concerned in collecting
and arranging facts illustrative of the condition and resources of
a nation. It is chiefly to the advancement and growing import-
ance of political economy that we are indebted for the cultivation
of this particular branch of statistics. The fundamental doctrines
of that science, which are directly concerned about the prosperity
and happiness of mankind, were not reduced to any method or
system until the middle of the last century; and since that time
political economy has been more assiduously cultivated as an
inductive science. The truth of preconceived theories has been
practically tested by the observations and analysis of facts; and
new principles have been gradually discovered and established
by the same means.
It therefore becomes the duty of a govern-
ment to apply all the means in its power in aid of statistics, not
only for general information and the administration of the affairs
of state, but also for the advancement of political science.

On the Philosophy of Statistics.
In the report of the third meeting of the British Association
it is stated that, in addition to the five then existing sections,
another, originating with some distinguished philosophers, had
come into operation, the object of which was to promote statis-
tical inquiries. The president, Professor Sedgwick, in justifica-
tion of the addition of this sixth section, furthermore stated, that
statistical inquiries may be made compatible with the objects of
the British Association, “ so far as they have to do with matters
of fact, with mere abstractions, and with numerical results. Con-
sidered in that light they give what may be called the raw
material to political economy and political philosophy; and by
their help the lasting foundations of those sciences may be per-
haps ultimately laid.” In the following year this new section
was referred to as the prelude to the establishment of a flourish-
ing society (the Statistical Society), which acknowledges itself
the offspring of the Association, and which promises, by a pro-
cedure similar to that introduced by the Association, to advance
materially the greatly neglected subject of British statistics.
From the original prospectus of the Statistical Society, printed
at the end of the report of the third meeting of the British
Association, we extract the following :
6 THE STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON has been established
(15 March, 1834) for the purposes of procuring, arranging, and
publishing Facts calculated to illustrate the condition and
prospects of society.'
“The Statistical Society will consider it to be the first and
most essential rule of its conduct to exclude carefully all opinions
from its transactions and publications,—to confine its attention
rigorously to facts,-and, as far as it may be found possible, to
facts which can be stated numerically and arranged in tables.
“The first operation of the Society will probably be to sub-
divide and organise its General Council in such a manner as may
enable that Council to deal conveniently with all the subdivisions
of the subject-matter before it. Those subdivisions will neces-
sarily be numerous.
“The whole subject was considered by the statistical section
of the British Association at Cambridge, as admitting a division
into four great classes :-
“ 1. Economical Statistics.
“ 2. Political Statistics.
“3. Medical Statistics.
“ 4. Moral and Intellectual Statistics.
“ Economical Statistics comprehend, 1st, the statistics of the
natural productions and the agriculture of nations ; 2ndly, of
manufactures ; 3rdly, of conimerce and currency ; 4thly, of the
distribution of wealth, or all facts relating to rent, wages,
profits, &c.
“ Political Statistics furnish three subdivisions : 1st, the facts
relating to the elements of political institutions, the number of

7
electors, jurors, &c. ; 2ndly, legal statistics ; 3rdly, the statistics
of finance and of national expenditure, and of civil and military
establishments.
“ Medical Statistics, strictly so called, will require at least two
subdivisions, and the great subject of population, although it
might be classed elsewhere, yet touches medical statistics on so
many points, that it would be placed most conveniently, perhaps,
in this division, and would constitute a third subdivision.
“Moral and Intellectual Statistics comprehend, 1st, the statistics
of literature ; 2ndly, of education ; 3rdly, of religious instruc-
tion and ecclesiastical institutions ; 4thly, of crime. Although
fourteen subdivisions have now been enumerated, it is probable
that more will be required.”
According to this restricted and stringent programme, to
reason upon the facts presented, or to draw conclusions from
them, is not within the province of statistics ; but is the business
of the statesman and of the political economist. And, in order
still further to exemplify the precise character and limits of
statistics, the emblem chosen for the Statistical Society consisted
of a wheat-sheaf, with the motto “aliis exterendum.” The
statistical drudge was absolutely required to stifle his opinions ;
and to content himself with binding up his sheaves of wheat for
others to thrash out !
It is satisfactory to know that, in the interests of science, these
absurd restrictions have been necessarily disregarded in the
numerous valuable papers that have appeared in the series of
volumes of the Journal since issued by the Society. The statist
usually sets out his results in numerical tables, because facts,
especially when they exist in large numbers, are most compactly
and clearly conveyed in tabular statements ; and because he is
not satisfied with giving deductions which may admit of ques-
tion, but supplies the materials which every one may himself
examine and compare.
It is not true that statistics consist
merely of columns of figures ; it is required that all conclusions
shall be fairly drawn from well-attested data, and shall be
capable of mathematical demonstration. One of the principal
objects of the statist is to ascertain the actual condition of his
country and the causes of that condition, with a view to discover
also the methods of improving it. The actual condition of the
country is by no means obvious to the superficial observer, and
the causes of the various phenomena which it exhibits lie very
deep, and can only be elicited with the aid of extensive investi-
gations conducted with skill and judgment as well as with
mathematical exactitude. The statistics of education, of crime,
of pauperism, of labour, of health, of trade, of agriculture, of
manufactures, and of every one of the details which enter into
the survey of our national condition and prospects are closely
connected one with another. At the same time, not only do they
admit of being studied separately, but more true progress will be
made by such a method of study. In these inquiries the statist
should know what information is wanted, and how he will look
;

for it, before he commences his examination of a mass of figures ;
his mind should be unbiassed by any preconceived opinions and
ready to receive the suggestions which the study is sure to pro-
duce. He should be ready at once to abandon any hypothesis as
soon as he finds it to be untenable, and to subject his materials
to new tests as occasion arises. It will also be of great advantage
that other minds should be brought into contact with his own,
and that he should profit by the suggestions which their inde-
pendent inquiries cannot fail to elicit. Statistics of population
should have his special attention, as it is closely connected with
so many other subjects.
Population is the statistical element of greatest importance : it
relates, above all, to the people, and a just appreciation of their
welfare and their requirements. It would be vain to attempt to
form social statistics of value without having as a basis the
results of a periodical census executed with every necessary pre-
caution, and with all the accuracy which is so indispensable.
Other data have no real value, except so far as they relate to the
numbers of the population. The classification according to age
supplies the means of establishing useful tables of population, of
forming correct views on mortality, on the efficient resources at
the disposal of the State in case of necessity, and of fixing the
ratio between the useful portion which actively contributes to
the general well-being and the weaker portion which yet requires
assistance and support to become in its turn useful. The classi-
fication by professions, trade, and occupation, indicates the means
by which the population provides for its subsistence, and allows
the legislator more particularly to concentrate his attention on
the separate details of the complicated machine confided to his
The classifications by civil condition, by education, by
origin, &c., furnish the administration with no less valuable in-
formation to assure internal good order, and to facilitate the
execution of the laws. In fact, all questions which are con-
nected with population deserve the greatest possible attention on
the part of the Government.
Medical statistics are closely connected with the subject of
population, and present the greatest difficulties to scientific
investigation. The progress of medical science is necessarily slow
and uncertain, for this reason, that the phenomena observed owe
their origin to causes that are innumerable, and that, conse-
quently, they seldom admit of being compared one with another.
If there were a rigorous identity in all constitutions, then one
disease followed by a cure, and well observed, would be suffi-
cient to obtain a similar success every time that the same disease
was reproduced in other individuals. But this perfect identity
cannot reasonably be supposed to exist ; and if it were abso-
lutely requisite to foresee all the cases which could be presented,
so as to collect sufficient observations to verify all possible com-
binations, we should despair of ever arriving at anything satis-
factory, Looking, however, at the broader lines of distinction,
there does not really exist a very formidable number of essen-
care.

tially different cases, although the causes which influence one
disease are in general both numerous and susceptible of varia-
tion. It is therefore only necessary to distinguish the more pro-
minent causes which show a very decided individual influence,
and to ascertain from a sufficient number of observations the
degree of energy which belongs to each. In medical statistics
relating to public health, in consequence of larger numbers, the
facts are, in the aggregate, less complicated, and therefore more
easily susceptible of a statistical analysis.
In the prosecution of medical science there are two distinct
departments which may be conveniently separated. The successful
cure of the patient depends on a compound event, viz. :-1, That
the doctor shall discover the nature of the disease ; 2, That he
shall know the mode of treatment to be adopted. The former of
these inquiries should have the precedence; diagnostics should
always precede therapeutics. Investigation should first be
directed to questions of diagnostics, or the distinguishing of
symptoms. Such symptoms being given, what is the probability
that the patient is affected by one malady rather than another?
What is the probability of its duration, of its intermittence, and
of its passing into a chronic state when it is abandoned to the
operation of nature only? These questions, amongst others of
equal importance, being once resolved, would constitute the surest
basis for the study of the influence of medicine. In all these, as
in other inquiries, the student should inform himself by observation,
collect and analyse well-recorded facts, and render them as com-
parable as possible before seeking to discuss them with a view of
deducing their relations, and methodically proceeding to the
appreciation of causes.
The sciences of observation have for their object the study of
the natural bodies by which we are surrounded and of the laws
connected with them. They all proceed in a similar manner, and
the same rules are generally applicable to them. In all of them
it is equally found necessary to commence by collecting well-
observed facts and classifying them systematically, so as to convey
the required information. It is in weighing and appreciating the
value and relative importance of the facts that science properly
begins. The causes which might have produced them are sought,
their mode of action and their degree of energy studied, and an
attempt is made to proceed from a knowledge of the past to a
knowledge of what is to come. All sciences of observation at
their commencement have undergone the same phases; they were
formerly arts, for they were in the first stages necessarily limited
to grouping, in a more or less successful manner, collections of
observations and facts belonging to a particular order of things ;
and it is by the comparison and discussion of these facts that they
afterwards became elevated to the rank of integral departments
of science. If the subject of statistics presents itself in a similar
manner and passes through the same phases, its future is not
doubtful to those who can comprehend the sciences of observation
in a philosophical point of view.

On the Philosophy of Statistics.
It should be remembered as a matter of general utility in the
preparation and discussion of statistical tables, that material
verifications, by means of differences, should extend to the
columns of figures, as to the continuity of their progression.
This object is singularly facilitated by the use of diagrams. A
simple line enables us to appreciate at a glance a succession of
numbers which the most subtle mind would find it difficult to
retain and compare. The facility we thus have of at once per-
ceiving a series of results, and of recognizing the peculiarities of
their progression is such that we may at the same time follow
another set of results, and judge by the common inflexion of the
lines the ratios existing between the elements under comparison,
and the common causes which may modify them simultaneously
Graphical representations cannot be too highly recommended
when it is required to check series of numbers influenced by
common causes, and to take a general view of the modes of action
of such causes.
It has already been stated, at the commencement of this paper,
that the scientific principles of statistics, properly considered,
enter somewhat extensively into the calculus of probabilities.
An account of this important connexion, exhibiting some of the
higher mathematical applications, will perhaps comprise the most
interesting and most scientific part of the subject now under con-
sideration. Before entering upon this account it may be found
useful to premise a short statement of the fundamental principles
of the mathematical theory.
PROBABILITY is a numerical fraction expressing the value of
the degree of presumption in favour of the occurrence of a parti-
cular event, when the causes or conditions which influence the
result are partly known and partly indeterminate. The word
chance has a similar signification, and is more commonly used
when the operating causes are so far unknown that there is
almost a total absence of information, or data, to guide the mind
to any settled conclusion, and when the individual result is not
expected to approximate to any general average. In common
phraseology the word chance means that we do not perceive any
reason why the event should happen one way rather than
another.
Every event is the result of some antecedent cause or combi-
tion of causes. A full knowledge of all the attending conditions
and circumstances would be sufficient to determine the event.
When, however, the several influences which combine in the pro-
duction or non-production of an event are only partly known and
partly indeterminate, the event is in such case indeterminate or
contingent; it may or may not happen, so far as our limited
knowledge extends, and the probability of its happening, or the
presumption in favour of its occurrence, is to be ascertained by
an accurate examination of the particular result under every
possible combination of the indeterminate conditions.
In the theory of probabilities it must always be understood
that the causes of events are considered only in reference to the

11
number of chances they afford for the occurrence of those events
which they may possibly, but do not necessarily, produce.
The simplest case of probability is that in which the event can
happen in a certain number of ways, and may fail in another
given number of ways, and in which the circumstances are such,
that amongst these several ways all are equally likely to happen.
The probability of the occurrence of the event is in such case
accurately measured by the fraction of which the numerator is
the number of possible ways in which the event can happen, and
the denominator the total number of ways. That is—
Number of ways it can happen.
Probability of event=
Total number of ways.
In the application of this rule it should be carefully remembered
that the implied condition that the several ways are equally likely
to happen is absolutely essential to its accuracy. For this it will
be sufficient that no reason exists why one way should happen
rather than another. Mistakes have frequently been fallen into
through want of attention to this necessary condition.
We shall proceed with a few numerical examples on this and
some other most important cases. It will be understood by the
reader that the limits of this article will not admit of giving
the mathematical investigation of the principles, but the several
relations will always be distinctly stated and an example worked
out at length.
CASE I.-Suppose that a bag contains 3 white balls and 5 black balls, and deter-
mine the probability of drawing therefrom a white ball in a single trial.
Here each of the 3 white balls may possibly be the ball with-
drawn, which gives 3 ways in which the event can happen ;
whereas the total number of ways is 8, there being one for every
separate ball, and it is obvious that each of these
ways
is equally
likely. Therefore the required probability of drawing a white
ball is ß; and similarly the probability of drawing a black bal
is g.
The true signification of these results may be thus interpreted.
If a large number of similar trials be made, a white ball may be
expected, on an average, to be drawn at the rate of 3 times in
every
8 trials; and a black ball at the rate of 5 times in every
8 trials.
The sum of the two probabilities is & + :1, and this must
evidently represent the aggregate probability of drawing either
a white or a black ball ; and as this total event is always certain
of fulfilment, it follows that in evaluating probabilities unity
always represents certainty, and is the highest order of pro-
bability.
The foregoing case is perfectly analogous and in all respects
equivalent to the following. A regular octahedron has 3 of its
triangular faces of a white colour and the 5 remaining faces are
black. If it be thrown indiscriminately, the probability that
the uppermost face shall be white is $, and the probability that
it shall be black is g.

CASE II.-A regular octahedron has 3 white triangular faces and the 5 remaining
faces are black. It is required to find the respective values of the probabilities that
in 8 throws a black face shall be presented uppermost 0, 1, 2, 8 times.

denote the initial probabilities of white and black

8pq? + 98, and the indices of p and q in each term indicate the
respective numbers of white and black faces. Hence, employing
the above values of p and q, viz., š and , we thus obtain, to four
places,

By way of illustrating the par-
ticular distribution of the several
events the values of the respective
probabilities are laid off on equi-
distant ordinates in the annexed
diagram, and a continuous curve A
line is traced through the result- og
ing points. This curve is remark-
ably regular in its form when we consider the smallness of the
numbers that enter into the calculation. It is at once perceived
that it exhibits the chief peculiarities of the species of curve
which represents the facility of error; with which it, in fact, be-
comes identical when large numbers enter, and we make a'= B
in order to equalize the probabilities of positive and negative
The most probable event, viz., 3 white and 5 black,
which appertains to the maximum ordinate PM, is that which
theoretically presents the true average of an indefinite number
of trials, and the segments of the abscissa measured from M,
positively and negatively, represent the departures from the
general average, and may be regarded as the errors in respect of
the other events.
Errors of observation are of a similar description. A numerical
result derived from observation must be expected to involve an
error, the magnitude of which is dependent upon the character of
the inquiry and the circumstances attending it. Each value must
be considered as probably greater or less than the truth : in the
errors.

former case it is said to be affected with a positive, in the latter
with a negative error. By an error, it must be understood that
we include only those accidental deviations of which no account
can be given, except that they are found to exist. No variation
is to be called an error which is more likely to be of one sign
than the other. Errors beyond a certain magnitude should
evidently be regarded and estimated as ex-
tremely improbable, and positive and negative
errors should be regarded as equally proba-
ble. The curve which indicates the law of the
facility of error must then be of the kind
shown in the annexed diagram, where m re-
presents the position of the mean or most pro-
bable value; mm a positive error; mm' a negative error; and
each ordinate of the curve exhibits the relative probability
of the corresponding error. The probability of any accurately-
defined value must be inappreciable, since it is only one out
of an infinite number of possible cases; but the probability
of the error falling between two stated values will be finite
and will be properly represented by the curvilinear area com-
prised between the corresponding ordinates. As the error in-
creases on either side of the mean value the probability or facility
appertaining to the error must obviously diminish rapidly in
magnitude, which circumstance is indicated at each extremity by
the asymptotic approach of the curve towards the line of abscissæ.
If x denote mm, the magnitude of the error or variation from the
most probable value, the standard law of facility in regard to
large numbers is-
y =
VEC-
cx?
Ye
co?
e
TT
PM.
where y denotes the ordinate pm, and y the maximum ordinate
The indeterminateness of the constant c will allow of an
adjustment of the law, with a considerable degree of nearness, to
any law which may be presented ; and its assumption will
, in
fact, give a near mathematical approximation to any other law,
and the more nearly, the greater the number of observations.
The constant c is called the modulus of the law of facility, and
its value determines the general amplitude of the variations from
the mean value. As a general rule, the range or amplitude of
divergency varies inversely, and the general persistency of the
results varies directly, as the square root of the modulus of
1
facility. The average divergence is
NTTC
On account of the last-mentioned properties the modulus of
facility of error (c) is also technically called the weight of the
observations. For a given set of individual observations its
numerical value may be determined as being equal to one-half
the reciprocal of the average amongst the squares of the several
estimated errors. The probable error of a single observation is

A
found by dividing .4769 by Nc; and the probable error of the
mean of n observations is found by dividing .4769 by Inc.
The mathematical theory of errors of observation is especially
applicable to statistical tables which exhibit masses of observed
facts properly classified, and, when the observations are nume-
rous, there is a similar law of facility with respect to the varia-
tions of the individual facts from the mean values. In either
case the deviations from the mean values are due to casual and
indiscriminate circumstances which indifferently augment or
diminish the several values ; it being presumed that all disturbing
conditions, which would have any assignable influence upon the
results, have been duly eliminated in forming the tables.
A useful practical test of the reliance that should be placed in
an aggregate table may sometimes be obtained by dividing the
whole of the values observed into two or more portions, and
ascertaining the relative proportions existing amongst the sepa-
rate items, and noting how much they differ one from the other.
The importance of these con-
siderations will be clearly appre-
ciated on an inspection of the
B
accompanying diagrams. The
masses of points, in each, are
supposed to represent a number
of separate observations, and
the central line AB is supposed
to represent the average result
after they are collected in mass
and embodied in a statistical
B
table. It is obvious that the
former table will have more
signification and will possess
much greater value than the A
latter in consequence of the
important circumstance that
less divergency exists and greater persistency prevails amongst
the separate observations, which generally range in the vicinity
of the mean values. This fact, however, is obliterated from the
tables when they exhibit the totals only.
Besides defects of this kind, there are other faults in statistical
methods of inquiry, which it may useful to notice, viz. :-
1. Attributing results to conditions or causes which are only
partially or defectively stated.
2. Assuming certain elementary conditions to be independent
and equally probable which are not so.
3. Comparing quantities which do not admit of satisfactory
comparison, the same not having been observed under similar or
corresponding circumstances.
4. Reasoning upon insufficient numbers, which cannot be free
from the disturbing effects of accidental causes. It is, unfortu-
nately, a too common failing to draw precise, formal, and confident
deductions from a too limited number of observed facts.

It is almost needless to add that these and other imperfections
will disappear when the fundamental principles are more gene-
rally understood and the science of statistics becomes more
extensively investigated.
The use of the following table (page 16), showing the values
of an important integral, will appear in the cases which now
follow.
CASE III.-In 6,000 throws with a die, what is the chance that the number of
aces shall fall within the limits 1,000 + 50; that is, shall lie between 950 and 1,050,
both inclusive?
The particular event in which the numbers are proportional to
the chances is the most probable result; and this is a = 1000
B= 5000, where a denotes the number of throws which are
aces, and B the number which are not aces. The proposed
limits being a + x, the formulæ for calculation are :--
a + B
;
2αβ
this last value being taken out, with the argument t, from the
table on page 16.
Five figure logarithms are convenient for these calculations ;
and, for the present case, the following is the work :-
a + ß
6,000 log 3•77815
2aß 10,000,000 log 7.00000 sub.
C=

x +
2
50:5
log 1.70329
t 1.2370 log t 0.09236
P P= -9198, the required probability.
The chance therefore exceeds 9 to 1 in favour of the aces falling
within the limits mentioned.
The following interesting example is given by Laplace :-
EXAMPLE 2.-Supposing 18 boys are born to 17 girls, in which case out of 14,000 births
the most likely individual result is, that 7, 200 should be boys, and 6,800 girls; what
is the probability that the number of boys shall fall between 7,200 $ 163 inclusive ?
Calculation.
a + B
14000 log 4.14613
2aß 97920000 log 7.99087 sub.

t = 1.9550 log t 0·29115
P .9943
The odds are therefore nearly 175 to 1 in favour of the event.

The foregoing cases serve to calculate the probabilities of
specific events from a knowledge of the circumstances under
which they are to happen or fail. These are direct questions of
probability. In Case V, which follows, we enter on inverse
questions of probability : from a knowledge of the event which
has taken place it is required to find the probability which results
therefrom with reference to a particular set of circumstances
under which it might have happened. These calculations are
founded upon the general principle that when an event may have
happened in several different ways, that way which is most
likely to bring about the event is the most likely to have been
the cause.
CASE V.-Supposing that in 1,000 trials an event has occurred 600 times and
failed 400 times, what is the probability that the true chance of the occurrence of the
600 + 30
event in one trial is comprised within the limits
inclusive ?

The odds are therefore more than 19 to 1 in favour of the pro-
posed supposition.
The next case will enable us to judge of the probability of future
events from those which are past, on the supposition that the
circumstances under which the latter were produced continue in
operation. This is essentially the very problem, above all others,
that must be continually presented in the course of practical
experience. It is mathematically discussed by referring the
event to every possible cause, deducing the probability of each
separate cause from the event, and then deducing the probability
of the coming event from each of the possible causes, and finally
determining the total probability by a process of summation,

EXAMPLE.-According to the Life Office returns, upon which the “New Ex-
perience" life tables are founded, out of 41,385 lives (male and female) age 41, there
were 445 deaths, giving 40,940 survivors at the expiration of one year:-

dying in one year is contained between the limits 445 = 30

inclusive?

The probability of No. 1 is nearly equal to that of No. 3, and
would obviously be identical with the latter if the limits were
only slightly extended to 445 + 30%. Thus we find that the
41385
formula of Cases III and V suggest the following interesting
theorem.
TAEOREM. If in a + B observations an event has been observed to happen a
times and to fail B times, the probability that the true chance of the event lies
between the limits a (x + 1) is equal to the probability that in a + B observa-
at B
tions the number of occurrences of the event shall lie between the limits a Ł%,
assuming in the latter case that the true chance of the event is known to be
a + B
In the two cases involved in this theorem, the difference of
in the values of x is deducible from the consideration that the
ordinate (y) of the curve of facility of error may be regarded as
practically representing the probability that an error shall fall
within the limits x † }; and that the middle or maximum
ordinate (Y) may similarly represent the probability of the error
being comprised within the limits + }
The principal questions appertaining to the collection, classifi-
cation, and discussion of statistics are briefly comprehended in
the foregoing cases. The practical resolution of these questions
only requires a slight knowledge of logarithms of numbers, and
is effected by simply following out the method of working
exhibited in the various examples. In the several calculations
it will be perceived that instead of using negative indices to
logarithms, the complements to 10 are put down and used as
positive indices, according to the convenient custom of experienced
computers in the higher departments of mathematics ; thus, in
all additions, subtractions, &c., it is only requisite to reject and
borrow 10 whenever necessary.

а
In almost every branch of statistical inquiry the quantities
which enter are subject to deviations from the normal values,
arising from a combination of innumerable minute circum-
stances, of which the variations due to each are separately very
small. The total change from the mean value is of course pro-
duced by the superposition of these minute variations, some of
which tend towards an excess and others towards a defect.
When the number of observations is small, they are not unlikely
to comprise a number of exceptional cases, in which the greater
part of the variations repeatedly tend in the same direction, namely,
all towards excess or all towards defect, thus producing diver-
gent results in that particular direction, and these exceptional
cases may comprise such a proportion of the total observations
as to considerably affect the average result. But when the
number of observations is large, the occurrence of such excep-
tional variations, in one direction only, becomes highly impro-
bable, and the exceptions necessarily form such an inappreciable
proportion of the total facts, that the disturbing effects become
practically neutralized. Thus it is that, although but little
dependence can be placed in deductions or conclusions drawn
from small numbers, there will certainly be found to exist general
laws amongst masses of phenomena, of whatever description,
physical or moral, which in the invariable and perpetual recur-
rence of events of the same kind, as the numbers augment,
necessarily approximate towards fixed and determinate ratios.
It is also evident that every conclusion will have greater weight,
and the approximation to normal results must be greatly assisted
and expedited, when the more prominent circumstances which
tangibly affect the observations admit of being wholly eliminated,
or, still
better, of being separately classified and tabulated.
In that case the phenomena appertaining to each set of cir-
cumstances or conditions would come under separate and distinct
investigation, instead of the more complicated phenomena
arising from their diversified combinations. If, however, the
various conditions, which principally affect the quantities, do not
admit of separation, there will be no alternative but to enlarge
the number of observations, if such should be possible, until a
reasonable presumption is shown that they present a sufficient
accumulation of experience for the purpose of eliciting the
required results with a very small probability of error.
As a concluding remark I may add that in this paper I have
endeavoured, briefly and practically, to explain some of the most
useful and important results and applications of the mathematical
theory; and that I shall be glad if it should in any degree
assist in directing more attention to the neglected logical science
of statistics.

THE FINE ARTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL
EXHIBITION.
IT
may afford matter for wholesome reflection to carry the
memory back twenty years, and recall the feelings with which
the Great Exhibition of 1851 was regarded. A collection of
works of art and industry to which all the nations of the earth
were invited to contribute, was such a startling novelty, that
the idea almost turned the heads not merely of its most active
promoters, but also of the general public. The newspapers of
the period teemed with boastful anticipations. In presence of
the amicable rivalry inaugurated by industry and commerce,
war would speedily be viewed as a barbarous anachronism, and
a millennium of universal peace and disarmament might shortly
be expected to commence. It is scarcely necessary to say that
hitherto these sanguine anticipations have been utterly falsified.
The civilised world, instead of growing more pacific, has become
far more warlike during the last twenty years, and though at
the present moment there is a lull in the strife, the chief nations
of Europe are watching each other's movements with ill concealed
jealousy and suspicion. Yet the scheme which was originated in
1851 has not proved a barren failure. On the contrary it has
thriven and multiplied so that the conception of international
industrial displays which twenty years ago intoxicated the world
with its novelty has now become perfectly common-place and
familiar. Wherein then was the error of the men of 1851 ? Their
error consisted in imagining that rivalry in arts and industry
was necessarily incompatible with rivalry in arms. Melancholy
experience has subsequently taught the world that nations though
ready to trade with each other, are equally ready to fight.
The Exhibition of 1871 stands on a totally different footing
to its predecessors. They were dazzling novelties, reappearing,
like comets, only at distant intervals of time; whereas the
series of exhibitions commenced this year, may, on the contrary,
be compared to the rotation of a steady-going planet, since they
are intended to perform a regular annual course. The trading
element, moreover, which vulgarised the old Exhibitions and
rendered their stalls too much like reproductions of Regent-street
and Oxford-street shop windows, has been restrained within due
limits by a rigorous system of classification and selection. Works
are no longer displayed simply because Mr. X, or Mr. Y, chooses
to send them, but because they are in themselves worth looking
at, and form part of the Commissioners' prescribed series of
subjects. Many persons feared that the absence of this obtu-
sive element in the Exhibition would render it less attractive to
the public at large. But the public have shown, by the ample
patronage which they have extended, that they are quite as
capable of appreciating a genuine exposition which appeals to
their taste and their understanding, as of visiting a mere show

names.
which principally excites wonder and curiosity. This public
patronage has no doubt been stimulated by the opening of that
wonderful structure, the Albert Hall, and by the completion of
the railway system which renders South Kensington so accessible
from all parts of the metropolis ; but, on the other hand, the
exciting events of the Franco-German war, followed by the
terrible incidents of the civil conflict in Paris, tended con-
siderably to indispose men's minds for the contemplation of
industrial and artistic productions, besides crippling the display
of the two foremost nations of continental Europe.
So many thousands of people have visited the Exhibition for
themselves, and its contents have been so thoroughly and ex-
haustively discussed in the columns of the newspapers, that it
would be unadvisable here to repeat an oft-told tale, which,
moreover, in the limited space at command, would probably
present the dry and repulsive character of a mere catalogue of
It is proposed, therefore, to confine the scope of the
present essay to the Fine Arts division of the Exhibition, under
which are included Paintings in Oil and Water-colour, Mosaics,
and Stained Glass, Sculpture, Furniture, and Metal Work,
Engravings on Wood and Metal, Photography, Lithography,
Architectural Designs, Tapestries, Carpets, Shawls, Lace, and
Embroidery. In touching on these subjects respectively, our
aim will be to discuss them broadly, and instead of dwelling too
minutely on individual specimens, to search for results, and dis-
cover wherein improvement and progress are chiefly discernible.
With this object in view free use will be made of the excellent
Official Reports on the various sections of the Exhibition which
have recently been published.
Attention is naturally first attracted to paintings in oil, con-
cerning which Sir Coutts Lindsay has furnished a very instruc-
tive Report. In 1851 no pictures were admitted ; but a com-
parison may be fitly instituted between the display of the
present year and that of 1862. 1862 was in Europe a year of pro-
found peace, and the paintings exhibited represented the art of an
entire century. France produced the works of her most illustrious
masters, from the period before as well as since the Revolution ;
Belgium, Holland, Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia were fairly,
though less completely, represented; while the English gallery
was graced with the productions of the fathers of our native
schools of painting, as well as with those of their immediate
descendants, and of their living successors ; thus comprising
three complete generations of painters. The scope of the Exhi-
bition of 1871 was narrower, being intended chiefly to represent
the labours of the last ten years, while, at the same time, the
shadow of a terrible war brooded over Europe. Consequently.
with the exception of Belgium, the continental galleries were
either occupied by inferior works, or were not filled at all.
The British Art Exhibition was large, extending over nearly
as much space as that of all the foreigners put together ; but it
cannot be considered as a satisfactory representation of our con-

temporary painting. The number of pictures was considerable,
and the average worthy of exhibition, but there were but few
of the best works of our leading painters, and the collection was
diluted with indifferent works more appropriate to the forth-
coming yearly Exhibitions.
The small knot of masters who, during the latter half of the
eighteenth century, gave existence to the modern school of
English painting, were all of them self-taught men, and, though
often cramped by an incompleteness in the technical knowledge
of their profession, they possessed a marvellous originality of
purpose and variety of resources. The influence of these men
is still very great, and will probably never disappear: and the
habit of self-education and self-guidance which they inculcated
still continues to characterise English art. The rigid training of
foreign schools, which produced a series of painters exhibiting in
their works the familiar lineaments of their artistic ancestry, is
unknown here, and, consequently, it is not possible to arrange
English paintings in distinct classes, but, at the same time, a
similar bias of mind has gathered many of our artists into certain
groups. One of the most remarkable of these groups was that of
the Pre-Raphaelites, who started into existence some years ago,
inspired with an abhorrence of the conventional style which
passed for art, and with an unbounded belief in the strict imita-
tion of Nature. The leaders of this school have since receded
from their more intolerant doctrines, but the main idea whick
they promulgated has leavened the whole of British art.
Among other groups may be mentioned one which derives its
distinctiveness from its intimacy with the ancient art-traditions
of Greece and Italy. For a long time “high art," as it was called,
was sneered at both by artists and by the public, nor did the
genius of Haydon, marred as it was by serious defects, greatly
benefit the cause which he advocated so passionately ; but
latterly such men as Mr. Watts, Mr. Armitage, and Mr. Herbert,
holding Haydon's views, but advocating them with far greater
patience and prudence, have obtained a considerable and ever-
increasing influence. The genius of Wilkie, again, has formed a
distinct group of painters ; among them may be mentioned the
names of Mulready, Frith, Leslie, and Faed. Lastly, attention
should be directed to a knot of artists who have imported into
their oil paintings many of the excellencies which had previously
been considered the exclusive heritage of water-colours ; such
men, for example, as F. Walker, Marks, Burne Jones, and Leslie.
Sir Edwin Landseer, who, in his delineations of the animal
kingdom, may be said to have opened a new chapter in art, can
scarcely be said to have founded a school, his followers are so
few in number. This consummate master was very inadequately
represented in the Exhibition by his “Highland Lassie," and
" Van Amburgh ;" nor was there in the collection any example
of the works of the late Mr. Phillip, a masterly painter, but who,
unfortunately, confined his delineations to a narrow range. The
same criticism may be applied to Mr. Hook; whereas with
с

Mr. Millais, his range has broadened with experience, and his
power strengthened with
age.
The progress ma le by the British school of oil painting during
the last decade appears principally remarkable for the growing
influence of water-colour painters on oil painting, for the in-
creasing influence of the Ideal School of Art, typified by Mr.
Watts and Mr. Leighton, and for a disposition among painters
to take a wider range in their subjects, which now include the
production of ideal composition, of portrait and landscape paint-
ing, and also the study of the Sculptor's art. Close societies of
painters, moreover, are giving up their exclusiveness, while the
large galleries now opened to the public afford the great deside-
ratum for art, namely, publicity in a fitting place for its appre-
ciation.
Turning to the foreign pictures, the first impression received
from the Belgian Gallery was the great average excellence (far
above the ordinary English standard) of the works exhibited. A
workmanlike completeness reigned throughout, every artist had
approached near his intention. This power arises from an early
training under approved masters chosen by the pupil himself,
and carried out in company with fellow-pupils of a lik bias.
The French Gallery had a very imposing class of pictures,
brought together, under circumstances of great difficulty, with
wonderful energy and success. Their exhibition included
various works painted during the last half century by Isabey,
Ingres, Scheffer, Delaroche, and others of a still older generation,
besides many specimens of the present school. Most persons
wbo visited the Exhibition were attracted by the genius of
Regnault's “ Execution in a Moor's Palace,” though repelled by
the revolting nature of the subject. Gerôme's picture affords a
very faint idea of his merits, but he has been adequately repre-
sented this year in the Royal Academy. His cynicism leaves a
painful impression on the mind of those most capable of appre-
ciating him. His “Cleopatra," for example, and his “ Ave
Cæsar,” are the conceptions of a man who despises and despairs
of the state of society in which he lives. Two gems by Meis-
sonier deserve a word of notice. As a miniature painter of sub-
jects he has never been equalled, and his marvellous vivacity of
colour, drawing, and expression, are not to be surpassed.
Mr. Samuel Redgrave observes that although some of the
early Dutch painters in oil produced occasional works in
water-colours, that department of art may justly claim to be
peculiarly English. It originated during the latter half of the
eighteenth century with the draughtsmen who were employed in
perpetuating the ancient ecclesiastical edifices and mansions
many of which were fast falling into decay. Their drawings
were correctly described by the word “ tinted,” for being begun
in Indian ink, or some greyish neutral colour, and thus finished
so far as regards light and shade and form, some colour was
added by a weak tint thinly washed in. The constant inter-
course with nature, which was forced upon these men, soon pro-

duced greater excellence, and the school of water-colour artists
arose whose works are now so highly prized by connoisseurs. It
is sufficient to mention the names of Turner, Girtin, Thomas
and Paul Sandby, Rooker, and Cozens. At first water-colour
drawings were exhibited at the Royal Academy, but after a
while (in 18.4) these artists grew strong enough to establish a
society of their own. Turner, being already an Academician,
was not of the body, but it included such men as Glover, Pyne,
John Chalon and Varley, who again were subsequently joined
by De Wint, Copley Fielding, Cox, Robson, and Hunt. All these
men won their fame by the simple use of transparent colours. With
transparent colours Turner produced the most refined gradations
of tint, and the most brilliant effects of light, and he declared that
water-colour painting would lose all its individuality and beauty
by the practice of mingling opaque and transparent colours. In
spite of this dictum, water-colour painters have been led within
the last few years to the use of body-colours, not for the principal
lights only, or for foreground objects, but also for mid-distance
and sky. Body colour gives, with little labour, the appearance
of power and dash, with great command of light and shade, but
it sacrifices the most esteemed characteristics of water-colour
art. The fact is, that the art is in a state of transition, its
painters are abandoning the ground on which many men esta-
blished an enduring reputation, and are gradually exchanging
the art of tinting on paper for the ancient system of tempera, in
which gradations of body-colour cover the paper, which is treated
merely as a canvas, its white surface no longer representing the
quality of light shining under transparent washes of colour. And
as at the same time several distinguished painters in oil, Messrs.
Marks and F. Walker, for example, have been led to discard the
use of oil in mixing their pigments, it is evident that the border-
land between the two methods of art is less clearly defined than
it used to be. Nearly 500 water-colour drawings of British
origin were displayed in the recent Exhibition, while very few
were furnished by continental artists.
The charming art of miniature painting, examples of which
are now so highly prized, has, as is well known, been almost
killed by photography. There were, however, two cases of minia-
tures at the Exhibition, which showed that their painters, if
duly encouraged, could fully maintain the supremacy of their
predecessors. This encouragement, however, is not likely to be
afforded, and the miniature painter of the future must be con-
tent to work in conjunction with the photographer.
Turning to miscellaneous painting, the Report on which is fur-
nished by Sir W. Digby Wyatt, we may observe that there were
in the Exhibition several pretty illustrations of furniture deco-
rated with painting, principally through the medium of coloured
faïence plaques inserted as pictures in the sides of chests, side-
boards, &c. Amongst them was conspicuous the large wooden
coffer raised on legs, and enriched on its principal side by a
capital reproduction in earthenware of Mr. Marks's clever “May-

a
day Procession.” The painting of this was executed by female
students at South Kensington, and the same hands painted in
blue camaieu the figures of “The Months,” designed by Mr. E. J.
Poynter, A.R.A., for the grill-room of the Museum. Mention
should also be made of a very pretty blackwood cabinet enriched
with figures and ornaments sunk in sotto-relievo, and painted in
red and white ; of a piano in light wood stained to a satinwood
tint, and covered with ornament boldly designed, and painted in
monochrome in little more than outline ; of a satinwood cabinet
painted in quasi-imitation of the style of Old English satinwood
which used to be prettily enriched with paintings after and by
Bartolozzi, Angelica Kauffmann and others; and of a Japanese
cabinet decorated with flowers, plants, and birds, all executed in
the most brilliant colours by means of stained glass and straw
mosaic.
The Exhibition also contained a number of china plaques in-
tended for mounting on furniture. Among such may be named
Mr. George Gray's “Maid and Magpie,” Mr. John Simpson's
" Village Choir,” Vr. F. Lapf's “Judith with the Head of Holo-
fernes," and M. Emile Lessore with his admirable groups of
children, and studies from nature and the old masters.
Till recently Paris was the only place where a really artistic
fan could be procured. But the Fan Exhibition at South Ken-
sington showed that up to the close of the last century Italy,
Spain, and England maintained a lively competition with France.
This elegant art seems now likely to revive, and will afford an
excellent opportunity for the ingenuity and dexterity of educated
The highest prizes for the fans recently shown were
awarded to three members of one family, the Misses Montalba.
England is assuredly the country for mosaic, says Mr. T.
Gambier Parry. We need its durability and its lustre. Where
other systems of Art would only make darkness darker, lustrous
mosaic multiplies on its thousand surfaces every gleam of light,
and reflects its own reflections. A great sensation was caused i
by the German invention of water-glass, but its success is doubt-
ful, for two of the three works executed on this system, namely,
Mr. Maclise's “Waterloo” and “ Trafalgar," are already rapidly
perishing. This is not to be wondered at if we call to mind that
water-glass is but the delicate film which shines on the golden
surface of our autumn straws of corn. When winter comes,
water-glass and straw perish together. Mr. Minton Campbell's
system of mosaic painting, on the contrary, combines the
mechanism and durability of mosaic with the freedom of oil-
painting. A surface of mosaic tesseræ of any extent may be
painted
as a man would paint canvas. The surface thus painted
may be broken up into groups of tesseræ, and painting, which
though treated like oil, is in fact vitreous, may be burnt in by the
furnace, and rendered as imperishable as mosaic. Mr. Campbell's
system was well illustrated by the figure of “Ghiberti," by Mr.
Fisk, and a group of a Hunter, his Hawk, and Dog, by
Mr. Marks.

The best foreign specimen of glass-painting was that by Von
Swertskoff in the Pottery gallery. Its bold design is admirable
for its purpose, which, instead of filling a window in a small
room, and close to the eye, is rather that of giving splendour to
a distant architectural effect. In entire contrast to this were
Messrs. Heaton and Co.'s refined illustrations of “Elaine,” in the
Meyrick Gallery. With domestic glass, which this is anything is
allowable within the range of good taste.
Turning next to Mr. Westmacott's Report on Sculpture, we
note that there are two propositions which should be carefully
borne in mind when estimating Fine Art Sculpture. First, its
function is to represent by form; and secondly, the forms chosen
should be the best that can be found in the great school of Nature
-Nature, that is, in her normal beauty and perfection, not as she is
often, and indeed generally seen after the wear and tear of life,
in what may be considered accidental deterioration or deviation
from the first pure and perfect rule of creation. This was the
standard adopted by the greatest masters of sculpture, when the art
stood at its highest point of excellence. For this reason little im-
provement of public taste is to be expected from the contempla-
tion of portrait-sculpture, which naturally reproduces personal
peculiarities (often the reverse of beautiful), and which in these
days must either drape the figure of a man in a fancy costume
which he never really wore, or must else adopt the stiff ugliness
of modern garments. It is worth observing that portrait-sculp-
ture was not practised by the Greeks in the age of Phidias, when
the art was at its greatest perfection, but arose in the days of
Alexander the Great when it was beginning to decline.
British sculptors, as well as British painters, cannot, like their
continental brethren, be classed under distinct divisions, and the
reason is much the same in either case. Sculpture was even later
than painting in taking root among us, and up to the end of the
last century the art in this country was exclusively in the hands
of foreigners.
The greater number of sculptured works in the late Exhibi-
tion were contributed by artists of Great Britain. They have
nearly all been previously before the public, and have under-
gone public criticism; it is sufficient, therefore, to remark that
they entitle their authors to hold an honourable place in the
practice of their art. Italy contributed some works of very
superior merit. Her statuary deserves notice for its truth and
careful execution. There is alwaysmas is the case with other.
continental schools-indication of sound and careful elementary
training, a point in which English exhibitors are sometimes
deficient. Belgium and Germany were well represented, nor did
France, though late in the field, belie her ancient reputation.
Mr. Hungerford Pollen remarks, that in the matter of artistic
furniture great improvements have taken place since 1851. Art
in this branch had then sunk very low, for the excellent cabinet-
makers of the last century had left no successors. The present
improvement is due partly to the effect of the good designs and

careful workmanship of France, Italy, and other foreign countries,
and partly to the research made both here and on the continent
into the good designs of furniture-makers of the sixteenth and
following centuries. Yet it must be confessed that the improve-
ment has not penetrated very deeply into society, and also that, as
in architecture, it seems impossible to produce anything that
shall be original and yet artistic. All our artistic modern fur-
niture is a mere reproduction of the designs of bygone masters.
The specimens shown in the Exhibition, which ranged over every
period, classic, medieval, Renaissance, and the later centuries, can
scarcely have failed to educate the eyes of some of the thousands
who have examined them. Independently, however, of the slow-
ness with which public taste is necessarily cultivated in a matter
of this kind, there are two practical hindrances in the way. In
the first place, for the great mass of house furnishers of moderate
means, the artistic furniture is high-priced in comparison with
ordinary vulgar upholstery ; and in the second place, modern
English society is very nomadic in its habits. People who are
always shifting from house to house and from city to city are
apt to regard their tables and chairs rather as impedimenta than
as cherished heir-looms.
Under the head of Metal Work, notice may first be taken of
the various racing cups exhibited, of varying degrees of excel-
lence, but in several showing ignorance of the true principles of
art; as for instance, where the ground is corroded into a rough
green patine, to represent the grass on which deer are standing,
or, worse still, when in a vessel composed of silver, bunches of grapes
are represented by green and purple precious stones, and the leaves
are enamelled green. Any baser metal would in this case have
done just as well as the silver, which is wholly hidden by enamel-
ling or gilding. The rage for novelty, which does so much to
vulgarise British art, is probably responsible for this piece of mis-
applied labour.
A volume might be devoted to the specimens of Oriental metal
work. The goldsmiths' and jewelled productions from India were
of especial beauty; minute in an extraordinary degree, examples
of elaborate handwork not readily got where skilled labour, as
with us, is rare and expensive. The enamels from Jeypore, how-
ever, where the gold is completely invested with enamel colours
and encrusted with precious stones, err in the same direction as
the Doncaster racing cup. Mention must also be made of the
silver work, filagree, gilt, chased, or engraved ; of the Kooftgari
work-iron or steel, inlaid with gold, from the Punjaub; and of
the wash utensils, goblets, &c., used in worship from Madras and
Benares.
A very instructive and clearly written account of the various
processes of Engraving, and of their progress, will be found in the
official reports respectively issued by Mr. Julian Marshall and
Mr. T. J. Gullick. It will suffice here to indicate some of the
leading distinctions between the three principal branches of the
art, namely, engraving on metal, etching, and engraving on

wood. In line engraving, the artist ploughs lines on the surface
of a metal plate. After the design is completed, the plate is
inked, and then wiped dry. On being submitted to the action
of the press, the ink which lies in the furrows produces black
lines on the paper, while the unengraved portions of the plate
remain white. In mezzotint, which is another description of
metal engraving, a plate is prepared in such a manner, that an
impression from it would be entirely black; the engraver then
scrapes off portions of the surface where he wishes to place the
highest lights, and thus, without any decided outlines, obtains
an effect of great softness and richness. In this case, the most
prominent parts of the plate are those which retain the ink,
while those which are sunk the deepest transfer the least colour to
the paper. These two styles of engraving are now generally
used in combination. In etching, a metal plate is covered with
a varnished surface, on which the artist sketches his design
with a sharp pointed tool. The plate is then exposed to the
action of an acid which corrodes those parts scratched by the
needle and therefore unprotected by the varnish. The lines are
afterwards retouched and improved by the needle alone, without
the aid of acid. The great advantage of etching is, that the
artist can express his ideas direct, without the intervention of
an engraver. As a material for engraving that shall be effective
at small cost, wood possesses several advantages over metal
surfaces. The bux-wood used by engravers, though hard
enough to resist pressure and bear minute subdivision, is much
softer to cut than copper or steel. The dark parts of line
engravings can only be obtained by a toilsome system of
“hatching," whereas a wood-block in an untouched state yields a
mass of black. But as large spaces of the wood are easily gouged
out, breadth of light is equally at command. The logical deduc-
tion is, that breadth and vigour of light and shade should dis-
tinguish a wood-cut. Other advantages of wood engraving are,
that as it is the prominent and not the sunken part which yields
the impression, the blocks can be used as types, and wedged up
in a chase in connection with letter-press : and also that, as
large drawings are executed on several pieces of box-wood
screwed together, these component pieces can be distributed to
as many engravers as there are pieces. On the other hand, from
the granulousness and comparative softness of wood, and from
the nature of the cutting process and mode of printing, the lines
of the wood engraver can never possess the sweetness and pre-
cision of those vielded by metal; and whenever (as is too often
the case) a wood engraver attempts to give his cut the appearance
of a copper or steel plate engraving, he sacrifices the peculiar
advantages of his art. The early masters generally confined
themselves to the simplest means, trusting to the expressiveness
of their lines and the effective contrast of their light and shade.
After the publication of Holbein's “Dance of Death,” than
which nothing more simple and satisfactory in execution has
appeared, the art of wood engraving declined throughout Europe,

and in England was employed for little more than cheap book
and penny ballad illustrations, till revived about a century ago
by Thomas Bewick. He may be regarded as the father of the
present school of wood-engraving. Photography, though a
valuable handmaid to wood-engraving, if cautiously used, is not
likely to prove a dangerous rival, so long as the process of print-
ing from photographs remains comparatively slow and cumbrous.
The Graphotype, however, may prove a more successful com-
petitor. In this process, the artist draws on a block of com-
pressed chalk with a chemical ink, which hardens the chalk
wherever it touches it. The interstices between the lines are
then brushed away, leaving the drawing in relief. The whole
surface is then chemically hardened, and a mould taken, from
which an electrotype block is obtained. Like etching, this pro-
cess possesses the great advantage of preserving the designer's
original handiwork.
Contemporary wood-engraving was but slenderly represented in
this Exhibition. Of some of its principal phases there were no
examples whatever. We cannot compare the style of the en-
gravings from Mulready with those from Millais. Neither the
incomparable Leech, nor any of the principal living designers
from“Punch” were represented. None of the illustrations to the
“ Cornhill Magazine” by various able draughtsmen were shown,
and there was only one Doré. The “Art Journal” and the
“Illustrated London News” were only represented indirectly by a
few works contributed by engravers. The latter journal might
have furnished materials for an almost complete history of wood-
engraving during
the last five-and-twenty years.
Lieut.-Colonel Stuart Wortley, in his Report on Photography,
observes that the display of photography in this year's Exhibi-
tion shows a marked advance on any previous International
Exhibition in two important points: first, there is a more
earnest seeking after art; and, secondly, several processes have
been discovered for giving permanence to the photographic print,
and for producing it with greater economy and simplicity. The
manipulation of a photographic negative has hardly, for some
years past, been capable of much improvement, but a wider
range of subjects is now attempted, and they are handled in a
more artistic fashion.
The new photographic processes may be conveniently divided
into two classes, namely, those in which the printing is conducted
by every print being taken direct from the negative, and those
in which the negative is used to produce a matrix from which
the prints are afterwards mechanically obtained. To the first of
these classes belong the carbon prints, exhibited by the Autotype
Fine Art Company. The foundation of this process lies in the
fact, that a solution of gelatine, and one of the bichromates, is
rendered insoluble by the action of light. A mixture of gelatine
and bichromate of potash, or ammonia, together with a suffi-
ciency of pigment to give the requisite colour to the finished
print, is spread on a sheet of paper. This prepared paper, or

a
tissue, after being printed through an ordinary photographic
negative, is soaked in cold water, and placed in contact with a
support of paper, zinc, or glass. The support, with its gelatine
picture attached, being next placed in hot water, the gelatine
dissolves in exact proportion to the amount of light which has
acted on it through the lights and shades of the negative, and so
delicate is the action of light on the prepared tissue, that the
half-tones between the lights and shadows of the picture are accu-
rately rendered. The gelatine print then either remains on the
support that was selected for it, or is re-transferred to another on
which it is permanently to remain. Among the specimens of
this process which especially attracted attention at the Exhi-
bition, were some copies of drawings by the old masters,
some architectural views, and copies of original oil-paintings.
The Woodbury-type process, invented by Mr. W. B. Wood-
bury, belongs to the second division, and is also based on
the peculiar property of gelatine above referred to. A mix-
ture of gelatine and bichromate of potash combined with a little
Indian-ink, is prepared in the form of a thin sheet, and when
dry is exposed to the action of light through a negative. It is
then taken from the negative, and attached to a plate of glass by
means of a coating of india-rubber. This is placed in warm
water until the solution of the gelatine, in all parts where the
light has not acted, is complete. When dry, the gelatine sheet is
removed from the glass, and the image is seen upon it in relief,
the shadows being the thickest, and the lights the most attenuated.
This gelatine relief is now placed in contact with a soft metal
plate, the two plates are submitted to powerful pressure, and the
details of the gelatine relief are thus impressed into the metal.
Curiously enough, the gelatine film is none the worse for this
rough treatment, and can be used again to impress other metal
plates. The metal plate is then placed in a printing press, some
ink composed of water-colour ground up in gelatine is poured on
its centre, a piece of paper is laid on this, the press is closed, and
after the lapse of about a minute the print will be found to have
set. The prints are then soaked in a solution of alum, in order to
render the gelatine completely insoluble, and are then dried and
mounted as ordinary prints. It will be observed that in this
process the gelatinous ink lies thickly in the bollows of the matrix,
and thinly on the elevations, thus forming the lights and
shadows. In Mr. Ernest Edwards' heliotype process, the prints
are taken direct from the gelatine film, which is strengthened for
that
purpose
with a little chrome alum. The process is as fol-
lows. A glass plate having been waxed to prevent adherence,
the gelatine mixture is poured on it, so as to form a tolerably
thick film. This film is removed, and exposed to light through a
negative. It is then fastened to a metal plate, and after being
soaked in water to remove the superfluous bichromate, is ready
Several inkings are required, inks of various
thicknesses being successively used, so as to do justice not only
to the half-tones and lights, but to the deeper shadows ; but as
a
for the press.

these inks may be of varying colours, the power of the manipu-
lator is obviously increased by this apparent disadvantage.
With reference to other recently discovered processes, the enamel
process by Mr. Henderson, and the Dallastype, by Mr. J. W.
Dallas, are both represented by good results, but in neither of
these cases has the invention been so widely applied as to render
details necessary.
In his interestmg report on Architectural Designs, Mr. T. Roger
Smith remarks that Architecture stands necessarily at a disad-
vantage in an Exhibition compared with painting or sculpture.
In the case of the two latter arts the works themselves can be
displayed, whereas an architect can only show designs of his
building, and a design is only a representation of the archi-
tectural work as it looks from a single point of view. On the
other hand it must be fairly admitted that architectural designs
often look both more imposing and more attractive than the real
buildings. This remark especially applies to contemplated im-
provements in great cities. The site in reality is frequently cooped
up in narrow streets, hemmed in by mean houses, and defiled
by dirt and coal smoke, whereas, in the hands of the architect's
draughtsman all appears fresh, bright, and picturesque, with
plenty of space to spare.
Mr. Smith begins by a rapid sketch of the history of Euro-
pean architecture. For a thousand years after the Christian
era, nearly all European buildings were constructed after the
Roman manner, which itself was based on the style wrought
out by the Greeks for themselves. This architecture, broadly
distinguished by the term Romanesque, was supplanted about
the time of the Crusades by the Gothic, or Mediæval style,
which lasted from the 12th to the end of the 15th century.
Then came the revival of Greek and Roman literature, accom-
panied by a revival of Roman architecture under the name of
Renaissance. In England at the beginning of the present
century, after a long period of inartistic stagnation, a gallant,
but only partially successful attempt was made to revive Greek
architecture. Mediævalism, which Sir Walter Scott had made
fashionable, presently led the way for a far more successful
revival of Gothic architecture. The Gothic revival is still in full
force, though it has not superseded the earlier Renaissance or
Roman. Renaissance art has flourished more or less in every
European country, but English practice has been chiefly in-
fluenced by the developments of this style in Italy and France.
In Italy the Classic revival was carried out with much purity of
taste and refinement of detail, while in France more variety has
been introduced. France, like ourselves, has had a Greek and
Gothic revival within the present century, but Greek art has
there taken a stronger hold than Gothic, and the term néo-grec is
sometimes applied to that powerful architectural school whose
style, resulting from a fusion of revived Roman with revived
Greek, was displayed in all the buildings of the later years of
the reign of Napoleon III.

a
Our own architects can no longer be divided, as they might
have been a few years ago, into Classicists and Gothicists. A fair
statement of the actual position of English architecture would be
that revived Greek is abandoned, but that Renaissance, largely
tinctured by features borrowed from France, is widely practised;
that Elizabethan art is freely employed in domestic work, but
that the most energetic and living architecture is Gothic, based
on earlier models (namely, those of the twelfth and thirteenth cen-
turies,) than in Pugin's time. Here, as in kindred arts, we seem
to have little or no original power, and can only show our taste by
copying the brain-work of bygone masters. Possibly new wants,
such as those caused by railway communication ; new materials,
such as iron and glass ; old materials revived, such as terra-cotta
and mosaic ; may develop a new, and (Mr. Smith hopes) a noble
style. In fact, a new style has been developed, and may be seen
at most of our larger railway stations ; it may be convenient, but
it is decidedly utilitarian, and only too faithfully reflects the spirit
of the era in which it originated. The truth is, that those past
ages which developed original forms of art possessed a certain some-
thing, Faith, Simplicity, Self-abnegation, it is a subtle quality,
and may be called by a variety of names—which all our money and
all our science cannot buy. Indeed, it takes flight from what we
call civilisation, and prefers to dwell among semi-barbarous peoples.
But though our architects have not been able to develop a new
style, it must not be supposed that they have slavishly repro-
duced past forms. On the contrary, their search after novelty
has been restless and incessant. Features drawn from the art of
various countries, climates, and epochs, are often introduced into
one and the same design : a practice wherein great artistic skill is
needed to avoid discord. Often, too, novel features and modes of
treatment, growing healthily and naturally out of the materials
and circumstances of the day, have been successfully combined
with old forms.
Among the designs exhibited were two interesting drawings of
Westminster Palace as the design stood in 1843. All the details
were to be strictly in conformity with the best English examples
of the architecture of the period selected, and Sir C. Barry was
assisted in his researches by Pugin. A comparison with any
recent Gothic design by a good hand will show how rapidly archi-
tecture has moved since then.
These drawings are also interesting in showing some important
divergences from the building as actually executed. A glance
at Mr. Street's design for the new Law Courts bears out the truth
of the assertion as to progress. The successful design for the
Manchester Town Hall may be taken as a good example of the
Gothic of the day; it possesses a great deal of continental
character and many ornamental features. Attention may next
be called to two works by Mr. E. M. Barry, R.A., viz., the
Cannon-street Hotel, London, which is in an ornate Renaissance
style, with the storeys distinctly marked, decorative chimneys
and towers, and important roofs; and a design for the New

National Gallery in a robust manner of Italian Renaissance.
The premises of the General Credit Company in Lothbury re-
produce with accuracy and spirit a Venetian building in London
streets ; a business house in Throgmorton Street possesses many
features drawn from Italian Gothic, while a gabled city ware-
house shows a French Gothic character. These are encouraging
signs, and may, it is to be hoped, penetrate lower down, but the
vulgarity and flimsiness which characterise a large portion of
our street architecture is due not so much to the want of com-
petent architects as to the vicious leasehold system which throws
the bulk of our city building operations into the hands of igno-
rant and needy men. Next, as specimens of metropolitan
improvements, may be ranked together St. Thomas's Hospital,
the London Orphan Asylum, Columbia Market, the Metropolitan
Meat Market, and the Holborn Viaduct. Turning to the pro-
vinces, it is refreshing to see that the dull dignity which is
supposed to befit a bank has been broken at Altrincham, where
a building of the half-timbered English domestic work, of which
fine examples exist in that locality, is to be erected. Mr. Water-
house's design for the Manchester Assize Courts should not be
passed over, for these courts, which were erected a few years ago,
and are very extensive and conspicuous, have had much influence
in fixing public taste in the North of England. The same archi-
tect exhibited a view of the Natural History Museum to be built
at South Kensington. The design is in a round arched style
approaching Gothic, and is well adapted on account of the small
blocks which can be used in its construction for execution in brick
and terra-cotta. Altogether this work is one of the most hopeful
and encouraging designs exhibited, as it hints at an architecture
of the future, based on the features of the past, and yet not
bound slavishly to repeat its traditions. The Liverpool Exchange
(Renaissance) is worth noticing for its exceptional style, English
municipal buildings being generally Gothic. This anti-Gothic
taste, which obtains at Liverpool, is probably due to the exist-
ence of St. George's Hall, the foremost classic building of
England. The designs for the Royal Albert Hall and the Albert
Memorial naturally commanded much attention. On the former
building the sagacious disposition of plan and vigorous treatment
which mark the architecture of ancient Rome has been most
successfully combined with the constructive audacity of the
present day. The roof, the new use of old materials, the per-
pendicular tiers of boxes, and the artificial lighting are all
modern; while the elliptical form, the sloping ranges of seats,
the numerous inlets and outlets, and spacious corridors, and the
ample velarium are ancient. The combination has produced
effects more brilliant and striking than any other interior in
England, perhaps in Europe, can offer, and entirely beyond what
was possible to the architects of classic times. Any attempt
to estimate the Albert Memorial in its present incomplete state
would be premature. Church architecture was but sparingly
represented in the Exhibition, many of the leading names being

absent, but there were a good many interesting specimens of
domestic work, among others Crewe Hall, a fine Elizabethan
mansion recently restored by Mr. E. M. Barry after a disastrous
fire. Continental architects were very inadequately represented,
but it is to be hoped that this defect will hereafter be remedied.
There are certain fabrics, says Mr. J. Hungerford Pollen in
his report on Tapestries, Carpets, and Shawls, which may be
classed both as manufactures and as works of fine art. Regard-
ing the number produced, and the mechanical processes by which
they are made, they are manufactures ; but as each of them
possesses a distinct artistic design, they belong to the province
of fine art : such are tapestries, carpets, and shawls. Tapestry
was introduced into Europe from the East, and is said to have
been unknown in Rome till the King of Pergamus, about 130 B.C.,
bequeathed his goods to that city. Under the Empire, tapestry
became a kind of furniture by no means uncommon, and extra-
ordinary accounts of the pictorial tapestries that were made in
Rome are to be read in the poets. In the middle ages of Europe,
when roads were bad, and furniture scarce and of a portable
character, tapestry was of the utmost use. By putting up these
hangings, the bare and comfortless walls of a feudal castle could
in an hour or t:vo be rendered fit for habitation. Many splendid
remains of tapestry, made and kept for churches, to be hung up
on festival days, are preserved in France. The great seat of
the manufacture of woven tapestry was Arras, whence the
name so often found in Shakspeare. The most renowned of
modern tapestry is made in Paris at the State factories of the
Gobelins, which were established in the reign of Louis XIV.
Le Brun, the painter, was the first director, and many of the
earlier designs were from his pencil. At first, the factories
were allowed to execute private orders, but latterly nothing
has been made there except at the expense of the State ; and the
tapestries are either used for palaces or given as State presents.
The work is finished with the completeness of painting, is ex-
ceedingly slow of execution—a workman being able to make
in a year scarcely more than a square metre, or a trifle more than
a square yard. For weaving the Gobelins tapestry, the loom is
upright, and the warp threads are perpendicular. The weaver
stands behind it, and has the exact picture or cartoon to work
from. The cost of the tapestry amounts in some instances to
1601. the square metre. The dyes of the worsted are of extra-
ordinary richness, and are very permanent, being quite fresh at
the end of a century, and even when faded, there are methods of
restoring their brilliancy, provided that the colours remain intact
on the back, which is generally the case.
Other well-known
French tapestry factories are carried on at Aubusson and Beau-
vais. Tapestry was formerly made in England, at Mortlake, and
on the site of Soho-square, but the factories ceased to work at
the beginning of the last century.
Carpets are probably the oldest manufactures of a textile nature
in the whole world. The Babylonians, Ninevites, and Egyptians

hung thrones and state seats with them, and those of classic
Greece and Rome were covered with textures of this kind made
of richly-dyed wool. In the middle ages the Crusaders brought
carpets back from the East, but till comparatively recent years
they were used rather as table or seat-covers than for walking
upon, the floors of houses being generally strewn with rushes.
In portraits of the worthies and beauties of Elizabeth's court,
Turkey carpets or rugs are constantly painted as table-covers in
the background. Oriental carpets may be divided into three
classes, the Turkish, Persian, and Indian. Very fine carpets are
made in Algeria, but the quantity is small, and they are not often
brought to England. The Turkey carpets are exported from Smyrna,
and most of them are made at Oujak in the province of Aidin.
They are worked by hand, each tuft of wool being knitted on the
thread of the warp with the small wooden needles or shuttles
containing the material of the pattern. The designs of the large
carpets are rude and simple, and descend from a remote antiquity.
There is generally a great central pattern disposed diamond-wise ;
large masses, similar to the centre, in the four corners; while
the intervening space is starred or spotted with a simple pattern.
The Turks represent no living animals, and two or three foils or
leaves are the nearest resemblance to a flower. These large
carpets, however, are always rich and harmonious in colour.
The Persians, a sect of Mahomedans whose creed permits the
designing of living creatures, show in their art a more vivid
appreciation of nature, and a more refined and varied system of
colouring than the Turks. The pattern of their carpets is more
broken than the Turkish, and evenly distributed, so as to give
an effect of blending all the colours together. Deep blue, pink,
and apple green are predominant, the ground being generally
dark blue. White, which is rarely seen in old-fashioned Turkey
carpets, is freely used in small lines of separation between the
colours. Most of the Persian carpets imported are small, and
are used as hearth-rugs. They are largely imitated in France ;
but, though the designs are copied from Oriental patterns, the
effect is dull and heavy when compared with the genuine rugs.
By far the most beautiful and characteristic carpets exhibited
this year were those from Masulipatam and other parts of India.
The colours used are a full red, broken by flowers or conventional
leaves in which orange predominates, a cool low blue, a green of
similar gravity of hue, and a soft creamy white. Latterly
English and French dealers have had changes, more or less
important, introduced into these oriental designs, to suit the bad
taste of their customers. This is much to be regretted. Oriental
designers have an instinctive faculty for beautiful colouring, and
that which we term civilisation tends to impair that faculty. Of
European nations, those most old-fashioned, least changed from
the rude ages of the past, retain the greatest enjoyment and
feeling of colour. English carpets began to be established as a
home manufacture in the last century. In 1750 a premium was
given by the Society of Arts for the best imitation of Turkey

carpets, and soon after factories of Brussels and other carpet
fabrics were established at Paddington. It is satisfactory to
observe that although our dealers try to sap the simplicity of the
Orientals, yet that oriental taste is creeping into our modern
carpet designs. Many of these originate with Mr. Owen Jones,
whose admiration and advocacy of oriental decoration have had
so wide an influence.
The most celebrated of the shawls of India are produced in
Cashmere. This fertile valley, close under the spurs of the
Himalayas, produces the finest wool from the Thibet goat, and
its fineness and softness of fibre retains colours of the most
intense and delicate hue. The designs of all Cashmere shawls
are very similar, and consist of combinations of a certain pear-
shaped form, representing a conventional tree. The borders are
made of little panels, under a sort of Arab cusped arch and of the
brightest colours. Each seems made in one of the rude looms of
the country, and darned to its neighbour. These beautiful fabrics
are produced at great cost of time and labour, numbers of hands
being required to complete a single shawl. The French merchants
lately sent out a designer to the Rajah, but the changes he has
effected are decidedly not improvements.
Besides these exquisite productions of the Valley of Cashmere
we have from India woven tissues, some embroidered and some
the work of the loom only, of a splendour unknown to our Euro-
pean weavers. The gold and white, gold and purple, and white
and silver muslins must be ranked for colour, taste, and delicacy
of arrangement, among the artistic triumphs of the Indian loom.
Some in the Indian Court were of a gossamer transparency. They
are used for the dresses of Indian princes and princesses. The
splendours of Turkish costume, partly Syrian, partly Greek, and
partly from the looms of Broussa, near Constantinople, are of the
same kind, though instinctively less elegant than those of India.
The European looms manufacture shawls in imitation of those of
Cashmere, but not the magnificent fabrics just described. In
1784 the manufacture of these shawls was introduced into Nor-
wich, fine Thibet wool being imported for the purpose. At first
the looms were small, and the shawls woven in portions as in
Cashmere, but gradually larger looms were used, and the whole
shawl was made in them. The Paisley manufacture of these
shawls was set up about the same time. After the Egyptian
campaign oriental shawls were manufactured in France, with
certain modifications of pattern not always happy. Levantine
and Albanian scarfs are fine stripe combinations of red, yellow,
green, and blue, some black or white, and bright and well arranged.
All these patterns had an Eastern, probably a Damascene origin.
Some examples of piece-work, woven for furniture purposes
and exhibited in the Royal Albert Hall, deserve notice. Such were
the terry poplins for curtains, exhibited by Messrs. Fry, and
Messrs. Pim Brothers of Dublin. The designs, which are deli-
cate floral patterns, are in relief, obtained by means of the grain
of the silk. Messrs. Clabburn and Co. exhibited a piece of figured

a
tapestry or shawl fabric, in which, in imitation of Indian gold
inlay, flowers and figures of men and animals are disposed over a
black ground, in a silk that shines like gold. The tapestry designs
of Messrs. Gillow, such as we see in sacred pictures of the times
of Dürer, are massive in texture, bold in design, and richly varied
in a simple key of colour. Many of these materials show careful
study of good mediæval design, and the effect of direct copy from,
or adaptation of Indian patterns and colouring, in the case of
shawls and carpets, shows the influence which the East may be
expected hereafter to exercise on European textile fabrics.
Like other artistic productions, lace has participated in the
revival of good taste which has characterised the last few years.
One or two elaborate works have been written on the subject,
and among the series of official reports which are being here
considered, there is one of a very interesting character on Lace
by Mrs. Henry Reeve. Mrs. Reeve begins by pointing out the
artistic value of lace. It softens the harsh lines of dress and
drapery, and produces those half-tints, those delicate lights and
shades which charm the eye in the transition from the gorgeous
colour of the velvet or satin robe to the soft flesh tints of the fair
neck and throat. The Church of Rome has always used the fine
arts to heighten the effect of her magnificent ceremonial, and lace
was used in her services from a very early period. The lawn
napkin which veiled the sacred elements, as well as the coverings
and hangings of the altar table, were all adorned with lace, while
in the dress of a cardinal the harsh contrast which would other-
wise be presented by the white linen tunic worn over the scarlet
robe is obviated by the use of this elegant ornament. A careful
study of the collections of lace at the Hotel Cluny in Paris, and
at the South Kensington Museum in London, has already done
much towards a revival of a correct taste. Portraits also afford
much information, for in almost all the historical or family pic-
tures of the reigns of Mary, Elizabeth, and James I, there are
specimens of lace so accurately painted that the pattern is ready
for working. Some knights and dames seem to have had a special
taste for the point coupé, now called Greek lace, but which is
more accurately to be described as a geometrical design worked
in apertures cut out of a piece of linen. Queen Elizabeth, as her
portentous ruffs and sleeves bear witness, was very fond of this
point coupé. A little lace-trimmed shirt of Charles I was exhi-
bited at South Kensington, and deft indeed must have been the
fingers which worked its ornamentation. The tailors' bills of
Charles II show a nice taste and a fair expenditure in lace, espe-
cially of gold and silver. William of Orange knew the value of
Flemish point, while Queen Anne's Alençon ruffles and lead-gear
are highly prized.
Owing to the improvement of taste caused by the collection of
old lace at the Hotel Cluny, a very high degree of excellence in
point coupé and in point compté has been already reached, while
thousands of hands in the Vosges, as in Paris, bave found em-
ployment in this art, and in its sister art of weaving both black

and white lace on the pillow. These lace fabrics, it may be re-
marked, do not try the eyes of the workers nearly so much as
those which are made with very fine thread, as the points of
Brussels and Alençon.
“ The want of general culture in the customer,” says Mr. Arthur
Helps, “ creates the inferiority of the thing purchased by him.”
Thus, with regard to lace, the customer should not only perceive
a difference between good and bad, but should be able to point
out defects of design, of execution, or of material. If the design
consists of arabesques, the curves should flow on to their actual
termination, and not become stunted or distorted because the
designers selected a pattern too large for the space. In the case
of flowers and foliage more must not be attempted than the
nature of the material and the work admits of treating harmo-
niously. Purchasers should use a magnifying-glass, and count
the number of threads in the square inch, and the number of
twists given by the bobbins in each mesh, as manufacturers do in
classifying fine cambrics and hollands. The material must always
be flaxen thread, smoothly spun, evenly and firmly twisted ; the
size of the thread, of the stitch, of the needle, the weight and
number of the bobbins and of the pins must be carefully adapted
to the pattern, and to the style of the lace.
The specimens of lace sent in to the Exhibition of 1871 were
neither numerous nor of varied kinds, but it is to be hoped that
in future years many more such contributions may be received.
The very high prices obtained by dealers in old lace (200 guineas
for a flounce of Venice point) ought surely to stimulate effort.
Why should not such a prize be as attainable in the 19th as in
the 16th century ? France and Belgium have the monopoly
of the fabrics made with the finest thread, such as those of
Alençon and Brussels. England is apparently satisfied with the
bobbins of Devonshire and Buckinghamshire. After criticising
the specimens sent by England, Ireland (the Irish have for this
work a special talent which only needs further cultivation),
France, and Belgium, Mrs. Reeve concludes by a few suggestions
on the choice of lace. No woman of refined taste, she says,
would use the same lace for trimming her dress and her dressing-
table. While the bridal veil should be of the softest and lightest
fabrics, such as Brussels or Honiton, the heavy Venice point must
be used as a border, not as drapery, and the appropriate back-
ground is silk or velvet. Lastly, the purchaser should consider
whether lace is to float or to fall, whether a deep border of
distinct pattern is to be seen on the dress, or whether, arranged
as fringe the lines of the pattern are lost.
In his Report on Embroidery, Canon Rock points out the
manner in which that decorative art originated. The weavers of
primitive days found that, at both ends of the warp, the threads
thrown across it by the shuttle dropped down, and the ends of
the warp itself became ravelled. To hinder this, each strand in
the warp was knotted, and thus, as those ends soon came to be
untwisted, they formed themselves into a fringe. In time the

threads of the fringe worked by the needle into various shapes,
became a rude form of what is now called lace.
At last so
elaborate and elegant did such fringes become, that the working
of them became a distinct article of industry. The earliest
fringes were always made to consist of two, very often of several
colours, which were set to follow each other in regular succession,
so as to show the various colours of the different threads put
into the weaving of the textile, and thus tell the story of their
own origin. But now fringes are almost always of one single
colour and quite unlike in colour
nd material to the textile
from which they hang. Such a fringe, often ugly.in itself and
unseemly, is a kind of artistic falsehood, belying the real origin
and purport of this adornment. During the greater portion of
the 16th century the place of real lace was supplied in linen
articles of personal dress with slight embroidery, wrought in
coloured thread, black or blue. While the employment of lace-
work has been to hem and border textiles, embroidery has laboured
to spread them over with imagery of every kind. Although this
country was in former times celebrated for its embroidery, the
collection of English needlework in the International Exhibi-
tion was very s nty. Yet the storerooms of old country
mansions abound with fine samples of the old English work,
now miscalled Creek lace, and only last year a fine specimen of
it was turned up in the parish chest of Hesset church, Suffolk,
where it had lain hidden and forgotten for more than three
hundred years. An attentive observer of our modern English
embroideries, as displayed in the Exhibition, cannot help remark-
ing that the designers of those examples needed more skill in
drawing and more knowledge of botany.
To succeed in any
branch of decorative art it is as necessary to be able to draw,
as it is, for all the usages of life, to know how to write. If such
a capacity were more general, we should not have such excres-
cences in leaves and flowers as are often produced.
Mr. Redgrave, the Royal Academician, furnishes a very
valuable Report on the Present State of Design, which sum-
marises conveniently much that has been already advanced
in the foregoing pages. Speaking of carpets, he observes that
the utility of such works would suggest their being quiet
and unobtrusive in their general decoration, even if rich and
full of colour. All violent contrasts, either of form or colour,
should be avoided, and pictorial imitation would seem the
more out of place the more excellent it is, in a work intended
to be trodden under foot. Flat treatment should be observed for
that which covers the ground we tread upon. It is satisfactory to
find that these principles have been extensively adopted in the
manufactures recently exhibited. While most of the carpets are in
good taste, there is hardly one which can be called absolutely
vicious in design ; indeed, in many the faults arise from too
great subserviency to these laws, the want of piquancy, the
want of contrast, and too subdued colour, rather than to the
excess of any of these characteristics.

Pottery is not included by the Commissioners under the Fine
Arts division, although much of it involves design, and is as
much artistic manufacture as shawls or carpets ; Mr. Redgrave's
observations, therefore, on flooring and wall tiles, on domestic
utensils, and on ornamental pottery may be all the more fitly
introduced here. It is obvious that many of the laws which
should govern designs for carpets are equally applicable to floor
tiles. All forms which, either separately or by combination, give
the appearance of inequality of surface, are even more objection
able when introduced into tiled floors than into carpets, from
our sense of the greater rigidity and hardness of the material.
Patterns that are extremely pronounced or strikingly contrasted
are objectionable. The best taste seems to be to cover the general
surface of the floor with tiles whose ground is of a simple
colour, or, if of varied colours, they should be non-contrasting
as to light and dark, so as to give repose. Much depends on
the purpose to which the apartment is devoted.
A large
empty entrance hall calls for more pronounced treatment :
aspect and use must determine whether the floor should
be cool or warm in its colouring, light or dark in its tones.
The decoration of these goods has greatly advanced both in
fancy and variety, within the last few years. On walls,
breadth and quiet must be more desirable even than in the
decoration of floors. A strong expression of lines is always
objectionable, horizontal lines make low rooms seem lower,
strongly expressed diagonals are still more unpleasant.
Turning to architectural pottery, Mr. Redgrave observes that
it is almost impossible to criticise these works except in con-
nection with the structures of which they are to form a part,
since their design is essentially but a detail of the whole idea of
the architect, but he remarks that their ornamentation is, as a
rule, redundant; the modeller, unless a true artist, being tempted
by the pliancy of his material.
It is remarkable how persistent in different countries are the
forms of domestic pottery utensils. In semi-civilised regions the
household vessels of remote ages continue to be produced even to
our own times. The fact is that in objects of domestic utility it
is not easy to obtain novelty. There are but few simple solids of
capacity, and we are restricted even in our use of these by con-
siderations of convenience. However elegant, for example, the
shape of a domestic jug may be, no one cares to use it unless it
can be easily cleaned and comfortably carried. Useful pottery
being thus confined within such narrow bounds, we may look
with some tolerance on the occasional extravagancies displayed in
the designing and decoration of ornamental pottery, where the
artist can do pretty much as he pleases. In the case of objects
of this class, it cannot be said that “ Utility should be considered
before ornamentation," for real utility they have none. They
may take the form of vases, epergnes, candelabras, and fountains,
but they are really merely decorative ornaments, and the more
fantastic and rococo the work, the more some people admire it.

The old Palissy and majolica ware was intended, in the absence
of silver or gold plate, to furnish the buffets of those days,
and give sparkle and colour in the apartment, and similar
advantages are probably conferred by our modern pottery orna-
ments. They serve to hold flowers and boudoir knick-knacks,
they enrich the dinner table, they enliven a room otherwise dull
and sombre. In
any case, a vast amount of good art is expended
on these objects, although sometimes, from want of judgment, much
of it is employed to no beneficial purpose. For example, china
and even faience and stone-ware are so beautiful in their
material, that it is a mistake to load the material by profuse
decoration. When we make a piece of fine pottery look like
gold, or enamel, or hardware, or papier-maché, we rob it of its
natural beauty, and convert it into a sham. Take for example,
the large vases exhibited by Prussia ; if some of the natural
surface of the material had been left undecorated, the contrast
would have been agreeable, the colouring would have seemed
richer, and the vases would have looked less like papier-maché.
Again, two vases exhibited by Minton and Co., the one imitative
of cloisonnée enamel, the other ornamented with bands of imi-
tative damascened work, although great efforts of manufacturing
skill, are examples of misapplied decoration, and cannot compete
with the rich quality of surface of Chinese cloisonnée, or the
inlays of India, Milan, Liège, or Spain. In the fine vases of the
best time of Sèvres, the Bleu du Roi, the Rose du Barry,
and other exquisite surface colours, rarely cover the whole object
but leave the ground of the pâte exposed in various parts. This
rule of not concealing the true material holds good also as to the
gilding of china. Too much gold gives a heavy, clumsy look,
and makes the china look like ormolu, whereas it should be so
added as to be evidently an enrichment of the pottery: A proof
that the material is far too beautiful to be concealed is afforded
by the delight with which we look at china, either wholly white,
or very simply decorated ; at Nankin porcelain, for example,
with its blue ornament, at Satsuma ware, or even our own fine
stone ware.
At the same time it should be clearly understood
that the artistic mistake lies, not in applying colour to pottery,
for this, as in the case of Wedgwood-ware, or French celadon,
may be done with admirable results, but in the imitation of
another material in porcelain or earthenware.
With regard to Furniture, a quotation may be fitly made from
the Report of the Paris Exhibition of 1855. "The primary
elements of style are constructive, and as construction neces-
sarily implies a purpose, utility must have precedence of decora-
tion.” These rules were observed in very few of the costly
pieces of furniture sent for exhibition in 1855. They were
mostly designed as ornamental objects, their use being little
regarded. Since then, a change has taken place ; utility is no
longer neglected, while simple mediæval styles have been revived.
The works in the Exhibition of 1871 may be fairly divided into
two casses : in the first of which, utility takes the lead; in the

second, ornament. Mr. Talbert's sideboard, exhibited by
Gillow and Co., is a good example of the first class. The broad
shelf for dishes, the smaller nooks for condiments, the upper
shelf for silver plate, the cupboards, drawers, and recesses
show it is meant for inse ; yet its decorative details—boxwood
panels, on which are carved groups of fish, flesh, and fowl, are
very agreeable. As an example, on the other hand, of a side-
board, where use is subordinated to ornament, Mr. M. Rogers'
walnut-wood sideboard may be taken, with its richly sculptured
trophy, representing hunting and fishing. In former Exhibi-
tions, this sideboard would have been thought modest and sub-
dued in its decorative features, but it now stands as representa-
tive of the class of ornamental furniture, and enables us to com-
pare the growth of a taste for simplicity of form, and construc-
tive utility in such works.
The series of Official Reports is fitly terminated by Lieut. H. H.
Cole's interesting essay on Reproductions. Collections of the
works of art of different periods have been formed in almost
every European capital. The nucleus of such museums is some-
times provided by the bequest of a collector of curiosities, some-
times by objects of antique pottery or metal work found in the
town or its neighbourhood. In modern times, there is such a
keen competition among connoisseurs for the artistic productions of
former periods, that private collections are frequently, at the death
of the proprietor, scattered in every direction, and in this manner,
some of the most highly-prized specimens of former art become
altogether lost to public view : and, under any circumstances, the
museums of foreign countries cannot be visited without the ex-
pense and labour of travel. But although the originals of such
works cannot be inspected by the home-staying student, they may
be brought, as it were, to his own door, by the means of fac-similes ;
and during the Paris Exhibition of 1867, a systematic plan was
devised, under the auspices of the Prince of Wales and the Princess
Imperial of Germany, for a universal reproduction of works of art
for the benefit of the museums of all countries. This Convention,
which was signed by the chief Princes of Europe, suggests, that
as every country possesses fine historical monuments of art of
its own, which can easily be reproduced by casts, electrotypes,
photographs, and other processes, without the slightest damage
to the originals, each country shall form a Commission, and that
these Commissions shall respectively correspond with
another, and send information of what reproductions each
causes to be made, so that every country, if disposed, may take
advantage of the labours of other nations at a moderate cost.
The Crystal Palace has made extensive use of reproductions
in its varied courts representative of periods and styles of art,
notably in the Egyptian and Alhambra courts, while in the
Italian and English courts are several copies in plaster of famous
sculptures and monuments. But the Crystal Palace is rather
the resort of pleasure-seekers than of students; there are
attractions of a more popular character which throw these fine
one

art fac-similes into the shade, and they are rarely studied oi
appreciated properly. The Arundel Society, too, has done much
towards promoting art knowledge by publishing copies, chiefly
chromo-lithographic and photographic, of the works of ancient
masters. Among these may be especially noted the copy of the
triptych from the hospital of St. John at Bruges, a very minute
painting by Memlinc.
The methods of reproduction may be divided into those which
are purely mechanical, those which are partly mechanical and
partiy artistic, and those which are purely artistic, though the
three divisions frequently run into each other, as, for instance,
where the electrotypist imitates discoloured metals from Pompeii,
or where, in a metal reproduction of a boxwood violin given by
Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Leicester, the colour of the original
wood is precisely imitated.
Piece-moulding in clay is the simplest of all casting processes,
but it has many inconveniences. The results have to undergo
much scraping and touching up, in order to get rid of the seams
produced by the junction of the various moulds, and in some
cases it is considered desirable to leave the seams in the cast
untouched. Gelatine is easier and quicker, more applicable to
large objects, and demands little after-manipulation. The process
is as follows :—The carved surface is thoroughly cleaned and
covered with rolls of modelling clay, the outer surface of the
clay is smoothed, and a plaster covering or wall built against it.
The wall is then removed and the clay taken away ; when the
wall is replaced an interval of the exact thickness of the clay
will exist, and into this interval is poured gelatine. After twelve
hours the gelatine will have obtained the consistency of india-
rubber, and may be peeled off the carved surface. The gelatine
mould is then laid on the wall which supported it in the liquid
state, and a plaster cast or fac-simile is made. Paper moulds
are unsatisfactory, as they seldom produce clean and sharp
casts, but gutta-percha is a convenient material for metal work.
In making an electrotype from a plaster mould, the plaster is
saturated with bees’-wax, and covered with a metallic powder,
on which the copper will deposit itself.
The reproduction of mosaics, which may be regarded as an
operation partly mechanical and partly artistic, is thus accom-
plished. Sheets of damped blotting-paper are applied to the mosaic
to be copied, and, by dabbing these with a long-haired brush,
the precise position of each tessera is obtained upon the blotting-
paper ; when dry, the artist paints upon the indication of the
tessere the tints required, which he copies from the original
mosaic. This coloured paper copy serves as a model for the
mosaicist, who has but to place and fix his own tessere in accord-
ance with the paper mouid, and to exercise his judgment in the
selection of the proper colours.
To the third section of reproductions, namely, those which
depend solely on the artistic ability of the copyist, belong draw-
ings from mosaic and copies of paintings. Among the latter are
a

the interesting series of early Christian works from the cata-
combs of Rome, dating from the second to the seventh centuries.
One of them is remarkable as being the earliest known picture of
the Crucifixion. The originals are rapidly perishing under the
influence of time and damp.
In conclusion, Lieutenant Cole draws a noteworthy distinction
between reproductions and counterfeits. Plaster casts can rarely
be made to serve as counterfeits, and electrotypes can always be
detected; it is, in fact, when the reproduction depends on
artistic and manipulative skill in copying that there is danger of
its being turned to account as a counterfeit. Moreover, repro-
ductions of all kinds, by making would-be collectors more
familiar with styles of art, as well as with fine standard works,
have done much to dispel that ignorance upon which the profes-
sional counterfeiter was wont to foist his wares.
It must, then, be borne in mind that these International Ex-
hibitions, with all their merits, do not, after all, present a
precise image of the condition of art and industry in the
various countries of the world, chiefly because some of the
men who are strongest in their various departments do not
care to exhibit their works. Mediocrity is always ready to
rush in where established reputation hesitates to tread. Thus,
for example, the picture galleries at South Kensington by no
means set forth the actual condition of British pictorial art,
simply because some of the best men were either altogether
unrepresented there, or represented only by some of their less
important works. Nevertheless, if this peculiarity be taken into
consideration, a fair estimate of the state of art in England may
be obtained. First, with regard to pictures. Considering that a
century and a half ago there was scarcely a British-born painter
of any reputation, our progress has been wonderful, nor is
there any falling off during the last ten years. While the
exaggerations of Pre-Raphaelitism have been discarded, the
cardinal truths which the Pre-Raphaelite theory embodied have
been accepted on all sides, and have sent men to the direct study
of Nature who would formerly have been content with feeble con-
ventionalities. We still lack the careful pupilage which prevails on
the Continent, and which there preserves even mediocre artists
from gross errors, but on the other hand there is a freshness and
individuality about English painters which is seldom to be found
in the traditional schools of the Continent. Turning to engraving,
while steel engraving, like miniature painting, has been almost
killed by photography, wood engraving has made marked pro-
gress. The demand for wood-cuts is so enormous that some of
our best artists, who would otherwise make a reputation on
canvas, confine themselves almost entirely to the humbler
medium of box-wood. Rapid production, however, here, as in
other departments, endangers the true interests of art. The
impression from a wood block, hurriedly engraved in sections by
a dozen different hands, cannot excite the same intellectual in-
terest, however great the mechanical dexterity displayed, as the
a

slow and loving labour of a single master; while the system,
now universally adopted, of printing from electrotypes, places
yet another barrier between the spectator and the artist's original
conception. In photography great progress has been made,
not in the production of negatives, but in the power of obtaining
permanent results, and of reproducing copies of standard
paintings and engravings. With regard to other branches of
art, such as those included under the heads of architecture,
pottery, and honsehold decoration, a great advance is discernible.
Architects go further afield, and, no longer content with repro-
ducing the best English art of former times, ransack all Europe
for models. Moreover, iron, glass, and terra-cotta are playing
an increasingly important part in their designs. They would
probably prosecute their endeavours for urban embellishment
more heartily if they could get rid of that pest which disfigures
all great British cities, namely, coal-smoke. A highly-decorated
building in Manchester, Leeds, or Sheffield, becomes in a few years
a dingy ghost of its real self. In carpets and shawls the East
has insensibly imbued us with some of its genuine taste, though
we, on the other hand, are doing our worst to vulgarize the
manufactures of India and Turkey by suggesting so-called im-
provements. In furniture there is a real advance. Slowly, let
us hope surely, the tawdry vulgarities of the ordinary uphol-
sterer are being discarded in favour of sound workmanship and
real convenience. But in all household matters of decoration we
are only learning the A B C of true art. We still disguise the
grain of our common but nevertheless beautiful woods under
coats of paint ; we still hide away our hinges and locks, thereby
rendering them feeble and inefficient, instead of iinitating the
mediæval workers, who displayed them boldly, and made them
ornamental to boot. Altogether, however, there is a genuine
artistic advance in England, and it is visible in a great many
different directions. In the matter of street architecture, for
example, people are no longer contented with the plain brown
brick box, which formerly did duty for a tradesman's house.
Our domestic implements of pottery are less ugly than they used
to be, while the most careless observer cannot fail to remark that
our women dress more tastefully. Formerly, when our lively
neighbours across the Channel brought an Englishwoman on the
stage, they mockingly arrayed her in discordant colours. The
satire would scarcely sting us now, and though there is still much
room for improvement, though outré vagaries of fashion, which
would be shunned in France, are eagerly adopted here, still Art
is winning a gradual victory. People who formerly felt pleased
to tread on a staring flowery carpet, have now learnt that a
less obtrusive design is far more refreshing to the eye. These
improvements are due partly to increased intercourse with more
artistic nations, partly to the efforts of a few persons of genuine
taste and cultivation, but partly to the Exhibitions of recent years.
The dullest visitors to the Exhibition of 1871, probably without
being aware of it, carried away some valuable lessons in taste.

THE PRESENT STATE OF MUSIC IN ENGLAND.
THERE was a time, and that probably within the memory of the
youngest reader of this paper when Music was scarcely regarded
as a subject worthy of intellectual study, when its performance
in public was comparatively rare, when the higher forms of
the art were unknown to the majority of the English nation,
and when the oratorio chorus or the part song was seldom
heard among the masses. Even twenty-five years ago such a
description of the state of music in England could not fairly
have been criticized as overdrawn. The Philharmonic Society was
at work supplying orchestral concerts to the wealthy amateurs
of the day, the Musical Union, under the direction of Mr. John
Ella, had just commenced slowly but surely to gather together
an aristocratic and exclusive party of lovers of chamber music,
which till then had been almost uncultivated, the Sacred
Harmonic Society was impregnating the middle classes with
that taste for Handel's oratorios which in our own day has
culminated in the monster festivals at the Crystal Palace, but,
with these exceptions, there was little external evidence of
any deeply rooted love for the art among the English people,
still less of any desire to make it a branch of popular education.
On this latter point it may be observed that the only really
national school for the education of professional musicians, the
Royal Academy of Music, had at that time been carrying on its
useful work as well as its limited income would allow, for about
twenty-three years, but otherwise there was no opportunity for
the cultivation of native talent or the encouragement of genius.
Music, in fact, was working its way against the tide, and those
of its professors who regarded it from any higher point of view
than as one
ong many other means of gaining a livelihood
found it altogether uphill work. Royal encouragement was
sparingly bestowed; even in 1840 Her Majesty declined to
lend her patronage to a concert of English music which the
leading native professors, disgusted at the undue preference shown
to foreign composers and artists, proposed to give, as it were in
self-defence; and although the Italian Opera was regarded with
favour, it owed its good fortune more to fashion than to any real
love of music. Of musical journals there were one or two in
existence, but they received far from a satisfactory measure of
support; and thus looking in every direction we have ample
evidence that at the date to which we refer music was regarded
as a luxury for the upper ten thousand, ra th as a noble
means of recreation designed by the all-wise Creator to fulfil
certain definite restorative functions in relation to the three-
fold nature of man. Even in the church the art was as little
cultivated as in the home circle or the concert-room. The
cathedrals, it is true, preserved the traditional choral service, to
a great extent, perhaps, because there were endowments for its
performance, which could not by any casuistry be appropriated

without keeping up, in semblance at least, some compliance with
the obvious requirements of the statutes ; but in the ordinary
parish churches of the land the music was, like the prevailing
style of architecture, little calculated either to arrest the un-
spiritual or to elevate the religious. Nor can we feel any
astonishment at such a condition of affairs. Music is essenti-
ally a modern art. Its history in the past is that of a noble
spirit conscious of a high and holy mission, but tied down
by surrounding influences, and a quarter of a century ago it
had only gained a slight hold upon the affections of the general
public. Mendelssohn, indeed, had come amongst us with his
genial influence, and, with the energizing power which a bright
social spirit always exercises, had kindled somewhat of enthusiasm
for his oratorios and- for what he valued far above his own
work-his art; but the fact still remained that music was the
pursuit of the few, not of the many, and that its cultivation even
as a branch of drawing-room aesthetics was very limited.
Now, happily, the scene is totally different.
"Nous avons
changé tout cela,” as Molière says : and although critics, true to
their nature, are still occupying their leisure moments by fighting
over the well-worn question, whether the English are or are not
a musical people, it requires but a very slight amount of observa-
tion to discover that an enormous stride has been taken in the
right direction, and that, in a quarter of a century, progress has
been more rapid than in the whole of the previous hundred
years. The good time has been long in coming, but it has
surely come, and looking at things as they are now and as
they were, we have every reason—not indeed to “rest and be
thankful”—but to take courage and go forward. The present
moment is a critical one in our musical history. The results of
systematic efforts to promote popular education in the other arts
and sciences meet us on every side. Schools of design, with their
drawing and painting classes, have been established in all our
great centres of industry ; prizes and scholarships are held out
as encouragements to the students to advance from grade to grade
in their patient pursuit of the ideal, their endeavour to bring
down to the busy work-a-day world as much of the beautiful as
it is permitted to man to grasp, thus giving a convincing proof
of what can be done by centralization and united effort. And at
this moment, when painting, sculpture, and architecture are well
cared for, when the State lends them the aid of the public purse,
and when private individuals freely advance money for the same
purposes, there are not wanting signs that music which, as a
writer in a recent number of the “Quarterly Review” well puts
it, comes like “a good physician, a tender friend, a gentle
minister of consolation, to all classes, sweeping clear the sky and
showing the blue beyond, making grief bearable and loss tole-
rable,” is at last receiving the attention it deserves. While,
however, this is unquestionably the case, it must also be admitted
that the present state of the art in England is a subject on
which far too little thought is bestowed by the general public,
a

and we therefore propose to furnish a brief outline of the exist-
ing condition of our musical institutions, including our public
entertainments in the opera-house, the theatre, and the concert-
room ; our worship music, as heard in the services of the church
and the chapel ; and lastly, of the present means open to the
various classes of society of educating themselves, either in the
executive branches of the art or in its theory and history.
Having thus considered things of the past and of the present, we
shall be in a position to throw out some few suggestions which
may not be altogether useless at a time when the future of the
art entirely depends on the action taken by those who, in its
several departments, are bound by their position and their
ability to lead the public in the right direction.
And first, taking the highest form of all tonal development,
orchestral music, which in the symphonies of the great masters
seems to have reached the very acme of perfection, we find that
there are no less than three bodies of performers specially de-
voted to the presentation of these masterpieces, the sound-pictures
of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Schumann.
The following table shows the date of the foundation of each
Society, anıl gives the number of performers accorıling to the
effective strength of the bands during the past season :-

These are the only organized orchestras in the metropolis which
can be said to devote themselves to the production of great classical
works. Occasionally, of course, instrumental forces are gathered
together for special performances in the programmes of which we
findasymphony, but the bands directed respectively by Mr.Cusins,
Dr. Wylde, and Mr. Manns alone give their attention as a rule
to this school of composition. To these may be added the
Wandering Minstrels, a body of amateur performers conducted
by the Hon. Seymour Egerton, and the Amateur Orchestral
Guild, an offshoot from the older society, conducted by Dr.
Haking, both of which tread in the same steps as their profes-
sional brethren, and give concerts of considerable artistic
interest in various parts of the United Kingdom. Ever since
its foundation the Philharmonic Society has adhered to the
original principle on which it was founded, and has presented the
subscribers with two symphonies at each concert, while another
feature worthy of note as regards its management is that its affairs
are directed by a council elected annually from among the fore-
most members of the profession. In their more recent policy they
have shown a wise determination to advance with the times, and

the removal from the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square,
the time-honoured locale of the performances, to St. James's
Hall, was an unquestionable act of wisdom, as the handsome but
comparatively small room was not only frequently overcrowded,
but, on account of its limited size, was ill adapted for the modern
orchestra with its powerful percussion instruments. Another notable
improvement has been made at the Society's concerts in the vocal
music, which is now entrusted to artistes of the highest eminence,
whereas in not a few cases in former years, the performance of
the singers was altogether unworthy of association with the
orchestral items in the programmes. During the past season the
directors have been well employed in celebrating the centenary
of Beethoven's birth, in commemoration of which a gold medał
has been struck and presented to those ladies and gentlemen who
have rendered valuable services to the Institution. Dr. Wylde's
“New Philharmonic Society," although ostensibly a corporation
is in reality an organization mainly dependent on and governed
by its conductor, who deserves considerable credit for giving
during the spring of each year very satisfactory performances
of symphonies and other orchestral works, more especially of
those of the later German School, even Liszt’s intricate scores
having been played through with an evident disposition to give
the priest-composer the advantages of a fair hearing.
But while the Philharmonic Society is entitled to stand first
among the musical institutions of London, and indeed, of
England, and the New Philharmonic Society takes the second
place, the real education of the public has been carried on in the
Concert-room attached to the Crystal Palace at Sydenham,
where the Winter Concerts have attained a world-wide celebrity.
Here every Saturday afternoon rich feasts of classical music are
provided, and the execution of the band, owing no less to the
energy of the conductor than to the inestimable benefit of the
daily performances, has become noted for its delicacy and pre-
cision. Although it is unquestionably true, as it is sometimes
reproachfully asserted, that we have no orchestra consisting
solely of native performers—and it is fairly open to question
whether anything would be gained by such a combination—there
is no amateur who does not refer with satisfaction to the
“Sydenham Saturdays” not only as a proof that we can hold our
own against foreign competitors, but as a sign that good music
pays. When the Crystal Palace concerts were first commenced on
the present model the effort was, we believe, purely tentative,
and the financial success of the scheme, necessarily a matter of
importance to a “ Limited Liability Company," with shareholders
to be satisfied, was regarded with no slight anxiety. The result,
however, has exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, and
although in some ways the promises of the original promoters of
Sir Joseph Paxton's beautiful building have been forgotten, and
amusement has become the chief attraction, there is no part of
the undertaking which has reflected more credit upon the respon-
sible officers, or has added more largely to the revenue than the

conduct of the musical arrangements. The programmes of the
twenty-six concerts given from the autumn to the spring are
invariably good, and their effect in the improvement of the
public taste has been very considerable. It should be added
that no slight credit for this satisfactory state of affairs is due
to Mr. Grove, the accomplished manager and secretary, whose
elaborate notes on the programmes have so materially aided the
public in their enjoyment and appreciation.
Descending from the greater to the less, from the combination
of large numbers of instruments to the chamber performances
with a single instrument of its kind for each part, there are two
institutions which call for prominent notice.
Founded.
Director.
The Musical Union
The Monday Popular Concerts ::
1845
1859
Mr. John Ella
Mr. S. Arthur Chappell
Of these the Musical Union first claims our consideration.
This eclectic association was established in 1845, by Mr. John
Ella, then a violinist in the Italian Opera band, under whose
direction it has year after year strengthened its hold upon the
higher classes of society, and by maintaining a certain amount
of exclusiveness in the rules for the admission of members, has
doubtless succeeded far better than it would have done if the
cordon had been removed. Two features have distinguished its
concerts— vocal music has been entirely excluded from the pro-
grammes, except at the director's annual benefit, and the majority
of the performers have been distinguished foreigners, many of
whom would otherwise never have been heard in this country.
The first of these practices has much to recommend it; but on
the second it may be remarked that in a series of concerts which
are so exclusively supported by the English it would be well if
there were a more frequent representation of our native execu-
tants. While, however, Mr. Ella has thus successfully and
consistently catered for the “upper ten,”—and owing to the
cost of the subscription, and the hour at which the per-
formances are given (three o'clock in the afternoon) none but
those who have both time and money at their command, can
enjoy his matinées—the taste of the middle classes for the
most refined specimens of composition has not been neglected,
and what has been done at Sydenham for orchestral music
has been done for chamber music, with equally satisfactory
results, at St. James's Hall, by Mr. Arthur Charpell. In the
year 1859, the Monday Popular Concerts were established with
a string quartet party, a pianist, and one or two vocalists to
supply the programme, in which, from that day to this, the
classical, as distinguished from the miscellaneous on the one hand,
and the merely frivolous or sensational on the other, has held
its sway, even the works of modern writers in the same school,
not being admitted as frequently as their admirers could desire,

or, perhaps, as their merits really deserve. But while Mr. Chap-
pell has thus adhered conscientiously to the standard which he
formed for himself twelve years ago, it is pleasant to know that
he has never had cause to regret the high aims and the artistic
purity of his scheme. Week after week, and often twice a week
--for the Saturday Popular Concerts are but an offshoot of the
parent stem-audiences which fill every available seat are
gathered together in St. James's Hall, and if the sight of a great
orator holding spell-bound an immense auditory in the Senate
or the church is impressive, far more noble is the scene here
presented, when one man or woman, or a little party of execu-
tants solely devoting themselves to the unfolding of the great
design of a master whom they all revere, keep wrapt in sympa-
thetic silence a vast crowd of listeners eagerly drinking in the
pure tones which, as it has been well said “enjoy the glorious
disability of expressing a single vicious idea or of inspiring a
single corrupt thought.” Of the music heard at these concerts it
would be superfluous to speak, but on the good old principle of
place aux dames a line may fairly be given to record the obliga-
tions which lovers of pianoforte music owe to Mdme. Arabella
Goddard, our native pianiste, for her zealous production of
masterpiece after masterpiece, including not a few works by the
minor classics which had been too long neglected, and were
comparatively unknown until she played them in public.
The great Hungarian violinist, Joachim, still deservedly holds
the post of first violin at nearly all Mr. Chappell's concerts, and
it must be admitted that by maintaining them with all their
varied excellence the director has conferred a benefit on the
country which anywhere else but in England would have
received a direct public recognition. This, however, is perhaps
still to come in a day when art will assert her rights, and when
an order of merit will be established to reward those who have
devoted themselves to the elevation of the minds of their fellow
citizens.
Leaving purely instrumental music, and turning to that more
popular class of composition where band and choir are united,
the great choral bodies for which England has obtained a
deservedly high reputation, call for detailed notice. The most
important of these are :-

steadily successful, and its oratorio performances, directed by Sir
Michael Costa, are the finest to be heard in this country. At
the same time it may be questioned whether the policy of the
directors has not been too conservative, and whether the feeling
of security which they enjoy from the knowledge that a repe-
tition of the popular compositions of Handel and Mendelssohn
always yields satisfactory pecuniary returns has not acted
prejudicially, and hindered the production of new or unknown
works. Of late, however, there have been signs of a disposition
to move onwards in this respect, and it is to be hoped that
during the ensuing season there will be a still further departure
from the beaten track. Neither performers nor audiences are
the better for a constant performance of the same music year
after year, and while hard work is involved in the search for
“ fresh fields and pastures new," such enterprise always carries
with it its own reward. Although we have included Mr. Henry
Leslie's choir in the same category with the societies engaged in
the performance of oratorios and masses, owing to the fact that
it is frequently heard in works which have orchestral accom-
paniments, its specialty is the execution of the unaccompanied
choral music of the best compos ancient and modern.
Whether it is in one of Palestrina's ancient works, or in such
motetts as those of Samuel Wesley ; whether the programme be
formed from the glee and madrigal of bye-gone days, or the
modern part-song, with its delicate effects and brilliant tone
colouring, the singing of the choir is alike superb, and nothing
superior to it can be heard in this or any other country. The
performers are a mixed body of professional and amateur singers,
who neither pay a subscription nor receive any remuneration for
their services. Excellence of voice, and regular attendance are
the only conditions of entry, although the limited number of the
choir renders the membership somewhat difficult of attainment,
but even these restrictions would avail nothing without the firm
discipline of the conductor who permits no deflection from his
standard of perfection. The National Choral Society, which has
now completed the tenth year of its existence, works on a dif-
ferent system, the members paying an annual subscription. Its
choir ranks decidedly below the others we have mentioned, and
although its performances in past years have been of a fairly
satisfactory nature as regards the chorus, the orchestral arrange-
ments have been decidedly defective. The well-known oratorios
form the staple of the programmes. Mr. Barnby's choir, which
has now ceded its distinctive title in favour of the name given to
the performances directed by the conductor, viz., “The Oratorio
Concerts," was formed in 1867. Mr. Barnby, who is as well known
in the church as in the concert-room, the choral services at St.
Andrew's, Wells-street, where he was for many years organist and
choir-master, being deservedly celebrated, has in a short time
obtained a striking success with his performances, although he is
infinitely more at home as a choir-master than as chef d'orchestre.
The new works which he has produced, and still more notably

the performance of Handel's Jephtha, Bach's Passion-Music, and
Beethoven's Mass in D, have gained for him the hearty sym-
pathy of the public who love music for its own sake, and it may
truly be said that he deserves his reputation. While his pro-
ceedings have been characterized by boldness, he has spared no
pains to secure a careful and conscientious execution of the
grand works he has chosen, and the members of his choir have
thus been compelled to submit to an amount of active drilling
which is as highly creditable to them as it is to their conductor.
During the ensuing season the concerts will be given at
Exeter Hall, the choir being enlarged to 500 voices, and
the orchestra strengthened in proportion. Of the Handel
Festival Choir, which has this year sung at the triennial
meeting at Sydenham, it is sufficient to say that it furnishes a
direct evidence of the energy which has been displayed of late
years in the matter of musical performance. Where such a vast
body of singers is gathered together there must of necessity be
some unevenness of execution and occasional marks of coarseness
which frequent rehearsals alone can tone down, but when it is
remembered that many of the most difficult choruses at these
monster music meetings are sung without åny previous combined
rehearsal of the provincial and metropolitan contingents, and in
some cases without any preliminary practice at all, it is a suffi-
cient proof of the general improvement in sight-singing which
has taken place throughout the country, an improvement due
quite as much to the labours of the Tonic Sol Faists as to the
exertions of those who still adhere to what is commonly termed
the Old Notation. The same progress has been noticeable at the
provincial festivals at Gloucester, Worcester, Hereford, Birming-
ham, and Norwich, which still maintain their interest by afford-
ing an opportunity for the production of new works by native
and continental writers, many of the most important of the
recent contributions to our stores of choral music, sacred and
secular, having been given at these time-honoured festivals.
Of opera in England it must be admitted with regret that there
is still but little prospect of the formation of a national school
either of composers or performers. The ill-fated company directed
by Miss Louisa Pyne and Mr. William Harrison served to bring
forward music full of beauty by Balfe, Wallace, and other com-
posers, but like the Royal English Opera Company which took its
place, it failed from a lack of public support. Explain the
anomaly how we may, the fact remains that English writers of
the present day seem unable to compose operas of the “grand”
type in sufficient number to supply a national Opera House with
an attractive succession of novelties, and thus we find that nearly
every undertaking established to supply such performances dege-
nerates into a company for the presentation of Italian or French
works of the lighter class in an English dress. Some minor works
by Mr. Sullivan and other composers, partaking of the operetta,
style and cast in a light and popular form, are meeting with
greater acceptance, and is from this source that we must look

for the ultimate rising of a school of native operatic composers, if
such a desirable consummation is ever to be reached. Italian
opera, on the other hand, always supported by the rank and
fashion of society, and the only musical institution in England
which receives unasked a fair share of Royal patronage, is still
supplied at rival houses, the attempted coalition between Messrs.
Gye and Mapleson having resulted in an ignominious failure from
an artistic point of view. The great vice of the system in the
present day is the practice of sacrificing everything to the demands
of the chief artistes, who, when they once become popular fa-
vourites, receive salaries altogether out of proportion to the
services they render. Such a practice must, even with the large
resources of our operatic entrepeneurs, eventually involve them in
bankruptcy, or lead to the neglect of the other accessories which
are so important on the lyric stage, and during the past season
there were proofs that the exorbitant charges of the prima
donna necessitated a reduction of expenditure in other depart-
ments which told disadvantageously on the ensemble. Added to
this, the undue preference shown to individual artistes leads
them to overtax their powers by singing more frequently than
they ought when they are in their prime, or else induces them to
perform in public, as in the case of Madame Grisi and Signor
Mario, when their efforts to overcome the loss of physical strength
are as painful to the thoughtful among the audience as to the
artistes themselves. Still more unsatisfactory is the encourage-
ment given by the habitués of some of the West-end theatres to the
performances of the lightest school of French operas, and the abso-
lute favour shown to performers who in their way are even more
offensive than the Music-hall singers who contribute so largely
to the demoralisation of the lower classes of society. It is, we
fear, only too true, as Mr. Tom Taylor asserts in his recent pam-
phlet on the Theatre in England, that the taste of the nation
has deteriorated as far as the drama is concerned, and that the
stage bas fallen from the high estate which once gave it a claim to
rank next to the pulpit as an agent in the inculcation of sound
principles ; but we question whether, judging from the increasing
popularity of Offenbach's operas, which are deemed comparatively
flat by their admirers without a soupçon of indecency among the
actors and actresses, the same charge may not be brought against
the lyric stage. On the whole, however, we are inclined to agree
with Mr. Taylor that the taste of the gallery and the pit is still
sound, and that the loss of tone is found in the higher ranks, where
the thinly veiled immoralities of the sensational novel and the
lax habits of Belgravian society are unfortunately the fashion.
Thus it is the duty of all who are interested in the progress of
music in England to discourage the prevailing taste, not because
the music in itself is baneful, but because by its very lack of depth
it requires the eccentricities, as they are politely termed, of persons
of the Schneider type, to draw an audience to listen to it. That
peers and peeresses, and even princes and princesses, should,
night after night, have crowded the theatre where such a pro-

gramme was provided is enough to prove that there is ground for
apprehension, and the danger we have referred to is especially to
be guarded against at a time when the love of the art is becoming
so general. Fashion is always a powerful agent in moulding the
public taste, and as lessees naturally prefer to produce what
pays rather than to play Shakespeare or Mozart to empty houses,
it is a point which cannot safely be neglected. Up to the present
time, however, the chief operatic managers have reinained proof
against the temptation thus to lower their standard, and it
is to be hoped that they will never be led to depart from it, for
the history of opera as well as of every other branch of the art in
this country emphatically proves that it is only the good and true
which really stands the test of time.
Among the miscellaneous entertainments obtaining the largest
amount of popularity are the so-called Ballad Concerts, the pro-
grammes of which serve to bring before the music-buying public
the new drawing-room songs issued by the publishers who, as a
rule, manage the performances. Out of them has grown the
vicious “ royalty” system, as it is termed, by which a public
vocalist undertakes for a certain sum to sing a new ballad, often
of the most worthless description, and thus to secure for it an
assured sale of a large number of copies purchased by those who
sing what their favourite songsters sing, without regard to the
merits of the music or the character of the words. The latter are
often of the most inane description, sufficient, in fact, to create a
feeling of disgust if they were really listened to, but as in general
they are merely sung amid the hum of after-dinner conver-
sations, they may, perhaps, be excused on the ground that they
possess the negative virtue, not altogether without its value in
the present day, of being free from vice. Here and there among
these compositions we find a song describing the home scenes which
are so dear to the Englishman, and setting before him, like one of
Faed's pictures, an episode of domestic life, which always possesses
its own peculiar charm, but in too many cases they are utterly
worthless
, the words being at times even ungrammatical, and
nearly always without continuity, and the music a mere succes-
sion of chords as meaningless as the tum-tum of the uneducated
savage. Other concerts, however, among those provided by indi-
vidual artistes or managers, possess far higher claims, and spe-
cially the recitals by Madame Arabella Goddard, Madame Schu-
mann, and Mr. Charles Hallé. The programmes in these cases
have a direct educational value, and performers on the pianoforte
can adopt no better method of acquainting themselves with the
resources of their favourite instrument, or of learning to appre-
ciate the stores of music specially written for it, than by a regular
attendance at these performances. Up to the present time a dis-
tinctive character has been imparted to the programmes of each
of these eminent artistes : Mr. Charles Hallé choosing the works
of the greatest masters, and generally devoting himself to one
author during the season, as in his performance of Beethoven's
sonatas; Madame Arabella Goddard illustrating the Dii minores,

and diving into the portfolios of Dussek, Clementi, and Cramer ;
while Madame Schumann has given us, in her own unequalled
manner, a choice selection from the modern school and her hus-
band's works in particular.
In glancing at the more immediate opportunities afforded for
obtaining musical education it is natural that our thoughts
should turn at once to the Universities, the great centres of
training for those who are able, on the conclusion of school life,
to carry on their studies to maturity. Here, however, we are
doomed to disappointment. The university professorships of
music, instead of providing education in the art only serve to
test its progress, as the lectures given are of the most cursory
description, and the real work of the occupant of the music
chair lies in the examination for the degrees of bachelor and
doctor of music which, unlike the degrees in arts, laws, or
divinity, are granted on the passing of the necessary examina-
tions without residence. The following table will show the date
of the foundation of the professorships, with the names of the
professors :-

At the English Universities and at Dublin terminal lectures
are delivered, but no systematic instruction is given either in the
theory or practice of music, and the lectures are usually devoted
to the historical branches of the subject. At Edinburgh the case
is entirely reversed. No degrees are granted, and the Professor,
Dr. Oakeley, devotes his time to the delivery of courses of lec-
tures and to recitals on the organ, on which he is an able performer.
As a further means of educating the students and the public
who are admitted to the organ concerts the Professor adopts the
very useful practice of interspersing the programmes with his-
torical notes and critical remarks, thus enabling his audience to
appreciate the varied beauties of the music. At the Andersonian
University at Glasgow the lectureship founded by the munifi-
cence of a devoted amateur, Mr. William Euing, is doing a good
work in the education of the townspeople, evening lectures being
combined with graduated classes for elementary and advanced
pupils ; in fact, as far as imparting instruction is concerned, the
youngest of the universities is doing by far the most important
work, and the success of the students at the Society of Arts’
examination is a proof of the thorough character of the instruc-
tion they receive. It is, of course, perfectly true that the
endowments of Oxford and Cambridge are insufficient to enable

a professor to reside during term, or to devote much time to his
work, but this seems to us to be a conclusive argument in favour
of an alteration in the present system, and we can scarcely
believe that if a proposition were made in Convocation for the
establishment of a musical lectureship there would be any
difficulty in obtaining the needful sum from the University
exchequer. That there would be ample work for a well-qualified
man in the delivery of lectures and the conduct of choral classes
cannot be doubted by any one who is acquainted with the under-
graduates, among whom music is universally popular and ex-
tensively cultivated, even in the face of existing discouragements,
in addition to which it is obvious that the provision of a com-
plete system of instruction would materially add to the value of
the degrees, the examinations for which might still be conducted
by the professors and their present assistants.
At Dublin, the following are the musical arrangements in the
University.
Degrees in music are granted under the Charter of Charles I,
of which a part runs thus:-
“Ut studiosi in Eodem Collegio Sanctæet individuæ Trinitatis
Elizabethæ Reginæ juxta Dublin," (the city did not then reach to
the College walls, which are now on all sides surrounded by it),
' libertatem et facultatem habeant gradus tum Baccallaureatus-
Magisterii, et Doctoratus, juxta tempus idoneum in omnibus
artibus et facultatibus obtinerdi."
The University authorities have always liberally maintained
the choral service, and kept a large organ in their chapel within
the walls. In this chapel the most eminent of the musicians
attached to the two cathedrals of Dublin-St. Patrick's and Christ
Church-have also been engaged. Six choral scholarships were
founded some years ago ; students obtain them after an examina-
tion; they then assist in the chapel choir, and in consequence of
doing so, have one-half their college fees remitted. The well-
known madrigal writer, Thomas Bateson, who was organist and
master of the children of Christ Church in 1618, is, upon the
authority of Sir John Hawkins and of Dr. Rimbault, said to have
been Mus
. B. of the Dublin University ; on the title of his second
set of madrigals he is called “ Organist and master of the boys of
the cathedral of the Blessed Trinity (Christ Church) and Bachelor
in Music, Dublin.” From the imperfect state of the records
it cannot be ascertained who was Professor of the Faculty of
Music in the 17th century, or whether there was any occupant of
the chair. It is believed that the degrees were conferred by the
whole College in Comitia (“Commencements ') assembled, and by
diploma.
The earliest Professor of whom record is preserved, was the well-
known Irish musician, the Earl of Mornington, who was appointed
in July, 1764, and held the office for ten years, when he resigned.
Degrees seem to have been afterwards conferred by diploma ; the
form called “the Grace of the house” being first sought for
publicly ; that is, the Proctor brought forward, before the whole

"
a
senate, the name of the candidate, and if none objected to it, the
degree was granted in due course, a proceeding not unlike the
publishing of the banns of marriage. Very recently, an un-
popular or unsuitable person has been refused this ** Grace of
the house," and in consequence no degree was conferred upon
him. It is by no means an idle form.
Musical lectures (open to the public) are given in the College
Halls.
When the present Professor of Music was elected, in 1861, he
determined not only that the examination for music should be
bonâ fide, but also that all musical graduates should possess the
preliminary education of gentlemen, and no one has since
passed the examination who has not been thoroughly educated
both as a gentleman and a musician. In no way can music more
definitely assert her place than in putting forward men of fair
general (no less than musical) information ; yet this preliminary
education is peculiar to the Dublin University.
Trinity College also possesses a Choral Society composed of
students, or those who have been students of the University,
founded in 1837, with the Provost and other college digni-
taries for patrons, vice-presidents, &c. The weekly practices
held within the College walls are conducted by Dr. Stewart, the
Professor of Music, who also directs the orchestra at the public
concerts, of which there were five given last year. The music
consisted of such works as “Lauda Žion,” (Mendelssohn); “Eli,”
(Sir M. Costa); “Mount of Olives,” (Beethoven); “Die Zau-
berflote,” (Mozart), &c. Of late years examinations for women
have been established ; lady-amateurs also assist the students
at the rehearsals and concerts. Music, it will thus be seen, is prac-
tised with extreme assiduity within the University precincts.
We append a table of the fees now charged to students for
the degrees in music at the three Universities :-

Mus. Doc.
Oxford
Cambridge
Dublin
£10
From £4 48. to £10
£11 158.
£20
From £3 to £12
£22
To these sums, which vary slightly at the various colleges
must be added some small fees payable on entrance.
At London and Durham there is no Musical Professor and no
degrees in the faculty are granted, and in the case of the former
University this is specially to be regretted. If a Music Chair
uld be founded, and the Royal Academy could be affiliated to
the University, students might proceed from the training school
to the Board of Examiners, and take their degrees on the system
now adopted by the alumni of King's College. In the metropolis,
the music lectures at Gresham College are delivered during the legal
terms by Dr. Wylde, who receives an annual stipend of 1001., but it
is much to be wished that classes in music could be added to the

lectures, and that thus this old foundation might become of the
same practical value to London that the Euing lectureship is to
Glasgow. At the London Institution in Finsbury-square, the
council, exercising the power conferred on them by Royal
Charter, have established a musical professorship, to which during
the past year Mr. John Ella, the director of the Musical Union,
has been appointed. He will, we believe, commence his labours
in the winter, and from the interest excited by his previous
lectures there can be little doubt of the success of the scheme.
Of schools for the education of professional musicians, there are
two in the metropolis : the first and most important being the
Royal Academy of Music, already referred to; and the second,
a semi-private institution, entitled the London Academy of
Music, conducted by Dr Wylde. The Royal Academy, which
was established in 1822, and was incorporated by Royal Charter
in 1830, receives the small annual subsidy of 500%. from the
State by vote of the House of Commons, and thus it is largely
dependent for its existence upon public subscriptions and the
students' payments. It is in fact the nearest approach we possess
to a national music school, but its revenues are so small that
it cannot do the work which the professors are anxious to under-
take, although it supplies gratuitous education in cases where
the highest excellence and natural ability are manifested. The
annual course of instruction is divided into three terms, the fees
for which amount to 33 or 21 guineas in the senior or junior
department respectively, with an entrance fee of 31. ; and as, in
addition to this, the students have to pay for their own board
and lodging, it is obvious that attendance at the Academy
entails a considerable outlay. There are two free scholarships,
and two partly free. At the London Academy, the fees amount
to £15 158. per annum. Another institution recently established,
the College of Organists, although it does not at present attempt
to provide educational advantages, except in the way of lectures
to the fellows, is calculated to do a good and useful work amoug
a large and deserving body of men ; and the energy displayed by
Mr. Limpus and the Council in its formation and management
is worthy of high praise. While, however, we possess these three
bodies in working order, it will be obvious that the advantages en-
joyed on the continent, where the conservatoires or music schools
are State institutions, are not shared by the English, inasmuch as
our only really national academy is so crippled by want of funds
that its continued existence has more than once been imperilled.
Under its present principal, Sir W. S. Bennett, the institution
has gained ground, and the students concerts, conducted by
Mr. John Hullah, have given proofs of the improved system
adopted in the establishment. When, therefore, we reflect on
the vast sums granted year by year for far less worthy objects,
it is almost impossible to exonerate the Government from a
charge of wilful neglect in not contributing more largely towards
the promotion of an institution so essentially calculated to aid in
the elevation of the people. When it is remembered that the

majority of the most able teachers of music throughout the
country have been educated at the Academy, and that many of
our most eminent native artistes were trained within its walls,
there is ample ground for asserting that it deserves support, and
we believe the facts of the case only require to be generally
known in order to enlist public interest and sympathy. The
Irish Academy of Music is entirely supported by the pupils'
fees and public subscriptions and donations, the Cabinet having
persistently refused to grant it any aid. Indirectly, the Society
of Arts has aided in promoting musical education by establishing
examinations in music conducted by Mr. John Hullah and
Mr. G. A. Macfarren, and the large number of candidates at
each examination, especially from among the Tonic Solfaists, gives
a clear proof that the privilege has been appreciated. To the
Rev. John Curwen, whose labours in the promotion of popular
musical education on the Tonic Sol-Fa system have been so
successful, high praise is due, and whatever opinion may be held
by the reader as to the relative merits of the old and new nota-
tions it cannot be denied that a large proportion of the sight
singers of the present day have to thank these musical neologians
for the precious capacity which they possess, and which has so
largely increased the range of their daily pleasures. The decision
of the Committee of Council on Education to encourage musical
education in primary schools is also to be noticed as an evidence
of what may be accomplished by steady perseverence, although
they have this year withdrawn it from the list of extra subjects
for which the national schoolmasters could obtain grants. In
the same connection, the inclusion of sight-singing in the scheme
of the London School Board is also to be chronicled as a proof of
the change of public opinion on the subject.
Looking lastly at what we have for the sake of convenience
termed “Worship Music we have strong grounds for satisfac-
tion not only in the striking progress made of late years but in
the prospects for the future. On all sides a frequent use of
music in the services at our churches and chapels is insisted on
as a necessary aid to devotion in places where formerly it was
regarded with pious horror, and not only so, but the organ itself
is making its notes heard in the kirks north of the Tweed, while
scarcely a chapel of any denomination is now opened in England
without an organ or harmonium. To this result the establish-
ment of choral unions with superintending choir-masters to drill
the choirs in various parts of the country has greatly contributed,
and it is also noteworthy that music is far more popular among
the younger clergy than it was among their ancestors, a fact of no
slight importance, inasmuch as their influence either to aid or
retard the progress of musical education among the people is very
considerable. In former days the cloistered priests were the
chief conservators of art and literature, and now that times have
changed and we look for the successors of the monks in the
rectories and vicarages of the land we may fairly appeal to them
to throw open their schools for the holding of classes composed

of all sections of their parishioners irrespective of creed, as by
this means they may directly aid in the spread of a knowledge
of and love for the art. Another striking proof of the growth
of a taste for music among every body of religionists is fur-
nished by the large number of tune books which have been
issued from the press during the past ten years, all tending more
or less to encourage congregational singing. In the same direc-
tion, too, we may note the increase of cheap musical literature, the
chief oratorios being now on sale for a shilling, and large num-
bers of excellent part songs at a penny each, or, in the case of
children's music, even at a halfpenny.. The following table will
show the musical journals at present in existence, with the date
of issue of their first numbers :-
Musical World, January 5, 1836.
Musical Times, June 1, 1844.
Musical Standard, Aug. 2, 1862.
Choir, July 18, 1863.
Orchestra, October 3, 1863.
Musical Record, Novemie: 1, 1870.
Of these journals the “Musical Times” and “ Musical Record”
are published every month, the others being weekly papers.
Three out of the six contain a sheet of music in addition to the
ordinary literary matter, and as a whole they may be said to
compare very favourably with the French and American serials,
although they are excelled in some cases by the more elaborate
musical criticism of the German press.
Having thus considered the present state of the chief musical
institutions in England as contrasted with the condition of affairs
existing a quarter of a century ago, we will now point out
briefly some of the most important conditions essential to future
progress. And in the first place it seems to be impossible that
any really effective system of popular musical education can be
provided without State aid. To this fact the experience of the
managers of the Royal Academy of Music clearly points. They
have lost no opportunity of obtaining funds from private sources,
but have found it to be utterly impossible adequately to provide
for the carrying on of their work by such means. That the
country would object to a liberal grant for the purpose we can
scarcely believe when we note the readiness with which large
sums are voted for the addition of pictures to our national col-
lections, and the maintenance of the Science and Art Departments
at South Kensington, and we trust that ere long some member of
the government will take the matter in hand. We have now a
Minister of Education, and if as in Paris the promotion of the
fine arts were added to his duties there would be some prospect
of seeing the work commenced. At present, what is
business is no one's, and thus it comes to pass that while artistes
receive enormous incomes, while two Italian Opera-houses are open
simultaneously, and while every form of concert is extensively
patronized, the only means of raising up a native school of com;
posers, teachers, and executants is neglected. This should
not be, and the sooner the disgrace is removed from us the better.
every one's

Such a national school as we desire to see established might fitly
be formed out of the present Royal Academy, which with an en-
larged income and an extended scheme of operations would
be well able to undertake the work. Free education ought
to be provided for a considerable number of pupils, inasmuch
as experience proves that some of the most gifted musicians
- are to be found among the lower ranks of society, and the fees
payable by the other students ought to be very much lower than
those now charged, while it would also be desirable to add a general
educational establishment to the institution. In connection with
it evening classes might be formed, and an orchestra might
be permanently kept up for the trial of new works, thus offering
to English composers an advantage the want of which has too
long acted as a discouragement. Another important question is
the
best means of providing elementary training for the people,
and especially the young in our large towns. The teaching of
music in the parochial schools will do much to promote this result
if, as we hope will be the case, sight-singing and not singing by
ear is insisted on : but the adults and the young men and women
still remain to be provided for. One point is very plain, that
if musical education becomes general, there will in future be
a better supply of competent teachers for the training of the
children, and if the numerous school-rooms controlled by the
local boards are made available for evening instruction, much
may be done.
Classes on the old notation and on the Tonic
Sol-Fa system might be conducted on different evenings, and
in nearly every case they would be found to be self-sup-
porting, especially if concerts were given at intervals by the
pupils. But while the poor are cared for, the higher classes
must not be neglected. Music must be efficiently taught in all
our large public and middle-class schools for boys; and in girls'
schools, where the pianoforte has always formed a subject of in-
struction, the system must be altered materially from that
hitherto adopted. In the place of the dull mechanical drudgery
which the pupil now passes through and which can only render
her tolerably proficient as far as the mere digital exercise on the
keyboard is concerned, music must be taught as other subjects
are taught, and “the reason why” must form an element in
the teaching In a word, the art and not the instrument
must form the basis of the lesson, and the pupil in learning to
play must also learn the language as well as the mere notes.
The every-day conversation in our drawing rooms, and the style
of music there supplied, prove that there is an immediate need
of reform in this respect, and one of the most practical
methods of imparting a knowledge of first principles is to bring
up every child in the practice of sight-singing, as when this is satis-
factorily and soundly taught, everything else will follow. Much
also may be done by our composers, our concert-givers, and our
artistes. Let them remember that they owe a duty to art as
well as to their pockets, and as a good painter would decline to
place his name on a carelessly executed picture which would

tarnish his reputation, so let the song-writers, the conductors, and
the vocalists remember that they have a very important duty to
fulfil, and that they can to a great extent guide the public taste.
It may be true, as we believe it is, that Englishmen lack in many
cases that innate power of distinguishing the true from the false
in music, which is such a striking characteristic of the Germans;
but there is always a tendency to ascribe to natural inferiority
that which ought more truly to be laid at the door of a defective
system of training. Thoroughly convinced are we that a deep
love for the art exists among the English people, and we look
forward with hope to the day when it will be generally culti-
vated by rich and poor. Its influence can only be for good, its
practice can only tend to make men better Christians and better
subjects, and he who wishes well to his country can adopt no
surer method of promoting her true welfare than by aiding to
the utmost of his power in this truly national work.
CHARLES MACKESON.
INDUSTRIAL RESULTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY.
ALThough the now familiar art of Photography may, to some
extent, be regarded as still in its infancy, its practical influence in
the realms of manufacturing industry has proved the reverse of
insignificant. Forty years ago, the process of taking pictures by
means of the sun's rays was regarded as little better than a
beautiful scientific experiment, too costly and difficult to possess
any chance of being frequently repeated. At the present time
it forms the regular occupation of some thousands of individuals,
not only in this country, but also on the continent, in the United
States, in Canada, and in Australia ; besides affording the means
of employment to yet larger numbers engaged in the many branches
of manufacturing industry, which the increasing practical appli-
cations of photography are continually calling into active exist-
It has been estimated that at the present moment the
photographic art, either directly or indirectly, provides employ-
ment for at least half a million persons in various parts of the
world. There are no means of verifying the correctness of this
estimate, but when we reflect on the enormous extent to which
photography is practised in the United States alone, where every
town has its photographic studio, not to mention those of the
large cities, the calculation does not seem at all excessive.
The real industrial value of photography dates from the dis-
covery of the collodion process in 1850. This formed the actual
starting point of the art. It rendered the taking of permanent
pictures comparatively easy and cheap, and caused the Daguerreo-
type and Talbotype to become things of the past. In the
daguerreotype process, the portraits were taken upon plates of
silver, or copper coated with silver. Despite their costly character
a very considerable trade arose out of the demand for these
ence.

67
plates, and large numbers of persons were employed in silvering
the surface of the copper, a process requiring great delicacy
and care.
But the leaden, death-like hue, peculiar to Daguerreo-
type portraits, a defect which not even the employment of
colours could wholly remove, caused a greater preference to be
shown to the Talbotype, in which paper was used instead of silver.
Moreover, while in the case of the Daguerreotype process the
portraits were reversed, as in a looking-glass, those taken by
Mr. Fox Talbot's method showed the object represented as it
really appeared to the eye. This was effected by means of the
picture being taken upon
waxed paper, which showed the lights
and shadows reversed. The picture thus obtained was called a
negative. The waxed paper, or negative, was then laid upon
another piece of prepared paper, and exposed to the action of
light, which, passing through the transparent portions of the
picture, caused them to become darkened on the second paper,
the opaque portions remaining untouched. The new picture
thus produced represented the lights and shadows as in nature,
and was called a positive. The use of waxed paper for taking
negatives has now become almost entirely superseded by the
employment of glass, the surface of which is prepared especially
for the purpose by one of the numerous existing modifications of
the albumen, or collodion processes, according to the tastes or
requirements of the photographer.
În the earlier sun-pictures the want of permanency was fre-
quently apparent. Not only were they costly, but they were no
sooner taken than they began to fade. This was particularly
noticeable in pictures produced by the Daguerreotype process,
which frequently disappeared from the surface of the silvered plate,
despite every precaution to protect it from injury. Nor were the
Talbotype pictures much more successful. No reliance could be
placed upon their stability. They might be almost perfect as
pictures, but their permanency was always doubtful. They
might endure for months, perhaps only for days ; but ultimately
they were certain to fade. To overcome this serious obstacle
long formed the great object of Mr. Fox Talbot and his fellow-
labourers in the new art. The defect arose from the instability
of the metallic salts employed, as explained by an experienced
writer in the “Popular Science Review," who informs us that :-
“The blacks of photographic prints on ordinary unsized paper
consist of silver. To aid in the proper fixing of a photograph, or
destroying its future sensitiveness to light, hyposulphate of soda
in solution is employed. The action of this salt on the silver in
the pores of the paper is of an extremely complex nature, and
long washing is requisite to secure its removal. If not thoroughly
removed, an action continues to be exerted which ultimately
results in the destruction of the picture, the blacks of which are
converted into a sulphide of silver. But the sulphurous gases
with which the atmosphere is impregnated, joined with the
complex effects produced by the albumen (with which photo-
graphic paper is usully prepared), acting on the silver in a

manner not yet clearly understood, exert a distructive influence
on photography. The introduction of gold toning has mitigated
this evil to a considerable extent; but an inspection of some
recent pictorial productions of photographers of reputation
suffices to show that it still exists, notwithstanding the known
care taken by them to obviate it.”
Still, the numerous improvements recently introduced into the
various photographic processes have done much towards giving
a permanent character to the productions of the camera.
We
have seen photographs, taken a few years ago, which seem as
clear and fresh as when they originally left the manipulator's
hands. Whether they will always remain so is a secret which
time alone can reveal, but the degree of durability which can
now be imparted to photographic pictures appears sufficient for
all ordinary purposes. The photographic art proper is most
largely employed in the production of cartes de visite and stereo-
scopic views. Of the former, several millions are annually
taken in this country alone. So great, indeed, is the number,
that more than one Chancellor of the Exchequer is said to have
considered the feasibility of materially adding to the National
income, by means of a small impost on these productions of
the photographer's studio. Who, in 1839, could have dreamed
that the almost simultaneous discoveries of Fox Talbot and
Daguerre would, within little more than a quarter of a century, not
only have furnished the means of employment to many thousands
of individuals, but also have suggested a new means of increas-
ing the public revenue ?
The popularity of the carte de visite arises from the singular
clearness and sharply defined portrait characteristic of this
description of photograph ; the small size of the picture employ-
ing only the centre of the lens. Dr. Wynter furnishes* several
interesting particulars respecting the demand for cartes de
visite. He states that their sale is now scarcely a fourth of
what it was when they first came into vogue. This, however,
may be the case with the large metropolitan establishments,
but in the provinces the rate of production appears to have
suffered no decrease ; on the contrary, the number of portraits
taken becomes larger each year. With regard to the sale of
cartes de visite of public characters, Dr. Wynter informs us that
it is still immense. Mr. Mayall, the well-known London Photo-
graphic Artist, who has taken the portraits of nearly all the
Royal Family, has received from Messrs. Marion, the photo-
graphic picture dealers, upwards of £35,000 for cartes de visite of
its various members. Indeed, the popularity of these portraits
has been something wonderful. When it was known that the
Princess Louise was to be wedded to the Marquis of Lorne, carte
de visite portraits of the illustrious couple appeared, as if by
magic, in all the photographic print shops throughout the king-
dom, and speedily found their way to America and Australia.
The London Stereoscopic Company sold many thousands of these

cartes, the demand for which still exists. The portraits of
favourite actresses command a very large sale, as do those of
popular statesmen, but it is difficult-save in exceptional cases-
to ascertain beforehand how far the carte of a new celebrity will
find favour with the public.
Stereoscopic views are prepared both on paper and glass, the
latter, although the most expensive, being far superior, by
reason of the delicacy and softness of the pictures which they
afford in the stereoscope. Transparent paper views, richly
coloured, also have a good sale, especially in France, where the
manufacture of this description of picture seems to be better
understood than in England. Stereoscopic views are divided
into two classes. The first consists of representations of land-
scapes, works of art, portraits, and so forth. The second class
comprises what may be termed reproductions of living pictures,
and illustrates the readiness with which the photographic art has
been turned to account in furnishing new means of remunerative
employment. Suppose, for instance, a stereoscopic view of “A
Music Lesson is required. A scene is prepared, as if for a
theatre; all the requisite accessories, such as pianoforte, chairs,
carpets, &c., are introduced ; and the living characters, appro-
priately attired, are carefully “posed.” The cost of getting up
one such scene is sometimes very great, but the expense is
generally covered by the sale of the pictures, as in the case of
that known as “ Little Red Riding Hood," which became very
popular. The preparation of the scenery for these stereoscopic
pictures sometimes forms a distinct occupation of itself, but it is
not so remunerative as it was a few years ago, when the stereo-
scope was a novelty: Stereoscopic views of actual landscapes
are always in demand. The list of these views is very extensive..
All the leading accessible places on the continent, in Asia,
Africa, America, and Australia, have found their way into the
stereoscope. We see the pyramids of Egypt, the mosques of
Constantinople, the rock temples of India, the Falls of Niagara,
the forests of Canada, the goldfields of Australia, the glaciers of
Switzerland, the ancient cities of Italy, the lochs of Scotland,
and the glens of Ireland brought before our eyes, as they
actually exist. It is nature itself, and thus the educational value
of Professor Wheatstone's discovery cannot be over-estimated. A
few stereoscopic views of scenes in Palestine afford us a more
vivid idea of the Holy Land than could be obtained from listen-
ing to half a dozen lectures. The stereoscopic views, or slides,
as they are more familiarly termed, are usually sold uncoloured,
save in the case of representations of living pictures; these
latter—as a rule—requiring a little colour, for the purpose of
heightening the effect. The slides are always uniform in size,
measuring 7 by 31 inches, but in France an attempt was recently
made to introduce a smaller description of slide measuring 4
by 2 inches. The experiment, however, proved a failure.
Photographic re-productions of celebrated pictures and en-
gravings are extremely numerous, and are of every imaginable

size, from the small vignette, an inch square, to the large cartoon
formed by joining several sheets together. Large numbers of
these are imported from Germany, especially from Berlin, where
several hundred men and women are engaged in their production.
The manufacture of photographic copies of popular engravings
is also largely carried on at Vienna and Pesth, causing serious
pecuniary loss to our leading printsellers, who frequently find
that on the continent excellent photographs of copyright English
pictures, such as Frith’s “ Railway Station,” are procurable at
ove-fourth the cost of the original engravings. In this country
such reproductions are justly regarded as infringements of the
law of copyright, and those engaged in the work of reproduction
are liable to punishment; nevertheless there exists an extensive
surreptitious sale of these pirated copies, to the great injury of
both engraver and printseller. Indeed, since the recent marked
development of the art of photography, the demand for high-
class engravings has sensibly diminished ; and it may be said
that the palmy days of line-engraving and lithography are rapidly
departing. This result is now being accelerated by the increas-
ing substitution of the sunbeam for the hand as the principal
engraving agent. In the Woodburytype, Autotype, and Helio-
type processes, we have the seeds of a great industry, which will,
at no distant period, effect a complete revolution in the art of
the engraver, whether on wood or metal, and the various occupa-
tions connected therewith.
The employment of photography for engraving purposes
occupied the attention of Mr. Fox Talbot almost from the
first. The difficulty of obtaining good fac-similes of works of
art, especially those of an elaborate or ornamental character,
seemed to open a wide field for the use of photography if any
means could be discovered whereby engraved plates might be
taken from the photographic negatives. Ultimately, following
up a clue obtained by Mr. Mongo Ponton, Mr. Fox Talbot found
that bichromatised gelatine or gum became, upon exposure to
light, insoluble in water, and that a plate could be prepared with
this material from which all those parts debarred from the light
might be dissolved away. This discovery naturally engaged the
attention of many scientific men, who from time to time made
public various methods of rendering photography useful as an
agent for engraving purposes, but most of these, however ex-
cellent in theory, were found of little real practical value. The
Autotype process was one of the first which promised-a successful
solution of the problem. By its means the amateur photographer
can produce finer pictures than ever emanated from the
engraver's hand. Bichromate of potash is the principal chemical
agent employed, and the fidelity of the copies to the originals is
most remarkable. The collection of line engravings at the
British Museum contains nothing which could successfully com-
pete with the productions of the Autotype Company, as exhibited
in their establishment in Rathbone Place. The colour of most
of these Autotypes is a beautiful monochrome, which can be pro-

duced in almost every shade, so as to exactly match the original
sketch, when made in sepia, chalk, or Indian ink. Among the
works illustrated by the Autotype Company is Her Majesty's
“ Tour in the Highlands." The drawings are by Adam, and are
reproduced in a style utterly impossible by the ordinary system
of engraving. But the Autotype method has one objection.
Every print is produced by handwork. The process is therefore
comparatively slow and expensive, except in the reproduction of
works of the highest class, where the comparative cost is a
minor consideration. Yet it is far more speedy and cheap than
line engraving: “The ordinary process of line engraving
says a writer in the “Edinburgh Review,'* to whom we are
indebted for some of the details above quoted—“is denied to all
“ but the highest class pictures ; no one but a great capitalist
6 will undertake such works. The expense is enormous, and the
6 time consumed in their accomplishment renders the chance of
“ their being finished in the lifetime of the artist very pro-
“ blematical. Raphael Morghen occupied six years in engraving
“ the “Transfiguration’; Doo was twelve years at work in
engraving the “Raising of Lazurus,' and it was not finished
“ when it passed out of the veteran engraver's hands. It is true
we have no longer such great works as these demanding the
" labours of the engraver ; but the genius we still have in the
“ artistic world cannot fail to benefit by these newly discovered
“rapid means of reproducing their works. In a week after the
picture has left the painter's easel, a proof impression is pre-
« sented to him for correction."
The Woodburytype process is a kind of relief printing, wholly
unlike
any method of engraving or copying previously known.
Here, again, the employment of bichromate is indispensable. A
mixture of gelatine and bichromate is poured upon a glass plate,
so as to produce a thin film. The plate so prepared is placed
under a glass negative, when the light dissolves all those portions
of the bichromatised gelatine not protected by the opaque parts
of the negative, thus leaving a kind of gelatine picture in relief.
The glass plate, with its raised surface of gelatine, is next covered
with a plate made of type metal and lead, and placed in an
hydraulic press, where it is subjected to a pressure of from 50 to
200 tons per square inch, according to the size of the plate.
Despite this enormous pressure the glass plate is not broken,
neither is the gelatine picture crushed, although it has imprinted
a perfect fac-simile on the surface of the metal, which is now
ready for printing from. The process of printing is fully as sin-
gular as the mode of obtaining the printing surface, and we regret
that we have not space for a detailed description. The pictures
so produced are frequently mistaken for real photographs, so
beautiful is their delicacy and clearness. Like the Autotype
process, the Woodburytype method has its disadvantage; all the
prints produced by it have to be trimmed and mounted upon
cardboard or stiff paper, an obstacle which prevents its extensive

use in the illustration of cheap works. Yet the process has a
future before it. Commercially it is said to be a success; and
the company owning the patent offers to reproduce fair-sized pic-
tures at less than a farthing per copy, a cost almost nominal com-
pared with that of engravings on steel or copper.
The Heliotype process is, in its method of working, somewhat
analogous to that of lithography. A glass plate is spread with
a film of bichromate and gelatine, covered with a glass negative,
and submitted to the action of light. The surface of the glass
plate, by a most ingenious process, is rendered fit for printing
from lithographic ink, an ordinary Albion press being used to
obtain the desired impressions. This is the nearest approach
to regular picture-printing yet devised, and by its means we can
obtain printed transcripts of photographs at an incredibly cheap
rate. “ The cost of production is so small, that it bids fair to
invade all the cheaper forms of literature, and to reproduce for
us drawings from nature, in place of inferior wood engravings
and lithographs.” The Heliotype system is worked upon a some-
what extensive scale at the works of Messrs. Edwards and Kidd,
at Willesden.
Another important application of the photographic art is that
discovered by Sir Edward James, and known as Photozincogra-
phy, which forms the cheapest known method of copying when
the objects to be reproduced are in simple black and white.
As usual, bichromate and gelatine are the principal agents em-
ployed in producing the necessary printing surface, a plate of zinc
being used instead of one of glass. By means of Photozinco-
graphy the two volumes of Domesday Book have been repro-
duced, and are now procurable at a low rate.
In like manner,
not a few volumes of our national manuscripts, Magna Charta,
and other important works, have been reproduced in fac-simile,
the pages or portions of each MS. being photographed, and then,
by means of the negative plates, transferred to the zinc. Thé
almost incredible cheapness of the new system is illustrated by
the fact that its use in place of ordinary engraving has occasioned
a saving of more than 2,000l. per annum in the preparation of the
Government Ordnance maps. It has even had a share in the
recent military disasters of France for, according to a writer in
the 'Edinburgh Review, “Some years ago, Count Moltke,
having heard of Sir Henry James's process, sent over officers from
Berlin to learn it, and the maps with which the Prussian soldiers
have been so liberally supplied in the campaign were produced
by photozincography. By the aid of these maps, the Prussians
found themselves better acquainted_than were their antagonists
with the topography of the invaded French departments.
In America photography sometimes takes the place of the
draughtsman on wood. The surface of the wood block is
properly prepared for the reception of the photographic picture,
but the absence of lines renders it difficult for the engraver to
proceed with his work, unless assisted by the pencil of the artist.
The use of photography is mostly resorted to for the production

of portraits upon wood, the pictures being carefully touched up by
competent artists before being placed in the hands of the en-
graver. The proprietor of one of the leading American illustrated
newspapers has several travelling photographic studios, mounted
on wheels, and so arranged that they can be placed on a railway
truck or drawn by horses, for transport to the places required.
By this means he is enabled to obtain, with wonderful rapidity,
views of localities or occurrences of public interest, and to repro-
duce the same in his paper several days earlier than if he had
trusted to the assistance of ordinary artists. In London, photo-
graphy on wood is sometimes employed in the case of representa-
tions of machinery, specimens of pottery, and other productions
of manufacturing industry; but there exists a strong prejudice
against it amongst the wood-engravers. They seem instinctively
to fear the introduction of the photographic art, no matter in what
form, into their profession. Perhaps their fear is not unreason-
able.
Micro-photography has its uses, as the circumstances con-
nected with the siege of Paris by the Germans have clearly
shown. But for the assistance of the camera, how would it have
been possible to present a whole page of the "Times' news-
paper, crowded with advertisements from helpless refugees, in a
space measuring an inch and a half in length by an inch in
width? Yet this was effected without difficulty. These minute
reproductions were sent from London to Bordeaux, thence by
carrier pigeon to Paris.* “When received there, they were
magnified by the aid of the magic lantern to a large size, and
thrown upon a screen. A staff of clerks immediately transcribed
the messages, and sent them off to the places indicated by the
advertisers.”' In this manner communications were systemati-
cally kept up with the besieged in the French capital, despite
every precaution on the part of the watchful enemy. But
there are also many other useful aplications of photography,
If, by its assistance, we can compress the contents of a page of
the Bible into a space no larger than that occupied by the head
of a pin, we can also with its aid enlarge the most minute objects
to a comparatively gigantic size. A photograph of a fly's wing
can be magnified, when shown by means of the magic lantern, to
the extent of several square feet, a fact which makes us feel that
the art is destined to form the key which shall unlock to us
the wondrous secrets of the insect world, and render the micro-
scope an almost obsolete scientific appliance. In medicine and
its allied sciences the use of photography is found invaluable,
and the camera is rapidly becoming a constant companion of the
surgeon and physician. No human skill can rival it as a means
of accurately delineating the various external aspects of disease
or sickness. In the law courts also it is gradually taking the
place of the expert. During the progress of the earlier portions .
of the famous Tichborne trial, doubts arose respecting the accu-

racy of several of the fac-simiie letters produced. Those doubts
proved to be well founded. The utmost vigilance on the part
of those entrusted with the laborious task of copying the volumi-
nous correspondence put in evidence, could not prevent the occur-
rence of vital mistakes ; for in this remarkable case the mere
spelling of a word became most important. But photography
cannot err. By its agency we have exact fac-similes of the
original letters, and are enabled to note the exact character of
the writing and spelling, a result which no other agency could
possibly achieve.*
Were we to mention all the various uses of which the photo-
graphic art is capable we should probably fill many pages of the
Companion,' and perhaps weary the reader ; but we ought not
to umit to state that in the new Act for the Prevention of
Crime several enactments are made with a view to facilitate the
identification of criminals. A register of all persons convicted
in the United Kingdom is to be kept ; regulations for their
portraits to be taken by the photographer may be made, and such
regulations may prescribe the times at which and the manner and
dress in which the prisoners are to be taken, the number of por-
traits of each prisoner to be printed, and the persons to whom they
are to be sent. Any prisoner refusing to obey any regulation as to
photographing is to be deemed guilty of an offence against prison
discipline. Thus photography has been rendered an instrument
for the preservation of order and the protection of life and
property. Surely, never before had man such a useful or
willing servant as this marvellous art, the capabilities of which
are only beginning to be made known to us. For instance,
it was but the other day that a Nottingham manufacturer took
out a provisional patent for employing printing surfaces prepared
by the process of photolithography, photozincography, or other
printing surfaces prepared by the aid of photography, for orna-
menting linen collars, cuffs, and shirt fronts. Already muslin
and cambric handkerchiefs, with photographic pictures, have
found their way into the market.
As before mentioned, these numerous practical applications of
photography afford employment to very large numbers of persons.
În London alone there are upwards of five hundred professional
photographers. The ‘Post Office Directory' for 1871, gives the
names of over three hundred photographic establishments, with-
out including those in the metropolitan suburbs. Assuming
three to form the average number of persons employed in each
establishment, we have something like fifteen hundred indi-
viduals in the metropolis depending upon the practice of the
photographic art, for their means of subsistence. Then there are
the provincial establishments. Of these one is to be found in
almost every town; the cities and larger towns each possessing
several. In nearly all of these the operations are confined to the
taking of portraits. Next, we have the photographers employed
* The photographic fac-similes of the Tichborne letters, also the micro-photographs

in preparing stereoscopic views, or in the various processes to
which we have briefly alluded. Of the actual number of these
it is impossible to form any reliable estimate ; even the Census
returns will be found to throw very little light on this head, but
they certainly form most numerous class. A man of consider-
able experience informs us that he considered one thousand would
not be too high a calculation for the number of those so em-
ployed in the metropolis. The printing of photographs forms a
distinct occupation, and provides work for a large number of per-
sons, including many females, who are also engaged in mounting
the photographs and rectifying any little imperfections which
may be noticed. The colouring of photographs is also an occu-
pation by itself. The colourists are chiefly females, stereo-
scopic views being the articles which pass most frequently into
their hands. In the higher branches of photographic colouring,
the number of artists is comparatively limited. Most of these
latter were portrait-painters, whose art has been injurionsly
affected by the increasing use of photography. The number of
wholesale photographic publishers is comparatively limited. There
are not a score of them in London. But although so few, several
of these establishments do an enormous trade. Messrs. Marion,
of Soho Square, and the London Stereoscopic Company, of Regent
Street and Cheapside, have, within the last five years, issued several
millions of cartes de visite alone. The retail trade is principally
carried on by booksellers, fancy stationers, and toy-dealers. In
many instances the sale of photographs has gradually become the
leading feature of the shops wherein they are vended. The number
of such places in the metropolis exceeds two thousand. These are
regularly visited by travellers in the employ of the wholesale
firms, through whom any new photograph which may be pub-
lished speedily finds its way into the shop windows.
In the trades or occupations connected with the various pro-
cesses in which photography forms the principal element, the
number of persons employed is greater than is generaliy imagined.
Take, for instance, the manufacture of photographic apparatus.
The enormous demand for glass plates has exercised a perceptible
influence upon the glass-making industry, and indirectly con-
tributed to its improvement, it being necessary that the glass
plates used for photographic purposes should be as clear and colour-
Iess as possible. Then there is the manufacture of the numerous
earthenware dishes, baths, and other vessels, to say nothing of the
immense quantity of chemicals annually required. It has been
said-we know not with what truth--that the high price of eggs,
of which English housewives are continually complaining, is occa-
sioned by the vast numbers of these domestic necessaries used for
the purpose of making the albumen so frequently required in pre-
paring the glass plates and paper for receiving the desired impres-
sions. The quantity of precious metals used in the production of
chloride of gold and nitrate of silver, setting aside the other like
preparations, is fabulously large, and forms the most costly
department of the art. The list of chemicals employed is rather
E 2

lengthy, in consequence of each photographer having his own
particular method, as in the case of the dry collodion process,
for which there exist countless recipes, but the really essential
chemicals are comparatively few in number. Their preparation
has, however, become a distinct business. The same may be said
of the manufacture of albuminised paper used in obtaining pho-
tographic prints. No photographer now cares to prepare his own
paper. He can procure it more cheaply and of better quality from
those who make it their business to produce the proper article
required. The manufacture of photographic colouring materials
is another branch of industry called into being by the new art,
for although ordinary water-colours can be used those generally
employed by professional colourers are specially prepared.
The production of the various apparatus used in connection
with photography necessitates the employment of no small
amount of skilled labour. The best lenses come from the Con-
tinent and are very costly, but those of English make are very
little inferior. The cameras are invariably constructed of wood,
generally of mahogany, the fittings being of brass. The manu-
facture of these constitutes a distinct trade, as does the produc-
tion of stereoscopes and other articles of a similar character.
The manufacture of cardboard has received an immense impetus
from the substitution of paper for glass as a material for the
printing of photographs. In several establisments the quantity
of cardboard made annually has been doubled, and even trebled,
within the last few years, the principal demand being for cards
on which to mount cartes de visite. Of these several millions
are produced every year, exclusive of the quantities exported to
the colonies and elsewhere. The cartes and other photographic
pictures, when mounted are placed in a metal rolling machine,
which renders their surfaces perfectly smooth and glossy. The
use of these and similar machines is increasing and bids fair to
furnish new channels of employment for our more ingenious
mechanics.
The preparation of the scenes used as backgrounds by photo-
graphic artists also forms a source of employment to numerous
individuals. They are made in the same manner as the scenes
used in theatres, but great care is required in the choice of
colours. Slate, black, and white form almost the only tints used.
The variety of backgrounds is incredible. It is found from
experience that while in aristocratic neighbourhoods the sitter
prefers a plain background, in more plebeian localities, such as
St. Giles's or Whitechapel
, nothing less than a magnificent balus-
trade, with fluted column and heavy curtains to match, will
suflice. Besides these scenes, numerous accessories, in the shape
of rustic tables, &c., are also provided from the same sources.
The erection of photographic studios is less a matter of special
training, so far as the builder is concerned, than some would
suppose. The photographic artist is generally his own architect,
a fact which may possibly help to explain the reason why so
many of the existing studios are comparative failures. They are

a
either too light or too dark; the means resorted to for rectifying
these defects being frequently all but useless. On the other
hand, several of the most perfect studios in the kingdom, have
been erected under the exclusive superintendence of the artists
to whom they belong. The proper fitting up of a studio requires
many indispensable adjuncts, such as the head-rest, chairs, the
seats of which can be
raised or depressed at pleasure, books for
sitters to hold, &c. The operating room is usually fitted-up with
yellow glass or calico, but of late thin sheets of india-rubber
have been coming into use.
Among the trades which have profited by the development of
the photographic art is that of the picture-frame maker. Within
the last few years the consumption of materials used in the
manufacture of picture frames, and of the tasteful passe-partouts,
has become enormously extended. Many of the passe-partouts are
imported from the Continent, but the English manufacturers are
rapidly driving their rivals out of the market. Not a few of the
metal, wood, and leather frames used for cartes also come from
abroad. The greater number, however, are of home manufacture.
The same may be said of the numerous photographic albums
which find their way into the shop-windows. The taste and skill
displayed in their production is frequently very great. A variety
of materials, such as ivory, pearl, tortoiseshell, and even coloured
glass are used in addition to leather or velvet, in their manu-
facture. The cheapest descriptions come from Germany, but
these are very inferior. The prices range from the humble
shilling to the aristocratic guinea, but there are albums costing
as much as five or ten guineas. The average number of portraits
each album is capable of bolding is fifty ; some are made to con-
tain two or three hundred, few, if any, hold less than twenty-
five ; and others are combined with musical boxes, which com-
mence playing when the clasp of the book is unfastened. These
albums have now become indispensable adjuncts of the drawing-
room and parlour, and seem likely to retain their popularity for
many years to come.
The manufacture of lockets is another trade which has bene-
fited by the introduction of photography. The ease and cheap-
ness with which photographic portraits can be produced on the
most minute scale have again rendered the locket a favourite
article of personal adornment, to the great profit of the working
goldsmiths and manufacturers of cheap jewellery. The portrait
is generally cut from a carte de visite, and inserted by the vendor
of the locket.
But if the art of photography has assisted in promoting the
prosperity of certain trades and occupations, and opened up
fresh means of employment for no inconsiderable proportion of
our population, it has also caused the extinction of various
callings, and endangered the existence of others, so true is it
that no public gain was ever yet secured without some degree of
loss and suffering. The painters of cheap water-colour portraits
have disappeared ; as live the producers of silhouettes, those

hideous black-paper profiles, which formerly did duty as like-
With these have also vanished the gaudily-coloured and
varnished prints representing “Daniel in the Lion's Den,” “ The
Sailor's Return," and similar scenes, that were so frequently
found in the dwellings of our labouring classes. But, for
every individual deprived of his bread by the progress of the
various occupations connected with the practice of photography,
hundreds have found in connection with it the means of obtaining
remunerative employment. The few have been sacrificed to the
welfare of the many.
Indirectly, photography has exercised a powerful influence
over many industries to which it apparently has no relation.
By familiarising the “million” with correct representations of
even the simplest objects, it has assisted in educating and
refining the popular taste so far as art is concerned. Of course,
other influences have contributed materially to this result, but
none more so than photography. With the gradual develop-
ment of a purer art taste, the unsightly plaster of Paris dogs
and cats, china cows, and other eye-sores, are disappearing
from the mantel-pieces of our artisans and becoming replaced by
elegant vases and ornaments, more in harmony with the beau-
tiful sun-pictures which decorate the wall above them. In
fact, photography is becoming the great art instructor of the
masses, and in this way is assisting materially the development
and prosperity of our various art manufactures. In fact, it has
become impossible to define where its influence begins or ends.
Even in the commercial world it has caused thousands of
pounds to be saved in the matter of samples. Does a builder
require a number of metal brackets from Birmingham ? In-
stead of having to incur the delay and expense attending the
transmission of a specimen from the manufacturer, ho receives
by return of post a photograph of the article wanted, and gives
his order accordingly. This system of substituting photographs
for actual samples is gaining ground in commercial circles, the
saving of time and expense being so obvious. In the manu-
facturing districts there are establishments devoted exclusively
to the production of photographic representations of specimens of
industrial manufacturing skill. In several large manufactories
photographers form a portion of the regular industrial staff.
But we have said enough respecting the economic value of the
new art.
We are only at the commencement of its history, yet
we have seen enough to convince us that it is destined to play
an important part in the social and industrial progress of the
world, to share with steam and electricity the honour of spread-
ing the blessings of true civilisation among the nations, and of
preparing the way for that glorious, peaceful future, in' which,
despite the general arming of the peoples of Europe, we still
firmly believe.

THE POSTAL TELEGRAPH SYSTEM.
The control of the electro-telegraphic system throughout the
United Kingdom is one of the largest con mercial enterprises
ever undertaken by the British Government. In accordance
with the genius of our institutions we leave trade and manufac-
tures as much as possible to private hands, seldom allowing the
Ministers of the Crown to become traders or makers in the
name of the State. Where there are exceptions to this rule—as
in the postal system, the manufacture of small arms at Enfield,
the casting of cannon at Woolwich, the making of army clothing
at Pimlico, the building of ships in the naval dockyards, &c.--
there are special reasons for each exception ; and if any addition
to the number is proposed, the Legislature scans the matter
closely before giving assent. When, therefore, the purchase of
the existing telegraphs by the Government was suggested, and
the management of them consigned to the postal authorities,
reasons for the change were expected and were given. The
Marquis of Hartington, as Postmaster-General at the time
when the new scheme was adopted, mentioned various reasons
for expecting favourable results. Under the old system more
than 700 towns had a surplus accommodation in being served
each by three companies, with offices usually situated close
together; while, on the other hand, there were 486 towns with no
telegraphic office except at the railway station, and in 346 of these
instances the station was quite outside the limits of the town
itself. A central control, it was urged, would bring a great addition
to the number of telegraphic messages by affording increased
facilities to the public. Not only would the wires be brought
into the ordinary post-offices of the principal towns, but new
telegraph offices would be opened in all directions; while every
letter-box, wall-box, and pillar-post would be open for the
reception of the papers on which the messages are written.
Moreover there would be an increase in the number of hours per
day during which telegraphic work would be done. All these
facilities, it was said, would encourage the public to adopt
the telegraphic system much more largely than it had been
adopted under the Companies régime. Another temptation
would be offered by a low tariff of charge--low at least for all long
distances, and convenient because uniform. It was not intended
that the system should yield a profit to the State. If it paid
the working expenses and interest on the whole capital expended,
that would suffice, the object being solely to confer on the
public, in regard to the telegraph system, the same convenience
enjoyed under the reformed Post Office arrangements.
Public discussion on these matters in 1866 and 1867 prepared
the way for legislative action in the following years.
THE LEGISLATIVE SANCTION.
The statute which placed these important powers in the

hands of the Government received the Royal Assent on the 31st
of July, 1868 (31 and 32 Vict., cap. 110). The preamble to the
Act declares that—“It would be attended with great advantage.
to the State as well as to merchants and traders and to the public
generally, if a cheaper, more widely extended, and more expeditious
system of telegraphy were established, and to that end (it is recom-
mended that) the Postmaster-General be empowered to work tele-
graphs in connexion with the administration of the Post Office.”
And then the mɔde of carrying out the plan is described. The
Postmaster-General, with the sanction of the Treasury, is em-
powered to expend any money entrusted to him by Parliament
for that purpose, in the purchase of lines of telegraph belonging
to the several companies. All agreements for such purposes are
to be submitted to Parliament before being ratified. The
Telegraph Companies are empowered to sell their respective un-
dertakings under conditions specifically declared. The servants
of the companies are either to be taken into the employ of the
Government, or are to receive compensation in the form of
annuities. Three companies—the Electric, the British and Irish
Magnetic, and the United Kingdom Telegraphic-are to be paid
fixed sums defined in this Act; the terms with other companies
being left for subsequent arrangement. In purchasing by agree-
ment a company is to be bound by two-thirds of the votes of
shareholders present in person, or by proxy, at a special meeting.
Telegraph companies may, with certain limitations, demand to be
bought up by the Government; and if they cannot agree as to
terms an arbitrator appointed by the Board of Trade is to settle
the matter. The wires belonging to the Railway Companies, as
well as to the Telegraph Companies, are to be bought up; and
the Postmaster-General is to acquire a right of way over lands,
for his wires.
So much for the powers obtained ; and now for the mode of
exercising them. On all the railway wires the Postmaster-
General is to transmit messages relating to the business of the
Railway Companies free of charge. To the public a uniform
rate is to be charged irrespective of distance; one shilling for
twenty words, and threepence for every additional five words,
the names and addresses of the senders and receivers not being
included in this counting. This charge is to cover the cost of
delivery by special foot messenger within one mile of the
terminal office, or within its town postal delivery if it is a head
office, and if that delivery extends for more than a mile from it.
When, however, the addressee does not reside within these
limits the message will be delivered free of charge by the next
postal delivery. If the sender desires, the telegram will be sent
by special foot messenger at a charge for porterage beyond such
limits not exceeding sixpence per double mile. The payments,
except for porterage, are to be made in stamps. Special agree-
ments may be made with newspapers, clubs, news rooms, and
exchange rooms, for the transmission and delivery of telegrams.
The terms for this kind of service are to be lower during the

81
night than during the day ; viz., from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., seventy-
five words for one shilling ; but from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m., one hundred
words for one shilling. The special use of a wire (if the
number of public wires permits) may be granted for twelve
hours a day to the proprietor of any newspaper, club, news
room, or exchange room, at a charge of £500 per annum, with
the consent of the Treasury to each such agreement, and with
special safeguards against favoritism or monopoly. The Post-
master-General, to carry out these plans, is empowered to
sell the necessary stamps and stamped forms; and to arrange
that pillar-boxes and wall-boxes are to be rendered just as
available for the receipt of telegrams as the ordinary receiving
houses.
Such, in brief, is the Telegraph Act of 1868. Before noticing
a supplementary Act passed in the following year, it may be well
to advert to a difficult question which then had to be determined,
relating to the conditions under which the Government would
engage in this work. Ought it to be a monopoly, or not? In
the conveyance of letters, the Post Office has a monopoly: no
other corporations, companies, firms, or traders being allowed to
pursue the trade of letter-carrying within the United Kingdom.
The reason is that the State raises a revenue out of postal
matters and does not choose to have this revenue (applied to the
regular expenses the State) lessened by competition. When
several millions sterling were about to be paid for purchasing the
telegraphs in the United Kingdom, it became necessary to settle
whether a similar monopoly should be granted to the State for
message-delivery as for letter-carrying Mr. Frank Ives Scuda-
more, Second Secretary to the Post Office, on whom has mainly
rested the duty of organizing the new system, has seen reason to
change his first opinion on this subject; and his later views have
met with acceptance. In 1868, when the first Bill was under
the consideration of a Committee of the House of Commons, he
stated that he did not ask the Legislature to give a monopoly to
the Government: nay, he would rather work without one than
with one :-“I am inclined to think that a legal monopoly would
be a disadvantage instead of an advantage to us. If we had it,
inventors and patentees of improvements, or so-called improve-
ments, in telegraphic instruments and apparatus, would have to
look to us, and to us only, for the use of their inventions; and
even if these inventions were worthless the inventors would be
able to make a strong appeal to us to try them, because there
would be no one else who could try them. On the other hand, if
we have not the legal monopoly, and we decline to try inventions
of real merit, the inventors will have some chance of finding
others to
carry them out."
He thought that, without any
monopoly, the Government would have sufficient inducement to
give fair play to any new system or improved instruments--
quite as much so as the Telegraph Companies “ When a Tele-
graph Company has had a large amount of capital locked up in
any particular kind of instrument it has naturally hesitated to

employ another instrument, even although it might have great
superiority over the existing one. The Government, to a certain
extent, would have the same disinclination ; but the disinclina-
tion would not be quite so strong because the Companies have
to find a good dividend for their shareholders, whereas the
Government need only make its system self-supporting. But
there is another reason why I thiuk the Government would be
more likely to take up new improvements : this is, that no
pressure whatever can be put on a commercial company to adopt
any particular instrument, however good it may be ; but any
amount of pressure could be put on the Post Office, through
Parliament, to use a new instrument if it is one of acknow-
ledged merit.” He further expressed an opinion that the
public would have more confidence in the Government manage-
ment of telegraphs if it were not a monopoly ; that if there
were no monopoly the Government would be bound by law to
prosecute any infringement of it, and that such prosecution
would be a very disagreeable duty for the Post Office to under-
take. Mr. Scudamore afterwards modified some of these
opinions. After the Act of 1868 had been passed, he heard of
niew schemes being set on foot for electric telegraphs in populous
districts. As it is admitted that the Government will lose in some
of the thinly or poorly inhabited localities where the telegrams
will be too few in number to pay the working expenses, the
busier commercial localities are looked to as a source of recom-
pense; and if private companies or speculative firms are allowed
to dig into those richer mines the whole system might become a
source of loss rather than of gain to the nation. Some such
schemes were on foot, while others were merely intended as
troublesome intrusions to be bought up by the Government as
a means of getting rid of them. As a protection from specu-
lators monopoly was now deemed necessary. The monopoly need
not necessarily be a permanent one; because, as the Post Office
privileges are dependent on annual estimates voted by Parliament,
the monopoly could be taken away in any particular year if the
Legislature so determined. Mr. Scudamore was asked, in 1869,
by a Committee of the House of Commons whether he was
aware that there was a disinclination on the part of the public to
permit such a monopoly as this and by what argument such dis-
inclination could be removed? He said that one ground for the
public feeling was a fear that a Government entrusted with a
monopoly would be lazy. “But I do not allow," he added,
" that this holds good with reference to the Post Office. It does
its work under the eye of the public; it does a work from day
to day before the public which is extremely acceptable when
well done and which is perfectly intolerable when badly done;
and the result is that every shortcoming on the part of the
Post Office is discovered at once, and complained of; we are
always working under pressure."
As a means of carrying out the Act of 1868, and of amending
some of its details, another Act was passed in 1869 (32 and 33

owner.
Vict., cap. 73). This statute makes telegraphy as much a com-
mercial monopoly as letter-carrying. The nation is to pay a
large sum of money to buy up existing concerns and to work the
system, and as there are no à priori means of knowing whether
the undertaking will be a gain or a loss to the state, a monopoly
is established, in order that the best-paying wires may com -
pensate for the worse-paying. In statutory phraseology it is
announced that, “In order to protect the public revenue, it is
expedient that similar powers to those conferred upon the Post-
master-General with respect to the exclusive privilege of carry-
ing letters should be enacted with reference to the transmission
of public telegraphic messages within the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland.” The Government (the Postmaster-
General being the official representative) is to have the exclusive
privilege of receiving, collecting, transmitting, and delivering tele-
grams within the United Kingdom subject to specified exceptions.
The excepted kind of telegrams are as follow :-(1) Telegrams
transmitted by private wires maintained and used solely for
private use and relating to the business or private affairs of the
(2) Telegrams transmitted through wires maintained
for the private use of a corporation, company, or person, and in
respect of which no money passes as a charge for the transmission.
(3) Telegrams sent by persons having the written license or
consent of the Postmaster-General so to do for reasons assigned.
(4) Telegrams transmitted by any Telegraph Company existing
at the time of passing the Act, but whose undertakings have not
yet been purchased by the Government. (5) Telegrams pro-
vided for by special clauses in the Act of 1868. (5) Telegrams
transmitted to or from any place out of the United Kingdom.
With these exceptions every person is subject to a penalty of
£5 for transmitting a telegram otherwise than through the
agency and to the profit of the Government. The Treasury is,
by this Act, empowered to raise a sum of £7,000,000 by the
creation of terminable annuities to enable the Postmaster-
General to purchase existing telegraphs and construct new ones.
The Pustmaster-General is to pay into the Consolidated Fund
all the money he receives for telegraphic work, while his ex-
penses are to be defrayed out of annual parliamentary votes.
Every year an exact account is to be rendered to Parliament of
the receipts and expenses, and arrangements are to be made for
paying off gradually the sum appropriated to the purchase of
the existing lines, à sinking-fund for this purpose being formed
out of the surplus profits of working.
A third statute, passed in July, 1870, (33 and 34 Vict., cap.
88), extends the operation of the former Acts to the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man without introducing any particular
changes in other ways.
THE PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANIES.
When the telegraphs were about to be taken over by the
Government, it became desirable to ascertain how far the opera-

tions of Joint Stock Companies had extended in this kind of
enterprise so far as concerned the United Kingdom. The Board
of Trade accordingly presented the necessary information to
Parliament in the summer of 1868. One return related to
Railway Companies. It was found that there were 83 Companies
which possessed electric telegraphs as part of their undertaking.
There were 728 telegraph stations, or places from which messages
were sent, used for the purposes of the railway only, and 1,226
used for public purposes only, or for public and railway purposes
conjointly. There were 5,157 miles of line constructed, com-
prising 16,191 miles of wire. Another return related to
Telegraph Companies. Those whose lines were wholly within the
United Kingdom, or who owned submarine cables of which one
terminus was in any part of the United Kingdom, comprised the
following:
Atlantic Telegraph Company.
Anglo-American Telegraph Company.
Bonelli's Telegraph Company.
British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company.
Channel Islands Telegraph Company.
Electric and International Telegraph Company.
London and Provincial Telegraph Company.
Poole and Bournemouth Telegraph Company.
Reuter's Telegraph Company.
South Western of Ireland Telegraph Company.
Submarine Telegraph Company.
United Kingdom Telegraph Company.
Universal Private Telegraph Company.
These Companies had 2,155 stations, 16,879 miles of land line,
79,646 miles of wire, 4,688 miles of submarine cable, and 8,122
miles of wire imbedded in the cables. The British or Irish
ports at which the Submarine Cables started, and the Continental
or American ports to which they extended, were as follows:-
From Valentia, Ireland
To Newfoundland.
Dunwich, Suffolk
Landvoort, Holland.
Lowestoft, Suffolk

Dover..
Calais.
Folkestone
Boulogne.
Beachey Head
Dieppe.
Dover..
La Panne, Belgium.
Ramsgate
Ostend, Belgium.

Besides these, there were several small cables across seas,
estuaries, and rivers within the United Kingdom :-
Portpatrick, Scotland, to Donaghadee, Ireland.
Killantringham, Scotland, to Whitehead, Ireland.
Abermawr, Wales, to Greenore, Ireland.
Blackhead, Scotland, to Whitehead, Ireland.
Across Waterford Harbour, Ireland.
Across the Humber, near Hull.
Across the Firth of Forth, near Leith.
Across the Tay, near Broughty Ferry.
Across the Solent to Isle of Wight.

These returns do not, in themselves, show the number of
telegraphic stations or of miles of wire within the United King-
dom belonging to telegraph companies, because those companies
which, by means of submerged cables, connect other countries
with our shores apply their statistics to the whole extent of their
several undertakings. For instance, the Atlantic and Anglo-
American Companies, which connect Ireland with America
by means of the cables of 1865 and 1866, have five short
cables measuring 563 miles altogether over portions of sea and
estuary near the American coast, together with 1,576 miles of
land-telegraph in Newfoundland, Prince Edward's Island, and
New Brunswick.
Two or three of the Telegraph Companies possessed lines of
peculiar character at the time when the return was prepared in
1868. Bonelli's Company was established to work M. Bonelli's
ingenious system of printing the telegrams with types ; a line of
15 wires was erected for the purpose from Manchester to Liver-
pool and the system was tried for some months successfully,
but capital was not forthcoming to extend the operations. The
London and Provincial Company had 82 stations, 163 miles
of line, and 654 miles of wire, mostly within the limits of the
Metropolis, besides private telegraphs for connecting places of
business, fire brigade stations, postal district offices, &c. The
Universal Private Telegraph Company had wires and instru-
ments rented to private persons, mostly for private use. The
plan was in operation in seven districts, and gave employment
to the following number of instruments and miles of wire :

The system comprised, from its nature and purpose, a number
of very short telegraphs independent of each other. The
other Companies, such as the Electric and International, the
British and Irish Magnetic, the United Kingdom, &c., had their
several lines of wire connected into a vast network.
Combining the accounts sent in by the railway companies
with those supplied by the telegraph companies we find that in
1868 there were within the United Kingdom 4,119 telegraph
stations, 22,036 miles of line, and 95,637 miles of wire. Correction
has here been made in certain instances which were eutered
twice by the railway companies and by the telegraph companies.

The general rule adopted was to pay the companies twenty-one
times as much as the annual profit of their working, or, more
briefly, twenty-one years' purchase, after deducting an amount
for depreciation of plant by wear and tear. That these terms
were liberal was shown by the fact that the prices of telegraph
companies' shares rose largely and rapidly in the market as
as the conditions of purchase by the Government were
known. It was felt that the new system would start badly if
the companies had any reason to complain of niggardly treat-
ment.
COMMENCEMENT OF WORKING.
When the Act of 1868 had been passed the Postal authorities
could not at once proceed to purchase the existing telegraphs
because the money for so doing was not yet voted by the House
of Commons and because many preliminary enquiries had to be
made. Skilful and experienced persons were deputed by the
Postmaster-General to examine all the telegraphic wires, some of
which were found to have been deteriorated by the smoke and
fumes of the great towns; to examine all the telegraphic instru-
ments and the galvanic batteries which furnished the motive
power in order to estimate the amount or value of depreciation
in wires and instruments ; to visit all the post offices and tele-
graph offices in the United Kingdom ; to enquire what new offices
and what alteratious and improvements in those already exist-
ing were needed; to ascertain the relative efficiency in the
several codes or systems of telegraphic language; to prepare
maps on
a large scale for showing old and new circuits of
transmission ; to examine the accounts of the Companies with a
view of estimating the net profits realized ; and to obtain the
consent of no less than four thousand persons and local boards
in selecting and appropriating spots for new offices, lines, posts,
and wires.
These preliminaries being settled and the money voted by Par-
liament the existing telegraphs were for the most part purchased
during the later months of 1869, but formal possession was not
obtained till February, 1870. At that time the number of tele-
graph stations transferred from the Companies to the Govern-
ment was 10)7; the total has been rapidly increased since,
chiefly by transacting telegraph business at the ordinary post

Several hundreds have been added in the six months subsequent
to May last. On the day of the transfer to the Government, there
were 1900 railway stations at which telegraphic business was
conducted, and these, added to the 1007, made a total of 2907.
The number of railway stations at which telegraph work is
done is now somewhat smaller than before, owing to the re-
arrangement of the system. On the 31st of May, 1871, there
were in operation 4211 telegraph stations, 2383 being postal and
1828 railway.
The numerous ways in which it has been necessary to expend
capital, in addition to the compensation to the several companies
for the purchase of their lines of telegraph, show how vast and
complex is the whole system. The following were the principal
items down to the end of June last :-

STAFF OF SERVANTS.
An important and interesting feature connected with the new
system was the organization of a staff of persons competent to
manage the telegraphing instruments and to conduct the varied
office business. When the lines of telegraph were made over by
the Companies to the Government they were giving employment
to about 2,500 persons, 2,030 males and 470 females. Nearly all
of these were employed by the Government and regarded as civil
servants of the Crown, being graduated in classes for pay and
promotion according to their ascertained merit. As a large and
steady augmentation of the working staff would inevitably be
needed it became important to determine in what manner new
hands should be obtained and drilled, and whether males or

females should predominate among them. Mr. Scudamore in one
of his reports to the Postmaster-General adverts to many reasons
why women are suited for this kind of work. They have quick-
ness of eye and ear and delicacy of touch, they are more patient
than men during long sitting in one spot and take more kindly
to sedentary employment; they will willingly work for lower wages
than men; the remuneration will tempt women of fairly good
education, while men equally well educated would seek for some
employment bringing higher pay; and lastly, women are less dis-
posed than men to “strike” or combine for the purpose of extorting
higher wages. Moreover, it is found that the tone of behaviour
among the whole staff is raised by the employment of women
among them, provided prudent and kindly supervision be exer-
cised. The women would be employed only during the day,
and comfortable arrangements would be made for their meals.
They would bring with them the materials for their own dinners,
but would be provided gratuitously with cooking vessels, crockery,
table-linen, firing, and attendance, and would be also furnished
freely with tea and bread and butter at certain hours. These
observations were meant by Mr. Scudamore to apply chiefly to
the great central telegraph-station in the City, but the fitness of
women and girls for telegraph work generally in country as well
as in town was strongly affirmed by him.
The augmentation, whether in the number of male or of female
assistants, had to be obtained ; and a noteworthy system was
adopted for this purpose. Most of the clerks employed by the
companies were conversant each with only one kind of instrument,
and required much drilling before they could work the new
Government system. Moreover, the telegraph clerks at the rail-
way stations could not be removed until substitutes had been
obtained for them. Under these circumstances a competent
corps of trained clerks was organised to teach all the others. Each
of these teachers traversed a certain district, passing from office to
office, guiding and assisting the learners, teaching them how to
practise on dummy instruments provided for the purpose, and
noting and reporting their progress. A bonus of ll. was promised
to any postmaster, receiver, sorter, or letter-carrier, or any member
of his family, who could satisfy an examiner of the possession of a
certain degree of proficiency in the management of telegraphing
instruments. Telegraph schools were also established to train
persons for direct appointment, without any bonus.
Under the system thus organised the number of clerks or tele-
graphers increased from 2,500 at the beginning of 1870 to 5,000,
and the number has since been augmented by several hundreds.
Out of these, about 1,500 were young women, some of whom
were placed in the Central Telegraph Department and the rest as
assistants to postmasters in town and country. The bonus of il.
per head has been the means of introducing about 2,000 new
hands, mostly the sons and daughters of letter-carriers and sorting
clerks.
At the telegraph schools established in London in 1869,
and in some country towns in 1870 and the following year, young

;
persons receive sufficient instruction to render them useful in
telegraph work in periods varying from two to three months.
The young clerks when sufficiently taught commence work at
12s. per week for males and 8s. for females, efficiency leading to a
proportionate rise in salary ; it is said that the average is about
15s. per week for females and 25s. for males. These are the tele-
graphers, the actual transmitters and decipherers of the tele-
grams.
Many of the young women employed are the orphan daughters
of professional men, or of tradesmen and clerks, the salary being
sufficient to tempt many who would otherwise be sempstresses.
The telegraph schools have supplied occupation for about twice
as many females as males. In the night males only are employed;
and men also attend to the telegrams to and from foreign coun-
tries, many of which are in foreign languages.
Besides the clerks at the various stations boys are employed
as messengers to carry the telegram-papers to the houses of the
addressees. These boys required a good deal of drilling, but
they have gradually been brought into excellent order. One
Sunday last spring the London contingent assembled in the City
whence they marched to Westminster Abbey, where Dean Stanley
delivered a special address to them. At the date when the
telegraphs were transferred from the Companies to the Govern-
ment there were 1,470 messengers employed, and the number
has since largely increased.
THE TELEGRAPHING INSTRUMENTS.
It will not be necessary to describe in detail the beautiful
instruments employed, but some notice is desirable of the dif-
ferent kinds or classes which are now competing for the favour
of the postal authorities.
Needle Telegraphs.—These have a visible needle in front of a
dial and two handles or levers worked by hand to give an
upright or a diagonal position to the needle. Each position ineans
something-a letter, a word,
or some symbol which is rendered
interpretable by a code of official language. In the body of the
case are coils of wire and other apparatus in ready communica-
tion with galvanic batteries. When the handles are moved the
needle moves also ; a galvanic current is excited which travels
through a telegraphic wire to any distant station and moves the
needle of a similar instrument at that station. Each clerk can
thus see the message sent by the other, for the message really con-
sists of certain visible movements of the needle. The needles at
the two stations show similar positions at any given instant when
at work, the one giving impulse to the other. The transmitting
clerk places the needle of his instrument in such successive posi-
tions, or subjects it to such movements, as will suffice to convey
a message ; while the receiving clerk at the other end of the line
watches the visible movements of the needle in front of his dial,
and reads the story of the message thus communicated. The

first instruments employed had two visible needles, but it is now
found that the simpler single-needle instrument is easier to use
and equally effective. The working of the needle instrument is
more easily learned by young hands than that of others presently
to be described, and is less liable to get out of order ; but there
are not such good means of detecting and correcting any mis-
takes that may be made in transmitting the message by it.
It is used in the Government telegraphs for many lines of
route.
Bell
, Telegraphs. In these there is a mode of arranging two
bells susceptible of being sounded by the electric current; these
bell sounds have a meaning given to them by a code-book
of signals. In the bell instrument a needle telegraph acts upon
two bells varying in tone placed on either side of the receiving
clerk's desk. The plan is said to admit of very rapid work, and
to be especially suitable for the transmission of press or news-
paper telegrams. The bell is sometimes used as a receiving
instrument with other systems besides that of the needle.
Recording Telegraphs.—The needle instrument leaves no record
of its handy work. It writes nothing, prints nothing. If the
receiving clerk fails to watch the movements of the needle he
learns nothing of the message sent. So, in like manner, the bell
instrument leaves no record; it sounds, but if those sounds are
not heard and interpreted at once the signalling is in vain.
Hence has arisen the conception of recording telegraphs to
produce a permanent record of each message, and the object
has been attained in a most ingenious way. The signals as
received at any distant station are permanently written by the
instrument itself, either in ordinary letters or in a special alpha-
bet of dots and dashes. Professor Morse's system is the one
most extensively adopted in various parts of the world, although
its use in England is comparatively of late introduction. The
dots and dashes are so selected that each group represents a
particular letter. For instance, e is expressed by a dot, t by a
lash, n by a dash and a dot, a by a dot and a dash, 6 by a
dash and three dots, &c. In this way, by arranging from one to
three dots and dashes and placing them in varied array, all the
letters of the alphabet can be symboled and many short useful
words besides. The dashes are about inch long, the so-called
dots are in reality shorter dashes, about ; inch in length. A
narrow strip or ribbon of paper is unwound and carried forward
by clockwork; an electro-magnet has a lever connected with an
inking apparatus which comes at intervals in contact with the
paper, leaving on it ink-marks which may be dots, short dashes,
or long dashes, according to the duration of the contact. By
placing the finger on a stud or key and playing, as it were, in
crotchets and quavers, the instrument .produces dashes and dots.
So generally useful is the Morse instrument found in practice
that it has been very extensively adopted by the Post Office ;
and still more so the Morse alphabet or code which may be em-
ployed with instruments of other kinds. Originally the dashes

a
and dots had the form of embossed un-inked indentations ; but it
is now usual to adopt the inking plan.
Printing Telegraphs.-Morse's instrument, and others which
have been invented, are usually called printing telegraphs; but
it would be more convenient to give them the name of recording
telegraphs, seeing that they only make embossed or coloured
marks as symbols. This would enable us to confine the name of
printing telegraphs to such as really print by means of inked
types. Professor Hughes, of New York, has invented a most inge--
nious apparatus for this purpose. There is a keyboard, something
like that of a miniature pianoforte, having as many keys as there
are letters, figures, and other symbols in the code en ployed. Move-
able pins are arranged vertically round a circular frame, which
revolves on a vertical axis, and clockwork keeps the frame rotating
while the pins are connected with the keys. A horizontal arm
sweeps round continuously a little above the circle of pins. The
letters, figures, and other symbols are engraved on the edge of a
wheel, which is driven by the same motion as the horizontal arm';
and the adjustment of the several parts is such that whenever
the arm passes over a pin the letter on the type wheel corre-
sponding with the key of that pin comes just opposite a ribbon of
paper. If the finger be pressed on a key the corresponding
pin is raised and made to touch the under side of the horizontal
arm, which glides over it. So long as this contact continues an
electric current is in action; when the contact ceases the current
This beautiful instrument is largely used on the Conti-
nent and is rapidly coming into favour in England. The receiv--
ing instrument yields a really printed slip, in Roman type, which
is gummed on a blank form, and sent by messenger to the
addressee.
Automatic Telegraphs.-This name is given to many systems,
in which the instrument sends its own telegrams, after the mani-
pulator has made certain adjustments. Bain, Allen Bakewell,
Caselli, Bonelli, and other inventors have produced instruments
for this purpose, but Sir Charles Wheatstone's Automatic Tele-
graph is that to which the authorities are now paying most
attention. It certainly is a masterly contrivance. Dashes
and dots, as on Morse's plan, are perforated in a paper ribbon,
the dashes near one edge, and the dots near the other; or,
rather, all the perforations are as small as pinholes, their arrange-
ment denoting whetiier they are to be interpreted as dashes or
dots. In making these perforations three studs are pressed
down to make dots, dashes, or spaces by a kind of pneumatic
action. When the ribbon of paper is once prepared it is fed
into an instrument called the transmitter, which has an electro-
magnetic arrangement for sending the message to any distant
station ; or, more comprehensively, the perforated ribbon may
be made to pass through three transmitters in succession, sending
the same message through one wire to a distant spot, from which
three wires diverge to three different districts. The ribbon is
fed into one transmitter, which by clock movement draws it in at
ceases.

the rate of an ordinary message per minute, and flashes the
signals of the message to one of the three distant districts; the
ribbon passes into and through a second transmitter, which
.sends the message to a second district, and so on to a third.
The holes in the ribbon act, when in the transmitter, somewhat
in the same manner as those in the cards of a Jacquard loom. At
the receiving end inked or coloured dots and dashes on a ribbon
of paper are the result.
Great importance is attached to the
prospective capabilities of this system as by it one wire, say
from London to Birmingham, may be made to do threefold as
much work as on the ordinary plan.
There is also an invention of Sir Charles Wheatstone's, called
the A B C Telegraph, used to some extent in connection with the
Government system.
It must not be inferred that the above descriptions include all
the instruments used, nor all the improvements introduced, for
the system is in a perpetual course of development. The autho-
rities, not bound to use any particular instruments, are ready to
avail themselves of all real improvements; and hence inventors
are encouraged to exercise their best ability in the matter. No
less than 1,900 telegraphing instruments were made for the
Government in the first year of working, together with 15,000
galvanic batteries, 2,000 miles of wire covered with gutta-percha,
and 3,000 tons of galvanised iron wire-all in addition to the
supplies taken over from the Companies.
THE C'ENTPAL STATION AND ITS ARRANGEMENTS.
When the large and important additions to the General Post
Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand are completed the centre
of the telegraph business will be located there, but at
present the chief office is in Telegraph Street, a small opening on
the east side of Moorgate Street. Before the transfer of the lines
to the State there were three Central Telegraph Stations in
the City, viz., the Electric and International in Telegraph Street,
the British and Irish Magnetic in Threadneedle Street, and the
United Kingdom at Gresham House; since then the first has
superseded the other two. It is known to the employés by the
initials T. S., which, for brevity, we will likewise use. In the
basement of the building are steam-engines, air-pumps, galvanic
batteries, and store-rooms. On the ground floor are the sending-
out or delivery-room, the inspectors' office, the inspectors' dining-
room, the male clerks' dining room, the writing room for the
press, the surgery or medical attendant's room the “intelligence”
room, the messengers' room, and the engineers' workshops. In
the press room and the intelligence room every facility is afforded
for the transmission of telegrams to the country newspapers,
under a system described in a later paragraph. On the first floor
are the superintendent's office, the engineer's office, the dining-
room and kitchen for the female clerks, the matron's room, and
chief of all, the metropolitan gallery. The second and third
a

93
floors contain other rooms and galleries for the receipt and trans-
mission of telegrams. This station or office is chiefly for the
transmission of messages to all parts of the United Kingdom,
but it also receives messages for delivery within a certain
limited district around. It is practically a place for re-trans-
mission. If a telegram had to be sent from Chelsea or South-
wark to Birmingham it would be transmitted to T. S. and
thence re-transmitted to Birmingham. So also from Dover or
Brighton to Manchester or Liverpool, and the like, modified as
additional wires are laid down.
At the Central Office all the papers on which the messages
are written for transmission to various parts of the United
Kingdom are thrown promiscuously upon sorting-tables, whence,
when the sorters have separated them according to districts, they
are carried to the instrument tables. This carrying used to be
done by messengers or porters, but an ingenious improvement in
the matter has recently been introduced. Carrier tapes or end-
less bands run over metal pulleys, so arranged that couplets of
tapes run parallel in the same direction in such a way as to
hold the telegram papers between them. The junction of two
sets of pulleys forms a natural inlet for these papers, which are
drawn in rapidly as soon as they are placed edgewise towards it.
Much time, expense, and confusion are saved by this ingenious
plan. When the papers reach the instrument tables the clerks
at once translate the written words into telegraphic symbols or
signals, which are forth with flashed along the wires.
The Metropolitan Gallery, as it is called at T. S., is devoted to
local telegrams, those which are sent from one part of the metro-
polis to another. There are distinct and separate wires from all
the postal district or head district offices to this gallery, where
nearly two hundred instruments, chiefly Needle, are employed.
There are now nearly four hundred telegraph offices in the me-
tropolis, mostly post offices; and the metropolitan gallery at T. S.
is made the medium of communication between them all. Long
rows of tables cross the gallery, at which sit the young women
telegraphers, each with an instrument before her and the name
of a circuit which that instrument accommodates. When the
telegrams are collected from the London Postal Districts, they
are sorted ; those for the country are sent to the Provincial Gal-
lery, while those for town are further sorted into districts. Some
of the telegraph wires in the metropolis are enclosed in tubes or
troughs underground, but the majority are of the over-house
kind which are familiarly known in most parts of London. The
underground wires are of copper, embedded in gutta-percha, and
wrapped round with tarred hemp.
The Provincial Gallery just mentioned is more important
than the Metropolitan, as within it are managed the trans-
mission and receipt of telegrams to and from all parts of the
United Kingdom outside the metropolis. In reference to the
outgoing telegrams the papers on which the messages are written
are given to the clerks, each of whom manages a telegraphing

instrument connected with a wire or group of wires arranged
according to districts. There are more than three hundred circuits
or lines of wire brought into the gallery, placed topographically,
each region or district distinct from the others. Several different
circuits go from London to Liverpool by different routes, the
termini of all of these being in the same part of the gallery ; and
so with other large and important towns, two or more circuits ac-
commodate each of them. The clerks in charge can see at a
glance whether the wires serving a particular district are all
equally busy, and can make arrangements for feeding them all
equally with messages. There are more than 150 instruments in
the gallery to send and receive messages ; the most numerous are
those on the Morse principle, the others being Needle, Hughes,
Bell, and Wheatstone. There are 60 miles of wire to connect
the instruments in this gallery with the galvanic batteries which
are placed beneath. There is also a test box through which
many hundreds of wires pass coming from all parts of the
kingdom ; each wire has a number attached to it and each
is tested every day by means of delicate galvanometers, which
will detect not only any fault or defect of insulation in the
wire but the locality where it occurs.
TIE PNEUMATIC DISPATCH TUBES.
The Pneumatic Dispatch is likely to be an important adjunct
to the telegraph system. As originally planned the dispatch
was for the conveyance of parcels and bags of letters. A large
iron tube, three or four feet in diameter, was laid under the
carriage-way from Euston Station to the General Post Office, viâ
Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, and Newgate Street, but it
has not yet to any great extent been rendered practically avail-
able, although a tube, somewhat smaller in diameter, is in use
between the Euston Station and the N. W. District Post Office
in Eversholt Street, a few hundred yards off. On the intended
system, whenever fully carried out, the parcels and mail bags
will be put into an iron carriage, the wheels of which run on two
rails laid along the bottom of the interior of the tube ; a steam
engine will pump a portion of the air out of that part of the
tube which is in front of the carriage and by virtue of the
partial vacuum thus created the carriage will be sucked along.
So far as regards the prospective working of the Pneu-
matic Dispatch as a kind of Metropolitan Parcels' Conveyance
system we have no concern here, but it has suggested an
arrangement singularly convenient for the requirements of
telegraphy. Tubes of small diameter are in use by the post-
office authorities--not for the conveyance of letters, post-cards,
newspapers, book-packets, samples, or money orders—but for
carrying the sheets of paper on which messages are written.
If a message is directed (say) from Fleet Stiat to Liverpool, it
is not flashed at once from the one place to the other because the
wires may not be so arranged as to permit of this. It is sent to
the central office at T. s, and thence transmitted by electric

agency to Liverpool. Now there might be two modes of sending
from the receiving office in Fleet Street to T. S.-by signalling
the telegrams along local wires, or by sending the written papers
by foot messengers. In practice a better mode than either of
these is gradually being adopted. Small pneumatic tubes under-
lie many of the streets of London ; seven of these were at work
before the transfer of the telegraphs to the State, and many
more have been laid down since. They connect the great station
in T. S. with the General Post Office in St. Martin's-le-Grand
and with receiving offices in Fenchurch Street, Leadenhall Street,
Threadneedle Street, Cornhill, Old Broad Street, Founders'
Court, Fleet Street, Charing Cross, the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's,
the Baltic Coffee House, Gresham House, &c. On the adjust-
ments being properly made a partial vacuum is produced
in the tube and a small roll of written messages is sucked along.
A little consideration will render the usefulness of this plan
evident. The tubes are employed mainly to connect the central
station with certain other London stations which collect and
deliver more messages than could be conveniently transmitted by
wire. One, for instance, goes to the Stock Exchange, which it
would be impossible to serve properly in any other way, the
messages being important as well as numerous, crowded into
the busy hours of the day, and liable to sudden augmenta-
tion on any change in the Money Market, declaration of a
new rate of discount, or political crisis. Several
messages,
each written on a sheet of paper, are put into a little carriage
called a carrier, and blown or sucked through the tube by
Mr. Latimer Clark's pneumatic apparatus. Similar tubes are in
use at Dublin, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, and a few other
large towns.
A beautiful improvement on this system has been introduced
by Messrs. Siemens and Halske; it has been at work in Berlin
for three or four years, but was not adopted in London till the
beginning of 1871. To understand its nature and purpose we
must bear in mind that, on the old or Latimer Clark system,
each tube can render only one kind of service, such as conveying
telegrams from the Stock Exchange to T. S., without any inter-
mediate stoppage. But, in any extension of the system, it would
be desirable that the same tube should serve three or more
stations; and then the question arises, how to make the little
carriage stop at the proper places, and give up the papers
destined for those places ? Messrs. Siemens and Halske have
solved this problem by an adoption, or rather imitation, of the
railway block-system. The carriers or carriages are thin
cylinders, nearly fitting the tube, which is about 2 inches in
diameter. The carrier is blown along the tube at the rate of
thirty miles an hour ; an air-pump at one end makes a partial
vacuum or plenum, according as rarefied air or compressed air is
to be employed ; while the friction of a ring of brushes, and the
check of an India-rubber buffer, bring the carrier to a stop at
the other end. But the arrangement at any intermediate

station is the most remarkable. Let us suppose a tube from
T. S. to Charing Cross, with intermediate stations at St.
Martin's-le-Grand and Fleet Street. At each of the intermediate
stations are two small pieces of tube, the transmitter and the
receiver, each equal in internal diameter to the pneumatic tube ;
they are of equal length, and a piece is cut out of the tube equal
to that length. By the action of a simple lever the transmitter
and the receiver may in turn be brought into a right line with
the tube, so as to form part of it. The transmitter is open
throughout, but the receiver is partially closed at one end.
When T. s. is about to send a carrier-full of message papers to
Charing Cross, signals are sent to St. Martin's-le-Grand and
Fleet Street to keep the line clear. The transmitters are put in
a line with the tube and the pneumatic curreut blows along the
carrier to Charing Cross without any intermediate stoppage.
When, however, the messages are intended (say) for the Fleet
Street Station, a signal to that effect is sent from T. S., and Fleet
Street puts the receiver instead of the transmitter into the line of
route. "The carrier, in its rapid journey, is arrested at that point
by the partially-closed end of the receiver ; a click is heard ; an
operator draws the receiver aside, takes the messages out of the
carrier, and places the transmitter in the line of route, ready for
another plenum or vacuum. In practice, the carrier is usually
(to use a railway analogy) a stopping train ; it stops at both the
intermediate stations, where it is opened, some papers taken out,
others put in, and then it is sent on again. In order properly to
work this ingenious system the basement story at the central
station is provided with a steam-engine, air-pumps, forcing-pumps,
and vessels for compressed air. When a cylinder or carrier full of
messages is to be sent a signal is touched which rings a bell at
the receiving station, Fleet Street, or elsewhere; the carrier is
put into the tube, compressed air is laid on, and the carrier is
driven swiftly on its journey. When, on the other hand, it is
known that messages are about to be sent to T. S., rarefied air
instead of compressed air is laid on and the carrier is drawn by
suction. To use a rough simile in the one case the carrier is
pushed behind, in the other pulled in front, although in both
cases the moving force is simply the difference between two
hodies of air slightly unequal in density.
VARIETIES OF TELEGRAM.
Among the various kinds of telegram entrusted to the Post-
master-General for transmission not the least important or
interesting are those connected with the newspaper press, for
which the
proprietors are willing to pay handsomely, The Post
Office authorities do not undertake the business of collecting
news and transmitting it to the newspapers.
This work is
thrown open to all who choose to undertake it; and the Post
Office gives equal facilities to all. The two principal bodies
who take up this enterprise are the “Press Association,” and

a
the Central Press.” When the telegraphs were in the hands
of the companies they transmitted Press news to 144 towns,
for 306 subscribers ; at the beginning of 1871 the Post Office
transmitted to 365 towns for 1,106 subscribers. In like
manner the number of newspapers supplied rose from 173 to
467 by the transfer from the companies to the Government. Once
more, in the twelve months before the transfer, the companies
transmitted about 6,000 words of news daily during the session
of Parliament, and at other periods of the year about 4,000 ;
whereas in the twelve months after the transfer, the Post Office
transmitted 20,000 words of news daily during the session, and
15,000 on other days. The ordinary correspondents of news-
papers, in addition, hand in something like 20,000 words per
day for transmission. Several newspapers pay £500 a-year
each for the exclusive use of one wire each during the night
hours. The way in which news is sent off during the night
to the country newspapers is nearly as follows. Suppose sheets
of manuscript, written out in English from a short-hand writer's
notes of a debate in the House of Commons, to be sent to the
telegraph office at Charing Cross or at Fleet Street. They are coiled
up into a roll, and sent through the pneumatic tube to T. S.
If Wheatstone's system is adopted three clerks punch holes in
three strips of paper, the holes representing the letters and words
of the message. The strip passes through a Wheatstone trans-
mitter, and almost at that very instant copies of the message are
reproduced on strips in receiving instruments at distant towns.
The original strip passes through a second transmitter, and the
message is reproduced at other towns; then through a third,
and the message re-appears at still other towns. In this
way,
news can be sent to perhaps a dozen towns at once; the original
strip passes through all the three transmitters without a band or
finger being applied to it. The received message is written out
in manifold, and sent to two or more newspapers in the same
town.
One peculiar growth of recent years is the racing telegram-
the transmission of short messages relating to horse-races, boat-
races, and the like.
This business is said to be large and
lucrative but troublesome on account of the eagerness and
excitability of the persons who bring the telegrams for trans-
mission. The race meetings in 1870 supplied 114,779 telegrams,
of which 12,784 were for the newspapers, and the remaining
100,000 or so for private individuals. Newmarket supplied
one-third of the whole number. On the day when the Cæare-
witch race was run nearly a thousand messages were taken in at
the Newmarket Telegraph Office in three hours, and dispatched
to their destination along the wires, and 800 in two hours on
another day in the same week. The Doncaster Meeting, how-
ever, produced the largest number of telegrams on any one day ;
2,000 were dispatched on the St. Leger Day, of which 500 were
taken in at the Grand Stand and cleared off within an hour
and a half. Epsom, though attracting a larger number of visitors

than any other race, only sent 5,890 telegrams during both meet-
ings; the class of persons assembliug there, and the vicinity of
the place to London, rendered the telegraph at the spot of less
importance than at Newmarket, Doncaster, &c.
With reference to ordinary commercial telegrams, many
persons bring their messages to the offices ready written on
stamped paper. This plan, which saves time and trouble to
all concerned, is encouraged by the authorities, who are
willing to provide for large firms interleaved books of stamped
message-forms, with the name and address of the sender printed
on each form. This still further economises time. In like
manner, for delivering messages to the addressees time-saving
contrivances are one by one adopted.
When the messages
telegraphed from other stations are properly recorded on paper
in the Provincial and Metropolitan Galleries at T. S., the papers
pass down a pipe into a lower room, where they are put into
envelopes and sent by messengers to the houses or offices of
the addressees. If these addressees are good customers printed
addressed envelopes for each firm are kept in stock in the sending-
out room.
Besides the various machines, lines, and working arrangements
already named, the Government possess some thousands of miles
of wire leased to firms who have the exclusive use of one wire
each. A few of the great newspaper proprietors do this, although
it is more customary for two or more of them to club together.
There is one matter relating to the language of telegrams which
may be here adverted to, although it does not affect our home
stations so much as the long lines of route abroad. All the symbols
used, whether by the needle, the Morse, or other systems, are
translatable into language. The United Kingdom, the United
States, British America, and the English Colonies generally, use
the same tongue for commercial and literary purposes ; but on
the continent of Europe, in Asia, and in Africa, there is of course
great diversity. Cables underlie the sea from England to France ;
wires run through France and Italy to the northern shore of the
Mediterranean ; another cable passes across that sea to Egypt ;
then other wires to Suez, and another cable down the Red Sea to
India ; or the home cable touches the continent at Ostend or at
some port in Holland and connects with wires passing through
Germany, Hungary, Turkey, and Asia Minor ; or through Russia
and over the Caucasus to Persia, whence a cable stretches
down the Persian Gulf towards India. In passing from one
country to another changes of language and of dialect frequently
occur; and unless the telegraph clerks are careful at their work
mistakes in the telegrams are very likely to arise. If a message
could be at once flashed to its destination misconstruction of
its meaning would be less likely ; but in practice, on long lines
comprising cables as well as wires, the message is repeated two
or more times. A Russian, a Turk, a Persian may all be con-
cerned in transmitting one telegram; and as neither one knows
the language of the other, an erroneous interpretation of the

dash and dot symbols may easily arise. Ludicrous examples of
enigmatical telegrams occasionally present themselves. At the
end of 1869 and the beginning of 1870 telegrams from England
to India passed through Russia and Persia, and many of them
reached their destination in a state of distortion hardly con-
ceivable. The ‘Bombay Gazette' and the Sydney Morning
Herald’ gave the following as examples of the form in which
telegrams, sent from London on various dates in December, 1869,
reached India and Australia :-“ London, 17th.--Alderman

A Londoner, knowing something of the European topics of public
talk and newspaper writing at that time, may form a slight guess
at the probable meaning of parts, at any rate, of this conglome-
ration ; but in a distant hemisphere it was of course a hopeless
;
muddle. Even in England, however, blunders occur, sometimes
vexatious, sometimes only ludicrous. Mr. Scudamore narrates
a few instances that have come under his notice since the transfer
of the telegraphs to the Government. A gentleman telegraphed
from London to his brother in the country to send a hack to the
station ; the signal for h is four dots, and for s three dots; the
telegraph clerk made three dots instead of four, and the gentle-
man found a sack instead of a hack awaiting him. A firm in
London telegraphed send rails ten foot lengths ; now a dash and
a dot signify te, but two dots signify i; the clerk made two dots
instead of a dash and a dot, and the message appeared in the
form send rui's in foot lengths. Here the sender was partly to,
blame ; he should have put one more word in the message, send

rails in ten foot lengths; the context would have served to guard
the clerk against making a blunder.
THE TARIFF OF CHARGES.
>
The adoption of a uniform rate of charge for telegrams, without
regard to distance of transmission, was based on the same reason-
ing as that which, thirty years ago, led to a uniform postage rate
for letters. If the charge were made dependent on the distance,
there would be but very few telegrams sent between places two or
three hundred miles apart; the charge would be too high. But
a uniform tariff would encourage the use of the telegraph and
the shorter distances would help to pay for the longer. This
matter underwent full discussion in connection with the Act of
1869. Mr. Scudamore said to the Committee : “The inhabitants
of large towns will get a very considerable advantage out of our
system, even if they do not get it in the reduction of the rate for
town (local) messages. The inhabitants of large towns are not
engaged solely in telegraphing to each other, they telegraph to
all parts of the country; and they will obtain, in return for the
uniform rate which we impose upon them in the towns them-
selves, a very large reduction of rate on the messages they send
to distant parts of the country. Of these latter they send no
less a proportion, if not a larger proportion, than they do of
messages within the town.” Under the companies there was
one telegraph station to about 13,000 inhabitants; under the
Government system it was intended that there should be one to
every 6,000 inhabitants at the commencement, but the accom-
modation will be gradually increased so that eventually there
will be nearly three times as many telegraph offices as before,
greatly to the accommodation of the public in every way.
This could not well be accomplished unless a uniform tariff were
charged, so as to encourage telegraphing between distant towns.
which would be almost shut out from niutual communication if
the charges varied proportionately to the distances. By the Act
the rate is raised to one shilling for local telegrams, and lowered
to one shilling for those between distant towns. But the six-
penny or local messages were always few in number. The
ratio, in the last year of the Companies' management, was nearly
as follows:-160,000 at sixpence, 3,340,000 at a shilling, and
2,500,000 at more than a shilling ; so that the rise in tariff
will only apply to a very small fraction of the whole number.
Moreover the charge for porterage was higher under the old
system than under the new, insomuch that the nominally six-
penny telegram generally used to cost a shilling or more. In
point of fact, it was rarely possible under the Companies'
system, to reckon beforehand the cost of telegraphing. Each
Company held itself responsible only for the transmission of
messages over its own lines, while a telegram to a small or
remote town was almost sure to pass over the lines of more than
one Company. All sorts of tariffs were in force on various lines;

"
generally the shorter the line, the higher proportionately the
rate of charge. Thus, a message to Granton cost Zs., viz., 2s. from
London to Edinburgh (400 miles), and 1s. for the four miles thence
to Granton. In like manner 3s. to Bournemouth, viz., ls. from
London to Poole, and 2s. for the seven miles thence to Bourne-
mouth. To Ireland the charge varied from 3s. to 6s. for twenty
words, 4s. 6d. to the Isle of Man, 7s. to Jersey or Guernsey.
There were 475 telegraph stations at which “extra” charges were
incurred ; besides 460 railway stations at which a charge of 6d.
was levied as the station-master's fee. The charges were not
only large and unequal, they were difficult to reckon. They
were sometimes levied partly on the sender of the message and
partly on the receiver, and time and trouble were wasted by
the clerks in calculating them. A uniform rate would therefore
save money, time, and trouble, and it has been fixed at one
shilling. This shilling rate, however, was not and is not re-
garded as a permanent one. “I fully expect," said Mr. Scuda-
more,” that in the course of two or three years we shall have a
uniform charge of sixpence. I have very little doubt that we
could afford, if that were the only question, to commence with a
sixpenny rate at once. But that rate would bring an enormous
increase in the number of messages, and until we know accu-
rately what number of messages we can carry, and what business
we can do with the staff, we think we ought not bring that in-
crease of work upon us. This really is the only reason for not
charging a lower rate than a shilling.” An alternative was pro-
posed, to continue the charge of sixpence for local or town
messages and make one shilling the charge for a longer distance,
but it was eventually determined to adopt a uniform shilling
rate. The way to estimate the real cost of telegraphing is to
include porterage as well as the main charge ; if this be done it
will be found that the public already benefit by the transfer of
the lines from the Companies to the State. The average cost to
the public of all telegrams, long and short, distant and near,
including porterage, was ls. 7d. under the old system ; it is only
1s. ld. under the new. But we learn, from a statement made to
the House of Commons by the Postmaster-General, in August
last (1871), that the Government only await the enlargement of
their premises, and the augmentation of their staff and working
plant, to adopt a uniform sixpenny rate, to commence some time
in 1872, thus fully bearing out the implied promise made by
Mr. Scudamore.
THE CAPITAL AND WORKING ACCOUNT.
Numerous other details concerning the practical management of
the system would doubtless be interesting but the foregoing pages
will suffice to convey a general notion of the subject. The tele-
graphs have not yet been in the hands of the Government for a
sufficiently long period to test either the amount of trade or the
balance of profit. There are, however, items of official information

made public from time to time, bearing in various ways on these
two questions.
At the end of June last, the National Debt Commissioners had
placed in the hands of the Postmaster-General a sum almost exactly
amounting to 7,000,000l. The sum paid in purchases of existing
interests, at that time, amounted in round numbers to 6,380,0001.,
and in extensions or new works to 620,0001. Mr. Scudamore an-
nounced that, in addition, a clear half million sterling would be
required to complete arrangements already planned, viz., about
235,000l. for further purchases from companies, and 285,0001. for
further extensions. The working of the telegraphs, therefore, after
paying all salaries and annual expenses of every kind, ought to
leave a net surplus sutlicient to pay a due interest on 7,500,0001.
If it does this, and something more, the nation will decide whether
to pay off the borrowed money by a sinking-fund, or to apply the
residue to State purposes, as has always been done with the residue
of the Post Office receipts. At any rate, strenuous endeavours will
be made to insure that the system shall fully pay itself, without
imposing any burthen on the taxpayers.
From the very nature of the powers intrusted to the Postmaster-
General by the legislature, in regard to the acquisition of telegra-
phic property, the system grows in magnitude every month. In
the autumn of the present year (1871), agreements were in force
with twenty-two railway and canal companies for the purchase
of their telegraph interests; viz., (in England), the Bristol and
Exeter, Bristol and Portishead, Furness, Great Western, London
and North-Western, North Staffordshire, and South-Eastern
Railways, with the Grand Junction and the Bridgwater Canals;
(in Wales), the Glyn Corrwg, Llanelly, Pembroke and Tenby,
Rhymney, Swansea Vale, and Taff Vale Railways; (in Scotland,)
the Caledonian, Glasgow and South-Western, Great North of
Scotland, North British, and Sutherland Railways ; (in Ire-
land), the Belfast and Northern Counties, and the Carrickfergus
and Larne Railways. The compensation to fifteen of these com-
panies is partly in cash paid down, partly in annual payments;
the other seven companies receive their compensation wholly in
annual payments. At the same period negotiations were in pro-
gress with other companies, but the terms of compensation were
not yet agreed upon; this group comprised the Midland, the
Great Northern, the Great Eastern, the London and South-
Western, the Chatham and Dover, the North London, the Metro-
politan and
Metropolitan District, the Lancashire and Yorkshire,
the North-Eastern, the Midland Great Western of Ireland, the
Dingwall and Skye, and about thirty small companies in various
parts of the United Kingdom. There were also new works in
course of execution to extend the telegraph system irrespective of
any of the companies,—by a submarine cable to Jersey and
Guernsey ; a submarine cable to the Isle of Man ; a new seven-
wire cable between England and Ireland ; new shore-ends for the
cable between Haverfordwest and Wexford ; a twelve-wire line
to Beachey Head (six to connect with the cable from Beachey Head

to the French coast); additional circuits to connect the great towns
of the kingdom; and various reconstructions and reinsulations of
existing lines.
In the seventeenth Annual Report of the Postmaster-General,
relating to the operations of the year 1870 (although not pub-
lished till August 1871) a table is given, showing the number of
messages (exclusive of press or newspaper messages) forwarded
from postal telegraph stations weekly. It commences with Feb-
ruary 5th, 187, (the day on which the transfer to the Govern-
ment took place), to the end of the year. The figures refer to the
weeks ending on the days named :-

The total amounted to 8,606,732; giving a weekly average of

ceptional weeks, producing more than the usual average about
that period, were those ending June 4 (Epsom Races), June 18
(Ascot Races), July 16, 23, and 30 (War panic), September 17
(Doncaster Races), October 15, 22, and 29 (Newmarket Races),
November 19 (Stock Exchange panic). Smaller than the usual
average were the weeks ending April 16 (Good Friday week),
and December 31 (Christmas week).
A remarkable proof has been afforded of the increased tendency
of the public to avail themselves of telegraphic aid when the
means of so doing are brought almost to their doors. At the
beginning of 1871, there were nearly as many railway telegraph
offices as postal telegraph offices in the United Kingdom, about
1820 to 1960; and yet nearly ten times as many telegrams were
sent through the latter as through the former : mainly, it is be-
lieved, because the post offices are so conveniently placed in the
busiest parts of most towns.
It is not yet certain whether we shall have the accounts of this
important department of the Post Office presented to us at the
end of each calendar year, or at the end of each financial year

(March 31st); possibly it may be in both forms, to serve
various Parliamentary and official purposes. One account, pre-
sented in June last, comprises the period from February 5th,
1870, when the lines passed into the hands of the Government,
to March 31st, 1871, a little less than fourteen months. In that
period the receipts amounted to 1,068,5851. for conveyance of
messages, private wire rental, special wires, signalling time cur-
rents, and miscellaneous sources. But as some of this money was
received in respect of collection on behalf of the Submarine Tele-
graph Companies, and had to be refunded to them, and as there
were other drawbacks and allowances of various kinds to be
made, the 1,068,585l. had to be lessened by 270,0051., leaving
798,5801. as the real sum received in regard to the land-wires
under the control of the Government. The working expense
for earning this sum was 470,0001., made up of salaries, wages,
stationery, rent, rates and taxes, fuel and light, way leaves, pole
rents, engineering, maintenance of plant, and miscellaneous
charges. Mr. Scudamore claims that these figures justify the
opinion that he has from time to time expressed concerning the
eventual profitableness of the telegraphs under Government
manag nent. In July, 1869, in a paper addressed to the Mar-
quis of Hartington, he estimated the telegraph revenue, in the
first year, at 673,838l. ; this agrees very closely with the ascer-
tained fact—798,5851., for fourteen months, being a trifle in
excess of 673,8381. for twelve months. Again, in January, 1871,
when the fourteen months were about three-fourths expired, he
said, “I shall be able to show that the department is on the
very eve of fulfilling all its promises to Parliament and the
public; and that if its progress up to the present time has not
appeared to keep pace with the expectations of the public, it has
been, at least, as rapid as the circumstances in which we have
been placed would permit
. I shall be able, however, to show
that, even in the first year of our operations, we shall very
nearly obtain, if we do not actually obtain, the estimated gross
annual revenue; that this gross annual revenue must inevitably
grow larger from year to year; that though, in the first year of
our operations, our estimates for cost of construction, re-construc-
tion, and maintenance, will, for reasons to be described, be ex-
ceeded, the normal proportion of expenditure to revenue will
not hereafter differ from that given in previous estimates; and
that the financial results of the
completed scheme will not be less
favourable than those which I have all along predicted for it.”
Mr. Scudamore, in June, 1871, drew attention to the fact that
his anticipations of July, 1869, and January, 1871, had been
virtually realized, so far as concerns the gross earnings of the
lines. The working expenses had been higher than he expected.
This he accounted for “because we have made extensions of our
scheme which we did not contemplate when the estimate was
made; and because at the outset of our operations, when a large
portion of the staff were but imperfectly trained, a more than
normal cost had to be incurred, in order to provide adequately for

the work.” As, moreover, the gross receipts of 1871 have been
25 to 35 per cent. more than those of the corresponding weeks
of 1870, with only a relatively small increase in the working
expenses,
it
may
be fairly stated that the net profits are steadily
increasing. In round numbers it was calculated that in the first
fourteen months the telegraphs earned a good 10 per cent. on a
capital expenditure of 7,500,000, leaving, at 58 per cent. working
expenses, enough net profit to pay interest; hence the hope and
belief that the system will yield a surplus by and bye.
GEORGE DODD.
THE LARGEST BOOK IN THE WORLD.
NOTES ON THE SPECIFICATION OF BRITISH PATENTS 1617–1869.
IF the most learned bibliomaniac were asked what was the
largest book ever published the chances are very great that his
answer would be erroneous. Living amongst the tomes of
ancient days, dreaming of “Wynkyn's unique, and Caxton's
uncut,” the question would probably bring to his memory that
monument of Dutch perseverance, the “ Galerie Agreéable du
Monde," of P. van der Aa, which extends to sixty-six large folio
volumes, or that wonderful Companion to the Almanac which
Bollandus commenced in 1643, and which has even now only
dragged its slow length along to the month of October although
it fills fifty-six volumes. Some periodicals might occur to
him. A set of the “London Gazette” from 1667, to the
present time makes a moderately imposing show, and the
Gentleman's Magazine," with its 233 volumes, is by no means
to be despised. But it is not likely that the bibliomaniac
would be able to give a correct answer, for the book belongs
too much to the workaday world to have fallen under his
notice. The largest literary attempt the world has so far seen,
is the “Specifications of Patents for Invention,” published by
the authority of the Commissioners of Patents, and under the
editorial care of Mr. Bennet Woodcroft, F.R.S. This work
is still in course of publication, and about ten fasciculi of it
appear every day, or between three and four thousand each year.
Each specification forms a pamphlet stitched in a blue paper
cover, varying in thickness according to the length of the descrip-
tion of the invention, and to the number of engravings with
which it is illustrated. Some consist of a single leaf enclosed in
the blue covers, others are as large as a good sized volume. The
largest is that taken out by Thomas Dunn in 1862 (No. 751).
The description of this invention for 'Improvements in the
Construction of Bridges, Roofs, Houses, and other structures'
fills thirty-six pages, and is illustrated by 104 large folio sheets
of drawings, forming when bound four good sized volumes.

The Largest Book in the World.
250 copies are printed of each specification ; this particular one
entailed the payment to printers and lithographers of £423.
The total number of specifications (from A.D. 1617 to December
31, 1870), is 72,586. When bound they make 2,533 thick
volumes of an imperial octavo size. The cost of purchasing a
set (and they are sold at about cost price) would be 2,4481. A
work of this extent would manifestly be useless without indexes.
Mr. Woodcroft has supplied it with the necessary apparatus, in
the shape of chronological, alphabetical, subject matter, and other
indexes extending to sixty volumes. These keys will enable
the searcher to discover any patent he may wish to see if he
knows its subject, the name of the patentee, or the date when it
was taken out.
Recently the Commissioners have added to their publications
a weekly 'Chronological and Descriptive Index,' in which abridg-
ments of specifications are printed as fast as the term of secrecy
expires, together with continuous indexes of persons and subjects.
This is perhaps the most important of all their publications, for it
contains the latest record of all improvements. By its use,
the inventor may learn whether some more fortunate individual
has already anticipated his discovery, and the intelligent manu-
facturer on the look out for improved processes may see what
the inventive talent of the country has to offer him. This
index is the result of a suggestion of Peter Spence, Esq., F.C.S.,
who, in a memorial which received the signatures of some of the
most eminent scientific men and manufacturers of the day,
pointed out the advantages likely to arise from the public having
immediate access to these specifications, formerly almost in-
accessible, since the Subject-Matter Index, without which they
wildering maze,” was always six to eighteen months in
It is to be regretted that it was thought necessary to create a
special serial for these abridgments instead of inserting them in
"The Commissioners of Patents' Journal,' which is published
twice a week and contains notices of applications for letters
patent, and of the various stages through which the patent has
to pass. Thus the Patent Office has now virtually three organs
per week, and the manufacturer who would be “well posted”
must of necessity go through every issue. When, in addition to
this, it is remembered that there are no regulations whatever to
control patentees in drawing up the abridgments, and that con-
sequently large numbers of them are entirely worthless, it will
be evident how seriously the utility of the new weekly index is
impaired. The Commissioners' Journal, as a weekly issue com-
bining the three present publications, mig! it, we think, be made
to contribute in no mean degree to the increase of technical know-
ledge, and the willingness which the Commissioners have so far
exhibited to listen to outside suggestions for improvements makes
it the more incumbent on all who have studied the subject to offer
them. The Patent Office has a large revenue arising from a tax
on iuvention ; there is, therefore, a fair claim that any surplus
are a
arrear.

should be devoted to the increase and diffusion of technical know-
ledge.
Copies of the British Patent Office publications are liberally
distributed to Foreign and Colonial Governments, and similar
works are received in return. The titles of these foreign
patents are printed in the “Journal,” but of what use is a bare
title? Noblesse oblige. From those who have already done so
well, we desire still more. All these foreign specifications should
be translated, and in an abridged forni, printed in the Commis-
sioners' 'Journal.' This should also contain abridgments of all
British patents, and full indexes which would render it possible
to dispense entirely with the publication of the indexes now issued
in separate and costly volumes. The Commissioners' “Journal'
would then become the most important technological publication
in existence, and would be a guide to the inventions and im-
provements in the industrial arts throughout the civilized world.
We do not here pronounce any opinion as to the advantages of
the appointment of “Scientific Examiners of Patents” in common
with a largely reduced scale of fees, recommended in so many
quarters as a remedy for the gravest evils of our existing
system; but, assuredly, we think no agency could be so valuable,
as the comprehensive epitome we have described, in educating
the British manufacturer and informing the intending patentee
as to the relative novelty and value of his claim.
The indexes having become so numerous and costly as to
render their purchase inconvenient or impossible to many persons
who would desire to possess them, it was decided to issue
abridgments of the specifications, arranged in distinct classes and
capable of being compressed into one or two duodecimo volumes.
This series is one of the happiest ideas of the Commissioners.
The volumes are compact, handy, and cheap. Some of them
contain brief introductions, in which the history and archæology
of the subject are set forth, not indeed, with any great amount
of independent research, but intelligibly and intelligently,
although the sources of the information are very obvious.
Our patent system, as such, dates from 1617, although a few
earlier ones exist. Since that date nearly all the important, and
very many of the unimportant, changes in every department of
technology, have been the subject of one or more patents.
Most important documents illustrative of industrial progress are
included in the series.
Industries which have arisen since the reign of James I (and,
thanks to steam, electricity, &c., they are numerous) have almost
their entire history recorded in these blue books, and of those
trades which were already flourishing when the Scottish Solomon
ascended the throne, the record, if less complete, is equally
curious and interesting. Whenever the real history of Great
Britain comes to be written, the record of the daily workaday
life of the people, of the succession of endeavour, failure, and
success, which has gradually raised them from the rude insig-
nificance of the past to the power and civilization of to-day-will

a
have to be gathered in a great measure from the work of which
we are now speaking. It covers the most brilliant period of our
commercial and manufacturing career, and is a record of British
inventive genius for more than two centuries.
The chronicle is not unblurred, folly often and knavery some-
times have found a place upon it. Yet on the whole it is a
record of which we may be proud. It bears testimony to many
years of honourable toil, of undaunted perseverance, of wrestling
with nature for the possession of her secrets, and the result we
have in the thousand appliances for the ease and comfort of man
which make up the material side of our civilization. Writers
in former volumes of the 'Companion to the Almanac' have ex-
plained the British system of patents, and we have no intention
of again going over that well-worn ground. Our purpose is
much more limited, and it is only necessary for us to say that
under the old Patent Law, which was not amended until 1852, a
single patent might cover a number of distinct inventions, and
that although under the amended law the patent covers only
one invention, yet that invention may be applicable to a number
of distinct purposes.
In the following tabular statement we adopt the classification
used in the subject matter Index, and show the number taken
out under the old law, a period of 235 years ; the number taken
out under the new law to the end of 1869, a period of 17 years,
and finally the total number of patents applicable to each class.

Mr. Woodcroft has introduced changes into his own classification
which sometimes prevent comparison between the two periods ;
still an examination of these tables will reveal some curious facts.
The relative numerical proportion of the different classes is not
without interest, as it shows, to some extent at least, the nature
of the problems which have most excited the atteution of inven-
tors. It is perhaps also a test by which the existence of knotty
problems may be indicated.
With 1347 patents for the prevention of accidents there would
seem to be no necessity for the maiming and killing which is so
common in our streets, railways, and workshops.
Surely the “great unwashed” should, even though Ethiop
dark, have been made clean by 228 patent baths. It is a proverbial
assertion, not always realized, that new brooms sweep clean, but
here are no less than 291 patent brushes and brooms offered for
the matron's choice, and all of them warranted to have a furious
animus against dust and dirt.

With 495 patent buttons, surely the old difficulty under which
the Paterfamilias of “Punch ” so often laboured ought to have
become a thing of the past.
Forgery is chiefly guarded against in the patents for cheques
and bank-notes, one of the latest being an American device for
preventing alteration of values in monetary instruments. Mr.
Berolzheimer proposes to remove perforated portions of the
cheque in definite proportions, according to its amount.
Time-keepers of all classes, watches, clocks, &c., with their
usual appendages, are treated of in 620 specifications. In this
class we find a proposal for a revolution in our method of mea-
suring time. This invention (No. 2073 for 1869) for which a
patent was refused, belongs properly to the class of paradoxes
which the late lamented Professor de Morgan was so fond of
showing up. It is an attempt at squaring the circle.
The British public, we learn from another of these documents,
highly appreciates the performance of athletes, and prefers those
exhibitions which are attended with the greatest amount or
appearance of risk. This seems rather hard on the poor acrobat,
who daily carries his life in his hand, and risks it with a courage
which in a noble cause would be heroic. An inventor proposes
to sole him with iron and let him walk in safety head down-
ward on a brass ceiling connected with a powerful electro-
magnet. (No. 447, 1869.)
Ladies and pugilists will no doubt be grateful for the thought-
ful patentees who have devised 141 inventions relating to
gloves.
Fifteen patents aimed at the lives of “insects and vermin "
must carry terror into the ranks of the parasitic tribes, if they
are students of such rolls. What would a conference of flies
and field mice think about this branch of industry ?
“There is nothing like leather," says the old proverb, an asser-
tion which will not be endorsed by the makers of artificial
leather. 559 inventions for the real and artificial article show
its importance.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer will no doubt be interested
to learn that matches and fuzees, for which he has exhibited so
tender a regard as a means of increasing the revenue, have been
the occasion of 222 patents. Let us hope that the inventors have
been more successful than Mr. Lowe in deriving ex luce lucellum.
Six patents for voting apparatus are probably the result of the
discussion of the ballot question.
Firearms have scarcely progressed since their first introduc-
tion, or at all events only in recent years. It is equally notice-
able that many of the so-called new implements of destruction
are really old stagers, modified perhaps in detail, but substan-
tially the engines of two centuries back..
Drummond, of Hawthornden, had a comprehensive patent in
the reign of Charles (I for various military engines, and amongst
them was “a machine made, as it were, of musket barrels fas-
tened together, by the aid of which any single soldier may be

considered able to fill the place of a hundred musqueteers.”
This machine, he adds, “may from its effect be called åpua
Kepavvov, or lightning chariot,” in the vulgar tongue "fyerie
waggon.
Was Colt's six-shooter anticipated in Drummond's instrument,
by which a single man could be of no less avail in battle than
five or six with the ordinary weapons ?
The inventor speaks as if this engine were actually in use ; it
was called by different names as its size varied, although the prin-
ciples of its construction are unaltered. “Box-pistoll,” and “
kett-box,” are amongst the titles he gives.
The first English patent relating to fire-arms and accoutrements
is one for a new description of powder and shot flasks granted in
October, 1592. In 1607 the famous Marquis of Worcester had a
grant for making and working saltpetre and gunpowder in
England.
Puckle, the author of that curious book “The Club,” took out a
patent in 1717 for a portable gun or machine called “Defence,”
which consisted of a single barrel and a rotating chamber piece.
The chamber piece contained six or more divisions for charges, and
when exhausted it could be unscrewed and replaced by one fully
loaded. Puckle also provided means whereby round bullets might
be shot against Christians and square ones against the Turks.
In 1721 Isaac de la Chaumette invented a breech-loader, which
was cooled by charging and cleansed by firing.
Manton's name first occurs in 1792, in connection with an im-
proved hammer, the first of a long series of patents which have
made his name famous amongst gunners.
Howard's fulminating mercury was described to the Royal
Society in 1800, and in 1807 the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth
patented the percussion lock. His patent was unsuccessfully dis-
puted on the ground of prior use. Its private use by others
appears to have been proved, nevertheless his patent was sus-
tained.
In reading the details of some of Howard's experiments it seems
remarkable that this use of his discovery did not occur to him, yet
we find him remarking that it was pretty plain that no gun
could confine a quantity of the mercurial powder sufficient to pro-
ject a bullet with a greater force than an ordinary charge of gun-
powder."
Shrapnel shells, so named after their inventor, do not appear
until 1834.
In 1831, Moser took out the first English patent for the now
famous “needle” gun.
Reaping-machines early received the attention of the Commis-
sioners who issued the specifications relating to them before they
undertook the gigantic task of printing all the old law”.
fications. To this work was added an appendix by Mr. Wood-
croft, in which he sketched the history of "agricultural cutters,”
from the Egyptian sickle down to those patented in 1853.
The first notice of a “machine” for reaping is in Pliny. It

was an instance of the utility of sometimes putting the cart before
the horse, for it consisted of a van, somewhat resembling a modern
wheel-barrow, armed with projerting teeth in front, and worked
by an ox yoked in the shafts behind with his head turned to
wards the cart. Rude as was this “expeditious manner of reap-
ing,” as it is styled by Palladius, it fell into disuse in the middle
ages, being superseded by that symbol of Ceres which is almost
the oldest of agricultural instruments.
In 1780 the Society of Arts offered a prize, which led to the
reconsideration of the instrument just described, and to a dis-
cussion as to its adaptation to modern wants. The first English
patent for a corn-cutter was granted to Joseph Boyce in 1799.
The Rev. Peter Bell's invention was the first considerable im-
provement, and many of those now in use are based upon it.
An earlier one, invented but not patented by Henry Ogle, which
was also on the reciprocating and advancing system, had to be
abandoned, the labourers threatening to murder the man who had
manufactured this metal reaper. In most of these patents the
influence of the classical machine is easily perceptible. Even in
our own days of reaping by steam the use of the sickle is far
from being entirely superseded.
Perpetual Motion is a rock on which many mechanical geniuses
have been wrecked. It possesses an unaccountable charm for
some person who expend in the visionary search an amount of
patience, and often ingenuity, which turned in more common
sense directions would not fail of reward. The first English
patent for perpetual motion was granted in 1630 to David
Ramseye, for an invention whereby he hoped “to make
of mills to goe on standing waters, by continuall mocion, without
the helpe of winde, water, or horse.” No description accom-
panies the patent. That there are still would-be discoverers
of the secret may be gathered from the following verbatim copy
of an application received at the Patent Office in London :-
“Her Majesty the Queen Victoria,
Patent Office, London.
“ Your Majesty we humbly advertise that we find out the
Perpetual Motion’a machine very singular in its construction,
but the same time very important by the power it gives.
“We intend to secure ourselves the patent right for the United
States, and as we are informed your Majesty has secured a reward
for the inventor, we respectfully ask your Majesty if we may
come to show our invention ?
“To prevent mistake we humbly beg not to believe any person,
without having the original Patent of the United States, and the
copy of this Letter.
“Very respectfully,
“KRAUSE & ROTMAN.
“Milwaukee, Wisc, United States,
'January 28, 1859."

work on the Perpetuum Mobile, where many other curious
details of mechanical eccentricity may be found. The subject is
not yet exhausted. Miss Berry in 1784, went to the Palazzo
Altieri at Rome, where she saw a machine for perpetual motion,
with two balls. She adds “I understand its principle but can-
not describe it.” In the Memoirs of Peter Henry Bruce, we
read of a Mr. Slitter, an architect in the service of Peter I, who
killed himself by intense study in endeavouring to contrive a
perpetual motion. Bruce gives a description of the machine,
but less fortunate than Miss Berry, we find this, like many
other similar contrivances, to be simply incomprehensible. Not
the faintest shadow of real success has ever gladdened the
heart of the modern searcher after self-motive power. Thousands
of pounds and hundreds of years have been devoted to the
task, and no man has ever been able to accomplish it. The
results which the Marquis of Worcester expressly declares him-
self to have attained two centuries ago have never been realized
by any subsequent experimentalist. That perpetuum mobile is
impossible would perhaps be too much to say ; that it would be
a mere useless toy is much more certain. Our prime movers
have greater power than any perpetual motion ever dreamed.
The search, however, has not been wholly in vain, for those who
have flown su high have sometimes by chance hit upon humbler
devices calculated to be of public benefit.
Next to the search for the perpetual notion the study which
has been prosecuted with least success, perhaps, is that of
Aëronautics. A certain French politician and manufacturer,
notable for his views on the subject of Invention is of opinion
that the man who propounds a mechanical problem is the real
inventor and not the man who solves it. When once a person is
clever enough to find out that it would be a good thing to have
a machine to do some piece of work, the “next practical nian"
he meets will tell him how to make it. M. Schneider's practical
man is, like Macaulay's schoolboy, a marvel of cleverness, but
there is one question which he has not answered yet, and that is
“How can the air be navigated ?" Icarus thought himself a
practical man—with disastrous results. Equally unlucky was
Giovanni Battista Dante, an Italian, who about 1650 is said to
have lost his life in an attempt at mechanical flight near Perugia.
Aëronautics occupy one of the volumes of the Abridgments.
The slight historical sketch prefixed is by no means exhaustive
of the very curious topic of which it treats. Lana's invention is
not recorded, although it is one of the earliest efforts of the
kind.
The sixth chapter of his “Prodromo" (1670), is devoted to
describing how to “ Fabricare una naue, che camini sostentata
sopra l'aria a remi, e à vele ; quale si dimostra poter riuscire nella
prattica.” The author laments that his religious poverty had
not allowed him to try the experiment himself. Though quite
impracticable his plan has not been without adherents. *

None of our English patents belong to this pre-scientific
period, the first bearing date 1815, long after the ascents of
Pilatre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes had made clear
the possibility of rising in the world by means of balloons.
None of the various devices for aërial machines to act by
mechanical means have, so far, been successful. Viscount
Carlingford's anticipation that, " like the chariot of Jupiter,” bis
patent aërial chariot might hereafter be drawn by two trained eagles
has not yet come to pass. Wings and tails have so far been
found impracticable. Perhaps the most curious of the specifica-
tions relating to aërial conveyances is that of Mr. R. B. Boyman
(No. 3,262 for 1866), which is really a somewhat conprehensive
treatise on the state of aëronautical science at that date.
Mr. Boyman proposes that we should sail through the air in
a car, or saloon, dependent from a gaseous envelope of cylin-
drical shape, with conical bases, propelled by jets of steam
and hot air, acting in equivalent or other reaction tubes, and
steered by side rudders or reaction tubes. Notwithstanding the
elementary state of the art ballooning has been turned to
considerable practical use for scientific and military purposes.
Gambetta is probably the first dictator who dropped out of the
clouds. It may be hoped that the increased attention to the
study of air-navigation by the savants of France during the late
war will lead to many practical improvements. Ninety-one
patents for aërial navigation ! and still the poet's vision has not
been realized, that prophetic rapture wherein he-
“Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales."
Pins were not the subject of a patent before 1795, although
they appear to have been manufactured in England since 1543,
when their form and make was regulated by statute. The im-
portation of foreign pins was prohibited in 1483. No student of
political economy will forget Adam Smith's famous reference to
the advantage of the division of labour in the “trifling manu-
facture” of pins. The progress of invention has now made it
equally remarkable as an instance of the benefits of machinery,
for the hand-made pins are superseded by articles which,
with the exception of colouring and polishing, are made in one
machine. The first attempt at superseding hand labour was
made by Samuel Willman Wright, a native of Massachusetts,
who came to London and patented his invention in 1824. Owing
to the failure of the company by which they were to have been
it was not until 1833 that solid-headed pins were intro-
duced to the British public. It is somewhat singular to find that
in 1817 Seth Hunt patented a machine for making pins “ with a
head, shaft, and point in one entire piece.” This was a commu-
nication from a certain foreigner residing abroad.” Even the
placing of the pins on the sheets of paper in which they
are sold is performed by highly ingenious and complicated
machinery

Needles are of high antiquity, and are said to have been first
made here by a Spanish negro in the reign of Queen Mary. It
was not untii 1650 that the trade appears to have been thoroughly
naturalized. Christopher Greening is considered to be the proto-
needle maker of England. No patent relating to needles is
recorded before 1755. Thanks to the improvements of successive
inventors the manufacture has now attained a high degree of
perfection. The dry-grinding of needles is a most unhealthy
task, yet the grinders cannot be persuaded to use the simple con-
trivances which would protect them from the evil results of in-
haling the minute particles of steel thrown off in the process of
grinding The British workman prefers to have his lungs
riddled with steel filings rather than wear a magnetic wire
gauze net, which would add years to his life. And this whole-
sale suicide passes almost unnoticed in a country which prides
itself upon its Christianity. A German inventor is said to
have discovered a method of sharpening steel and wires by
means of the electric current. This, if correct, will sooner or
later put an end to Sheffield self-murder.
The medical patents are a curious class. The first was granted
to Thomas Grent for a moveable “hydraulike," which, being
placed by a bedside “causeth sweete sleepe to those which either
by hott feavers or otherwise cannot take rest.” A. musical box
appears to have been attachable to this instrument. Anästhetic
apparatus was not patented until 1846 ; in 1857 we have an
invention applicable to the embalming of bodies ; disinfectants
first appear in 1799. The first feeding-bottle seems to be that
of P. L. T. Thiers (1847); it was used in connection with a
breast pump, and not intended for the conveyance of prepared
food. Most of the feeding-bottles now in use are modifications
of that patented by Edward O'Connell in 1853. Some medical
patents have an air of eccentricity about them; there is one for
milking cows, and another for curing croup in fowls.
Richard Warren, in 1781, patented medicated gloves intended
to preserve the hands from chapping.
The first artificial leg was patented by Thomas Mann in 1790 ;
in 1800 James Potts protected an “artificial arm and leg upon a
new or improved construction” (the wording shows him to have
been a cautious man); in 1854 Auguste Boissonneau patented
some “improvements in artificial eyes.”
Some patents håve been granted of an obviously improper
character. The protection afforded by letters patent to deserving
inventions was surely never intended to apply to quack medi-
cines. It is gratifying to see that of late applications of this
kind have been refused.
Tobacco has been the subject of a good number of patents,
most of them relating to improvements in the machinery for its
preparation. The first in point of date is that of De la Chau-
mette, who, in 1721, protected “two snuff boxes, one with a
slider and the other with a sweep, out of which snuff may be
taken without pulling it out of the pockets and without spilling."

The second patent (1747) is for a tobacco-cutting machine; the
third (1749) is for a medicinal powder, consisting of tobacco and
other herbs pulverized ; one tablespoonful of this elegant mixture
“struck for a dose up the nose as snuff,” would according to the
solemnly expressed opinion of its inventor, one of the tribe of
Smith, cure various disorders of the “hypocondriac and melan-
choly kind.” A melancholy remedy, whatever the disease might
be. This is one of those few industries which a sincere lover of
his country would gladly dispense with. It is not pleasant to
contemplate the waste of time and money and health caused by
the increasing use of this narcotic poison. No invention can
possibly be patented to repair the ravages which the fatal habit
of smoking is inflicting upon the rising generation.
In few things are the differences between ancient and modern
civilization more striking than in the methods of obtaining arti-
ficial light. In the heroic ages torches of resinous wood seem to
have been the only means for conquering darkness, and the
highest perfection the Greek or Roman attained was the oil
lamp, with one or more wick-holes. These, from the imperfect
supply of oil to the wick and the amount of carbon lost as
smoke, must have been very poor affairs. Hero, of Alexandria,
about B.C. 150, invented a method for ensuring a steady
supply of oil to the wick by means of water. A modern
invention is that of Peter Keir, who in 1787 proposed to employ
for this purpose another fluid whose specific gravity is greater
than that of oil, and which “may by its weight be brought to act
upon and press upwards a column of oil.” The first real im-
provement in lamps is that for which Ami Argand obtained
letters patent in 1784. The Argand is now so familiar that one
can scarcely realize the fact that a hundred years ago it did
not exist. Thousands of years, the sons of Adam had used
vessels of light one degree only removed from the proto-lamp,
and yet this invention, beautiful in its simplicity, is a thing of
only yesterday. It is curious to find that in the year preceding
Argand's patent a M. J. I. Bouchet obtained one for a “lamp
or lantern which consumes less oil than those now in use, and
has the particular quality of producing neither smoke or smell.”
Unfortunately no specification of this invention was enrolled, so
that it cannot be compared with that of its successors.
Street lamps appear to have been unknown before the
Christian era. It was not until 1716 that London had public
lights, although long before that date householders had been
required to hang out lights on dark nights. When the century
was entering into its teens the metropolis was lighted with gas.
The lime light was used by Drummond in 1824, yet no patent
for it is found earlier than that of Gordon and Deville in 1835.
The Bude light dates from 1839, and consists, as is well known,
in inserting into the interior of the flame a jet of pure oxygen.
Magnesium, discovered in 1830, was not the subject of a patent
before 1864.

paper and magazine. It is a hydrocarbon found as a mineral in
Moldavia and Wallachia. In its natural state it is a dirty brown
colour, but is manufactured into candles beautifully white. Its
melting point is 140° F., which is higher than that of stearine,
and allows the use of a large wick. It is the brightest of all
artificial lights.
Failing space warns us to bring to a close these random notes
on industrial history drawn from the “Specifications of Patents.”
An examination of the table will abundantly show that there is
no branch of manufacture which has not contributed its quota
of ingenious devices to the patent roll. Nothing is too great for
the inventor to attempt, nothing is so small as to escape his
notice. His soul is not “above buttons,” yet he strives to fly up
into the blue sky, and hopes to yoke the bird of Jove to his
chariot-wheel, and to those who laugh at his extravagance he
can point out that he has already stolen the bolts of the Olympian
Thunderer.

THE CENSUS OF 1871.
a
A census to be of value must include much more information
than the mere numbers of the people. The earliest census of
which there is any record had regard mainly to the “fighting
men, and probably with savages of the present day, if they
number their people, the fighting men only are taken account of.
In Numbers, 1st chap., from the 17th to the 20th verses, there
is a reference to the first census ever taken, in so far as we know.
The direct command given to Moses certainly does not justify
the religious objections to census taking that are entertained by
a limited number of persons, for we are told that the Lord
commanded Moses to number the people, which he did “by their
generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
according to the number of the names, by their polls, every
male from twenty years old and upwards, all that were able to
go forth to war. The numbering of the people of the world
since the time of Moses has been loosely and irregularly con-
ducted. There is no evidence of any attempt at numbering the
people of any part of the United Kingdom prior to the com-
mencement of the present century. About the middle of the
last century an estimate of the population of Great Britain was
made, and the figures arrived at, in 1751, gave a population of
7,392,000. In the latter half of the last century emigration
commenced, and it was contended that the population was
decreasing. The result of this contention was that the first legal
census was taken under Mr. Pitt's administration in 1801. This

was the
year of the Union with Ireland, a year of famine and
of sanguinary war with France, which had the Northern Con-
federacy for its allies. In this first census, and in that which fol-
lowed in 1811, no account was taken of the ages of the popu-
lation. In 1821 ages were first taken, but the question of age
was purposely left optional ; even under this enquiry, however,
the ages of 8-9ths of the population were obtained. In 1831 the
number of males of 20 years and upwards was required ; in 1841
the names and ages of all the persons enumeratǝd were stated with
tolerable accuracy ; in 1851, these particulars were again required
r
from heads of families ; in 1861 and 1871 numerous additional
items of important information have been collected.
It is evidence of the lusty vigour of our trans-atlantic cousins
that they have already completed their ninth census, whereas the
eighth of the United Kingdom only has been taken. We learnt
from Washington, U.S., a few months since that a preliminary
report on the American census of 1870 was in the press, and
nearly ready for publication. The term preliminary is likely
to convey an erroneous impression, inasmuch as the forthcoming
report is an instalment of the whole returns, and complete in
itself in so far as it pronounces. It is embraced in a quarto
volume of about 300 pages, printed in double columns, without
“ leads." The three tables comprise :-1. The classes of popu-
lation by States, according to each of the nine censuses, from 1790
to 1870 inclusive ; 2, Classes of population by counties from the
nine censuses ; and 3, The population of all civil divisions smaller
than countries, and the proportion of white and coloured, native
and foreign-born population for the three censuses of 1850, 1860,
and 1870. The later volumes are to embrace statistics of agri-
culture, manufactures, mortality, and miscellanea. The classes of
population are divided into white, free-coloured, slave (so it is
reported), Indian and Chinese. This first volume, if not already
issued, is expected to appear immediately. It will be followed
in rapid succession by the several volumes devoted to the statistics
of mortality, population by age and sex, and such particulars as
relate to the moral and intellectual condition of the people, as
churches, schools, paupers, crime, libraries, &c., while a concluding
volume will relate to health and industry. The complete work was
promised before December. We hope the details of the census
of the United Kingdom may be published with at least equal
promptitude.
A preliminary stage of the important work of numbering and
describing the people, houses, and buildings, of the United
Kingdom was the delivery of schedules to the occupiers of houses,
and on Monday, April 3rd, the culminating duty was performed
of collecting the filled-up schedules. The previous business con-
sisted of the signing of the agreement, by which appointed enu-
merators were bound, under a penalty, to discharge their duties
faithfully; to receive their schedules, their enumeration books,
and their instruction and memorandum books. Houses and
buildings had to be enumerated and partially described. Every

inhabited house was of course so indicated, and the facts stated
as to whether the house was occupied by one family or more than
one, or by lodgers in addition to the responsible occupier.
The particulars concerning houses were filled in by the enu-
merator when the schedules were delivered, including the road,
street, number or name of the house or building ; whether a

or other building as thus :-

The enumerator's book stated how many schedules he left at
every inhabited house visited, and how many he collected.
Houses “to let," and houses building were entered, and so de-
scribed. Churches, chapels, public-houses, and public buildings of
all kinds, were noted, as stated, as also premises occupied as offices,
or for other business purposes uninhabited at night. In addition
to these particulars, the enumerator filled up the headings of every
page of his memorandum book with the town, village, or hamlet,
local board, or Improvement Commissioners' district, and the
ecclesiastical district to which the returns related. He also
entered notes in his memorandum book as to the inhabitants of
the district temporarily absent, and the inhabitants temporarily
present,
,—a rather onerous and difficult duty, not probably very
accurately performed. He had also to take cognizance of persons
who, on the night of the 2nd 3rd of April slept or remained in
barns, sheds, caravans, tents, on doorsteps, under arches, in the
fields or woods, or in the open air. To assist in tabulating this
curious information, - some other assistance was doubtless
needed for collecting it,-a schedule was provided in the enu-
merator's memorandum book, in which the stray waifs of hu-
manity--the houseless and homeless—had to be summarized.
The allowances for census work were published in a Parlia-
mentary paper. The superintendent registrars were allowed
61., and 2s. for every 1,000 persons, properly enumerated, over

a
and above the first 10,000 in each district; the registrars had a
fee of 41., and ls. per 100 for every 100 over 1,200 ; the enume-
rators had a fee of ll. ls. and 28. 6d. per 100 for all above 400
enumerated.
In populous districts, the metropolis for instance, the extras
especially with superintendents and registrars exceeded the fees
and the enumerator's extras also made it better worth expending
his labour and time upon the important work. It was stated
that an increased scale of allowances had been made on this occa-
sion of census-taking, but if the work was done faithfully and
intelligently, the fees were fairly and well earned. Take, for
instance, the case of the enumerators, the rank and file of the
census army. They had to attend first at the registrar's office,
forming, in certain instances, a not very “sweet crowd” of from
50 to 100 persons, who were on the whole not among the most
prepossessing specimens of the human race in character and
appearance. There they were in a small room and a narrow
lobby, to wait their turn for an hour it may be, till they were
called in and accepted. They were next required to attend
and “sign the agreement,” when a similar detention occurred.
The next attendance was to get their instructions, enumeration
book, and householders' schedules-scene repeated. Next to
deliver schedules, and keep a record of every schedule delivered ;
if occupier absent or unable to answer, and no one in the house
capable of supplying the information needed, the enumerator
must call again." Having completed his delivery, the enume-
rator, on April 3rd, collected his schedules ; he found some lost,
others blank, others manifestly wrongly filled up; he had to
supply duplicate forms, fill up the blanks, correct as well as he
could evident errors, and having completed his collection, had to
copy every item in the whole of the schedules into his enume-
rator's book, adding more or less copious notes of his own.
Having done all this, he had next to send in before the 10th of
April, all his books and papers, and his claim for payment, which
for a district numbering say 600 inhabitants, amounted to ll. 6s.
sterling, a rate certainly not in excess of that at which some
other kinds of public work is paid, and considering the nature
of the duty, very much below the average.
The instructions to registrars of births and deaths as to their
duties in taking the census, provided that the command-in-chief
should devolve upon the Registrar-General, assisted by a staff
augmented for the special work. His divisional officers, so to
speak, were the superintendent registrars in charge of registra-
tion districts; their subalterns, in turn, were the registrars of
births and deaths in charge of sub-districts ; the enumerators
constituted the “rank and file” of the force.
The authority and duty of supervision of the several classes
of officers was indicated by their designations. The Registrar-
General's powers reached downwards to the enumerator through
the other two classes, and the enumerator's nomination and work
passed upwards through the same channel.

The country was divided into enumeration districts for the
census of 1861, and was thought desirable to retain as far
as possible, especially in the country and in the more crowded
parts of towns, the division then adopted. For such localties the
plan needed but slight modification, but numerous and important
alterations were necessary in relation to the metropolis, and to
many large cities and towns. In the suburbs of London, north,
west, south, and south-east, residential districts have come into
existence with paved roads, streets in scores and inhabited
houses in hundreds, that were fields and gardens, or waste lands
waiting for the builder, in 1861. It is not too much to say that
the revised plan of division for the metropolis required the
addition of hundreds of new enumeration districts. The metro-
polis needed, allowing an average of 1,000 persons to each
enumerator, an army of above 3,880 men, whose fees, according
to the table of allowances sanctioned by the treasury would amount
to nearly 7,0001., which is, of course, exclusive of the extra allow-
ances to registrars and their superintendents for their special
work.
An important circular was issued by the Registrar-General
urging mayors and other local authorities to carry out the pro-
visions of the Local Government Act, which enjoins that all
streets should be named and all houses numbered under their
respective jurisdictions. The circular had some interesting notes
appended, particularly respecting London streets.
that the metropolis has 30,000 streets, of an average length of a
furlong, or an eighth of a mile. The longest run to about a mile,
and a few to even more. The house numbers reach to 929, but
that is the highest figure. The name of a new street in London
is now restricted to one word, with the addition of “street” or
“road” or other analogous term. The word road is only applied
to leading thoroughfares of considerable length. Lists of streets
and of all changes in street names are published in London, the list
showing also the parish in which each is situate, an example worthy
of imitation by the authorities of all large towns. Experience
has decided in favour of numbering the houses of a street, so
that all the numbers upon one side of the street shall be odd, and
on the other side even. The rule is to make the left hand house
at the end of the street nearest one central point (in London it is
St. Paul's Cathedral), No. 1. Thus, with the back towards the
central point the odd numbers are on the left hand side. In
some English villages all the houses are numbered consecutively ;
and that system is also in use in Vienna, where every house has
its own distinctive number. For the purposes of the census a
system of designating every house distinctly would have been of
great utility. It would be also of permanent value for the regis-
tration of births and deaths, for the direction of letters, for regis-
tering electors, and, in short, for all administrative arrangements.
It is much to be desired that local authorities may act upon
this practical suggestion.

a
geometrical progression, and according to this law the problems
might seem simple : given the population of a certain defined
locality in one year, the population of the same locality at the
end of a decade will be so many. There are, however, numerous
disturbing intluences to drain off the naturally increased popula-
tion in one locality, and to add to the natural increase in another.
Among these disturbing influences, facilities for locomotion,
and especially railway communication, take the foremost place.
There are other causes of remarkable changes the population
of particular localities, but the facilities for moving from place to
place offered by railways, and the advantages enjoyed for the
transport of raw material and manufactured products are the
chief agencies which tended to produce the results, in so far as
they have been set forth, of the census of 1871.
There is one class of disturbing influence affecting the popula-
tion, with which railway communication has little or nothing to
do, namely, commercial treaties and altered tariffs. To the
French commercial treaty the falling off in the population of
certain localities is doubtless attributable. Congleton, Cheshire,
for instance, engaged in the silk manufacture, has a population
of 1,000 fewer now than in 1861; Macclesfield, also, with a popu-
lation of 59,345, has 2,198 fewer than in 1861. Coventry, with
40,109 in 1871, shows a falling off of 1,538 since 186). There
are other districts, in which there are no expansive industries
capable of absorbing the increase of population, and the additions
from time to time are of persons who have to leave the place
of their birth under the pressure of inevitable law. In such
places the population fluctuates slightly from one census taking to
another. Of this class is Rutland, the smallest county in Eng-
land, with a population in Oakham district of 11,140, or 28 more
than in 1861; and Uppingham district, the only other in the
county, with a population of 12,242, or 245 fewer than in 1861.
Railway communication, it cannot be questioned, greatly facili-
tates the efforts of the redundant population of such localities
to find other spheres in which to apply their powers, and opens
to them the labour market of the world.
There are other instances of an opposite character of greatly
increased populations, in which railways play an important
part. In some of these their influence may not be apparent
at first sight, but it is nevertheless vital and essential. The most
marvellous instances of increased population in the United
Kingdom-apart from London--are probably the cases of
Barrow-in-Furness and Middlesborough, North Yorkshire. The
rapid growth of these towns is primarily, it may seem, attributable
to the development of their rich mineral resources, and to the
advantages they enjoy, in conjunction with such resources, in
being seaports. Making every allowance for these facts, how-
ever, without local railways, and railways in other parts, they
never could have reached the prosperity to which they have
attained. If they could do no more than convey their produce
from one seaport to another, and were without the means of

129
internal communication their produce would be comparatively
valueless. The growth of the two towns named is sufficiently
indicated by the increase in their population. In 1831 the popu-
lation of Middlesborough was only 154, in 1861 it had reached
to 18,992, in 1871 it is 46,643. The growth of Barrow-in-
Furness has been little less marvellous. Thirty years ago it was
only a small hamlet; in 1861 it had a population of 3,300 in
1871 it has a population of 18,331.
Barrow and Middlesborough are now incorporated municipal
boroughs. The iron and steel and other works at Barrow employ
above 2,000 men; it has its docks, which are being progressively
extended ; flax and jute mills, rolling mills, iron shipbuilding,
and engine works, waggon works, wire works, and other large
and important undertakings are in active progress, and it has
by the overland and other lines, railway communication with
all parts of the United Kingdom.
The most remarkable evidence of the influence of railways on
population is to be found in London and the other large cities
and towns in the United Kingdom. Facilities for personal inter-
course and for the transport of materials and products, have
attracted large populations to London and other great commercial
and manufacturing centres, whence they are again dispersed
throughout the suburban districts. London, as the real and
living, although not the geographical, centre of the Empire,
first demands consideration. It presents the curious peculiarity
that, whereas in the aggregate its population is enormously
increased, the population of its core, that is of the City proper,
has greatly diminished. The population of London within the
Metropolitan and City Police division in 1851 was 2,680,735 ;
in 1861 it was 3,222,720; and in 1871 it is 3,883,092. In 1861
the sleeping population in the City was 112,063, in 1871 it
was reduced to 74,732, with a day population of probably not
less than 200,000. The inhabited houses in the City now are
9,248, in 1861 they were 13,218. The decrease has been general
in both houses and inhabitants throughout the City. It may
be interesting to state that at the last census, the population
of Marylebone was 477,555, Finsbury 443,316, Tower Hamlets
391,568, Lambeth 379,112, Hackney 362,427, Chelsea 258,011,
Westminster 246,413, Southwark 207,335, Greenwich 167,682,
London City 74,732. The census shows that the borough
and city with the next largest populations are Liverpool 498,346,
and Glasgow with 477,144.
It is not in the city of London alone that the sleeping popula-
tion is diminished. In the Strand registration districts there are
now in round numbers 7,000 fewer night inhabitants than in 1861 ;
in St. Margaret's, St. George's, Hanover Square, 3,000 fewer; in
Marylebone, 3,000; in Camden Town, 5,200 ; in Holywell and
St. Leonard, Shoreditch, 7,000; in Christ Church and St. Saviour's,
Southwark, 6,000 ; in St. Olave, Southwark, 3,500 ; with consider-
able reductions in numerous other districts. * The localities in which

these outlying inhabitants, and the majority of the new comers,
have their domiciles may be inferred from a round of visits to the
railway termini on a succession of mornings from eight to ten o'clock
or of afternoons from to four to six. The omnibuses and tramway
cars inwards may also be noticed as conveying their heavy con-
tingents every morning to make up the day population of London.
In the immediate neighbourhood of London, the largest increase
in population has been in Kensington, Islington, and Kentish
Town. In Kensington, with Brompton, Hammersmith, and
Fulham, there is a population of 283,000, which is an increase of
98,000 upon the population of 1861. The population of Islington,
213,749, is an increase of 58,408 upon the census of 1861.
Kentish Town, with a population of 68,198, shows an increase of
23,881. Hampstead, with a population of 32,271, shows an
increase of 13,165. Bethnal Green shows an increase of about
15,000.
The residential traffic accommodated by the railways is indi-
cated by the greatly increased population of some of the suburban
districts in other directions, and of the towns surrounding
London, and even as far distant from it as Tunbridge, Hastings,
Brighton, and other outlying towns. The population of Bow in
the East is 67,777, or an increase of 32,110 upon the population
in 1861. Brixton has 35,431, or 15,364 inhabitants more than it
had in 1861. Battersea has increased by 34,388, the population by
the last census being 53,988. Peckham has 42,159 inhabitants,
14,024 more than in 1861 ; and the parish of St. George, Camber-
well, shows an increase of 13,518. Notwithstanding the closed
dockyards, the population of St. Paul's, Deptford, amounting to
53,696, is an increase of 15,862 upon the population of 1861.
Those who know the district, however, are aware that that
increase is not in the town of Deptford proper but in the
residential districts, known as New Cross, Brockley, Lewis-
ham High Road, and the parts adjacent. Eltham shows
an increase of 1,519 in its population. Lee, including
parts of Blackheath, with a population of 16,430, shows an
increase of 5,427. Lewisham, with 11,508, of 4,136 more than
in 1861. Sydenham is increased by 8,421 in the ten years. In
Epsom and the two adjoining districts there is an increase of
8,000, in a population of 30,000. Reigate has increased by 6,354
in 20,058 ; and Croydon has risen from 37,093 in 1861 to 71,315
at last census. All round on the south-west, south, and south-
east of London similar illustrations abound; the populations
have largely increased during the ten years at Wimbledon,
Kingston, Richmond, Bromley, Bickley, Bexley, Chislehurst,
Dartford, Tunbridge and Tunbridge Wells, which have together
a population of 38,458, being an increase of 9,673 upon the popu-
lation of 1861. Hastings and St. Leonards have an increase of
more than 12,000, the total population being 20,013.

new streets and thoroughfares.

part, of railway season tickets, may be traced to numerous other
localities, to the north-east, north, north-west, and west of London,
to places where the increase in the population is mueh greater
than the geometrical ratio of Malthus or any of the statists would
bring out. In the east and north-east, West Ham, Stratford,
Leyton, and Walthamstow, have a total population of 99,143,
being an increase of no less than 39,824 since 1861. Further
round to the west, various other metropolitan suburbs that may be
said to have been created by the railways, show an extraordinary
increase in population : Hornsey, Tottenham, Edmonton, and
Enfield united have an increase of 24,486 persons; the new suburb
of Willesden, to the north-west, has risen from a population of 3,879
in 1861, to 15,861 in 1861, a difference of 11,982. Finchley has
an increase of 3,212, Barnet of 2,285, Hendon, 2,457, Harrow,
3,493. And even Watford has received a considerable addition
to its resident population from the day population of London,
the increase being 4,656 upon a population of 7,418 in 1861. In
a westerly direction, regal Windsor has added 3,595 souls to its
population of 13,621 in 1861, but the increase does not, to an appre-
ciable extent, consist of royal personages or their dependents.
Isleworth and Hounslow have an increase of 4,394, Twickenham
of 2,458, Chiswick of 2,003, Brentford, the county town of Mid-
dlesex (?) of 6,303, and Acton of 6,240. Many other illustrations
might be given from the census returns, not only of the magnitude
and growth of London within a fifteen miles' radius around
Charing Cross, but also of the creation and growth of distant
towns, united to London by the railways and bound to it by the
daily intercourse of their populations.
Numerous other cities and towus furnish illustrations of the
beneficial action of the railways in relieving crowded central
Localities of their resident population, and facilitating their daily
removal to more salubrious localities without the city. Liverpool
has a population of 493,346, or an increase of 49,408 as com-
pared with that of 1861. Concurrently with this large in-
crease, there is a decrease of 31,389 in the population of seven
central registration districts, but an increase of no less than
117,005 in seven other surburban districts, which had a popula-
tion of 225,847 in 1861. In like manner, Manchester, with
383,843, has a population of 21,483 less in four central districts
than it had in 1861, but has a more than corresponding increase
in surburban localities, accessible by railways, such as Stretford,
Cheadle, Wilmslow, Bowden, and the like. The last-named
favourite residential locality, with Altrincham, has an increase of
above 7,000 upon a population of 18,214 in 1861. The popula-
tion of Manchester with Salford, the “borough” or Southwark
of Manchester, has now reached an aggregate of 508,648 being
an increase of 48,220 upon the population of 1861.
Amongst the census curiosities it was found that St. Kilda,
in the Hebrides, was left out. It was afterwards ascertained
that the inhabitants on the island only numbered 71, 43 females
and 28 males. There was only one child, and that was in a

dying condition. For a number of years, so it is stated, children
born on the island or brought to it have not survived.
As regards longevity Cumberland is conspicuous. The
registrar of Whitehaven entered in a recent quarter the deaths
of 15 persons whose ages aggregated 1203 years, or an average of
80 years each, the 5 eldest averaged 90 years each.
From the returns it would appear that the children of West-
morland are better cared for in the matter of education than
those of any other English county.
In almost all cases of cities and boroughs there is an increase
more or less in the population ; but there are exceptions in which
there is a decrease, as in the cases of Marlborough in Wiltshire ;
Devonport, Devon; Truro and Falmouth, Cornwall; Wells,
Somerset; Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire ; Ludlow and Bridge-
north, Shropshire; Coventry, Warwickshire ; Stamford, Lincoln-
shire; Stockport, Macclesfield, Congleton, and Staley bridge,
Cheshire; Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire; Knaresborough and
Richmond, Yorkshire. On the other hand there has been a
marvellous increase in the population of various other towns and
localities, to which we have referred elsewhere.
It is somewhat strange that the regulations touching the
census of England, Scotland, and Ireland should vary so much.
We have already described what the requirements were for
England and Wales. For Scotland the inquiry applied amongst
other particulars to the number of the population, the children
receiving education, the houses, and the rooms with windows.
The Irish census embraced the number of inhabitants for each ten
years since 1841; the religious profession in 1861 and 1871; the
number of houses, and the number of families for the last four
census takings.
We now proceed to give a résumé of the results of the census.

acres ; that there are 4,259,032 inhabited houses, and 22,704,108
inhabitants. The rate of increase in the population from 1851
to 1861 was 12 per cent., from 1861 to 1871 it has been 13 per
cent. The population of England and Wales in 1801 was
8,892,536, and the increase since is nearly equal to the whole
population existing in that year, when the country was engaged
in the great conflict with France and other powers.
In the north, Stockton and Newcastle have greatly increased
in population ; Cockermouth, in Cumberland, singularly con-
tains precisely the same population (7,057) in 1871 as in 1861 ;
Whitehaven shews a slight decrease. In Wales many towns
such as Newport, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea, and others
show a large increase in population ; but at Pembroke, Haver-
fcrlwest, and Beaumaris there is a considerable decrease. It
would appear that the population of the United Kingdom is
never stationary, but increases at about the rate of 700 per day.
The census returns show that during the reign of her Majesty
Queen Victoria, her subjects have increased by nearly 6,000,000
persons.
We learn from the census of the United States that the popu-
lation in the aggregate is somewhere about 40,000,000, of whom
about 33,000,000 are natives, and the remainder foreigners.
There are many particulars of much interest in the Registrar-
General's preliminary report, which limitation of space forbids
us to enter upon.
The Scotch census is very interesting. It gives the particulars
common to the English enquiry, and also professes to supply an
account of the houses and rooms with windows. This portion of
the return we consider so vague as to be worthless. The enquiry
regarding education is interesting.
The ages of the children receiving education differ from those
referred to in the census of 1861. Then it was directed that the
number of all children of the age of
five to fifteen years
who attended school should be given ; but the result was unsatis-
factory, and did not accomplish the end in view. In 1867, the
Scottish Education Commissioners reported that “any attempt
at school legislation must fail, unless legislators take into account
the period of life which can be spared for educational pur-
poses.
“From these facts, it appears that in Scotland, education does
not begin much earlier than six years.
“It has already been observed that comparatively few children
remain at school after twelve years of age ; and the question
arises, whether school attendance can be prolonged beyond that
period.
It
may be assumed, therefore, that a large majority of the
scholars attend school for some time between the ages of six and
twelve."
It should here be stated that Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee,
and others of the large towns in Scotland, are much better sup-

plied with infant schools than cities and towns south of the
Tweed.
The population of Scotland, including the seamen belonging
to the shipping in Scottish ports or waters, amounted on April
3rd, 1871, to 3,358,613 persons, of whom 1,601,633 were males,
and 1,756,980' females. This, as compared with the census of
1861, shows an increase of 296,319 persons in ten years, or 9:67
It thus appears that the population of Scotland has been in-
creasing during the past ten years very nearly in the same ratio
that it did from 1831 to 1841, and from 1841 to 1851. It may
be
remembered that, probably from the greater amount of emigra-
tion, and greater slackness in trade, the increase between 1851
and 1861 was only at the low rate of 6 per cent., so that the
diminished emigration and the increased prosperity of the
country between 1861 and 1871 seem sufficiently to explain the
greater rate of increase during these years. The tables relating
to emigration show that between 1861 and 1871 only 257,838
natives of Scotland emigrated from the ports of the United
Kingdom at which there are emigration officers, while from 1851
to 1861, with a smaller population, the number was 183,620.
In Scotland there has been a continuous progressive in-
crease, at a regular rate, from 1801, when the population was
1,608,420, until 1871, when it was 3,358,613. This increase,
however, is unequally divided. The population in 1871 is, in
each instance, less than in 1861, in the cases of Shetland 31,605,
present population, Orkney 31,272, Caithness 39,989, Sutherland
23,686, Ross and Cromarty 80,909, Inverness 87,480, Perth
127,741, Kinross 7,208, Roxburgh 53,965, Dumfries 74,794,
Kirkcudbright and Wigton 38,795, Argyll, reduced in population
from 1831, when it contained 100,973 inhabitants, to 75,635 in
1871. In numerous Scottish counties there are only slight
variations in the number of inhabitants during the last 10 years.
The increase of 300,000 in the population is made up from the
following counties :-Banff about 3,000 increase; Aberdeen about
23,000; Fife, 6,000; Stirling, 7,000; Dumbarton, 6,000; Ren-
frew about 39,000; Ayr, 2,000; Lanark, 134,000; Edinburgh,
55,000; with smaller additions from other counties. The popu-
lation of the principal towns in Scotland in 1861 was 884,955, in
1871 it was 1,068,483; the population of other large towns was
at the former period 254,030, in 1871 it was 310, 144; the popu-
lation of the small towns in 1861 was 502,833, in 1871 it was
540,689; the population of the rural districts in 1861 was
1,420,476, in 1871 it was 1,439,297. The percentage of increase
has been in the principal towns 20.96 per cent., in the large
towns 22:09, in the small towns 7:53, in the rural districts 1:32.
The aggregate increase in the population of Scotland has been
at the rate of 9•67 per cent. in the last ten years.
The Irish enumeration was effected by the officers and men of
the Royal Irish constabulary, whose local knowledge rendered
them peculiarly well suited for the undertaking. The country

was divided into 248 districts, and 4,536 men of the Royal Irish
constabulary, with 178 of the Dublin metropolitan police were
employed as enumerators, under inspectors.
It is melancholy to notice the decrease in the population of
Ireland, notwithstanding its superior natural resources compared
with those of Scotland. We subjoin a painfully interesting state-
ment.
The total population recently enumerated amounts to 5,402,759
-the sexes being 2,634,123 males and 2,768,636 females, or
396,208 of both sexes less than returned for April, 1861–being
a decrease of 6.83 per cent. during the last ten years—7:16 per
cent. as regards males, and 6:52 respecting females.

per cent. ; the city of Waterford, •19 per cent. ; and the county
of the town of Carrickfergus, .22 per cent.

Scotch, 819,665 Irish, 287,153 Foreigners, 108,131 not specified.
Reverting to Ireland, the number of houses inhabited in 1841
was 1,328,839; this number gradually fell to 960,352 in 1871;
there was a similar decrease in the number of houses uninhabited
and building. The decrease in the number of inhabited houses
from 1861 to 1871 was 34,804, or 3.50 per cent. ; the decrease
in the number of uninhabited houses 12,635, or 30-85 per cent;
the decrease in houses building 642 or 21:99 per cent. There
has been a slight increase of houses building in Ulster.
The inquiry into the religious denominations of the inhabit-
ants of Ireland gives the following results for 1871 :- Attached
to the Roman Catholic Church, 4,141,933 ; “ Church of Ireland,"
“ Irish Church, 467,865, and Protestant Episcopalians,
215,430 ; these two amounting together to 683,295, represent
what was denominated the “Established Church.” Presbyterians
number 503,461; Methodists, 41,815; Independents, 4,485; Bap-
tists, 4,643 ; Society of Friends, 3,834 ; Jews, 258. In addition
to these there is a residue of 19,035, classed as of “other Chris-
tian persuasions," including members of the Moravian Church,
travellers, temporary lodgers, and mendicants (presumed to be
Christians), as to whom the enumerators, or the persons who
filled the householders' schedules, were unable to obtain the
necessary information.
The preliminary reports from the census schedules present as
yet only unrevised figures, but it may be supposed that the
results approximate very nearly to absolute accuracy.
An important use has been made of the census returns by the
supply of information desired by School Boards established
under the Elementary Education Act of 1870. The London
School Board alone was supplied from the Census Office with
certain particulars concerning 700,000 children between the ages
of three and thirteen, living within the limits of the London
School Board district. The communication of the information
could not be regarded as strictly in good faith, an official document
having declared that the facts and figures collected under the
authority of the Census Acts would be strictly private, and used
for no other purpose whatsoever than for the numbering of the
people. It may here be remarked that one of the queries in the
census schedule excited considerable suspicion, and in numerous
instances was evaded. It related to the number of men and boys
employed in his business, by the “head of family” making the
return. It was not unnatural that the tradesmen or others so
interrogated should suspect an underground communication
between the Census Office and that of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and that in the event of their returning 20 or 30
men as being in their employment, the astute head of the Exche-
quer Department, or his subordinates, might conclude that such

householder was paying less than he ought in income tax. In
any case, it would have been better, probably, that the in-
formation collected for the education census should not have
been supplied to the School Board by the census authorities,
and that the former body should have adopted its own course in
taking the educational census.
With reference to the latter subject, a great mass of
curious information was obtained ; and it is due to the School
Board to say that, if the educational enumerators did their duty,
the Board obtained the statistics at a very low price. The
remuneration given to the educational census enumerators was
five shillings per 100 families. In the days when mendicancy
was legalised in Scotland a clever Gaberlunzie was accustomed
to say that “ Kelsy weel beggit's worth 15 shillings a day.” No
educational census enumerator could, with a long and toilsome
day's work, make a third of the beggar's amount. The particu-
lars the enumerator had to collect were :-Names of heads of
families, children's names of the school age, the ages of such
children, if educated at a school where the fee exceeds 9d. per
week, if educated at a school where the fee is 9d. per week or
less; to state the name and locality of such school ; if not
attending school to state the reason ; to state also whether
young persons of the school age at work were earning full
wages or were “half-timers.” Having collected all this infor-
mation, sometimes after repeated calls, he was required to tabu-
late it, his abstract sheet containing no fewer than twenty-
one columns, embracing the number of page in his enume-
ration book, number of families visited, the total number of
children belonging to the class who pay above 9d., and a sub-
division of the children attending school and not attending
school respectively, of the class paying 9d. per week or less
for schooling, giving the boys and girls separately under
ich of these two classes in four groups--3 and under 5 (boys
and girls separately), 5 and under 7, 7 and under 10, 10 and
under 13. The last two columns embraced the young people of
the school age, receiving full wages, or who were half-timers.
A penalty was attached to refusal of information to the popu-
lation census enumerators, but not to the educational census
inquiry. In some instances the information for the population
census returns was withheld, but was ultimately obtained
without infliction of the penalty. We know of two instances in
which the schedules were accurately filled up in every particular
except the statement of the ages of the lady-heads of the family,
but even these were obtained by discreet enquiries. A number
of schedules were sent privately to the Registrar-General to
avoid local scrutiny and possible gossip. A gentleman of landed
property refused, on religious grounds, to give the information
required. His scruples were respected, and the information
regarding his family was obtained with tolerable accuracy. One
enumerator was assaulted, and he summoned the householder
before the magistrate, who inflicted a fine. Several householders

in country districts were summoned at the instance of the
enumerators, and fined for resisting the requirements of the
Census Act, but the Registrar-General did not find it necessary
to institute any prosecution, and it may be believed that the
census has never before been more accurately taken.
Relative ages
will vary, doubtless, in different localities, but
the following facts from a metropolitan surburban district may
be interesting. In the schedules of one enumerator, of which
there were 261 delivered, embracing 222 inhabited houses, 17
uninhabited and 8 building, the males enumerated were 475 and
the females 669, total, 1,144. Of these there were 31 infants
under twelve months. The average to each house was about
5 persons. The district contained 59 widows, but only 3
widowers. The average ages of families vary very much. In
one instance the family consisted of a widow and four grown
up daughters, the average age being 30 years ; in another case
the average age of the two heads of the family and their four
children was 31 years ; in two other instances of families of seven
children each, the average ages were 13 and 16. In three other
cases taken in the same locality, the average ages of the families
enumerated were 12:5, 13.5, and 14.5. In a population of
664, taken indifferently, the following, exclusive of the 31 infants
above referred to, were the relative ages :—There were under 5

in 47 instances, the wife is older than the husband, in 102 in-
stances the husband is older than the wife, and in 27 instances
the husband and wife are of the same age.
The professions and occupation of the persons living in the dis-

minister, and a Chef d'orchestre ; an actress and 6 artists; a
superannuated dockyard foreman, and a superannuated dock-
yard foreman's wife;" a consulting ship-builder, and several
policemen ; 20 governesses, and one Bible woman ; 22 annuitants
and 3 journalists and newspaper contributors ; one cambist”
and one sugar planter ; 3 telegraphists, one public-house bar-
man, one colonial broker, one hotel manager, and one sea-going
engineer's wife; a hoop-bender and a captain in the merchant
service; an organ builder and a horse-master ; 96 warehouse-
men, commercial and banking clerks, and accountants ; 19
government clerks, 15 commercial travellers, and a great variety
of other business assistants.
In conclusion, we must wait for the revision and arrangement
in the Census Office of the vast amount of valuable information
that has been collected by the army of 32,000 enumerators,

under the direction of their superior officers. From the revised
census reports we shall learn to quote the words of the Regis-
trar-General and his associates, ®“ How the population of the
kingdom is upheld ; how this marvellous society is organised ;
how the people are distributed; what houses they dwell in;
what numbers of either sex, of children, of men, and women,
are living, married, single, widowed at the several ages ;
what are their relations to heads of families; what occu-
pations men and women of the several ages follow ; what num-
bers living in the several places were born in the same or in other
parishes, counties, and countries; and what numbers of the two
sexes were labouring under infirmities of the chief senses or of
the mind in every locality. This analysis will require time, as
it deals with millions of facts and persons; when completed, all
the data will contribute to the self-knowledge of the nation.
Mere numbers are elements of force, and a prolific, must in the
end, beat a sterilized people ; but this element of quantity is
second in importance to the qualities of the race, for an intel-
ligent, vigorous, and healthy nation, well organised, is alone
worthy of continuous existence.”
NOTES. — DENSITY OF POPULATION AND RATES OF INCREASE.
-The Metropolitan Police District of London embraces 687
square miles, or a square of 254 miles on the side. It has 5,652
persons to the square mile. The population is increasing at the
rate of 4:19 per cent. per annum. Kent, Surrey (except parts in
London), Sussex, Southampton, and Berks, have 341 persons to
the square mile. The annual rate of increase to the population
is 1.60 per cent. Middlesex (except part of London) Hertford,
Bucks, Oxon, Northampton, Hunts, Beds, and Cambridge, 288
persons to the mile ; increase 1:08 per cent. Essex, Suffolk, and
Norfolk, 243 to the mile ; increase 0:64 per cent. Wilts, Dorset,
Devon, Cornwall
, and Somerset, 241 to the mile ; increase 0:24
per cent. Gloucester, Hereford, Salop, Stafford, Worcester, and
Warwick, 432 to the mile; increase 1:06 per cent. Leicester,
Rutland, Lincoln, Notts, and Derby, 254 to the mile ; increase
0:88 per cent. Cheshire and Lancashire, 1,082 to the mile ;
increase 1:43 per cent. Yorkshire, 419 persons to the mile;
increase 1•74 per cent. Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland,
and Westmorland, 259 persons to the mile, increase 2 per cent.
Wales, 178 persons to the mile ; increase 0.93 per cent. The
increase in each case is the annual rate. The aggregate increase
for England and Wales was 12 per cent. from 1851 to 1861 ;
it has been 13 per cent. from 1861 to 1871.

ARCHITECTURE AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
I. GENERAL PROGRESS.-ART AND PUBLIC MONUMENTS.
ARCHITECTS and builders complain that there is less building in
progress than in past years ; but the number of new buildings
we see on every hand, and the accounts we have from all the
large towns of the works constructed or contemplated, instead of
indicating any material falling off, rather suggest that there is
at least enough activity to call forth the best energies of the
artist. Indeed, we are far from certain that some abatement of
the speed with which we have of late been piling brick and stone
may not be beneficial-to the art if not to the artisan. There
has been a great deal to do, and it has had to be done hurriedly.
Sufficient time has in few instances been allowed for the patient
consideration of the idea that seems to be necessary for the suc-
cessful accomplishment of any artistic work. The execution of a
design may be swift, but the gestation will have been slow where
the work is worthy. In the racing speed with which we have
been designing and building, how seldom does the design appear
to have been deliberately thought out with reference first to the
purpose of the building, and then to the fitness and beauty of
its appearance ? In the case of our leading architects, if we
consider the number of commissions they have on hand-new
buildings, extensions and alterations of old ones, church restora-
tions and so forth-hurried work is unavoidable. Where a man
has a multitude of things to do within a limited time, he can
give little continuous and concentrated thought to any one; and
where these things are buildings which involve a large amount
of internal arrangement as well as the necessity of an attractive
and ornamental exterior, much of the work must be delegated to
assistants, and, with the current opinion that the highest achieve-
ment of an architect is the successful imitation of some recog-
nised style or model, the ready course is to take, in whole or
part, an admired type and adapt it to the purpose ; or to put
together a number of parts more or less freely borrowed from
“the best examples” of the style selected. It is a method which
saves time and thought, and the design so produced is sure to
meet the approbation of competent judges.” If it be good
thirteenth century Gothic," whether foreign or native, it will be
sure to find defenders, whatever may be the size, place, or pur-
pose of the building. And those who condemn it because it is

Gothic, would be equally earnest in praise of an Italian or French
Renaissance edifice designed on a similar principle.
Broadly, our current civil architecture may be divided pretty
equally into mediæval and renaissance; our ecclesiastical archi-
tecture, it is needless to say, is wholly mediæval. But neither
among medieval or renaissance architects is there any apparent
approximation to uniformity of practice. Our Gothic, as we
have pointed out in preceding volumes has been steadily becoming
more and more foreign in character, till now it is quite a rare
thing to see even a village church built without some unmistak-
able foreign feature. But even in this quasi-continental Gothic,
the only agreement seems to be to recede farther and farther
from the present time; for a model, French, Italian, and even
German is being taken almost indifferently. Structurally, the
chief thing our Gothic architects seem to desire is irregularity
of outline, an unequal distribution of the leading masses, a
scattered play of light and shade. In renaissance we have every
variety from the most “classic” Italian, to the most piquant
French or Flemish. The only thing we do not see is originality,
and probably a really original building would be condemned on
all sides. Yet we must have original work before we can lay
claim to an architecture that shall be more than ephemeral.
As we have often said, all true architecture has been the
growth of its own age and country, not a reproduction of any
other. Even the much abused Renaissance was genuine, inas-
much as it was the actual product of the mind of the time: based
on early styles, but not a copy of any. With us, style, whether
mediæval or classic, is commonly a mere excrescence or incon-
gruity as applied to a building erected for the special objects and
requirements of English life in the last half of the nineteenth
century, however appropriate it may have been to the habits and
sentiments of the ecclesiastics, and possibly of the people of the
thirteenth or fourteenth century, or to the current ideas of Italian
artists, and cognoscenti in the fifteenth or sixteenth century ; in
either case it is an anachronism now, whether regarded in its
structural features or ornamental details.
Some such feeling seems to be slowly forming with reference
to the projected Courts of Justice. Mr. Street has remodelled his
design, and, whilst it is positively asserted that the new design
has not been approved by the authorities, the foundations are
being laid ; yet the leading organ of public opinion has been un-
equivocal in its condemnation of the design, and is urging with all
its might that it is even now “the duty of the Government to
reserve the question [of its erection) for consideration by Parlia-
ment.” It adds, “the construction of the foundations on the
selected site may very well go on in the meantime, so that the
delay, after all, need not materially retard the ultimate comple-
tion of the work." This last sentence is a fair illustration of the
hazy notions commonly held respecting architectural design. In
one line we are told that the "amended design is entirely unsa-
tisfactory, as unworthy of acceptance as the original scheme," and

nesses.
is to be cast aside without hesitation and an absolutely new
design obtained, and then that while the new design is being
prepared, the construction of the foundations may be proceeded
with, as though the foundations were no part of the design,
instead of being its very pith and essence, that on which its
character should mainly depend, and which should mould and
colour every part of it.
Our opinion of Mr. Street's former design was expressed very
plainly. We have little more hope of the amended design. The
original design would have made the Courts of Justice resemble a
huge monastery; the amended design, with its endless gables,
pyramidal roofs, towers, turrets, spires, pinnacles, rose and lancet
windows, brackets, parapets, canopied statues, and the like, will
have the aspect of an overgrown and over-decorated college. In
the amended design, the Strand front is 500 feet long, space
enough for one of the noblest façades of the century. If not
further amended, it promises to be a congeries of small pretti-
In order to avoid monotony, Mr. Street has sacrificed
symmetry; or it may be that what seems excessive irregularity
of arrangement has been devised with a view to achieve pic-
turesqueness. A grave mistake. It is easy to produce irre-
gularity, but the picturesque is never made. It is the result of
time and accident; of growth and decay. To set aside the design,
or, rather let us say, the architect, now, is however not a thing to
be thought of. Mr. Street, with all his peculiarities, is a true
artist, as well as a skilful architect. The Government may well
say to him : “Your design is very generally disapproved. Con-
sider carefully the objections that have been made to it. Take a
reasonable time to study again the whole problem. See whether
both plan and elevation cannot be remodelled ; bearing in mind
that the requisites are—the utmost attainable convenience in the
one, simplicity, unity, dignity, in the other.” If Mr. Street would
do this, it not yet too late for him to design a building in his
favourite Gothic, that shall be appropriate, dignified, noble ;
worthy of his own reputation, of the purpose, and of the country.
It would doubtless cause some mortification again to reconsider
his design ; but he has good precedents. Wren saw his favourite
design for St. Paul's ruthlessly superseded, and at once com-
menced another on the plan imposed
upon him ; or if that be too
distant, he may remember that the late Sir James Pennethorne
had to make a third design for the London University, and on
the last occasion succeeded in satisfying almost everybody. Far
better for the architect to do thus than have his name associated
for ever with an unsatisfactory building. And this is a building
that will be one of the largest and most important in London,
and occupy one of the most conspicuous sites. If any labour can
render it worthy it should be bestowed upon it.
Of the other national buildings it will be enough to make a
very brief report. The new Home and Colonial Offices advance
but slowly: we shall have long to wait before we can judge of their
effect. The new General Post Office is proceeding far more

rapidly. Already its general character is fairly developed. What
was proposed we stated last year, and the building, as far as it
has proceeded, agrees very well with the description. The prin-
cipal front in St. Martin-le-Grand will be nearly as long as the
General Post Office, opposite which it is being built. It will be
four storeys high, of Portland stone on a granite basement, the
pilasters of the first two storeys Tuscan, of the upper storeys
Roman Corinthian. The chief entrance is by a central portico,
not very imposing from its proportions or design. On the whole
we see little cause thus far to modify the opinion expressed in
anticipation. In laying the foundation stone, the Commissioner
of Works announced that “in the design and construction of the
building he had not allowed ideas of fancy or of taste to be made
paramount to the demands of public utility.” The sins of fancy
or of taste are as little likely to be charged against the New
General Post Office as against the Commissioner; all we can hope
is, that the demands of public utility will be satisfied by the in-
ternal arrangements.
Little more has been done to the Record Office, but the Com-
missioners have given notice of their intention to take the land
and houses necessary for constructing the Chancery Lane portion
of the building, which will thus for the first time be brought pro-
perly into public view. A like notice has been given as to the
land required for a new Mint, on the erection of which the well-
known building on Tower Hill will be sold or pulled
down. The
new Mint will occupy a site between the Thames Embankment
and Whitefriars, bounded east and west by the premises of the
City Gas Company and of Messrs. Powell the well-known glass
manufacturers. For the extension of the National Gallery a large
space has been cleared in the rear of the present building. That
some such extension was imperatively required was evident when
it was found necessary to remove the pictures from one of the
principal rooms to admit the newly purchased Peel collection ;
but long before that purchase increased the need for further
space, a large proportion of the British and some foreign pictures
were either not hung or relegated to South Kensington, in con-
sequence of there being no room for their exhibition at Charing
Cross. How far the projected extension is part of a comprehen-
sive scheme, whether Mr. Barry's designs will be followed, or
what is to be the character of the additional building we are
ignorant. The spacious Italian structure erecting from the designs
of Messrs. Banks and Barry, on the Piccadilly side of Burlington
House, for the use of the scientific societies, though it has made
considerable progress, is not sufficiently advanced, and too much
encumbered with scaffolding, to allow of fair judgment. The con-
struction of the new Museum of Natural History, which is to
occupy a portion of the site of the International Exhibition of
1862, has not been commenced.
Nearly opposite to it, however, a building which presents some
novelty of appearance has challenged, and doubtless secured, the
attention of visitors to the International Exhibition of 1871. It

a
is to serve for the Science Schools, and forms a part of the South
Kensington Museum, as originally designed by the late Captain
Fowke. The new building, which we suppose will eventually
form one of the advanced wings of the Museum, is a block of
considerable magnitude, having a frontage of 186 feet by 96
feet high. It is constructed of red brick and terra-cotta, and
appears to be a model of good workmanship. The novelty in the
construction is the extent to which terra-cotta has been employed;
the chief novelty in the design is the carrying out, on terra-cotta
brackets, or cantilevers, of an ornamental arcade, as the highest
or attic storey. The building is four storeys high, with slightly
advanced wings. The ground floor in the central portion has a
deeply-recessed arcade, corresponding to that in the upper storey,
but whilst the lower arcade has only seven arches, the upper has
twenty-one. The effect of both is decidedly good. The lower
arcade gives mass and dignity, the upper lightness, and both
afford strong play of light and shade. The terra-cotta shafts,
arches, brackets, cornices, medallions, and ornamental details
generally, conduce to the general richness, and harmonize suf-
ficiently in colour with the deep red brick. Moulded work is,
of course, less effective than the work of the chisel, and these
terra-cotta blocks do not appear to have been always fired suc-
cessfully. But whatever drawbacks be admitted, it cannot be
doubted that terra-cotta promises to be a valuable addition to the
architect's treasury of decorative materials; and if it should be
found not to blacken or discolour seriously under the influence of
a metropolitan atmosphere, it may greatly assist in modifying
and enriching our ordinary street architecture. The building
before us was erected under the superintendence of Major-General
Scott, to whom the credit of its present aspect and character
must be assigned: the general plan is that of Captain Fowke.
Only the exterior of the building is finished.
Major-Gen. Scott holds nearly the same position with reference
to the neighbouring International Exhibition Building and Royal
Albert Hall that he does to the Science Schools. The general plan
was Captain Fowke's, but he lived to do little more than prepare
the broad scheme; the execution of it, the modification as
well as the embodiment of it, the structural and ornamental
details, and the actual erection were the task imposed upon
Major-General Scott. The plan of the International Exhibition
permitted of no external architectural character, and entailed the
long, scrambling, wearisome arrangement of rooms. Mure might
doubtless have been done for internal effect, but it was deter-
mined, not unwisely, to concentrate the interest as far as practicable
on the objects exhibited. Another year something might be
done to display those objects better, and, either by improved
arrangement or something less imbecile than this year's cata-
logues, render the search for particular specimens less hopeless.
It would be idle to dwell on a structure which everybody has
seen and made up his mind about. Enough that we give a
passing word of commendation to the general appearance and

quiet good taste of the rooms, and to the lighting of the
picture galleries. But these galleries are too narrow to admit
of pictures on the walls and sculpture and nick-nackeries
in the centre. So filled the rooms may have a pretty general
effect when only a few visitors are present; but on ordinary
days during the past exhibition passage was uncomfortable,
pictures of any size could only be seen with difficulty, and then
imperfectly, and the sculpture could scarcely be seen at all.
Another year the picture galleries should be confined strictly to
pictures, with merely settees in the centre for the convenience of
visitors ; and if sculpture be exhibited it should be in rooms
appropriated to the purpose, where the several specimens should
have ample room for their full and individual display without
distraction from incongruous surroundings. So only can good
sculpture be studied, understood, and appreciated.
The Royal Albert Hall has steadily won its way in public
favour. its unusual form, size, and character, and certain
sharp criticisms, combined with some shortcomings almost in-
evitable in the haste with which it was hurried to a conclusion
for the opening of the exhibition, rendered the majority of
visitors timid in trusting to their own impressions. Undoubtedly
there were at first palpable acoustic faults, and the grand object
of the building was to provide a vast auditorium ; but these
faults have been remedied, or if any remain there is every
reason to expect that they may be got rid of. Up to the close of
the exhibition there can be little doubt that in this respect there
was continuous improvement. By the courtesy of Major-General
Scott we were enabled to test the acoustic properties of the hall
from every part we chose,' and the result seemed in each instance
satisfactory, with the exception, perhaps, of the gallery, and even
there persons more happily organised pronounced the effect
good. But the conclusion to be drawn is, we apprehend, as
might be anticipated from the vast size and form of the hall,
that it is for grand gatherings and great orchestral and choral
effects that the hall is mainly fitted. Concerted music of a
high character, whether vocal or instrumental, bears out, so to
speak, magnificently, and best of all where both are combined.
Solos require the exceptional organ of a Titiens or Alboni, a
Reeves or Santley to fill satisfactorily the immense area ; a voice
of ordinary power, however pleasing in a concert room, is lost
here, and where the enunciation is imperfect or the music is
common-place, is almost painful.
The appearance of the interior when well filled
and that is
the proper time to form a just opinion of it—is certainly very
fine. The form is eminently pleasing, the proportions are good,
and the ensemble impressive. The very abstinence from ornament
adds to the grandeur. Something more in the way of colour,
with gilding judiciously, not lavishly, used, would help to impart
the brighter and richer tone which such a hall seems to require ;
but we dare say this is among the matters left for more leisurely
consideration and completion.
H

146 Architecture and Public Improvements.
It is a necessary consequence of the form that the exterior
should be less effective than the interior. If it could be properly
seen, however, the mass would convey the impression of grandeur.
And there can be no doubt that it was right, architecturally and
artistically, not to endeavour to evade or conceal the form, but
rather to give to it all due emphasis. On the whole, there is not
much to complain of in the treatment of the exterior. One
might desire more breadth and largeness of handling, however
difficult to secure. The terra-cotta decoration is too small and
pretty for the size of the building, and the frieze still more
inadequate. But the decoration was evidently experimental, and
savours of South Kensington experiments. The good effect of
the porches, especially when they are seen far enough off for the
ornamentation to lose its obtrusiveness, shows how much may be
gained by massiveness and simplicity of handling.
Before quitting the Albert Hall we must express a hope that
before next year a thorough change may be made in the
approach from the Exhibition building: The convergence of the
visitors from the two lines of galleries upon the single small
and inconvenient conservatory entrance, produced scenes that
were at best unseemly and undesirable, and might be dan-
gerous. Something, too, might be done to render the access to
the several parts less puzzling to a stranger, and the egress
easier.
The Albert Memorial, on the opposite side of the road, is
advancing, though little progress is visible. With every passing
month, however, the regret becomes stronger that it was neces-
sary to uncover the upper portion so long before the lower part
was finished, since the feeling is necessarily deepened of its
resemblance to a magnified metal and jewelled reliquary rather
than a majestic stone structure.
Although no apparent progress has been made with the Wel-
lington Memorial, it is some comfort to know that a way has
been found out of the legal and other difficulties between the
Commissioner of Works and the sculptor, and that Mr. Stephens
will himself carry forward the work,-we may hope to an early
and amicable, even if it be not an altogether satisfactory, conclusion.
It is proposed to erect some dozen or more statues of states-
men in the open enclosure once known as Old but now called
New Palace Yard, and a cast of one of Cromwell was set up
by way of experiment. Whether, after refusing him a place
within the palace, the Great Protector will be permitted to stand
outside the doors we are not told ; but it is a good statue,
and ought to find a place somewhere. Marble busts of Lord
Brougham and the Earl of Derby have been set up by the citizens
of London in the Council Chamber of the Guildhall.
A bronze statue of General Sir James Outram by Mr. Noble
has been erected in the ornamental grounds of the Thames
Embankment, and warmly praised by the journals; but it is
raised too high to permit the features to be scanned, and the
rest of the figure will hardly arouse enthusiasm. But statesmen

and warriors are not the only men now honoured with statues.
The range of bronze and marble memorials is manifestly widen-
ing. A bronze statue of Brunel has found a temporary position
not far from the statue of Outram, and another of Stephenson
has been erected by the North Western Railway Company in
front of their Euston Square terminus.

The Thames Embankment is still an incomplete work. The
main portion, from Blackfriars Bridge to Westminster, was
opened more than a year ago, but has even now an unfinished
look; whilst the roadway, from Blackfriars to Cannon-street,
remains only partially opened. Some few additional feet have,
however, been added to it since we last wrote, and the remainder
is promised by Lord Mayor's day. When that day arrives there
will be a broad way from the Mansion House to the Houses of
Parliament, and the full value of this noble work will be appre-
ciated. Side ways from Whitehall and the Strand have been
opened on to the Embankment, and have added much to its
usefulness both for pedestrians and carriages ; but the bit of un-
finished road on the east spoils it for the present as a thorough-
fare. After a hard struggle portions of the reclaimed land, east
and west of the Charing Cross bridge, have been appropriated as
public gardens, and already afford a pleasing relief to the eye of
passenger, and are evidently enjoyed by those for whose use
they were designed. But a screen of stately buildings is wanted
to shut out the unsightly backs of the mean houses which for a
large part of the way disfigure the view. It would be a grievous
pity were this magnificent road to be lined with common-place
terraces ; mischief enough has already been done to it by the
wretched stations of the Metropolitan District Railway. The ex-
periment of planting trees along the sides of the road seems likely
to be successful.
A commencement has been made with a new embankment,
which will extend from Chelsea Hospital to Battersea Bridge. It
is being executed under the direction of the Metropolitan Board
of Works, from the designs of Mr. Bazalgette, their engineer, and
will be similar in character to the portions already completed,
but less costly in construction, and less elaborate in finish. When
completed there will be an almost continuous embankment along
the northern shore of the Thames from Blackfriars to Battersea,
a length of over four miles, with a broad public road the whole
way, with the exception of about a quarter of a mile by the
Houses of Parliament. The Chelsea Embankment will reclaim
9} acres from the Thames, which will be occupied by a roadway
7ő feet wide, and by ornamental grounds. It is expected to be
completed by the end 1873.
The main drainage of the Metropolis still awaits the junction
of the low-level sewer; but the work already accomplished is
amazing. Colonel Hogg, the chairman of the Metropolitan
H 2

Board, stated the other day, that “ during the last 15 years 400
miles of sewers had been made in the metropolis, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Bazalgette, at a cost of six millions. That was in
addition to 700 miles of connecting sewers which had been laid
by the local boards and vestries.” Eleven hundred miles of drains
are sufficiently surprising, but it is only when we recollect the
largeness of scale, the engineering difficulties which had to be
surmounted, and the solid manner in which the great sewers have
been constructed, that we can fairly comprehend the magnitude of
the work that has been accomplished. Two things only are now
wanting in this connection to satisfy the sanitary requirements of
the metropolis. One is, that the sewage carried from London by
this gigantic system of drains shall not continue to be emptied
into the Thames to pollute and poison the stream, but be turned
to profitable use on the land; the other, that the water-supply
shall be rendered pure and adequate to the requirements of the
population. An Act was passed last session, which will tend to
improve the supply, but the time has come when the question of
the water-supply of London, both as to quality and quantity,
should be honestly grappled with, and a really comprehensive
scheme carried out.
The improvements which the city authorities are making in
connection with the Holborn Viaduct have proceeded steadily
during the past year, and the system of streets on either side is de-
veloping to advantage. Especially useful promises to be the broad
street from the Fleet Street end of Farringdon Street to the west
end of St. Andrew's Church, Holborn. At each end of this
street will be a “ Circus,” supplying the centre into which several
lines of traffic will pour. The form is effective in reality as
well as in the ground plan, but whether it is the safest or most
judicious with so vast a traffic of foot passengers and carriages
as will there be brought together may be questioned. Certainly
the most careful police supervision will be required to ensure
safety of life and limb. Holborn Circus is to be adorned with
an equestrian statue of the Prince Consort, for a pedestal to
which the Corporation has just voted a sum of £2,000. The
Fleet Street Circus will probably be thought to be sufficiently
adorned by the railway bridge which there spans Ludgate Hill.
For the new street the west side of Farringdon Market had to be
removed, and the city engineer took advantage of the opportunity
to alter the level, and in a measure remodel the market; and now
a proposition has been made by some of the wholesale dealers and
warmly supported by the City, to remove the vegetable and fruit
market from Covent Garden to Farringdon Market, which is to
be enlarged and thoroughly adapted to the purpose. For Covent
Garden to migrate to Farringdon seems almost too revolutionary
even for this age of changes; if it should take place it would not
be among the least remarkable of the many curious transforma-
tions that have occurred of late in noted London localities. Another
important project in connection with the Holborn Improvements

grounds of the London, Chatham and Dover Company bordering
the viaduct, which is to serve as a connecting station for all,
or nearly all the great lines both north and south of the Thames.
Some such station has long been wanted, and the situation is
perhaps as convenient as any that could be found.
Other metropolitan improvements in opening new streets and
widening old ones, and generally in the way of facilitating traffic,
have been carried out, and several are in contemplation. One
of the most useful will be the formation of a broad thoroughfare
from Charing Cross to the Tottenham Court Road, which will
afford a much needed direct communication from north to south,
but several additional wide streets between Holborn and the
Strand are also required. The introduction of asphalte pave-
ment is a minor, but valuable improvement, and one that
seems likely to spread rapidly. The use of tramways has ex-
tended considerably, perhaps as much as is desirable at present;
if they are to become general they should be laid down on a well-
considered system, and be under municipal or other central
control.
Of railways it will be enough to note the progress. According
to the latest returns there were in October 1871 in operation in
the United Kingdom, 13,971 miles of railway, being an increase
of 243 miles since the corresponding week of 1870. But this
does not include all the lines in operation. In the fuller and
corrected returns to the end of 1870, there were in operation 14,610
miles, and 250 miles have been since completed. Taking the
returns of the past 20 years as our guide, we may venture to say
broadly that we have now nearly 15,000 miles of railway in
operation, and that they are increasing at a rate averaging about
250 miles a year. The capital expended on these lines to the end
of 1870 was 504,381,000l. The traffic receipts for the year
amounted to nearly forty-four millions. Many of the recent addi-
tions have been of branches, or lines made improve or shorten
existing lines to important centres. The number of independent
new lines has not been great, but some considerable works are in
progress.
At last the importance of preserving what is left of the forests,
heaths, and open spaces around London has been practically
recognised. In the Companion to the Almanack for 1866 an
account was given of the then state of Epping Forest with a
sketch of the progress of enclosures ; and the imminent danger
of continued encroachments, notwithstanding a resolution of
the House prohibiting the further sale of Crown rights, and a
later recommendation of a Committee that measures should be
adopted to vindicate the Crown's forestal rights and to abate
enclosures, was distinctly pointed out. Unhappily the rights
were not vindicated, and the encroachment went on.
The sense
of wrong at length grew too strong to be resisted, and now
what is left of Epping Forest is put under sufficient control, and
will doubtless be saved ; its history, however, will remain one
of the darkest blots in our departmental administration. Hamp-

stead Heath is also secured ; and the commons of Wimbledon,
Wandsworth, and Putney have been formally appropriated to
the public on payment of a specified rent to the lord of the
The cost of securing and maintaining these “ open
spaces” may be heavy, but cost in a matter like this is a subor-
dinate consideration. London has become a province of houses
with the population of a small kingdom-a Scotland in a ring-
fence—and a large provision of open country, fresh air, and free
recreation grounds immediately outside the great city, as well as
in its midst, is absolutely necessary if the millions of its inhabi-
tants are to be kept in health and vigour.
And what is essential for London is proportionately so for every
other large town, a fact which is happily being generally recognised.
We have not every year to record the completion of important
people’s parks, like Stanley Park, Liverpool, and Alexandra Park,
Manchester, noticed last year, but we are not without valuable
signs of progress. Thus at Congleton a park of twenty-one acres,
including eight acres of woodland, a terrace a quarter of a mile
long, a bowling-green and cricket-ground, is approaching com-
pletion; it is pleasantly situated by the river, which will afford
facilities for boating. A park is also likely to be provided for
Staleybridge and Ashton-under-Lyne, of which the Highfield
estate will form the nucleus, the Earl of Stamford, to whom it
belongs, having offered it on easy terms for the purpose. Sir
Titus Salt has rounded off his public and private works at
Saltaire by the formation and dedication to public use of a pretty
little park of fourteen acres, and it is worth adding that, in
recognition and acknowledgment of all that he has done for them,
the inhabitants of Saltaire had a full length portrait of the donor
painted by Mr. J. P. Knight, R.A., and presented it to him at a
meeting called for the purpose. Finally, the corporation of
Leeds have just purchased the Roundhay estate of 1,400 acres,
of which the mansion, park and lake, comprising 600 acres, are
to be appropriated as a public park. Roundhay is two miles
from Leeds, but a contiguous property has also been bought,
which will bring the entrance half a mile nearer the town. The
two estates cost 139,0001., a handsome sum for a corporation to
set apart for such an object.
The trustees of the Peabody Fund have completed another of
their series of industrial dwellings, Peabody Square, on the site
of the old Magdalen Hospital, Blackfriars Road. It consists of
sixteen blocks, having a general resemblance to the earlier
buildings, but with a more cheerful aspect, and with improve-
ments suggested by experience. It provides 320 dwellings at
rents ranging from 2s. 6d. to 5s. a-week. Other establishments
are building under the direction of the same architect, Mr. H.
A. Darbishire. The Improved Industrial Dwellings Company
have built some, and are building more of their establishments
at different parts of London ; their total expenditure has now
nearly reached 200,0001., which produces a rental of about
8,500l. per annum, and enables them to pay a dividend of 5 per

eent. to their shareholders. Several other societies are doing
good work in this way, but these will suffice as examples.
The Baroness Burdett Coutts has erected another large and
costly drinking fountain for the use of the London public. It
stands opposite the principal entrance to the Zoological Gardens,
Regent's Park; is of granite, marble, and bronze, with statuary
and carving, and is surmounted with a cluster of lamps, while
from the basins numerous jets of water spring upwards. The
architect was Mr. Darbishire, who has succeeded in producing
a bright and novel design. Another, of a more architectural
character, designed by Mr. F. Butler, is in course of completion
opposite the entrance to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield.
The Marquis of Bristol has erected a handsome fountain by
the Corn Exchange, Bury St. Edmunds ; the Baroness Weld
has presented one of marble to the town of Newbury, Berks ;
the Mayor of Canterbury, one to that city, and others of an
ornamental character have been erected at Frome, Bedford,
Stansted Mountfichet, and elsewhere.
3. CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.
The general remarks with which we commenced this paper
apply to the ecclesiastical as much as to the secular architecture
of the day, it being borne in mind that our new churches are,
as they have been for years past, exclusively Gothic. As to
the kind of Gothic at the moment in favour, we can only repeat
what was said last year, and in the passage just referred to. It
is Gothic of diverse descriptions, though that of the thirteenth
century is the favourite model, and it is usually more or less
foreign in character. Brick is an increasingly favourite material,
and where it is not used for the exterior the inner walls are fre-
quently lined with it. Irregularity of outline is more than ever
in fashion, churches now being nothing if not picturesque. In
the interiors carving and colour prevail very generally, the
strength of pigments, costliness of materials, and elaboration of
ornament culminating properly enough in the chancel or sanc-
tuary, and on the altar and its accessories. The effect is not
always harmonious, and not often artistic, but the work, we are
assured, is to be judged not by the rules of art, but of symbolism.
“We architects," writes an earnest mediævalist,* who was put
forth at the Architectural Conference to expound certain points
of architectural and especially of altar symbolism, “we architects
should infuse a symbolic spirit into the minutest details of all
sanctuary work, even in the dimensions of the altar itself. I
recommend my brother architects in no case to carry out an altar
less than 7 ft. 5 in. long, (both symbolical numerals), and when
possible to exceed this length tỏ let the mystic number 5, so
closely associated with altar ritual, determine in the inches the
exact length of the slab.” This “symbolic treatment” is to rule
throughout, and thus afford to the church “that peculiar aid

which the architect alone, of all laymen, can lend her ;" a fact
which should temper our judgment of ecclesiastical architecture
and art-work generally. Where something occurs harsh or
grating to the secular sense, who can tell but it may be a sym-
bolical numeral, colour, or form, and so be a thing to be honoured
rather than condemned ?
Instead then of coldly criticising, we will accept our ecclesiastical
art-work as we find it, and proceed to tell what has been lately
done in that line. In and about London several new churches
have been built. Eccentricities of design are displayed in some
of them, but for the most part they maintain the level of quiet
respectability. One of the most successful attempts to combine
ritualistic proprieties with convenient arrangements for a large
congregation to both see and hear the preacher, in a church of in-
expensive character, is St. Jude's, Earl's Court, Kensington,
designed by Messrs. G. and H. Godwin. The church, which
affords accommodation for a congregation of 1,600, is early
Second Pointed in style, is faced externally with Kentish rag,
while the interior is lined with coloured brick; consists of nave,
transepts, and chancel, and has an open roof of very high pitch.
Its convenience as an auditorium to which we referred, arises from
the congregation being brought into contiguity with the pulpit
by means of broad double transepts, and the nave arcades being
carried upon light iron columns, which offer little obstruction to
the sight. St. Matthew, Hammersmith, a brick church in Mr.
Blomfield's familiar variety of First Pointed, is also well arranged
for congregational purposes, if it has not beauty of form. St.
Michael and All Angels, Notting Hill, is noteworthy as a
church which is not Pointed Gothic, but Romanesque in style.
The building is of brick, the ornament of terra-cotta, and the
architects, Messrs. Edmeston, have perhaps made as much as
possible of the materials at their disposal. But at present the
church has an unfinished, and necessarily somewhat cheerless
aspect.
Turning from the extreme west to the extreme east of London,
we find in St. Matthew's, Commercial-road, Stepney, a large brick
church, built for a congregation of 1,000 persons, and rather to be
commended for usefulness than elegance. The only part of the
exterior seen, however, is the gable end facing the road, which has
on one side of it a plain square tower with a roof-spire. The style
is late French First Pointed, with plate tracery; architects Messrs.
Newman and Billing Christ Church, Victoria Park, South Hack-
ney, is another plain brick church, built to accommodate a congre-
gation of 700, chiefly of the labouring class.
On the south, St. Stephen's, Walworth Common, is a more
ambitious structure. Like those just noticed it is of brick, but
has terra-cotta ornament, as well as Bath stone in capitals and
dressings. The style is First Pointed, but of Italian type. The
church has nave with aisles, chancel with trilateral sanctuary,
and an external arcade with stairs and gallery. The clerestory
is borne on four Portland stone columns, and carries a close-
a

boarded roof of high pitch. The seats, 750 in number, are all
free; the cost was over 7,000l.; architects Messrs. Jarvis. The
representative church of North London is even more pretentious.
St. Stephen's, South Hampstead, is in what may be called the
Early French Pointed, but it exhibits in the fullest manner, Mr.
Teulon's well-known peculiarities—the tower even surpassing in
ugliness the worst native French example. It is of dark brick with
rough stone bands; is cruciforma in plan, with, at the intersection,
a large square tower the lower part of which serves as chancel,
and a shallow polygonal apse as sanctuary. The windows of the
clerestory, transepts, and apse are pointed, of the aisles square-
headed, in the west end a large rose : all have plate tracery. On
the porches and elsewhere are well carved statues of angels, &c.
The church stands on sloping ground, and the exterior is stu-
diously irregular in outline and un-English in character, and
appears strangely out of keeping amidst the noble old elms which
surround it. The interior is light, rather striking in effect, and
is intended to be highly decorated.
A church with some specialty of purpose has been consecrated
in St. John's Road. St. Peter's, Clerkenwell, or as it is otherwise
called, the Smithfield Martyrs' Memorial Church, was built by
subscription as a memorial of the Reformers who suffered for
their faith in Smithfield, and on the nearest obtainable site to
the scene of their martyrdom. The purpose one cannot but
respect, and the church is carefully and well constructed : yet it
would be difficult to find a more striking illustration of the
absurdity of our present ecclesiastical style, or want of style.
Nothing would appear more obvious than that such a church
should be simple, grave, and unpretending in aspect, and un-
mistakably English and Protestant in character. This, on the
contrary, is complex in plan, irregular in outline, overlaid with
feeble, unnecessary ornament, French Gothic in style, and ultra-
Catholic in feeling. It is built of stock brick, with bands of
coloured brick, and shafts and dressings of Mansfield and
Ancaster stone. In plan it is cruciform, but one transept serves
as an organ chamber, the other for a vestry. The nave runs into
an apsidal chancel ; the aisles into apsidal chapels—the purpose
of which, in a Protestant memorial church, is a mystery-or
perhaps a piece of profound symbolism. Externally the several
parts are of different heights, and the diversity is increased by a
tower on the north-west, which bulges out into a projecting
upper storey, with a fantastic array of pinnacles and purposeless
buttresses, the whole being crowned by a pyramidal roof. The
memorial purpose is marked externally by statues of the prin-
cipal martyrs on the front of the church and in niches of the
tower buttresses, and by rilievi of their martyrdoms on the gables.
Inside, inscriptions, giving the names, dates of death, and declared
crime, are painted along the side walls on imitation hangings; if
the manner be allowed, the inscriptions are appropriate and not
too obtrusive. For congregational purposes, the interior is quite
equal to the average of recent town churches. Symbolically and

a
ecclesiologically the building may be perfect, but for any special
adaptation to its purpose as a Martyrs' Memorial Church it
appears to be the strangest conception that ever entered into the
heart of man.
Several of the new country churches would repay particulari-
sation, but our notice of them must be brief. Some of the
most remarkable are those which have been erected by individual
liberality. Highclere, Hants, designed by Mr. G. G. Scott, R.A.,
and built by the Earl of Carnarvon, in place of the often-mended
old church, is one of the architect's familiar First Pointed
French Gothic edifices. A comparatively small cruciform church,
every part is admirably wrought; the ornament is sufficient
without being excessive, and the whole has an air of lordly
dignity and quiet good taste. Mr. G. E. Street, R.A., has com-
pleted three small country churches for Sir Tatton Sykes-one at
Thixendale, a good plain First Pointed building for 150 people ;
the others of a similar order, at Fimber and Helperthorpe, all in
the East Riding of Yorkshire ; whilst the munificent donor has
laid the foundation stone of another church at Weaverthorpe.
One of the most magnificent of these presentation churches is
that erected on the site of the old parish church of Bolton, Lan-
cashire, by Mr. Peter Ormerod, at a cost of upwards of 50,0001.
The building is of considerable size (nave, 114 feet long and,
with aisles, 67 feet wide, chancel 42 feet by 28), Second Pointed
in style, with elaborate tracery in the windows,
good deal of
careful carving, and richly decorated throughout. The east
window of seven lights is 35 feet high, and filled with painted
glass by Hardman ; the west window of six lights is also large ;
the tower on the north is 142 feet to the top of the parapets.
By those who have seen it, the church is described as a very
noble one.
The architect was Mr. E. G. Paley, of Lancaster.
Worthy to be ranked with this, is the new church of St. John the
Evangelist, Hightown, Cheetham, erected with parsonage) by
Mr. Lewis Loyd, at a cost of over 20,0001. The church is First
Pointed in style, of stone, lined with brick, and will accommodate
540 persons. Hook Church, Hants, a neat First Pointed building,
designed by Mr. Raphael Brandon, for a congregation of 300,
has been built at a cost of about 4,0001. by Mr. A. Hornby, of
Hook, who has also provided it with an endowment of 3001. a year,
added a parsonage and glebe, and is about to build schools. The
same architect has also just completed a pretty little church
at Bayham, Kent, for the Marquis Camden, its appearance being
not a little enhanced by the charming site it occupies in Bayham
Park, close to the picturesque ruins of Bayham Abbey. The
Marquis of Westminster has erected an elegant church for a
congregation of 300 at Hindon, Wiltshire. It is French First
Pointed in style, and was designed by Mr. T. H. Wyatt. The
parish church of St. Michael, Otterton, Devonshire, has been
rebuilt at a cost of over 8,0001. by Lady Rolle, being the third
erected by her in this locality. Otterton Church was designed
by Mr. B. Ferrey, generally in accordance with the character of

the old church, and is said to be a graceful building : the carved
capitals (of the local fruit and flowers) are especially admired.
St. John the Baptist, Tuebrook, Liverpool, has been erected at a
cost exceeding 15,0001. by the Rev. J. C. and Mrs. Reade, from
the designs of Mr. Bodley. The style is early Second Pointed, a
good deal enriched, especially in the chancel, but the reredos had
to be removed before the Bishop of Chester would consecrate the
church. Of the exterior the most striking feature is the tower,
which with its spire 180 feet high.
As in former years, we refer the other new churches to a
list arranged under First Pointed (agreeing generally with the
Early English), and Second Pointed (or Decorated) styles. When
not otherwise stated, the church may be understood to consist of
a nave and aisles, chancel, vestry, and tower, or tower and
spire ; unless it be a small church, when it will ordinarily have
only nave and chancel, with a bell-turret instead of a tower.

We must now turn for a moment to a less grateful theme-
that of church restoration. Everywhere church restoration is in
progress. An untouched old church is already a rare thing ; soon
such a church will be an object that architects and artists will
think worthy of a long journey to examine. We have seen of late
many of the newly-restored cathedrals and churches, and some
that have numbered a few years since the destructive process was
carried out, and it is curious how all alike bave lost the old air of
sober dignity and hoary venerableness. It is too late, however,
for complaint. The change has been effected, and it is irre-
parable.
With our metropolitan cathedral the restorative process is
only commencing. Last year, in referring to the proposed resto-
ration of St. Paul's, and to the general scheme of decoration which
was then foreshadowed, we asked on behalf of that large section
of the public who regard the church as one of the most distinctive
monuments in London, for “an explicit declaration that the deco-
rations shall be in harmony with Wren's designs, and, in fact, be
merely the completion of them in his own spirit.” Such a decla-
ration has since been made, and it has been authoritatively
announced that it is the earnest desire of the committee to com-
plete and not to alter Wren's design. This is plain and ought to
be satisfactory, and it may appear ungracious not to accept it as
sufficient. But the scheme of decoration, as we understand it,
assuredly goes very far beyond what is known of Wren's plan, or
desire, for the internal decoration of St. Paul's.
Unless the intentions of the Committee are misconceived it is
proposed to apply coloured granite, marbles, mosaics, pictorial
representations, gilding, and other polychromatic decoration
more or less elaborately to almost the entire surface—if the
quarter of a million asked for can be obtained. Now if this
were done, or even a moiety of it, we feel certain that the archi-
tectural character and proportions of the building, its grandeur,
solemnity, and simplicity, would be frittered away, and its very
nature and individuality be modified if not essentially changed.
Assuredly this would be so if the grand scheme of pictorial
decoration, on which so much stress is laid, be adopted ; for that
is in its essence medieval and antagonistic to the idea of a
Protestant Cathedral as Wren conceived it. The scheme may be
right according to the views of ecclesiologists, but it is out of
harmony with the character of St. Paul's ; it would not satisfy
the historical sense of truth and fitness, and still less artistic
judgment. Possibly the scheme may be misunderstood. It has
never been fully and authoritatively laid before the public. If
the Committee are satisfied of its excellence as they surely must
be before determining to spend so large a sum of money upon it,
the time has come when they should publish it in ample detail.
If it be worthy of adoption it will commend itself to the public
mind and silence objectors. If not, there will be opportunity to

amend it, or propose a better. Whilst only vague and con-
tradictory notions are afloat respecting it, the funds for effecting
the restoration or completion will continue to come in slowly.
A full, clear, and precise statement of what is intended might
rekindle the flagging enthusiasm. Meantime why might not the
Committee carry out Mr. Street's excellent suggestion to "first
of all restore it to the state in which it was left by its architect,
by clearing it of dirt and whitewash ” ? We should then be in á
better position to judge what decoration was wanting : possibly
its appearance thus might rather abate the craze after polychromy,
and show that a moiety of the quarter of a million might be
better applied than in the transformation of the interior of St.
Paul's Cathedral.
The restored Chapter House of Westminster Abbey will
shortly be opened to view. The works have been carried out
most conscientiously : more we leave to be said when the build-
ing is cleared of workmen and their apparatus.
At Salisbury Cathedral, the restorative proceedings are now
chiefly occupied with the choir and Lady chapel, where, the con-
structional work having been completed, or nearly so, the roof is
being delicately coloured by Messrs. Clayton and Bell, under
Mr. Scott's supervision. At Exeter Cathedral extensive works
are in progress under the direction of Mr. Scott, by whose advice
the Chapter have decided not to remove the organ screen as was
proposed. The cost of the restoration is estimated at 15,0001.,
towards which the Chapter have subscribed 10,0001. ; the rest
has been added by the county. At Worcester Cathedral the
work of restoration is proceeding apace, under the direction of
Mr. Perkins. The choir has been entirely renovated. The choir
of Gloucester Cathedral has undergone a still more complete
restoration and decoration under the direction of Mr. G. G.
Scott, R.A. It has been three years on hand and about 13,0001.
has been expended upon it. The entire restoration of the
cathedral will cost 45,0001. A good deal has been done at Wells,
but the extent to which restoration has involved the destruction
or rechiselling of the famous statuary on the west front is much
disputed—and we have not seen the building since it has been in
the restorer's hands. At Bristol, Mr. Street goes on steadily
with his work, which is something more, it will be remembered,
than what is generally understood by the term restoration, inas-
much as a new nave and aisles (117 feet long and 80 wide) and
two western towers, each 130 feet high, have to be added to the
old fabric. As far as they have gone, the works we are assured
are entirely satisfactory. About 20,000l. has been spent on
them, and at least as much more will be required. At St. David's
the choir restorations having been completed, the nave and aisles
have been taken in hand, Mr. Scott being the architect under
whose direction the restoration is being effected. At Rochester,
Mr. Scott has begun with restoring the nave and clerestory,
having first satisfied himself as to the general safety of the edifice.
The restoration of the nave and transepts of Bath Abbey

Church, commenced in 1865, under the direction of Mr. G. G.
Scott, R.A., has at length been completed. Much of the work has
been constructive as well as restorative; but it has been carried
out in a conservative spirit. The groining has been laid open and
restored throughout; many of the windows have been renewed ;
galleries have been removed, and the nave has been adapted
for public worship. Another old abbey church, St. Alban’s, long
sadly neglected, yet in many respects the most interesting remain-
ing, this year gave warning of imminent danger. Happily,
though the sum required to ensure its safety was beyond the
means of the townsmen, the county magnates recognised the
urgency, and a sufficient amount was guaranteed to enable Mr.
Scott to perform such work as was necessary to preserve the
building. But he stated that it would cost 46,000l. to put the
church into the condition in which it ought to be, and an
appeal has been made for assistance to the country at large,
which is being liberally responded to. Every one interested in
our national antiquities will sympathize with the desire for the
preservation, future security, and adequate restoration of St.
Alban's Abbey Church, but we cannot but feel that there is
danger from the ambition of the restorers. On such a work the
hand of the restorer should be laid reverently. Every touch of
the ancient workmen should be carefully preserved, and no new
work should be added that is not positively necessary. Above all,
modern mock mediæval ornamentation should be regarded as
desecration. It is proposed to adapt the nave for congregational
service. Whatever is requisite for that should be done : nothing
The several sections of Dissenters have been active in building,
but we do not find among them as yet any very near approach to
an ideal excellence in church or chapel. Some still sternly refuse
to adopt the Gothic fashion, but they instead merely adhere to an
earlier habit. In all it is imitative work. Only in the adapta-
tion of the interiors of their places of worship to congregational
purposes they somewhat excel.
The primary requisites with
them are always that the preacher shall be seen and heard, that
the listeners shall listen in comfort. The following may be taken
as examples of the Congregational churches and chapels com-
pleted during the past year. Near London, Stamford Hill Chapel
is an example of the orthodox form in favour with well-to-do
congregations. It is a cruciform church, has nave, aisles, and
an apsidal chancel, and a lofty tower and spire; is Second Pointed
in style; constructed of Kentish rag and Bath stone, and will,
with the galleries, accommodate about 1,400 persons. Vestries,
a lecture hall, and kitchen, and chapel-keeper's rooms are attached,
and the whole has cost £13,000 ; architects, Messrs. Tarring and
Sons. The same architects, have built a similar and scarcely less
costly Gothic chapel at Walthamstow, for a congregation of 800.
In this a steeple 150 feet high is the most conspicuous feature of
the exterior. A First Pointed chapel of stock brick with bands
of red and blue brick and Bath stone dressings, erected by
more.

Mr. Tabberer, at New Hampton, may serve as a sample of the
humbler but more numerous class.
Of country chapels we may note-St. Peter's Hill
, Grantham;
First Pointed in style ; of Ancaster stone, lined with brick ;
comprising nave and aisles divided by cast-iron columns with
stone bases and capitals, an organ bay on the north, vestries,
and a turret 70 feet high at the south-west angle. It has 600
sittings, and with a minister's house, cost something over 4,000l.
The architect was Mr. J. Tait, of Leicester; who has also built
a neat but inexpensive First Pointed chapel at Aylestone, near
Leicester, and one or two elsewhere. North-street chapel,
Brighton, is a more elaborate early Second Pointed building,
designed by Mr. J. Wimble, displaying symbolic carvings,
polished granite shafts, painted glass windows and various
other decorative features. Other chapels have been erected at
Stapleton Road, Bristol, Italian in style, with 1,000 seats, de-
signed by Mr. H. F. Price, of Weston-super-Mare. Halifax-
road, Dewsbury, classical in style : 1,000 sittings, cost 8,0001.,
architects Messrs. Kirk. At Southsea ; late First Pointed ;
cruciform ; 670 seats, architect Mr. Stent, of Warminster, &c.
Among the Wesleyan Methodists the desire for increased
vigour in chapel building, found emphatic expression at the
recent Conference at Manchester, and it was announced that
Sir Frances Lycett had arranged to give 50,000l. for the erection
of new chapels in London, provided an equal amount could be
provided in the provinces, and of this it was added 26,0001. had
already been raised. "Four chapels were then erecting in London,
and it was hoped before the end of the year that the first ten
chapels which they proposed would really be commenced.”
Opinion in the Conference was unfavourable to Gothic “because
it was generally difficult for a preacher to be well heard in a
Gothic structure ; but the conclusion arrived at was that “the
people who built the chapels, and who would have to worship in
them, should be left to choose the style of architecture.”
Most actual progress has however been made in the country.
At Doncaster a chapel in the Italian style, capable of accommo-
dating 1,000 persons, has been erected from the designs of Mr.
Watson of Wakefield, at a cost of 7,8001. At Wakefield, one by
the same architect, but Gothic in style, of red brick with stone
dressings, for 400 adults and 200 children. At Cambridge, one
of very orthodox Gothic, designed by Messrs. Hill and Swann
of Sheffield, for 700 persons, at a cost of 4,0001. At Bowling,
near Bradford, Yorkshire, Italian in style, designed by Messrs.
Andrews and Pepper, for a congregation of 500 ; cost 4,0001.
At Middleton-in-Teesdale ; Italian ; architect Mr. Ranger of
Lewes. At Throckley, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne; First Pointed
in style
; 245 seats, cost about 1,0001., defrayed by Mr. Stephen-
son of Throckley. At Hipperholme, North Riding of Yorkshire ;
architects, Messrs. Ives, cost 2, 2001.' At New Brighton, Liverpool,
from the designs of Mr. H. H. Vale of Liverpool. At
Launceston ; First Pointed with a good deal of internal decora-

tion ; 700 sittings ; architects Messrs. Hine and Norton of
Plymouth. At Grimsbury, near Banbury, classic in style, de-
signed by Mr. Hackett of Banbury; and others at Wike, at
Akroydon, Halifax, and elsewhere. The Primitive and other
sections of the Methodist body have also built several chapels,
but none that call for special notice.
The most important chapel erected by the Baptists in London
or its vicinity is one at Stoke Newington to accommodate the
congregation of Devonshire-square chapel, Bishopsgate. The
building is First Pointed in style, and comprises nave, aisles,
chancel, and galleries, with a tower and spire 125 feet high. It
was designed by Mr. T. C. Clark, and has cost 7,5001. A New
Tabernacle is making rapid progress in Burdett-roai, Stepney, a
sort of fosterchild of Mr. Spurgeon's Tabernacle, which may
possess some interest for those concerned in congregational archi-
tecture, since it is to be constructed wholly with a view to con-
gregational purposes and to afford accommodation for at least
4,000 persons : but as far as it has proceeded the exterior makes
no pretence to architectural effect. Among the country chapels
the following may be mentioned : Glossop Road, Sheffield ; Second
Pointed in style, with considerable interior decoration, including
a painted glass window over the baptistery ; 820 seats, cost
6,5001. : architects, Messrs. Innocent and Brown of Sheffield.
Carey Chapel, Reading ; erected from the designs of Messrs.
Searle and Son, at a cost of 3,0001. Fabius Chapel, Everton,
Liverpool ; of red and white brick ; Italian in style ; architect,
Mr. W. Penney of Liverpool ; 550 seats, cost 2,2001. Mint-lane,
Lincoln ; Gothic ; 580 seats ; architects, Messrs. Drury and
Mortimer of Lincoln. Other chapels have been built at Droit-
wich and elsewhere, but these examples will suffice.
Several Presbyterian chapels have been erected. The following
will serve to show their character, and that the old antipathy to
steeple-houses”
” has completely subsided. Ipswich, of Kentish
rag with Bath-stone dressings ; Second Pointed ; cruciform, with
an apsidal termination, and a square tower and stone spire 125
feet high ; 500 sittings, cost about 3,000l. ; architect, Mr. F.
Barnes. Whitefield Memorial Church, Gloucester ; Second
Pointed ; of white brick, with red bricks in bands and patterns,
and over the principal entrance a representation in low relief of
Whitefield preaching ; tower and spire 140 feet high ; architects,
Messrs. Medland of Gloucester.
It is worth recording here that a church, St. Nicolai, has been
erected for the use of the Danish, Norwegian, and other Scandi-
navian residents in Hull and the seamen visiting the port. It is
Continental Gothic and has the proper national symbols, but it
would have been desirable to impress its nationality more
distinctly upon it. The architect was Mr. Botterill of Hull.
But though_this is the first Danish Lutheran Church con-
secrated in England, the first stone of another to be called the
Scandinavian Seamen's Church, Surrey Commercial Docks, was
laid by Prince Oscar, during his visit here last summer.

The Roman Catholics have not been the least busy in church
building, but with them it is so much the custom to proceed by
stages that it is not easy to mark the period of completion. In
London we have noted only two new churches, both Gothic, and
of a somewhat sombre type-a large church at Bow, designed by
Mr. Blount; and the Oratory of the Convent of the Assumption,
Kensington Square, designed by Mr. G. Goldie, as the first
section of a much larger church. In the country churches bave
been consecrated among other places at Stranbrook, near Wor-
cester; designed by Mr. E. W. Pugin, as the first instalment of
a large Benedictine Abbey. At Oldcoats ; Second Pointed ; of
local stone, designed by Mr. S. J. Nicholls. At Newton Abbot.
a First Pointed building designed by Mr. J. W. Rowell ; at
Darlington and elsewhere.
A Jewish Synagogue has been erected at Bristol, from the
designs of Mr. Collins, with some attention to architectural
character; and another at Newport, South Wales : but our
limits forbid us to dwell longer on this section.
4. BUILDINGS FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.
Liverpool Exchange, of which we gave an engraving and
description in the Companion' for 1870 (pp. 164–7), has been
completed, and the Board of Directors passed a resolution con-
gratulating the architect, Mr. T. H. Wyatt on the creditable and
satisfactory manner in which the problem of reconciling the re-
quirements of commercial offices with the importance of a large
public building has been solved. The praise was well deserved.
The building is a noble one, and creditable not only to the archi-
tect but to the public spirit of the Liverpool merchants who
enabled him to carry out so large and costly a work to a satisfac-
tory termination. Rochdale Town Hall, described and engraved
in the Companion' for 1868, pp. 168–9, has also been formally
opened. The building, a large and richly decorated Gothic one,
designed by Mr. W. H. Crossland, is greatly admired ; and,
standing in a fine open space of about 20 acres, it forms a con-
spicuous ornament to the town. The cost of the building and
ground is said to have been about 100,0001.-which speaks well
for the liberality as well as the prosperity of Rochdale. The
magnificent new Town Hall, Manchester, advances steadily, but
the progress of such a work must of necessity be slow. The
Manchester Royal Exchange has also made considerable progress.
The Exchange proper promises to be a splendid saloon. Brad-
ford Town Hall has likewise made good progress.
A new Town-hall has been opened at Wareham. It is
Gothic building of red brick and stone, the lower part being
appropriated to a Corn-exchange the upper to the Town-hall and
magistrates' rooms. The architect was Mr. Crickmay, of Wey-
mouth. A Town-hall and market-house has been completed at
Abergavenny from the designs of Messrs. Wilson and Wilcox.
The building is large and Gothic in style, and constructed, the

a
Town-hall of local stone, the market of brick; and it is at once
ornamental in appearance and convenient in its arrangements.
The new Market-hall at Newton, Montgomeryshire, a brick and
stone building, Lombardic in style, designed by Mr. D. Walker,
is described as the largest for market purposes in the principality.
At Elsecar, Yorkshire, Earl Fitzwilliam has built, at his sole
expense, a spacious covered market-ball ; and others are being
built at Howden and elsewhere. Cattle markets have been com-
pleted at Chichester, from the designs of Mr. Hawksley; at
Melton Mowbray, designed by Mr. R. W. Johnson, and in one
or two other places. A new corn exchange has been commenced
at Rochester, and several others have been begun or projected.
Having in recent volumes described at length the new St.
Thomas's Hospital, on the southern embankment of the Thames,
it only remains to record its formal opening by the Queen. Of
the building itself, the ability displayed in its construction and
arrangement, and its architectural shortcomings, we have nothing
further to say.
As a great metropolitan hospital we trust it will
be completely successful. If it should in any way fail it will
furnish additional evidence that the collection of such large
numbers of sick persons together is a sanitary mistake. Nothing
has at any rate been knowingly neglected, and no expense has
been spared to make St. Thomas's Hospital as nearly as possible
perfect. The cost has necessarily been very large, in all not less
than 500,0001., but of this a sum of 100,0001. was paid to the
Metropolitan Board of Works for the site, which it may be
recollected was reclaimed from the Thames by the embank-
ment.
A large fever hospital is in course of completion in the Leeds
Road, Bradford, a Gothic building of picturesque outline designed
by Messrs. Andrews and Pepper. The Horton Memorial Hos-
pital, Banbury, is a large and handsome building, Domestic
Gothic in style, of red and black bricks with Bath-stone dressings,
designed by Mr. C. H. Driver, and comprises a central adminis-
trative block with a lofty tower, and two wings for the patients.
The Alsop Memorial Hospital, Leek, is a neat red brick and
stone building, designed by Mr. Sugden, with careful regard to
improved medical and sanitary requirements. At Macclesfield,
a very large hospital or infirmary has been erected from the
designs of Mr. İ. Stevens, but left unoccupied and unfitted
owing, we believe, to failure of funds, although a bequest of
30,000l. will be forfeited if it be not handed over to the trustees
ready for service and free from debt by 1875. Macclesfield will,
however, hardly allow that to happen.
At Brooklands, Huddersfield, a spacious and stately building,
designed by Mr. E. Birchall, of Leeds, has been erected, provided
with an endowment of 25,0001., and presented as a Convalescent
Home for Huddersfied District, by Mr. Charles Brook, of Meltham
Mills. The building, which is a pleasing Domestic Gothic
edifice with a frontage 190 feet long, stands on Meal Hill, at the
head of a cheerful valley which the Messrs. Brook have converted

Architecture and Public Improvements. 165
into a recreation ground for the Meltham workpeople. The
sanitary arrangements of the new hospital have been carefully
considered, all the best recent appliances furnished, and pleasure
ground of eleven acres are attached. Room is provided for
the patients in the church at Meltham Mills, which was also built
by the Messrs. Brook.
Other convalescent hospitals have been begun, improved, or
completed, and we are glad to see that their value is becoming
more generally recognised. We also rejoice to observe that
cotta hospitals are on the increase.
Buildings have been
erected, or houses adapted for the purpose, in Surrey and Lan-
caster, Cornwall and Durham, and a great many intermediate
places and everywhere favourable reports are returned of their
working.
A large range of buildings has been opened in the vicinity of
Macclesfield as a lunatic asylum. At present the asylum, which
has cost 120,000l., makes provision for 250 inmates, but it will
eventually receive 700. The buildings cover an area of 9} acres,
are in four blocks connected by covered ways, are built of red
brick and stone, Italian in style, are well fitted throughout, and
stand in the midst of 80 acres of garden grounds.
That excellent institution, the London Orphan Asylum, finding
its old neighbourhood, Clapton, becoming too crowded and sur-
rounded with factories, has removed to the more open country
and
purer air of Watford-a locality that has become a favourite
spot for asylums and benevolent institutions. The new Orphan
Asylum consists of a series of nine houses (of course in the
fashionable brick Gothic) each for fifty children, grouped about
the administrative block, in which is the great hall 108 feet by
50, and which has a clock tower 125 feet high, and the chapel a
very pretty one, built at the sole cost of a lady who was brought
up in the asylum, and afterwards served it as head-mistress. Mr.
H. Dawson was the architect. A very neat range of buildings
has just been completed near the Alexandra Orphanage, Hornsey
Rise, for the Aged Pilgrim's Friend Society. All unnecessary
ornament has been avoided, the building is a comparatively in-
expensive one, yet on the whole it seems to us that the architect,
Mr. Boreham, has succeeded in making it one of the most com-
fortable, cheerful-looking, and convenient homes for aged and
infirm pensioners we have seen for some time.
Extensive and well-arranged baths have been erected at
Southport, from the designs of Messrs. Horton and Bridgford,
at a cost of about 23,0001. Public baths have been constructed at
Harrogate by the Improvement Commissioners at a cost of
20,0001. ; at Brighton, and in one or two other places, but their
number increases far too slowly. An excellent example has just
been set to other institutions by Rossall School which has erected
baths on a large scale, the swimming bath being over 122 feet
long, 30 feet wide, and deepening from 4 feet at one end to 6 feet
6 inches at the other and is of course available for swimming
throughout the year,

5.—BUILDINGS CONNECTED WITH EDUCATION, ART, &c.
The buildings for the Charter-house School in course of erection
near Godalming, Surrey, are assuming sufficient distinctness to
allow a tolerably correct judgment to be formed of them. Through
the courtesy of the architect, Mr. P. C. Hardwick, F.S.A., who
kindly lent us drawings, we are enabled to give an accurate
representation of the principal quadrangle, as it will appear when
finished, the design having been considerably modified since it
was originally published in the professional journals, 1869-70.
As will be seen the style is that of the best period of Collegiate
Gothic, and the chief points of interest are the hall, central gate-
tower, and the chapel, which forms the right wing of the quad-
rangle, and is flanked by a massive tower. The chief modifica-
tion of the design has been in the way of simplicity and sym-
metry, and as it seems to us with manifest advantage to the
general effect. The single great window in the gable of the
chapel is a decided improvement on the two smaller windows
originally proposed. So is the admission of the large central
gable to the left of the gate-tower. The buildings are constructed
of the local green sandstone, with dressings of Bath stone. The
central portion of the building is appropriated to the foundation
scholars, who will each have a separate sleeping-room or cubi-
culum.“ Adjoining are the studies; near at hand a suite of rooms
for boys on the temporary sick-list, and great care has been taken
with the sanitary arrangements, as well as with the school
matters. Provision is made for sixty foundation scholars, and
for 100 boys in the houses of the head master and the second
master. The chapel will ultimately accommodate 600 scholars,
besides the masters and their families and visitors, but at first
only 300 boys will find seats. Generally provision is made in
the plan for the future extension of the school, the erection of
additional masters' houses, an isolated infirmary, the completion
of the chapel, &c. The buildings are so arranged that in bad
weather the boys, at whatever part of the building they reside,
may pass to the school-rooms, hall, or chapel, without going into
the rain. The grounds purchased by the trustees are over 70
acres in extent, and of this eight acres have been converted into
an excellent cricket ground. The non-academic portion of the
Charter-house, or Sutton's Hospital proper, will remain, at least
for the present, undisturbed in the well-known old buildings;
but the old school buildings have been purchased by the Merchant
Taylors' Company, whose school will be removed there as soon
as the Charter-house boys migrate to Godalming.
Another once famous Grammar School has removed to a new
abode, and is starting, as is hoped, on a new career of prosperity.
The new Reading School just opened outside the old town is a
spacious, well-arranged, and picturesque Gothic building, de-
signed by Mr. A. Waterhouse, and completed at a cost of about
25,0001. A new Grammar School is approaching completion at
Maidstone, under the direction of Mr. E. W. Stephens. It is a

Collegiate Gothic building, with provision for foundation scholars,
boarders, and day scholars; and has a great school-room for 180
boys, besides class rooms, master's house, &c. By the liberality
of the Duke of Devonshire, a spacious semi-Gothic building has
been erected from the designs of Mr. H. Currey, for Eastbourne
College, Sussex. A middle class
day-school for 300 boys, in
connection with the Whitgift Hospital, Croydon, has been
erected from the designs of Mr. A. Blomfield, at a cost of about
£15,000; it is of course a Gothic building ; its principal external
feature is a tall central entrance-tower of very good design.
Under the directions of the new School Boards there is about
to commence a period of unwonted activity in the building of
Primary Schools. Our business is to record what has been
accomplished or is in progress, and therefore we make no further
reference to this auspicious movement. But we take the oppor-
tunity to call the earnest attention of the members of School Boards,
school architects, and all interested in the construction of new
primary schools to a series of practical suggestions made in the
Companion to the Almanac for 1863 (pp. 263–66), on the work-
ing arrangements in such buildings. They embody the results
of the experience of one of the ablest, most observant, and
most thoughtful schoolmasters of our time, and if carried out
would add immensely to the usefulness of the schools and the
comfort of both teachers and scholars.
Of class institutions the most important of the year is the
Indian Civil Engineers' College, Cooper's Hill. On the spot
immortalized by Denham was a fine mansion and grounds
which the Government purchased for the purpose of carrying out
their educational experiment. The house was a large and nearly
new one (designed by Messrs. Francis) but not nearly large
enough for the College, and it was remodelled and greatly
added to by their architect, Sir Digby Wyatt, and is now a con-
venient collegiate building, with provision for the residence and
instruction of 150 students, president, professors, and staff of
officials. A block of buildings affording accommodation for thirty
students, with library, class rooms, &c.,
has been formally opened
at the Countess of Huntingdon’s Theological College, Cheshunt.
The new building, 121 feet long, 26 feet deep, and three storeys
high, is of brick, with Bath-stone arches, mouldings, and dress-
ings, Collegiate Gothic in style, very freely treated, and has at
the western extremity, a square entrance tower, with a tall
pyramidal roof, 100 feet high. The architects were Messrs.
Lander and Bedells.
At the Universities, building has hardly been carried on
with such vigour as in some previous years. Cambridge has
been by far the most active. St. John's has added some statues
to its chapel and completed the new buildings. At Christ's
College several new rooms have been built. The chapel of
Corpus Christi College has been enlarged and transformed in
accordance with current ecclesiological ideas.
The most im-
portant event of the year has however been the completion of the

works at Caius, the aspect of which has been entirely changed.
Mr. Waterhouse, was the architect, and he is generally allowed
to have produced a noble building, though the style, in order
to harmonize with the other buildings, is English Renaissance,
and consequently very different in character to that in which he has
been accustomed to work. The same architect has added a wing
to Jesus College, of red brick, like the other buildings. He has
also undertaken extensive additions to Pembroke College.
"Trinity College, having restored its chapel, is about to expend
several thousand pounds in decorating its magnificent library ;
and extensive works are spoken of as about to be commenced by
other Colleges, King's being of the number.
A new Library and Lecture Theatre, the latter for 300 persons,
has been opened in connection with the Halifax Literary and
Philosophical Institute. A neat red brick and stone building
has been opened as a Free Library, at Wallingford, Berkshire ;
the reading room will accommodate 300 persons. At that
remarkable new Yorkshire town, Saltaire, a large and hand-
some new building, Italian in style, with statuary and carving
on the front, and large and elegant rooms inside, has been
erected for the Saltaire Club and Institute, at a cost of 23,0001.
It forms one side of a square, opposite the schools, with which
it harmonizes in style. The architects were Messrs. Lockwood
and Mawson, who have designed the whole of the buildings in
Saltaire.
During the last two or three years there has been something
like a mania for new theatres in London, but most of these
lately opened have been modifications of existing buildings, like
the Court Theatre, Sloane Square, and the Circus, Argyll Street,
Oxford Street; or have no claim on the ground architectural
character to a place among public improvements. Some of 2
more ambitious kind are however contemplated, and one, tle
Criterion, Piccadilly, a kind of combination of theatre, music
hall, and restaurant, on an imposing scale, has, we believe been
commenced. In the country the most important new theatre is
the Queen's at Manchester, designed by Mr. E. Salomons, who
had already proved his capacity in this line at Liverpool. The
auditorium differs somewhat from the customary horse-shoe, and
is pronounced superior. It is of considerable size, the pit seating
1,300 persons, the gallery 800, and the boxes á proportionate
number. The proscenium is 30 feet square, the stage 42 feet
deep; the general appearance is described as pleasing, the seeing
and hearing qualities as excellent. At Reading a building has been
erected called the Theatre Royal and Albert Hall, which is to
serve the double purpose of a theatre and concert room : it will
accommodate 1,000 persons.

an aspect of new life, vigour, and beauty to it, add for years
new furrows and leave deep traces of waste and desolation. For
long years Victoria Street, Westminster, and Victoria Street,
Holborn, model streets as they were pronounced, and useful as
great arteries for traffic, presented scenes of dreary ruin that no
one could expect to witness in a city like London. Little has
even yet been done to fill up the vacant places, and nothing
systematically. Now, however, it is proposed to complete Vic-
toria Street, Westminster, by the erection of ranges of Gothic
mansions, designed by Mr. E. W. Pugin, to be let out as
chambers ; and Victoria Street, Holborn, under its altered de-
signation, as Farringdon Road is having one and another scattered
warehouse built along it, and in connection with the Holborn
Viaduct, may even grow into, importance. As yet, however,
Holborn Viaduct with its approaches and connected streets has
only added to the waste places of the city. The newest Queen
Victoria Street, the eastward continuation of the Thames
Embankment, has not, so far, fared better than its predecessors,
although, unlike them, it lies in the very centre of City traffic.
The Mansion House Buildings at the junction of the new street
with the Poultry, are in fact the only block of buildings erecter!
along it, except the Bible Society's House and the Probate Office
at the Blackfriars end. Mansion House Buildings, designed by
Messrs. Belcher, form a very pretentious structure, Gothic of
peculiar but elaborate and highly decorated character. The
ground floor is a range of six shops, the only break being an
ornate entrance to the chambers in Queen Victoria Street.
Above the shops are four storeys with some 24 windows in each,
except the attic which has dormers wider apart. The acute
angle at the junction of the streets is rounded off, and this
circular end is prolonged upwards into a tower which is crowned
with a tall spire. Altogether, though somewhat florid in itseli
and entirely out of keeping with the surrounding buildings,
the structure has a striking effect and the sky-line tells well in
approaching it from the east. But in it the old difficulty of the
London street architect is certainly not solved. The shops have
the thinnest of shafts between them, the huge sheets of plate
glass are held by the slightest franiework, every inch of window-
space having to be husbanded for the display of goods, and con-
sequently you have an enormous mass of masonry in the upper
storeys supported on what appears to be the flimsiest and most
fragile base. The offices of the Union Bank, Holborn Circus,
and the large draper's shop on the opposite side of the way-the
former somewhat severely classic the latter florid Renaissance---
are the two most important buildings erected on the main line of
the Holborn Viaduct; on the sideways little more has been done.
About Farringdon Street two or three houses have been built
with some attention to architectural character, and an unusually
ornamental tavern, the King Lud, in the new circus, Ludgato
Street.
Around the Bank and Royal Exchange some new offices hare

a
been erected, and offices and warehouses in other parts of the
City. The Imperial Ottoman Bank, Throgmorton Street, Mr. W.
Burnet, architect, is a small but rich and solid building, in which
on a classic basis the oriental character has been distinctively im-
pressed. A house in Cornhill, the India agency department of
the business of Messrs. Smith & Elder, now Messrs. Kings', like
the bank just noticed of comparatively narrow frontage, is also
noteworthy as exhibiting some distinctive character. Great
apparent solidity is here secured by having the piers of the
ground floor of considerable width, and with the architrave of
tooled granite. Above this are five storeys, all of which, except
the attic, are faced with terra-cotta : here, again, the decoration
assuming a markedly oriental character. Without being entirely
satisfactory, the façade is effective and suggestive, and should it
resist the attacks of the City atmosphere, will establish the value
of terra-cotta as a decorative material in street architecture.
Other houses, shops, and offices, we may leave, in order to
notice briefly the very remarkable addition made to London archi-
tecture by the St. Pancras Station of the Midland Railway. In
previous years we have spoken of the railway terminus proper
with its unrivalled roof, extensive platforms and labyrinth of
columns, vaults, and underground compartments, and taken note
of the progress of the great hotel which forms the street front of
the station. The character of this immense structure will be
best understood by the engraving, in which the courtesy of the
architect, Mr. G. G. Scott R.A., in supplying the necessary ma-
terials, has enabled us to render correctly those parts of the
building which are as yet unfinished. The building is of a deep
red brick and stone; the style, as will be seen, First Pointed, of
domestic character, and with French affinities. How far this
style will be found adapted to modern wants and purposes will
here be fairly tested. If it answers for a London railway station
and hotel, its capability for almost any purpose, may be assumed.
From its vast size the building cannot fail to be imposing. But
apart from that its effect is very fine. The appropriateness of
parts may be questioned, but the general excellence is beyond
dispute. At present the western end, the advanced portion
shown on the left of the engraving, is incomplete, and the interior
is, so to speak, untouched; the unbuilt western portion being
that which will contain the state apartments of the hotel, includ-
ing a splendid public room 100 feet long, 26 feet wide, and
26 feet high. In splendour, the principal rooms will rival the
exterior, and altogether there can be little doubt it will be the
most magnificent structure of the kind in the country. From the
engraving a tolerable notion will be obtained of the vast size of
the structure, but a few figures will make this clearer. The entire
length of the front will be 565 feet, of which about 170 remain
to be built; the height of the parapet (without the roof) is 80
feet; the clock tower, on the right of the engraving, is 270 feet
high, the central tower will be over 200 feet;
the depth of the
building to the railway platform is 66 feet. The space covered

by it will be about 2,500 square yards. The terminus proper,
behind the hotel, is on a scale of proportionate magnitude ; the
roof, which is slightly pointed to harmonize with the Gothic
front, being 700 feet long and 240 feet in span, the rafters rising
100 feet from the platform, and the vast space being unbroken
by ties or braces. The floor of the station is borne on plate
girders which are supported on 690 cast iron pillars; the area
beneath the station floor, comprising stores for pale ale and
other heavy goods, as well as the lines connecting the Midland
with the Metropolitan Railway. The engineer was Mr. W. H.
Barlow, C.E., but the details of the roof were entrusted to
Mr. Ordish. The area required for the new terminus of the
Great Eastern Railway, stretching from Broad Street eastward
to Sun Street, is now cleared, and in magnitude this station
appears likely to rival any yet constructed in London.
We have barely space left to mention, certainly not to describe,
the various street improvements made and making in our larger
country towns. Conspicuous in this direction is Bristol, with
the fine new approach to the city from the Great Western station,
happily displacing the mean streets through which the traveller
had previously to pass ; many handsome storehouses, offices, and
shops, have also been erected in the old city. Manchester has
been widening some of its narrow streets, and erecting a hand-
some new Reform Club-house at the top of King-street, as well
as many new and good business houses, in addition to the im-
portant municipal works on hand. Liverpool is also busy archi-
tecturally as well as commercially. Among the Yorkshire towns.
Bradford is conspicuous for both private and public buildings,
but report tells of good work in progress at Leeds, Halifax,
Barnsley, and other towns.
As examples of what is being done in the provinces, we may
point to one class of buildings—the banks. One of the most
noteworthy for boldness and originality of treatment is Brooks's
Bank, Manchester, erected from the designs of Mr. Truefitt, at a
cost of about 26,0001., and of which the most striking external
feature is a portico carried out far enough to permit carriages to-
pass beneath it.
At Hull a stately Italian edifice has beek
erected from the designs of Mr. Botterill for the Hull Banking
Company. The National Provincial Banking Company have nearly
completed a large and very ornate bank at Newcastle-upon-Tyne ;
and commenced others at Gateshead and Middlesborough. The
buildings are classical Italian in style, and by the same architect,
Mr. J. Gibson, already favourably known by the bank erected by
him a few years back for the same company in Bishopsgate
Within. At Burslem a spacious bank has been completed for the
Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company; it is of
brick and stone, Gothic in style, and forms a detached block, the
principal front faeing the Market Place : the architects were
Messrs. Barker and Ellis of Manchester. The appearance of the
Market Place, Bishop's Auckland, has been improved by the
erection of a Gothic bank (Messrs. Backhouse and Co.'s), which

has received warm local commendation; the architect was Mr. G.
G. Hoskins of Darlington, At Ossett a bank, classical in style,
has been built for the Wakefield and Barnsley Union Company ;
and others in several other places.
7. BRIDGES, DOCKS, ETC.
The vast works which have been for several years in course
of construction for the extension of Portsmouth and Chatham
Docks are now hastening towards completion. At Portsmouth
an area of 180 acres, land, water, and mudland included, has been
taken in for the dockyard extension, and the works have been on
a scale of great magnitude and presented important engineering
problems. They include, besides wharfages and all necessary
appliances, a tidal basin ten acres in area, with an inclosing
wall 76 feet in width ; a deep dock, 450 feet long and 100 feet
wide ; two locks, each 562 feet long and 100 feet wide; a repair-
ing basin, 1,330 feet long, with a depth of 30 feet of water at high
tides; and four or five other docks, 500 feet long and 110 wide,
with entrances 80 feet wide. At Chatham the first of the three
great basins for iron-clad steamships has been formally opened,
and the others greatly advanced. The three basins occupy an
area of 380 acres, being more than four times the area of the
present dockyard, which is only about 90 acres. The Repairing
Basin, now finished, has an area of 22 acres, and is connected
with four dry docks, of which two are completed. It has an
extreme length of 468 feet, is 80 feet wide at the entrance, and
has a depth of from 30 to 32 feet at high tides. The works here
will cost little short of two millions sterling.
At Bristol two large docks are in course of construction, one
between the Avon and Cumberland Basin, and the other between
the basin and the floating harbour. They are each 350 feet long
and 62 feet wide, and are being constructed in the m
solid man-
ner under the direction of Mr. T. Howard, C.E. They have been
long talked of, and are now forming to counteract, in some
measure, the influence of the extensive new docks in course of
construction at the mouth of the Avon under the direction of
Mr. Brunlees, C.E. Among similar schemes which have been
started, is one for new docks at Berwick-upon-Tweed, which, if
carried out, may do much to revive and develope the commerce
of the old town.
We may record here the completion of Portland Breakwater,
by the deposition of the last stone, without parade or closing
ceremony, on the 4th of March, 1871. Among municipal and
private works of this class the extensive works undertaken by the
Port and Haven Commissioners for the improvement of Great
Yarmouth Harbour deserve honourable mention. Iron piers
are erecting at Hunstanton, Redcar, and several other places ;
a company has even been formed for erecting one at Herne Bay,
and has proceeded so far as to remove with no little labour the
decayed old wooden pier.

( the rigid
Returning to London we may note that a useful iron pier has
been erected at the Lambeth end of the Southern Embankment,
for the use of Thames steamers and watermen's ferry boats.
Higher up the river a beginning has been made with the long
talked-of Albert Bridge from the Cadogan Pier, Chelsea, to Prince
Albert Road on the opposite shore. It will be on
suspension principle" of Mr. R. M. Ordish, C.E., who is engineer
to the company.
At Nottingham, the picturesque old bridge over the Trent
has given place to a more convenient new one of stone and iron
designed by the borough surveyor, Mr. M. O. Tarbotton, C.E.
It is a structure of pleasing appearance ; 700 feet long and
40 feet wide between the parapets, the three main arches
being
each of 100 feet span; it has cost the borough over 30,0001. The
Severn, at Stourport, has been spanned by an iron bridge, from
wbich a viaduct of brick and stone has been formed for a con-
siderable distance on either side. In all the viaduct consists of
45 segmental arches; the centre arch which crosses the river
having a clear span of 155 feet. It was erected from the designs
and under the superintendence of Mr. E. Wilson, C.E. At Bath-
ampton a stone bridge of eight Gothic arches, each of 30 feet
span, has been constructed across the Avon by Mr. E. Hill, of
Bath.
Even this imperfect summary of what has been accomplished
during the past year will have sufficed to show that not only has
there been no real decline in any important department of archi-
tecture or public improvement, but that signs of increased activity
are everywhere apparent, and that there has been marked and
satisfactory progress. Although the taste displayed in particular
buildings may be questionable, and our architecture generally be
based possibly on an erroneous artistic principle, it is beyond dis-
pute that more attention is given to architectural effect than at
any previous period, and that this extends to classes of buildings
in which anything but utility was until lately quite ignored. In
engineering works we see more sobriety of judgment, combined
with a wider development and 'more constant application of
scientific resources and constructive skill. The principles of
sanitary science are becoming better understood and more widely
practised. Town drainage is seen to be insufficient, unless con-
sidered in connection with the disposal of the sewage on the land,
the freeing of rivers and watercourses from pollution, and
ensuring an ample supply of pure water : and along with all this,
the provision of better dwellings for the industrial classes, of open
spaces and recreation grounds, of sufficient bathing-places, and
generally of whatever tends to promote the health of town popu-
lations. In a word, if we have yet much to learn in the domain
of art, we are raising buildings which command respect and
admiration, and are achieving many and various useful and
honourable public improvements.

METROPOLITAN CHARITIES AT THE PRESENT DAY.
The use and abuse of public charity is a subject which has
long called for the earnest attention of statesmen and philan-
thropists, and although it is impossible to hope that it will receive
any practical discussion during the ensuing session, which is
already over-weighted with measures of vital importance, it may
fairly be assumed that it will ere long appear in the political pro-
gramme. Primary education is to a considerable extent legis-
lated for. The machinery for carrying out the scheme of the
Education Minister is in working order, objectors of every class,
from those who hate religion down to those who hate music, have
been satisfied, if not absolutely pleased by the conciliatory spirit
which has animated the Government in dealing with this complex
question, and the next Report will enable us to judge how far
the anticipations of the Committee of Council are likely to be
realized. At any rate ignorance will no longer be a misfortune,
but in more ways than one it will come under the category of actual
crime, for unless the system in its reality proves very different
to that which it appears to be on paper, no man in England will
henceforth have any excuse for allowing his children to grow up
without the advantages of a certain amount of teaching and train-
ing. Scarcely less important is the subject of Local Government,
to which Mi. Goschen was directing his energies when he was
removed from the Poor Law Board, and which, to those who have
given it even the most cursory consideration, stands out in all its
naked ugliness as a very cancer in the national body. Intimately
connected as it is with alms-giving in all its branches, it will
naturally claim prior notice in the House of Commons, inasmuch
as the blundering of guardians and vestrymen and the waste of
local taxation inevitably result in an increase of poverty, and a cor-
responding demand upon those large-hearted individuals who are
too often called upon for assistance in cases where, if the rates
were properly expended, they never would be applied to at all.
Mal-administration in one form or other is the cause of half
the misery existing in our large towns, and the man who reforms
the Poor Laws will therefore, to a very great extent, pave the
way for a subsequent inquiry into the conduct of our charitable
institutions. There are, in fact, no two points on which the
majority of Englishmen are so lamentably ignorant as on the dis-
tribution of the local rates, which they grumble at paying but
pay nevertheless, and the disbursement of the funds poured into
the exchequers of the numberless religious societies and benevo-
lent funds. An additional penny on the income tax, even if
there be a logical excuse for the impost, is sure to cause an uproar
in the country, although it only produces in the gross about a
million and a half sterling, and yet the ordinary British house-
holder will submit to far leavier burdens when they are laid
ụpon his shoulders by his neighbours, and will not venture to
inquire into the metto:d by which his money is expended. So

too with our great charities. Those who scan narrowly the de-
bates on Imperial balance-sheets, and make an effort to fathom
the depths of the finance accounts annually furnished by the
Treasury, seldom take the trouble to look into the arrangements
of the societies to which they contribute, although perchance they
lend the aid of their name and influence, as well as of their purses,
to promote the object in view. These facts, unpalatable as they
are, and obviously inconsistent with the due discharge of those
duties which are incumbent on every man as a citizen and a
friend of the poor and oppressed, cannot be contradicted, and it
is only when figures are brought forward that the real extent of
the evil is ascertained. Leaving the question of local taxation
then, we propose in the present paper to set forth, in outline at
least, the number, character, income, and expenditure of the chief
iustitutions for which appeals are constantly being made, and we
stall then endeavour to show, as far as possible, what appears to
us to be the most practicable means of reducing the number of
useless societies and of securing a better result for money laid out
in all cases.
In taking this survey we shall, of course, confine our
remarks to those charities which have their centre, if not their
immediate field of operation, in the metropolis, leaving still un-
touched that vast cluster of benevolent institutions to be found in
erery town and village in the kingdom.
And first, looking at the hospitals, and what may be termed
the purely medical charities of London, we find ourselves almost
startled by their number and importance. The “doctor,” to use
the familiar term bestowed upon the medical profession, as if the
title were their property by prescriptive right, has always been
regarded as the " poor man's friend,” and it is a pleasant fact
that no charities are more heartily supported, more thoroughly
satisfactory in their working, or more beneficial to the masses
of our population than those in which physicians and surgeons
are the active agents. The hospitals of London naturally divide
themselves into two classes, those for the treatment of general
cases, and those for the reception of patients suffering from
special maladies, deformities, or accidents. To these may be :
allded a supplementary list of dispensaries which serve to supply
the immediate wants of the poor in various localities, and have
increasel very largely in number of late years. The following

foundation was established on the site of an ancient priory, and
it is interesting to notice that the modern institution strictly
fulfils in spirit the intention of the old founder Rahere, who
devoted his substance to "the continued relief and help of an
hundred sore and diseased.” The institution was re-established
in 1547, when its managers obtained a Royal Charter, and from
that day to this it has nobly fulfilled its mission as a hospital
and medical school, serving not only to relieve the immediate
sufferings of those brought to its gates, but—and this is an
equally useful function of the modern system-has offered effec-
tive means for the future prevention of illness by advancing the
science of pathology, and providing a school of practice for the
student. The hospital contains 676 beds, 400 for surgical cases,
26 for patients suffering from ophthalmic diseases, and 250 for
Each ward is under the care of a “sister," with nume-
rous nurses, forming in all a body of about 120 assistants to the
medical officers. It will give an adequate idea of the relief
afforded when we state that on an average 6,000 patients are
admitted in the course of every year, being more than 16:4 per
day, while 100,000 medical and surgical out-patients or 273.9
per day are relieved, including those brought as cases of acci-
dent. In many instances they are supplied with money and
necessaries on leaving the hospital. The average income is
40,0001., chiefly derived from funded property. St. Thomas's
Hospital, the new buildings for which have recently been opened
on the Thames Embankment, was founded only six years after
the re-establishment of St. Bartholomew's. It now contains more
than 600 beds, but the number of in-patients has hitherto not
amounted to more than one-third of those at the former institution,
although the income
appears
to
average
about the same.
Passing over a century and a half we come to the period when
the Westminster Hospital in the Broad Sanctuary was founded
in 1719. It is built on a far smaller scale than the first named
institution and is only capable of accommodating 191 patients.
The average number under treatment is 146. Last year 26,657
patients or 73 per day were relieved, but of these only 1,756 or
4:8 per day were in-patients. The expenditure for the year was
7,3811. A special and very valuable feature at this hospital is the
fund for relieving patients who are discharged owing to their
being found incurable and therefore no longer fit objects for
treatment, although their need of assistance is intensified by the
fact that their ills can only be alleviated and never wholly re-
medied. It is indeed one of the most melancholy duties which
the hospital surgeon is called upon to perform, when he is com-
pelled discharge an incurable patient, and it would be well if
a similar fund to that existing at Westminster could be attached to
all like institutions. Guy's Hospital, the only one directly named
after its founder, was established in 1721, by Thomas Guy, Esq.
From its position in the Borough, it is naturally the great resort
of the poor on the south banks of the Thames. It accommodates
OD an average 510 inmates, the total number of in-patients in

the year being about 5,000 or 13.7 per day, and of out-patients
70,000 or 191•7 per day. The annual income is 40,0001. of which
about 30,0001. is available for hospital purposes. At St. George's
Hospital which provides for the extreme west of the metropolis
in the neighbourhood of Hyde Park, there is accommodation for
350 in-patients. At the London Hospital, situated at the other
end of the great city in the Whitechapel Road, there are 590
beds, 190 being wisely appropriated for cases of accident, which
in the midst of a large working population, are, it is needless to
say, of very frequent occurrence. The number of in-patients in
1870 was 5,213 or 14-2 per day, and of out-patients 63,736 or
174:6 per day. The ordinary expenditure for the year was
33,3421. From their central position, Charing Cross and King's
College Hospitals are the most important of the remaining in-
stitutions, and the fact that the reliable income of the latter only
amounts to one-third of its expenditure gives it a special claim
on the public as its management both medically and financially
is unexceptionable. Each of the other hospitals on our list
fulfils the same good work in its own immediate district, and
of all it may be said that the funds at the disposal of the autho-
rities might be increased with advantage. In such cases donors
need not hesitate as to the appropriation of their gifts, for the
applications made to the governors for orders for admission so
far exceed their powers of supply that no doubt can be enter-
tained as to the actual need of each separate establishment.
Under the head of hospitals, infirmaries, and surgical societies
for special objects, we find upwards of 90 distinct organisations.
Of these 10 are for children, 9 are lying-in-hospitals, 6 for chest
diseases, 5 for diseases of the eye, 5 for skin diseases, 5 for con-
sumptive patients, 3 for epilepsy and paralysis, 3 for diseases of
the feet, and the remainder for single diseases. In the miscel-
laneous class we find hospitals for accidents, cancer, cripples,
diseases of the teeth, diseases of the ear, fever, fistula, diseases of
the heart diseases of the legs, rupture, small-pox, spinal diseases,
stone, diseases of the throat. Then, there are hospitals for
classes of persons as well as of diseases, such as the Soldiers'
Hospital at Woolwich, named after Lord Herbert, and the Jewish
hospitals. The Homoeopathists, and the Mesmerists have esta-
blishments conducted on their own systems, while there is also a
galvanic institution. The hospitals for children are specially
worthy of commendation, and we are glad to see that their
number is being multiplied year by year. One of the last
established is the Evelina Hospital, in the Southwark Bridge
Road, founded in 1869 by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, in
memory of his wife, after whom it is named. It contains accom-
modation for 300 beds. Dispensaries for the supply of medicines,
and in some cases for the treatment of the sick poor at their own
homes, have sprung up in every quarter of the metropolis and
its suburbs. The majority of these admirable institutions are
supported by voluntary contributions, but occasionally the patients
are required to pay a small sum for the privilege of medical

treatment and medicines, and in one or two instances they have
been made self-supporting, somewhat after the manner of a
benefit society, except that medical treatment is the only object
for which the members make their payments. There are about
50 dispensaries in London and the suburbs, the benefits being
strictly confined to residents.
In connection with the whole question of medical charities
a report has just been issued by a committee of the Charity
Organisation Society, in which the opinion is expressed that the
present admission of cases as out-patients at the hospitals is too
indiscriminate, and is calculated to exercise a pauperizing, in-
iluence upon the working classes. The remedy proposed is to
establish provident dispensaries in the various districts of the
metropolis, and as far as possible throughout the kingdom, at
which the medicines and advice now given on the out-patient
system would be administered at a low tariff of charges, thus
tending to encourage independence and self-reliance among the
members. This is, undoubtedly, a wise proposition, but we
question whether the committee is not inclined to overstrain its
principle to some extent, and its belief that “many of the
54,175 out-patients relieved in 1870 were well able to defray the
charges of a local practitioner," and that " a still larger number
were quite in a position to pay the Cs. or 88. a-year required for
securing advice and medicine when ill,” is, we believe scarcely
capable of support from actual experience. Unquestionably
there is always a danger of creating habits of improvidence
among the people by furnishing them too freely with medical
treatment at the expense of others; but, any one who has watched
the gathering of poor creatures with out-patients' orders at the
gates of one of our London hospitals, or who is acquainted with
the ordeal through which they have to pass, and the length of
time they have to wait before they can receive attention, will
scarcely give implicit credit to the assertion that they are as a
rule capable of paying for advice at their own homes. Added
to this it must be reinembered that the women and children who
constitute a large proportion of the patients are frequently the
victims of the vice of their husbands and fathers, and that if it
were not for the kindly aid of a clergyman, or some other friend,
who bestows the hospital order, they would be left altogether
without assistance. It must not be forgotten, too, that the
advice received at the hospital is to the poor what the consulting
pohysician's opinion is to the rich, and thus even those who would
in ordinary cases trust to the local medical man, or to the chemist,
make an effort to obtain the higher authority. This is a natural
result of the popular faith in the excellence of the treatment
afforded at these great medical schools, where all the latest im-
provenients and the most recent discoveries are acted upon long
before they reach the parochial surgeon, and while, therefore, we
strongly commend the principle advocated above, we should be
sorry to see any strict rule laid down wirich might prevent cases
of real necessity from obtaining relief. If, for instance, the

committee could obtain general co-operation from the clergy,
and other unpaid almoners, and were in a position to give
its agents power to decide as to the fitness of persons for
hospital treatment either as out- or in-patients, it is impossible
not to see that any such test as the income of the head of the
family would be a very fallacious one, for in many instances the
children who needed relief would be deprived of it by such a
rule. At the same time, we cordially agree with the theory pro-
pounded, and we believe it would be an immense step in advance
if medical men in our poorer neighbourhoods were to adopt some
regular and graduated scale of charges, in order that the artisan
might not fear to “call the doctor” owing to his doubts as to
the ultimate cost of the proceeding: When the Peor Law Dis-
pensaries which are now being established are in thorough work-
ing order, one of the most prominent faults in our present system
will have been remedied, and if Provident Dispensaries or
Medical Benefit Societies—for that is what they really are—can
be formed as supplementary institutions much good will have
been effected. Care must be taken however, not to close any of
the channels at present open to the poor, until they have learnt
to provide for themselves, and the over anxiety to systematize
and organize must not be allowed to stand in the way of the
really useful work which is being done even if at times the
worthless as well as the deserving reap the benefit.
The plan propounded by the Committee above referred to for
promoting the spirit of self-reliance on which they lay so much
stress is, in effect, to bring to bear upon the question of medical
treatment, the co-operative system which has been adopted with
so much success in other matters. The object of a Provident
Dispensary as stated by them, should be “to enable such persons
in the district as cannot pay for medical attendance at the usual
charges, but are not in the receipt of Poor Law relief, to secure
for themselves and their families the advantage of medical
attendance, advice, and medicine during illness.” They further
recommend that applicants should be called upon to prove to the
satisfaction of the committee of management that they are un-
able to pay for assistance at the usual charges, and the following
scale is suggested for adoption :
Country
rer month.
A. Adults over 18
60. 4d.
B. Young persons (14 to 18) 4d. 4d.
C. Man and wife
10d. 8d.
D. Children under 14
2d. 2d.
Not more than four children under 14 shall be charged for in
any one family.
This is all feasible enough. The difficulty will of course
consist in inducing people to submit to the test of the Com-
mittee as to their being fit objects for membership, but as this
is the keystone of the scheme, it would be absurd to propose
any deviation from the rule, although in many dispensaries

already at work, the fact of persons making application for
admission is deemed a sufficient qualification, the presumption
being that they would not come in formâ pauperis unless
they were compelled to do so, a theory which has also been
adopted in the distribution of out-patients' orders for the
hospitals. Whether the Report meets with general approval
or not, there can be no doubt that more care is needed on the
part of governors and others who exercise the patronage of the
free institutions, as to their choice of the recipients of relief, and if
it is a fact, as stated by Dr. Stallard, at a conference of Poor Law
Medical Officers recently held, that “persons obtain medicines
at hospitals and sell them at the doors, there being a regular
trade in cod-liver oil, pills, and other medicines thus obtained,”
there is prima facie evidence for complete investigation.
Closely connected with our hospitals and dispensaries, and
indeed inseparable from them, if their work is to be properly
carried on and completed, are the convalescent institutions which
form one of the latest and most valuable fruits of modern philan-
thropic effort. When the hospital surgeon or physician has
effected his cure, the patient is but too apt to relapse, through
weakness and lack of proper nourishment, or from the want of
that best of all of nature's tonics, “ change of air,” and then it is
that the Convalescent Home steps in and carries him off to the
sea-side or the country for two or three weeks. The population
of the ten metropolitan Parliamentary boroughs, according to the
census of 1871, is 3,008,101, and the number of inhabited houses,
380,295, giving a proportion of nearly 8 persons to each house ;
but even admitting the accuracy of the latter figures, which,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining trustworthy information, are
scarcely reliable, the average of 8 people to a house conveys a
very faint idea of the frightful condition of over-crowding pre-
vailing in the metropolis, which renders convalescence from a
serious illness so tedious among the poor and hard-working. Even
according to the census tables the average in densely inhabited
districts, such as Whitechapel, St. Giles's, Holborn, Clerkenwell,
and St. Luke's, is much larger, varying from 10 to 11 per house;
and when it is remembered that these figures include the rich as
well as the poor, the houses with one or two inhabitants, as well
as those with 20 or 30, it will be obvious that such tables afford
very little idea of the actual state of the case. A visit to St.
George's in the East, however, or to Bethnal Green, will readily
convince any one as to the ordinary condition of the homes
of the mass of the people, and when to the impure atmosphere,
the insufficient water supply, and bad drainage, we add the
normal state of noise and disturbance prevailing in such localities
as Ratcliffe.Highway or Seven Dials, no further evidence will be
needed as to the utility or necessity of these institutions. With-
out their aid, indeed, perfect recovery would never be attained in
the case of patients suffering from eruptive fevers and other
diseases, the results of which are often more serious and more
difficult to eradicate than the actual illness with the first attack.

Again, at times when cholera and small-pox are epidemic, the
need for such institutions is specially felt, and many of those in
existence owe their origin to what was at the time regarded as
an ephemeral evil. When once used, however, their value be-
came too apparent to allow them to be discontinued, and thus the
system now forms a distinct branch of the metropolitan charities.
The sea side is naturally chosen as a favourite spot for such
homes; but others, and among them the Metropolitan Con-
valescent Institution, which was, we believe, the first of its class
are established in country villages. In Low's Handbook for the
year 1857, only two convalescent homes were included, but in
the last edition the number had increased to 20, and others
have since been established. This is enough to prove that the
demand is increasing in proportion to the supply,
For confirmed invalids there are but few homes, and the
majority of those at present open are for persons in the middle
and higher ranks of society, some of them also being compara-
tively self-supporting. For Incurables there are five institutions,
of which the most important are the Royal Hospital, at Putney
Heath, and the British Home, at Clapham Rise. The first of
these, founded in 1850, contains 137 inmates, and gives a pension
of 207. to 277 others. The inmates are drawn from people above
the pauperclass, and chiefly
consist of cases discharged from ordinary
hospitals. The British Home, established in 1861 at a meeting
held at the Mansion House, works on the same system, affording
accommodation to about 80 inmates, and giving pensions in 147
In order to provide another institution of the same cha-
racter, the want of which is every day being more and more felt
by the medical officers of the general hospitals, funds are now
being raised, and a public meeting was held last year, when,
under the title of the National Hospital for Incurables, its claims
on support were advocated by the Duke of Northumberland, the
Marquis of Salisbury, Mr. Gathorne Hardy, and other well-
known men.
The proposition to establish it in Oxfordshire
seems likely to commend itself to the public, inasmuch as the
distance from town will be immaterial, the journey having only,
as a rule, to be made once in the patient's life, while the land
will be considerably cheaper. Another wise resolution is that
which will place the orders for admission in the hands of a
medical board. Private benevolence has provided a home of a
similar character for ladies at Mount Greville, Kilburn ; and
.
women are also specially cared for at one of the institutions
superintended by Miss Twining, in Great Ormond Street. At a
time when money is lavishly spent on societies which altogether
lack any just cause of existence, the work of these institutions
deserves attention, for there can be no two opinions as to the
necessity existing for them and the utter inadequacy of the
present number.
The last class of charities which comes under the medical
division is that for the provision and training of nurses, a very
necessary link in the chain. The art of nursing is in itself a
cases.

nurses.
modern study in so far as it relates to the tender care of the
inmates of our hospitals and infirmaries, and the honour of
drawing the attention of the people of England to this most
womanly of all woman's work is due to Miss Florence Nightin-
gale, whose exertions in the Crimean war will never be forgotten,
It was in fact owing to her refusal to accept a testimonial which
was subscribed for by the public in recognition of her self-
denying and heroic labours by the soldiers' bedsides, that a very
important scheme for the training of nurses was set on foot. The
sum of about 50,0001. having been collected, Miss Nightingale
declined to receive it under any other conditions than that it
should be placed in the hands of trustees for the training of
A council was formed for its direction, and she only
reserved to herself the right to give advice. The training school
has been established at St. Thomas's Hospital, where twenty-two
or twenty-three probationers are maintained and instructed. At
present they are all required to serve in public hospitals and
infirmaries. Several similar funds exist in connection with the
Church of England, varying to some extent in their regulations
as to the dress of the “ sisters," as they are now generally termed,
but all conducted on the same broad principles. One of the
oldest of the institutions is that of the Nursing Sisters in
Devonshire Square, Bishopsgate, founded in 1840. Nearly 100
sisters are constantly employed in connection with it, besides
several probationers. They are allowed an annual stipend of
from 25l. to 301., are supplied with an appropriate dress, and are
maintained in the Home when they are unoccupied. Pensions
of 201. are also awarded to them after twelve years' work if
they find their strength failing. More distinctly ecclesiastical
in its arrangements is the London Diocesan Deaconess Institution
established in 1861, which definitely aims at the revival of the
female diaconate in the Church, and does not strictly confine its
work to nursing, although that is its main object. At this insti-
tution there are several sick wards, where cases requiring long
and careful treatment are received. The nurses, the majority
of whom are ladies by social position, undertake work in the
country when their services are called for by the clergy or by
hospital authorities. Their labours in this important particular
have largely aided in the removal of the old prejudices against the
employment of members of sisterhoods in hospitals and workhouses,
which are gradually dying away, and although the number of ladies
willing to devote themselves to such arduous, and in many cases
absolutely repulsive duties is never likely to be large enough to
supersede the services of women of the lower ranks, even if it
were desirable to do so, the benefits thus conferred on the suffer-
ing poor have been incalculable.
Having thus far considered the charities which provide for
cases of actual illness or accident, we will now proceed to notice
a still more numerous class of institutions, the foundation of
some of which carries us back far into the past, and which may
be described generally as—

From this table, to which we have added the dates of the
various foundations, as far as we have been able to ascertain
them, it will be seen that the good old custom of providing
lic mes for the aged has almost entirely fallen into desuetude at
the present day. With the exception of a few trade asylums,

t the
and one or two homes for widows of soldiers, there is not a single
institution of recent foundation in the above list, and the majority
of them were in existence before the year 1800. This is to be
regretted, for although in some few cases, funds have been
diverted from the purposes for which they were intended, and
have been transferred to persons who have no claim upon
them, there is no form of charity which, when properly ad-
ministered, is more really beneficial. Every almshouse or asylum
of this nature is in effect a means of escape from the work-
house for a certain number of the infirm and worn out, and
although theoretically the proper place for those who, owing
to misfortune, are unable to earn their living, is unquestionably
the establishment provided by the parish, it is impossible not
to sympathise with the disinclination which is felt by persons
who “have seen better days,” to enter such a place. The Eng.
lish workhouse has acquired a very unenviable notoriety, and
those who in reality are least deserving of aid too often enjoy
the greatest comfort within its walls. Whether under a happier
state of Poor Law administration this antipathy to
house” might not be removed, is another question, but even
under the most satisfactory auspices a large portion of the popu-
lation will always, through no fault of their own, become in their
declining years fit objects for admission to such Institutions as
those named above. The City Companies' Almshouses form,
perhaps, one of the best illustrations of the truth of our state-
ment, as in every case they are filled by persons whose claims
are beyond all question, and who have been reduced to want
through sheer incapacity for work. The hard-headed economist
may of course argue that persons who have not provided against
the rainy day ought to be content with workhouse fare, but
happily our forefathers took a different view of the matter, and
hence we are still able to provide for many of the sufferers. A
reference to the above list will show that there is scarcely a
single trade or profession which has not thus some refuge for its
poorer members while nearly every district in and around
London has its institution for aged residents. The mismanage-
ment which has taken place in certain instances can scarcely be
denied, but that is only an argument against the working of
the system and not against the system itself.
The case of St. Katherine's Hospital which has recently occu-
pied the attention of Parliament is a notable instance of the
manner in which the funds given for a special locality have
been diverted to the benefit of individuals who can scarcely be
said to be fitting recipients of the bequest. The Hospital, en-
dowed in 1145, and thus forming the oldest foundation of the kind
in London, originally stood on the site of St. Katherine's docks.
Its removal largely increased the revenues owing to the compensa-
tion given by the Company to the master and brethren, but no
one who studies the history of the institution can doubt that the
only logical manner of fulfilling the spirit of the will of the
Royal foundress would be to devote the funds to the benefit of

the population of the district where the building originally stood.
In former days, as a writer in the Globe recently pointed out, the
master and three brothers—all priests—assisted by three sisters
of charity, devoted themselves to the surrounding poor. Twenty,
four mendicants were daily relieved at the gates. One thousand
poor received yearly the alms of the hospital, and poor scholars
were educated and maintained within its walls. For hundreds
of years the institution thus fulfilled the intentions of its
founder. But on the dawn of the Reformation the charity was
secularised, and gradually from that date it lost its original
character, and became at last not so much an hospital for the
relief of the poor and needy as a retreat for pensioners who were:
thought worthy of Royal bounty. In 1681 it began again to
assume its original character, and clerical brothers re-appeared,
but it never recovered its former efficiency. When St. Kathe-
rine's Docks were made, the hospital was removed to its present
position in the Regent's Park. Thus transplanted from a thickly-
populated district to one where, comparatively speaking, there is
no scope for a charitable institution of this kind at all, the
revenues of the hospital have been, to a great extent, wasted..
The property brings in at the present moment upwards of 7,0001.
a-year, and the income in a few years will be doubled. Out of
this revenue the master has been receiving 2,0001. a-year, three
brothers have been receiving 3001. a-year each, and three sisters:
2001. a-year each. It should be stated that besides this allow-
ance, each brother and sister has a separate house and sundry
emoluments. There is also a chaplain attached to the hospital,
who receives 1001. a-year. The office of the master for years.
past has been a sinecure. The brothers and sisters reside four
months in the year. Two of the former have large livings in the
country ; one is chaplain at Dieppe. There have been some
pensioners attached to the hospital and a school, but out of the
whole revenue of 7,0001. a-year only about 1,2001. has been spent
on actual charity ; the rest has gone to defray the emoluments
of the officers and the expenses of the estate. This being a plain
statement of facts, no one, we think can deny that the agitation
for reform is well founded, and we trust it will succeed.
Some of the institutions owe their origin to curious causes, and
among others it may be noted that the Institution of the London
Almshouses at Brixton was founded from a bequest given to pro-
vide an illumination to commemorate Reform in Parliament, a very
satisfactory appropriation of the property. The Licensed Victuai-
lers' Asylum was the result of the efforts of a few members of the
trade to establish the Morning Advertiser as their organ, the
profits being set apart for the benefit of their distressed brethren.
Even parish clerks, a profession now almost out of date, except
in those places where the venerable functionary is irremovable
owing to some ancient statute, have their Asylum, but it is, we
believe, intended only for the use of persons who have regularly
subscribed to its funds, and is thus rather a provident institution
than an almshouse."

present a striking illustration of the thriftiness and provident

resident in special districts. Thus, the Herefordshire, Westmor-
land, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire Societies, are of great assistance
to the natives of their respective counties. There are also several
pension funds for foreigners, arranged according to their nationality
and managed as a rule by their own countrymen. If to these were
added the vast number of benefit societies, registered under the
Friendly Societies Act, the building societies which are all
worked on the same mutual investment principle, and lastly the
insurance clubs and savings banks managed by the Govern-

ment and by public companies, we should arrive at a con-
clusion which would be highly creditable to the laborious bread-
winners among our town populations, who it must not be
forgotten have in these days of high rents, increased prices ei
provisions, and heavy local taxation, a by no means easy task to
supply the present wants of their families, irrespective o
making a suitable provision for the future. These charities,
then, form one of the most pleasant branches of our subject, in
fact they ought scarcely to be included in the category at all
, for
although they are partially indebted to the donations of the
heads of the various firms, their strength lies in the co-operation
of the individual members.
While the trades and peaceful professions of the home-staying
portion of the population are thus well provided for, the country
has itself undertaken to relieve the wants of our sailors anil
soldiers, their widows and orphans, and a series of funds have
been established with this object, which may conveniently be
termed
PATRIOTIC FUNDS.
The principle on which subscriptions have been raised to meet
emergencies caused by the wars in which England has been
engaged is unquestionably sound, inasmuch as it is only right
and just that the families of our national defenders who fall in
the exercise of their duty should be provided for, and that
those who are seriously injured should be saved from the neces-
sity of going to the workhouse on their return home ; but it is
open to doubt whether the present system of Government
pensions and gratuities is calculated on a fair basis, and whether if
it were more liberal the need for extraneous assistance would not
be removed. In order to give some idea of the extent of these
funds, a full summary of their receipts and expenditure from the
year 1800, was recently contributed to the Pall llall Gazette by
the writer of the present paper, from which some of the following
facts and figures are quoted :-
The earliest of the funds still in operation is that known as
“Lloyd's Patriotic Fund," which was formed on the 20th of July,
1803, at a meeting in the City, chiefly attended by the under-
writers and others engaged at “Lloyds,” who voted 20,0001. out
of their funded property, in addition to their private contribu-
tions, towards the relief of the sufferers in and from military and
naval actions. This amount was speedily increased by subscrip-
tions from all parts of the kingdom, and up to March, 1870), the
receipts, including interest and profit on sale of stock, amounted
to 820,8181. 6s. 10d. A considerable balance remains, and is
being dispensed in pensions to the relatives of men killed during
the wars in Russia, China, and New Zealand, the sufferers from
the Indian mutiny not being admitted to the benefits of the
.fund.
The “ Central Association in Aid of the Wives and Families
of Soldiers on Active Service” is the second fund claiming our

notice, and this seems to have been managed in such a manner
that, after fulfilling its objects by maintaining the families of
men during their absence in the Crimea, and providing for many
of their widows and orphans, its funds, amounting to 123,5291.,
were nearly exhausted. The balance was devoted to the endow-
ment of a Soldiers' Infant Home at Hampstead.
With the third fund on our list, generally known as the
Patriotic Fund, which is managed by a Royal Commission, the
case is totally different. Its main object was to provide for the
relief of the widows and orphans of the soldiers, sailors, or
marines who were killed or died on active service during the war
with Russia, and so large were the subscriptions that in 1854
upwards of a million sterling had been paid to the account of the
Commissioners at the Bank of England. It soon became evident
that after making a most liberal provision for the wants of all
who had any claim upon the fund according to the original design
of its founders, a considerable balance would remain, and the
Commissioners themselves declared that “the claims fell con-
siderably short of the number they estimated for.” That this has
proved correct is shown by the fact that the committee are now
preparing to grant pensions for the relief of sufferers by other
From the statements appended to the first report of the
supplementary commission appointed on the 26th of March, 1868,
it appears that the total sum received up to the last day of that
year was 1,460,7181. 68. 2d. ; that the capital then remaining was
509,340l., producing annually 22,3701., in addition to which
32,4781. is derived from annuities, thus making the present gross
income 54,8481. The actuary reports that, after setting aside
one-tenth for the liabilities as a reserve to meet contingencies,
there will be an available surplus of 108,3001. We find, however,
no balance sheets by which the annual expenditure can be
checked, the accounts not having been audited since 1866. The
delay in their preparation is said to have arisen“ from exceptional
circumstances which are not likely to occur again.”
Passing on to consider the Victoria Asylum at Wandsworth,
which was established for the maintenance and education of 300
orphan daughters of soldiers and sailors, we learn that for the
purchase of the land and the building and its endowment
218,073l. was appropriated from the original fund ; but even this
large amount has failed to keep the institution free from debt,
owing, we are told, to the size of the asylum and its peculiar
construction and arrangements, which render it most expensive
to manage. The rates and taxes alone amount to 6001. a year.
This being the case, and bearing in mind that not more than 260
instead of the 300 children for whom provision was made have been
admitted, there is fair ground for questioning the wisdom of the
system adopted, more especially as it is stated that the lady
superintendent has been superseded' on account of her inability
to account for certain sums of money.
A farm and garden con-
sisting of about fifty acres are attached to the asylum, on which
a bailiff is at work with a staff of labourers, but on this also there

is a deficiency, whereas the professional opinion of Mr. Sanderson
on the system pursued in its management is that it ought to be
most profitable, and that after supplying the asylum with produce
at wholesale prices there ought to be a considerable margin to
the credit of the commission. We should be curious to see a
statement of the average annual cost of each child from the
foundation of the institution down to the present day, showing
the relative saving or the reverse in each year, and, unless we
are much mistaken, the addition of such a comparative table to the
report would astonish even the Commissioners, if it were placed
side by side with the results of the system pursued at our orphan
asylums.
In regard to the official staff of the commission it is
again difficult to form a clear opinion without the aid of the
balance-sheets, the absence of which is a great drawback.
It appears, however, that from 1854 to 1868 the establish-
ment consisted of ten persons, with Captain (now Admiral)
E. G. Fishbourne and W. H. Mugford, paymaster, both of whom
had been formerly naval officers, at their head. On the retire-
ment of Admiral Fishbourne he received out of the funds of the
commission an annual pension of 3001., after thirteen and a
quarter years' service as "honorary' secretary with 6001. a year.
This, remembering the source from which the funds were de-
rived, seems a curious proceeding more especially as the reduc-
tion of the staff caused by his retirement and the discharge of
another clerk is subsequently quoted by the Commissioners as
bringing about a saving of 400l., while if the pension of 3001. is
deducted the saving is reduced to 100l. At the same time we
fail to understand the system on which the pension was calculated.
If Admiral Fishbourne had served thirteen years under Govern-
ment as a clerk, he would even on reduction of office' have
received only eighteen-sixtieths of his pay at the time of leaving,
which at the full salary of 6001, would have given him 1801., bat
as he left apparently from choice he would only have been entitled
to thirteen sixtieths, or 1301. The pension was of course sanc-
tioned by the Commissioners and the Queen ; but it is difficult
to ascertain any just grounds for granting it out of funds given by
public charity, as the recipient had already been well paid for the
services he had rendered. The outlay in official salaries for 1868
was 2,041l., which largely exceeds that of the Indian Mutiny
Fund, reported in ‘Low's Handbook to the Charities of London,
as amounting to 500l., or of the Peabody Fund, stated to be 2936
.
The cases are not, indeed, absolutely similar, but as the Com-
missioners state that the data upon which they grant pensions
are supplied by the Admiralty and War Offices, and are reported
on by the Executive Committee and not by the clerks, it follows
that the work of the latter must be of a mere routine character,
and for this the establishment seems to be somewhat costly.
The Indian Mutiny Fund alluded to above is the last which
we shall notice, and of this the accounts are so clear and so well
posted up that there is no difficulty in obtaining explicit informa-

tion. From the balance-sheet for the year ending the 31st
of December last we learn that the total sum raised was
440,2001. 188. 6d., of which 250,000l. was disbursed during the
war and subsequently among the immediate sufferers; the
balance, now standing at 155,261!. 188. 6d., being funded for the
payment of annuities. The proceedings are under the manage-
ment of officers appointed by the original promoters with
Alderman Finnis as president.
Within the pa year, however, a large addition to the number
of patriotic funds has been made, although happily not owing to
the wants of our own soldiers and sailors. The lengthened struggle
between France and Germany called forth an amount of sympathy
in this country which has seldom been equalled, and the belli-
gerents on either side reaped the benefit of English liberality,
without which their losses by famine and disease would
have been scarcely less awful than those on the battle field.
At the same time our national kindliness as usual led us
too far, and more money was collected than was absolutely
required, while many home charities were severely crippled in
consequence. There were in all about twenty organisations in-
volving a good deal of needless expense in the duplication of
labour, and some of the Committees seem to have traversed
almost the same ground as their fellow-workers.
The most prominent among the societies for the special benefit
of the French was the “ Société de Secours aux Blessés Mili-
taires," with its central office at the Palais de l'Industrie at Paris
-M. le Comte de Flavigny as its president, Mdme. la Maréchale
Canrobert as its vice-president, and Messrs. Piesse and Lubin as
its London representatives. Secondly, the “Souscription Fran-
çaise en Angleterre,” with a London Committee headed by
Messrs. Ch. Devaux and Co., of 62, King William Street.
Thirdly, the “Société Française d’Angleterre pour les Blessés
Français," with its central office at 13, Rue du Helder, Paris, and
a London Committee, of which M. Léon Clerc was chairman,
dating from 5, Red Lion Square. The fourth fund was raised in
connection with the “French Protestant Evangelical Committee
in Paris,” the Rev. J. du Pontet de la Harpe, a Clergyman of the
French Protestant Church in London, being the local Secretary,
and Mr. A von Glehn, of Mincing Lane, the Treasurer. A fifth
subscription was collected by the “ French National Committee,”
of 9, Old Compton Street, Soho, in order to assist Frenchmen
to return to their country to defend it, to enable their families to
return to their native homes, and to aid their wives and children
when left in England. Of this organisation, M. Marc Ratazzi
was the leader. Sixthly, the “Colonial and Continental Church
Society," a body which provides English Clergymen for conti-
nental chaplaincies, obtained aid in money and material which
were dispensed mainly by its agents at Dusseldorf and elsewhere.
The seventh fund, and the most important of those for the
Prussian soldiers, was the “German Association in aid of the
Wounded and Destitute," with Baron Schröder as its Chairman.

The eighth fund was the “ Hülfsverein für verwundete Krieger,"
at 30, Štainton Terrace, St. Pancras, chiefly, of course, supported
by Germans. The ninth, the “ Victoria Stiftung," established by
the Crown Princess of Prussia, to provide for the wives and
children of the absent German soldiers, of which Mrs. Salis
Schwabe was the English representative. Tenthly, there was an
* Exhibition of Pictures for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of
German Soldiers," to which a fund was attached with Mr. T. J.
Gullick as Honorary Secretary. The eleventh organisation was a
“ Ladies Committee for the Relief of the Widows and Orphans
of the Soldiers of both Armies," of which Mrs. Russell Gurney
and Mrs. Salis Schwabe were the Treasurers. The “Frencil
Refugees' Fund,” for the aid of young women of respectable
French families who reached London from Paris friendless and
destitute, made the twelfth fund having been established by the
Marchioness of Lothian and other ladies. Of the same nature,
although more immediately calling for the support of English-
men, was the “ British Charitable Fund in Paris," its main pur-
pose being the relief of English ladies and others who were de-
prived of their means of livelihood by the sad events in Paris
and the neighbourhood. Mrs. Thudichum's appeal for the “ Field
Hospital at Bingen," and a similar call for help from Dr. Laseron,
of the Cottage Hospital, Tottenham, who went to the field
of war with some nurses from his establishment, made the
fourteenth and fifteenth funds, while others, among which the
Daily News Fund for the Peasantry in the north-east of France,
and the French Peasant Farmers' Seed Fund must be mentioned,
were specially designed to help those who while not engaged in the
war, had lost their means of employment, owing to the devasta-
tion of the country and the destruction of property.
While, however, these miscellaneous funds are worthy of note,
the British National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in
War claims special attention at our hands. The report which is
a formidable volume of 185 pages copiously illustrated with
maps, presents a complete summary of the Society's operations.
From the balance-sheet we learn that the total receipts
amounted to considerably more than a quarter of a million,

disabled soldiers; that 28,9711. was devoted to the purchase of
clothing and bedding ; 8,0901. to the purchase of surgical in-
struments ; and 7,8661. for various medical stores, disinfectants,
&c. In addition to these amounts we find an entry of 2,111l. ex-
pended in buildings for hospitals and stores ; 21,7051. on the
transport service, including the purchase and hire of horses,
vehicles, and forage, stable expenses, repairs, the packing and
carriage of stores ; and 23,845l. on staff allowances and expenses
abroad, including the pay of surgeous, dressers, lay agents, in-
firmiers, drivers, grooms, porters, messengers, &c. The different
other and societies and ambulances, whose members by their
local knowledge proved the best almoners that the committee
could employ, were subsidized by the Red Cross Society to
the extent of 89,8981. To these amounts must be added
2,0861. for salaries and wages at the office in St. Martin's-
place; 8,6271. for office expenses, printing, stationery, postage,
telegrams, advertisements, &c.; and 3,0401. for such miscel-
laneous expenditure as the loss by exchange of sums into foreign
money, bankers' commissions and charges, insurance of stores,
gratuities to “officials on the Continent, and rent of head-
quarters in various places abroad.
How far the public will be satisfied to learn that the immense
sum of 73,2121. remains untouched is a matter of opinion. Its
investment to provide against future emergencies of a similar
nature has, we believe, been finally decided on, but the fact that
the balance exists suggests the reflection whether the committee,
to whom high praise is due for their benevolent labours, were
not acting wrongly in allowing appeals to be made and money
received to a large extent, while home charities were suffering;
while it is also worthy of thought whether it is wise_to sink
another immense sum which will, perhaps, like the Patriotic
Fund, eat up a large portion of its annual interest in the office
expenses and clerks' salaries. The public gave their money in
nine cases out of ten to meet an immediate want, not to form a
reserve fund for the future, and, although it might be a difficult
task to ascertain the subscribers' wishes, it would be satisfactory
to learn how far they agree with the proposed plan of disposing of
the balance. At any rate, the moral to be drawn from all these
cases is the same, and men who use every possible means of
obtaining subscriptions from persons who, under the impulse of
the moment, not unfrequently give more than they can afford,
incur a grave responsibility. With the example of the Patriotic
Fund before us, it is necessary to be cautious in all such matters.

INSTITUTIONS FOR CHILDREN.
Children, their wants, their crimes, and their education, have
always occupied a large share of the philanthropist's attention, and
a very considerable proportion of the Metropolitan charities are
designed for their relief, their reformation, or their moral and
physical training. There are upwards of forty orphanages and
asylums for fatherless children some few of which are open with-
out restriction, but the majority are for the children of men be-
longing to special trades, or professions. Among those most
recently formed, may be mentioned the Metropolitan Police
Orphanage, and the Stockwell Orphanage, conducted by Mr.
Spurgeon, of the Metropolitan Tabernacle. The Adult Orphan
Institution, founded in 1820, deserves special mention, as it pro-
vides for the daughters of clergymen and naval and military
officers at an age when they would be unable to remain in other
institutions, and trains them for work as governesses. Our
space will not permit us to give a detailed list of the homes,
refuges, ragged schools and reformatories which have been
established of late years ; suffice it to say that they are to
be found in every part of London, and that, as a rule,
they are admirably conducted. The great army of shoeblacks,
scavengers, and rag-collectors, gathered together by the Ragged
School Shoeblack Society, and its kindred associations, is a direct
evidence of what can be effected by earnest effort, at a compara-
tively small outlay, for the amelioration of the condition of those
who without such agencies would too often add to the already
heavy list of our criminal population. The system adopted by
the promoters of the society is as simple as it is thoroughly
satisfactory in its working, and serves not only to generate habits
of industry and forethought, but also relieves the boys from any
consciousness that they are dependent upon others. They are
required to give up the whole amount earned during the day,
which is applied as follows :—6d. is returned to the boy as his
allowance, and one-third of the remainder ; one-third is retained
by the society for expenses ; the balance is reserved as a bank
for the boy's benefit. The following is a list of the London shoe-
black societies, with the date of the establishment of each, the
number of boys employed, and the amount of their earnings
during the past year :-

Such a statement as this is highly satisfactory and creditable
to the boys and their patrons, giving an average of 271. 138., or
more than 108. per week as the earnings of each boy. The
young workers are chosen according to merit from the schools
conducted by the Ragged School Union so inseparably asso-
ciated with the name of Lord Shaftesbury, and it may be in-
teresting to state that the average attendance at the day schools
in 1870 was 22,883, and at the night schools 8,748. A visit to
one of the centres where the boys congregate after their days'
work can scarcely fail to prove instructive to persons who are
unacquainted with the manners and customs of our Street Arabs,
while the results attained furnish a very clear proof that the
truest philanthropy is that which teaches people how to help
thiemselves. Another large group of homes are those which
provide a night's lodging and food to applicants, actual want
being the only condition of admission. Such is the House of
Charity in Soho, an institution under the direct superintendence
of the clergy of the parish, but open to all wayfarers. The previous
histories of the unfortunate inmates furnish some touching
gimpses of the misery existing under the surface of society, for
many of the poor creatures who thus gladly accept accommoda-
tion have by slow but sure steps sunk down from comparative
atiluence to their present melancholy position, and professional
mca and their children are frequently found among them. It
is, of course, in the winter months that the houses are most
crowded, indeed during severe weather the provision is utterly
insufficient for the houseless and homeless wanderers. There
are upwards of 70 homes and reformatories in London. For

very young children the Crèche or infant nursery is now to be
found in several places, and at St. Alban’s, Holborn, Quebec Chapel,
and St. Andrew's, Wells Street, the little ones are gathered in and
cared for, while their mothers are at work. There is a similar
establishment in connection with the Roman church at 16, Beau-
mont Street, Marylebone.
CHARITY ORGANIZATION, AND THE REPRESSION OF MENDICITY.
The relief of distress at the homes of the people is a special
and from some points of view a more interesting form of
public benevolence than that which we have hitherto been
considering The distinction lies in the fact that in such
cases the voluntary worker is generally the almoner, while in
almost all institutions for the reception of the sick or suffer-
ing, the officials are necessarily paid. The Roman Church has
always included in its machinery a large body of sisters of
charity, who have tended the poor at their own homes, and
among English Churchmen and Nonconformists the same work
has been done in an admirable manner by district visitors and
other lay helpers. Of late years, however, several distinct
associations, pledging themselves to seek out the sick and afflicted
and to supply visitors in parishes where the ordinary residents
are unable to cope with the wants of the population have been
instituted, foremost among which stand the Metropolitan Visiting
and Relief Association, formed in 1843, and the Society for
the Relief of Distress, established in 1866. The funds in both
cases are distributed without any reference to creed, and every
subscription paid into the latter fund is devoted to the relief
of the poor, the management of the institution being under-
taken by honorary officials. A. glance at the report of the
Society shows that its last year's income of 3,1531. was dis-
tributed in equal proportions in each district of the Metropolis,
including those south of the Thames. While, however, the
relief of distress has furnished and always must furnish work
for all who are willing to serve under the Red Cross at home,
there can be little question that in many cases, notwithstanding
the care taken by the almoners and the supervision exercised by
the ministers of religion, imposition and fraud-are practised, and
the worthless and profligate in addition to those who are more
properly objects for parochial relief under the Poor Law,
obtain the aid which belongs to others. To organise charity then,
so as to prevent the same ground being worked by different
agencies and to repress mendicity, which not unfrequently
becomes a pleasant profession to the idle and the reprobate, is
as distinctly a duty as the relief of distress, and for this
purpose two very important associations are actively engaged.
The oldest of the two bodies the Society for the Suppression of
Mendicity, established in 1818, prosecutes impostors and relieves
cases of ascertained distress, but the impossibility of doing the
work that has to be done without a series of local organisations
induced some practical philanthropists to form another institution

a
on a more extended basis, which under the title of The Society
for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity, has
been at work since the year 1869. Its great object is to assist,
and, if needful, to compel the Poor Law Officer in every parish
to do his duty, and to form a medium through which cases of all
kinds of distress may be handed over to associations whose
province it is to relieve them. Its method of working cannot be
better described than by the following extract from Low's
Handbook :-“A Charity Office is intended to be established,
where practicable, near to each Poor Law Relieving Office
throughout the metropolis, under the management of the Com-
mittee of Charity of each parish or district; and a charity
agent will be appointed, who will be in direct communication
with the relieving officer, the local charities, the police, the
clergy and ministers, and the district visitors.
Every case,
on presentation of a ticket, will be carefully inquired into,
and referred to the appropriate channels of relief, or other-
wise properly dealt with. Confirmed beggars and vagrants will
be sent to the Poor Law guardians, or prosecuted before the
magistrate as circumstances demand. The charity agent will
thus be to his committee what the Poor Law relieving officer is
to the board of guardians, and will be specially charged to com-
pile and keep up such a register of cases relieved by the several
charities as devised by this Society, and recommended by the
Poor Law Minute of 20th November, 1869; the register to be
accessible to all persons interested in the efficient relief of the
poor, whether through legal or voluntary agencies. Local offices

a
trict agents do their work. They must be of a totally dif-
ferent type to the official of the Poor Law, who is regarded
with little short of horror by the poor, and such men, willing
to undertake the work, are hard to find. When, however, they
are found there seems little doubt that the plan will prove
successful, and that the charity police, as they may be termed, will
form a useful addition to our local and national machinery,
although at the same time it must be admitted that a large por-
tion of the work which at present devolves upon them ought to
be performed by the Poor Law officers, and paid for from local
rates, which if properly administered are more than sufficient to
provide for the wants of all who are really deserving of aid. The
real need of such a society was well explained by the Earl of
Derby at the conference held in March last at Willis's Rooms,
when he said :-“We, its promoters, believe that there is in
London both charity enough and wealth enough to put an end to
all undeserved distress if only we could get it applied in the right
place. But the difficulty is in that application. People are will-
ing enough to give--whatever may be our national faults par-
simony is not one of them—but they like to give in their own way;
they are not easily persuaded that their way is not the best, and so,
instead of the harmony which ought to exist when good men are
working for the same end, you have something like what is popularly
called a Dutch concert-everybody playing his own tuneon his own
instrument; or, if I may use a more dignified simile--charity in
I
London is apt to fall as rain falls in a tropical country, where no
expedients have been used to catch it and apply it for irrigating
purposes; at one season there is a drought, at another season a
deluge, and the excessive supply in the latter case is as mis-
chievous as the deficient supply in the former. I will not go into
figures which may be disputed, and with regard to which absolute
certainty is unattainable ; for my own part, I am convinced that
the majority of calculations which have been made rather under-
rate than overrate the amount which is given away in London in
the course of the year, but this much I will venture to affirm,
that fully enough is given effectually to supplement the action
of the Poor Law if you could only get it directed into the right
channel. But much of it is not so directed now, and thus it
happens that you have, on the one hand, those painful cases of
people-generally such as have known better days—dying of
actual starvation, while by their side you have, fat and flourishing,
and I am afraid, rather increasing than diminishing in numbers,
a tribe of rascally impostors who will do anything but work, and
who get what is in many cases a very comfortable living out of
the good nature and credulity, and sometimes out of the fears, of
the public.
Facts, as detailed in the reports prove the truth of his Lord-
ship’s assertions :-
In Clapham, last year, there were investigated 542 cases
of residents in the district. Of these 111 were judged to be
either impostors or undeserving, 139 were helped with loans

or gifts, as suited their requirements ; 292 appeared to be cases
suitable to be dealt with by the Poor Law, and were accordingly
recommended to the guardians. In Paddington, with a popula-
tion of 109,000 in the parish, there were 1,320 applicants whose
claims were gone into. Of these 268 were proved to be un-
deserving or not in want, 368 were helped with loans or gifts,
172 were referred either to the guardians or to special charities
intended to meet such cases as theirs, and 400, being non-resi-
dents, were referred to their own districts. In Marylebone the
applications were 1,897, of which 662 were assisted, 599 appeared
to be cases for parochial relief, 416 were condemned as un-
deserving, and 104 were found to have given false addresses.
Thus, the cases of imposture, or something like it, amounted in
Clapham to 20 per cent. on the applications, in Paddington to
20 per cent., and in Marylebone, if false addresses are taken to
be evidence of deception, which they almost necessarily are, to
upwards of 27 per cent.
Such figures as these prove emphatically the need which exists
for an association with ramifications in every district, and as at
its central oflice it provides information on almost every point
connected with metropolitan charity, its promoters are fairly
entitled to the thanks of the public for their energetic labours
which have already borne good fruit.
Into the remaining portion of this important subject our space
will not enable us to enter. The vast array of religious societies,
educational institutions, and book societies require separate con-
sideration, but the result of a careful survey of the whole can
scarcely fail to convince an unprejudiced person that in
numerous instances the work is done twice, and occasionally three
times. In more than one instance that could be pointed out,
societies exist without absolute benefit to any persons concerned
except the officials, and thus the sum expended on the machinery is
wasted, and might with advantage be transferred to societies doing
kindred work. In one notorious case, which has been more than
once publicly alluded to, a society formed for the distribution of
books and tracts has existed for two or three years and has
carried on what has virtually amounted to a publishing business
at an annual loss with no benefit to any one but the authors and
clerks. Such a proceeding is of course utterly without excuse,
but it is, we fear only one among several glaring examples which
could be brought forward, all tending to prove the necessity for
some public audit of accounts, and some method of preventing
the useless multiplication of organisations. When it is remem-
bered that the gross annual income of the charities cf London is
not less than three and a half millions sterling, and that at the
same time want, misery, and ignorance still exist to an extent
which alarms statesmen and philanthropists, we have abundant
cause for suggesting that reform is needful, and that the subject
is well worthy of investigation. How any satisfactory remedy
for the existing waste of money, and energy is to be applied, it
is difficult to say, but one very useful course would be to hold a

conference at which the working of every society should be
analysed, its office expenses as compared with its income care-
fully calculated, and the benefits conferred in return for the
annual outlay estimated. Recommendations based on the facts.
then collected might be embodied in a report, and if it were
signed by men in whom the public has confidence, it could
scarcely fail to exercise a salutary effect, even if it did not
furnish a basis for legislation. In addition to this an appeal
should be made to the committees of all those societies and
charities which are found to be superfluous or useless to suspend
their operations, and to invite their subscribers to lend their
aid to some other funds doing the same work. That strenuous.
opposition would be raised to such a course cannot be doubted,
but it would emanate chiefly from those whose personal in-
terests would be injured by the abolition of the societies and
would, therefore, be estimated at its true value. At any rate
the publication of a fair and and unbiased opinion on the sub-
ject would serve to check the formation of new societies, and
this in itself would be desirable. Pending the adoption of
any such course of action the subscribers to our metropolitan
charities must judge for themselves as to the propriety of
giving or withholding their support, but we would urge upon
them in all cases to remember that injudicious almsgiving is one
of the most serious evils at the present day ; and more especially
we would warn them against aiding in the promotion of new funds
which has become quite as much a trade as the formation of
bubble companies, only that in the former case, the secretary, who
is generally the prominent mover in the undertaking, seldom fails.
to make some capital out of his exertions, even if the avowed
object of the society is never realized. If public men would
sternly refuse to patronize such projects until they are con-
vinced of their utility, much good would be effected ; and we
trust that the increased attention devoted to the subject may
be accepted as a proof that the day of such abuses as we have
mentioned has nearly passed away. There is enough real
misery in the world without the creation of imaginary evils.
for the benefit of interested persons, and the sooner the public
realize this fact the better.
To enable the reader to form a fair judgment on the matter
the above survey of the existing state of the charities may be of
some service, and we recommend all who are inclined to study
the subject carefully to weigh the evidence in "Low's Hand-
book,” which is furnished by the secretaries, and may, therefore,
be relied upon.

ABSTRACTS OF IMPORTANT ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
PASSED IN THE THIRD SESSION OF THE TWENTIETII PARLIAMENT
OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND,
I. ARMY AND NAVY.
ARMY REGULATION.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 86.--August 17, 1871.]
An Act for the better Regulation of the Regular and Auxiliary Land
Forces of the Crown ; and for other Purposes relating thereto.
This Act has nineteen clauses, with a preamble reciting that it is
expedient to provide for the better regulation of the regular and
auxiliary land forces of the Crown, and referring to the abolition of
purchase by Royal Warrant. The details as to the compensation to
be allowed to oſlicers in respect of their commissions occupy the first
five clauses. The sixth clause recites that the jurisdiction of lieute-
nants of counties or of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in relation to
the militia, yeomanry, and volunteers is to revert to Her Majesty, and
to be exercised through her Secretary of State or any officers to whom
the power may be delegated, except that the appointment of deputy
lieutenants is still to rest with the lieutenants of counties and the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and that the lieutenants of counties are still to
exercise their functions in relation to the raising of the militia by
ballot. Commissions or first appointments to the rank of comet,
ensign, or lieutenant in the auxiliary forces are to be given to persons
recommended by the lieutenant of the county and approved by IIer
Majesty, if such recommendation is made within thirty days of the
declaration of the vacancy by the Secretary of State. Clause 7 pro-
vides that the number of the auxiliary forces shall be decided by Par-
liament from time to time. Clause 8 directs that men enlisted in the
militia shall attend for preliminary training on the direction of the
Secretary of State for a period of not more than six months. Clause 9
authorises the application of the Mutiny Act to volunteers when in
training with militia or regular forces. Clauses 10 to 13 contain fur-
ther provisions as to compensation to officers on abolition of purchase.
Clause 14 recites that returns relative to the militia are to be made to
persons authorised by the Secretary of State, and clause 15 transfers
to the commanding officer of any regiment of militia or yeomanry
the authority to issue orders for their billeting, which are to have the
same force as if given by the lieutenant of the county. Clause 16
authorises the Government in times of emergency to take possession of
railroads and railway plant for a period of a week, with power to
renew the occupation from week to week, the State meanwhile fulfill-
ing the contracts entered into by the company or persons to whom
the railroad belongs, and paying compensation for any loss or injury
caused during the time of its occupation. Clause 17 extends the pro-
visions of part V of the Volunteer Act of 1863, entitled “ Acquisition

of Land for Ranges," and provides for the acquisition of land by ali
the auxiliary forces for stores, drill sheds, or any other military pur-
poses, militia, yeomanry, and volunteers being all placed on the same
footing in this respect.
II, CHURCH AND EDUCATION,
UNIVERSITY TESTS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 26.—June 16, 1871.]
An Act to alter the Law respecting Religious Tests in the Universities
of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham, and in the IIalls and Colleges of
those Universities.
The preamble of this Act recites that whereas it is desirable to
render accessible to the whole nation the benefits of the Universities of
Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham, it is expedient to remove, under
proper safeguards, the restrictions, tests, and disabilities which at pre-
sent debar Her Majesty's subjects from the enjoyment of the same.
Clause 2 defines the terms used in the Act, and clause 3 enacts that
no persons taking lay academic degrees, or holding lay academie,
or collegiate offices shall in future be required to subscribe any for-
mulary of faith, but it also recites that nothing in this section shall
render a layman or a person not a member of the Church of Englanc
eligible for an office hitherto restricted to persons in holy orders,
or shall remove the obligation for those who fill such offices to
enter holy orders, nor shall it open offices hitherto filled by member3
of the Church of England to persons not so qualified. Clauses 4,
and 5 lay down the relation of the Act to religious instruction in
the universities and colleges, enacting that the governing body of
any college existing at the time of its passing shall provide sufficient
religious instruction for all members in statu pupillari belonging to the
Established Church, and that morning and evening prayer shall be
used as heretofore in the college chapels, except in cases where an
abridgment of the offices may be authorised by the visitor on the
request of the governing body. Clause 7 relieves any person from
attendance at college or university lectures if he, being of age, or his
guardians if he is a minor, hold objections to such attendance on
religious grounds. This Act repeals several sections of the Act of
Uniformity of the Popish Disabilities Act and of the Roman Catholic
Emancipation Act.
ECCLESIASTICAL DILAPIDATIONS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 43.—July 13, 1871.]
An Act for the Amendment of the Law relating to Eeclesiastical
Dilapidutions.
The preamble of this Act recites that" as well for the better susten-
tation of houses of residence, chancels, and other buildings which in-
cumbents of ecclesiastical benefices and other ecclesiastical persons
are by law or custom bound to maintain in repair, as also for the
relief of such persons and their representatives, it is expedient to
amend the law relating to ecclesiastical dilapidations.” Clauses 1 to 7
define the terms mentioned in the Act and provide that although a build-

a
ing may be situated out of a certain diocese it shall be deemed for the
pụrposes of the Act to be situated within the diocese of the bishop in
whose jurisdiction the benefice lies, and it also enacts that during the
vacancy of a see, the guardian of the spiritualities of a diocese shall
exercise the same power as the bishop. Clause 8 to 11 provide for the
appointment of surveyors of dilapidations in each diocese by the
archdeacons and rural deans assembled under the presidency of the
bishop or senior archdeacon. Such surveyors are to be responsible to
the bishop who is authorised to hear complaints against them, and to
remove them from office. The surveyors and the bishop's secretary
and registrar are to be paid for all work done under the Act according
to a fixed table of fees, and it is to be illegal for them to be beneficially
interested in any work or contract executed in connection with the
Act. Clauses 12 and 13 authorise the bishop to order an inspection of
dilapidations to be made on the complaint of an incumbent, arch-
deacon, rural dean, or patron, the copy of the report to be forwarded
within a month to the bishop and the incumbent, or to the sequestrator
if the benefice is under sequestration. By clause 16 the incumbent
may make objections to the surveyor's recommendations, but the
bishop's decision is to be final. To repair the dilapidations the in-
cumbent may borrow from the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty
(Clause 17), who are to keep a dilapidation account for the benefice
(Clause 17), and in any case he is to execute the works within the
time directed by the bishop (Clause 18). Clause 22 permits the
incumbent, on the complaint of the archdeacon or rural dean, to
effect the repairs within 21 days, without further proceedings before
the bishop, but if he neglects to do so after the final recommendation
of the inspector is sanctioned by the bishop his lordship is authorised
to obtain the necessary funds to carry out the work by sequestrating
the benefice reimbursing himself for all expenses incurred in such
proceedings (Clause 23). A vacancy in a benefice is not to affect the
method of procedure (Clause 24). Clauses 25 to 28 inclusive, apply
the Act to the houses of residence of archbishops, bishops, deans, and
Clauses 29 to 43 refer to dilapidations on vacant benefices.
On the avoidance of a benefice the surveyor is to report as to
dilapidations within three calendar months after the benefice is
vacant, and the same course as to objections and final decision is to
be pursued as laid down in previous clauses, the cost of repair being
defrayed by the late incumbent, and forming a debt from him to the
new incumbent, recoverable in a court of law, or in equity. The new
incumbent is to pay all moneys received from his predecessor, on
account of dilapidations to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty,
who may advance money to him for repairs on the security of the
benefice. Clauses 44 to 53 relate to the execution of the works, and
provide that in the case of the refusal of an incumbent to have repairs
executed, or when a benefice is sequestrated, the surveyor may employ
builders to carry them out, by order of the bishop. No further
repairs are to be required from an incumbent for five years, nor is any
inspection necessary during that period, unless a benefice becomes
vacant, in which case the incumbent, or his representatives shall only
be liable for wilful waste. Clause 54 enacts that an incumbent
shall insure all buildings on his benefice and the chancel of the church,
if he is liable for its repair, to the extent of at least three-fifths of the
value, in an office or offices approved by the Governors of Queen
canons.

Anne's Bounty, the receipts for the premium to be exhibited to the
archdeacon at his first visitation after it becomes payable, and a
declaration that the payment has been kept up is to be
made annually
by the incumbent. Buildings not insured if destroyed by fire are to
be restored by the incumbent, or if the living be sequestrated the cost
of the restoration is to be a charge on the moneys received by the
sequestrator. The remaining clauses of the Act, 58 to 73, provide
against certain contingencies and complete the enactments on all points
not fully detailed in previous clauses.
RESIGNATION OF INCUMBENTS.
66
a
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 44.—13th July, 1871.]
An Act to enable Clergymen incapacitated by illness to resign their
Benefices, with Provisions of Pensions.
This Act, consisting of thirteen clauses, after defining the terms
“incumbent,” “ benefice," " bishop,” and “patron,” provides (Clause 5)
that, on a representation being made to the bishop in the form con-
tained in a schedule at the end of the Act by the incumbent of any
benefice who has held the incumbency for seven years continuously,
that he desires, on the ground of being incapacitated by permanent
mental or bodily infirmity from the due performance of his duties, to
retire from his benefice under the provisions of this Act, it shall be
lawful for the bishop to cause a commission to be issued under his
hand and seal, addressed to five persons (Clause 6), including the arch-
deacon or rural dean, two incumbents of the diocese (one named by
the bishop and the other by the incumbent), a local magistrate (to be
nominated by the chairman of Quarter Sessions or the Lord Lieu-
tenant of the county), and another to be nominated by the patron ;
these commissioners are to make their return to the bishop
within three months. If the return shall certify that the resignation
is expedient, and the patron of the living consents, the bishop shall
cause a declaration to be prepared specifying the amount of pension to
be allowed out of the benefice to the retiring clergyman (Clause 9).
This pension is to be a legal charge on the said benefice, recoverable at law
(Clause 10); it is in no case to exceed one-third part of the net annual
value of the benefice resigned ; and it is provided that no benefice
shall be charged at one and the same time with more than a single
pension. There are other clauses limiting the Act in its operation to
England and Wales and the Channel Islands (Clause 3) ; enabling the
commissioners to examine witnesses on oath touching matters which
they may judge to be material (Clause 8); holding the pensioned
clergyman still amenable to the same ecclesiastical discipline to which
he would have been subjected as an actual incumbent (Clause 13) ; pro-
viding that the parsonage house shall in no case belong to the retiring
clergyman, but to his successor (Clause 14); allowing for the cessation or
variation of the pension under certain circumstances (Clause 15); and
providing in certain cases for an appeal to the archbishop (Clause 9);
There are further regulations, as to the costs of the commission and
the fees of the bishop's secretary or registrar of the diocese (Clauses 16,
17); and Clause 18 enables the committee of the estate of a lunatic
incumbent to exercise in his name and on his behalf the right of
resigning his benefice (Clause 18). In the event of the patron refusing
i

>
his consent, it is provided that the archbishop shall decide whether
such resignation shall be accepted or not, and that such decision shall
be final.
SEQUESTRATION OF LIVINGS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 45.—13th July, 1871.]
An Act for amending the Law relating to Sequestration of Eccle-
siastical Benefices.
This Act applies the Statute 1 and 2 Victoriæ, cap. 106, relative to
Ecclesiastical Benefices. It provides that where a living is sequestrated
under the Incumbents' Resignation Act, 1871 (see previous paragraph),
or owing to his bankruptcy, the sequestration continuing in force for six
months, the bishop of the diocese shall at the expiration of that time
appoint such clergy as the case requires to perform the duty, with
stipends according to his discretion, provided that the outlay does not
exceed for a-
Population of 500, the sum of £200 per annum.
1,000,
£300
3,000,
£500
Above 3,000,
£600
And provided also that the whole of such stipend or stipends shall
not exceed two-thirds of the annual value of the benefice. The
bishop may at any time revoke the appointment and licence of
clergy thus appointed, and may inhibit the clergyman whose benefice
is sequestrated from officiating in his diocese. During the period of
sequestration the right of patronage belonging to any benefice lapses
to the bishop, and the incumbent of a sequestrated benefice is precluded
from accepting any other benefice without the consent of the bishop
and the sequestrator.
ECCLESIASTICAL TITLES.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 53.-24th July, 1871.]
An Act to repeal an Act for preventing the Assumption of certain
Ecclesiastical Titles in respect of places in the United Kingdom.
This short Act repeals the Statute 14 and 15 Vict., cap. 60 which
imposed certain penalties on persons assuming territorial titles as
archbishop, bishop, or dean of places in England or Ireland, other
than those recognised by law. The preamble declares the effect of
the measure, and the single clause provides that “such repeal shall
not in any way authorise or sanction the conferring or attempting to
confer any rank, title or precedence, authority, or jurisdiction on or
over any subject of this realm, by any person or persons in or out of
this realm other than the Sovereign thereof."
PRIVATE CHAPELS IN SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 66.- 14th August, 1871.]
An Act to amend and define the Law relating to Private Chapels and
to Chapels belonging to Colleges, Schools, Hospitals, Asylums, and
other Public Institutions.
This short Act consists of three clauses with a preamble declaring
that “it is expedient to amend the law relating to certain chapels."

Abstracts of Important Acts of Parliament. 219
The first clause provides that the Bishop of the Diocese may license
a Clergyman to “
any chapel belonging to any college, school, hospital,
asylum, or public or charitable institution," to serve such chapel and
administer Therein the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and perform
such other offices and services of the Church of England as
shall be specified in the license with the exception of the solemni-
sation of marriage. The next clause provides that such licensed
Clergyman is to be “subject to no control or interference on the part
of the incumbent of the parish,” but, at the same time, is in no way
to interfere with his “cure of souls.” It is also directed that the
offertory at licensed private chapels is to be disposed of “
Minister thereof shall determine, subject to the direction of the
ordinary."

THREATS AND MOLESTATIONS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 32.—29th June, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Criminal Law relating to Violence, Threats, and
Molestations.
This Act renders any person liable to an imprisonment, with or
without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months, who
uses violence to any person or property ; who threatens or intimidates
any person in such a manner as would justify a justice of the peace,
on complaint made to him, to bind him over to keep the peace; who
molests or obstructs any person, as defined by the Act, with a view to
coerce him—that is, being a master, to dismiss or to cease to employ
any workman, or being a workman, to quit any employment or to
return work before it is finished ; being a master not to offer, or being
a workman not to accept, any employment or work; being a master or
workman to belong or not to belong to any temporary or permanent
association or combination ; being a master or workman to pay any
fine or penalty imposed by any temporary or permanent association or
combination ; being a master to alter the mode of carrying on his
business, or the number or description of any persons employed by
him. A person is to be deemed to molest or obstruct another if he
persistently follow such person about from place to place; if he hide
any tools, clothes, or other property owned or used by such person to
deprive him of or hinder him in the use thereof; if he watch or beset
the house or other place where he resides or works or carries on
business or happens to be, or the approach to the house or place, or if
with two or more persons he follow such person in a disorderly manner
in or through any street or road. The provision is not to prevent any
person being liable to any other or higher punishment, except that
he is not to be punished twice for the same offence. No person is to
be liable to punishment for doing or conspiring to do any act on the
ground that such act restrains or tends to restrain the free course of
trade, unless such act is one specified by the new statute and is done
with the object of coercing as already mentioned. The second clause
enacts that all offences under this Act shall be prosecuted under the
provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, under certain conditions,

and the third clause provides for an appeal by any person aggrieved at
a decision by the Court of Summary Jurisdiction. The fifth clause
provides that no interested person, either master, father, son, or
brother of a master in the particular manufacture, trade, or business
in or in connection with which any such offence has been committed
shall be eligible to serve as a member of a Court of Summary Jurisdic-
tion or Appeal for the purposes of this Act.
DISCHARGE OF PAUPERS FROM WORKHOUSES.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 108.—21st August, 1871.]
An Act to regulate and control the Discharge of Paupers from Work-
houses and Wards provided for the Casual Poor.
The object of the statute as stated in the preamble is to remove
doubts as to the length of time for which paupers may be lawfully
required to remain in workhouses after giving notice of their intention
to discharge themselves, also, to make provision for regulating and
trolling the discharge of paupers from workhouses and wards pro-
vided for wayfarers and wanderers, and for dealing with disorderly
paupers in the workhouse, and for the suppression of vagrancy. The
Act is not to apply to Scotland or Ireland. A pauper, wishing to
quit the workhouse, who has not previously discharged himself within
a month, is to give twenty-four hours' notice ; if he has discharged
himself once or oftener within a month, forty-eight hours' notice; if
more than twice within two months before giving the notice, seventy-
two hours. The guardians can detain a pauper for these periods, but
they (or the master if the board is not sitting) may make exceptions
in cases where they think fit. The fifth clause enacts that "A casual
pauper shall not be entitled to discharge himself from casual ward
before eleven o'clock in the morning on the day following his admis-
sion, nor before he has performed the work prescribed for him as here-
inafter mentioned, and where a casual pauper has been admitted on
more than two occasions during one month into any ward of the same
union, he shall not be entitled to discharge himself before nine o'clock
on the morning of the third day after his admission, and he may at any
time during that interval be removed by any officer of the guardians
or by a police constable to the workhouse of the union, and be re-
quired to remain in such workhouse for the remainder of the period of
his detention.” There are provisions as to the metropolis, and a
casual who leaves the ward or refuses to do the work prescribed, or
makes a false statement for the purpose of obtaining relief, is to be
deemed an idle and disorderly person, and to be dealt with under the
3rd section of the 5 Geo. 4, c. 83, and after a first conviction to be
dealt with under the 4th section for destroying or injuring his clothes.
Workhouse officials may take disorderly paupers befcre justices with-
out a warrant. The guardians of every union are to provide proper
casual wards as the Poor Law Board consider necessary. There is
also a provision as to asylums for the casual poor in the metropolis.
The provisions as to the discharge and detention of paupers are to
take effect, notwithstanding the 5th section of the 5 & 6 Vict. c. 57.

And every
PREVENTION OF CRIME.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 112.—21st August, 1871.]
An Act for the more effectual Prevention of Crime.
This Act, which is to be cited as “The Prevention of Crimes Act,
1871,” has twenty-two clauses.
It first provides certain Amendments in the Penal Servitude Acts
(Clauses 3—5). Any constable may, if authorised by the chief officer
of police of the district, take into custody without warrant any convict
holding a licence, if it appears to such constable that he is getting his
livelihood by dishonest means, and may bring him before a court of
summary jurisdiction, where, if the court so decides, his licence is to
be forfeited. If the holder of such a licence is guilty of any breach of
its conditions, he may, on summary conviction, be liable to three
months' imprisonment. Every convict holding a licence is to notify
the place of his residence to the chief officer of police of the district in
which he resides, and when he changes his residence to notify the same
both in the district he leaves and in that to which he goes.
male holder of such a licence is once in every month to report himself
to the chief officer or to such person as he may direct. Failure to do
this is to be an offence unde Act, for which the licence may be
forfeited ; or, if the term of penal servitude has expired at the date of
conviction, he may be imprisoned for not more than one year.
The next provisions (clauses 6 and 7) relate to a Register of Crimi-
nals. Registers of convictions are to be kept in a prescribed form ;
that for England in London ; that for Scotland in Edinburgh ; that
for Ireland in Dublin. The gaoler of every gaol is to make returns of
the persons convicted of crime, and coming within his custody. Regu-
lations are to be made for photographing all prisoners convicted of
crime confined in any prison. Refusal to obey any regulation made in
pursuance of this section is to be deemed an offence against prison dis-
cipline. The expenses of keeping the register are to be paid by the
Treasury; the expenses of photographing the convicts are to be part
of the expenses incurred in the maintenance of the prison.
The next division (clauses 7 to 14) relates to the Punishment of cer-
tain Offenders. Where any person is convicted on indictment of a
crime, and a previous conviction of a crime is proved against him, he
shall, at any time within seven years after the last conviction, be sub-
ject to not more than one year's imprisonment for the following
offences :-(1.) Getting his livelihood by dishonest means. (2.) If
on being charged with any offence, and being required by a court of
summary jurisdiction to give his name and address, he refuses to do
so, or gives a false one. (3.) If found in any place under circumstances
to satisfy the court that he was about to commit or aid in the commis-
sion of an indictable offence, or waiting for an opportunity to commit
sud offer (4.) If found in any dwelling-house, yard, building, pre-
mises, garden, &c., without being able to account to the satisfaction of
the court for being so found. For this last offence he may be arrested
by the owner or his servants, and detained until he can be delivered to
a constable. Where a person is convicted after a former conviction,
the court may direct that he be subject to police supervision for seven
years or less. Every person subject to such supervision is to report
himself to the police in the same manner as is above provided for a

a
convict having a licence, under penalty of imprisonment for not more
than one year. The rules of procedure on indictments contained in 24
and 25 Vict., c. 96, are to be applicable to indictments under this Act.
Every keeper of a lodging-house, beerhouse, or public-house, or place
where intoxicating liquors are sold, or any place of public entertainment
or public resort, who knowingly lodges or harbours thieves, or reputed
thieves, or permits them to meet or assemble therein, or allows the
deposit of goods, having reasonable cause to believe them to be stolen,
is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding 101., and, in default of pay.
ment, to imprisonment for not more than four months, and may also
be required to enter into recognisances for good behaviour for twelve
months. But the security is not to exceed 201., and the imprisonment
in default to be for not more than three months. The licence may also
be forfeited for a first offence, and must be so on a second offence, and
he is to be incompetent to hold any similar licence for one year.
Brothel keepers harbouring thieves or reputed thieves are to be subject
to a penalty not exceeding 101., and, in default of payment, to impri-
sonment for not exceeding four months. An assault on a constable in
the execution of his duty is to be punishable with a penalty not ex-
ceeding 201., or with imprisonment for not exceeding six months, and
on a second conviction within two years, for nine months. The old
metals named in a schedule in the Act, viz., lead, copper, brass, tin,
pewter, and German silver, are not to be purchased in quantities less
than those stated in the schedule, under a penalty of not more than 51.
When a woman has been twice convicted, any of her children under
fourteen, being under her care, and having no visible means of
subsistence, may be ordered by the court to be sent to an industrial
school.
The Act then proceeds (in clauses 15 and 16) to make the follow-
ing amendments in the criminal law :-Loitering by a suspected per-
son or reputed thief in any place with intent to commit a felony, has
been more fully defined, to meet a difficulty introduced by a recent
decision. It is further enacted that to prove the intent it shall not
be necessary to show any particular act tending to show the purpose,
but he may be convicted if it appears to the court that his intent was
to commit a felony. A chief officer of police may authorise, in writing,
any constable to search premises for stolen property where, first, they
have been within the preceding twelve months in the occupation of a
person convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty ; or,
secondly, when the person in the occupation of the premises has been
convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty. It is not
necessary to specify any particular property, but generally. In case of
seizure the property alleged to be stolen is to be brought before a court
of summary jurisdiction, and the occupier is to account for the posses.
sion of the same.
Clause 17 provides for the legal proceedings under the Act before
courts of summary jurisdiction. The description of the offence in the
words of the Act is to be sufficient. Any exemption, exception, &c., is
to be proved by the defendant, and need not be specified in the com-
plaint. No warrant or conviction is to be quashed for want of form.
A previous conviction may be proved by producing a record or extract
of such conviction and proof of identity. In case of indictable offence
a certificate signed by the clerk of the court or officer having custody
of the records of the court by which such conviction was made, is to be

admissible in evidence without proof of the signature or official character
of the person signing.
Clause 19 enacts that where proceedings are taken against any per-
son for having possession of goods knowing them to be stolen, or for
possession of stolen property, evidence may be given at any stage of
The proceedings of other property stolen within twelve months for the
purpose of showing guilty knowledge. And if any such person has,
within five years, been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dis-
honesty, evidence of such previous conviction may be given at any
stage of the proceedings, and may be taken into consideration for the
purpose of proving guilty knowledge; but in such case not less than
seven days' notice is to be given to the accused of such intended
proof.
The Habitual Criminals Act 1869 is repealed.
IV. FINANCE AND TAXATION.
BANK HOLIDAYS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 17.—25th May, 1871.]
An Act to make Provision for Bank Holidays, and respecting Obliga-
tions to make Payments and do other Acts on such Bank Holidays.
After reciting the expediency of making the day after Christmas-
day and certain other days Bank holidays, it is enacted (Clause 1)
that bills due on Bank holidays shall be payable on the following day,
and all proceedings shall be valid if done on such day as if it was the
actual day of payment. When the day on which notice of dishonour
should be given, or bills for presentation become due, falls on any
such holiday, the notice, &c., shall be good if given on the following
day (Clause 2). No person is compellable to make any payment on a
Bank holiday, which he would not be compelled to make on a Christ-
mas-day or Good Friday (Clause 3). The Queen is empowered to
appoint, by Proclamation, any day as a Bank holiday, or to alter, by
Order in Council, the days at present fixed for such holidays, appoint-
ing other days in their place, which shall be considered as Bank
holidays under this Act. The schedule declares the following days
to be Bank holidays :-Easter Monday; Monday in Whitsun week ;
first Monday in August; the 26th December, if a week day.
EAST INDIA STOCKS (DIVIDENDS) ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 29.—29th June, 1871.]
An Act to facilitate the Payment of Dividends on India Stocks.
This Act amends the twentieth section of the National Debt Act of
1870, and provides that the power then given to banks to send war-
rants through the post, shall, as regards India Stock, be in future
exercised, with the sanction of the Secretary of State for India
instead of the Treasury, and where the holder of any such Stock
desires to have his dividend warrant sent him by post, he shall make
his request, as provided in the National Debt Act, but on a form
approved by the Bank and the Secretary of State for India in
Council.

respect to the payment of such money in and out of Court, the invest-
ment and return thereof, the payment of dividends and interest
thereof, may be altered and revoked in the same manner as orders
with respect to other moneys controlled by the said Court. The
second clause recites that the words “chapter twenty-four” are to be
inserted in section 25 of the Life Assurance Companies Act, 1870, in
the place of the words “chapter forty-one,” and this alteration is to
be made by the Queen's Printer in all future copies of the Act.
STAMP ACT (1870) AMENDMENT ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 4.-30th March, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Stamp Act, 1870, in relation to Foreign Secu-
rities, Mortgages of Stock, and Proxy Papers.
This Act first repeals sections 113 and 114 of the Stamp Act of 1870,
and then proceeds to define what shall be deemed a “foreign security.”
Section 3 imposes a penalty on issuing any foreign security un-
stamped.
The stamp duty on proxy papers is to be id., and that on mortgage

LOANS UNDER THE POOR LAW ACTS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 11.—24th April, 1871.]
An Act to make further Provision in reference to Loans obtained
under the Poor Law Acts.
This Act is designed to enable boards of guardians who had con-
tracted loans prior to the Act of 1869 to avail themselves of its pro-
visions, and also to give additional powers in relation to loans. It
enacts that boards who have borrowed money before the Act of 1869
may extend the time for the repayment. Another section empowers
them to borrow money at a lower rate of interest for the purpose of
redeeming securities taken up at a higher rate. Half-yearly payments
may be made of annual instalments.
a

to the Superior Landlord.
The object of this statute is to protect the goods of lodgers against
the liability for distress for rent due to the superior landlord. It
enacts that where a superior landlord levies a distress upon the goods
of a lodger for rent due from his immediate tenant, such lodger may
serve upon the landlord or bailiff a declaration in writing stating that
such tenant has no right of property or beneficial interest in the goods
so distrained, and that they are the lawful property of such lodger,
and also what rent is due from such lodger to his immediate landlord,
which rent he may pay to the party distraining. To such declaration
is to be annexed a correct inventory, subscribed by the lodger, of the
furniture, goods, and chattels referred to in the declaration.
A wilfully false declaration issto be a misdemeanor.
A distress after such notice is to be illegal.
The lodger may apply to a justice of the peace for an order for
restoration of his goods, which application is to be heard by two
justices, who shall inquire into the truth of the declaration, and make
an order accordingly, and the superior landlord is also to be liable to
an action at law at the suit of the lodger.
BANKRUPTCY DISQUALIFICATIONS.

House of Lords.
The second clause enacts that every peer who becomes bankrupt
shall be disqualified from sitting or voting in the House of Lords or

deemed to have become bankrupt, first, when an order has been made
adjudicating him bankrupt; secondly, when a special resolution has
been passed under the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, declaring that his affairs
are to be liquidated by arrangement.
On the annulment of such order or adjudication the disability is
to cease,

[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 18.—25th May, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Law disqualifying Attorneys, Solicitors, and
Proctors in Practice from being Justices of the Peace for Counties.
This short Act repeals the statutes which disqualified attorneys,
solicitors, and proctors in practice from becoming justices of the
peace for counties, but it provides that no person shall be capable
of becoming or being a justice of the peace for any county in England
or Wales (not being a county of a city or county of a town) in which
he shall practise and carry on the business of an attorney, solicitor, or
proctor; and where any person carries on such business in any city or
town which is a county of itself, he shall, for the purposes of this Act,
be deemed to carry on the same in the county in which the city or
town is situated. Nothing in the Act is to affect coroners.

6. TRADE AND SHIPPING.
MERCHANT SHIPPING ACTS AMENDMENT ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 110.—25th August, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Merchant Shipping Acts.
This Act is divided into three parts, relating respectively to Parts
II, III, and IV, of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, under the
heads of “Registry,” “Masters and Seamen,” and “Safety.” It con-
sists of twelve clauses.
By Section 7, when a sailor is charged with desertion, or with
refusing to join his ship, or to put to sea, the court hearing such
charge have power on one-fourth of the crew, or one-fifth, if they
exceed twenty in number, alleging that the ship is not fit to proceed to
sea, or that the accommodation is insufficient, to order a survey to be
held, and to adjudge the case on the report of such survey. Such a
plea cannot be set up by the seaman charged, except where he shall
have, previously to his leaving the ship, complained to the master of
the state of the vessel, and if on investigation the ship shall be found
to be seaworthy, or the accommodation sufficient, the cost of the survey
is to be paid by the person demanding it; but if the ship is unfit to
proceed, the master, or owner, must bear the expense. By Section 5,
the Board of Trade may appoint officers to record the draught of water
of seagoing vessels on leaving port, and the master is bound to enter
such draught in his log-book. The record entered by the proper
officials is to be evidence in any subsequent proceeding of the draught
at the time of leaving port. The 10th section gives still further powers
to the Board of Trade. On the complaint of any person in writing,
containing the name and address of the complainant, the Board of

Trade have power to order a survey of a ship therein alleged to be
unseaworthy, and if the surveyor appointed by them reports the ship
to be in such a state that she could not proceed to sea without serious
danger to human life, they may declare her unseaworthy, and she may
be detained. Shipowners are protected to some extent from the danger
of unfounded accusations of unseaworthiness by the complainant being
made liable for costs in case of his not substantiating his complaint, but
they will have to pay costs if the ship be condemned. They are also
given a right of appeal from the report of the surveyor to the local
Admiralty Court, and such court has power to order a fresh survey,
and to make such order as to detention, costs, and damages as it may
see fit. To send a ship to sea in an unseaworthy condition, so as to
endanger life, is, by the 11th section, made a misdemeanour, and to
avoid conviction for the offence, the person sending the ship must show
(he may give evidence himself for this purpose) that he used all
reasonable means to keep her seaworthy, was ignorant that she was
not so, or that her going to sea was reasonable under the circumstances.
WORKSHOP REGULATION ACT (1867) AMENDMENT ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 19.—25th May, 1871.]
An Act for Exempting Persons professing the Jewish Religion from
Penalties in respect of young Persons and Females professing the
said Religion, working on Sundays.
This Act provides that no penalty shall be incurred by any person
in respect of any work done on Sunday, either in a workshop or
in the tobacco manufacture, by any young person or woman professing
the Jewish religion ; provided that :
(1.) The workshop or manufactory is in the occupation of a person
professing the Jewish religion, is on Saturday closed until
sunset, and is not open for traffic on Sunday:
(2.) That such workshop or manufactory is open on Sundays to
the officers authorised by the Factory and Workshops
Act, 1867 ;
(3.) The total number of hours of labour of such young person or
woman in any one week, or day, or period of twenty-four
hours, at such workshop or manufactory does not exceed
the period allowed by the Workshop Regulation Act of
1867.
FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACTS AMENDMENT ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 104.-21st August, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Acts relating to Factories and Workshops.
The preamble to this Act declares that it is expedient to provide for
the enforcement of the Workshops Regulation Act of 1867, by in-
spectors of factories and to amend the Acts relating to factories and
workshops. Clause 3 transfers the enforcement of the above named
Acts from the local authority, to the inspectors of workshops. Clause 5
provides that no female under the age of sixteen, or child under ten,
shall be employed in the manufacture of bricks and tiles, not being orna-
mental tiles. Clause 7 defines the accidents of which notice is required
to be given in a factory, and which are to include :-


## p. 228 (#336) ############################################

228 Abstracts of Important Acts of Parliament.
(1.) Any accident causing loss of life to persons employed in the
factory; and
(2.) Any accident causing bodily injury to persons employed,
and produced by machinery, or by explosion, or escape of
gas or steam, or metal, and of such a nature as to prevent
the person injured from returning to his work within
forty-eight hours after the accident.
Clause 8 relates to the penalties to be paid under the Act, and the
following clause gives lengthened details as to the means for the re-
covery of penalties in Scotland. Clause 10 declares that workshops
belonging to the Crown are not to be exempted from the Factory
Acts 1833-1871, although power is reserved to one of Her Majesty's
Principal Secretaries of State to exempt such an establishment tempo-
rarily from the provisions of the Acts. In the first schedule discre-
tionary power is given to the Secretary of State to relax these rules
under certain conditions in the case of trades where additional labour
is required at special seasons, giving notice of his intention to do so,
in the “ London Gazette.” The second schedule details the statutes
repealed by this Act.
)
TRADES UNIONS,
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 31.—29th June, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Law relating to Trades Unions.
This Act contains twenty-four clauses, divided into four principal
sections.
The second clause declares that a trade union is not to be deemed
unlawful by reason only of its being in restraint of trade. The third
clause provides that nothing in the Act is to enable any court to
entertain any legal proceeding instituted to recover damages for the
breach of any agreement :
(1.) Between members of a trade union concerning the conditions
on which any of the members shall or shall not sell their goods,
transact business, or employ, or be employed.
(2.) For the payment of a subscription or a penalty to a union.
(3.) For the application of the union funds to provide benefits for
the members, or contribution to any person not a member for acting
in conformity with the rules of the union.
(4.) For any agreement between one union and another.
(5.) For any bond given to secure any of these purposes.
The provisions of the Friendly Societies Acts are not to apply to trades
unions (clause 5). But any seven or more members subscribing the
rules of a union may register it under this Act, such registration to be
void if any one of the purposes of such union shall be unlawful
(clause 6). A registered union may purchase or lease land not ex-
ceeding one acre (clause 7). All property is to be vested in the
trustees, who may sue and be sued in respect of it. They are to be
liable only for moneys actually received by them. Treasurers and
other officers are duly to account, and any court of competent jurisdic-
tion may summarily inquire into any alleged default, and order delivery
up of books and papers and repayment of money, with a penalty not
exceeding 201., and on refusal, to imprison the offender for not more
than three months. Rules are enacted for registration of trade
unions, with a registrar appointed for the purpose (clause 13). The

rules are to be signed and deposited with the registrar, and a copy to
be given to any person applying for them for a shilling (clause
14). Such union is to have a registered office, and to make
annual returns of the receipts, funds, effects, and expenditure of
the union in such form as the registrar may direct, under a penalty
of 51., and 501. for making a false entry or omission in such return
(clause 15).
The registrar is to be the Registrar of Friendly Societies (clause
17). Circulation of false copies of the rules is to be a misdemeanor.
All offences and penalties are to be prosecuted and recovered under
the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The description of any offence in
the words of the Act is to be sufficient. An appeal is to lie to the
quarter sessions, but no interested person is to act as a member of the
court of appeal.
The term Trade Union is defined in Clause 23.
The Act is to be cited as “The Trade Union Act, 1871."
PUBLIC HOUSE LICENSES' SUSPENSION ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 88.—17th August, 1871.]
An Act to restrict during a limited time the grant by Justices of the
Peace of new Licenses and Certificates for the sale of Intoxicating
Liquors by Retail, and for other purposes.
The purpose of this Act is to suspend for one year the granting of
new licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors. The first section
enacts, that after the passing of this Act (17th August, 1871) until the
1st September, 1872, the justices shall not grant, otherwise than by
way of renewal, any new license, or any new certificate, under the
Wine and Beerhouse Act, 1869. But if it should appear to the
justices that such refusal would cause ' inconvenience to the locality
or to the public, or injury to any such person or body corporate,'
such justices may grant such license provisionally and shall forth with
send to the Secretary of State a report in writing of such provisional
grant, specifying the circumstances on account of which it was made.
The Secretary of State may confirm such provisional grant, and there-
upon the license is to be granted, but until so confirmed it is to have no
effect. The justices may remove a license from premises in their
division or in any adjoining division within the same county, to any
other eligible premises in their division, if in their opinion such
removal is necessary in order to meet the wants of the neighbourhood
to which the removal is made, and if no objection is made by the
occupier of the premises from which such removal is made, or by any
other person appearing to such justices to have reasonable ground of
objection to the removal. No appeal is to be allowed against a refusal
to remove, but against a removal any person interested in the premises
may appeal to the quarter sessions. The same notices are to be given
for a removal as for an application for a new license. The notice is to
be for one month and to be advertised in the newspapers. A doubt
having arisen with respect to the power of justices to exercise their
discretion as to granting a certificate where the license had ceased to
be in force by forfeiture, lapse of time, or otherwise, it is now enacted
by section 3, that in case of any such application, the justice shall have
the same discretion as on an application for a new certificate. It is
to be cited as “ The Intoxicating Liquors Suspension Act, 1871."

a
PEDLARS' ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 96.—21st August, 1871.]
An Act for granting Certificates to Pedlars.
This important Act, consisting of 25 clauses, repeals the Pedlars' Act
of 1870.
The first three clauses define the terms used in the Act. The fourth
provides that a penalty of not exceeding 10s. for the first, and 1l. for a
subsequent offence shall be imposed upon persons acting as pedlars
without a certificate. Clause 5 declares that the certificate is to be
granted by the chief officer of police in the district in which the appli-
cant has resided for one month previous to his application, such officer
being satisfied that he is above seventeen years old, a person of good
character, and in good faith intends to carry on the business. The
fee is to be 58., and the certificate is to remain in force for one year.
On proof of loss a new certificate may be granted. Clause 6 enacts
that this certificate will authorise the person to act as a pedlar within
the police district in which it is taken ont, but it may be extended by
indorsement to other districts than that for which it was granted.
A register of certificates is to be kept in each district (clause 8). A
certificate is not to be assigned nor borrowed (clauses 10, 11). Penal-
ties are inflicted for forging certificates or using forged ones (clause 12).
The possession of a certificate is not to exempt the bearer from any
provision of the Vagrant Act (clause 13). Convictions are to be in-
dorsed on the certificate (clause 14). An appeal against a refusal lies
to any court having summary jurisdiction, which may also deprive
the pedlar of his certificate (clauses 15, 16). The duties of a pedlar
are defined by clause 17. He is to produce his certificate on demand
to (1) any justice of the peace, (2) any constable or police officer, (3)
any person to whom he offers goods for sale, (4) any person in whose
private grounds or premises he is found, and if he refuse he may be
arrested by such person, and forthwith conveyed before a justice.
The police are empowered by clause 19 to examine a pedlar's pack.
Summary proceedings for offences under the Act are to be taken in
England before two justices or one police magistrate. Whatever may
be done under the Act by the chief officer of police may be done by
any police officer under his command duly authorised by him. Å
certificate is not to be required from (1) commercial travellers, (2) sellers
of vegetables, fruit, fish, or victuals, (3) persons exposing goods for sale
in any public market or fair.
7. LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 70.—14th August, 1871.]
An Act for constituting a Local Government Board, and vesting
therein certain Functions of the Secretary of State and Privy
Council concerning the Public Health and Local Government, to-
gether with the Powers and Duties of the Poor Law Board.
The preamble to this important Act declares that it is expedient
to concentrate in one department of the Government as hereinafter

provided the supervision of the laws relating to the public health, the
relief of the poor, and local government.
The second clause provides that a board shall be established, to be
called the Local Government Board, and from and after the establish-
ment of such board the Poor Law Board shall cease to exist, and all
powers and duties vested in or imposed on the Poor Law Board by the
several Acts of Parliament relating to the relief of the poor and any
other Acts, or vested in or imposed on one of Her Majesty's Principal
Secretaries of State, so far as such powers and duties relate to England,
shall be transferred to and imposed on the said Local Government
Board, and, except as otherwise
provided by this Act, shall be exer-
cised and performed by such Board in like manner and form, and
subject to the same conditions, liabilities, and incidents respectively as
such powers and duties might before the passing of this Act have been
exercised and performed by the authorities in whom the same were
then vested respectively, or as near thereto as circumstances may
admit.
The third clause enacts that the Local Government Board shall
consist of a president to be appointed by Her Majesty, and to hold
office during the pleasure of Her Majesty, and of the
following ex officio
members, that is to say :-—The Lord President of Her Majesty's most
Honourable Privy Council, all Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of
State for the time being, the Lord Privy Seal, and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer. The ex officio members are to receive no salaries.
The President and one of the Secretaries may, by the fourth clause, sit
in Parliament.
The fifth clause declares that a rule, order, or regulation made by
the Local Government Board shall be valid if it is made under the
seal of the Board, and signed by the President or one of the ex officio
members of the Board, and countersigned by a secretary or assistant
secretary.
Clause 7 refers to the powers of the Board, and clause 8 directs that
where under any Act, whether passed before or after the passing of
this Act, any return relative to any rate, toll, tax, or due raised in
England (other than such as is raised for the public revenue of the
United Kingdom) is required to be sent to one of Her Majesty's Secre-
taries of State or any other department of the Government, a duplicate
of such return shall in like manner be sent to the Local Government
Board, and any person failing to send the same shall be subject to the
like penalties as a person neglecting to send any return under the Act
of the session of the twenty-third and twenty-fourth years of the reign
of Her present Majesty, chapter fifty-one.
METROPOLIS WATER ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 113.]
An Act to amend "the Metropolis Water Act, 1852;” and to make
further provision for the due Supply of Water to the Metropolis, and
certain places in the neighbourhood.
This Act amends and repeals in part 15 and 16 Vict. cap. 84.
There are 51 sections in the Act and three schedules. The object of
the statute, as expressed in the preamble, is to make further provision
for securing to the metropolis a constant supply of pure and wholesome

232 Abstracts of Important Acts of Parliament.
water. It is with the recited Act (15 and 16 Vic., c 84) to be con-
strued as one Act. “From and after the passing of this Act (Aug. 21)
every company shall on Sundays as on other days supply sufficient
pure and wholesome water for the domestic use of the inhabitants
within their water limits.” After eight months from the passing of
the Act every company, when required so to do in the manner
directed, is to provide and keep throughout its water limits a constant
supply of water for domestic purposes, and make such water reach the
top story. After six months from the passing the metropolitan au-
thority may make application for a constant supply within such
district, and when not provided an appeal is given to the Board of
Trade. There are various regulations set forth in the statute, which
are to be published, and penalties to be recovered for non-compliance.
The companies may require owners and occupiers to provide proper
fittings,” which term includes communication pipes, and also all
pipes, cocks, cisterns, &c., used or intended for supply of water by a
company to a consumer, and
for that purpose placed in or about the
premises of the consumer. Power is given to enter premises for the
inspection and repair of the fittings. There are provisions as to fire-
plugs. The Board of Trade may appoint persons to inquire and
report on the quality of the water. There are various other pro-
visions to carry out the preamble, and section 48 provides that an
incoming tenant is not to pay the arrears of the outgoing tenant
unless by express agreement. The schedules annexed to the statute
explain the metropolitan authority, the districts, and the companies
mentioned in the Act.
66
PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 71.-14th August, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Public Libraries Act, 1853.
This Act empowers Local Boards to put the principal Act of 1853
in execution. They are not to expend for the purposes of the Public
Libraries Act more than one penny in the pound." They may borrow
on mortgage of the general district rate, or any separate rate. The
statute is not to apply to any district the whole or any part of which is
within any municipal borough or within the jurisdiction of Commis-
sioners under any Improvement Act.
VACCINATION.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 98.-21st August, 1871.]
An Act to amend the Vaccination Act of 1867.
This Act consisting of 17 clauses amends and applies the Vac-
cination Act of 1867. The first four clauses contain the title of
the Act, provide for its operations to commence on the 1st of January,
1872, and define the term “parent” wherever it is used in the Act
as including any person having the custody of a child. Section 5
recites that whereas under the principal Act the appointment of an
officer to enforce its provisions was optional, it is now made obligatory
on the guardians of every union and parish to appoint and pay an
officer for the purpose. Power is given to the Local Government
Board to exercise the same powers in matters relating to vaccination,

Abstracts of Important Acts of Parliament. 233
with respect to guardians and officers of guardians as they exercise
in all matters relating to the relief of the poor, and the Board is
authorised to issue books, regulations and forms for carrying out the
provisions of the Act, All fees received by the vaccination officer as
such are to be accounted for to the guardians. The term “ vaccination
officer," is to stand for "registrar of births and deaths," in the Act of
1867, except as regards the duties of giving notices to parents requir-
ing them to have their children vaccinated, described in section 15 of
that Act, which is still to be performed by the registrar. Public
vaccinators are to give parents without fee or charge, duplicates of the
certificates signed by them as to children being successfully vaccinated,
or as to their being insusceptible of or unfit for successful vaccination. The
original certificates are to be transmitted by the public vaccinator within
seven days after the operation has been performed. Parents whose chil-
dren are vaccinated by private practitioners are bound to forward a certi-
ficate of the result of the operation to the public vaccinator within
seven days, and he is to furnish them with a duplicate of the certificate
without fee or charge. Persons acting in contravention of or failing
to comply with the above provisions are liable to a penalty not
exceeding 20s., and persons signing a false certificate or duplicate are
liable to fine or to imprisonment with or without hard labour, for a
period not exceeding two years. Registrars are to furnish monthly
lists of births and deaths to the vaccination officers. Persons applying
to the public vaccinator for re-vaccination without charge are required
to present themselves at the end of seven days for inspection, and are,
on their request, to be furnished with a certificate of the result. On
failing to present themselves they are liable to a charge of 2s. 6d.,
which becomes a debt due by them to the guardians. Persons pre-
venting a public vaccinator from taking lymph from a child, or refusing
to present a child for vaccination, are liable to a penalty not exceeding
20s. Complaints may be made and information laid for any offence
against the Act of 1867, or 1871, within twelve months after the
offence was committed. Persons charged with neglecting to present
children for vaccination and subsequently found not to be guilty of that
offence, but of the offence of not transmitting the certificate to the
officer may be at once convicted of the latter offence by the justices as
if they had been charged therewith. Medical officers of Boards of
Guardians performing vaccination of persons in houses where small-
pox exists are to be paid the same sums as if they were public
vaccinators.
FAIRS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 12.—25th May, 1871.]
An Act to further Amend the Law relating to Fairs in England and
Wales.
It recites that certain fairs now held are unnecessary, the cause of
grievous immorality, and very injurious to the inhabitants of the towns
in which they are held, and it enacts that, on the representation of the
magistrates of any petty sessional division within which any fair is
held, that it would be for the advantage of the public to abolish it, the
Secretary of State may, with the consent of the owner of the fair given
in writing, order the abolition of such fair. But notice of such repre-
sentation is to be given in the local newspapers, as also of the order of
the Secretary of State when made.

GIFTS OF LAND FOR PUBLIC PARKS, SCHOOLS, AND
MUSEUMS.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 13.-25th May, 1871.]
An Act to facilitate Gifts of Land for Public Parks, Schools, and
Museums.
This is a relaxation of the law of Mortmain. It enacts that all gifts
and assurances of land of any tenure, whether by deed or will, for the
purposes of public parks, a school-house for an elementary school, or a
public museum, and all bequests of personal estate to be applied to the
purchase of land for such purposes only, shall be valid, notwithstand-
ing the Statute of Mortmain. But every will containing such gift, and
every deed making such gift for other than full and valuable considera-
tion, must be made twelve months before the donor's death, and
enrolled in the books of the Charity Commissioners. Not more than
twenty acres can so be given for a public park, not more than two acres
for a museum, nor more than one acre for any one schoolhouse.
8. MISCELLANEOUS ACTS.
POST OFFICE DUTIES.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 30.—29th June, 1871.]
An Act for the further Regulation of the Duties on Postage.
This Act, under which the Treasury Warrant for the reduced postal
rates commenced on October 5th was issued, enacts that it shall be lawful
for the Commissioners of the Treasury from time to time, by warrant,
to reduce the rates of postage to be charged on letters sent by post
between places in the United Kingdom, and to regulate the scale of
weight according to which such rates are to be charged, and to revoke,
alter, or add to any warrant previously made under the provision,
so, however, that the lowest rate of postage be not less than one
penny.” On the warrant mentioned taking effect the Acts recited are
to be repealed to the extent set forth in the schedule.
DOGS ACT.
[31 & 35 Victoriæ, cap. 56.—24th July, 1871.]
An Act to provide further Protection against Dogs.
This Act contains seven sections, and enacts that any police officer
or constable may take possession of any dog that he has reason to
suppose to be savage or dangerous, straying in any highway and not
under the control of any person, and detain it until claimed by the
owner and expenses are paid. If the owner is known to the
constable a letter is to be sent by post to him informing him of the
capture. After a detention of three days, where the owner is not
anown, and five days where he is known, without a claim and payment
of expenses, the dog is to be sold or destroyed, and if sold the money
to be paid to the account of the local rate. All dogs captured are to
be properly fed and maintained at the expense of the local rate. Any
court of summary jurisdiction having notice that a dog is dangerous
may make a summary order directing it to be kept by the owner under
proper control or destroyed, under a penalty of 201. for each day of
failure to comply with such order. The local authority may, on sus-
picion of a mad dog being within its district, make an order placing

such restriction as they may deem expedient on all dogs, not being
under the control of any person, for a prescribed period. Disobedience
to subject the offender to a penalty of 20s. Penalties to be recovered
under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The provisions as to deten-
tion, sale, or destruction of dogs found straying, are to apply to all
dogs found at large in contravention of any order.
PETROLEUM ACT.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 105.-21st August, 1871.]
An Act for the safe-keeping of Petroleum and other Substances of a
like nature.
This statute, which repeals 25 and 26 Vict. c. 66, 31 and 32 Vict.,
c. 56, and sections 8 and 9, of 29 and 30 Vict., c. 69, is to continue in
force till the 1st of October, 1872. In a schedule annexed directions
are given for testing petroleum to ascertain the temperature at which
it gives off inflammable vapour. By the Act harbour authorities are
to frame and submit to the Board of Trade for confirmation bye-laws
as to ships carrying petroleum, which are to be published ; and where
any ship or cargo is moored, landed, or otherwise dealt with, the
owner and master, or the owner of the cargo, is to be liable to a penalty
of 501. for each day during which the contravention of the bye-laws is
continued. The owner or master of a vessel carrying petroleum is to
give notice to the harbour authority on entering the place. Labels are
to be placed on all vessels containing petroleum. Regulations are to be
made as to the storeage of petroleum, and, if otherwise deposited, it is to
be forfeited and penalties are to be enforced. Licenses may be granted
for the keeping of petroleum, with an appeal to the Secretary of State.
Any officer authorised by a local authority may test petroleum in the
manner prescribed, with penalties for obstructing the officer or refusing
the liberty of testing. Power is given to search for petroleum, and to
seize the same if not properly kept. The Act may be applied to other
substances, and summary proceedings are to be taken to enforce the
provisions for the public safety.
INDUSTRIAL AND PROVIDENT SOCIETIES.
[34 and 35 Victoriæ, cap. 80.—16th August, 1871.]
An Act to amend and explain the Law relating to Industrial and
Provident Societies.
Doubts having arisen with respect to the powers given by the Act
of 1867, sec. 4, to Industrial Societies to purchase, erect and sell, and
sell and convey, or to hold lands with limited liability ; in order to
remove such doubts it is enacted by this Act that the rules of any such
society may provide for the erection and repair of houses or buildings,
and for the management and leasing, and disposal, and sale thereof to
members of the society or others, of any lands or buildings for the
time being held by the society, and for the appropriation of the pur-
chase moneys. And the rules may prescribe the form of conveyances,
mortgages, &c. In the case of copyholds so held the landlord is to admit
as tenant such person or persons as the society may appoint to be its
trustees on its behalf of such copyhold, on payment of the accustomed
fines and fees. A receipt indorsed on any mortgage is to be sufficient
discharge without a re-conveyance. All securities made before the pass-
ing of this Act are to be valid as if they had been made under its
powers.

NOTE.—The Necrological Table here given, contains the names of 160
distinguished persons of all countries, who died during tbe twelve months
from the commencement of November, 1870, to the middle of November,
1871. Of this number, no less than thirty-two, or 20 per cent., died at
the age of 80 or more, while five were upwards of 90, and oneman old
seaman who had served at the mutiny of the Nore-reached the well-
ascertained age of 106,—this fact solving some expressed doubts as to the
existence of centenarians.”

Premiums on Policies have been greatly reduced where parties have so applied the

liberality and promptitude in the discharge of claims made upon it during the many
years it has been established. No charge made for Policy Stamps.

FIRE risks of an eligible character are accepted at current rates of Premium.
LIFE ASSURANCES in a variety of forms are granted on moderate terms and
liberal conditions. Attention is specially directed to the Company's ENDOWMENT
ASSURANCE Tables, under which the amount of the Policies becomes payable at a
given age, or at death, if it shall happen before the stipulated age is attained.
WHOLE WORLD Policies are granted on favourable terms.
LIVES OF EUROPEANS RESIDENT IN INDIA are insured at a moderate addition to
the Home rates.
The Subscribed Capital of the Company is £5,000,000, of which
£550,000 has been paid up.
The Sums Assureil under the Life Policies in force with the Company at the close
of 1868, when the last actuarial investigation was made, amounted to £3,173,983,
and the Life Reserve Fund to more than £943,000 (which sum is exclusive
of, and in addition to, the paid-up Capital and the Fire Reserve Fund), being equal to
nearly 30 per cent. of the sums assured, or to more than 104 times the Annual Life
Premium Income. Under the Carlisle Table of Mortality, taking interest at 3 per cent.,
the estimated present value of the liabilities under the said policies was £762,953.
The total Funds of the Company are over £1,600,000, and the investments
are of the safest description, yielding interest at an average rate exceeding 45 per
cent. per annum.
In a Contract of the nature of Life Assurance, Security should obviously be
the first consideration, and it may be confidently asserted that the Policy-holders in
the Alliance enjoy the highest degree of security; for, besides an ample Accumu-
lated Reserve Fund, there is the additional guarantee of a Subscribed
Capital of not less than Hive Millions Sterling, coupled with the responsibility
of a numerous body of Proprietors.
Whilst the constitution of the Company has been framed so as to provide the
most undoubted Security, rendering it unquestionable that all engagements
entered into under the Policies issued by the Company will be faithfully discharged,
however remote may be the event upon which the sums assured become payable, the
Policy-holders under the PARTICIPATING SCHEME are now entitled to Eighty per
Cent. of the declared divisible Life Profits. Under the NON-PARTICIPATING
SCALE, Policies are granted at reduced rates.
Detailed Prospectuses, Proposal Forms, Statement of Accounts, and other papers,
may be had on application to

The Clergy and all others qualified to make Assurances upon Life in this Society are
informed that Assurances upon Life may be made upon payment of Reduced Annual
Premiums, viz., upon payment of “four-fifths" of the rates chargeable according to
the Society's Table, subject to certain conditions. A Prospectus setting forth the table
of reduced rates, and the special conditions referred to, may be had by application at
the Office.
Bonus.-The whole available Bonus is the sole property of Life Assurers; no part
whatever is taken from it to be shared amongst Proprietors. At the end of every
fifth year, profits are equitably apportioned amongst existing Life Assurances. By
means of Bonus upwards of One Hundred of the earlier Life Assurances have been
relieved altogether from the payment of Annual Premiums, and additions made to
sums Assured; £280,000 was divided amongst Life Assurances in May, 1871.
Assurers have the privilege at the time of making an Assurance of selecting the
mode in which the Bonus, whenever due, shall be applied, i.e., either in an immediate
Cash payment, or to the reduction of the Annual Premium, or to the increase of the
Capital sum assured.
Next Bonus in 1876. Assurances made previously to such year will share therein.
ASSURANCES may be effected on LIVES, SURVIVORSHIPS,
&c., &c., as stated in the Society's Prospectus, to any amount
not exceeding £7,500.
This Society is strictly confined to the Clergy of the Church of England and of the
Episcopal Church of Scotland, their Wives and Families, and the near relations of
themselves and Wives.
Prospectuses, Bonus Accounts, &c., to be had at the Office, on
personal application, or by letter.

Attention is particularly requested to the following important facts
resulting from the principles on which the Society was founded in the
year 1762, and upon which it has ever since been conducted :-
1. It has never allowed Commission or employed Agents
under any circumstances, whereby more than Two Millions
Sterling have been saved to the Assured.
2. Being a purely Mutual Office, the whole of the Capital
and Profits belong exclusively to the Assured, no portion being
diverted for dividends to Shareholders.
3. The invested Capital is upwards of £4,000,000,
4. The whole expenses of management are, on an average,
only about 24 per cent. on the Annual Income.
5. The Society accept the surrender of its policies at their
true value, without any deduction, thereby rendering loss by
forfeiture totally unnecessary.
6. The lives of persons residing at a distance from London
are assured without requiring their personal attendance at the
Office. Assurances can thus be effected without expense, or the
intervention of Agents, by direct correspondence with the Office
in London.

The New BUSINESS of 1870 comprised insurances for £347, 150; and the Premiums
received thereon amounted to £14,520 198. 8d.
The Total INCOME of 1870 was £138,088, and the available Assets at the end of
the year were £793,054.
The EXPENSES OF MANAGEMENT are now only Four per Cent, on the Income.
The PREMIUMS are calculated for every half-year of age.
The realized Profits are ascertained every Five Years; and NINE-TENTHS of the
whole are divided among the Assured. As considerably more than one-tenth of the
Profits is derived from Policies which do not Participate in the Profits, it will be seen
that the Assured have greater advantages in this Society than if they formed a Mutual
Insurance Company, dividing among themselves the whole of the Profits derived from
their own Policies.

LIFE DEPARTMENT.
Premiums moderate: terms and conditions liberal.
Participating Policy-holders receive every 5 years four-fifths of the Profits
realised. Surrender Values given after the payment of only one Premium.
The LIFE FUNDS amount to nearly £1,500,000, invested in first-class Securities.
The LIFE INCOME is nearly £200,000.
The claims paid (without litigation) have exceeded £5,000,000, exclusive of
Bonuses. The Expenses of Management average only 10 per cent. on the Premium
Income.
Advances are made on Policies which have acquired sufficient value.
Policies are issued for the benefit of the wife of the Assured, or of his wife anıl
,
children, or any of them, under the “ Married Womens' Property Act," thus creating
a secure family provision without the expense and trouble of Deeds.
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
Insurances against loss and damage by Fire are effected upon nearly every
kind of Property at home and abroad.
The Duty to Government is now abolished, thereby reducing the annual
charge for Insurance on ordinary risks to 18. 6d. per Cent.
No expense is incurred on effecting an Insurance, or in transferring Insurances
from other Offices, beyond the payment of the Premium.
The Accounts published under the “Life Assurance Company's Act, 1870,"
and the Company's Prospectus, give the fullest information respecting the state of the
Company's affairs, and the terms on which Fire and Life Assurances may be effected.

The ASSOCIATION employs no AGENTS, and pays NO COMMISSION
in any shape, for the introduction of Policies.
Its expenses are small, being about 2} per cent. of its gross income.
An investigation of its affairs is made every year, and the surplus
is applied solely to the reduction of the Premiums, such reduction
taking place immediately after the first seven payments.
During the last 30 years the reduction has increased, on an average,
at the rate of about One per cent. per annum, and as the mortality
among its Members continues to be much within the estimate, and
the funds of the Society are invested at a higher rate of interest than
is assumed in the valuations, it is expected that the Premiums may
be still further reduced.

FAMILY TRUST POLICIES.
TA
HE Act of Parliament, called the “Married Women's Property
Act, 1870," passed in the last_Session, having opened out a new
field for Life Assurance, Special Forms of Trust Policy have been
prepared for assuring the life of a husband for the separate benefit of
his wife, and also for the separate benefit of his wife and children.
By the “Married Women's Property Act,” such Policies are free
from Liability to the Creditors of the Husband's Estate ; consequently,
this form of Assurance is especially to be recommended where a
provision for a family is desired.
For Forms of Proposal, apply to the Society's Agents, or to

INSTITUTED 18 20.
The whole amount at present assured by this Company, including Bonusos,
is about £2,800,000, and the Annuities for which it is liable amount to
about £1,744 per annum.
The Assets actually invested in First-class Securities amount to
upwards of a Million sterling.

thus leaving a further sum of £675,000, which a numerous and wealthy
Proprietary body can be called upon to pay. The Proprietors' Dividends
are paid exclusively out of the Interest arising from their own Investod
Fund.
The last division of Profits was to 31st January, 1871; the next will be
in 1876.

NATIONAL
LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,
2, KING WILLIAM STREET, LONDON, E.C.
FOR MUTUAL ASSURANCE.
ESTABLISHED 1830.
Assurance Offices may be classified under two heads :
1st. Those which are conducted solely and entirely in the interests of
the Assurers.
2nd. Those which are conducted partly for the benefit of the Assurers
and partly for that of Shareholders and Agents.
The “National” belongs to the first class.
It does not pay Commission, or any equivalent for it, for the introduc-
tion of business, and consequently employs no Agents to recommend it.
But it offers great advantages to Assurers in the two points of most
importance to them, viz. :-
Safety, which is guaranteed by a Reserve Fund exceeding £600,000,
being in the unusually large proportion of more than 90 per cent. of
the whole of the premiums which have been received upon existing
Policies; and
Large Bonuses, the whole of the profits being applied in the gradual
reduction and ultimate extinction of the Assurer's premiums.
Full Prospectuses may be obtained post-free on application to
