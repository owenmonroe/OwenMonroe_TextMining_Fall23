      " was 305,000,000 francs ; of the raw wool, 105,000,000 : \n",
      " the quantity exported was about one-thirteenth of the \n",
      " whole quantity manufactured. By the exertions of \n",
      " Henry IV., the mulberry.tree was cultivated in all the \n",
      " southern provinces. At Tours, silk stuffs for furniture \n",
      " are chiefly manufactured ; at Ganges, and other places \n",
      " in the Cevennes, silk stockings. Lyons is the princi- \n",
      " pal place for silk manufactures of all kinds. Paris \n",
      " ranks next after Lyons. In 181'.!, the value of the \n",
      " raw material amounted to 45,500,(HIO francs, of which \n",
      " 33,000,000 were the price of imported silk. The va- \n",
      " lue of manufactured goods, at the same period, was \n",
      " 107,500,000 francs, m' which less than one-third was \n",
      " exported. Forty years ago, the spinning of cotton by \n",
      " machinery waa hardly practised in France. Cotton \n",
      " mills have l>een established within that period, and \n",
      " the manufactures of Alsace are now superior to those \n",

      " dustry of that c<iuntry cannot enter into competition \n",

      " depress it is the want of internal communication by \n",
      " roads and canals. The practicable roads of France \n",
      " are not more than one-third of the extent of those of \n",
      " England. The cross-roeds are few, and the great \n",
      " roads are seldom kept in good order. The length of \n",
      " the canals in France is not more than one- eleventh of \n",
      " those of England. Another point in which France is \n",
      " inferior is in the use of steam.engines, attributable In \n",
      " part to the deficiency of coal, or the dlHiculty of trans- \n",
      " porting it. The total force of steam-engines iu France, \n",
      " according to Dupin, is ecpial to Jiat ol 480,(f(K> men ; \n",
