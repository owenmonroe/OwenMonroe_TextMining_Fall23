Deficiency in expressive reading and \\n effective speaking has been observed and deplored for years. \\n Within the last score of years, schools of oratory, elocntion, \\n Delsarte, physical and vocal culture, and many institations \\n of less pretentious title have demonstrated the assertion \\n \\'that, ■ \\' Crood reading is attainable b^ the masses. \" \\n \\n The day will never come when the memorizing and recit- \\n ing of poems and choice prose efforts by our best writers and \\n greatest orators will cease to be popular with our American \\n youth. It is a part of our inheritance to preserve the utter- \\n ances of the men and women who have, by their voice and \\n pen, done much to advance the spirit of truth, heroism and \\n patriotism — the chief characteristic of our American man- \\n hood and womanhood. This book, therefore, is presented to \\n the public in obedience to that trite commercial maxim, \\n \"The demand will summon the supply,\" \\n \\n The art of oratory is best acquired by the committing and \\n delivery of approved examples of speeches and poems ; hence \\n the aspirant for great oratorical skill should count no labor \\n lost that requires much study and practice of what othert \\n have written or delivered. Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Patrick \\n Henry, Burke, Phillips, Benton, Fox, Bryan and Sheridan, \\n as well as the great orators of antiquity — Demosthenes, \\n Cicero and Marc Antony, owed their wonderful elocutionary \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

In addition to the half thou- \\n sand or more choice readings, there is a brief, though prao \\n tical treatise on the Science and Art of Elocution, Oratory and \\n Rational Reading and Speaking, the essential features of \\n which are based upon the more exhaustive authoritative \\n works of the late Professor Isaac Hinton Brown — Common \\n School Elocution and Oratory and Rational Elocution and \\n Reading. Due acknowledgement is hereby made for matter \\n extracted from these books and from lectures delivered by \\n Prof. Brown before his classes in the University of Missouri. \\n \\n To present the Science of Human Expression and Rat- \\n ional Reading and Speaking in a manner so simple, so con- \\n cise and so reasonable that no student with average zeal, \\n ability and native wit, would experience difficulty in compre- \\n hending and applying all fundamental principles, has been the \\n aim of the authors. While an effort has been made to render \\n the exposition free from technical and professional theories, \\n ev^ry principle announced and enforced has been drawn from \\n nature by the scientific researches of the foremost teachers \\n and writers of Delsarte, Elocution, Vocal and Physical \\n Culture of Europe and America. \\n \\n The prominence given to the subject of Respiration is \\n justified in the recognition of its three-fold relation to Elocu- \\n tion and Delsarte: First, energy and ease of expression are \\n largely dependent upon a proper control of the respiratory \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Consumption has been held to be \\n incurable, but there are innumerable cases on record where a \\n permanent cure has been effected by the judicious exercise \\n of the vocal organs with accompanying gymnastic exercise, \\n Delsarte and gesture. — 0.

That the people in general are defi- \\n cient in their powers of vocal expression is an unpleasant com- \\n ment upon our system of education ; but if we attribute the \\n vocal deficiency of the masses to the confessedly meager \\n vocal drill in our common schools, how shall we account for \\n the delinquency of many of our literary people whose vocal \\n accomplishments are barely sufficient to render them intelli- \\n gently entertaining upon such familiar topics as the current \\n events 7 How many of this latter class can you name, of \\n whom it may be said their words issue from their lips with \\n that easy flowing and delightful continuity which implies \\n not only a profusion and activity of thought, but a power \\n and vigor of expression which rouses the listless ear and \\n leads the sluggish and perhaps unwilling fancy through the \\n realms of mental wonderland ? \\n \\n Of all the recognized professions none requires in its \\n perfection so many and varied accomplishments as that of \\n oratory. The public lecturer who leads the van in the \\n EQaxch of science for the improvement of society, the states- \\n is \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

I \\n \\n man who guards the nation\\'s rights and shapes his country\\'s \\n destiny, the man of God who seeks to purify the human \\n lieart and save a fallen race — all must wield the wonderous \\n power of speech. \\n \\n The power to charm the heart and steal away the senses ; \\n to divert the mind from its own divisings and hold an audi- \\n ence in breathless spell as the orator paints the rosy \\n tints of heavenly longings, or leads the imagination down \\n through the labyrinths of wonderland, or depicts with light- \\n ning tongue and thunder tones the horrors of the doomed, \\n comes not by natare, but by work, work, work. Whether \\n this so-called gift be assisted by early efforts, as in the case \\n of a Demosthenes declaiming over the sea-beat cliffs of At- \\n tica, or the harangues of a youthful Clay before a group of \\n oxen, perfection in speech is attained only by frequent and \\n long continued practice, based upon accurate observation and \\n zealous study. The art of conveying thought in an easy, \\n graceful and forceful manner should be held chiefest above \\n all other accomplishments. The complete mastery of the \\n principles of speech therefore, enables one not only to express \\n his thoughts clearly and easily, but to so vivify and illuminate \\n those thoughts that his hearers see, hear and feel the un- \\n questioned truth of his argument. \\n \\n The gift of reason to the human race derives its value \\n from the gift of speech; but the speech of nature is so tram- \\n meled by habit and corrupted by association, that the prompt- \\n ings of our God-nature, as revealed in speech are practically \\n ignored. If we go to nature and endeavor to apply her \\n teachings to our expressions, we readily see that what we \\n call < \\' second nature \" is simply habit — correctly or incorrect- \\n ly formed. We should therefore cultivate pleasant tones \\n and correct and distinct articulation. \\n \\n It is a duty imposed at birth to make the best use of \\n every talent of which we are possessed; it is equally a duty \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Polite- \\n ness, coupled with an attractiveness of manner, is the pass- \\n port which admits us to the. favorable attention of our \\n fellow men; but something more than suavity and outward \\n polish is required to command the consideration and contin- \\n ued high respect of the world. The hermit, withdrawing to \\n his forest cabin or mountain cavern, may with impunity \\n lapse into uncouth barbarism and give expression to his \\n aches and pains in rasping pectoral grunts, since no other \\n being is to be attracted or delighted by his words and man- \\n ners ; but woe to him who seeks amid the social hive for \\n human sympathy if he ignores his tones and speech. \\n \\n With simply an allusion to those unconscious and silent \\n impressions we make upon others, through the agency of \\n learning, wisdom, valor, beauty or physical strength, and \\n for which we are not always directly responsible, let us \\n speak of the active, intelligent and volitional manifestation \\n of speech — articulate speech, the preeminent characteristic \\n of the God-imaged rational man — the creative gift in para- \\n dise, through which the creature first learned to praise his \\n Maker, the deliverer of his imprisoned soul, whereby we \\n trace our origin to one common fatherhood. Though this \\n gift be oft abused, who would wish the power of speech \\n abridged ? Who would willingly forego the social chat, the \\n sweet commune of kindred spirits, the words of cheer, of love, \\n of hope, and all that makes life dear to faithful hearts? \\'Tis the \\n loved one\\'s speech that falls upon our infant ears from lipe \\n that press our own in ectasy of mother-love ? In time the \\n same fond lips prepare our own to frame the sweet \" Mam- \\n ma, \" and later on as we cast adrift from youths\\' maternal \\n moorings, the charm of words from other lips than those we \\n loved erstwhile, now steals upon our senses and holds us will- \\n ing captives at the shrine of love\\'s first offering.

The magical power of Henry \\n Clay\\'s voice, cultivated by years of patient study and intel- \\n ligent practice, was little less potent than the logic of the \\n arguments in persuasion or conviction. The orator, whether \\n in legislative halls, on the rostrum, or in the pulpit, must \\n look well to his tones and speech if he would emulate the \\n success of those masters whose individuality has left behind \\n them imperishable fame. \\n \\n The conditions of success in the finished orator lie as much \\n in the management of the voice and method of delivery as \\n in the sentiments uttered, for our tones and manners leave \\n their impress upon those with whom we mingle long after the \\n words we utter have been forgotten and we have passed to \\n the shadowy realms of the echoless shore. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

It is the key to nearly all the \\n other subjects with which the student and future citizen has \\n to deal. His success in mastering the concomitant branches \\n and, indeed, nearly every art, science and avocation, depends \\n upon the skill he secures at an early age in interpreting, \\n assimilating and retaining the thoughts of others, as pre- \\n sented upon the written or printed page. \\n \\n The ability to apprehend the wit, the fun, the hidden \\n wisdom beneath the author\\'s words, to grasp the central \\n thought, to group the lights and shades which modify or \\n ornament the worded picture, with the quickness of intu- \\n ition, must all be acquired in early life. But to scan the \\n prmted page in silence and note in mental concepts the \\n author\\'s woven thoughts is not all there is of reading; nor \\n can the skill by which the thoughts are grasped be attained \\n alone by silent reading. Months and years must he given to \\n the vocal utterances of written sentences, under the guid- \\n ance of the skillful teachers, before the child can adapt the \\n written words to his untrained comprehension. Silent and \\n audible reading are mutually dependent; the highest excel- \\n lence in either is acquired largely through the practice of the \\n other. \\n \\n RESPIRATION. \\n \\n Eespieation or breathing is the act of taking air into \\n the lungs and expelling it from them. As an art, respira- \\n tion involves processes whose mastery by the student is of \\n paramount importance: Inspieation, Expikation and \\n Management. \\n \\n Few persons realize how great is the influence of respira- \\n ation upon the growing life of a human being.

(#31) #################################################\\n\\nAND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 20 \\n \\n of the body. The properly trained singer and speaker are \\n rarely hoarse. Exemption from throat and lung troubles \\n among professional orators and singers is due to the skillful \\n use of eTcry organ involved in respiration, speech and song. \\n The public speaker or singer who excuses his performance \\n by confessing hoarseness thereby acknowledges his ignorance \\n and violation of one of nature\\'s simplest laws. \\n \\n If the teacher or student be disposed to ignore the \\n hygienic value of correct breathing, he is reminded that the \\n highest form of human utterance, whether aspirated or \\n vocalized in speech, or intonated in measured harmony, is \\n based upon the most intelligent command and use of the \\n respiratory apparatus. The stuttering, gasping, incoherent, \\n flighty, jerky or impetuous speech one sometimes hears \\n from a novice in the art of public speaking or singing, is \\n not traceable alone to. inexperience, but, in most cases, to \\n nervous embarrassment caused by imperfect respiration. \\n \\n \\\\t may be further stated that a larger part of the train- \\n ing course prescribed for orators and singers in professional \\n schools is devoted to securing command over the breath in \\n speech and song; and that the heart-reaching, soul-stirring \\n rendition of those sublime passages which have in ages past \\n moved the stoic to action and the sage to tears, can be re- \\n produced only, after all other conditions are presented, by \\n that perfect adaption of breath to the moulding of words \\n that live, and bum and glow — melting the heart to tears, \\n filling the ear with rapture and illuminating the soul with \\n celestial light, until the very air seems filled with seraphic \\n melodies of intelligences divine. \\n \\n Every muscle of the waist, chest, ribs, axilla, back and \\n loins must be brought into action, and trained by intelligent \\n and persistent practice to perform its function. It will take \\n several months — even years, with older students— to accus- \\n tom all the muscles to act automatically and effectively. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

It is the deep, full, vigorous breathers that possess \\n the most vigorous hearts, minds and bodies. \\n \\n METHODS OF BREATHING. \\n \\n While the ordinary methods of breathing are suflacientfor \\n the individual of vigorous outdoor pursuits, they ore not \\n sufficient for the scholar and man of thought engaged in \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#33) #################################################\\n\\nAND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 31 \\n \\n sedentary pursuits. With these the stimuliiM generated by \\n bodily action is wanting to induce the deep inspirations \\n peculiar to the active man of outdoor life. The thinker \\n within his closet, the artist at his easel, the artisan at hia \\n table and the pupil at his desk, require a constant reinforce- \\n ment of mental energy. Much more than any of these does \\n the orator, lecturer and public reader demand the recupera- \\n tive agency of a perfect respiration. The requirement can \\n be filled only by the inhalation of the abundance of the \\n vitalizing oxygen contained in pure air, and art must be \\n called in to properly supply and distribute the regenerative \\n fluid. \\n \\n GESTURE. \\n \\n Gesture includes all positions and motions of the head, \\n face and limbs, employed to enforce or illustrate an idea, \\n emotion, or passion. \\n \\n Its Importance — Gesture is the visible language of the \\n inner life. It portrays to the eye the workings of the mind, \\n the affections of the heart, and the varying passions and \\n emotions of the soul. It is as intelligible to the savage as \\n to the most enlightened. Entire plays are presented in pan- \\n tomime and are understood by observers as well as by the \\n players themselves. It gives to the eye what the ear often \\n fails to receive, and thus attracts and holds the attention \\n much more effectually than do words alone. \\n \\n He who would successfully appeal to all the senses of \\n his audience — hold the eye, the heart, the soul ; summon \\n the approving smile, the sympathetic tear, the rapturous \\n applause ; sway the multitudes, lull them into complacency, \\n or move them to immediate action — must cultivate and skill- \\n fully employ this universal language of nature. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Impressions are then \\n made which often affect his entire subsequent performance. \\n \\n The Walk — The walk is the mirror of character. \\n Through it the artist reads the very thoughts the performer \\n would conceal, and though we can change our walk only as \\n we change the temperament that walk portrays, we can by \\n practice secure a style of motion that will occasion no \\n unfavorable comment. \\n \\n Directions — Stand erect ; summon the most animated \\n thoughts; assume \"active chest\"; imagine yourself drawn \\n forward by a force acting about the waist ; preserve a per- \\n fect poise — the head well balanced, the chin neither pro- \\n jected nor retracted. \\n \\n Lift one thigh forward, the lower leg and foot hanging \\n loosely and straighten the knee, as the foot is planted as near- \\n ly flat as the high heel will permit. Follow with the other \\n limb in the same manner, observing that the chest is full, \\n the unseen power acting at the waist and the knee straight- \\n ening as the foot strikes the floor. \\n \\n The Bow — Standing in the First Position (see Positions), \\n after a momentary look into the eyes of the audience, bring \\n the right foot back so as to assume Second Position, bend \\n the body and head slightly and directly forward. In the \\n retiring bow, as the body bends forward bring the right toe \\n to the heel of the left foot, the right knee bent and pressed \\n firmly against the back of the left knee.

Beware of useless facial con- \\n tortions\\'; they are not only inappropriate, they are disfigur- \\n ing and repulsive. \\n \\n EXPRESSION OF THE EYES. \\n \\n The eye is the most expressive of all the features. It is \\n here the mysterious workings of the mind are imaged forth \\n in unmistakable language before the tongue moves in obedi- \\n ence to the will. \\n \\n From it the soul looks forth and communes with kindred \\n spirits. The expectant child reads in its mother\\'s eye the \\n answer to its wish. The stiicken heart, unable to bear the \\n burden, sends forth its mute appeals for human sympathy \\n through eyes that tell the inward sorrow. \\n \\n But while philosophers and poets have combined in \\n praise of the wondrous beauty, variety and expressiveness \\n of the eye, to the orator, it has peculiar interest which he \\n cannot ignore. It is not simply a means of expression, but \\n to the speaker it is an instrument of control second to no \\n other agency of oratorical power. The speaker who looks \\n directly into the eyes of his audience holds them beyond \\n their power of escape. Every person present feels the mag- \\n netic influence of the speaker and fancies himself the partic- \\n ular person addressed. \\n \\n The failure to use this wonderful power explains why \\n \\n so many desultory speakers and manuscript readers do not \\n \\n secure attention and move tlieir audiences to thought and \\n \\n action. If you must use a manuscript, acquire the habit of \\n \\n looking away from it at times and into the eyes of your \\n \\n hearers. \\n \\n GENERAL HINTS UPON GESTURE. \\n \\n \\' \\' Suit the action to the word and the word to the action ; \\n with this special observance — that you o\\'erstep not the \\n modesty of nature.\" \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Decision of \\n gestnre is more important than grace ; combine the two. \\n \\n In shifting from one foot to the other avoid dropping \\n either hip or shoulder. \\n \\n Though appropriate gesture is pleasing to the eye and \\n greatly assists the hearer in comprehending the thought, the \\n pupil is reminded that too little gesture is better than acou- \\n tinnona or even frequent sawing of the air. \\n \\n During the action of gesture the arm should be kept \\n moving all the time — rarely stationary for a single instant \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#47) #################################################\\n\\nAND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST 45 \\n \\n When reading, attempt no gesture unless you can look \\n from your book or manuscript and preclude the gesture with \\n your eyes. \\n \\n The ictus of the gesture should be on the emphatic \\n word, and the hand performing the gesture should return to \\n the side or proceed with another gesture. \\n \\n Keep your face full or three-quarters full toward your \\n audience, unless personation should require it otherwise. \\n \\n In personating two characters^ have one speak to the \\n right and the other to the left. Explanations require a full \\n face to the audience. \\n \\n Use curved lines in gesture in all cases except those \\n portraying sudden and impressioned emotions. \\n \\n As a general rule in single gesture, use the right arm, \\n with the right foot advanced in preference to the left. The \\n left, however, is often conveniently used in the mimicry of \\n awkward characters. \\n \\n Do not permit the love of dress display to mar the effect \\n of your delivery by making you appear ridiculous. Taste in \\n dress is little less important than appropriate language and \\n delivery. \\n \\n Let your changes in gesture accord with the language. \\n The more rapid the thought and violent the emotion, the \\n more sudden the transitions. Calm, dignified and reflective \\n thought requires slow, measured, graceful changes. \\n \\n When the change of thought requires a change of posi- \\n tion, make such change while speaking, not before nor after; \\n that is, move as you enter upon the new thought. \\n \\n Gesture should not accompany the description of the act, \\n but the act itself; as, \"But Dooglas round him drew his \\n cloak,\" etc., receives no gesture; wait till tho words accom- \\n panying the action are spokea. \\n \\n Observe the attitudes and pastures of great orators, \\n actors and successful lecturera. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

The usage of the twentieth century \\n is not that of the nineteenth. The general style of the \\n bustling metropolis differs from the leisurely uttered words \\n of the field and hamlet. The accent Bast is in contrast to \\n that of the West as marked as the dialect of the South dif- \\n fers from other sections. So, too, the followers of car- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#49) #################################################\\n\\nAND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 41 \\n \\n tain occupations manifest their calling by peculiarities of \\n ucctint and enanciation. The stress and tones of the sea- \\n faring man vary in a marked degree from those of the camp \\n and court. Again, the usage of the mountains is not that \\n of the plains and valleys; and the contrast between the artic- \\n ulation and accent one hears on the coast and in the inte- \\n rior is equally marked. \\n \\n Changes in pronimciation, due to changes in the manner \\n of living, social and political conditions, advance of com- \\n merce and caprice of fashion are constantly going on — ^in \\n some sections more rapidly than in others. While some \\n communities, influenced by the busy activities around them, \\n accept almost every new style of utterance, others, more \\n isolated, and, therefore, more- tenacious of early acquire- \\n ments, resist all innovations, and cling to those familiar \\n sounds to which they have been accustomed. Thus differ- \\n ences in pronunciation originate and continue in the same \\n country. \\n \\n Notwithstanding these differences in local usage, there \\n is a standard of pronunciation to which the critical scholai-a \\n of all sections conform. Among literary people of tlie \\n United States this standard is recognized in the latest edi- \\n tions of Webster\\'s International and the Century diction- \\n aries. Professor Brown, whose works on Elocution have \\n long been regarded as the most authoritative, especially on \\n Kespiration, Articulation and Pronunciation, recognized but \\n one standard authority \\'on pronunciation, viz., Webster\\'s \\n International Dictionary. \\n \\n The \"Principles of Pronunciation \" contained in the lat- \\n ter work, should be carefully studied by all who aspire to* \\n accuracy in spoken English. A mispronounced word, or \\n even an unusual authorized pronunciation coming from the \\n pulpit, stage or rostrum, distracts the hearer\\'s attention, \\n mars the beauty of diction, and compromises the speaker\\'s \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

A skillful articulation is acquired by first securing \\n the correct sounds of the vocal elements, and then by per- \\n sistent practice, making them so familiar to the tongue and \\n ear that every combination, however diflacult, can be sounded \\n instantly and correctly. \\n \\n ARTICULATION. \\n \\n Aeticulation is the process of forming and combining \\n the elementary sounds of language. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#51) #################################################\\n\\n.4ND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 49 \\n \\n The importance of this subject entitles it to rank second \\n only to respiration as a requisite to the greatest excellence \\n in the art of elocution and extemporaneous speaking. With- \\n out this element, cultivated to the highest perfection, all \\n other elements of vocal culture fail to form the accomplished \\n reader or speaker. \\n \\n Not by the English speaking orator alone, is articulation \\n deemed of great importance. French and German teachers \\n and statesmen give much attention to the subject. Says \\n Legouvfe: \"Articulation and articulation alone, gives clear- \\n ness, energy, passion and force. Such is its power that it \\n can even overcome deficiency of voice in the presence of a \\n large audience. There have been actors of the foremost \\n rank who had scarcely any voice. Potier had no voice. \\n Monvel, the famous Monvel, not only had no voice, he had \\n no teeth ! and yet no one ever lost a word that fell from hia \\n lips; and never was there a more delightful, more moving \\n artist than he, thanks to his perfect articulation. \" \\n \\n That articulation shall secure the greatest benefit to the \\n speaker two conditions must be observed: \\n \\n First — It must be correct. \\n \\n Second — It must be distinct. \\n \\n The first of these implies that the student shall acquaint \\n himself with the powers and applications of all the elemen- \\n tary constituents of the language, in order that he may know \\n the exact element required for each oral combination. The \\n second condition demands that he shall so completely master \\n the vocal utterance of every element that no mistake can \\n possibly arise as to what particular sound is uttered. \\n \\n Correctness of articulation is acquired by frequent refer- \\n ence to the standard dictionaries, supplemented by immedi- \\n ate and intelligent practice. Here it should be observed \\n that a distinct articulation without being correct is like legi- \\n ble writing containing many mispelled words; while it is \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Faulty articulation often \\n arises from an inability to control the speech organs. The \\n remedy is daily practice upon the elementary sounds and \\n syllables. \\n \\n As to what constitute* a ^\\'Just articulation\" nothing \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

SI \\n \\n better can be sidd than the oft-quoted words of Austin: \\n \\' \\' The words are not hurried over, nor precipitated syllable \\n over syllable; nor, as it were, melted together into a mass \\n of confusion; they are neither abridged nor prolonged; nor \\n swallowed, nor forced, and, if I may so express myself, \\n shot from mouth to mouth; they are not trailed nor drawled, \\n nor let slip out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They \\n are deliyeied out from the lips as beautiful coins newly \\n issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, per- \\n f ecUy finished, neatly struck by the proper oi^ans, distinct, \\n sharp, in due succession, and of due weight. \" \\n \\n As the impassioned style of oratory peculiar to the old \\n Greeks and Bomans is giving way to the more intellectual \\n and argumentative form of delivery, teachers of the present \\n are giving more attention to ease and precision of speech \\n than did their predecessors. Upon this point Professor \\n Eossell says: \" The appropriate style of modem eloquence \\n is that of intellectual, more than impassioned expression; \\n and enunciation being of all the functions of the voice, \\n that which is most important to the conveyance of thought \\n and meaning, it justly requires, in the course of education, \\n more attention and practice than any other branch of elo- \\n cution. \" \\n \\n EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION. \\n \\n Indistinct and faulty articulation frequently results from \\n an imperfect command of the brain over the muscles \\n involved in speech ; hence one of the greatest benefits to be \\n derived from the persistent practice upon difiScult combina- \\n tions is to establish that intimate connection between the \\n mental powers and the physical organs which will permit no \\n uncert^n utterance. \\n \\n Let the student acquire the power of concentrating his \\n attention upon what he is saying, and the difiSculties of artic- \\n ulation Yrill speedily disappear.

Voice is vocalized breath and as such its for- \\n mation depends upon the method of exhalation employed \\n in phonation and speech. \\n \\n As there are three methods of forcing the air from the \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#56) #################################################\\n\\n54 THE AMERICAN STAR SPEAKER \\n \\n lungs, termed effusive, expulsive and explosive, bo there are \\n thi-ee modes of utterance derived from the manner of \\n expiration. \\n \\n The characteristic too of the Effusive utterance is that \\n of tranquillity, pathos, grandeur and devotion. \\n \\n The Expulnve utterance ranges in use from ordinary \\n description and narration to the highest forms of argumenta- \\n tive discourse. \\n \\n The Explosive utterance is employed in the expression \\n of sudden anger, terror, ectasy and command. \\n \\n No one mode of utterance is likely to be appropriate to \\n an entire composition. The Effusive is rarely found in \\n more than two or three consecutive words. The Expulsive \\n is more common than the others, being employed in the \\n greater part of every conversation. \\n \\n 5UDES. \\n \\n Slides, sometimes termed inflections, are concrete chang- \\n es of pitch, either upward ( /) or downward (\\\\ ) on a single \\n element or word. They vary in extent of elevation or \\n depression according to the nature of the sentiment. \\n \\n The purpose of slides is to convey more accurately those \\n delicate shades of meaning found in abstract reasoning, \\n unemotional description and narration, to give clearness to \\n contrasted ideas and vigor to expressions of earnestness, \\n emotion and passion. \\n \\n No marked degree of excellence in expressive reading may \\n be expected until the student has given much time to the \\n practice and intelligent study of the principles governing \\n voice slides. \\n \\n UPWARD SLIDE. \\n \\n The Upward Slide is an elevation of the voice through \\n the concrete change of pitch, the degree of elevation depend- \\n inij upon the intensity of the thought or emotion. It is em- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#57) #################################################\\n\\nAND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. £5 \\n \\n ployed apon the accented syllables of those words used \\n singly, in phrases or in sentences denoting indifference, un- \\n certainty, incompleteness, daubt, contingency, negation, direct \\n intet rogation, tenderness, pathos, surprise, wonder, anticipa- \\n tion, \\n \\n DOWNWARD SLIDE. \\n \\n The Downward Slide is a downward movement of the \\n voice through concrete change of pitch, the degree of de- \\n pression depending upon the completeness, exactness, or \\n definiteness of the thought in the speaker\\'s mind. It is em- \\n ployed upon those syllables used singly, in phrases or in \\n sentences denoting completeness, determination, certainty, \\n command, passion, positive, and decisive declaration. \\n \\n WAVES. \\n \\n The wave (3) sometimes termed circumflex from the \\n twisting or crooked motion of the tone in passing over the \\n vowels, is a compound movement of voice on a single sylla- \\n ble, word or sentence. \\n \\n The Upward Wave, expressive of eompUtenets, is the \\n union of the Upward and downward Slides; as, ah. The \\n Downward Wave expresses the incompleteness; as, ah. \\n \\n The Upward Single Equal Wave expresses astonishment, \\n admiration. \\n \\n The Downward Single Equal Wave expresses scorn, con- \\n tempt, ridicule, mockery, sneer. \\n \\n The Wave of the Second, employed with a subdued force \\n and low pitch, is used to express dignified admiration, \\n mild contrast, gentle yet all-pervading emotions of reverence \\n and awe, sentiments of beauty, sublimity, grandeur, devotion \\n and adoration. \\n \\n The Wave of the Third is the characteristic wave of \\n playful unt, humor, good natured raillery, mirth, jest, \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#58) #################################################\\n\\nS6 THE yIMERlCMN STAR SPEAKER \\n \\n drollery, insinuation, double meaning, mimicry and strong \\n \\n contrast. \\n \\n PAUSES. \\n \\n Pauses are temporary suspensions of speech between \\n ■words, phrases and clauses, conveying first, the sentimental, \\n second the Emotional, and third the Rhythmical. \\n \\n EMPHASIS, \\n \\n Emphasis is that peculiar utterance of words, phrases and \\n clauses which renders them especially prominent or signifi- \\n cant. Emphasis is effected by a change of quality, force, \\n stress, pitch, slides, waves, movement or quantity, or by \\n lengthening the pauses. Usually two or more of these ele- \\n ments are employed to produce the required emphasis. \\n \\n SLUR. \\n \\n Slur is a smooth, rapid, subdued movement of voice over \\n certain words, phrases and clauses of less importance than \\n others with which they stand associated. It is applied to \\n passages expressing contrast, repetition, explanation, modi- \\n fications, of persons, things, time, place, cause, manner and \\n degree and all parenthetical expression. \\n \\n QUALITY OF VOICE. \\n \\n There are eight qualities of voice commonly recognized \\n by the best readers: Pure Tone, Plaintive, Guttural, Natal, \\n Orotund, Pectoral, Aspirate and Falsetto. \\n \\n PiTEE Tone is a clear, pure, smooth, round, musical \\n tone, the reverberations being confined wholly within the \\n mouth. It is used in the expression of pathos, tenderness, \\n in solemn, serious, tranquil narrative, didactic and descriptive \\n thought, in calling and in joyous and mirthful emotions. \\n \\n The Orotund quality is the Pure Tone deepened and \\n intensified to its utmost magnitp.de, with the resonance m \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#59) #################################################\\n\\n/IND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 67 \\n \\n the chest. It is employed in the expression of emotions of \\n grandeur, sublimit^/, reverence, adoration, devotion, awe. \\n \\n The Plaintive quality sometimes termed the semi-tone, \\n or oral, is that quality of voice whose tones, sliding through \\n a semi-tone or minor third, are uttered in a feeble, trem- \\n bling tone, with the resonance in the forward part of the \\n mouth. It is used to express tenderness, sympathy, pathos, \\n sadness, acute pain, feebleness of old age, grief, entreaty, \\n complaint, exhaustion, languor and affectation. \\n \\n The Pectoral quality is a rough, harsh, hollow tone, \\n with the resonance in the chest, and is used to express \\n dread, sorrow, gloom, despair, grief, deep solemnity mingled \\n with awe, remorse, horror, settled hatred, malice. \\n \\n The Guttural quality (from guttur, throat), is a rough, \\n harsh, grating, rasping, discordant sound produced by a \\n rigid compression of the muscles of the neck and a partial \\n closing of the throat above the glottis, with the resonance \\n in the throat. The quality resembles the growling utter- \\n ances of the lower animals. It is used to express intense \\n anger, hatred, contempt, scorn, disgust, loathing, malice and \\n detestation. \\n \\n The Aspirate quality is articulated breath and ranges \\n from a mere whisper to the least audible tone of the Plain- \\n tive, Pectoral and Guttural qualities. It is used to express \\n secrecy, surprise, impatience, fear, caution, remorse, awe, \\n dread, anger, rage, terror, horror, and expiring life. \\n \\n The Nasal quality (from nasus, the nose), is a harsh, \\n thin twangy tone, with the resonance in the nose. It is \\n used in the mimicry of nasal speakers and in the personation \\n of those suffering from colds and is made by prolonging the \\n syllable ong. \\n \\n The Falsetto quality (ixovufalsus, false), is a screechy, \\n high, shrill tone, pitched above the natural, .with the reso- \\n nance in the head. The Falsetto begins where the pure tone \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#60) #################################################\\n\\n58 THE /IMERICAN ST/IR SPEAKER \\n \\n breaks, or outruns its compass. It ia illustrated hy the \\n sharp, shrill shriek of the owl. Like the Nasal, it is used \\n m mimicry, to denote excitement, irritability, scolding, \\n invective, mockery, sudden fright, cmger, pain, terror and \\n irritable old age. \\n \\n FORCE. \\n \\n Force is the degree of energy, depending upon the inten- \\n sity of feeling with which speech is delivered, and is \\n divided into three classes. Subdued, Moderate and Full, \\n while each may still further be divided into three degrees. \\n \\n Subdued Force is used to express tenderness, pathos, \\n sadness, seriousness, solemnity, reverence, awe, melancholy \\n and tranquillity. \\n \\n Moderate Force is employed in the expression of nar- \\n rative, descriptive and didactic thought, and may be used to \\n express the milder forms of solemnity, sublimity, grandeur \\n and devotion and in introductions to orations. \\n \\n Full Force is eniployed in the expression of strong \\n emotion, a,9 joy, gladness, courage, boldness, defiance, anger, \\n profound sublimity, and grandeur, and is the delivery of \\n political, senatorial and judicial speeclies of an exalted \\n oratorical character. \\n \\n STRESS. \\n \\n Stress is the application of Force to some particular \\n part of a word or syllable. There are six divisions of Stress : \\n Radical Medium Fmal \\n \\n Compound Thorough Intermittent. \\n \\n PITCH, \\n \\n Pitch is the degree of elevation or depression of sound \\n above or below the keynote, and is divided into High, Mid- \\n dle and Low. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#61) #################################################\\n\\n^ND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 59 \\n \\n nOVEMENT. \\n \\n Movement is the degree of rapidity or slowness with \\n which words are uttered in continuous discourse, and is \\n divided into rapid, moderate and slow, with further subdi- \\n visions of very rapid and very slow. \\n \\n MELODY. \\n \\n Melody (Gr. sweet song) is a. succession of pleasing \\n tones having but a limited compass above or below the ini- \\n tial note, with prevailing pitch above the natural. It is one \\n of the most valuable elements the speaker may employ iu \\n attracting and retaining the attention of an audience. The \\n element is employed in those rhythmical compositions, \\n whether prose or poetry, expressing riatJios, tranquil plea»- \\n ure und peaceful repose. \\n \\n ORIGINAL DISCOURSE. \\n \\n Thus far the student has been instructed in the manner \\n only of expressing the thoughts of others. While the ability \\n to comprehend instantly and render effectively an author\\'s \\n thoughts, as outlined upon the printed page, is an accomplish- \\n ment of great value to all, such an attainment is not sufficient \\n for the broad and general culture required by our times and \\n institutions. \\n \\n The responsibilities thrust upon us by the republican \\n form of government under which we live, perpetuated in its \\n purity and efficiency by the logic of a Choate, the wisdom \\n of a Webster and the eloquence of a Clay, demand attain- \\n ments of a higher order than mere skill in the pathetic, for- \\n cible or eloquent repetition of some popular compositions. \\n \\n The citizen who would form at least a unit in the repub- \\n lic must be competent to wield the pen, and, when called \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

His duty to himself and \\n country demand that, whether he write or speak, his perfor- \\n mance should be creditable and effective. \\n \\n A ready, vigorous pen and speech, like reading and dec- \\n lamation, comes from instruction, practice and criticism. \\n \\n EXTEnPORANEOUS SPEECH. \\n \\n The greatest excellence to which the student, ambitious \\n of oratorical fame, may aspire, is comprised in the ability to \\n speak fluently, logically and effectively, upon any subject, at \\n any time, without previous preparation. \\n \\n This accomplishment may be termed \"thinking on one\\'s \\n fe^it. \" It is not the result of any spontaneous development. \\n It X)mes from study, practice, work. \\n \\n The power to charm the heart and steal away the senses, \\n to divert the mind from its own devisings, and hold an audi- \\n ence in breathless spell, as the orator paints the rosy tints \\n of heavenly longings, or leads the imagination down through \\n the labyrinths of wonderland, or depicts with lightning \\n tongue and thunder tones the horrors of the doomed, comes \\n not by nature, but by work — ^work — work. \\n \\n Whether this so-called gift be assisted by the early efforts \\n of a Demosthenes declaiming over the sea-beat cliffs of Attica \\n or the harangues of a youthful Clay before a group of oxen, \\n perfection in delivery is attained only by frequent and long- \\n continued practice, based upon accurate observation and \\n zealous study. \\n \\n THE TWO FORMS OF EXTEHPORANEOUS SPEECH. \\n \\n 1. CONVERSATION. 2. PUBLIC SPEAKING, \\n \\n Conversation is the general and familiar interchange of \\n sentiments. \\n \\n No form of social Intercourse furnishes so much human- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#63) #################################################\\n\\n^ND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 81 \\n \\n jzing enjoyment as pleasing and entertaining conversation. \\n Notwithstanding the pleasure it affords, few people, even \\n among the educated classes, are capable of entertaining a \\n company by continuous intelligent discourse. \\n \\n The student is here reminded that unconnected remarks, \\n followed by ambiguous or meaningless monosyllabic rejoind- \\n ers interspersed with nauseating repetition of such expletives \\n as \"Yes, indeed,\" \"You don\\'t say so,\" \"You bet,\" etc., do \\n not constitute elevating discourse. \\n \\n Conversation is an art, and as such it is capable of culti- \\n vation to approximate perfection. Success in the higher forms \\n of speech depends upon the conversational skill of the aspirant \\n for oratorical honors. \\n \\n GENERAL RULES FOR CONVERSATION. \\n \\n {Bead the Introduction to this book.) \\n \\n Breathe without gasping or attracting attention. \\n \\n Articulate distinctly, but do not impress your hearers \\n with the idea that you are going through an exercise in vocal \\n gymnastics. \\n \\n Be natural; remember it is yourself you are impersonat- \\n ing, and you will be judged accordingly. \\n \\n In general, use a full, pure tone, moderate force, rad- \\n ical stress, middle pitch, and moderate movement. In those \\n parts of your conversation requiring peculiar description and \\n personation, use the appropriate elements. \\n \\n Enter into the spirit of the subject with all your mind. \\n Cultivate the habit of listening to others. This is at least \\n polite. Attention to what others say is the relay from \\n which you are enabled to continue your part of the conver- \\n sation intelligibly and agreeably to the other members of \\n your company. \\n \\n Avoid pedantry, affectation, and all mannerisms calcu- \\n lated to detract from the general topic of conversation. \\n \\n Conceive, summon, and express your best thoughts. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#64) #################################################\\n\\n68 THE AMERICAN STAR SPEAKER \\n \\n Employ the simplest, purest and most expressive lan- \\n guage at your command. \\n \\n Avoid unpleasant personalities particularly with refer- \\n ence to those who are absent \\n \\n Avoid topics of little general interest to your listeners . \\n \\n However familiar to the company the condition of the \\n weather and streets may be, their prolonged discussion is \\n not BufiBciently important to justify more than a passing \\n remark. \\n \\n Indulge sparingly in raillery and cutting repartee.

RULES FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING. \\n \\n Public extemporaneous speaking is the delivery of senti- \\n ment without previous written preparation. \\n \\n The speaker employs the same elements as in conversa- \\n tion, but upon an enlarged scale. To these he may, as \\n occasion requires, add depth and fullness to his quality, \\n producing the grand tones of the Orotund; he may increase \\n his force, raise his pitch, and indulge in a greater variety of \\n stress, movement, and pauses than in ordinary conversation. \\n In addition to these departures he may Energize and embel- \\n lish his delivery by gesture and facial expression; and, \\n generally, he may play upon the accidental elements in \\n arousing the emotions of an audience more than would be \\n proper in the most animated conversation. \\n \\n Of all professions recognized by civilized man, probably \\n none requires in its perfection so many and varied accom- \\n plishments as that of oratory. The public lecturer who leads \\n the van in the march of science for the improvement of \\n society, the statesman, who guards the nation\\'s rights and \\n shapes his country\\'s destiny, the man of God, who seeks to \\n purify the human heart and save a fallen race — all must \\n wield the wondrous power of speech. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

To this end he should have frequent practice \\n in readmg, conversation, speaking and writing. \\n \\n SPECIFIC RULES FOR EXTEMPORANEOUS SPBAKINa. \\n \\n Have something to say worth hearing. \\n \\n Believe and feel intensely all you say. \\n \\n Be wide awake and thoroughly in earnest. \\n \\n Merge yourself into the thoughts you are littering. \\n \\n Look into the eyes of your hearers, not over their heads. \\n \\n Know more of the subject than do any of your auditors. \\n \\n Beyonrself; you cannot personate another with your ideas. \\n \\n Endeavor to hold your hearers that they may not wander \\n from the subject. \\n \\n Avoid all forms of slang; no speaker ever exhausted the \\n English language. \\n \\n If you have five or ten minutes for preparation, think of \\n the proposition only. \\n \\n Cultivate facility and elegance of expression by using \\n good language at all times. \\n \\n Never lose control of your thoughts, your breath, your \\n speech or your temper. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#66) #################################################\\n\\n64 THE /IMERIC/IN STAR SPEAKER \\n \\n Maintain a constant reserve; the orator mast appear \\n greater than his theme or his effort. \\n \\n Think only of what you are going to say; your grammar, \\n rhetoric and elocution will suggest the manner. \\n \\n Keep the voice and speech organs moist, not hy drink, \\n but by chewing a bit of paper just before using the voice. \\n \\n Have a complete mastery of all the elements of elocu- \\n tion; thus your body and limbs are made Bubjective to the \\n mental powers. \\n \\n Hold yourself flexibly erect with an active chest. The \\n weight should be supported mainly on the balls of the feet, \\n not the heels. \\n \\n Command a faultless articulation, an accurate pronunci- \\n ation and an absolute control of the essential elements of \\n vocal expression. \\n \\n Carefully study the speeches of eminent orators known \\n to be extemporaneous; consider the time, place and circum- \\n stances of their delivery. \\n \\n Study the models furnished by Demosthenes, Cicero, \\n Fox, Sheridan, Burke, Webster and Clay, and modern ora- \\n tors of recognized ability. \\n \\n In passing from one sentiment or emotion to another, \\n strive to feel the emotion before attempting its utterance ; \\n words without feeling awake no responsive chord among \\n your hearers. \\n \\n Avoid great force in the beginning by studied distinct- \\n ness and deliberate movement. Your audience must be led \\n by measured tones of persuasion gradually up to the more \\n Intensified forms of expression. \\n \\n Commit and frequently recite aloud a few excellent pas- \\n sages abounding in decided sentiment, absorbing emotion \\n and vehement passion. The possession of the words gives \\n the mind opportunity to dwell upon the thoughts, and thus \\n their frequent conception and utterance trains the nerves), \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Stop the moment yov, are done. \\n \\n SPEAKING FROM NOTES. \\n \\n When the speaker has sufQcient time to collect and arrange \\n his thoughts he shonld endeavor to think of all he wishes to \\n say upon the subject, and write the beads of his thoughts as \\n they occur, and afterward arrange them in the most appro- \\n priate order. \\n \\n In general, the imost pleasing and entertaining matter \\n should appear first. The auditors are never so critical as \\n whei. the speaker steps upon the platform. An unfavor- \\n able impression once made is too difficult to overcome to \\n justify the speaker\\'s giving it an occasion. \\n \\n The closing thoughts should possess merit and original, \\n ity, and should be spoken with such sincerity, vigor and \\n eloquence that an andience shall respect at least the advo- \\n cate, if not the sentiment he utters. \\n \\n Do not be tedious. Do not labor to exhaust your theme. \\n When you can no longer talk without stopping to think what \\n next to say, you are done and should stop at once. \\n \\n (Bead \"The Power of Speech\" on page 18.) \\n \\n METHOD OF CRITICISM. \\n \\n The following plan of estimating the merits of a speaker\\'s \\n performance, introduced into a number of literary societies \\n by the late Professor I. H. Brown, is recommended. It will \\n prove valuable to critics of literary societies. The table \\n should be prepared on printed sheets and the name of the \\n performer written in the blank, with the proper answer \\n placed after each question. This sheet, so prepared by the \\n critic and given to the performer, would aflford the latter \\n much greater benefit than is conferred by the usual imper. \\n feet system of criticisms. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Mr. Lyte was \\n advised to go for a time to the south of France, in the hope that a wanner climate \\n would strengthen his failing health. Before leaving England he wished once \\n more to preach to his people. His family feared what the result of such an effort \\n might be, but he gently insisted, and was able to go through with the service. \\n He knew that he was preaching for the last time, and his sermon was full of \\n solemn and tender appeals to those whom he had guided and instructed for many \\n years. At the end of the service he retired, exhausted in body, but with his \\n soul sweetly resting on that Savior whom he had preached with his dying breath. \\n As the evening drew on he handed to a member of his family the following \\n hymn, which he had just written. This was his last hymn on earth. He \\n reached Nice, and shortly after his spirit entered into rest. He pointed upward \\n as he i)aEsed away, and whispered, \"Peace, joy!\" Thus he went to, abide for- \\n ever with Him who has declared it X(y be His divine will that His followers be- \\n with Him where He is, that they may behold His glory. \\n \\n Abide with me ; fast falls the eventide ; \\n The darkness deepens ; Lord, with me abide ! \\n When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, \\n Help of the helpless, O abide with me! \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Capt. Nathan Hale, but twen- \\n ty-one years old, Toluntered to procure the informajtion. \\n He was taken, and hanged as a spy the day after his capture, \\n Sept. 22, 1776. His patriotic devotion and brutal treatment \\n received at the hands c£ his captors \\'ave suggested the \\n following: \\n \\n \\'Twas in the year that gave the Nation birth — \\n A time when men esteemed the common good \\n As greater weal than private gain. A battle fierce \\n And obstinate had laid a. thousand patriots low, \\n And filled the people\\'s hearts ^ith gloom. \\n \\n Pursued like hunted deer, , \\n The crippled army fled; and, yet, amid \\n Disaster and defeat, the Nation\\'s chosen chief \\n Besolved his losses to retrieve. But not \\n With armies disciplined and trained by years \\n Of martial service could he, this Fabian chief, \\n Now hope to check the hosts of Howe\\'s victorious legions — \\n These had he not. \\n \\n In stratagem the shrewder general \\n Ofttimes o\\'ercomes his strong antagonist. \\n To Washington, a knowledge of the plans, \\n Position, strength of England\\'s force. \\n Must compensate for lack of numbers. \\n \\n He casts about for one who\\'d take his life \\n In hand. , Lol he stands before the chief.

He generally selected \\n such chapters as contained a number of ticklish points so \\n that his marvelous powers of eloocidation might be \\n brought into play. On this occasion he had chosen one \\n that fairly bristled with difficulties. It was the chapter \\n describing Samson as catching three hundred foxes, tying \\n them tail to tail, setting fire brands in their midst and \\n starting them among the standing corn of the Philistines. \\n As he closed the description he shut the book and com- \\n menced to eloocidate as follows : \\n \\n \"My dear freends, I dare say you have been wondering \\n in your minds how it was possible that Samson could \\n catch three hundred foxes. You or me couldna catch \\n one fox, let alone three hundred — ^the beasts run so fast. \\n But lo! and behold! here we have one single man \\'all by, \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

That\\'s the pint; and at first sight it looks \\n a very ticklish pint; but it\\'s not so ticklish as it looks, \\n my freends ; and if you give me your undivided attention \\n for a few minutes, I\\'ll clear away the whole difficulty and \\n make what now seems dark and incomprehensible to your \\n uninstructed minds, as clear as the sun in its noonday \\n meridian. \\n \\n \"Well, then, we are told in the Scriptures that Samson \\n was the strongest man that ever lived ; and, furthermore, \\n we are told in the chapter next after the one we have \\n been reading, that he was a very polite man ; for when \\n he was at the house of Dagon he bowed with all his might, \\n and if some as you, my freends, would only bow with \\n half your might it would be better for you. But, al- \\n though we are told all this, we are not told that he was a \\n great runner. But if he catched three hundred foxes, \\n he must have been a great runner. But, my dear freends, \\n here\\'s the eloocidation o\\' the matter. Ye\\'ll please bear \\n this in mind, that although we are not told he was the \\n greatest runner, still we\\'re not told he was\\'na, and, there- \\n fore, I contend that we have a perfect right to assume, \\n by all the logic and scientific history, that he was the \\n fastest runner that ever was born ; and this was how he \\n catched the three hundred foxes. \\n \\n \"But after we get rid of this difficulty, my freends, \\n another crops up— how in the world did he tie their tails \\n together? We all know that foxes\\' tails are not long \\n enough for this operation ; how, then, was Samson able \\n to tie them all?

He was but \\n half dressed ; though his legs were concealed in long mili- \\n tary boots.. An aged minister stood beside the rough \\n couch. The form was that of a strong man grown old \\n through care more than age. There was a face that you \\n might look upon but once, and yet wear it in your mem- \\n ory forever. \\n \\n Let us bend over the bed, and look upon that face. A \\n bold forehead seamed by one deep wrinkle visible between \\n the brows — long locks of dark hair, sprinkled with gray ; \\n lips firmly set, yet quivering, as though they had a life \\n separate from the life of the man; and then, two large \\n eyes — ^vivid, burning, unnatural in their steady glare. \\n Ay, there was something terrible in that face — something: \\n so full of unnatural loneliness — unspeakable despair, that \\n the aged minister started back in horror. But look ! those \\n strong arms are clutching at the vacant air; the death- \\n sweat stands in drops on that bold brow — the man is \\n dying.

Then, with the strong agony of death \\n upon him, he rose into a sitting posture. For the first \\n time he spoke. \"Christian !\" he echoed in that deep tone \\n which thrilled the preacher to the heart. \"Will that faith \\n give me back my honor? Come with me, old man, come \\n with me, far over the waters. Ha ! we are there ! This \\n is my native town. Yonder is the church in which I \\n knelt in my childhood; yonder the green on which I \\n sported when a boy.

The \\n graves in yonder churchyard would shrink from my foot- \\n steps; and yonder flag would rain a baptism of blood \\n upon my head !\" \\n \\n That was an awful death-bed. The minister had \\n watched \"the last night\" with a hundred convicts in their \\n cells, but ha.d never beheld a scene so terrible as this. \\n Suddenly the dying man arose; he tottered along the \\n floor. With those white fingers, whose nails were blue \\n with the death-chill, he threw open a valise. He drew \\n from thence a faded coat of blue, faced with silver, and \\n the wreck of a battle-flag. \\n \\n \"Look ye, priest! this faded coat is spotted with my \\n blood !\" he cried, as old memories seemed stirring in his \\n heart. \"This coat I wore, when I first heard the news of \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Horatio Gates stood \\n before his tent, gazing steadfastly upon the two armies, \\n now arrayed in order of battle. It was a clear, bracing \\n day, mellow with the richness of Autumn. The sky was \\n cloudless; the foliage of the woods scarce tinged with \\n purple and gold ; the Buckwheat in yonder fields frostened \\n into snowy ripeness. But the tread of legions shook the \\n ground; from every bush shot the glimmer of the rifle \\n barrel; on every hill-side blazed the sharpened bayonet. \\n Gates was sad and thoughtful, as he watched the evolu- \\n tions of the two armies. But all at once a smoke arose, \\n a thunder shook the ground, and a chorus of shouts and \\n groans yelled along the darkened air. The play of \\n death had begun. The two flags, this of the stars, that \\n of the red cross, tossed amid the smoke of battle, while \\n the sky was clouded with leaden folds, and the earth \\n throbbed with the pulsations of a mighty heart. \\n \\n Suddenly Gates and his olificers were startled. Along \\n the height on which they stood came a rider, upon a black \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

There was \\n something in the appearance of this horse and his rider \\n that struck them with surprise. Look, he draws his \\n sword, the sharp blade quivers through the air — he points \\n to the distant battle, and lo! he is gone; gone through \\n those clouds, while his shout echoes over the plains. \\n Wherever the fight is thickest, there, through intervals \\n of cannon smoke, you may see riding madly forward the \\n strange soldier, mounted on his steed, black as death. \\n Look at him, as with face red with , British blood he \\n waves his sword and shouts to his legions! Now you \\n may see him fighting in that cannon\\'s glare, and the next \\n moment he is away off yonder, leading the forlorn hope \\n up that steep cliff. Is it not a magnificent sight, to see \\n that strange soldier and that noble black horse dashing, \\n like a meteor, down the long columns of battle ? Let us \\n look for a moment into those clouds of battle. Over this \\n thick hedge bursts a band of American militia-men, their \\n rude farmer coats stained with blood, while, scattering \\n their arms by the way, they flee before that company of \\n red-coat hirelings, who come rushing forward, their solid \\n front of bayonets gleaming in the battle light. In this \\n moment of their flight a horse comes crashing over the \\n plains. The unknown rider reins his steed back on his \\n haunches, right in the path of the broad-shouldered \\n militia-men. \\n \\n \"Now, cowards : Advance another step, and I\\'ll strike \\n you to the heart !\" shouts the unknown, extending a pistol \\n in either hand. \"What! Are you Americans, men, and \\n fly before British soldiers? Back again, and face them \\n once more, or I myself will ride you down !\" \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

The British advance. \"Now, \\n upon the rebels! charge!\" shouts the red-coat officer. \\n They spring forward at the same bound. Look! their \\n bayonets almost touch the muzzles of their rifles. At \\n this moment the voice of the unknown rider was heard: \\n \"Now let them have it! Fire!\" A sound is heard, a \\n smoke is seen, twenty Britons are down, some writhing \\n in death, some crawling along the soil, and some speech- \\n less as stone. The remaining ten start back. \"Club your \\n rifles and charge them home !\" shouts the unknown. The \\n black horse springs forward, followed by the militia- \\n men. Then a confused conflict — a cry for quarter, and \\n a vision of twenty farmers grouped around the rider of \\n the black horse, greeting him with cheers. Thus it was \\n all the day long. Wherever that black horse and his \\n rider went, there followed victory. At last, toward the \\n setting of the sun, the crisis of the conflict came. That \\n fortress yonder, on Bemus\\' Heights, must be won, or the \\n American cause is lost! That cliff is too steep — ^there \\n death is too certain. The officers cannot persuade the \\n men to advance. The Americans have lost the field. \\n Even Morgan, that iron man among iron men, leans on \\n his rifle and despairs of the field. But look yonder : In this \\n moment, when all is dismay and horror, here, crashing on, \\n comes the black horse and rider.

Now, red-coat hirelings, shout \\n your battle-cry, if you can ; for look : there, in the gates \\n of the fortress, as the smoke clears away, stands the black \\n horse and his rider. That steed falls dead, pierced by \\n a hundred balls ; but his rider, as the British cry for quar- \\n ter, lifts up his voice, and shouts afar to Horatio Gates, \\n waiting yonder in his tent, \"Saratoga is won!\" As that \\n cry goes up to heaven he falls with his leg shattered by \\n a cannon ball. \\n \\n Who was the rider of the black horse? Do you not \\n guess his name ? Then bend down and gaze on that shat- \\n tered limb, and you will see that it bears the mark of a \\n former wound.

Soumet said : \"This \\n young boy has given new hopes to our literature.\" The \\n great Chateaubriand said : \"This boy has writteti things \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

He had marked out for himself a career more \\n glorious than Bossuets and more enduring than Vol- \\n taire\\'s. \\n \\n Poetry claimed his attention almost from childhood. \\n In it his political opinions found expression. These were \\n an echo of Voltaire\\'s ; the throne without the altar. The \\n beautiful boy, wrapped up in his devotion to the royalism \\n of Voltaire, never dreamed that one day he should eman- \\n cipate fiction, revolutionize the drama, and fill France with \\n republican ideas destined to overthrow a throne and \\n dynasty. \\n \\n At twenty-three, regenerated in religion and politics, \\n resolute in purpose and sanguine of success, Victor Hugo \\n began his great mission. He published his novel \"Han \\n d\\'Islande,\" and French literature was liberated from the \\n thralldom of Aristotle. He wrote \"Cromwell,\" and the \\n independence of the theater was achieved. \"Marion de \\n Lorme\" had only to appear, and royalty stood before the \\n world humiliated. The suppression of this play by the \\n government only rendered his next more popular. \"Her- \\n nani\" was the last of a series of steps up which France \\n was climbing to the revolution of \\'30. \\n \\n In the events of \\'48 the dream of his lifetime was \\n almost realized. Out of the chaos and ruin of revolution \\n arose the Republic, grand and symmetrical. But this \\n could not long remain.

The \\n nephew of the Corsican ascends the throne of the Empire, \\n and the barricade of the Faubourg St. Antoine becomes \\n for Hugo the \"barricade of the exile.\" \\n \\n Years rolled by. The \"old man of Guernsey\" had \\n almost relinquished his dream. Suddenly from his sea- \\n girt home he hears the tramp of Prussian soldiery, and \\n catches the gleam of French bayonets. Woerth, Beau- \\n mont, Gravelot and Sedan follow in quick, splendid suc- \\n cession. The fall of the shattered Empire snaps the bonds \\n of the exile ; and once more a freeman, Victor Hugo sets \\n his foot on the soil of republican France. \\n \\n Whatever progress France has made is due to ideas \\n of which Victor Hugo was a brilliant advocate ; but his \\n name in the political history of his country is — ^Dreamer. \\n He believed in the Republic ; but it was an ideal Republic \\n — an impossible Republic, without ignorance, without \\n vice, universal in limit, unrestrained in liberty. \\n \\n As a writer Victor Hugo has won his title to the \\n world\\'s remembrance. He must ever stand among the \\n great poets and novelists of France. Though we may not \\n share his fancies, let us ever regard with gratitude him \\n whose trials and triumphs will live forever in Les Mis- \\n erables. \\n \\n IMAGINATION, A MEANS OF NAPOLEON\\'S \\n SUCCESS. \\n \\n There is a natural tendency among men, when they \\n meet the word \"imagination,\" to give to it a meaning \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#462) ################################################\\n\\n370 PROSE SELECTIONS. \\n \\n which places it among the gew-gaws of the intellect. But \\n this is far from its true meaning. It is not an article for \\n dreaming, fanciful men only to deal with. It is as much \\n the property of men of the world as of men of letters ; \\n as much the property of the soldier as of the poet. It \\n is the motive power of the whole machinery of the mind ; \\n the origin of our endeavors; the prompter of our suc- \\n cess. \\n \\n History teems with instances of imaginatioft deter- \\n mining the success of great men ; but among them all is \\n no better illustration of it than the case of Napoleon. He \\n was accustomed, before his battles, to appeal to the imagi- \\n nation of his soldiers. On the eve of one of his battles, \\n under the shadow of the Pyramids, he said : \"Soldiers, \\n from yonder pile thirty centuries look down upon you !\" \\n No more was needed. The imagination of the French \\n soldiers saw the spirits of the great Egyptian dead encir- \\n cling the summits of the gigantic monuments of their \\n skill. The French soldier was fighting on the battle- \\n field of nations who, centuries before, had passed away; \\n and, if fall he must, the plains of the Pharaohs should be \\n his grave, and Egypt\\'s pyramids his monument. His \\n imagination was the source of his endeavors ; and its in- \\n fluence upon the imagination of others promoted his \\n progress and insured his success. He stepped upon the \\n stage of action when the world was waiting breathlessly \\n for a prominent actor in the tragedy then being enacted \\n in France. Springing from lowly origin, his rapid rise \\n and continued success dazzled the imagination of both \\n actor and spectators. His mind, strong and active, was \\n the basis.

SH \\n \\n sunligfit pouring through stained windows, and tinting \\n •with a thousand hues the space within, so imagination \\n penetrated and colored all the deeds of Napoleon. Nature \\n made him a poet ; but he preferred to act rather than to \\n write a poem. His life was a grand epic ; and its music, \\n slow and solenuij was chanted in the roar and din of \\n battle in strains above the praise of critics. From Auster- \\n litz, Jena, Lody and Wagram the whole world heard; \\n and when its mournful cadence marked the slow falling \\n of the curtain upon the closing scene at Waterloo, the \\n nations shuddered. \\n \\n \\'Twas then the \"harp the monarch minstrel swept\" \\n was hushed. Its chords had broken one by one. That \\n harp, whose tumultuous strains had charmed the world, \\n and brought kings trembling at his feet, was shattered. \\n Upon that field the brightest light of France went out; \\n earth\\'s mightiest poet fell. \\n \\n THE POWER OF WORDS. \\n \\n Words are most effective when arranged in that order \\n which is called style. The great secret of a good style, we \\n are told, is to have proper words in proper places. To \\n marshal one\\'s verbal battalions in such order that they \\n must bear at once upon all quarters of a subject is cer- \\n tanily a great art. This is done in different ways. Swift. \\n Temple, Addison, Hume, Gibbon, Johnson, Burke, are \\n all great generals in the discipline of their verbal armies, \\n and the conduct of their paper wars. Each has a system \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#466) ################################################\\n\\n372 PROSE SELECTIONS. \\n \\n of tactics of his own^ and excels in the use of some par- \\n ticular weapon. \\n \\n The tread of Johnson\\'s style is heavy and sonorous, \\n resembling that of an elephant or a mail-clad warrior. He \\n is fond of leveling an obstacle by a polysyllabic battering- \\n ram. Burke\\'s words are continually practicing the broad- \\n sword exercise, and sweeping down adversaries with \\n every stroke. Arbuthnot \"plays his weapons like a tongue \\n of flame.\" Addison draws up his light infantry in orderly \\n array, and marches through sentence after sentence with- \\n out having his ranks disordered or his line broken. \\n \\n Luther is different. His words are \"half battle\"; \"his \\n smiting idiomatic phrases seem to cleave into the very \\n secret of the matter.\" Gibbon\\'s legions are heavily armed, \\n and march with precision and dignity to the music of \\n their own tramp. They are splendidly equipped, but a \\n nice eye can discern a little rust beneath their fine apparel, \\n and there are suttlers in his camp who lie, cog, and talk \\n gross obscenity. Macaulay, brisk, lively, keen, and ener- \\n getic, runs his thoughts rapidly through his sentence, and \\n kicks out of the way every word which obstructs his \\n passage. He reins in his steed only when he has reached \\n his goal, and then does it with such celerity that he is \\n nearly thrown backward by the suddenness of his stop- \\n page. \\n \\n Gifford\\'s words are moss-troopers, that waylay inno- \\n cent travelers and murder them for hire. Jeffrey is a \\n fine \"lance,\" with a sort of Arab swiftness in his move- \\n ment, and runs an iron-clad horseman through the eye \\n before he has had time to close his helmet.

All \\n of Ebenezer Elliot\\'s words are gifted with huge fists to \\n pummel and bruise. Chatham and Mirabeau throw hot \\n shot into their opponents\\' magazines. Talfourd\\'s forces \\n are orderly and disciplined, and march to the music of \\n the Dorian flute; those of Keats keep time to the tones \\n of the pipe of Plioebus ; and the hard, harshfeatured bat- \\n talions of Maginn are always preceded by a brass band. \\n Hallam\\'s word-infantry can do much execution, when \\n they are not in each other\\'s way. Pope\\'s phrases are \\n either daggers or rapiers. \\n \\n Willis\\' words are often tipsy with the champagne of \\n the fancy, but even when they reel and stagger, they keep \\n the line of grace and beauty, and though scattered at first \\n by a fierce onset from graver cohorts, soon reunite without \\n wound or loss. John Neal\\'s forces are multitudinous, and \\n fire briskly at everything. They occupy all the provinces \\n of letters, and are nearly useless from being spread over \\n too much ground. Everett\\'s weapons are ever kept in \\n good order, and shine well in the sun, but they are little \\n calculated for warfare, and rarely kill when they strike. \\n Webster\\'s words are thunderbolts, which sometimes miss \\n -the Titans at whom they are hurled, but always leave \\n enduring marks when they strike. \\n \\n Hazlitt\\'s verbal army is sometimes drunk and surly. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Some of Tom Moore\\'s words are shining dirt, \\n which he flings with excellent aim. This list might be \\n indefinitely extended, and arranged with more regard to \\n merit and chronology. My own words, in this connection, \\n might be compared to ragged, undisciplined militia, which \\n could be easily routed by a charge of horse, and which are \\n apt to fire into each other\\'s faces. — E. P. Whipple, \\n \\n SOCIETY THE GREAT EDUCATOR. \\n \\n Society is the great educator. More than universities, \\n more than schools, more than books, society educates. \\n Nature is the schoolhouse, and many lessons are written \\n upon its walls ; but man is the effective teacher. Parents, \\n relatives, friends, associates ; social manner, maxims, mor- \\n als, worships, the daily example, the fireside conversa- \\n tion, the casual interview, the spirit that breathes through \\n the whole atmosphere of life — these are the powers .ind \\n influences that train the mass of mankind. Even books, \\n which are daily assuming a larger place in human train- \\n ing, are but the influence of man on man. \\n \\n It is evident that one of the leading and ordained \\n means by which men are raised in the scale of knowledge \\n and virtue is the conversation, example, influence of men \\n superior to themselves.

But then, much of \\n their intercourse is on terms of inequality. Equals in \\n age, people in society, seldom meet, but one is able to \\n teach or tell something, and the other is desirous to learn \\n it. The lower are strongly drawn to the higher. Chil- \\n dren are not content to be always by themselves ; curiosity, \\n reverence, filial affection draw them to their superiors. \\n In the whole business of life — ^tillage, mechanism, manu- \\n facture, merchandise — a younger generation is connected \\n with an elder, to be taught by it. \\n \\n Barbarous tribes go on forever in their barbarism, till \\n they are brought into the presence of superior culture. \\n The Chinese exclusion has kept that people stationary, \\n though civilization has been knocking at their gates for \\n more than three centuries. And it is better — I speak of \\n mere results, not principles — ^that the way for light should \\n be opened into that country by cannon balls, or the rend- \\n ing asunder of the empire, than never to be opened. \\n \\n But such a fixed barrier to civilization is a solitary \\n phenomenon in history. Nations, the barbarous and civil- \\n ized, by some means or other, in the everlasting ferment \\n of human interests and passions, and thrown into com- \\n munication and iterfusion — if by no better means, by war, \\n by subjugation, by capture: for Providence, if one may \\n say so, will have them come together. Human injustice \\n and cruelty are not to be abetted in this matter.

Locke was thought to have demonstrated, by un- \\n answerable argument, our entire lack of innate ideas, \\n thus demolishing the foundation upon which others had \\n erected so many and such various theories. But now \\n Kant has proven, by a logic far more subtle, and alto- \\n gether more conclusive, that the mind acts only in cer- \\n tain processes, or by means of certain categories, \\n which are the laws of its organization, and whence \\n result conceptions or ideas not derived from expe- \\n rience, or observation, or confidence in others. Plato \\n arrived at the same conclusion two thousand years ago, \\n although he supposed these conceptions or ideas to be \\n the reminiscences of a former and superior state of in- \\n tellectual existence. What has Kant accomplished, in all \\n his philosophy, except our remission to the speculations \\n of Plato, as enforced and illustrated by the wisdom of \\n revealed religion?

BAILEY. \\n \\n The most exquisite article of domestic torture is the \\n modern window-curtain fixture. Years ago, before the \\n desecrating hand of inventive genius was reared, the \\n window covering was either a green shade hung by \\n hooks, or a simple piece of muslin nailed firmly to the \\n upper casing. Now the curtain is uniformly of cloth, \\n with a flat stick at the bottom and a round stick at the \\n top and a complicated lot of brass cogs and ratchets \\n at the ends. \\n \\n It isn\\'t much trouble to fit in the flat stick, because \\n that can be measured the right length on the floor, but \\n it is getting the proper length of the round sticks or \\n rollers that plays the mischief with a man\\'s temper. \\n We are not quite certain but that it could be done \\n without much bluster were a man\\'s wife to go oflf toi \\n the other end of town and stay there until the opera- \\n tion is over. She doesn\\'t, however. She keeps right \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

This is partly because the man has then more time, \\n and partly attributable to his desire to put off the evil \\n job until the last moment. The first thing to be done \\n is to separate the parcels and borrow a saw. Every \\n family keeps its own screw-driver (point broken) and \\n hammer (handle loose). \\n \\n You instinctively saw the flat pieces first, becaUBe \\n that is the easiest, and afterward fit the rollers, which \\n is more difficult. Then the curtain is tacked to the \\n roller, which keeps turning over and breaking the tacks, \\n and catching your fingers under the hammer. This done, \\n you are ready to plant your feet on the best cane-bottom \\n chair in the house and put up the fixtures. Here your \\n wife says: \"Well, if I ever saw anything quite so idi- \\n otic as .\" You then get right down, when she starts \\n \\n for a wooden article, and by way of showing that you \\n have no feeling in the matter, you kick the cane-seat \\n into the middle of the room. \\n \\n Once mounted on the wooden chair, the brackets are \\n put up. To do this requires that you extend your arms \\n the full length, and while in this condition, with a couple \\n of screws and a screw-driver in your mouth, the hammer \\n in one hand, the other hanging to the fixtures, and the \\n curtain with the unwieldy roller across your shoulder, \\n you make the sickening discovery that you have got noth- \\n ing with which to punch the hole for the screw. Then \\n you get down to the floor again to remedy the defect. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#495) ################################################\\n\\niPROSE SELECTIONS. 401 \\n \\n and find there is nothing for that purpose but the advice \\n of your wife to drive the screw till it sets. You mount \\n again. She holds the lamp so she can see if the woman \\n has cleaned the comers of the glass, and as you have \\n your mouth too full of hardware to articulate with any \\n freedom, you find yourself obliged to kick her elbow to \\n indicate that you actually demand some of the flame \\n to set the screw. The artifice is lost upon her, however, \\n for, likely as not, she will set down the lamp to rub her \\n arm, and ask you what you mean. \\n \\n No one has yet set a bracket to a curtain fixture with- \\n out either dropping some of the implements or a remark \\n well calculated to engross the attention of the party hold- \\n ing the lamp.

IngersoU\\'s oration on Roscoe Conkling.] \\n \\n Fortunate is that nation great enough to know the \\n great. When a great man dies — one who has nobly fought \\n the battle of life, who has been faithful to every trust, \\n and has uttered his highest, noblest thoughts — one who \\n has stood proudly by the right in spite of jeer and taunt, \\n neither stopped by foe nor swerved by friend, in honor- \\n ing him, in speaking words of praise and love above his \\n dust, we pay a tribute to ourselves. \\n \\n How poor this world would be without its graves, \\n without the memories of its mighty dead. Only the \\n voiceless speak forever. \\n \\n Intelligence, integrity, and courage are the great pil- \\n lars that support the State. \\n \\n Above all, the citizens of a free nation should honor \\n the brave and independent man — ^the man of stainless \\n integrity, of will, and intellectual force. Such men are \\n the Atlases on whose mighty shoulders rest the great \\n fabric of the Republic. Flatterers, cringers, crawlers, \\n time-servers, are the dangerous citizens of a democracy. \\n They who gain applause and power by pandering to the \\n mistakes, the prejudices and passions of the multitude \\n are the enemies of liberty. \\n \\n When the intelligent submit to the clamor of the many \\n anarchy begins, and the republic reaches the edge of \\n chaos. Mediocrity, touched with ambition, flatters the \\n base and calumniates the great, while the true patriot, \\n who will do neither, is often sacrificed. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

The found- \\n ers of America and their descendants have accomplished \\n more and better things. On the basis of a rapid geo- \\n graphical extension, and with the force of teeming num- \\n bers, they have, in the very infancy of their political \\n existence, successfully aimed at higher progress in a \\n generous civilization. The mechanical arts have been \\n cultivated with unusual aptitude. Agriculture, manufac- \\n tures, commerce, navigation, whether by sails or by steam, \\n and the art of printing in all its forms, have been pur- \\n sued with surprising skill. Great improvements have \\n been made in all those branches of industry, and in the \\n machinery pertaining to them, which have been eagerly \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#499) ################################################\\n\\nPROSE SELECTIONS. 405 \\n \\n adopted in Europe. A more adequate provision has \\n been made for popular education than in almost any \\n other country. There are more seminaries in the United \\n States, where a respectable academical education may be \\n obtained — ^more, I still mean, in proportion to the popu- \\n lation — ^than in any other country except Germany. The \\n fine arts have reached a high degree of excellence. The \\n taste for music is rapidly spreading in town and country ; \\n and every year witnesses productions from the pencil and \\n the chisel of American sculptors and painters, which \\n would adorn any gallery in the world. Our Astrono- \\n mers, Mathematicians, Naturalists, Chemists, Engineers, \\n Jurists, Publicists, Historians, Poets, Novelists, and Lexi- \\n cographers, have placed themselves on a level with those \\n of the elder world. The best dictionaries of the English \\n language since Johnson are those published in America. \\n Our constitutions, whether of the United States or of \\n the separate States, exclude all public provision for the \\n maintenance of religion. Hut in no part of Christendom \\n is it more generously supported. Sacred science is pur- \\n sued as diligently and the pulpit commands as high a \\n degree of respect in the United States as in those coun- \\n tries where the Church is publicly endowed; while the \\n American Missionary operations have won the admira- \\n tion of the civilized world. Nowhere, I am persuaded, \\n are there more liberal contributions to public-spii-ited and \\n charitable objects. In a word, there is no branch of the \\n mechanical or fine arts, no department of science, exact \\n or applied, no form of polite literature, no description \\n of social improvement, in which, due allowance being \\n made for the means and resources at command, the prog- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

In the factories of Europe there is machinery \\n of American invention or improvement ; in their observa- \\n tories telescopes of American construction, and apparatus \\n of American invention for recording the celestial phe- \\n nomena. America contests with Europe the introductions \\n into actual use of the electric telegraph, and her mode of \\n operating it is adopted throughout the French empire. \\n American authors in almost every department are found \\n on the shelves of European libraries. It is true no Ameri- \\n can Homer, Virgil, Dante, Copernicus, Shakespeare, Ba- \\n con, Milton, Newton, has risen on the world. These \\n mighty geniuses seem to be exceptions in the history of \\n the human mind. Favorable circumstances do not pro- \\n duce them, nor does the absence of favorable circum- \\n stances prevent their appearance. Homer rose in the \\n dawn of Grecian culture; Virgil flourished in the court \\n of Augustus; Dante ushered in the birth of the new \\n European civilization; Copernicus was reared in a Polish i \\n cloister; Shakespeare was trained in the green-room of \\n the theater; Milton was formed while the elements of \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

If we have to take it, it \\n is our business with Providence. If we must save Mexico, \\n and make its weakness our strength, we have no account \\n to render unto Europe or its dynasties. \\n \\n If European Powers choose to expand their empire \\n and energize their people, we have no protests, no arms \\n to prevent them. England may push from India through \\n the Himalayas to sell her calicoes to the numberless people \\n of Asia, and divide with France the empires of India, \\n Burmah and China. Civilization does not lose by their \\n expansion. Russia may push her diplomacy upon Pekin, \\n and her armies through the Caucasus, and upon Persia \\n and Tartary; she may even plant her Greek cross again \\n on the mosque of St. Sophia, and take the Grecian Levant \\n into her keeping as the head of its church and civilization. \\n France may plant her forts and arts upon the shores of the \\n Red Sea ; complete the canalization of Suez ; erect another \\n Carthage on the shores of the Mediterranean; bind her \\n natural limits from Mont Blanc, in Savoy, to Nice, upon \\n the sea.

They are links in the endless chain of Providence. \\n They prove the mutability of the most imperial of human \\n institutions, but, to the philosophic observer, they move \\n by a law as fixed as that which makes the decay of autumn \\n the herald of spring. They obey the same law by which \\n the constellations change their places in the sky. Astron- \\n omers tell us that the \"southern cross,\" which guarded \\n the adventurer upon the Spanish main four centuries ago, \\n and which now can be seen, the most beautiful emblem of \\n our salvation, shining down through a Cuban and Mexi- \\n can night, — ^just before the Christian era, glittered in our \\n northern heavens ! The same great will, which knows \\n no North and no South, and which is sending again, by \\n an irreversible law, the southern cross to our northern \\n skies, on its everlasting cycle of emigration — does it not \\n control the revolutions of nations, and the vicissitudes \\n of empires ? The very stars in their courses are \"Knights \\n of the Golden Circle,\" and illustrate the record of human \\n advancement. They are the type of that territorial ex- \\n pansion from which this American continent can not be \\n exempted without annihilation. The finger of Providence \\n points to our nation as the guiding star of this progress. \\n Let him who would either dusk its radiancy, or make it \\n the meteor of a moment, cast again with nicer heed our \\n nation\\'s horoscope. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Necessity has compelled experience in the case of \\n the former, but the latter has depended upon some one \\n else for this service, and fortunately for the sake of \\n society, it is rarely he is obliged to resort to the needle \\n himself. Sometimes the patient wife scalds her right \\n hand or runs a sliver under the nail of the index finger \\n of that hand, and it is then the man clutches the needle \\n around the neck, and, forgetting to tie a knot on the \\n thread, commences to put on the button. It is always \\n in the morning, and from five to twenty minutes after \\n this he is expected to be down street. He lays the but- \\n ton exactly on the site of its predecessor, and pushes the \\n needle through one eye, and carefully draws the thread \\n after, leaving about three inches of it sticking up for \\n leeway. He says to himself, \"Well, if women don\\'t have \\n the easiest time I ever see.\" Then he comes back the \\n other way and gets the needle through the cloth easy \\n enough, and lays himself out to find the eye, but, in spite \\n of a great deal of patient jabbing, the needle point per- \\n sists in bucking against the solid parts of the button, and \\n finally, when he loses patience, his fingers catch the thread, \\n and that three inches he has left to hold the button slips \\n through the eye in a twinkling, and the button rolls \\n leisurely across the floor. He picks it up without a single \\n remark, out of respect for his children, and makes another \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#509) ################################################\\n\\nPROSE SELECTIONS. 415 \\n \\n attempt to fasten it. This time, when coming back with \\n the needle, he keeps both the thread and button from \\n sHpping, by covering them with his thumb; and it is out \\n of regard for that part of him that he feels around for \\n the eye in a very careful and judicious manner, but eventu- \\n ally losing his philosophy as the search becomes more and \\n more hopeless, he falls to jabbing about in a loose and \\n savage manner, and it is just then the needle finds the \\n opening and comes through the button and part way \\n through his thumb with a celerity that no human ingenu- \\n ity can guard against. Then he lays down the things \\n with a few familiar quotations, and presses the injured \\n hand between his knees, and then holds it under the other \\n arm, and finally jams it into his mouth, and all the while \\n he prances and calls upon heaven and earth to witness \\n that there has never been anything like it since the world \\n was created, and howls, and whistles, and moans and sobs. \\n After awhile he calms down and puts on his pants, and \\n fastens them together with a stick, and goes to his business \\n a changed man. \\n \\n A LECTURE. \\n \\n ARTEMUS WARD. \\n \\n You are entirely welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to my \\n little picture-shop. \\n \\n I couldn\\'t give you a very clear idea of the Mormons — \\n and Utah — and the Plains — ^and the Rocky Mountains — \\n without opening a picture-shop — and therefore I open \\n one. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Hapgood; from The Independent.) \\n \\n Once on a time, father and I set out on a hunting ex- \\n pedition, just before St. Peter\\'s Day. At that season the \\n young partridges are still small. Father did not wish \\n to shoot them, and so went among the small oak-shrubs, \\n by the side of a rye-field, where quails were always to \\n be found. It was hard to mow there — ^the grass had stood \\n undisturbed for a long while. Such a quantity of flowers \\n grew there — ^vetches and clover and blue-bells, forget-me- \\n nots and wild pinks. When I went thither with my sisters \\n or the maid, I always plucked whole armfuls of them ; but \\n when I went with father I plucked no flowers; I con- \\n sidered that occupation as beneath the dignity of a sports- \\n man. \\n \\n AH at once Treasure made a point ; my father shouted : \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

But she flew very oddly; \\n she turned somersaults, twisted in a circle, and fell on \\n the ground, exactly as though she were wounded, or as \\n though her wing was broken. Treasure rushed after her \\n at the full speed of his legs ; he never did this when the \\n bird flew as it should. Father could not even shoot, be- \\n cause he was afraid that he should hit the dog with the \\n small shot. And, suddenly, I see that Treasure has over- \\n taken her, and — slap! he has caught the quail, has brought \\n it and given it to my father. My father took it and laid \\n it in his palm, with its belly up. I ran to him. \\n \"What is it?\" I say. \"Was she wounded?\" \\n \"No,\" replies my father; \"she was not wounded; but \\n she must have a nest of young ones near by, and she \\n pretended to be wounded on purpose, so that the dog \\n would think that he could catch her easily.\" \\n \"What did she do that for?\" I asked. \\n \"In order to lead the dog away from her little ones. \\n Afterward she would have flown well. Only, on this \\n occasion, she miscalculated. She pretended too well, and \\n Treasure caught her.\" \\n \"So she is not wounded?\" I inquired again. \\n \"No ; but she will not live. Treasure must have crushed \\n her with his teeth.\" \\n \\n I approached nearer the quail. She lay motionless in \\n ray father\\'s hand, with her little head hanging, and look- \\n ing sideways at me with her little brown eyes. And, all \\n at once, I felt so sorry for her! It seemed to me that \\n she was gazing at me and thinking: \"Why must I die? \\n For what reason? Surely, I have done my duty; I have \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Poor creature! \\n This is unjust ! — unjust !\" \\n \\n \"Papa !\" said I, \"perhaps she will not die,\" and I tried \\n to stroke the quail on the head. But my father said to \\n me : \"No ; look here ; she has just stretched out her legs, \\n she is quivering all over, and her eyes are closing.\" \\n \\n And so it was. As soon as she closed her eyes, I burst \\n out crying. \\n \\n \"What\\'s the matter with you?\" asked my father, and \\n began to laugh. \\n \\n \"I am sorry for her,\" said I. \"She did her duty — ^and \\n she got killed. That is unjust.\" \\n \\n \"She tried to be cunning,\" replied my father. \"Only \\n Treasure was more cunning than she was.\" \\n \\n \"Wicked Treasure,\" I said to myself; and even my \\n father did not seem good to me on this occasion. What \\n cunning was there about it? It was love for her little \\n children, and not cunning. If she had been commanded \\n to use craft to save her children — ^then Treasure ought \\n not to have caught her. \\n \\n My father was on the point of thrusting the quail into \\n his game-back, but I begged her from him, laid her care- \\n fully in both my palms, and breathed upon her — to see \\n whether she would not recover. But she did not stir. \\n \\n \"It is useless, my dear fellow,\" said father, \"you can\\'t \\n bring her back to life.\" \\n \\n I lifted her carefully by the beak; but as soon as I \\n removed my hand, her head fell again. \\n \\n \"Are you still sorry for her ?\" asked my father. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#518) ################################################\\n\\n422 PROSE SELECTIONS. \\n \\n \"And who will feed her little ones ?\" I inquired, in my \\n turn. \\n \\n My father gazed intently at me. \"Don\\'t trouble your- \\n self about that,\" said he; \"the male quail, their father, \\n will feed them. And stand still,\" he added. \"Treasure \\n seems to be making another point. Can it be the nest? \\n And the nest it is.\" \\n \\n And sure enough, in the grass, a couple of paces from \\n Treasure\\'s muzzle, lay four tiny birds in a row; they \\n were huddling close to each other, and stretching out \\n their little necks, and all were breathing so rapidly and \\n simultaneously that it seemed as though they were trem- \\n bling. And they had already got their feathers — there \\n was no down on them — only their little tails were .«till \\n very short. \\n \\n \"Papa ! Papa 1\" I cried, at the top of my voice ; \"call \\n off Treasure, or he will kill them too.\" \\n \\n My father called to Treasure, and, retiring a little to \\n one side, he sat down to eat his lunch, under a bush. But \\n I remained beside the nest, and did not want to eat any \\n lunch. I took out my clean handkerchief and laid the \\n quail on it. \\n \\n \"Look here, orphans, here is your mother! She sacri- \\n ficed herself for you !\" \\n \\n The little birds breathed rapidly, as before, with the \\n whole of their bodies. Then I went to my father. \\n \\n \"Will you give me this quail?\" I asked him. \\n \\n \"If you like. But what do you want to do with it ?\" \\n \\n \"I want to bury it.\" \\n \\n \"Bury it?\" \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

I \\n will dig her a grave.\" \\n \\n My father wras amazed. \\n \\n \"So that her little ones can visit the grave ?\" he asked. \\n \\n \"No,\" I replied; \"but because — I want to. It will be \\n so nice for her to lie there beside her nest!\" \\n \\n My father did not say a word. He took out his knife \\n and gave it to me. I immediately excavated a little hol- \\n low ; then I kissed the quail on her breast, and laid her \\n in the hole, and covered her with earth. Then, with the \\n same knife, I cut two small branches, stripped the bark \\n from them, placed them in the form of a cross, bound \\n them together with a blade of grass, and stuck them up- \\n right in the grave. \\n \\n My father and I soon moved on; but I kept looking \\n back. The cross was whitish and visible at a distance. \\n \\n And that night I had a dream. I seemed to be in \\n Heaven ; and what then ? On a small cloud sits my dear \\n little quail, only now she is all white, like that little cross ! \\n And around her head is a small gold haiei and it seems \\n that it has been given to her to reward her for her suffer- \\n ings for the sake of her children. \\n \\n Five days later, my father and I returned again to the \\n same spot. I found the grave and the cross, which had \\n turned yellow, but had not fallen. Only the little nest \\n was empty, there was no trace of the birds. My father \\n assured me that the old bird, their father, had taken them \\n away; and when an old quail flew out from under the \\n bushes a few paces away, my father did not try to shoot \\n him. And I said to myself: \"Yes, papa is good!\" \\n \\n But this is the remarkable point about it: from that \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

CLEMENS. \\n \\n (Speech of Mark Twain at the banquet given in honor \\n \\n of General Grant, by the Army of the Tennessee, at \\n \\n the Palmer House, Chicago, November 14, 1879.) \\n \\n TOAST : \\n \\n \"The Babies — As they comfort us in our sorrows, let \\n us not forget them in our festivities.\" \\n \\n I like that. We haven\\'t all had the good fortune to \\n be ladies ; we haven\\'t all been generals, or poets, or states- \\n men; but when the toast works down to the babies, we \\n stand on common ground, for we have all been babies. \\n It is a shame that for a thousand years the world\\'s ban- \\n quets have utterly ignored the baby — as if he didn\\'t \\n amount to anything! If you gentlemen will stop and \\n think a minute, — if you will go back fifty or a hundred \\n years, to your early married life, and recontemplate your \\n first baby, you will remember that he amounted to a good \\n deal, and even something over. You soldiers all know \\n that\\'when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters \\n you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire com- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

He was not a commander \\n who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or any- \\n thing else. You had to execute his order whether it was \\n possible or not. And there was only one form of march- \\n ing in his manual of tactics, and that was the double- \\n quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and \\n disrespect, and the bravest of you didn\\'t dare to say a \\n word. You could face the death-storm of Donelson and \\n Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he \\n clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted \\n your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war \\n were sounding in your ears, you set yout faces toward \\n the batteries and advanced with steady tread ; but when \\n he turned on the terrors of his war-whoop, you advanced \\n in the other direction — and mighty glad of the chance, too. \\n When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to \\n throw out any side remarks about certain services unbe- \\n coming an officer and a gentleman.\\' No, — you orot up and \\n got it. If he ordered his bottle, and it wasn\\'t v/arm, did \\n you talk back ? Not you, — ^you went to work and warmed \\n it. You even descended so far in your menial office as \\n to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see \\n if it was right, — ^three parts water to one of milk, a touch \\n of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop of peppermint \\n to kill tliose immortal hiccups. I can taste that stuff yet. \\n And how many things you learned as you went along; \\n sentimental young folks still took stock in that beautiful \\n old saying that when the baby smiles in his sleep, it is \\n because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, \\n but \"too thin,\" — simply wind on the stomach, my friends 1 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Oh, you were under \\n good disipline! and you went fluttering up and down \\n the room in your \"undress uniform\" you not only prattled \\n undignified baby-talk, but even tuned up your martial \\n voices and tried to sing \"Rockaby baby in a tree-top,\" for \\n instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennes- \\n see 1 And what an affliction for the neighbors, too, — for \\n it isn\\'t everybody within a mile around that likes military \\n music at three in the morning. And when you had been \\n keeping this sort of thing up for two or three hours, and \\n your little velvet-head intimated that nothing suited him \\n like exercise and noise, — \"Go on!\" — ^what did you do? \\n You simply went on, till you disappeared in the last \\n ditch. \\n \\n The idea that a baby doesn\\'t amount to iiiiy thing I Why, \\n one baby is just a house and a front-yard full by itself. \\n One baby can furnish more business than you and your \\n whole interior department can attend to.

But alas! we should leave behind us, on our \\n own shores, more wives in the fire than we should find \\n of widows thus sacrificed in all the E^st; a fire, too, \\n which, besides its action upon the body, tortures the soul \\n by lost affections, and ruined hopes, and prospective \\n wretchedness. \\n \\n Every year thousands of families are robbed of fathers, \\n brothers, husbands, friends.

No disease makes such inroads \\n upon families, blasts so many iiopes, destroys so many \\n lives, and causes so many mourners to go about the \\n streets, because man goeth to his long home. \\n \\n Can we lawfully amass property by a course of trade \\n which fills the land with beggars, and widows, and or- \\n phans, and crimes — which peoples the graveyard with \\n premature mortality, and the world of woe with the vic- \\n tims of despair? \\n \\n Could all the forms of evil produced in the land by \\n intemperance, come upon us in one horrid array, it \\n would appall the nation, and put an end to traffic in ar- \\n dent spirits.

Therefore, that we \\n may determine what is chiefly useful to man, it is nec- \\n essary first to determine the use of man himself. \\n \\n Man\\'s use and function is to be the witness of the \\n glory of God, and to advance that glory by his reason- \\n able obedience and reluctant happiness. \\n \\n Whatever enables us to fulfill this function is, in the \\n pure and first sense of the word, useful to us. Pre-emi- \\n nently, therefore, what sets the glory of God more \\n brightly before us. But things that only help us to \\n exist are, in a secondary and mean sense, useful, or \\n rather, if they be looked for alone, they are useless and \\n worse, for it would be better that we should not exist, \\n than that we should guiltily disappoint the purposes of \\n existence. \\n \\n And yet people speak in this working age, when they \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

And so comes upon us that woe of Ae \\n preacher that, though God \"hath made everything b«au- \\n tiful in his time, also he hath set the world in their hearts, \\n so that no man can find out the work that God maketh \\n from the beginning to the end.\" \\n \\n This Nebuchadnezzar curse, that sends us to grass like \\n oxen, seems to follow but too closely on the excess or \\n continuance of national power and peace.

Out of the \\n suffering comes the serious mind; out of the salvation, \\n the grateful heart; out of the endurance, the fortitude; \\n out of the deliverance, the faith ; but now when they have \\n learned to live under providence of laws, and with de- \\n cency and justice and regard for each other, and when \\n they have done away with violent and external sources of \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

And deep though the causes of \\n thankfulness must be to every people at peace with oth- \\n ers and at unity in itself, there are causes of fear also, a \\n fear greater than the sword and sedition : that dependence \\n on God may be forgotten, because the bread is given \\n and the water is sure; that gratitude to him may cease, \\n because his constancy of protection has taken the sem- \\n blance of a natural law; that heavenly hope may grow \\n faint amidst the full fruition of the world; that selfish- \\n ness may take place of undemanded devotion, compas- \\n sion be lost in vainglory, and love in dissimulation ; that \\n innovation may succeed to strength, apathy to patience, \\n and the noise of jesting words and foulness of dark \\n thoughts, to the earnest purity of the girded loins and the \\n burning lamp. \\n \\n I am aware there is a prejudice against any mpn en- \\n gaged in the manufacture of alcohol.

It feeds \\n rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites \\n cholera, imports pestilence, and embraces consumption. \\n It covers the land with idleness, poverty, disease and \\n crime.

O, yes ! the men \\n that fight for a great enterprise are the men that bear \\n the brunt of the battle, and \"He who seeth in secret\" — \\n seeth the desire of his children, their steady purpose, their \\n firm self-denial — \"will reward them openly,\" though they \\n may die and see no sign of the triumph of their enter- \\n prise. \\n \\n Our cause is a progressive one.

Some are living \\n to-day; and I should like to stand where they stand \\n now, and see the mighty enterprise as it rises before them. \\n They worked hard.

D. \\n \\n Life, death, eternity — ^how vast, how deep, how solemn \\n these three words, so familiar to us all ! Who can meas- \\n ure, who can fathom their meaning? In the midst of \\n life we are surrounded by death, and confronted by eter- \\n nity with its boundless prospects of weal and woe. Life \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Theology can- \\n not determine the locality of that invisible universe from \\n which no traveler returns, nor the direction and length of \\n that lonely passage which carries the disembodied spirit \\n from its present to its future abode. But this we do \\n know, and it is enough for our comfort, that in our Fa- \\n ther\\'s house are many mansions, and that our Savior \\n has prepared a place for all his disciples. There is an \\n abundance of room for all even within the limits of this \\n universe, and for aught we know, the spirit world may be \\n verynear and around about us. There are exalted moments \\n in our life when we see the heavens open and the angels \\n of God descending and ascending. Life is a mystery, a \\n glorious mystery with a heaven beyond, but a terrible \\n mystery with annihilation or endless punishment in pros- \\n pect. \\n \\n The immortality of the soul is a universal instinct and \\n desire of the human race. Like the idea of (jOd; it is im- \\n planted in our intellectual and moral constitution. We \\n cannot think backward without reaching an ultimate \\n cause which has no beginning; we cannot thipk forward \\n without arriving at a result which has ho ending. God \\n and eternity precede time and succeecl. time, and time \\n itself is filled with both. We cannot concei-^e that a»wise \\n Creator should make man in his own image and^ endow \\n him with the highest faculties without ordaining him for \\n endless existence. He cannot intend the head of His \\n creatures, the masterpiece of His hand to perish like the \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

He cannot allow virtue to suffer and iniquity to \\n flourish without some future adjustment which will give \\n to every one his due, and restore the harmony of char- \\n acter and condition. \\n \\n It seems impossible that a rational being filled with \\n infinite longings and capable of endless progress should \\n be suddenly cut off in the beginning of its career, \"like \\n the empty fabric of a vision leaving no wreck behind.\" \\n It seems impossible that the mind, which proves its in- \\n dependence of the body and matures in strength while \\n the body declines, should be dissolved with its material \\n tent. No husband can close the eyes of a beloved wife, \\n no parent can commit a child to the cold grave, no friend \\n can bid farewell to a bosom friend without the ardent \\n wish for the recovery of the loss and a meeting again in \\n a better world, where tears of parting are unknown. \\n Every consideration of God\\'s goodness, love, and justice; \\n of man\\'s capacities, desires, and hopes ; and of surround- \\n ing nature, with its perennial renovations of seasons and \\n transformation of death itself into new forms of life, \\n forces upon us the belief in the immortality of the human \\n soul. \\n \\n But after all, philosophy and science can lead us only \\n to the probability of immortality, and there is a vast step \\n from probability to certainty. The starry heavens above \\n and the moral law within may well have filled the great \\n philosopher of the last century with ever growing rev- \\n erence and awe; but beyond the starry heavens and be- \\n hind the moral law lie the sublimer regions of faith, \\n which fill us with deeper reverence, and which alone cap \\n give us solid comfort in life and in death. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

The city, with its ten thousand \\n sights and sounds, stirred his soul. To see with his own \\n eyes the wonderful things of which his fellow clerks told, \\n did not accord with his conscience or his promises to the \\n dear folks at home. But they were \"slow,\\'\\' and \"behind \\n the age.\" \"There can be no harm in going just once to \\n the theater; lots of church members go there.\" So over \\n the sins of worldly church members, Charley stumbled. \\n \\n Hamlet was played that night.

It was the \\n most systematic snoring that was ever done, even on one \\n of these tournaments of snoring, a sleeping-car. He \\n didn\\'t begin as soon as the lamps were turned and every- \\n body was in bed. Oh, no ! There was more cold-blooded \\n diabolism in his system than that. He waited until every- \\n body had a taste of sleep, just to see how nice and \\n pleasant it was, and then he broke in on their slumbers \\n like a winged, breathing demon, and they never knew \\n what peace was again that night. \\n \\n He started out with a terrific \\n \\n \"Gu-r-r-rt!\" \\n that opened every eye in the car. We all hoped it was \\n an accident, however, and trusting that he wouldn\\'t do it \\n again, we all forgave him. Then he blasted our hopes \\n and curdled the sweet serenity of our forgiveness by a \\n long-drawn \\n \\n \"Gwa-a-h-h-hah!\" \\n that sounded too much like business to be accidental. \\n Then every head in that sleepless sleeper was held off the \\n pillow for a minute, waiting in breathless suspense to hear \\n the worst, and the sleeper in \"lower three\" went on in \\n long drawn, regular cadences that indicated good staying \\n qualities, \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

It mumbled along in low, muttering \\n tones, like the distant echoes of a profane thunder-storm. \\n Pretty soon \"lower three\" gave us a little variation. He \\n shot off a spiteful \\n \\n \"Gwook!\" \\n which sounded as though his nose had got mad at him \\n and was going to strike. Then there was a pause, and \\n we began to hope he had either awakened from sleep or \\n strangled to death — nobody cared very particularly which. \\n Bat he disappointed everybody with a guttural \\n \\n \"Gurroch!\" \\n \\n Then he paused again for breath, and when he had \\n accumulated enough for his purpose he resumed business \\n with a stentorious \\n \\n \"Kowpff!\" \\n that nearly shot the roof off the car. Then he went on \\n playing such fantastic tricks with his nose, and breathing \\n things that would make the immortal gods weep, if they \\n did but hear him. It seemed an utter, pteposterous im- \\n possibility that any human being could make the mon- \\n strous, hideous noises with his breathing machine that the \\n fellow in \"lower three\" was making with his. He then \\n ran through all the ranges of the usual gamut ; he went \\n up and down a very chromatic scale of snores; he ran \\n through intricate and fearful variations until it seemed \\n that his nose must be out of joint in a thousand places. \\n All the night and all the day through he told his story. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

He had one. He looked sorrowfully att me, as \\n though he pitied me. Did I ever ride a mule? I never \\n had. He had as good riding horses as were ever sad- \\n dled, but if I wanted a \"Rock Me to Sleep, Mother,\" \\n style of a ride, I would take a mule.

He \\n was a meek-looking mule — a perfect \"Uriah Heep\" of a \\n mule, so far as \" \\'umbleness\" was concerned. At least \\n that was the view I took of him. He was saddled, and \\n I mounted. For a mile or two he paced beautifully. I \\n thought those old monks I had read about knew what \\n they were doing when they traveled on mules. I had a \\n high respect for their judgment. Just then my mule \\n began to show symptoms — symptoms of what I did not \\n know. I found out. Dropping his head between his \\n legs, his heels described a parabolic curve in the air, and \\n I got oflf and sat on the ground. I got over his head, and \\n did it quick. I am not so old but I can get off an animal \\n of that kind as quick as a boy. Then I looked at the \\n mule to see if he was hurt. He didn\\'t appear to be. Then \\n I inquired around to see how I was. I reported an \\n abrasion on the left hip, and a contusion on the lower end \\n of my back. Then I thought I would pronounce a left- \\n handed blessing on that mule, on forefathers and fore- \\n mothers before him, and on children after him. But I \\n didn\\'t. I wondered if he would stand fire. If I had had \\n a pistol, I would have put the muzzle to his ear and tried \\n him. Not that I was hostile toward him, but I was \\n afraid somebody might take a ride on him some day and \\n get hurt. But I had no pistol, so that benevolent san- \\n guinary idea was frustrated.

Then I led the \\n mule carefully home, and stated my case to the livery \\n man. But when I looked that he should offer to send for \\n a doctor or a Samaritan to do me up in a rag, and pour \\n olive oil and champagne on my bruises, he only laughed. \\n And his man that he had to help him laid down on a \\n bench and laughed — then rolled off the bench and \\n laughed. It was ridiculous. But I\\'ve learned a little \\n wisdom.

Were I to tell you the story of \\n Washington, I should take it from your hearts, — you, \\n who think no marble white enough on which to carve the \\n name of the Father of his country. But I am to tell you \\n the story of a negro who has left hardly one written line. \\n I am to glean it from the reluctant testimony of Britons, \\n Frenchmen, Spaniards, — men who despised him as a \\n negro and a slave, and hated him because he had beaten \\n them in battle. All the materials for his biography are \\n from the lips of his enemies. Let us pause a moment, \\n and find something to measure him by. You remember \\n Macaulay says, comparing Cromwell with Napoleon, that \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Cromwell manufactured his own \\n army ; Napoleon at the age of twenty-seven was placed at \\n the head of the best troops Europe ever saw. They were \\n both successful; but, says Macaulay, with such disad- \\n vantages, the Englishmen showed the greater genius. \\n Whether you allow the inference or not, you will at least \\n grant that it is a fair mode of measurement. Apply it \\n to this negro. Cromwell never saw an army till he was \\n forty; this man never saw a soldier till he was fifty. \\n Cromwell manufactured his own army — out of what? \\n Englishmen, — ^the best blood in Europe. Out of the \\n middle class of Englishmen, — ^the best blood of the isl- \\n and. And with it he conquered what? Englishmen, — \\n their equals. This man manufactured his army out of \\n what? Out of what you call the despicable race of ne- \\n groes, debased, demoralized by two hundred years of \\n slavery, one hundred thousand of them, imported into \\n the island within four years, unable to speak a dialect in- \\n telligible even to each other. Yet out of this mixed, and, \\n as you say, despicable mass, he forged a thunderbolt \\n and hurled it at what? At the proudest blood in Eu- \\n rope, the Spaniard, and sent him home conquered ; at the \\n most warlike blood in Europe, the French, and put them \\n under his feet; at the pluckiest blood in Europe, the \\n English, and they skulked home to Jamaica. Now, if \\n Cromwell was a general, this man at least was a soldier. \\n 1 know it was a small territory ; it was not as large as \\n the continent; but it was as large as that Attica which. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Not one line in the statute-book of Brit- \\n ain can be traced to Cromwell ; not one step in the social \\n life of England finds its motive power in his brain. The \\n state he founded went down with him to his grave. But \\n this man no sooner put his hand on the helm of State \\n than the ship steadied with an upright keel, and he began \\n to evince a statesmanship as marvelous as his military \\n genius. \\n \\n He was a negr-o.

England promised by a spe- \\n cial message to be neutral; and you know neutrality \\n means sneering at freedom, and sending arms to tyrants. \\n England promised neutrality, and the black looked out \\n on the whole civilized world marshalled against him. \\n America, full of slaves, of course was hostile, only the \\n Yankee sold him poor muskets at a very high price. \\n Mounting his horse, and riding to the eastern end of the \\n island, Samana, he looked out on a sight such as no native \\n had ever seen before. Sixty ships of the line, crowded \\n by the best soldiers of Europe, rounded the point. They \\n were soldiers who had never yet met an equal, whose \\n tread, like Caesar\\'s, had shaken Europe, — soldiers who \\n had scaled the Pyramids, and planted the French ban- \\n ners on the walls of Rome. He looked a moment, count- \\n ed the flotilla, let the reins fall on the neck of his horse, \\n and, turning to Christophe, exclaimed: \"All France is \\n come to Hayti; they can only come to make us slaves; \\n and we are lost !\" He then recognized the only mistake \\n of his life, — his confidence in Bonaparte, which had led \\n him to disband hi$ army. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

When the great \\n William of Orange saw Louis XIV. cover Holland with \\n troops, he said, \"Break down the dikes; give Holland \\n back to the ocean ;\" and Europe said, \"Sublime 1\" When \\n the Alexander saw the armies of France descend upon \\n Russia, he said, \"Burn Moscow, starve back the invad- \\n ers;\" and Europe said, \"Sublime!\" This black saw all \\n Europe marshalled to crush him, and gave to his people \\n the same heroic example of defiance. \\n \\n Some doubt the courage of the negro.

I hope \\n to produce a Work on Elocution suited to all per- \\n sons, whether old or young. AVhile I do not hold \\n myself responsible for all the assertions of the tal- \\n ented Doctor, I yet agree with him in most of his \\n remarks, and believe his work can be studied with \\n great advantage. \\n \\n All persons ought to be aware how important it is \\n to attend to the modulation of the voice. The chief \\n beauty of oratory is in the melody of the speaker\\'s \\n utterance. If the orator delivers his* own ideas, or \\n those of another, how soon his hearers become indif- \\n ferent if the speech is delivered in one tone of voice ! \\n Bat, when the speaker whose voice is cultivated and \\n modulated, is heard, every ear listens with delight, \\n every eye beams upon him with pleasure ; the feel- \\n ings of his hearers will be at one time melted into \\n tears by the pathos of his tones, at another roused \\n \\n (iii) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

I \\n advise all who wish to become fine readers and speak- \\n ers, to study with the greatest attention Dr. Corn- \\n stock\\'s work, as they will there find important truths \\n fully analyzed and explained. \\n \\n But, while studying this noble art, remember that \\n Elocution is not a science that can be learned from \\n books; it is an art, and can be imparted by the \\n living teacher alone. \\n \\n Every feeling and emotion of the human heart \\n can be expressed by the tones of the voice ; and as, \\n by appropriate gesture, every thing we say can be \\n made plain to the understanding through the sight, \\n so also, by giving every word its proper sound, can \\n it be made perfectly intelligible to the ear. There- \\n fore, as this can be done only by a finished reader or \\n orator, I repeat, the living teacher alone can instruct \\n \\n in Elocution. \\n \\n PHILIP LAWRENCE. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#11) #################################################\\n\\nTHIS work is a system of Theoretical \\n and Practical Elocution. It is de- \\n signed for the use of Schools and Colleges, \\n as well as for the instruction of private \\n individuals who desire to improve them- \\n selves in the art of reading and speaking. \\n The arrangement of the several parts of \\n the work is strictly systematic: each is \\n discussed in its natural order, and with as \\n much brevity as consists with perspicuity* \\n \\n The analysis of the vocal elements of \\n the English language, and the minute de- \\n scription which is given of their organic \\n formation, will be found important, not \\n only to the American who is desirous of \\n accurate knowledge upon this subject, but \\n also to the foreigner who is learning to \\n speak our vernacular tongue. And the \\n engravings, indicating the most favourable \\n postures of the mouth in the energetic \\n utterance of the elements, w T ill be found \\n a valuable auxiliary in the acquisition of \\n \\n this knowledge. \\n \\n (v) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#12) #################################################\\n\\nvi PREFACE. \\n \\n In ordinary works on Elocution, the inflections of the \\n voice are given, but not the changes of pitch, which \\n constitute melody. In this work, however, not only are \\n the inflections and the melody given, but also those tran- \\n sitions in pitch, called modulation, or a change of key. \\n My method of representing the melody and modula- \\n tions of the speaking voice, is original ; and, I feel con- \\n fident, it will prove of singular advantage to the Stu- \\n dent in Elocution. \\n \\n The part on gesture is extracted, principally, from \\n Austin\\'s Chironomia, a work which is extremely rare, \\n and one whose great size and expense are insuperable \\n obstacles to its general introduction. All, however, \\n that is particularly valuable, which the Chironomia con- \\n tains on the subject of gesture, is here presented to the \\n reader in the compass of a few pages. Austin\\'s system \\n of notation of gesture is of great practical utility. \\n This will appear evident to the reader when he shall \\n have learned that, by its application, all the gestures \\n which an orator makes, in the delivery of a discourse, \\n may be accurately recorded for his own practice and \\n improvement, as well as for the benefit of posterity. \\n \\n In the practical part of this work, are Exercises in \\n Articulation, Pitch, Force, Time, and Gesture. These \\n are important, not only to the Student in Elocution, but \\n also to the Stammerer. In training the muscles of \\n speech, as well as those of gesticulation, I begin with \\n exercises of the most energetic kind; because these \\n only will produce the desired effect: by diligently prac- \\n tising energetic exercises, the Student soon acquires a \\n strength and compass of voice, a distinctness of utter- \\n ance, and a freedom and gracefulness of action, which \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. (#13) #################################################\\n\\nPREFACE. vii \\n \\n he could not attain by practising those of an opposite \\n character. \\n \\n The Exercises in Reading and Declamation have \\n been taken from some of the best ancient and modern \\n authors ; and they are well adapted to the purposes of \\n the Student in Elocution. They are divided into para- \\n graphs, and subdivided into sections. The latter divi- \\n sion is marked by vertical bars. In concert reading, \\n as soon as a section is pronounced by the teacher, the \\n members of the class should repeat it together, in the \\n proper pitch and time, and with the requisite degree of \\n force. When a paragraph shall have been pronounced \\n in this way, it should be read singly by each member \\n of the class. Sometimes it will be found advantageous \\n to let each pupil, in turn, give out a piece, and the other \\n members of the class repeat it after him ; the teacher, \\n meanwhile, making the necessary corrections. In fine, \\n the exercise of reading should be practised in a variety \\n of ways according to circumstances. When a piece \\n is given out with gesticulation, the members of the class \\n should rise simultaneously, immediately after the first \\n section is pronounced, and repeat the words and ges- \\n ture. As the organs of speech require much training \\n to enable them to perform their functions -properly, the \\n pupil should repeat the same exercise till he can articu- \\n late every element, and give to each syllable the pitch, \\n force, and time which the sentiment demands. \\n \\n The art of reading and speaking is not inferior in \\n importance to any branch of learning ; yet there is none \\n more generally neglected. While many of the merely \\n ornamental branches are cultivated with zealous assi- \\n duity, Elocution is allowed, at best, but a feeble sup- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p.

Among the numerous colleges with which our \\n country abounds, there is not, perhaps, a single one \\n endowed with a professorship of Elocution ! And \\n among our numerous public speakers, how small a num- \\n ber can deliver a discourse without having half the body \\n concealed by a desk or table ! The orators of classic \\n Greece never ensconced themselves behind elevated \\n desks, nor \" stood upon all fours\" as some of our public \\n speakers do :* they were masters of their art. Hence \\n they needed no screen to conceal uncouth attitudes and \\n awkward gestures from the scrutinizing eye of criti- \\n cism; nor had occasion to present the crown of the \\n head, instead of the face, to the audience, to hide the \\n blush of ignorance : they exposed the whole person to \\n the audience ; they stood erect, in all the dignity of con- \\n scious worth; their attitudes were fit models for the \\n statuary; their gestures were replete with grace and \\n expression ; their elocution defied criticism. \\n \\n Let us endeavour to restore Elocution to its former \\n place in the department of useful instruction. Nothing \\n is wanted but a correct medium, laudable ambition, and \\n common industry, to enable our American youth to \\n rival those ancient orators whose eloquence, it is said, \\n \" shook distant thrones, and made the extremities of the \\n earth tremble.\" \\n \\n ANDREW COMSTOCK. \\n \\n * See Figure 1, page 70. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 5 (#15) ###############################################\\n\\nCONTENTS \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n PAGE. \\n \\n Introduction 11 \\n \\n Preliminary Observations 14 \\n \\n Elocution 15 \\n \\n PART I. \\n YOOAL GYMNASTICS. \\n \\n Yocal Gymnastics 15 \\n \\n Articulation 16 \\n \\n Elements of the English Language 18 \\n \\n Classification of the Elements 19 \\n \\n The Yowels 21 \\n \\n The Sub-vowels , 23 \\n \\n The Aspirates 25 \\n \\n The Postures of the Mouth 27 \\n \\n Defective Articulation 30 \\n \\n Lisping 32 \\n \\n Stammering ■ • • ■ 33 \\n \\n Pitch 38 \\n \\n Keys of the Speaking Yoice 46 \\n \\n Inflections 47 \\n \\n Melody 52 \\n \\n Modulation 53 \\n \\n Force 59 \\n \\n Time 63 \\n \\n PART II. \\n GESTURE. \\n \\n Gesture 69 \\n \\n Postures of the Body 69 \\n \\n Postures unfavorable to Yocal Delivery 70 \\n \\n Postures favorable to Yocal Delivery 71 \\n \\n (5) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 6 (#16) ###############################################\\n\\n6 CONTENTS. \\n \\n Demonstrating\\' on the Black-board 71 \\n \\n Manner of holding 1 the Book *?2 \\n \\n Notation of Gesture 73 \\n \\n Positions of the Feet and Lower Limbs 76 \\n \\n Positions, Motions, and Elevations of the Arms 84 \\n \\n Postures and motions of the Hands 93 \\n \\n The head, the Eyes, the Shoulders, and the Body 104 \\n \\n The Stroke and Time of Gesture 105 \\n \\n The Classification of Gesture 108 \\n \\n The Preparation, Transition, and Accompaniment of \\n \\n Gesture 113 \\n \\n The Frequency, Moderation, and Intermission of Gesture. 123 \\n The Qualities of Gesture, and the Gesture suited to \\n \\n different modes of Public Speaking 125 \\n \\n Significant Gestures 129 \\n \\n Complex Significant Gestures 131 \\n \\n Grace 147 \\n \\n Synoptical Arrangement of the Notation Letters 150 \\n \\n Application of the Notation Letters 152 \\n \\n Question to be Answered by the Pupil 175 \\n \\n PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. \\n \\n PART I. \\n \\n EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION, PITCH, FORCE, \\n TIME, AND GESTURE. \\n Exercises in Articulation, Pitch, Force, Time, and \\n \\n Gesture 183 \\n \\n Table of the Elements of the English Language 1 83 \\n \\n Emphasis Melodies 188 \\n \\n Interrogative Sentences 190 \\n \\n Force 192 \\n \\n Modulation 192 \\n \\n Tremour 193 \\n \\n Time and Gesture 194 \\n \\n Method of Beating Time with the Dumb-Bells 194 \\n \\n Syllable Rhythm 195 \\n \\n Poetry Rythm 195 \\n \\n First Period of Gesture 198 \\n \\n Second Period of Gesture 199 \\n \\n Pronunciation 200 \\n \\n Declamation 200 \\n \\n Method of Teaching Declamation 201 \\n \\n Speech of Satan to his Legions, with Gestures 201 \\n \\n The Miser and Plutus, with Gestures 208 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 7 (#17) ###############################################\\n\\nCONTENTS. *l \\n \\n PART II. \\n \\n EXERCISES IN BEADING AND DECLAMATION. \\n \\n Abou Ben Adhem Leigh Hunt. 459 \\n \\n Account Current Anonym ous. 374 \\n \\n Aclams and Jefferson , Wirt. 369 \\n \\n Alexander\\'s Feast Dry den. 403 \\n \\n An Address to a Young Student Knox. 372 \\n \\n Annabel Lee Edgar A .

Na- \\n ture has so constituted him, that \\n both body and mind require \\n daily exercise to develope their \\n powers, and maintain them in a \\n vigorous and healthy condition. \\n The truth of this remark is \\n manifest from constant observation and experience — those \\n who lead active, bustling lives, conjoined with temperance \\n and prudence, commonly possess robust frames, and healthy \\n constitutions; while the sedentary and the indolent are \\n enervated and sickly. \\n \\n We find the same results from the exercise of the mental \\n faculties. He whose mind is constantly employed in the \\n acquisition of knowledge, usually retains his mental facul- \\n ties unimpaired to the last. But not so with the man of ease \\n and indolence. After the meridian of life, the powers of his \\n mind, with those of the body, become weaker, and weaker, \\n and he finally leaves the world as he entered it — a child. \\n \\n The health and strength of the body, therefore, mainly \\n depend on the number of muscles that are frequently called \\n into action, and the degree of rational exercise through \\n which they pass. Now there are few, if any, whose daily \\n avocations are so varied as to bring into requisition all the \\n muscles of the body : hence the necessity of gymnastic exer- \\n cises. \\n \\n The term, gymnastics, in its widest sense, signifies all \\n bodily exercises ; in a more limited sense, \" exercises syste- \\n matically adapted to develope the physical powers, and pre- \\n serve them in perfection, which constitutes the art of gym* \\n nasties properly so called.\" \\n \\n («) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 12 (#22) ##############################################\\n\\n12 INTRODUCTION. \\n \\n These exercises, when commenced in youth, develope the \\n muscles, give agility to the limbs, and promote the various \\n mnctions of the animal system: in this way they impart \\n strength and consistency to the body, and lay the founda- \\n tion of lasting health : and even when commenced in man- \\n hood, they invigorate the frame, and brace it against the \\n infirmities of age. \\n \\n By the frequent and energetic exercise of the muscles, \\n they are brought completely under the control of volition, \\n which is a powerful auxiliary to every variety of action. \\n Hence Gymnastics are not only useful because they exert a \\n healthful influence upon the body ; but because they lay a \\n good foundation for the easy acquisition of every mechanic \\n art. \\n \\n From what has been said of Gymnastics in general, it may \\n readily be conceived that very important advantages may \\n be derived from vocal gymnastics. \\n \\n By the term, Vocal Gymnastics, may be understood the \\n principles of the human voice as employed in speech and \\n song, as well as the training of the organs by which this \\n voice is produced. The principles are the science of the \\n voice — the training, the exercise of the organs, necessary \\n to develope their powers, and enable them to act with rapid- \\n ity, precision, and effect. \\n \\n Vocal Gymnastics give the pupil complete command of \\n the muscles of articulation, extend the compass of the voice, \\n and render it smooth, powerful, and melodious. They not \\n only call forth all the energies of the vocal organs, correct \\n stammering, lisping, &c. ; but they invigorate the lungs, and, \\n consequently, fortify them against the invasion of disease. \\n \\n All the blood, in the course of its circulation, passes through \\n the lungs, where it undergoes a change, not only essential \\n to health, but also to life. Whenever their function, there- \\n fore, is interrupted by debility, or disease, the blood is dete- \\n riorated, and the whole system suffers; in fact, the very \\n citadel of life is sapped, and nothing but a restoration of \\n these organs to their natural condition, will effect a return \\n of general health. Indeed, the lungs are of so much impor- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 13 (#23) ##############################################\\n\\nINTRODUCTION. 13 \\n \\n tance in the animal economy, that the complete suspension \\n of their office is followed by speedy dissolution. \\n \\n Hence such healthful measures should be adopted as are \\n calculated to invigorate the pulmonary apparatus, and ena- \\n ble it to maintain its integrity. One of the most kopefu! \\n expedients for this purpose, is a well-regulated and perse- \\n vering course of vocal gymnastics. \\n \\n Were we to exercise our voices a few minutes, every day, \\n according to just principles, the number of deaths from pul- \\n monary affections, especially consumption, I have no doubt, \\n would be greatly diminished. \\n \\n While Vocal Gymnastics give a keenness to appetite, they \\n are a powerful means of promoting digestion. A young \\n clergyman entered my Vocal Gymnasium, for the purpose \\n of improving his elocution as well as his health. He laboured \\n under dyspepsia which was attended with loss of appetite, \\n general debility, languor, and dejection of spirits. But in \\n twelve days after he commenced the exercises, there was a \\n radical change in his mental and physical condition : he had \\n become very cheerful ; and, to use his own words, his appe- \\n tite was ravenous. Nor is this a solitary case — numerous \\n others might be cited with the like happy result. \\n \\n My pupils have frequently told me that they always feel \\n invigorated by the exercises. A gentleman who was for- \\n merly a pupil of mine, and who had been in the practice of \\n resorting to a common gymnasium for the benefit of his \\n health, assured me that he derived more advantage from his \\n vocal, than from his athletic exercises. Let the individuals, \\n therefore, who visit those gymnasia, designed only for the \\n exercise of the limbs, not neglect the equally important \\n gymnastics of the pulmonary organs. \\n 2 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 14 (#24) ##############################################\\n\\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. \\n \\n As Elocution is intimately connected with the voice, and \\n as every reader may not be prepared to enter upon a minute \\n development of its various principles, the following Prelimi- \\n nary Observations may be of some advantage. \\n \\n Voice is sound, produced by the agitation of air when \\n forcibly expelled from the lungs. \\n \\n The attributes of the voice, are general and special. The \\n general attributes are pitch and force, and are common to \\n all voices. The special attributes are those peculiarities \\n which render one voice more agreeable, or disagreeable, \\n than another, as sweetness, harshness, &c. \\n \\n The acuteness and gravity of the voice depend on the \\n contractions and dilatations of the vocal tube. \\n \\n The degree of loudness of the voice, is in proportion to the \\n expulsive effort, and to the resistance which the air meets \\n on its passage through the glottis. \\n \\n When air is forcibly expelled from the lungs, and not suf- \\n ficient resistance given to its egress to produce what is gene- \\n rally understood by the term voice, an aspirated, or whis- \\n pered sound is the result. \\n \\n From voice articulated by the motions of the lips, tongue, \\n and other parts of the mouth, is produced oral language. \\n Hence oral language is not inaptly termed articulated voice. \\n \\n There are two varieties of oral language — song, and speech. \\n In several respects they resemble each other. Thus the \\n notes, both of song, and speech, vary in pitch, force, and \\n time. The most striking difference between them, is this : \\n a note of song is maintained in one range of pitch from its \\n commencement to its termination ; but a note of speech is \\n varied in pitch during its prolongation. If you prolong the \\n letter a, in one range of pitch, thus: \\n \\n a \\n \\n you will have an example of a note of song. If you utter it \\n interrogatively, and affirmatively, thus : \\n \\n a 1 d. \\n \\n you will have two varieties of the note of speech : the voice \\n in the interrogation, moving from a grave pitch to one more \\n acute ; in the affirmation, from acute to grave. \\n \\n Perhaps enough has been said by way of preliminaries. \\n The principles here mentioned, together with the various \\n others, are methodically presented, fully discussed, and dia- \\n gramically illustrated, in the course of the work. \\n \\n (14) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 15 (#25) ##############################################\\n\\nELOCUTIOiN. \\n \\n LOCUTION is vocal delivery. \\n It may be said to comprise both a \\n science, and an art. The science \\n embraces the principles which con- \\n stitute the basis of reading and \\n speaking ; the art, the practical ap- \\n plication of these principles. \\n Elocution is naturally divided into two parts ; namely, \\n Vocal Gymnastics, and Gesture. \\n \\n Vocal Gymnastics is the philosophy of the human \\n voice, as well as the art of training the vocal organs \\n in speech and song. \\n \\n Gesture is the various postures, and motions, em- \\n ployed in vocal delivery. \\n \\n PART I. \\n VOCAL GYMNASTICS. \\n \\n OCAL GYMNASTICSisthe \\n \\n philosophy of the human voice, \\n as well as the art of training \\n the vocal organs, in speech and \\n song. \\n \\n Vocal Gymnastics is subdi- \\n vided as follows : \\n \\n 1. Articulation, 3. Force, \\n \\n 2. Pitch, 4. Time. \\n Articulation is the act of forming, with the organs \\n \\n of speech, the elements of vocal language. \\n \\n Pitch is the degree of the elevation of sounds. \\n \\n (15) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 16 (#26) ##############################################\\n\\n16 \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n Force is the degree of the loudness of sounds. \\n Time is the measure of sounds in regard to \\n duration. \\n \\n theu \\n \\n SECTION L \\n \\n ARTICULATION. \\n \\n RTICULATIONistheactof \\n \\n forming, with the organs of speech, \\n the elements of vocal language. \\n \\n These elements may be formed \\n separately, as in the utterance of \\n the letters of the alphabet, as \\n well as conjunctively, as in the \\n pronunciation of words. \\n By the utterance of the letters of the alphabet is not meant the \\n \\n pronunciation of the mere names of the letters, but the formation \\n \\n of the various sounds which the letters represent. \\n \\n A good articulation is the perfect utterance of the \\n elements of vocal language. \\n \\n The first step towards becoming a good elocutionist, \\n is a correct articulation. \" A public speaker, possessed \\n of only a moderate voice, if he articulates correctly, \\n will be better understood, and heard with greater \\n pleasure, than one who vociferates without judgment. \\n The voice of the latter may indeed extend to a conside- \\n rable distance, but the sound is dissipated in confusion. \\n Of the former voice not the smallest vibration is wast- \\n ed, every stroke is perceived at the utmost distance to \\n which it reaches ; and hence it has often the appear- \\n ance of penetrating even farther than one which is \\n loud, but badly articulated. \\n \\n \" In just articulation, the words are not to be hurried \\n over, nor precipitated syllable over syllable ; nor, as it \\n were, melted together into a mass of confusion : they \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 17 (#27) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 17 \\n \\n should not be trailed, or drawled, nor permitted to slip \\n out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They should \\n be delivered from the lips as beautiful coins newly \\n issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, \\n neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, in due \\n succession, and of due weight.\"* \\n \\n Without good articulation, it is impossible to be & \\n correct reader, or speaker. Those who have been ac \\n customed to pronounce their words in a careless or slo- \\n venly manner, will find it difficult, even with their \\n best efforts, to utter them distinctly. The organs of \\n articulation, for the want of proper exercise, become, \\n as it were, paralyzed. The pupil, therefore, at the \\n very commencement of his studies, should be conduct- \\n ed through a series of exercises, calculated to strengthen \\n the muscles of articulation, and render them obedient \\n to the will. The best method for effecting these pur- \\n poses, is to exercise the voice on the elements of speech ; \\n first, on each element separately ; f secondly, on va- \\n rious combinations. \\n \\n Under the head, Practical Elocution, will be found a variety \\n of Exercises on the Elements of the English language, which are \\n calculated to develope the voice, increase its compass, and give \\n flexibility to the muscles of articulation. In that part of this work \\n which consists of Exercises in Reading and Declamation, most \\n of the sounds liable to be omitted or imperfectly articulated, are re* \\n presented by italic letters. Hence the reader, if he pay proper \\n attention to the subject, will have no difficulty in correcting all \\n ordinary defects in his utterance. \\n \\n The value of vocal gymnastics cannot be duly appreciated by \\n those who have not experienced, or witnessed, their beneficial re- \\n eults. But, I feel confident, the time is not far distant when these \\n exercises will be considered, by all intelligent persons, an essential \\n part of primary instruction. \\n \\n * Austin\\'s Chironomia, p. 37, 38. \\n \\n f \" When the elements are pronounced singly, they may re- \\n ceive a concentration of the organic effort, which gives them a \\n clearness of sound and a definite outline, if I may so speak, at their \\n extremes, that make a fine preparative for a distinct and forcible \\n pronunciation in the compounds of speech.\" — Rush\\'s Philosophy \\n of the Human Voice. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 18 (#28) ##############################################\\n\\n18 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n CHAPTER I. \\n \\n THE ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. \\n \\n The Elements of vocal language are the Sounds of \\n which words are composed. These sounds are repre- \\n sented by graphic characters, called letters. \\n \\n The number of letters in the English language, is \\n twenty-six ; but the number of elements is thirty-eight. \\n Hence, as the number of elements exceeds the number \\n of their literal signs, the same letter is employed, in \\n different situations, to represent different sounds. Thus \\n a represents four different sounds ; e, two ; i, two ; o, \\n three ; u, three ; z, two ; and there are six sounds, each \\n of which is represented by two letters — ou, ng, sh, wh, \\n ih in then, and th in thin. (See p. 19 and 20.) If we \\n had a perfect alphabet, every elementary sound would \\n be represented by its appropriate character.* \\n \\n * That men have accomplished much by furnishing the world \\n with literature, art, and science, will be conceded by all. Nor will \\n it be denied by any that there remains much to be done to carry all \\n human institutions to their acme of excellence. Among- the nu- \\n merous proofs that our institutions have not attained their highest \\n possible degree of perfection, is the fact that the world is now fur- \\n nished with as much genius for contrivance, wisdom for invention, \\n and judgment for application, as at any former period. He, there- \\n fore, who advocates the doctrine of present perfection in human \\n productions, suggests, at least, the possibility that that amount of \\n mind which is unnecessary to the successful application of the pre- \\n sent principles, means, and inventions to their respective purposes, \\n is rendered a redundancy by the want, of appropriate subjects upon \\n which to operate. The English language, though by no means far \\n advanced in years, has already been the subject of much concur- \\n rent, and individual action ; yet there is hardly one part of it which \\n is not marred with defect, or deficiency. Even the English alpha- \\n bet suffers from both these imperfections. To attain perfection in \\n any thing, is, perhaps, beyond the power of man, especially in the \\n medium of communicating his ideas. But although perfection in lan- \\n guage can hardly be expected, yet, there is a degree of excellence \\n which is not so difficult of attainment as to render all exertion una- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 19 (#29) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 19 \\n \\n The elements, as well as the letters by which they \\n are represented, are usually divided into two classes. \\n Vowels and Consonants. A more philosophical divi- \\n sion, however, is into three classes, Vowels, Subvowels, \\n and Aspirates. \\n \\n The vowels are pure vocal sounds ; their number is \\n fifteen. \\n \\n The subvowels have a vocality, but inferior to that \\n of the vowels ; their number is fourteen. \\n \\n The aspirates are made with the whispering breath, \\n and, consequently, have no vocality ; they are nine in \\n number. \\n \\n Classification of the Elements, \\n \\n VOWELS.

There is, then, a deficiency in our alphabet \\n of twelve letters — and he who shall supply this imperfection, will \\n be one of the greatest benefactors of the human race. This work \\n must be done before our orthography can be rendered consistent, \\n our pronunciation natural and uniform, and our language easy of \\n acquisition. Until this is accomplished, words must be spelled one \\n way, and pronounced another — indeed, two languages must be \\n learned, instead of one. Should the English language, as some \\n confidently expect, become the language of the world, the advan- \\n tages in which a complete alphabet would result, can be conceived \\n by those only who have duly reflected upon the subject. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 20 (#30) ##############################################\\n\\n20 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n ITUBVOWELS.

SHI \\n \\n CHAPTER II. \\n \\n THE VOWELS. \\n \\n The vowels are divided into Monothongs, Diph \\n thongs, and Triphthongs. \\n \\n The Monothongs consist of one kind of sound through- \\n out their concrete movement, and consequently are \\n simple elements ; they are represented by the italics in \\n the following words : \\n \\n arm, all, an, eve, end, in, on, up, full. \\n \\n The Diphthongs consist of two vowel sounds, which \\n coalesce so intimately that they appear like one uni- \\n form sound ; they are represented by the italics in the \\n following words : \\n \\n ale, He, lose, tube. \\n \\n The diphthong a, as well as 1, has a characteristic \\n sound for its radical, and the monothong, f, for its van- \\n ish.

SH is nearly the same sound as z in \\n azure, aspirated. \\n \\n T is formed by pressing the tip of the tongue against \\n the gums of the upper incisory teeth, and then aspirat- \\n ing the vowel u.* \\n \\n When T is doubled, as in attempt, the first T is mute. \\n \\n TH, as in thin, like th in then, is formed with the \\n tip of the tongue pressed against the upper incisory \\n teeth. It is nearly the same sound as the subvowel \\n TH aspirated. \\n \\n WH is the inceptive part of the vowel u aspirated \\n in a particular way. The sound which is produced, \\n in the formation of this element, is nearly the same as \\n hu, whispered. WH requires the same posture of the \\n mouth that the vowel u requires. \\n \\n That hu and wh are n t identical, may be proved by pronounc- \\n ing-, alternately, the wo Js hoom and whoom, and observing the \\n contrast between them. \\n \\n * Although of no practical importance, it may not be uninterest- \\n ing to the philosophic reader to know that the second constituent \\n of the subvowels B, D, G, and of the aspirates, K, P, T, is formed \\n by aspirating the vowel u only when these elements are uttered \\n singly, when they are final, and when they are followed by a con- \\n sonant. When they are followed by a vowel, their second consti- \\n tuent is formed by aspirating that vowel. This may be rendered \\n obvious by pronouncing forcibly, and deliberately, the words, Bay, \\n Day, Gay, and Kay, Pay, Tay, or any other words, in which B, D, \\n G, and K, P, T are followed by vowels. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 27 (#37) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 27 \\n \\n CHAPTER V. \\n \\n THE POSTURES OF THE MOUTH. \\n \\n An accurate knowledge of the positions which the \\n organs of articulation should assume in the formation \\n of the several elements of vocal language, is very im- \\n portant to those who would speak with ease and ele- \\n gance. To aid the reader still further in the acquisi- \\n tion of this knowledge, he is furnished with the various \\n postm^es of the mouth, required in uttering the elements \\n energetically, and singly. \\n \\n The elements are grouped according to the posture \\n in which the mouth should be when they are formed. \\n It will be seen that the Diphthongs and Triphthongs \\n have each two postures of the mouth — one at the \\n commencement, the other at the termination of the sound. \\n \\n These postures are, of course, more or less modified, \\n when the elements are uttered in their various combi- \\n nations, and with different degrees of force. \\n \\n The pupil should exercise his organs of speech, in the \\n most forcible manner, three times a week, and, if pos- \\n sible, even every day, on all the elements. The vow- \\n els should be exploded from the throat, both interroga- \\n tively and affirmatively, in every range of pitch within \\n the compass of the voice, and with every possible de- \\n gree of force. \\n \\n The vowels are exploded in the following manner : \\n make a full inspiration, close the glottis, and contract \\n the muscles of expiration so as to condense the air in \\n the lungs, then utter the element with a sudden and \\n forcible emission of the breath. The sounds thus pro- \\n duced may be denominated vocal thunder; the effect \\n upon an audience is electrical. \\n \\n This exercise strengthens the vocal organs, and ena- \\n bles the speaker to be heard at a great distance, with \\n very little effort, or expenditure of breath. It is also \\n beneficial to health. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 28 (#38) ##############################################\\n\\n28 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 29 (#39) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. \\n \\n 29 \\n \\n how \\n m ind \\n 2?it \\n \\n ale \\n \\n ale \\n \\n old \\n our \\n \\n lose \\n \\n twbe \\n \\n J \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 30 (#40) ##############################################\\n\\n30 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n CHAPTER VI. \\n \\n DEFECTIVE ARTICULATION. \\n \\n Articulation is defective when one o~ more ele» \\n ments of a word are omitted, or imperfectly formed ; or \\n when one element is substituted for another. \\n \\n Defective articulation is exceedingly common : per- \\n haps there is not one individual in ten thousand whose \\n articulation is perfect. This arises from the neglect of \\n a proper gymnastic training of the organs of speech in \\n childhood. As soon as children are capable of imitating \\n sounds, they should be taught the elements of vocal \\n language ; and, to facilitate their acquisition of this \\n knowledge, they should be made to exercise before a \\n mirror, so as to compare the movements of their own \\n lips with those of the lips of their instructor. By pur- \\n suing this course, a good foundation will be laid for a \\n perfect and graceful articulation. \\n \\n In that part of this work which consists of Exercises \\n in Reading and Declamation, all, or nearly all, the \\n letters representing sounds liable to be omitted, or im- \\n perfectly articulated, are italicised. Hence it. is not \\n necessary to furnish examples, and treat of the subject \\n minutely, in this place. There are, however, some in- \\n stances of defective articulation, which are not pointed \\n out by the italic letters — these are so important that \\n they deserve special notice. I allude to those cases in \\n which one element is substituted for another. The \\n remainder of this chapter will be devoted to their con- \\n sideration. \\n \\n Children are apt to substitute the sound of d for that \\n of g in gay ; and the sound of t for that of k, or c in \\n cat. Thus, for gay, they say day ; for cake, tate, &c. \\n \\n To enable the pupil to correct these faults, I explain \\n to him the manner in which the sounds of g and k are \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 31 \\n \\n produced — they are formed by pressing the root of \\n the tongue against the soft palate, and not, like d and \\n t by pressing its tip against the gums of the upper \\n incisors. I then direct him to pronounce, after me, the \\n elements, d, g, and t, k, and the syllables da, ga, and \\n ta, ka, thus : \\n \\n d, g; d,g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g. \\n \\n da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; de, ge ; de, ge ; &e. \\n ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; te, ke ; te, ke ; &c. \\n \\n The object of this exercise is to contrast the substituted \\n sound with the correct one. \\n \\n When this plan does not prove successful, I open my \\n mouth as widely as possible, so that the tip of the \\n tongue cannot touch the gums of the upper teeth, and \\n request the pupil to open his in like manner. I then \\n direct him to pronounce, after me, the following sylla- \\n bles: \\n \\n ga, ga, ga, ga ; ge, ge ; gl, gl ; go, gd, gb ; gu, gu, gu ; gou. \\n ka, ka, ka, ka ; ke, ke ; kl, kl ; ko, k6, k& ; ku, ku, ku ; kou. \\n ag, eg, Ig, 6g, ug, oug; ak, ek, Ik, 6k, ftk, ouk. \\n \\n When neither of these schemes proves successful, I \\n request the pupil to press his tongue downwards, and \\n backwards, with his index finger, while I do the same, \\n and pronounce, after me, the syllables in the preceding \\n exercise. This I have never known to fail. \\n \\n Some children omit the element z, when it follows d, \\n and the element sh when it follows t ; for instance, they \\n pronounce John, don, and Charles, tarles, &c. # My \\n method of correcting these defects is to contrast the \\n false pronunciation with the true one, as in the follow- \\n ing exercise : \\n \\n dia, d2a; da, dSa; da, d2a; da, dJa; de, die; &c. \\n \\n ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; te, tshe ; &c. \\n \\n * J is a compound of d and z in azure ; and ch is equivalent to \\n Uh. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################\\n\\n32 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n The v and w are confounded by some perons ; for \\n instance, when they would say vine, they say wine, and \\n vice versa. An attention to the proper postures of the \\n mouth, in the production of these elements will soon \\n enable the pupil to correct this fault.* (See pos- \\n tures of the mouth, page 28.) The following exercise, \\n founded on the principle of contrast, should be fre- \\n quently practised by the pupil, in the most energetic \\n manner. \\n \\n va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; ve, we ; ve, we ; &c. \\n \\n wa, va; wa, va; wa, va; wa, va ; we, ve ; we, ve ; &c. \\n \\n In correcting faults in articulation, I often find it \\n advantageous to exercise the pupil before a mirror, that \\n he may observe the contrast between the movements \\n of his own mouth, and those of mine. \\n \\n LISPING. \\n \\n Lisping is the substitution of the sound of th for that \\n of some other letter, generally for that of s in sin. \\n Thus the words, sale, send, sight, song, &c, are pro- \\n nounced thale, thend, thight, thong, &c. \\n \\n The lisper should be told, that, in forming the sound \\n of th, the tip of the tongue is pressed gently against \\n the inner surface of the upper incisor teeth ; whereas, \\n in forming that of s, it is placed, in like manner, against \\n the gums of the upper incisor teeth. Hence, to avoid \\n making th for s, the tongue should be drawn back a \\n little, and its point turned upward against the gums of \\n the upper teeth. In the correction of lisping, the fol- \\n owing exercise may be practised with advantage : \\n \\n tha, sa ; tM, sa ; tha, sa ; tha, sa ; the, se ; the, the ; &c. \\n \\n * A young; gentleman recently entered my institution who had \\n many faults in his utterance. Among- others was the sing-ular one \\n of pronouncing; vw for v: for vine, he said vwine; for vale, vwaJe, \\n &c. This, as well as the other numerous faults with wn.ich his \\n pronunciation was marred, arose from the want of proper instruc- \\n tion upon the use of the organs of speech. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 33 (#43) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 33 \\n \\n The defects of articulation, in which one element \\n (S substituted for another, are numerous ; but, as the \\n method of treatment is similar in all, it is presumed \\n enough has been said to enable the teacher to manage \\n them successfully, particularly as appropriate exer- \\n cises, for most of them, will be found in the practical \\n part of this work. \\n \\n CHAPTER VII. \\n \\n STAMMERING. \\n \\n Stammering is a functional derangement of the or- \\n gans of speech, which renders them incapable, under \\n certain circumstances, of promptly obeying the com- \\n mands of the will. \\n \\n In a majority of cases, the cause of this affection \\n operates through the medium of the mind. \\n \\n Stammering is cured by a regular course of hygienic \\n elocution. But, as the disease exists under a variety \\n of forms, it requires a variety of treatment. And, as \\n the treatment is medico-elocutional, he who would \\n apply it successfully, must unite the skill of the elocu- \\n tionist with that of the physician. The idea that non- \\n medical men are capable of discharging the duties of \\n applying the remedies to complicated complaints of \\n the human body, is a sui generis in logic, and a bane \\n in the practice of the healing art. \\n \\n As a full consideration of the subject of stammering \\n is not compatible with the design of this work ; and, as \\n I am preparing for publication another which will \\n treat exclusively of impediments of speech, I shall con- \\n clude the present chapter with the following \\n \\n Remarks on Stammering , from a Lecture on Elocution \\n delivered before the American Lyceum, May 6, 1837, \\n by Andrew Comstock, M.D. \\n \\n For the last ten years the author of these remarks has \\n been engaged in an investigation of the philosophy of the \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 34 (#44) ##############################################\\n\\n34 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n human voice, with a view to the formation of a system of \\n just Elocution, and to the discovery of the true means for \\n removing impediments of speech in stammerers. How far \\n he has succeeded in his attempt, is not for him to say. His \\n system is the result of his own reflection and experience ; \\n and, as it is founded in philosophy, it is the only true system. \\n The following pages contain the mere outlines of the system. \\n The work itself will be presented to the public as soon as \\n the author\\'s other labours will permit. \\n \\n Stammering or stuttering is a hesitation or interruption of speech, \\n and is usually attended with more or less distortion of feature. \\n This affection presents itself under a variety of forms ; but my limits \\n will not allow me to give a particular description of them. I will \\n notice only the most striking. \\n \\n In some cases, the stammerer makes an effort to speak, and all \\n his breath is expelled without producing vocality ; in others, the \\n lips are spasmodically closed : — these two forms often occur in the \\n game case. Sometimes the stammerer, while speaking or reading, \\n loses all power over the vocal organs, and remains some momenta \\n with his mouth open, before he can recover sufficient energy to \\n proceed. In many cases, the stammerer repeats the word imme- \\n diately preceding the one he is attempting to pronounce, or he re- \\n peats, in a rapid manner, the first element, or the first syllable, of \\n the difficult word. \\n \\n Causes. — The predisposing causes are nervous irritability and \\n delicacy of constitution. \\n \\n The most usual exciting causes are diffidence, embarrassment, a \\n fear of not being successful when about to make an effort to speak, \\n an attempt to speak faster than the vocal organs can assume the \\n proper positions for utterance. Two or more of these causes often \\n occur in the same case. Sometimes the habit of stammering is \\n acquired by imitation. \\n \\n The proximate cause of stammering is a spasmodic action of the \\n muscles of speech. \\n \\n Prognosis. — The probability of a cure depends upon the follow- \\n ing circumstances: If the stammerer has a cheerful disposition, is \\n distinguished for energy of mind and decision of character, can ap- \\n preciate the variations of pitch in speech and song, or, in other \\n words, has an ear for music and a taste for elocution, the prognosis \\n is favourable. But if he is of a nervous temperament, subject to \\n melancholy, irresolute of purpose, incapable of imitation in speaking \\n and singing, the prognosis is unfavourable. \\n \\n Treatment. — The stammerer should be impressed with the \\n importance, nay, necessity, of giving exclusive attention to the sub- \\n ject ; and he should not be allowed to converse with any one till \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 35 (#45) ##############################################\\n\\nARTICULATION. 3o \\n \\n he can speak without stammering 1 . These rules cannot be too \\n strongly enforced. I am fully persuaded of this from my own ex- \\n perience. Several stammerers, who have placed themselves under \\n my care, taking but two or three lessons a week, and attending to \\n their usual avocations, have left me disappointed ; while those who \\n have given undivided attention to the subject, have been entirely \\n relieved. True, many are more or less benefited even by occasion \\n ally taking a lesson ; but it is very difficult, by any irregular course, \\n to effect a radical cure. The habit of stammering should be ar- \\n rested at once ; for, while it is continued, how is it possible that the \\n habit of speaking correctly can be established 1 \\n \\n Great pains should be taken to inspire the stammerer with confi- \\n dence. He should be convinced that his success depends mainly \\n upon his own exertions : that he must pursue the various exercises \\n assigned him with indefatigable zeal, with untiring industry; that \\n he has the same organs of speech as other people, and nothing is \\n necessary to enable him to use them as well, but a conviction in his \\n ability to do so. To think that one can do, gives almost the ability \\n to accomplish — but to think that one cannot do, virtually takes \\n away the ability to do, even where it is ample. \\n \\n Stammering is often continued by the subordinate estimation \\n which the stammerer puts upon himself. He is too apt to consider \\n those around him giants, and himself a dwarf. As this estimation \\n of himself serves to perpetuate his disease, it is clear that its reme- \\n dy must be found in making himself equal to any: if this mental \\n classification into giants and dwarfs must take place, let the stam- \\n merers make themselves the giants, and those around them the \\n dwarfs. \\n \\n The teacher should study the disposition of his pupil : he should \\n persuade him to banish from his mind all melancholy thoughts — \\n in short, he should do every thing in his power to render his pupil \\n cheerful and happy. \\n \\n Various athletic exercises should be resorted to daily, to invigo- \\n rate all the muscles of voluntary motion, and diminish nervous irri- \\n tability. In some cases it may be necessary to have recourse to \\n tonics, anti-spasmodics, bathing in salt water, frictions over the \\n whole surface of the body, &c, &c. Electricity may be used with \\n advantage as a tonic, and also as a means of interrupting the spasm \\n of the vocal organs. \\n \\n The vocal treatment is deduced from the following circum \\n stances : \\n \\n 1. An ability to sing. \\n \\n 2. An ability to speak when alone : \\n \\n 3. And if the stammerer must speak before an audience, the \\n smaller the audience and the farther he is removed from it, the \\n better. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################\\n\\n36 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n 4. An ability to speak amidst a noise that is sufficient to render \\n the human voice nearly or quite inaudible. \\n \\n 5. An ability to speak better in the dark than in the light. \\n b\\\\ An ability to speak in a measured manner. \\n \\n 7. An ability to speak in a drawling manner. \\n \\n 8. An ability to speak with the mouth more or less distorted. \\n \\n 9. An ability to speak in any key, either higher or lower than \\n that in which the stammerer usually converses. \\n \\n 10. An ability to speak with a halloo. \\n \\n 11. An ability to speak when the attention is divided or arrested \\n by some object or circumstance more or less irrelevant to the sub- \\n ject. \\n \\n 12. An ability to speak in concert or simultaneously. Every one \\n who has learned to sing, knows how much easier it is to sing in \\n concert than alone. All the exercises, therefore, for the cure of \\n stammering, should, at first, be conducted in concert. \\n \\n Stammering may be considered a fault in elocution, the result of \\n defective education, and is confirmed by habit. If children were \\n properly instructed in .speaking and reading, this affection of the \\n vocal organs would probably, seldom or never occur. Hence, no \\n mode of treatment that is not founded in just elocution or the cor- \\n rect exercise of the organs of speech for the purposes of vocal ex- \\n pression, can be relied on. This must appear obvious to every in- \\n telligent and reflecting mind. The stammerer must be taught how \\n to give language the pitch, time, and force which the sense requires. \\n To effect this, his muscles of speech, which have long been refrac- \\n tory, must be trained till they are brought under the control of \\n volition, and like a well-marshalled troop of soldiers, made to act in \\n harmonious concert. \\n \\n Oral language may be resolved into certain sounds which are its \\n elements. Now there are certain positions of the organs of speech \\n more favourable than others for the production of the elements. \\n The stammerer should be made thoroughly acquainted with these \\n positions, and, in connexion with them, should be required to exer- \\n cise his voice in the most energetic manner upon all the elements \\n singly, till he can utter them without hesitation. He should also \\n utter them in various combinations, not only according to the laws \\n of syllabication, but in every irregular way. The vowels should \\n be exploded from the throat with great force ; and they should be \\n sung, as well as pronounced with the rising and falling inflection, \\n through every interval of pitch within the compass of the voice. \\n \\n The pupil should be drilled in various exercises whose highest \\n peculiarity is time and force.

When, therefore, the stammerer becomes master of these \\n elements, as well as the elements of the language, he may com- \\n mence speaking and reading. In his first attempts at conversation, \\n Doth teacher and pupil should speak in a deliberate manner, with a \\n full, firm tone of voice, and in a very low pitch. \\n \\n The stammerer should now commit to memory a short piece \\n which requires to be spoken with explosive force; for example, \\n \" Satan\\'s speech to his legions.\" The members of the class should \\n stand at a sufficient distance from each other to prevent their hands \\n coming in contact when their arms are extended. They should \\n then pronounce the speech in concert, after the teacher, and accom- \\n pany it with appropriate gesticulation. It should be repeated again \\n and again, till each pupil can give it proper expression, both as \\n regards voice and gesture. Each pupil should then, in turn, take \\n the place of the teacher and give out the speech to the class. To \\n prevent the pupil\\'s stammering, while he is performing the teach- \\n er\\'s part, the teacher himself should play an accompaniment on the \\n violoncello, violin, organ, drum, or some other instrument. At firsl \\n the notes should be made very loud ; but if the effort of the pupil, \\n standing out of the class, is likely to be successful, they should gra- \\n dually be made softer and softer, and, finally, the accompaniment \\n omitted altogether. This piece should be pronounced alternately \\n with one which requires to be spoken with long quantity and in a \\n low pitch, as \" Ossian\\'s Address to the Sun.\" \\n \\n When the pupil has mastered these two kinds of reading, he may \\n take up dignified dialogue, and, lastly, conversational pieces. He \\n should drawl out difficult words, which are generally those having \\n short vowels preceded by labials, dentals, and gutturals. \\n \\n In very bad cases of stammering, the pupil should first sing the \\n words, then drawl them, then pronounce them with very long quan- \\n tity, and thus gradually approximate to common speaking. \\n \\n As soon as the pupils can speak without stammering, they should \\n recite singly in a very large room, or in the open air, at a distance \\n from the audience, which, at first, should consist of the members of \\n the class only. A few visiters should be occasionally introduced, \\n and the number should be gradually increased. In this way the \\n stammerer will soon acquire sufficient confidence to speak before a \\n large assembly. In some cases it may be expedient for the stam- \\n merer to recite before an audience in a dark room ; but as he ac- \\n quires confidence, light should be gradually admitted. \\n \\n Stammerers, instead of speaking immediately after inspiration, as \\n they should do, often attempt to speak immediately after expiration, \\n when, of course, they have no power to speak. The lungs, like a \\n bellows, perform their part in the process of speaking, best, when \\n plentifully supplied with air. This is an important fact, and should \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 38 (#48) ##############################################\\n\\n38 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n be remembered, not only by stammerers, but also by those who nave \\n occasion to read or speak in public. Loud speaking - , long-continued, \\n with the lungs but partially distended, is very injurious to these \\n organs : it is apt to occasion a spitting of blood, v Men is not unfre- \\n quently a precursor of pulmonary consumption. But loud speaking, \\n with proper management of the breath, is a healthful exercise : be- \\n sides strengthening the muscles which it calls into action, it pro \\n motes the clecarbonization of the blood, and, consequently, exerts a \\n salutary influence on the system generally. [See additional re- \\n marks, in Appendix at the end of the volume, where will be found \\n an account of the new surgical operation for the radical cure of \\n stammering, which has been performed, with more or less success, \\n both in Europe and in this country.] \\n \\n SECTION II. \\n \\n PITCH. \\n \\n ITCH is the degree of the eleva- \\n tion of sounds. \\n \\n As pitch regards the elevation of sounds, \\n it respects their acuteness and gravity. I \\n /5 $f use the term pitch in its widest significa- \\n tion. — In the science of music, it is used \\n not only in the sense in which I employ it, \\n but it also has a special application : in the \\n latter, it is applied to the medium note, the regulating note to \\n which instruments are brought by the act of tuning. When ap- \\n plied in this sense, it is termed concert-pitch. The note which has \\n been adopted, by common consent, as the pitch-note, is A, the open \\n note of the second string of the violin : it is written in the second \\n space of the treble staff. \\n \\n A lax division of pitch is into high and low ; in other \\n words, into acute and grave ; (those notes being called \\n high, or acute, which are above the natural pitch of \\n the voice ; and those low, or grave, which are below it) \\n Strictly speaking, the application of high and low, to pitch, is \\n without philosophic foundation : it has originated, not from any \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 39 (#49) ##############################################\\n\\nPITCH. 39 \\n \\n principles in the acuteness and gravity of sound, but from the rela- \\n tive position of the notes in the graphic scale. This is obvious \\n from the fact that the degrees of the scale may be exemplified in a \\n horizontal line, by varying the forms of the graphic notes, as was \\n done by the Greeks. \\n \\n An exact division of pitch, as demonstrated by the \\n diatonic scale, is into tones and semitones.* \\n \\n The word tone, as here employed, signifies a certain degree of \\n difference in pitch between two notes, as that between the first and \\n second note of the scale. But in some cases we use the word tone, \\n as synonymous with note; for instance, in some persons the tones \\n oi the voice are more musical than in others — that is, the notes \\n of the voice. \\n \\n The diatonic scale consists of seven sounds, moving \\n discretely from grave to acute, or from acute to grave, \\n by different degrees of pitch, of which the semitone \\n may be the common measure, or divisor, without a \\n fraction. The scale, however, is not complete without \\n the octave, which is a repetition of the first note in the \\n eighth degree. \\n \\n The notes do not ascend by equal degrees of pitch, \\n but by tones and semitones ; the semitones occurring \\n between the third and fourth, and seventh and eighth. \\n The order of the scale, therefore, is as follows : two \\n tones and a semitone, three tones and a semitone. And \\n should it be desirable to extend the series of sounds, the \\n eighth note of the first octave will become the first note \\n of the second octave ; the eighth note of the second oc- \\n tave, the first note of the third, and so on. \\n \\n In teaching the pupil to \" raise and fall the eight \\n notes,\" as it is called, the monosyllables, Do, Re, Mi, \\n Fa, Sol, La, Si,f may be employed. \\n \\n Diag. 4 is a graphic representation of the scale.

This \\n point, in a majority of persons, is \\n about two octaves above the lowest \\n note of the voice. The natural voice \\n embraces all the notes below this \\n point ; the falsetto, all the notes above \\n it. (See Diag. 5.) \\n \\n The Italians call the natural voice voce di \\n petto, and the falsetto voice voce di testa ; f \\n because they suppose the former to come \\n from the chest, and the latter from the head. \\n This error has arisen from a want of anato- \\n mical and physiological knowledge of the \\n vocal organs. Voice is never formed in the \\n chest, or in the head : it is always formed in \\n the upper part of the larynx, at the aperture \\n of the glottis. It is, however, formed higher, \\n or lower in the throat, according to its de- \\n gree of acuteness, or gravity. At the command of the wi \\n larynx may be elevated, or depressed, and the aperture of the glot- \\n tis enlarged, or diminished. The larynx is the most depressed, and \\n the aperture of the glottis the most dilated, when the gravest sound \\n is formed ; and the larynx is the most elevated, and the aperture \\n \\n the \\n \\n * It is said that the ear is capable of perceiving nine octaves, \\n f Voce di petto (Ital.), voice from the breast.

From this circumstance, no \\n doubt, has arisen the error of calling the natural voice voce di petto, \\n and the falsetto voice voce di testa. \\n \\n The whispering voice does not, like the natural voice \\n and the falsetto, owe its peculiarity to pitch, but to the \\n absence of what is generally understood by the term \\n vocality. The compass of the whispering voice is about \\n an octave. My own extends through ten degrees of \\n the scale.* \\n \\n The natural pitch of the female voice is an octave \\n above that of the male voice. The pitch of the female \\n voice corresponds to that of the violin ; the pitch of the \\n male voice, to that of the violoncello. The voices of \\n boys are of the same pitch as the female voice — one \\n octave above a man\\'s voice. When boys are about the \\n age of fourteen, their voices undergo a change of pitch. \\n \\n The notes of the falsetto voice are called treble ; the \\n upper notes of the natural voice, tenor ; and the lower \\n notes of the natural voice, bass.-f (See Diag. 5.) \\n \\n The divisions of the voice, as given by Italian au- \\n thors, and adopted by many musicians of other coun- \\n tries, are as follows : \\n \\n \" There are three departments in the human voice, \\n viz., the high, the middle, and the low. These depart- \\n ments are in the female, as well as in the male voice. \\n Soprano, mezzo soprano, and contralto, are female voices. \\n Tenore, baritono, and basso, are male voices. \"J \\n \\n The reader will observe that the falsetto voice is not \\n included in the above division. \\n \\n To a bass, a baritone, and a contralto voice, natu- \\n \\n * Notes analogous to those of the whispering voice may be made \\n on the German flute, and some other wind instruments, through the \\n compass of an octave. \\n \\n f When I speak of the voice, I speak of the adult male voice, \\n unless otherwise stated. \\n \\n I Introduction to the Art and Science of Music, by Phil.

It ia \\n formed by dividing the whole tones of the diatonic scale into semi- \\n tones, by five additional sounds. The chromatic scale may be il- \\n lustrated by touching all the white and black keys of a piano-forte, \\n in their consecutive order. (The chromatic scale is represented by \\n No. 4, in Diag. 9.) \\n \\n The sounds which compose the diatonic scale, as I have said, are \\n named after the first seven letters of the alphabet. The five addi- \\n tional sounds, which, when added to the diatonic scale, divide it \\n into semitones, are called flats, or sharps, according as they receive \\n the names of the notes immediately below, or of those immediately \\n above them. Thus, the second note of the chromatic scale of C, is \\n called C sharp, or Dflat; the fourth is called D sharp, or Eflat; \\n the seventh, F sharp, or G flat ; the ninth, G sharp, or Aflat; \\n and the eleventh, A sharp, or Bflat.

This first note is called the key- \\n note, .\\' fundamental note, or tonic. As each note of the diatonic \\n scat; ( \\' C (see No. 1), as well as its sharp and flat (see No. 4), \\n may <.y-, assumed as a key-note of a series of seven, it follows that \\n there are twenty-one major, and twenty-one minor keys. And as \\n eaci» note of the diatonic scale of C, as well as its sharp and flat, \\n may also be assumed as a key-note of a chromatic series, it follows \\n thai there are twenty-one keys in the chromatic genus. These, \\n ••added to the forty-two keys in the diatonic genus, make the whole \\n number of keys in the musical system amount to sixty-three. Still, \\n as there are but twelve notes, there can be but thirty-six scales ; \\n and even this number may be resolved into three — one major, one \\n minor, and one chromatic; all the others are transpositions of the \\n three primitive scales into different ranges of pitch. \\n \\n The speaking voice, in good elocution, seldom rises \\n higher than a fifth above the lowest note of its com- \\n pass.

Acuto-grave circumflex ( A ). \\n \\n Falling inflection ( l ). Gravo-acute circumflex (v). \\n Acuto-gravo-acute circumflex (/v). \\n Gravo-acuto-grave circumflex (v\\\\). \\n \\n In reading and speaking, each syllable has some one \\n of these inflections ; but, for practical purposes, it is \\n necessary to mark those only which are emphatic. \\n \\n The various movements of the voice, in song and speech, may be \\n explained in the following manner : \\n \\n When the bow is drawn across an open string of the violin, or \\n any of its species, a sound is produced of a uniform pitch, from be- \\n ginning to end. This sound is a pure note of music, and, so far as \\n pitch is concerned, is identical with a note of song. When the \\n bow is drawn across the same string, while the centre of the string \\n is pressed down with the finger, a sound is produced similar to that \\n of the open string, but an octave higher. The intermediate notes \\n of the diatonic scale may be produced by pressing down the string, \\n at the proper places, and drawing the bow across it. \\n \\n When a string of the violin is pressed down by the finger, and, \\n at the same time, the finger is made to slide upon it towards the \\n bridge of the instrument, during the drawing of the bow, a sound is \\n produced which gradually increases in acuteness from beginning \\n to end. When the finger is made to slide in the opposite direction, \\n during the drawing of the bow, a sound is produced which gradu- \\n ally increases in gravity during its prolongation. When the finger \\n is made to slide towards the bridge, and thence back again, during \\n the drawing of the bow, a simple circumflex note is produced. \\n When the finger is made to slide towards the bridge, thence back \\n again, and thence again towards the bridge, during the drawing of \\n the bow, a compound circumflex note is produced. \\n \\n Other varieties of the slide might be given, but these are suffi- \\n cient to answer the purpose of explanation. \\n \\n \"The slide is a grace of much simplicity and beauty, evidently \\n drawn from nature. It expresses the most tender and affectionate \\n emotions: we hear it in those little gusts of passion which mothers \\n use in caressing their infants: it is one of the most endearing tones \\n in the language of nature. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 49 (#59) ##############################################\\n\\nPITCH. 49 \\n \\n \" The portamento, or carriage of the voice, as the Italians term \\n it, is an easy mode of sliding from one tone to another. Hence \\n second-rate singers find it a convenient method of encountering \\n those notes which lie at remote and awkward distances. In some \\n voices it is so fixed, by habit, that two bars cannot be sung without \\n it. When so used, it utterly destroys every pretence to good sing- \\n ing, by interposing an effect of the most sickening kind ; when used \\n with discretion, it adds much to the force of expression ; and, in \\n Madame Caradori, it was a grace both tender and agreeable. \\n \\n \" The violinist, Paganini, the present wonder of the world, plays \\n an entire cantabile* upon one string, sliding through all the inter- \\n vals with a single finger — the effect of which is so plaintive, and \\n desolate, as to move his audience to tears. Velluti, the first singing- \\n master of the age, uses this grace with incomparable beauty; in his \\n voice it imparts a tenderness not to be described.\"! \\n \\n The sliding notes above described are analagous to drawling \\n notes of speech. Speech, to be natural, requires each syllable to \\n be uttered with a certain degree of force. This force is always in \\n proportion to the length of the syllable. A syllable is drawled \\n when it is pronounced with inadequate force — in other words, with \\n force less than that which constitutes the minimum degree of natu- \\n ral speech. \\n \\n The extent of the concrete intervals of the notes of \\n speech, is various under various circumstances. A \\n rising inflection may be carried through the whole \\n compass of the voice. But, in the most energetic in- \\n terrogation, the voice seldom rises higher than an oc- \\n tave; though sometimes it extends to a tenth, or a \\n twelfth. The smallest concrete interval does not, per \\n haps, exceed a quarter tone. \\n \\n The concrete intervals of rising inflections are \\n greater than those of their corresponding falling inflec- \\n tions. This may be illustrated by pronouncing the \\n letter a interrogatively and affirmatively, several times, \\n with increasing energy, making the intervals of each \\n succeeding pair greater than those of the preceding, as \\n shown by the following diagram : \\n \\n * Cantabile, a term applied to movements intended to be per \\n formed in a graceful, elegant, and melodious style. — Busby\\'s Die \\n lionary of Music. \\n \\n \\\\ Gardiner\\'s Music of Nature, p. 164-5, London edition. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 50 (#60) ##############################################\\n\\n50 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS, THROUGH VARIOU* \\n INTERVALS OF PITCH.

The term harmony, as employed in \\n the science of music, signifies a union of melodies, a succession of \\n combined sounds, moving at consonant intervals, according to the \\n laws of modulation.* \\n \\n Notation is the graphic representation of a melody — \\n in other words, the expression of a melody by written \\n characters. \\n \\n Intonation is the act of sounding the notes of a me- \\n lody, either with the voice, or an instrument. When \\n each note is produced in its proper degree of pitch, the \\n intonation is true ; when the intervals are not observed \\n with exactness, the intonation is false. Correct into- \\n nation, in speech, is highly important : in song, and in- \\n strumental music, it is indispensable; for, if the intona- \\n tion is false, melody loses its charms, and harmony \\n becomes discord. \\n \\n The melody of speech is founded on sense ; that of \\n song, generally, on sound. Words containing opposite \\n \\n * The term harmonious is correctly employed when applied to \\n two or more sounds whose union is consonant, or agreeable ; it is \\n incorrectly employed when applied to the notes of a single melody, \\n as is done by some authors, who confound it with the word melo \\n dious. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 53 (#63) ##############################################\\n\\nPITCH. 53 \\n \\n sentiments may be sung to the same air, with effects \\n equally good, if the force and time be properly varied. \\n Tnus, if the two songs, March to the Battle Field, and \\n Oft in the Stilly Night, be sung to the same air — the \\n former with great force, and in quick time — the latter \\n with diminished force, and in slow time, there will be \\n as much difference of expression between them as there \\n is between that of joy and sorrow.* But speech is not \\n so accommodating. Here every sentence must not \\n only have its appropriate tune, but the tune must be \\n properly pitched. \\n \\n The melody of song is graduated on a scale whose \\n degrees are as definite as those of the scale of Gunter. \\n But the melody of speech is not formed with such ma- \\n thematical exactness — it has no scale of determinate \\n degrees. Hence it is difficult to represent it graphi- \\n cally — to give to each note \\n \\n \"A local habitation and a name.\" \\n \\n But even if an exact notation of the melody of speech \\n should be given, it is doubtful whether it would be of \\n much practical importance to the generality of man- \\n kind, as none but a Paganini would be able to read it. \\n Such a notation, however, is a desideratum — it would \\n be highly interesting to the philosopher ; and I would \\n advise all elocutionists who have a good ear for music, \\n and can perform on stringed instruments of the violin \\n species, to direct their attention to the subject.f \\n \\n For practical purposes, however, it is not essential \\n to present every syllable in speech under its proper \\n note, as is done in song : it is only necessary to give a \\n notation of the relative pitch of the emphatic syllables. \\n \\n * The reader must not infer that I entertain the opinion that in \\n song- melody cannot be adapted to sentiment. I believe that if the \\n composers of music were elocutionists, they would always construct \\n their melodies with reference to the sentiments to be expressed. \\n \\n f Any essays on this subject by one who cannot perform on a \\n musical instrument, must u>-ove entirely abortive. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 54 (#64) ##############################################\\n\\nf>4 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n Such a notation may be read by those who have no \\n knowledge of music whatever, and, consequently, does \\n not require the aid of a Paganini. Besides, if the rela- \\n tive pitch of the heavy, or emphatic syllables, and their \\n inflections, are given, the light, or unemphatic sylla- \\n bles will naturally take their proper degrees of eleva- \\n tion. \\n \\n The series of notes by which the relative pitch, ana \\n inflections of the emphatic syllables are represented, \\n is denominated an emphasis melody. The emphasis \\n melodies are written on four horizontal, parallel lines. \\n These lines are called the staff of speech, in contradis- \\n tinction to the staffof music, which consists of five hori- \\n zontal, parallel lines, and the intermediate spaces. \\n \\n \"Ye are the things that tower, that shine, whose \\n smile makes glad, whose frown is terrible.\\'\\' \\n \\n In the above sentence there are four emphatic points, \\n which are represented by the following \\n \\n EXAMPLE OF EMPHASIS MELODY. (Diag. 12.) \\n \\n Staff of Speech.^ \\n \\n Pitch-Note Lino. \\n \\n tower, shine, glad, terrible. \\n \\n Each note in the above diagram has the falling inflec- \\n tion, and no two have the same radical pitch. There \\n is a gradual increase in the size of the notes from the \\n first to the last, which represents a gradual increase of \\n force, forming a sort of climax. \\n \\n In that part of this work which consists of Exer- \\n cises in Reading and Declamation, the notes of the \\n emphasis melodies are represented by graphic inflec- \\n tions placed at different degrees of elevation, thus: \\n \\n \" Ye are the things that tow er, that shine*, whose \\n smile makes glad\\', whose frown is terrible.\" \\n \\n In reading and speaking there is one note whicn \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 55 (#65) ##############################################\\n\\nPITCH. 55 \\n \\n predominates ; and in correct reading and speaking, the \\n pitch of this note is always in accordance with the \\n sentiment. This predominant, leading, or pitch-note \\n of speech, is written on the second line of the staff, \\n counting from below. To render the pitch-line con- \\n spicuous, it is made heavier than the other lines of the \\n staff. (See Diag. 12.) In the Exercises in Reading \\n and Declamation, the pitch-note is represented by the \\n graphic inflection which commences at the centre of \\n the body of the letter. (See the word shine, in the \\n foregoing example.) When one reads altogether in the \\n pitch-note, the reading is monotonous ; when the voice \\n is properly varied in pitch, it occasionally rises a de- \\n gree, or two degrees above, or descends a degree below \\n it, as represented by the staff. \\n \\n The reader must not conclude that the melody of \\n speech is confined to four degrees of pitch, whose inter- \\n vals are as determinate as those of the diatonic scale. \\n The intervals between the several notes of an empha- \\n sis melody vary according to circumstances. In ener- \\n getic declamation, and in interrogative and exclamatory \\n sentences, they may be said to be at their maximum ; \\n in solemn, and in plaintive discourse, at their minimum. \\n Neither must the reader conclude that the melody of \\n speech consists solely of emphasis melodies. These form, \\n as it were, the grand outlines of the picture, and the \\n notes of the syllables not included in the emphasis \\n melodies, constitute the filling up and the shading of it. \\n \\n The graphic notes of song represent absolute, as well \\n as relative pitch. But as the graphic notes of an em- \\n phasis melody of speech denote relative pitch only, two \\n emphasis melodies similarly constructed, though differ- \\n ent in their relative intervals, may be represented by \\n the same series of graphic notes. \\n \\n In reading emphasis melodies, beginners are apt to \\n make the intervals too great. Care should be taken \\n to avoid this fault, or the melody will be caricatured. \\n A little practice, under a good teacher, will enable \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 56 (#66) ##############################################\\n\\n66 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n almost any one, who is not insensible to the changes \\n of pitch, to observe the proper intervals with tolerable \\n accuracy. And as these melodies are founded in the \\n nature of the subject, those who have a taste for elocu- \\n tion will scarcely require a teacher, for they will read \\n them, as it were, by intuition. \\n \\n CHAPTER III. \\n \\n MODULATION. \\n \\n MODULATION is a chang- \\n ing of the pitch-note to a \\n higher or lower degree of ele- \\n vation — in other words, it \\n is the process of changing the \\n key, or of passing from one \\n key to another. This change \\n is sometimes made to a proxi- \\n mate key ; at other times, a bold and abrupt transition \\n to a remote key is necessary to produce the desired \\n effect. Modulation is generally attended with a change \\n of force, or time; and, not unfrequently, with a change \\n of both. There is not a more important requisite in \\n Elocution — nothing which contributes more to the \\n pleasure of an audience — nothing which gives stronger \\n proof that an orator is master of his art, than a well- \\n regulated and expressive modulation. Modulation, \\n however, should never be resorted to for the sake of \\n mere variety — it should always be subservient to the \\n sense; for it is the province of modulation to mark \\n changes of sentiment, changes in the train of thought, \\n and parenthetical clauses. \\n \\n Under ordinary circumstances, the various modula- \\n tions of the voice, in reading and speaking, may be \\n represented by a staff of four lines.

The second line is \\n called the pitch-note line of the staff of modulation. \\n \\n A series of modulations, as represented by the fol- \\n lowing diagram, might, very appropriately, be termed \\n a melody of melodies. \\n \\n A SERIES OP MODULATIONS.

No. 2 is pre- \\n fixed to the first section, to show that this section is to \\n be read in the pitch-note of modulation ; No. 3 is pre- \\n fixed to the second, section, to show that this section \\n should be read in the third degree of the staff of modu- \\n lation : No. 4 is prefixed to the third section, to show \\n that this section should be read in the fourth degree \\n of the staff of modulation ; No. 1 is prefixed to the \\n fourth section, to show that this section should be \\n read in the first degree of the staff of modulation ; and \\n so on. (See the Extract, and Diag. 13.) \\n \\n Some public speakers, who are ignorant of the principles of Elo- \\n cution, but who, nevertheless, are considered by the vulgar as \\n great orators, modulate their voices in the most erratic and hyper- \\n bolical manner. I once heard a clergyman pronounce the follow- \\n ing sentence in the way which I shall describe : \\n \\n \" While God\\'s omniscient eye passes from seat to seat, | and \\n ranges throughout the house, j he beholds what is passing in every \\n heart.\" \\n \\n The first section, while God\\'s omniscient eye passes from seat \\n to seat, he pronounced in the first degree above the lowest note of \\n his voice ; the second section, and ranges throughout the house, he \\n uttered with great force, in the highest note of his natural voice; \\n the third section, he beholds what is passing in every heart, he \\n pronounced with a mixture of vocality and aspiration, in the lowest \\n note of his voice. Such wild and extravagant transitions, though \\n they may astonish the ignorant, \" cannot but make the judicious \\n grieve.\" The manner in which the speaker pronounced the first \\n and third section in the above sentence, is good ; and had he pro- \\n nounced the second section in the same pitch and force with the \\n first, his elocution would have been faultless. \\n \\n There are other public speakers who never modulate their voices, \\n however necessary it may be to give proper expression to their sen- \\n timents; and, what is worse, they generally pitch their voices a \\n third, a fifth, or an octave too high. I once listened to an excellent \\n discourse, from a very learned man, which, however, was nearly \\n lost upon the audience from the disgusting manner in which it was \\n delivered. The lecturer pitched his voice an octave too high, and \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################\\n\\nFORCE, \\n \\n 59 \\n \\n spoke an hour and a half, without any variation in pitch, force, or \\n time; and, what rendered his delivery still more offensive, every \\n syllable was marred with an intolerable drawling. Such elocution \\n is discreditable to any man who speaks in public, and ought not to \\n be tolerated by an educated community. \\n \\n SECTION III. \\n \\n FORCE. \\n \\n ORCE is the degree of the loud- \\n ness of sounds. It is also the \\n degree of exertion with which \\n sounds are made. \\n \\n A lax division of force is into \\n loud and soft : those sounds are \\n called loud, which are made \\n with greater effort than the or- \\n dinary tones of conversation ; and those are called soft, \\n which are made with less effort. \\n \\n Some use the terms high and low, as synonymous with loud and \\n soft. But this is an improper application of these words. High \\n and low regard the acuteness and gravity of sounds only, and not \\n their force : a sound may be high and soft, as well as high and loud — \\n a sound may also be low and loud, as well as low and soft. \\n \\n For convenience, force is divided into nine degrees. \\n These degrees are expressed by the following abbre« \\n via t ions : \\n \\n PPP (pianissimo), .. as soft as possible. \\n \\n pp (piu piano), more soft, very soft. \\n \\n p (piano), soft. \\n \\n mp (mezzo piano), . . middling soft, rather soft. \\n \\n m (mezzo), half, middle, mean. \\n \\n mf (mezzo forte), . . middling loud, rather loud. \\n \\n / (forte), loud. \\n \\n ff (piii forte), more loud, very loud. \\n \\n (ff (fortissimo), ... as loud as possible. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 60 (#70) ##############################################\\n\\n60 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n The nine degrees of force are represented by Diag. \\n 14.

A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual \\n diminution of force. \\n \\n 3. A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual \\n increase of force. \\n \\n 4.

On the contrary, \\n soft sounds are connected with ideas of gentleness and delicacy. \\n The contrasts produced by the different degrees of force with which \\n sounds are uttered, form the most prominent effects of musical ex- \\n pression. The rushing of the fortissimo brings with it dread and \\n alarm ; but in the pianissimo, the chiaroscuro* of the art, we feel \\n the opposite sensation. The indistinctness of sounds apparently \\n removes them to a distance — like the faint touches in painting, \\n they seem to retire from us. Upon this principle, the ventriloquist \\n deceives the ear, by directing the attention to a point from which \\n the voice may be supposed to proceed ; and effects the deception by \\n reducing it to the exact degree of softness that it would seem to \\n possess had it really proceeded from the spot.\" \\n \\n CRESCENDO AND DIMINUENDO. \\n \\n \" What is more alarming than the gradual increase of a mighty \\n sound, when it pours upon the ear from a distance; — whether it \\n proceeds from the roar of a multitude, or the raging of a storm, the \\n auditory sense is overwhelmed, and the mind is filled with imagi- \\n nary danger ! When the increasing force accumulates to excessive \\n loudness, the vibrations become too great for the soul to bear. \\n There is also a sublimity in the gradual decrease of sounds. \\n \\n \" It is equally sublime to listen to sounds when they retire from \\n us. Handel has aimed at this poetic effect in the \\' Messiah,\\'\\' when \\n he pictures the ascent of the heavenly host, giving an idea of theii \\n distance and flight. \\n \\n \"There is no accomplishment in the art of singing more fascinat- \\n ing than the swelling and dying rfway of the voice; — when used \\n with taste and judgment, it never fails to delight us. The perform- \\n ance of the \\'■Miserere,\\'\\' in the Sixtine Chapel, in Rome, so often \\n described by travellers, owes its shadowy effect to this approaching \\n and retiring of the sounds. Farinelli moved his audience to a state \\n of ecstasy by the manner in which he commenced his famous song \\n \\' Son qual nave,\\'\\' \\' the first note of which was taken with such deli- \\n cacy, swelled by minute degrees to such an amazing volume, and \\n afterwards diminished in the same manner to a mere point, that it \\n was applauded for five minutes.\\' Beethoven is the only composer \\n who has introduced this effect into choral music: we find it applied \\n at the termination of some of the choruses in his posthumous Mass; \\n — here the voices alone pour upon the ear with an effect like the \\n swelling and dying away of the storm. \\n \\n Chiaroscuro (Italian), the light of a shsde of a picture. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 63 (#73) ##############################################\\n\\nTIME. \\n \\n <33 \\n \\n FORZANDO. \\n \\n \" Explosive force forms a strong feature in the character of mo- \\n dern music ; we never find it expressed in any author before the \\n time of Haydn.

Solemn discourse requires a slow \\n movement ; simple narrative, a medium rate of utter- \\n ance ; animated description, as well as all language \\n expressive of any sudden passion, as joy, anger, &c, a \\n movement more or less rapid, according to the inten- \\n sity of emotion. In the science of music, various terms \\n have been employed to denote the rate of movement, \\n the principal of which are the following : \\n \\n Adagio, very slow ; the slowest time. \\n \\n Largo, slow time. \\n \\n Larghetto, . . . slow, but not so slow as largo. \\n Andante,. . . . medium time. \\n Andantino, . . a little quicker than andante. \\n Allegretto,. . . rather quick, but not so quick as allegro. \\n Allegro, .... quick time. \\n \\n Presto, very quick. \\n \\n Prestissimo . . as quick as possible. \\n \\n Adagio, andante and allegro, are the three chief di- \\n visions of time ; the other terms mark the intermediate \\n degrees. \\n \\n In addition to the foregoing terms, which mark the \\n movement, there are others, which indicate the style \\n of performance. Some of these are as follows : \\n \\n Affetuoso, . . affectionate — a soft and delicate style of performance. \\n Brilldnte,. . shining, sparkling — a gay, showy style. \\n Furioso,. . . fierce, mad — a vehement style. \\n Spiritoso,. . spirited — a spirited style. \\n \\n Sometimes these terms are used in connexion w 7 ith \\n those which express the rate of movement, thus : — \\n \\n Allegro con spirito, quick with spirit — in a quick and spirited \\n manner. \\n \\n The rate of movement is not definitely marked by \\n the terms Adagio, Largo, Larghetto, &c. ; it may, how- \\n ever, be designated with precision by means of the \\n \\n METROTOME OF MAELZEL. \\n \\n This instrument has a graduated pendulum, to which \\n is attached a sliding weight. The higher this w r eight \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 67 (#77) ##############################################\\n\\nTIME. \\n \\n 6? \\n \\n is moved upon the pendulum, the \\n slower are its vibrations ; and the \\n contrary. When the weight cor- \\n responds to the number 50, the vi- \\n brations of the pendulum are the \\n slowest; when it corresponds to \\n 160, they are the quickest. All \\n the numbers on the instrument \\n have reference to suninute of time. \\n Thus, when the weight is placed \\n at 50, fifty beats, or ticks, occur \\n in a minte ; when at 60, sixty beats \\n in a minute ; when at 100, one \\n hundred beats in a minute, &c. \\n The engraving in the margin represents the instrument \\n in action. \\n \\n In reading, as a general rule, the time should be \\n marked on the metronome by whole measures — in \\n other words, each measure should correspond to one \\n tick of the instrument. \\n \\n In music, it is most convenient to mark the time on \\n the metronome in adagios, by quavers ; in andantes, by \\n crotchets ; in allegros, by minims ; and in prestos, by \\n whole measures. \\n \\n EXAMPLES OP THE SEVERAL MOVEMENTS. \\n \\n In the following Examples, the words which indi- \\n cate the movement and the corresponding numbers on \\n the metronome, are both employed. \\n \\n J. !

Hence its cultivation is of primary importance \\n to those who are ambitious of accomplishment in Elo- \\n cution. \\n \\n CHAPTER I. \\n \\n POSTURES OF THE BODY. \\n \\n The postures of the body, with respect to vocal \\n delivery, may be divided into favourable and unfavour- \\n able ; and, the better to suit my purpose in giving their \\n illustration, I shall first treat of the unfavourable. \\n \\n The most unfavourable posture is the horizontal. If \\n a reader or a speaker should lie prone, or supine, he \\n would not be likely to deliver a discourse with energy \\n and effect. I have never known an orator to deliver \\n a discourse in the horizontal posture ; but I have known \\n individuals to speak in public in postures almost as in- \\n appropriate. \\n \\n As impressions communicated through the medium \\n of the eye, are the most lasting, two series of figures are \\n \\n (69) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################\\n\\n70 \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n here introduced, the former of which are unfavourable, \\n and the latter favourable, to vocal delivery. \\n \\n POSTURES UNFAVOURABLE TO VOCAL DELIVERY. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 71 (#81) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 71 \\n \\n POSTURES FAVOURABLE TO VOCAL DELIVERY. \\n \\n DEMONSTRATING ON THE BLACK-BOARD. \\n \\n ■Hi \\n \\n Absurd as are the unfavourable postures on page 70, \\n f have known readers to adopt not only all these, but \\n others equally inappropriate and ridiculous.

Hence, \\n any thing that interrupts methodical instruction, is a \\n serious obstacle to the growth of intellect. Nor is \\n order more necessary than perseverance ; consequently \\n all postures of the body which are calculated for re \\n pose, should be avoided by the student in elocution \\n And as grace and dignity are of primary importance \\n in vOcal delivery, all postures which are inconsistent \\n with these attributes should also be avoided. \\n \\n The erect posture of the body is the best for vocal \\n delivery ; the trunk and limbs should be braced in pro- \\n portion to the degree of energy required by the senti- \\n ments to be delivered. The right foot should be from \\n two to four inches in advance of the left, and the toes \\n turned a little outwards ; meanwhile the body should \\n be principally sustained by the left foot. \\n \\n The next best is the erect sitting posture, in which \\n the shoulders do not rest against the back of the seat, \\n and in which the body is retained in its proper posi- \\n tion by muscular action. (See Ornamental Letter, \\n page 11 and 16.) \\n \\n The next best is the erect sitting posture in which \\n the shoulders rest against the back of the seat. \\n \\n These are the only postures which are at all favour- \\n able to vocal delivery. \\n \\n MANNER OF HOLDING THE BOOK. \\n \\n The book should be held in the left hand, from six \\n to eight inches from the body, and as high as the centre \\n of the breast, so as to bring the face nearly perpendi- \\n cular. It should not, however, be held so high as to \\n prevent the audience from having a view of the reader\\'s \\n mouth, as his voice would thereby be more or less ob- \\n structed. The fingers of the right hand may take hold \\n of the margin of the book lightly (see Fig. 10, and Orna- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 73 (#83) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 73 \\n \\n mental Letter, page 16), so as to be ready to turn over the \\n leaves, as occasion may require ; or they may be placed \\n upon the page, just below the line the reader is pronounc- \\n ing, to aid him in keeping his place ; or, particularly \\n if the reader is pronouncing an original composition, \\n the right hand may be employed to illustrate and en- \\n force the sentiments by appropriate gesticulation. (See \\n Fig. 11.) If the reader be a lady, the right hand may \\n support the left arm. (See Fig. 12.) I do not, how- \\n ever, advise ladies to adopt this posture exclusively, \\n but deem it not ungraceful for them. \\n \\n The eyes should occasionally be directed from the \\n words of the discourse to the audience. (See Fig. 11.) \\n \\n In demonstrating on the black-board, the face, and \\n not the back, should be turned to the audience. (See \\n Fig. 13 and 14.) \\n \\n CHAPTER II. \\n \\n NOTATION OF GESTURE. \\n \\n The want of a language for expressing the different \\n modifications of gesture with brevity and perspicuity, \\n is the principal cause of the general neglect with which \\n the cultivation of this art has hitherto been treated. \\n For this desideratum the world is indebted to the Rev. \\n Gilbert Austin, of London. In 1806, this distinguished \\n elocutionist published a quarto volume of six hundred \\n pages ; and from that work I have taken the system \\n of notation of which the following is a specimen : \\n \\n When the right arm is elevated backwards, and the \\n left extended forwards, in a horizontal direction, he \\n calls the posture of the former elevated backwards, and \\n notes it eb ; and the posture of the latter, horizontal \\n forwards, and notes it hf Now the abbreviations eb \\n and hf are placed over any word which requires these \\n postures of the arms, thus : — \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 74 (#84) ##############################################\\n\\nT4 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n eb — hf \\n \\n Jehovah\\'s arm \\n \\n Snatch\\'d from the waves, and brings to me my son !* \\n \\n Douglas, Act 111 \\n \\n For an illustration of these gestures, the reader is \\n referred to the ornamental letter on page 69. \\n \\n The original idea of this system of notation, says Mr. \\n Austin, was suggested by the labour of teaching decla- \\n mation in the usual manner. During this labour, which \\n for many years constituted a part of his duty in his \\n grammar-school, the author having often found that he \\n forgot, on a following day, his own mode of instructing \\n on a former, wished to be able to invent some perma- \\n nent marks, in order to establish more uniformity in \\n his instructions, for the ease both of himself and of his \\n pupils. The mode of instruction is not so liable to \\n change, with respect to the expression of the voice, and \\n countenance, for this is always pointed out by the sen- \\n timent. But the great difficulty lies in ascertaining \\n and marking the suitable gesture ; and for these ob- \\n vious reasons ; because a language of gesture was want- \\n ing, and because gesture may be infinitely varied, and \\n yet, perhaps, be equally just. To leave the pupil to \\n choose for himself would but distract him, and, instead \\n of giving him freedom and grace, would deprive him \\n of both. On his commencement as a public speaker \\n (which cannot be too early), it is necessary to teach \\n him every thing, and to regulate, by rules, every pos- \\n sible circumstance in his delivery ; his articulation, \\n accent, emphasis, pauses, &c, and along with all, his \\n gesture. After sufficient instruction and practice, he \\n will regulate his own manner, according to the sugges- \\n tions of his judgment and taste. \\n \\n Among the higher objects of this system of notation, \\n may be reckoned its uses as a record, whence the his- \\n \\n * Although an explanation of the gestures on Jehovah\\'s arm, in \\n the above sentence, is sufficient to answer my present purpose, it \\n may not be improper to inform the reader that another gesture is \\n required on the word son. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 75 \\n \\n torical painter may derive the materials of truth, and \\n whence the orator and the elocutionist may not only \\n obtain the instructions of the great men who have pre- \\n ceded them in the same career, but by which also they \\n may secure, unalterably, their own improvements for \\n the advancement of their art, and for the benefit of \\n posterity. A scene of Shakspeare, or a passage of Mil- \\n ton, so noted, after the manner of a great master of \\n recitation, or an oration so noted as delivered by an \\n admired speaker, would prove an enduring study of \\n truth and nature combined with imagination. And the \\n aspiring orator would not be obliged, as at present, to \\n invent for himself an entire system of action. He might \\n derive light from the burning lamps of the dead, and \\n proceed at once, by their guidance, towards the highest \\n honours of his profession. \\n \\n Had the ancients possessed the art of notating their \\n delivery, such was the unwearied diligence of their \\n great orators, Demosthenes and Cicero, that we should, \\n most probably, at this day, be in possession of their \\n manner of delivery, as well as the matter of their ora- \\n tions ; and not be limited to conjecture relative to a \\n single sentence of these eminent speakers, on the great \\n occasions which called forth their powers. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 76 (#86) ##############################################\\n\\n76 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n CHAPTER III. \\n \\n POSITION OF THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS. \\n \\n The parts of the human figure which are brought \\n into action, in gesture, cannot, in truth, be considered \\n separate ; for every muscle, over which men can exer- \\n cise voluntary action, contributes, in some measure, to \\n the perfection of gesture. For, convenience, how T ever, \\n we may enumerate and class the most distinguished \\n parts of the body, which effect the principal gestures. \\n These are : \\n \\n 1. The Head. 5. The Hands and Fingers. \\n \\n 2. The Shoulders. 6. The Low r ER Limbs and \\n \\n 3. The Trunk. Knees. \\n \\n 4. The Arms. 7. The Feet. \\n \\n I shall begin, as it were, with the foundation of the \\n building, and shall first consider the positions and \\n motions of the feet and lower limbs ; since without the \\n stability and ease of these, neither grace nor dignity \\n can consist in the standing figure. \\n \\n As the object of the orator is to persuade, and as \\n prejudice against his person or manners may greatly \\n impede him, he must recommend himself by every at- \\n tention to his external deportment which may be \\n deemed correct and proper ; and guard against every \\n species of inelegance that may prove disadvantageous. \\n He must, therefore, even in his posture as he stands, \\n prefer manly dignity and grace to awkward rusticity \\n and rude strength. Rude strength may suit him who \\n wishes to terrify, or to insult ; but this is rarely the \\n purpose of a public speaker. Grace and decorum win \\n favour; and this is the general object. Rude strength \\n stands indeed with stability, but. without grace. \\n \\n The gracefulness of motion in the human form, or \\n perhaps in any other, consists in the facility and secu- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 77 (#87) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 77 \\n \\n nty with which it is executed. And the grace of any \\n postures (except such as are manifestly designed for \\n repose), consists in the apparent facility with which \\n they can be varied. Hence, in the standing figure, the \\n posture is graceful when the weight of the body is \\n principally supported by one limb, whilst the other is \\n so placed as to be ready to relieve it promptly, and \\n without effort. And as the limbs are formed for a \\n mutual share of labour and of honour, so their alterna- \\n tion in posture, and in motion, is agreeable and grace- \\n ful. \\n \\n The body must then be supported, if grace be con- \\n sulted, on either limb, like Apollo, Antinous, and other \\n beautiful and well-executed statues. \\n \\n The positions of the feet are expressed by the nota- \\n tion annexed, which is to be written under the word \\n where the speaker is to assume such position. They \\n are the follow in 2 : \\n \\n First Position of the Right Foot, noted R. 1. (See Fig. 15) \\n \\n The upper part of the figure represents the eleva- \\n tion of the position ; the lower, the plan. \\n \\n In this position the right foot (advanced before the \\n eft about the breadth of the foot), \\n orms, with the left, an an^le of \\n about seventy-five degrees, as may \\n be seen in the plan. The lines \\n which form this angle, passing \\n through the length of each foot, \\n meet its vertex under the heel of \\n the left. The principal weight of \\n the body is sustained by the left \\n foot ; the right rests lightly, but in \\n its whole length, upon the floor. \\n This fact is shown in the plan by deeply shading the \\n left foot, and lightly shading the right. \\n 6 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 78 (#88) ##############################################\\n\\n78 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n Second Position of the Right Foot >notedR. 2. \\n \\n In this position, the right foot sliding forward about \\n half its length, receives the principal \\n weight of the body, the left being \\n raised, and turning as far inwards \\n towards the right ; the ball of the \\n left great toe only lightly touching \\n the floor, to keep the body from tot- \\n tering. In the plan, the right foot, \\n by which the weight of the body is \\n principally sustained, is all shaded, \\n while that part only of the left is \\n shaded which rests upon the floor. \\n \\n The angle formed by lines drawn through the length \\n \\n of the feet, in this position, is about ninety degrees. \\n In this position, when the feet are near together, the \\n \\n entire sole of the left foot may lightly touch the floor ; \\n \\n but when the feet are separated about their own length, \\n \\n or more, the left should touch only near the great toe ; \\n \\n the knee should be bent, and the heel turned inward, \\n \\n as in Fig. 24 and 26. \\n \\n First Position of th* Left Foot, noted L. 1. (See Fig. 17). \\n \\n This position of the left foot is, in \\n all respects, analogous to the first \\n position of the right. The left foot \\n is advanced, and the body is princi- \\n pally supported by the right. The \\n shading of the plan is similar to that \\n in the first position of the right, and \\n for the same purposes. \\n \\n The first position of the right foot \\n is the proper reading position, when \\n no gesture is employed ; but it should be occasionally \\n alternated with the first position of the left, for the \\n relief of the supporting muscles. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 79 (#89) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE \\n \\n 79 \\n \\n Second Position of the Left Foot, noted L. 2.

In both positions the right \\n foot advances about half its own \\n length, as may be seen by comparing \\n it with the equidistant parallel lines. In the first posi- \\n tion of the right foot, the lines ff, ff passing through \\n the centre of the feet, s \\n \\n make an angle of F- \\n \\n about seventy-five de- \\n grees ; and in the se \\n \\n cond position, the \\n \\n lines SS make an an- - \\n \\n gle of about ninety \\n degrees.

It is also the proper rising position \\n of the orator. But should he stretch forth his arms \\n towards the audience, when he begins to speak, he \\n should take the second position. \\n \\n Besides the four positions above mentioned, there are \\n two others, w T hich may be called positions in front. \\n The heels are placed nearly together, and the body is \\n supported, alternately, on the right and left foot, whilst \\n the toes of the other lightly touch the floor. The angle \\n formed by the feet, in these positions, is somewhat \\n greater than a right angle. In other respects they \\n are similar to the ordinary positions. The right po- \\n sition in front, noted R. F., is when the body is sup- \\n ported on the left foot. The left position in front, \\n noted L. F., is when the body is supported on the right \\n foot. The position in front is used when persons are \\n addressed alternately, on either side, whilst the audi- \\n tors are in front, as on the stage. It is not graceful, \\n and should not often be used ; it is too stiff and formal, \\n like the military figure, and presents the body with too \\n much uniformity and flatness.* \\n \\n * This appears to be the position condemned by Qumtilian : \\n \" The swing of those who balance their body to the right side and \\n left, upon the alternate feet, is very ungraceful.\" \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 81 (#91) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 81 \\n \\n Connected with these positions which express the \\n moderate state of the feet, are marked the same posi- \\n tions in the extended state. (Fig. 20.) These differ \\n from the moderate, principally, in the greater separa- \\n tion of the feet. The second position extended, en- \\n larges the angle a few degrees by drawing up the heel \\n of the retired foot. (See Fig. 46 and 89.) The first \\n extended position is made when a person retires in any \\n degree of alarm; and the second, when he advances \\n with boldness. (See Fig. 106 and 108.) An x is added \\n to the notation to express the extended position, thus ; \\n R. 1. x; R. 2. x; &c. \\n \\n The contracted position may be easily understood by \\n supposing the heels to be brought close together. A c \\n is added to the notation, to express the contracted \\n position, thus: R. 1. c. \\n \\n The attitude of the orator should not be like that of \\n the affected dancing-master, which is adapted to spring- \\n ing agility and conceited display. The orator should \\n adopt such attitudes and positions only as consist with \\n manly simplicity and grace. The toes should be turned, \\n not inwards, like those of the awkward rustic, but \\n moderately outwards ; and the limbs should be so dis- \\n posed as to support the body with ease, and to change \\n with facility. The sustaining foot should be planted \\n firmly; the leg braced, but not contracted; and the \\n knee straightened (contraction suits the spring neces- \\n sary for the dancer, and bent knees belong to feeble- \\n ness, or timidity) ; the other foot and limb should press \\n lightly, and be held relaxed, so as to be ready for im- \\n mediate change and action, except in very energetic \\n delivery, where both limbs should be braced. The \\n trunk of the body should be well balanced, and sus- \\n tained erect upon the supporting limb, except in such \\n instances as particularly require its inclination, as \\n veneration, supplication, &c. The orator should face \\n his audience.

The changes \\n should not be too frequent : frequent change gives the \\n idea of anxiety and instability, which are unfavourable \\n to an orator. \\n \\n The several acts resulting from the changes in the \\n positions of the feet, are, advancing (noted a) ; re- \\n tiring (r) ; traversing (tr.) ; starting (s. or st.) ; stamp- \\n ing {sp.),&LC. \\n \\n If more steps than one are to be expressed (as in the \\n business of the theatre) the number may be introduced \\n in a parenthesis, after the letter marking the step, and \\n then the position follows which finishes the movement ; \\n thus, a (2) R. 2, means, advance two steps to the se- \\n cond position of the right foot. In private declama- \\n tions, or recitations on a platform, or rostrum, these \\n figures are not necessary, as a single step, in advancing \\n or retiring, is sufficient.* \\n \\n Changes of position, or steps, are considered to be \\n made only by the foot on which the body is not sup- \\n ported, for that alone is free. Should it be required to \\n move the foot which supports the body (suppose the \\n left, in the first position of the right, Fig. 15), two mo- \\n \\n * I have frequently seen college students take three steps to the \\n right, then three to the left, then three again to the right, and so \\n on, till they had changed their position fifteen times during the de- \\n livery of a discourse which did not occupy them more than ten \\n minutes. And I have known a clergyman to traverse the whole \\n length of his pulpit twenty-three times during the delivery of a ser- \\n mon. Such erratic movements in a public speaker are undigni- \\n fied : they betray a want of judgment, and are exceedingly annoy- \\n ing to an audience. An orator should \"keep in his place:\" he \\n should perform all the movements of his feet within the limits of \\n thirty-six inches square, and not be continually running about the \\n room ad if labouring under the effects of nitrous oxide. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 83 (#93) ##############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. \\n \\n 83 \\n \\n ^ \\n \\n xX.i \\n \\n tions are necessary ; in the first the position must be \\n changed to R. 2.

(See \\n Fig. 21 and 22.) \\n The plan of the \\n steps, in the origi- \\n nal position, is in \\n the centre, and \\n drawn larger ; the \\n plan of the steps, \\n made from that ori- \\n ginal position, is re- \\n presented smaller. \\n The line of motions \\n of the feet, is repre- 21 \\n \\n sented by a line of dots, nearly of the same form which \\n each foot should trace ; the line of the free, or first- \\n moving foot, is marked with a star.

Seve- \\n ral of these dispositions of the fingers are employed by \\n our speakers, but without attaching to them any par- \\n ticular significancy. Either they are natural gestures, \\n or they are imitations, of which the origin is not re- \\n membered, or regarded, as many of our apparently \\n original actions are. \\n \\n The postures of the hand are determined by four \\n different circumstances : \\n \\n 1. By the disposition of the fingers. \\n \\n 2. By the manner of presenting the palm. \\n \\n 3. By the combined disposition of both hands. \\n \\n 4. By the part of the body on which they are occa- \\n sionally placed. \\n \\n First Class of the Postures of the Hands, depending on \\n the Disposition of the Fingers. \\n \\n The natural state, noted n., Fig. 51. The hand, \\n when unconstrained, in its natural, and relaxed state, \\n either hanging down at rest, or raised moderately up \\n has all the fingers a little bent inwards towards the \\n \\n 7 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 94 (#104) #############################################\\n\\n94 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n palm ; the middle and third finger lightly touch ; the \\n fore-finger is separated from the middle finger, and less \\n bent, and the little finger separated from the third, and \\n more bent. The extremity of the thumb bends a little \\n outwards; and, in its general length and disposition, is \\n nearly parallel with the fore-finger. When the arm is \\n raised horizontal, the hand is held obliquely between \\n the postures inward and supine. Cresoilius recom- \\n mends the public speaker to adopt this posture of the \\n hand, and for this preference he adduces the authority \\n of Hippocrates and Galen. But it is not necessary that \\n a speaker should confine himself to any one posture of \\n the hand ; variety may often demand the contrary : if \\n however, he should prefer using only \\n one, this posture merits the preference. \\n \\n Clinched, c, Fig. 52. The fingers, in this disposition, \\n are firmly closed, and press their extremities upon the \\n palm ; the thumb aids the pressure, and is lapped, par- \\n ticularly, over the middle finger. \\n \\n Extended, xf* Fig. 53. The fingers, in this state, \\n whatever may be the general position of the hand, are \\n separated from each other with energy in proportion to \\n the excitation of the speaker. \\n \\n Index, i, Fig. 54, 55, 56.

The \\n movements of the head should be suited to the charac- \\n ter of the delivery ; they should accord with the ges- \\n ture, and fall in with the action of the hands, and the \\n motions of the body. \\n \\n The head is capable of many appropriate expres- \\n sions. Besides those nods which signify assent, or ap- \\n probation and rejection, there are motions of the head, \\n known, and common to all, which express modesty, \\n doubt, admiration and indignation. But to use the \\n gesture of the head alone, unaccompanied by any other \\n gesture, is considered faulty. It is also a fault to shake \\n or nod the head frequently, to toss it violently, or to \\n agitate the hair, by rolling it about. \\n \\n The most usual motions and postures of the head, \\n are as follows. In the notation, the head and eyes \\n may, without confusion, be considered together. \\n \\n Postures and Motions of \\n the Head. \\n \\n Inclined, noted - - I \\n \\n Erect, \" - - E \\n \\n Assenting, \" - - As \\n \\n Direction of the Eyes. \\n \\n Forwards, noted - • F \\n Averted, \" - - A \\n \\n Downwards, \" - - D \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 105 (#115) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 105 \\n \\n Denying, \" - - Dn Upward, \" - - U \\n \\n Shaking, \" - - Sh Around, \" - - R \\n \\n Tossing, \" - - Ts Vacuity, or \" \\n \\n Aside, \" - - S Vacancy,* \" - - V \\n \\n The motions of the trunk contribute much to the \\n effect in delivery. The gestures of the arms and hands, \\n therefore, should always be supported by the accom- \\n paniment of the body. Not by affected and ridiculous \\n contortions, but by the manly and free exertions of the \\n muscles of the body, the general consent of which is \\n indispensable to the production of graceful motion. \\n The raising up, or shrugging of the shoulders, in ordei \\n to express indifference, or contempt, is merely theatri- \\n cal, and should be sparingly used, even on the stage. \\n \\n The postures of the trunk might also be enumerated, \\n and be subjected to the rules of notation ; but this would \\n be unnecessary, as they are in general sufficiently un- \\n derstood, being the accompaniment of the motions of \\n the head, the arms and the hands. \\n \\n CHAPTER VII. \\n \\n THE STROKE AND TIME OF GESTURE. \\n \\n The arm, the fore-arm, the hand, and the fingers, \\n form the grand instrument of gesture, or, as Cicero \\n calls it, \" the weapon of the orator.\" The centre of \\n motion of this compound instrument, is the shoulder. \\n These parts do not move together in the manner of an \\n inflexible line ; but each separate joint often becomes \\n a new centre of motion for the portion between it and \\n the extremity. \\n \\n In gesticulating, this complex instrument does not \\n continue long in one direct line, nor in any particulai \\n \\n * Queen, Alas ! how is \\'t with you, \\n \\n That you do bend 3 r our eye on vacancy, \\n \\n And with the incorporeal air do hold discourse 1— Hamlet. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 106 (#116) ############################################\\n\\n106 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n flexure, but changes every moment the angles formed \\n at the different joints, which adds grace and variety to \\n the motions. The farther any portion of this complex \\n line is from the centre of motion, the greater space does \\n it pass through. The least motion, therefore, is that \\n made by the upper arm, and the greatest, that made \\n by the hand : from this circumstance alone, the ges- \\n tures of the latter are conspicuous. In gesticulating, \\n the hand has not only the advantage of being placed at \\n the extremity of the line farthest from the centre of \\n motion ; but, by means of the joint at the wrist, it can \\n spring with increased velocity on approaching the point \\n to which its gesture is directed. This action of the \\n hand is termed the stroke of the gesture ; and it should \\n be marked by different degrees of force, according to \\n the energy of the sentiment. In high passion, it should \\n be distinguished by a strong percussion; and in the \\n more moderate state of the speaker\\'s feelings, merely \\n by a turn of the hand, by a change of posture, or ele- \\n vation of the arm, or by a momentary arrest of the \\n motion of the gesture in its transitions. \\n \\n The stroke of the gesture is analogous to the empha- \\n sis of the voice ; and they should both fall exactly on \\n the accented syllable of the emphatic word. In this \\n way the emphatic force of the voice, and the stroke of \\n the gesture, co-operate in presenting the idea in the \\n most lively manner, to the eye as well as to the ear. \\n \\n There are other points of analogy between the voice \\n and gesture, which deserve consideration. In the sim- \\n ple and narrative parts of a discourse, there is little \\n effort or variety of expression, in the voice. Under \\n the same circumstances, the gesture, if any is used, \\n should be tame and simple ; but, in the more impas- \\n sioned parts, both should be equally exerted. The \\n gesture, also, in many instances, nearly imitates the \\n manner of the inflections of the voice. When the voice \\n rises, the gesture naturally ascends; and .when the \\n voice makes the falling inflection, or lowers its pitch, \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 107 (#117) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE 107 \\n \\n the gesture follows it by a corresponding descent ; and, \\n in the level and monotonous pronunciation of the voice, \\n the gesture seems to observe a similar limitation, by \\n moving rather in the horizontal direction, without much \\n varying its elevation. \\n \\n Some writers say, that, \" in calm discourse, the \\n words and the gestures should generally accompany \\n each other; but, in impassioned discourse, the feelings \\n of the speaker should first be manifested in the eyes ; \\n then, by the countenance ; next, by the gesture ; and, \\n lastly, by the words.\" This is not just. In all dis- \\n course, whether calm or impassioned, the words and \\n the gestures should accompany each other. As, in \\n beating time in music, the beat is made on the accented \\n part of the measure, so in speaking, the stroke of the \\n gesture should fall on the accented syllable of the em- \\n phatic word. The emotion which calls forth the word, \\n at the same moment, prompts the gesture. Hence, the \\n muscles of gesticulation should move synchronously \\n and harmoniously with those of the voice. When ges- \\n ture is not marked by the precision of the stroke, in \\n the proper places, it is very offensive. The arms, like \\n those of a person groping in the dark, seem to wander \\n about in quest of some uncertain object ; and the ac- \\n tion is of that faulty kind which is called sawing the \\n air. Even graceful motions, unmarked by the pre- \\n cision of the stroke of the gesture, as sometimes seen, \\n particularly among singers on the stage, lose much of \\n their force, and very soon cease to afford pleasure. \\n All the unmeaning motions of public speakers are at- \\n tended with the same ill effect as a mouthing and cant- \\n ting tone of declamation, which lays no emphasis with \\n just discrimination, but swells and falls with a vain \\n affectation of feeling, and with absolute deficiency both \\n m taste and judgment. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 108 (#118) ############################################\\n\\n.08 \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n CHAPTER VIII. \\n \\n THE CLASSIFICATION OF GESTURE. \\n \\n The arms, as well as the hands, may be employed, \\n in gesticulation, separately, or together, each using \\n similar, or dissimilar actions. Each arm may perforin \\n \\n stg* similar gestures when \\n Mar the body of the speaker \\n is presented towards \\n the person addressed \\n precisely in front (Fig. \\n 92); but when the \\n body is not so pre- \\n sented, the gestures \\n will not be similar \\n (Fig. 93) ; and, as such \\n posture and gestures \\n are not graceful, they \\n are not frequently \\n used. \\n \\n The advancement of one hand before the other is \\n an indication of precedence, as is, also, in general, its \\n higher elevation. The advanced hand, therefore, is \\n said to perform the principal gesture. In general, trgj \\n elevation of the retired arm is a whole position lower \\n than that of the advanced arm ; and, though the ges- \\n ture of the retired hand occasionally resembles that of \\n the advanced hand, yet its action is performed with \\n less energy and authority. For these reasons, the ac- \\n tion of the retired hand is called the subordinate ges- \\n ture. \\n \\n There is aclass of gestures called significant gestures :* \\n \\n * As this word has long been applied to a certain class of ges- \\n tures, and as there is some difficulty in procuring a better, I have \\n followed my predecessors in its use. The objection to the word is \\n obvious — it conveys the idea that all the gestures which do not \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 109 (#119) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 109 \\n \\n the extending of the index-finger towards persons, or \\n things, points them out ; the laying of the hand on the \\n breast refers to the feelings of the speaker; the placing \\n of the finger on the lips signifies an injunction of si- \\n lence. &c. \\n \\n But gestures, in general, are too vague to be com- \\n prehended under this description : they denote a sort \\n of general relation in the expressions — their power to \\n do this is derived from the time and manner of their \\n application, from the place in which they are used, and \\n from their various combinations. Some are used at \\n the beginning of a sentence, merely to indicate a com- \\n mencement in action, as well as speech; some are used \\n for description ; some, for explaining, extending, or \\n limiting; and some, for enforcing the predominant idea; \\n some, for keeping the audience in suspense, till the \\n more decisive gestures ; and some, for marking the ter- \\n mination of the sense, and the final result of the reason- \\n ing. These various gestures may be divided into five \\n classes : \\n \\n 1. Commencing gestures. 4. Suspending gestures. \\n \\n 2. Discriminating gestures. 5. Emphatic gestures. \\n .3. x\\\\uxiliary gestures. \\n \\n 1. Commencing gestures are made simply by raising \\n the hand from rest; and that, in general, not higher \\n than the horizontal position. They are used at the \\n beginning, and at the divisions of a discourse. \\n \\n 2. Discriminating gestures comprehend all those ges- \\n tures which serve to indicate persons and objects, as \\n well as those which are used for explaining, extending, \\n limiting, or modifying the predominant idea, and those \\n which are employed in question and answer, when \\n made without vehemence. They are performed in the \\n intermediate degrees of the range of the gesture, with \\n \\n fall into the class of which this is the distinctive name, are insigni* \\n Jicant, or unmeaning; a conclusion by no means correct. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 110 (#120) ############################################\\n\\n110 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n model ate force, and at small intervals. In colloquial \\n intercourse they are frequently confined to the motions \\n of the head. \\n \\n 3. Auxiliary, or alternate gestures, serve to aid, or \\n enforce the gesture of the advanced hand. They are \\n performed as follows : after the advanced hand has \\n made its gesture on the emphatic word, instead of pass- \\n ing to another gesture, on the next emphatic word, it \\n remains in the attitude of the last stroke till the retired \\n hand is brought up in aid of it, either by a similar ges- \\n ture, or by a more decisive one. In this way, variety \\n and extraordinary energy are given, at once, to pas- \\n sages which admit of such gestures. Of course, these \\n gestures are used with great advantage in high passion; \\n they are also frequently employed in description, where \\n they are executed more tamely. \\n \\n 4. Suspending, or preparatory gestures, are so called \\n because they hold the audience in suspense, by the \\n elevation or contraction of the arm, preparatory to the \\n stroke which is to fall on the emphatic word. \\n \\n 5. Emphatic gestures mark, with force, words op- \\n posed to, or compared with, each other; and, more par- \\n ticularly, the word which expresses the predominant \\n idea. Their stroke is generally arrested on the hori- \\n zontal elevation. Sometimes, however, emphatic ges- \\n tures are directed to the highest point in their range ; \\n at other times, to the lowest. When they are directed \\n to a high point, they often serve as suspending, or pre \\n paratory gestures, to the next emphatic gesture ; and, \\n when made at the close of a sentence, they serve a; \\n terminating gestures ; because, when the last important \\n idea is marked, no other gesture should be added, to \\n weaken its effect ; the arm should then fall to rest. \\n \\n As a sentence is an epitome of a complete composi- \\n tion, having a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion, \\n among single sentences illustrations of these different \\n gestures may be found. In the following sentence the \\n gestures for the righrhand, only? are noted. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 111 (#121) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE.

They are, as it were, \\n the elements of gesture, which, by their combinations, \\n produce its whole power of language and expression. \\n These elements are the component parts of every style \\n of delivery, whether tame or vehement, argumentative \\n or diffuse, ardent or indifferent, cold or pathetic. \\n \\n It has been observed that the principal gesture is performed by \\n the advanced hand, and the subordinate gesture by the retired hand. \\n The best modern speakers use either the right, or the left hand, in- \\n discriminately, for the principal gesture, as occasion may require. \\n As this practice is altogether at variance with the opinions and \\n rules of the ancient critics and rhetoricians, it may be proper to in- \\n quire how far we are justifiable in our departure from their great \\n authority. \\n \\n \"The left hand,\" says Quintilian, \"can never, with propriety, \\n perform gesture alone ; but it frequently acts in support of the right \\n hand.\" The consideration of the dress of the \\n ancients, which differed so essentially from that \\n of the moderns, may be sufficient to account for \\n the difference between their customs and ours. \\n The form of the ancient dress obliged the speaker, \\n if not totally to disuse his left hand, at least to \\n restrain its action very considerably. (See Fig. \\n 94.) The occasions on which the left hand may \\n perform the principal gesture, are the following : \\n 1. When the persons addressed are on the left \\n side, the left hand naturally performs the prin- \\n cipal gesture, in order to avoid the awkward- \\n ness of gesticulating across the body. 2. The \\n necessary discrimination of objects opposed to \\n erch other, requires the left hand alternately to \\n perform the principal gesture. 3. The advan- \\n tage of variety. 4. The power of giving, not \\n only. variety, but force, by occasionally elevating the retired hand, \\n and bestowing upon it all the spirit and authority of the gesture. \\n \\n But it is not only in the use of the left hand that modern speakers \\n differ from the ancients: they constantly violate another precept \\n enjoined by Quintilian and his followers, viz., that of speaking with \\n \\n .ique position ; x, extended position ; veq, hands vertical, arms \\n elevated oblique; a, ascending; br, breast — the right hand is laid \\n on the breast; Bnef, both hands natural, the arms elevated for \\n wards; Bshf sh, both hands supine, arms horizontal forwards shak- \\n ing; R, rest, the hands fall to rest. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 113 (#123) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 113 \\n \\n the corresponding- hand and foot advanced.* And yet, if the natural \\n emotions afford any just foundation for the manner of gesture, we \\n shall be inclined to give the preference to modern custom. Those \\n passions which incline us to advance towards their object, as love, \\n desire, anger, and revenge, naturally cause the corresponding hand \\n and foot to advance together with the head and body ; for, in this \\n way, the nearest approach is made to the object. And when pas- \\n sions of a contrary nature, as aversion and terror, affect us, still the \\n corresponding hand and foot are advanced; as if the better to guard \\n the body and head, which are thrown back. In such cases, it would \\n produce unnatural distortion to advance the contrary hand and foot. \\n Under tranquil circumstances, as when the speaker delivers narra- \\n tive, or reasons calmly, the contrary hand and footf may advance \\n together with grace and propriety. Indeed, perhaps such posture \\n is preferable, as it p^sents the body more exactly in front towards \\n the persons addressed. It was, probably, such circumstances alone, \\n which Quintilian had in view when he pronounced his opinion, that \\n it is unbecoming to stand with the corresponding hand and foot ad- \\n vanced. This explanation will serve to reconcile the apparent \\n deviation of the moderns from the ancient practice. \\n \\n CHAPTER IX. \\n \\n THE PREPARATION, TRANSITION, AND ACCOMPANIMENT OP \\n GESTURE. \\n \\n In the transitions of gesture, the hand and arm should \\n not, in general, be precipitated to the intended position \\n by the shortest course ; but, in the calmer parts of the \\n oration, they should move in a sort of waving line, or \\n in one returning upon itself, somewhat in the manner \\n represented by the following diagram : \\n \\n Diag. 18. \\n \\n Let f represent tho position of the arm and hand for \\n wards, and let the place of the next gesture be q (ob* \\n \\n * Right hand and right foot ; or left hand and left foot. \\n \\n i The right hand and left foot ; or the left hand and right foot. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 114 (#124) ############################################\\n\\n114 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n Jique), and of a third be x (extended). The hand should \\n not move in the line of dots directly from/ to q, and \\n from q to x ; bat from / go back almost to c (across), \\n in order that it may traverse the greater space; and \\n then proceed to q with an accelerated motion for the \\n stroke of the gesture. In the same manner, and for the \\n same purpose, it should return back almost tof, before \\n t proceeds to x. \\n The ascending and descending gestures are performed \\n \\n Diag. 19. \\n \\n in the same manner, under simi \\n lar circumstances, as may be \\n seen in diagram 19, in which Z \\n is the zenith, and R the point of \\n rest, and where the hand, in \\n ascending and descending, is re- \\n presented as making returning \\n inflections at the principal points, \\n d, h, and e. \\n \\n The line of preparation as- \\n sumes a variety of other curves, \\n fourteen of which are repre- \\n sented by Diagram 20. \\n \\n Whatever form this indirect \\n line may be, it is used as a pre- \\n paration for the gesture to which \\n it leads; and the extent of the \\n return, or depth of the sweep or \\n -^Z^^ indentation, is determined by \\n \\n the character of the sentiments to be delivered. The \\n more magnificent they are, the greater is this parade ; \\n and the nearer to ordinary discourse, the less it is. \\n The preparation made by these different curves does \\n not suit every species of gesture ; it is adapted almost \\n solely to that kind which is termed discriminating \\n Another kind of preparation is made for emphatic ges- \\n tures. They are generally preceded by a suspending \\n gesture, which serves the double purpose of marking \\n some less important word, and of preparing for the \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 115 (#125) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE \\n \\n 115 \\n \\n stroke of the emphatic gesture.

This new letter, only, is ex- \\n pressed, and is joined by a long dash, or mark of connexion, with \\n the notation letters of the preceding gesture : another line of con- \\n nexion, joining this letter to x, signifies that both hands continuing \\n in the same position, viz. vertical, the arms are to be extended. The \\n gestures, marked at large on this line, would be as follows: \\n \\n Bvlif rt Bvhff ■ Bvhx \\n \\n To hear the roar she sends through all her gates.j\" \\n \\n But the former method is preferable, as it abridges the trouble ol \\n notation, and is equally intelligible. \\n \\n The connexion of gesture is, therefore, the relation \\n which one gesture bears to another ; and it is shown \\n by the notation of the circumstances in which they \\n agree, and of those in which they differ. Thus, the \\n gestures noted in the foregoing line agree, first, in \\n being common to both hands (B), and then in the posi- \\n tion of each hand, v {vertical), and also in the elevation \\n of both arms, h (horizontal). So that it is unnecessary \\n to repeat those circumstances in which they agree, as \\n the connecting-dash expresses them with sufficient \\n clearness, and with greater brevity. \\n \\n The connexion of gesture in the vertical direction, \\n when the hand, without altering its posture, merely \\n ascends by short intervals, in order to mark a succes- \\n sion of discriminating gestures, is noted by the usual \\n connecting-dash, and an a over the word where the \\n hand ascends. \\n \\n * The letters, ohc, signify, the hand outwards, the arm hori \\n 2ontal across; x rj, extended rejecting. \\n \\n f Bvhfrt, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal forwards re- \\n tracting ; Bvhfp, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal forward* \\n pushing ; Bvhx, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal extended. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 117 (#127) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 117 \\n \\n phf- \\n \\n I mourn the pride \\n \\n •me/ — shfst — \\n \\n And avarice that make man a wolf to man. — Coivper. \\n \\n But this passage would perhaps answer better with \\n he auxiliary gesture, thus : \\n \\n Bphfa vef — \\n \\n I mourn the pride \\n \\n — vef Bnef bn — Bs/ifst R \\n \\n And avarice that make man a wolf to man.* \\n \\n The transition of gesture relates to the manner of \\n arriving at a gesture, and to the changes of gesture ; \\n and signifies either the particular changes of the posi- \\n tion of the hand and arm, or the general change of the \\n principal gesture from one hand to the other. \\n \\n A gesture may have a very different character and \\n effect, according to the manner in which the hand ar- \\n rives at its destined point. It may ascend, descend, \\n move towards the right, or towards the left, and may \\n also make the stroke with various degrees of energy, \\n and in various ways ; and these motions constitute, in \\n each, an absolutely different gesture, though, after the \\n moment of the stroke, which a painter might choose to \\n represent, the hand and arm of each should be in the \\n same precise position. (Fig. 85, p. 100.) As, however, \\n the emphatic gestures are liable to ambiguity, on ac- \\n count of the various transitions which might be sup- \\n posed to bring them to their stroke, painters more fre- \\n quently choose to represent the suspending gestures, \\n which give an idea of action, and greater interest to \\n their principal figures. \\n \\n But the transition of gesture particularly relates to \\n the change of the principal gesture from one hand to \\n \\n * Bphfa, both hands prone horizontal forwards ascending 1 , \\n vef (followed by a dash), right hand vertical elevated forwards ; \\n vef (preceded by a dash), left hand vertical elevated forwards; \\n Bnefbn, both hands natural elevated forwards bending; Bsltf st, \\n both hands supine horizontal forwards striking. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 118 (#128) ############################################\\n\\n118 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n the other , which may be regulated, in some measure, \\n according to the following principles. So long as there \\n subsists a strict connexion between the sentiments, un- \\n interrupted by any considerable pause, or change of \\n persons, no transition can take place in this last sense : \\n the same hand which began, continues to perform the \\n principal gesture. And the variety which it is always \\n desirable to produce, must not be attempted by the \\n change of the principal gesture : it must arise alone \\n from the graceful and well-regulated action of the ad- \\n vanced hand, supported by the combined assistance or \\n accompaniment of the other. If the passage to be pro- \\n nounced be of considerable length, the right hand should \\n perform the principal gesture throughout the whole of \\n it. For the left, though allowed to take its place oc- \\n casionally, according to certain rules, by no means \\n arrives at an equality of honour. The right hand \\n always continues the better hand, both from long pre- \\n scription, and the ability arising from use. \\n \\n In the narrative parts of an oration, where different \\n persons or things are to be described as variously dis- \\n posed, or in the recitation of descriptive poetry, when \\n a picture, as it were, is to be represented by the speaker, \\n consisting of many natural objects in different parts of \\n a landscape, of which Gray\\'s Elegy in a Country \\n Church-yard will afford many examples, the right hand \\n having first pointed out those persons or objects sup- \\n posed to lie adjacent to itself, may yield to the left the \\n arrangement and ordering of those other parts, which \\n may be imagined to be at its own side. This inter- \\n change, judiciously regulated, produces a pleasing va- \\n riety in the gesture ; and if the speaker possess the \\n imagination of a painter, his disposition and colouring \\n will produce the most distinct and vivid picture. \\n \\n Variety, which is a most important object to be kept \\n in view by a public speaker, allows, with advantage, \\n an interchange of the principal gesture, even when the \\n subject may be of a more abstruse and demonstrative \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 119 (#129) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 119 \\n \\n nature. When there is any opposition, or antithesis, \\n among the ideas, or even in the structure of sentences, \\n or where a new argument is introduced, after the dis- \\n cussion of a former is ended, as at. a new division, or a \\n new paragraph, there may be a change of the principal \\n gesture. But it will be a point of judgment and taste \\n in the speaker not to carry this balancing, or alterna- \\n tion of gesture, to an affected extreme, and not, even in \\n allowable cases, to indulge in it overmuch ; nor will he \\n prolong too far the principal action permitted to the \\n left hand, which he will always remember is the weaker, \\n and admitted into the foremost place rather by courtesy \\n than of right ; and which he will, therefore, restrict \\n with discretion in the exercise of this occasional dis- \\n tinction. \\n \\n In the changes made from one hand to the other, the \\n transition should be managed with ease and simplicity. \\n As soon as the advanced hand has made the stroke of \\n its last, emphatic gesture, it should fall quietly to rest, \\n whilst, at the same time, the hand w r hich is, in its turn, \\n to assume the principal action, commences its prepara- \\n tion for the ensuing gesture. It will be observed that \\n a commencing, or discriminating gesture, should be \\n gentle, as a modest beginning suits its first entrance \\n into authority. An emphatic gesture immediately after \\n one from the other hand, would be violent and out- \\n rageous ; something like the gesticulations of those \\n little wooden figures set up to frighten birds from corn, \\n or fruit, which have the arms fixed on an axis in such \\n a manner that they are alternately raised and depressed \\n with equal vehemence, according as they are blown \\n about by the wind. \\n \\n When the orator finds it necessary to change the \\n position of the feet, so as to advance that which was \\n before retired, the general rule is that he should effect \\n it imperceptibly, and not commence the change till \\n after the hand has begun its change of action. Some \\n times, however, in vehement passages, the oratoi is \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 120 (#130) ############################################\\n\\n1^0 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n allowed, by the highest authority, to advance suddenly \\n and even to stamp. \\n \\n The subordinate gesture, already mentioned, as performed by the \\n retired hand, will be found to bear a ciose analogy to accompani- \\n ment in music. A little observation will suffice for acquiring a \\n general knowledge of the accompaniment of gesture ; and after \\n attentively practising ibr some time, the inferior hand will as easily \\n fall into a suitable accompaniment of the principal gesture, as the \\n left hand of a performer on a keyed instrument, will strike correctly \\n the fundamental bass. \\n \\n The general rule for accompaniment of gesture, in \\n calm and moderate speaking, when both hands do not \\n perform the same gesture, is that the retired arm should \\n be about one interval less raised than the advanced \\n arm, and that in the transverse position it should be \\n distant from it about two intervals, or a right angle. \\n Hence, if the right hand should perform the principal \\n gesture, and this gesture should be supine elevated for- \\n wards, the accompaniment would be expressed in the \\n \\n second set of letters, for the left hand, thus : -J-. , \\n \\n prm. ac. \\n \\n (Fig. 38) ; and again, vh f~~~ P dx , (Fig. 33). When the \\n prin. ac. \\n \\n force of the expression is strong, the accompanying \\n hand is equally elevated with the principal. In this \\n degree of force, the gestures are thus : vhf — vhx. \\n These circumstances afford convenient opportunities \\n for abridging the notation. When both hands perform \\n the same, or nearly the same gesture, a capital B pre- \\n ceding one set of letters suffices for both hands, as Bvhf \\n And when the accompanying gesture follows the gene- \\n ral rule, and has nothing remarkable distinguishing it, \\n the gesture of the principal hand only need be noted ; \\n the accompaniment is easily understood, and will fol- \\n low of course to the well-practised speaker. \\n \\n But besides the motions of the subordinate gesture, \\n other very important accompaniments are to be at- \\n tended to; as those of the lower limbs, of the body, \\n und of the head : otherwise the performance will bo \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 121 (#131) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE \\n \\n 121 \\n \\n rigid and absurd, like that of a puppet. Indeed, not \\n only those more prominent and distinguished parts \\n must accompany the voice and principal action of the \\n speaker, but every muscle of the body, and every ex- \\n pression of the countenance, must, join in harmony with \\n those gestures, in order to impress upon them the cha- \\n racter of nature and truth. There is no gesture, or \\n change of gesture, which is not meant to enforce or to \\n illustrate some new circumstance, which either cails \\n into action muscles before at rest, or into a change of \\n action those already in exertion. And this impression \\n and influence extend not only to those muscles which \\n are most strong and distinguished, but even to the most \\n delicate fibres of the human frame, such as those which \\n adjust the expression of the mouth, of the nostrils, of \\n the brows, and of that wonderful organ the eye. \\n \\n An example may here be given of some of the stronger \\n changes of the head, body, and lower limbs, which ac- \\n company certain principal gestures. If the right hand \\n be forcibly withdrawn, and presented vhfc (vertical \\n horizontal forwards contracted), the left vdqc (vertical \\n dowmwards oblique contracted), the \\n feet will naturally retire, and be \\n rRlx (retire to the first position \\n extended of the right foot). The \\n body, at the same time, will be \\n thrown backwards, whilst the whole \\n countenance will express aversion, \\n or horror. (Fig. 95). \\n \\n The gesture of the right, phf ad, \\n will be accompanied and noted thus : \\n \\n p /LJ. — — L_L which signifies that \\n aR2 ° \\n \\n the head, and consequently the body, \\n \\n leans forwards, and that the eyes are turned earnestly \\n \\n in the same direction. This evident desire of inspect \\n \\n ing the object more nearly, is also accompanied by an \\n \\n advanced step of the right foot, the principal gesture \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 122 (#132) ############################################\\n\\n122 \\n \\n ELOCUTION \\n \\n bemg performed by the right hand. As the gesture \\n of the left hand could hardly be avoided, under the \\n circumstances mentioned, the notation of it might have \\n been omitted. \\n \\n It will be observed, that if the hand, in its gestures, \\n \\n at any time \\n approach \\n the head, \\n the head \\n bends to- \\n wards the \\n hand ; and \\n if the hand \\n presents its \\n palm, and \\n pushes, as it \\n were, an ob- \\n ject away \\n in disgust, \\n \\n the head accompanies the action, not only by retiring \\n back, but by averting the face. And the motions ex- \\n pressing this aversion are ; first, the eye, directed to- \\n wards the object ; the approaching of the back of the \\n hand towards the face, and the head bending towards \\n the hand, and then the pushing forwards of the palm \\n of the hand, and the throwing back of the head, and \\n averting the face at the same time. The notation will \\n \\n stand thus : F vh f c ~~, (Fig. 96), and then, A vk 9 P ~~ \\n aR2 rRlx \\n \\n (Fig. 07). \\n \\n After the stroke of the emphatic gesture, if the \\n speaker has completely closed his remarks on a par- \\n ticular part of his subject, or if he has finished his ora- \\n tion, both hands should fall to rest, in a manner suiting \\n the last expressions which he has delivered. This \\n falling of the hand to rest is named the close and ter- \\n mination of gesture. It is contrary to the correct sim- \\n plicity of gesture to mark a single word or idea with \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 123 (#133) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 123 \\n \\n more than one emphatic stroke ; any appendix of ges- \\n ture, after this, would only weaken its force, or render \\n it ridiculous. \\n \\n The termination of gesture, or rather, the emphatic \\n gesture which terminates, should not be made across. \\n It is generally made about the horizontal elevation, but \\n sometimes it is made downwards, or elevated, according \\n to the sentiment. The horizontal termination suits \\n decision and instruction ; the downward, disapproba- \\n tion and condemnation ; the elevated, pride, high pas- \\n sion and devotion. \\n \\n CHAPTER X. \\n \\n THE FREQUENCY, MODERATION, AND INTERMISSION OP \\n GESTURE. \\n \\n As gesture is used for the illustration or enforce- \\n ment of language, it should be limited, in its applica- \\n tion, to such words and passages only as admit, or \\n rather require, such illustration or enforcement. That \\n is, gesture should not be used by a public speaker on \\n every word where it is possible to apply it without \\n manifest impropriety ; but it should rather be reserved \\n for such passages as require to be rendered more pro- \\n minent than the others, and to be more highly coloured. \\n A judicious speaker will therefore reserve his gesture, \\n at least the force and ornament of it, for those parts of \\n his discourse for which he also reserves the brilliancy \\n of language and thought. Sometimes, the absolute \\n intermission of gesture is advantageous, as in the com- \\n mencement or opening of arguments. When an argu- \\n ment is nearly concluded, moderate gesture will give \\n it more force, and relieve the monotony of a mere dry \\n demonstration, should the spirit of the composition \\n admit such addition. \\n \\n In all discourses, the frequency of gesture will be \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 124 (#134) ############################################\\n\\n124 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n determined, in general, by the number, the novelty, and \\n the discrimination of ideas. In every well-constructed \\n sentence, some new idea is advanced, which may be \\n marked by a suitable gesture; and possibly the various \\n limitations and modifications of it will also admit of a \\n similar distinction. Thus each separate clause, or \\n member of a sentence, may admit a distinct gesture on \\n the principal word: and as each epithet is a distinct \\n quality, added to the principal name, and as each ad- \\n verb has the same effect on the principal action ex- \\n pressed by the verb, a new gesture may be made on \\n each. But for this purpose, unless the word is empha- \\n tic, a turn of the hand, a small motion in the trans- \\n verse or vertical direction, or a slight inclination of the \\n head, is sufficient. \\n \\n In a sentence where every word is emphatic, each \\n may be marked with a gesture. Sentences of this kind \\n generally condense, in a small compass, valuable infor- \\n mation, and should therefore be strongly enforced and \\n marked with precision. They should, however, be \\n delivered distinctly and deliberately, or the gestures \\n will confuse the sentiment, and even cast a degree of \\n ridicule upon it, as may be found by pronouncing the \\n following serious observation with different degrees of \\n rapidity. \\n \\n shf — nef — sfrfst — \\n \\n JNJan is born to trouble. \\n \\n com. susp. emph. $ t-er. \\n \\n Neither the emphatic gesture, nor the force of the \\n voice, always falls on those words which are the prin- \\n cipal, in a grammatical sense — the nouns and verbs. \\n The gesture sometimes falls on the word which modi- \\n fies each — on the adjective, which expresses the \\n quality of the noun, or on the adverb, which has a \\n similar effect upon the action or assertion of the verb. \\n \\n The same notation, applied to a vehement passage \\n requires the arm to be raised higher than when it is \\n apolied to one of the contrary character. A judicious \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 125 (#135) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 125 \\n \\n speaker will often omit his gesture altogether, and use \\n it only when absolutely necessary to illustrate, or to \\n enforce his sentiments. Gesture may be said to hold \\n the place of high seasoning; it must, therefore, be \\n managed with discretion, lest it should defeat its own \\n purposes, and create disgust. If a speaker proves \\n truly eloquent, he is sure of the most liberal and solid \\n approbation. But he should not hazard too much ; he \\n should be guarded in the commencement of his dis- \\n course, and should restrain his gesture in the calm and \\n reasoning passages, reserving its force and brilliancy \\n for the appropriate expression of his most earnest feel- \\n ings and boldest thoughts. His transitions from the \\n narrative parts to those which are most highly wrought, \\n and which require his utmost exertions, should be gra- \\n dual and just, and free from extravagance. \\n \\n CHAPTER XL \\n \\n THE QUALITIES OF GESTURE, AND THE GESTURE SUITED \\n TO DIFFERENT MODES OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. \\n \\n The different qualities which constitute the perfec- \\n tion of gesture, and their opposite imperfections, are as \\n follows : \\n \\n 1. Magnificence. 5. Simplicity. \\n \\n 2. Boldness. 6. Grace. \\n \\n 3. Energy. 7. Propriety. \\n \\n 4. Variety. 8. Precision. \\n \\n 1. Magnificence of gesture. This is effected by de- \\n taching the elbow completely from the body, and \\n unfolding the whole oratorical weapon. In magnifi- \\n cent gesture, the action is flowing and unconstrained ; \\n the preparations are made in graceful curves ; the \\n transitions are easy, and the accompaniments, in all \\n respects, illustrative of the principal action. The mo- \\n 9 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 126 (#136) ############################################\\n\\n126 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n tions of the head are free, and the inflections of the \\n body manly and dignified. The action of the lower \\n limbs is decisive, and a considerable space is traversed \\n with firmness and with force. \\n \\n The opposite imperfections are short and constrained \\n gestures, rigidity of the joints, and stiffness of the body, \\n with short steps, and doubtful or timid movements. \\n \\n 2. Boldness of gesture. This arises from that ele- \\n vated courage and self-confidence which ventures to \\n hazard any action, however unusual, which is produc- \\n tive of a grand or striking effect. In this sort of ges- \\n ture, unexpected positions, elevations and transitions, \\n surprise at once by their novelty and grace, and thus \\n illustrate or enforce the ideas of the speaker with irre- \\n sistible effect. \\n \\n The opposite imperfection is tameness. \\n \\n 3. Energy of gesture. This consists in the firmness \\n and decision of the whole action ; and in the precision \\n of the stroke of the gesture, which aids the emphasis \\n of the voice. \\n \\n The opposite imperfections are feebleness and inde- \\n cision. \\n \\n 4. Variety of gesture. This consists in the applica- \\n tion of different, but appropriate gestures, to the same, \\n or analogous sentiments, so as to avoid recurring too \\n frequently to one favourite gesture, or set of gestures. \\n \\n The opposite imperfection is monotony of gesture, \\n analogous to that of the voice. \\n \\n 5. Simplicity of gesture. This is such a character \\n of gesture as appears the natural result of the situation \\n and sentiments ; which is neither carried beyond the \\n just extent of the feeling, through affectation of variety, \\n nor falls short of it through want of confidence. \\n \\n The opposite imperfection is affectation. \\n \\n 6. Grace of gesture. This is the result of all other \\n perfections, arising from a dignified self-possession of \\n mind, and the power of personal exertion, practised \\n into facility after the best models, and according to \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 127 (#137) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 1^7 \\n \\n true taste. To the more particular investigation of \\n this quality a Chapter is devoted. \\n \\n The opposite imperfection is awkwardness. \\n \\n 7. Propriety of gesture, called also truth of gesture, \\n or natural gesture. This consists in the judicious use \\n of gestures best suited to illustrate or to express the \\n sentiment. Propriety of gesture is generally founded \\n on some natural connexion between the sentiment and \\n the action. Significant gestures are strictly connected \\n with the sentiment. \\n \\n The opposite imperfections are false, contradictory, \\n or unsuitable gestures. \\n \\n 8. Precision, or correctness of gesture. This arises \\n from the just preparation, the due force, and the cor- \\n rect timing of the action : when the preparation is nei- \\n ther too much abridged, nor too pompously displayed ; \\n when the stroke of the gesture is made with such a \\n degree of force as suits the character of the sentiment ; \\n and when it is correctly marked on the precise syllable \\n to be enforced. Precision of gesture gives the same \\n effect to action, as neatness of articulation gives to \\n speech. \\n \\n The opposite imperfections are the indecision, un- \\n certainty, and incorrectness arising from vague and \\n sawing gestures, which, far from illustrating, render \\n doubtful the sense of the sentiments which they accom- \\n pany, and distract the spectator. \\n \\n There are three general modes of public speaking, \\n each of which requires a different style of gesture; \\n namely, \\n \\n 1. The Epic. 3. The Colloquial. \\n \\n 2. The Rhetorical. \\n \\n 1. Epic gesture demands every natural and acquired \\n power, on the part of the speaker : to it belong Magni- \\n ficence, Boldness, Energy, Variety, Simplicity, Grace, \\n Propriety, and Precision. The compositions which \\n require epic gesture, in delivery, are tragedy, epic \\n poetry, lyric odes, and sublime description. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 128 (#138) ############################################\\n\\n1 28 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n 2. Rhetorical gesture requires, principally, Energy \\n Variety, Simplicity, and Precision. Grace is desirable , \\n Magnificence is rarely wanting, but may sometimes \\n lave place. Propriety, in a limited sense, should be \\n observed. Boldness is inadmissible ; because the ora- \\n tor is not, like the player, subjected to any unexpected \\n circumstances. He is not, therefore, at liberty to ex- \\n press surprise, or any other passion, by bold gestures \\n or attitudes. \\n \\n 3. Colloquial gesture, when concerned in the higher \\n scenes of polite life, requires, principally, Simplicity \\n and Grace ; Precision will follow of course ; it may oc- \\n casionally demand something of Energy and Variety \\n Magnificence and Boldness are inadmissible. \\n \\n The gesture of the public speaker must vary con- \\n siderably with the different circumstances of his situa- \\n tion, of his sentiments, and of his audience. If the \\n mere information or instruction of his audience be his \\n sole object, as when the evidences of religion and the \\n grounds of Christian duties are to be explained from \\n the pulpit, or w T hen the details of calculation and finance \\n are to be laid before Congress, or when facts are \\n weighed and laws are argued in the courts of justice, \\n his gestures should be of that class which is called dis- \\n criminating gestures. These he should exercise with \\n simplicity and precision. He should strip them of all \\n the parade of preparation, and of the graces of transi- \\n tion, and give them only that degree of variety which \\n shall guard them against disgusting sameness. This \\n is far removed from theatrical gesture ; it rather ap- \\n proaches the colloquial style. Nothing could be more \\n incongruous than for a public speaker, in either of the \\n foregoing situations, to introduce the parade and mag- \\n nificence of theatrical gesture. The charge which is \\n sometimes made against public speakers, of being thea- \\n trical in their gesture, probably arises more from some \\n unsuitableness in their manner to the matter, than from \\n any thing of uncommon majesty, boldness, or grace in \\n their action. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 129 (#139) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 129 \\n \\n When the public speaker aims at persuasion, as in \\n discourses from the pulpit for public charities, or on \\n extraordinary occasions in Congress, or at the bar, \\n when the advocate desires to influence the opinions of \\n a jury, he will naturally use more graceful, more flow- \\n ing, and more varied gesture. But he should not fail \\n into the action of the theatre. He may be graceful, \\n but he should be simple ; he may be energetic, but he \\n should not affect gestures too strongly significant, much \\n less attempt surprise by attitudes. All his gestures \\n should be regulated by manly decorum, suitable to his \\n situation, to the character of his hearers, and to the \\n just expression of his sentiments. \\n \\n CHAPTER XII. \\n \\n SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. \\n \\n The most important of the significant gestures are \\n the following : \\n \\n The Head and Face. \\n \\n The hanging down of the head denotes shame, or \\n grief. \\n \\n The holding of it up, pride or courage. \\n \\n To nod forwards implies assent. \\n \\n To toss the head back, dissent. \\n \\n The inclination of the head implies diffidence or lan- \\n guor. \\n \\n The head is averted, in dislike or horror. \\n \\n ft leans forward, in attention. \\n \\n The Eyes. \\n \\n The eyes are raised, in prayer. \\n \\n They weep, in sorrow. \\n \\n They burn, in anger. \\n \\n They are downcast -or averted, in shame or grief \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 130 (#140) ############################################\\n\\n130 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n They are cast on vacancy, in thought. \\n \\n They are cast in various directions, in doubt and \\n anxiety. \\n \\n The Arms. \\n \\n The placing of the hand on the head, indicates pain \\n or distress. \\n \\n On the eyes, shame or sorrow. \\n \\n On the lips, an injunction of silence. \\n \\n On the breast, an appeal to conscience. \\n \\n The hand is waved, or flourished, in joy or contempt \\n \\n Both hands are held supine, or they are applied, 01 \\n clasped, in prayer. \\n \\n Both are held prone, in blessing. \\n \\n They are clasped, or wrung, in affliction. \\n \\n They are held forward, and received, in friendship. \\n \\n The Body. \\n The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage. \\n Thrown back, pride. \\n \\n Stooping forward, condescension or compassion. \\n Bending, reverence or respect. \\n Prostration, the utmost humility or abasement. \\n \\n The Lower Limbs. \\n The firm position of the lower limbs signifies courage, \\n or obstinacy. \\n \\n Bended knees indicate timidity, or weakness. \\n \\n The lower limbs advance, in desire or courage. \\n \\n They retire, in aversion or fear. \\n \\n Start, in terror. \\n \\n Stamp, in authority or anger. \\n \\n Kneel, in submission and prayer. \\n \\n These are a few of the simple gestures which may \\n be termed significant. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 131 (#141) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. \\n \\n 131 \\n \\n COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. \\n \\n Complex Significant Gestures are employed chiefly in \\n dramatic representation. They are combinations of \\n simple significant gestures, variously associated accord- \\n ing to the mingled passions which they represent. The \\n boldest and most magnificent of them are termed atti- \\n tudes. The following are examples of complex signifi- \\n cant gestures : \\n \\n Reproach puts on a stern aspect : the brow is con- \\n tracted, the lip is turned up with scorn, and the whole \\n body is expressive of \\n aversion. Fig. 166 \\n represents Queen Ka- \\n tharine, in the trial \\n scene, in the play of \\n Henry VIII. reproach- \\n ing Wolsey for the in- \\n juries which had been \\n neaped upon her. \\n \\n Apprehension is the \\n prospect of future evil \\n accompanied with un- \\n easiness of mind. Fig. \\n 167 is a good example. \\n It represents Hamlet \\n \\n in the act of exclaiming, \"Ay, there\\'s the rub.\\' \\n Hamlet\\'s Soliloquy, p. 249.] \\n \\n Terror excites the person who suffers under it, to \\n avoid the dreaded object, or to escape from it. If it be \\n some dangerous reptile on the ground, and very neai, \\n the expression is represented by starting back and look- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 132 (#142) ############################################\\n\\n132 \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n ing downwards. If the danger threaten from a dis- \\n tance, the terror arising is expressed by looking for- \\n wards, and not starting back, but merely in the retired \\n position. But if the dread of impending death from \\n the hand of an enemy awaken this passion, the coward \\n flies. Of this there is a fine example in the battles of \\n \\n Alexander, by \\n LeBrun. Fig. \\n 168represents \\n terror as de- \\n scribed by En- \\n gel. It is that \\n of a man a- \\n 1 a.r m e d by \\n lightning and \\n thunder.

But among the writers who have \\n treated particularly of significant gestures, none have \\n written with greater ingenuity than Engel : we will \\n borrow, therefore, an example or two from him. \\n \\n Surprise causes the body and lower limbs to retire \\n and affection stimulates the person to advance. (Fig. \\n 108.) The figure represents Frederick de Reuss, in a \\n German play, who unexpectedly sees his dear friend. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 136 (#146) ############################################\\n\\n136 \\n \\n GESTURE. \\n \\n He withdraws, in surprise, his body and lower limbs, \\n Riid, in the ardour of friendship, immediately stretches \\n forwards his head and his arms. \\n \\n When the thoughts flow without \\n diilicuity or opposition, the move- \\n ment of the limbs is free and direct. \\n But when difficulties occur, or ob- \\n stacles are discovered, a man either \\n arrests his action entirely, or changes \\n it to something altogether different. \\n The direction of his eyes, and the(ggxi^ \\n action of his head, are also, under ^e*—=* \\n similar circumstances, quite altered. \\n The eyes, instead of moving freely \\n from object to object, become fixed, \\n and the head is thrown back, if be- \\n fore hanging down on the breast. As an example of \\n these effects, M. Engel refers to a scene in a play of \\n Lessing, in which an old gentleman is very much \\n puzzled how to ma- \\n nage, in a situa- \\n tion of great diffi- \\n culty and delicacy. \\n In the commence- \\n ment of his delibe- \\n rations he is repre- \\n sented as in Fig. i09, \\n and in the next pe- \\n riod of them, as in \\n Fig. 110. \\n \\n These examples \\n are introduced by \\n M. Engel to illus- \\n trate his analogous gestures, but they may also be \\n very well applied to illustrate the complex, significant \\n gestures, which are the present subject of investigation. \\n The description which he gives of melancholy, con- \\n trasted with anxiety, is, throughout, eorrect, and full \\n of nice discrimination. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 137 (#147) ############################################\\n\\nE L O C U T I N . \\n \\n 137 \\n \\n Melancholy is a feeble and passive affection ; it is \\n attended by a total relaxation of the muscles, with a \\n mute and tranquil resignation, un- \\n accompanied by opposition either \\n to the cause or the sensibility of \\n the evil. The character, externally, \\n is languor, without motion, the \\n head hanging at the \" side next, the \\n heart,\" the eyes turned upon its \\n object, or, if that is absent, fixed \\n upon the ground, the hands hang- \\n ing down by their own weight, \\n without effort, and joined loosely \\n together. (Fig. 111.) \\n \\n Anxiety is of a different charac- \\n ter; it is restless and active, and \\n manifest by the extension of the muscles ; the eye is \\n filled with fire, the breathing is quick, the motion is \\n hurried, the head is thrown back, the whole body is \\n extended. The sufferer is like a sick \\n man, who tosses incessantly, and finds \\n himself uneasy in every situation. (Fig. \\n 112.) \\n \\n One of the causes of M. Engel\\'s ges- \\n tures of analogy is, as he observes, the \\n \" disposition of the mind to refer intellec \\n tual ideas to external objects. When \\n king Lear recollects the barbarous treat- \\n ment of his daughters, who, in the midst \\n ?[IIL of a stormy night, had exposed his hoary \\n \" head to the inclemency of the weather ; \\n and when he immmediately exclaims \\n \\n O that way madness lies; \\n No more of that, \\n \\n let me shun that \\n \\n <here is not, in reality, any external object from which \\n this unhappy prince should avert his eyes with horror \\n and yet he turns his head away to the side opposite \\n that to which it was directed before, endeavouring, as \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 138 (#148) ############################################\\n\\n138 \\n \\n GESTURE \\n \\n it were, with his hand reversed, to banish that cru^l \\n \\n and afflicting recollection.\" (Fig. \\n 113.) \\n \\n The significant gestures, how- \\n ever numerous and correct, which \\n u great actor makes in the repre- \\n sentation of an entire dramatic \\n character, bear no proportion to \\n the number of those gestures \\n which do not belong to this class, \\n and which are no less necessary, \\n though they are not so splendid \\n a.nd imposing. The painter is \\n struck by the boldest and finest \\n of the significant gestures, which are called attitudes; \\n and he records them : they are the proper objects oi \\n his art ; they are striking, and less evanescent, than the \\n other gestures which pass unnoticed by him, although \\n they make up by far the greater and more important \\n part of the gestures requisite for illustrating the senti- \\n ments. These less prominent gestures give to the de- \\n clamation its precision and force. A slight movement \\n of the head, a look of the eye, a turn of the hand, a ju- \\n dicious pause, or interruption of gesture, or a change \\n of position in the feet, often illuminates the meaning \\n of a passage, and sends it, full of life and warmth, into \\n the understanding. And the perfection of gesture, in \\n a tragedian, will be found to consist more in the skilful \\n management of the less showy action, than in the exhi- \\n bition of the finest attiludes. Attitudes are danger \\n ons to hazard : the whole powers of the man mus\\'„ be \\n wrought up to their highest energy, or they become \\n forced and frigid. Excellent players have been seen, \\n who have never ventured an attitude ; but none, deserv- \\n ing the name of excellence, have ever appeared, whose \\n declamation has been deficient in precision or propriety \\n Where all the solid foundation of just and appropriate \\n action has been laid, attitude, when regulated witn \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 139 (#149) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE \\n \\n 139 \\n \\n taste and discretion, may be added to ornament the su- \\n perstructure ; but, when it is introduced unseasonably, \\n or is overcharged, it is an evidence of deficiency of un- \\n derstanding, as well as of depravity of taste. \\n \\n ATTITUDES OF MRS.

Some are so \\n happily formed that all their motions are graceful ;* \\n and some minds are so noble, that they impart genu- \\n ine grace to the most uncouth forms : both these cases, \\n however, are comparatively rare. \\n \\n Grace, like the ideal beauty of the painter, and of \\n the sculptor, is not commonly to be found in the indi- \\n vidual living model, but to be collected from the various \\n excellencies of the many. \\n \\n Neither true grace, nor consummate eloquence, can \\n be acquired by those who are totally deficient in natu- \\n ral qualifications; yet they to whom nature has not \\n denied some portion of talents, may improve in both, \\n precisely in proportion to the degree of their application. \\n \\n The grace of oratorical action consists, chiefly, in \\n the facility, the freedom, the variety, and the simplicity \\n of those gestures which illustrate the discourse. \\n \\n Action, to be graceful, should be performed with \\n facility ; because the appearance of great effort is in- \\n compatible with ease, which is a constituent of grace \\n It should also be performed with freedom : no gestures \\n can be graceful which are either confined by external \\n circumstances, or restrained by the mind. If an orator \\n should address an assembly from a narrow window, it \\n \\n * Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, \\n In every action, dignity and love. — Milton. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 148 (#158) ############################################\\n\\n148 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n v^ould be in vain for him to attempt graceful gesture. \\n Confinement, in any less degree, is proportionally in- \\n jurious to grace. Thus, the crowded courts, which \\n impede the motions of the advocate, and the enclosed \\n pulpit, which not unfrequentiy conceals more than half \\n the preacher\\'s figure, are equally injurious to graceful \\n action. Greece, the native soil of manly eloquence \\n and true taste, icas not the originator of the pulpit. \\n \\n The restraint arising from diffidence is also prejudi- \\n cial to grace. It has, however, this advantage — t \\n may be effectually corrected by perseverance. \\n \\n For the maintenance of grace, in rhetorical action, \\n variety is indispensable. The iteration of the same \\n gesture, or set of gestures, however graceful in them- \\n selves, betrays a poverty of resource which is altoge- \\n ther prejudicial to the speaker. \\n \\n Simplicity and truth of manner, if they do not con- \\n stitute grace in themselves, are inseparable from it. \\n Gestures which are manifestly contrived for the mere \\n display of the person, or for the exhibition of some fop- \\n pery, as, for instance, a fine ring, instantly offend. \\n \\n To simplicity of gesture is opposed affectation, which \\n destroys every pretension to genuine grace. The more \\n showy the gestures are, unless they are adapted to the \\n subject, and to the character of the speaker, the more do \\n they offend the judicious by their manifest affectation. \\n When the profligate speaks of piety, the miser of gene- \\n rosity, the coward of valour, and the corrupt of integ- \\n rity, they are only the more despised by those who \\n know them. \\n \\n The faults of manner are analogous to those of cha- \\n racter, and almost equally disgusting : such as the \\n assumption of dignity where there is none in the senti- \\n ment ; pathos, where there is nothing interesting ; vehe- \\n mence in trifles, and solemnity upon common-place \\n subjects. \\n \\n It is an observation founded in fact, that the action \\n of young children is never deficient in grace ; for which \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 149 (#159) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 149 \\n \\n two reasons may be assigned; first, because they are \\n under no restraint from diffidence, or from any other \\n cause, and therefore use their gestures, with ail sin- \\n cerity of heart, only to aid the expression of their \\n thoughts; and, secondly, because they have few ideas \\n of imitation, and consequently are not deprived of \\n natural grace by affectation, nor perverted by bad \\n models. \\n \\n The grace of action, according to Hogarth, consists \\n in moving the body and limbs in that curve which he \\n calls the line of beauty.* When action is considered \\n independent of language and sentiment, this definition \\n will, perhaps, be found generally correct. Rhetorical \\n action, however, derives its grace, not only from the \\n actual motions of the speaker, but also from the con- \\n gruity of his motions with his own character and situa- \\n tion, as well as with the sentiments which he delivers. \\n The dignity which is a becoming grace in a judge, \\n would be quaint affectation in a young advocate ; and \\n the colloquial, but graceful familiarity of action, even \\n of the most polished society, would be highly indeco- \\n rous in the pulpit. Hence, it must be admitted, ac- \\n cording to the just maxim of Cicero and Quintilian, \\n that decorum constitutes true oratorical grace ; and that \\n this decorum admits of great variety of action, under \\n different circumstances. Vehement action is sometimes \\n both decorous and graceful ; so also are abrupt and \\n short gestures, if they bear the impress of truth and \\n suitableness. Such are the gestures of an old man, \\n when he is irritated. But the most flowing and beau- \\n tiful motions, the grandest preparations, and the finest \\n transitions of gesture, ill applied, and out of time, lose \\n their natural character of grace, and become indeco- \\n rous, ridiculous, or offensive. \\n \\n * See Hogarth\\'s Analysis of Beauty. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 150 (#160) ############################################\\n\\n150 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n CHAPTER XIV. \\n \\n SYNOPTICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE NOTATION LETTER9. \\n \\n Letters written above the Line, relating to the Fingets, \\n the Hands, and the Arms. \\n \\n First small Letter, \\n Noting the disposition of the Fingers. \\n \\n n, natural. h, holding. \\n \\n c, clinched. to, hollow. \\n x, extended. ?», thumb. \\n \\n i, index. g, grasping. \\n \\n I, collected. \\n \\n Noting the Manner of presenting the Palm. \\n \\n p, prone. v, vertical. \\n \\n s, supine. /, forwards. \\n \\n w, inwards. b, backwards, \\n \\n o, outwards. \\n \\n Second small Letter, and two Capitals, \\n \\n Noting the Elevation of the Arms. \\n \\n d, downwards.

For this purpose they are divided \\n into four classes ; the notation letters of each always \\n preserve their own place, as to priority, or succession, \\n and derive their signification from it. The first four, \\n or the first three letters, taken together, are called a \\n set of letters. In a set, as phfd, or seq n, \\n \\n The first letter relates to the posture of the hand. \\n \\n The second, to the elevation of the arm. \\n \\n The third, to the transverse situation of the arm. \\n \\n The fourth, to the motion, or force of the gesture.* \\n \\n Thus, phfd is to be read, prone horizontal forward \\n descending. Prone, is the posture of the hand ; hori- \\n zontal, is the elevation of the arm; forward, is the pos- \\n ture of the arm in the transverse direction ; and de- \\n scending, means that the arm descends from a higher \\n elevation. The set, seq n, is read supine elevated oblique \\n noting. Supine, the posture of the hand ; elevated, the \\n arm, as to elevation ; oblique, the arm in the transverse \\n direction ; noting, the action of the hand and arm. \\n \\n As both hands and both arms are equally capable \\n of executing any gesture, the letters, and sets of letters, \\n relate to both indifferently. But they are thus distin- \\n guished : when there are two sets of small letters, the \\n first set denotes the gesture of the right hand and arm ; \\n the second, those of the left. The two sets are sepa- \\n rated by a short dash, thus : phq ■ — pdb, prone horizon- \\n tal oblique, the right hand ; and prone downwards back- \\n wards, the left. \\n \\n When only a single set of three, four, or five smal 1 \\n letters is marked, the gesture of one hand only is ex- \\n pressed ; that of the other is presumed to be easily \\n supplied, according to the rules of accompaniment. A \\n short dash always accompanies a single set of small \\n letters — when the dash follows the letters, they denote \\n the gesture of the right hand ; when the dash precedes \\n the letters, they denote the gesture of the left hand. \\n \\n * This last letter is often omitted. \\n \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 154 (#164) ############################################\\n\\n154 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n When a set of small letters is preceded by a capital \\n B, the gesture which they represent is to be performed \\n by both hands. \\n \\n When a long dash follows the small letters, connect- \\n ing them with other small letters, or with a single one, \\n farther on, a change of gesture is marked, which is to \\n take place on the word over which such letter or let- \\n ters are placed ; and the commencement and termina- \\n tion of the dash mark the commencement and termina- \\n tion of the gesture. \\n \\n When a set of small letters, having a dash, is con- \\n nected by a line of dots with another set of small letters, \\n having a contrary dash, the gesture made by the first \\n hand is to be followed and supported by another ges- \\n ture made by the other hand, which is to take place \\n where the second set of letters is marked. This is \\n called alternate gesture, and noted al. \\n \\n In order to prevent, confusion, the postures of the \\n head, and the direction of the eyes, are indicated by \\n capital letters near the beginning of the sentence, or at \\n some distance from the letters relating to the hands \\n and arms. \\n \\n The letters which mark the positions of the feet, and \\n the steps, are placed below the line, and under the word \\n where they should take place. \\n \\n THE MISER AND PLUTUS. \\n \\n (GAY.) \\n R BvJifr q peq n—pdq \\n \\n 1 . 2.

I \\n \\n Remarks on the Notation of the Miser and Plutus. \\n \\n For the convenience of reference, the piece is divided into sec- \\n tions, by vertical bars, and the number of each section is printed in \\n the margin. \\n \\n (1.) The direction of motion, expressed by the 4th small letter, \\n r, means that from the position in which both hands are presented, \\n vhf, they should move towards the right, and stop at the position, \\n oblique, as noted by q, connected by a dash to the position mentioned. \\n \\n (2.) The 4th small letter, n, signifies noting - . \\n \\n (12.) The posture of the hands is, at first, folded horizontal for- \\n wards, as expressed in the notation, Id hf. At the a, connected \\n by a dash, which signifies ascending, the hands are raised up, and \\n at the next notation, Id br, they are forcibly withdrawn back on the \\n breast. \\n \\n (21.) This posture begins horizontal, as first noted, Bvhf, and \\n ends elevated, B vef; but the B is omitted over the word, weak, \\n being understood by the connecting dash. \\n \\n (25.) The 3d small letter, relating to the transverse direction of \\n the arm, is often placed alone, but connected by a dash with a pre \\n ceding set of letters, as already observer (1.) In such case it is to \\n be understood that the posture of the hands remains as before, and \\n that the transverse direction of the arm only is changed. Here \\n each arm passes through the whole semicircle, from tie position \\n across to extended. \\n \\n The fourth, and the fifth small letter, which relates to the direc- \\n tion and manner of motion, are also often separated, in this manner \\n from the position to which they belong, in order that the place of \\n the motion, or action, may be the more distinctly marked. (See 9, \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 157 (#167) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 157 \\n \\n 15 ahd 20, in which n is thus separated, to point out the particular \\n eyllable on which the action of noting falls ) \\n \\n The action of the hands and arms, at No. 15 and 20, is the same, \\n but the general effect is different, in consequence of the difference \\n in the positions of the feet. In the preparation for these gestures, \\n the palms of both hands are raised so as almost to touch the fore- \\n head ; then they descend gradually, and when the arms are a little \\n below the horizontal elevation, the wrists make that particular \\n motion called noting, on the respective words, stores and cheat. \\n \\n (26.) Left foot first position extended. To make this position \\n extended, the left foot is advanced, the body at the same time is \\n thrown back, and sinks a little, bending the right knee. \\n \\n (28.) This gesture, Bvhf rj, both vertical horizontal forwards \\n rejecting, is thus made : both hands are drawn backwards, nearly \\n to the mouth, in the vertical position ; the eyes, at this time, are \\n directed forwards, the hands are then pushed forwards, while the \\n face is averted, and the feet retire, to a greater or less extent, in \\n proportion to the degree of disgust or abhorrence to be expressed. \\n \\n AN ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-YARD. \\n (GRAY.) \\n \\n I. \\n \\n Ls veq — vhx a Bpef d \\n \\n The curfew tolls — the knell of parting day! \\n am \\n \\n F phf— q * \\n \\n The lowing herd winds slowly o\\'er the lea ; \\n \\n rR\\\\ \\n \\n -phf- \\n \\n The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, \\n \\n V Brief d BR \\n \\n And leaves the world to darkness, and to me. \\n ii. \\n \\n R Bphc ■ \\n \\n Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, \\n \\n Bvef \\n \\n And all the air a solemn stillness holds \\n \\n Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight, \\n \\n vefrt Pjifp— R \\n \\n And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds. \\n \\n aR2 \\n 11 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 158 (#168) ############################################\\n\\n158 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n m. \\n \\n — ieq n \\n \\n Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower \\n m \\n \\n — veq U — seb \\n \\n The moping owl does to the moon complain \\n \\n rLl \\n \\n — shq \\n \\n Of such as, wandering near her secret bower, \\n \\n — veq \\n \\n Molest her ancient, solitary reign. \\n \\n IV. \\n \\n shf 71 — .... — shf n \\n \\n Beneath those rugged elms, that yew tree\\'s shade \\n \\n Bbdf a vhf \\n \\n Where heaves the turf in many a mould\\'ring heap \\n \\n Bnefsp \\n \\n Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, \\n \\n F Bphf d BR \\n \\n The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. \\n v. \\n \\n shf — veq w — \\n \\n The breezy call of incense-breathing morn, \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n The swallow, twitt\\'ring from the straw-built shed, \\n \\n idq — veq w — \\n \\n The cock\\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, \\n \\n Bnefsp Bsdfd \\n \\n No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed, \\n \\n aR2 \\n VI. \\n \\n shf — \\n \\n For them no more the blazing hearth shall burrs, \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n vhf — \\n \\n Or busy housewife ply her evening care, \\n \\n Bshfp \\n \\n Nor children run to lisp their sire\\'s return, \\n \\n aR2 \\n \\n Bnefa D F Bskfn \\n \\n Or climb his knees, the envied kiss to share \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 159 (#169) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 15 9 \\n \\n VII. \\n \\n phc \\n \\n Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield; \\n \\n sdfst — \\n \\n Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has brok> ; \\n \\n see sw phq sp \\n \\n How jocund did they drive their team afield \\\\ \\n \\n ceb bn chfst \\n \\n How bow\\'d the woods beneath their sturdy strode \\n \\n VIII. \\n \\n ief- ; ihf n — \\n \\n Let not ambition mock their useful toil, \\n \\n rU \\n \\n ^ pe f pdf d — \\n \\n Their homely joys, and destiny obscure : \\n \\n oec - 9 rj \\n \\n Nor grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile, \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n vef d ■ \\n \\n The short, and simple annals of the poor. \\n \\n IX. \\n \\n vef sp — ief fl — \\n \\n The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow\\'r, \\n \\n aR2 \\n \\n Bshf p q \\n \\n And all that beauty, ail that wealth e\\'er gave, \\n \\n B vhq sh \\n \\n Await, alike, the inevitable hour — \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n a . ve f a d, sdq n R \\n \\n The paths of glory lead but to the grave. \\n \\n am \\n \\n X. \\n \\n Bphc q a shf n — \\n \\n Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault, \\n \\n If mem\\'ry o\\'er their tomb no trophies raise, \\n \\n L2 \\n \\n vhfp — sec q \\n \\n Where, thro\\' the long-drawn aisle, and fretted vault, \\n \\n a — B nef a d BR \\n \\n The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 160 (#170) ############################################\\n\\n160 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n XI. \\n \\n ihf— — vhq n \\n \\n Can storied urn, or animated bust, \\n \\n rRl \\n \\n Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?

First Line. Ls, listening-. (See complex signifi- \\n cant gestures.) The small «, over knell, is connected with the set \\n of letters, B pef, over parting ; and the small d, over day, is also \\n connected with the same set. Each is considered a fourth small \\n letter, separated from its &et ; a denotes the preparation, and d, the \\n termination of the motion of the gesture. Second line. The set \\n of letters, phd, relates to the right hand, which finishes its action \\n at x, and falls slowly to rest. Third line. Here the left hand \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 162 (#172) ############################################\\n\\n162 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n takes up the principal gesture. This is called alternate gesture. \\n Both hands unite their action on weary. Fourth Line. V, the \\n eyes bent on vacancy. \\n \\n (Stanza II.) The several gestures which are connected toge- \\n tner by long dashes, are to be considered as the flowing variation of \\n continued motion, till either one, or both hands fall to rest. Ges- \\n tures, thus connected, maybe called continuous; they are gene- \\n rally of that kind which are styled discriminating gestures. First \\n line. The posture, Bphc, on fades, is the preparation for sweep- \\n ing round the horizon. Whilst the hands are proceeding to the \\n position, Bphc, the head and eyes should turn towards either ex- \\n treme ; and whilst the arms are moving from this to the different \\n positions, q and x, the head and eyes should move to the other ex- \\n treme. In cases where the right hand performs the principal ac- \\n tion, the head should follow its motion ; in other words, it should \\n turn from left to right, and vice versa. Third line. The left hand \\n drops here, and the index-finger of the right hand is prepared to \\n point across. The eye should follow the object at which the finger \\n seems to point, as at a flying beetle. \\n \\n (Stanza III.) In order to vary the gestures, and the better to \\n distribute the objects in the picture, the tower is supposed to be \\n placed on the left side, and the left hand assumes the principal ges- \\n ture; this is indicated, in the notation, by the short dash which \\n precedes the set of letters. Fourth line. \" Ancient, solitary\" \\n Nouns, or, substantives, may be considered as the outlines, or im- \\n ages of things; adjectives, as the colouring, or circumstances added \\n to those images, or limitations deducting something from them. In \\n poetical language they are called epithets. Gray has indulged in \\n the use of them, perhaps to a fault. But however that may be, \\n whenever they occur, they almost constantly rob the principal image, \\n or substantive, of its emphatic distinction, and claim it for themselves ; \\n perhaps, because the circumstances alone give individuality to the \\n image, which, in itself, is a general term. For these reasons, the \\n action, or gesture, falls rather on the epithet; and, if two, or more \\n epithets are added to the same image, each should be distinctly \\n marked, both by emphasis and action: if so pronounced, they serve \\n to illustrate the idea; but if they are hurried over, they cause only \\n confusion. Therefore, the words ancient solitary reign, require \\n two gestures, one on each epithet. But, to avoid affectation, the \\n transition should be the easiest possible ; and this will be when the \\n gesture on the preceding word is made the preparation for that on \\n the subsequent. When two epithets are applied to a name, the \\n latter should be the stronger; and in this view, also, it is proper to \\n reserve the emphatic gesture for it, as the principal. \\n \\n (Stanza IV.) First line. On elms, the right hand again re- \\n sumes the principal gesture. It is here alternate, or auxiliary, as \\n appears from the dotted line of connexion. Second line. On heaves \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 163 (#173) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 163 \\n \\n the backs of the hands are presented forwards, the hands hanging \\n down, and in the action they ascend gradually towards vertical eleva- \\n ted, on the word mouldering. Third line. \" Each in his narrow cell \\n for ever laid ;\" the arms gradually ascend to the highest point, on the \\n word ever, and then, in the same manner, descend, to rest on the \\n word sleep, making, in their progress, a momentary arrest on the \\n word forefathers. It seems to be an incongruity to raise the arms, \\n in speaking of the grave, which is below ; but this is removed by \\n the downward inclination of the head, and look of the eyes, as noted ; \\n and it is not uncommon to elevate the arms in looking into any \\n thing dreadful below. This is also the preparation for the following \\n gesture, which requires the arms to fall to rest. From the third \\n line to the end of the stanza the gestures are continuous. \\n \\n (Stanza V.) First line. On breathing the graceful wave is \\n marked. The wave may be considered of three kinds, the graceful, \\n the wave of triumph (which, in a less degree, is also the wave of \\n joy), and the wave of scorn, or contempt. The subject will always \\n sufficiently determine the character to be adopted, though the no- \\n tation is the same for all. Second line. On swallow, the index is \\n raised, to point out the object ; on twittering it ascends to the high- \\n est point in the range of gesture, or is retracted, so as almost to \\n touch the head, and then on the word straw-built it makes the ac- \\n tion of noting. Third line. The joyful wave, approaching to tri- \\n umph, should be made on echoing ; the voice should here mark the \\n crescendo, which will be contrasted with the gravity of the follow \\n ing line. Fourth line. In order to perform the action of springing, \\n indicated by sp, the arms begin to ascend from more, and having \\n arrived at the word rouse, the wrists make on it the stroke of the \\n gesture by springing suddenly into the elevated position. \\n \\n (Stanza VI.) Fourth line. The gesture on climb is a suspend- \\n ing gesture, preparatory to that on kiss. The eyes look downwards \\n on climb, and forwards on kiss. The ends of the fingers approach \\n the mouth a little on kiss, after which the hands are advanced su- \\n pine noting. \\n \\n (Stanza VII.) Second line. The preparation for the gesture \\n on stubborn is neq rt, and would fall on oft, but is here omitted as \\n taking place, of course, when the gesture marked on stubborn is \\n executed. It will be observed that several emphatic gestures im- \\n ply a proper suspending, or preparatory gesture, and reciprocally, \\n the latter the former. Thus, when a stroke is required to be made, \\n the arm must, of course, be raised ; therefore, shf st must necessa- \\n rily imply nefbn, inwards elevated forwards bending ; veq w im- \\n plies, bhf a, backwards horizontal forwards ascending ; and vhxrj, \\n implies, vhx rt, vertical horizontal extended retracting. In the \\n notation, the preparatory gestures are often omitted, when they arc \\n not required to make a preceding less emphatic word ; in which \\n case they are prepared with less decision, and their stroke is soft- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 164 (#174) ############################################\\n\\n164 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n cried. When the suspending-, or preparatory gesture is used as the \\n principal, as in terror, where the arms are retracted violently, and \\n in surprise, where they are elevated forcibly, the subsequent ges- \\n ture is also softened ; and the emphasis of its stroke is remitted. \\n Fourth line. Should woods not be pronounced with a strong em- \\n phasis, the notation over this word might be omitted. \\n \\n (Stanza VIII.) The first gesture in each of the first three \\n lines of this stanza, is a preparatory gesture, of the decisive kind, \\n and the last, in each, emphatic. As all the words which are noted \\n are important, each requires the enforcement of gesture; and the \\n connexion of suspending, or preparatory and emphatic gestures, \\n renders the transitions easy and unaffected. Second line. The \\n noun, destiny, being here placed before its adjective, or epithet, \\n may obtain both the emphasis and action ; they might, also, be re- \\n served for the epithet obscure. Fourth line. \"• Short and simple ;\" \\n the first epithet is distinguished by a slight discriminating gesture, \\n produced by a small change in the elevation of the arm and hand, \\n marked a. This is made the commencement of the gesture vef, \\n which is completed by a suspending gesture on simple, and which \\n descends to rest on the word poor, with an emphatic and terminat- \\n ing gesture. \\n \\n (Stanza IX.) First line. The flourish is marked on power. \\n The flourish, as expressed in Fig. 88, is performed principally by \\n the wrist. In order to perform this action, the hand, with the in- \\n dex-finger, is dropped down a little above the head, nearly at right \\n angles with the fore-arm, and is then thrown forcibly upwards, and \\n sweeps round as marked by the line of dots in the figure. To ad- \\n vance boldly, indicates confidence, pride, &c. ; to advance slowly, \\n implies solemnity, grief, resignation, &c. The notation is the same, \\n in each case, as the sentiments sufficiently show in what manner \\n the speaker should advance. Of the former (bold advance), an in \\n stance is observed on the word power, in this line; of the latter \\n (slow advance), an instance is seen on the word grave, in the last \\n line. Third line. The shake, sh, is marked on inevitable. It \\n should not comprise many tremulous motions, lest it appear ridicu- \\n lous ; it is sufficient that the hand move twice suddenly backwards \\n and forwards. Fourth line. The gestures in this line are continu- \\n ous. The first, on paths, is a discriminating gesture, leading to \\n the suspending gesture, on glory. The gesture on lead, is the pre- \\n paration for that which descends to the word grave, on which falls \\n the emphatic and terminating gesture. The advance, noted in this \\n line, aR2, for the step, combines with the descending arms, and aids \\n in looking down with resignation. But it might be r/21, or rIA % \\n which would express terror, or alarm. / prefer aR2. \\n \\n (Stanza XL) Second line. From back, both hands (the palma \\n inwards), move inwards, so that at mansion they nearly touch tha \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 165 (#175) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 165 \\n \\n lips, as noted ; they then move outwards to the position oblique, on \\n the word fleeting. \\n \\n (Stanza Xll.) Third line. There is a suspending gesture on \\n hands, which is the preparation for the subsequent gesture. It \\n might have been omitted, as it is obviously implied, were it not \\n thought proper to mark the word hands with some force ; and, in \\n this way, it obtains the distinction of gesture without extravagance \\n or unnecessary waste of gesture. Were this preparatory gesture \\n not marked, the hands would ascend, by a uniform motion, to rod, \\n then make the stroke on empire, which would be feeble, and, if \\n noted at large, would be thus : \\n \\n B shfst \\n \\n Hands that the rod of empire might have sway\\'d. \\n \\n Fourth line. The double sweep is here performed — first inwards, \\n on ecstasy, and then outwards, on lyre. \\n \\n (Stanza XIII.) The gesture on penury is a suspending one; \\n its fourth and its fifth letter, rp, which express the manner of mo- \\n tion, being separated, in order to place them over their proper syl- \\n lable. The notation, at large, would be as follows : \\n \\n _ B vhf rt B v/if rp \\n \\n Chill penury repressed, &c. \\n \\n The first retracting, the last repressing ; this, however, is under- \\n stood from the nature of the emphatic gesture. Fourth line. The \\n fourth small letter, c, over froze, signifies contracted. The gesture \\n on current serves as a preparation for placing the hands on the \\n breast. This gesture, Bnhfp, begins on genial, and the arms are \\n stretched out, with some force, on current. \\n \\n (Stanza XIV.) Third line. On the won] flower, shfrt might \\n be placed, as the preparation for the gesture on blush; but as the \\n word does not require a strong emphasis, the notation is omitted; \\n however, the gesture is implied. (See remarks on Stanza VII.) \\n \\n (Stanza XV.) Fourth line. When from the transverse posi- \\n tion, c, the arms move directly to x, without noting the interme- \\n diate position, q, as here, on country\\'s blood, the motion is under- \\n stood to be rapid, and decisive, expressing vehemence or horror. \\n \\n (Stanza XVI.) Second line. The gestures necessary to be \\n marked, on this line, are four, of which the second, on pain, and \\n the third, on ruin, are made by the momentary arrest of the hand, \\n in its ascent to vef, on the first syllable of despise ,- rj* rejecting, on \\n the last syllable, finishes the whole with the emphatic stroke. \\n Thus sufficient discrimination is made, without falling into quaint- \\n ness of gesture, or affectation. These small discriminating ges- \\n tures, produced by a slight arrest of motion, and often by merely \\n changing the posture of the hand, are more frequent, and more im \\n portant to the orator, than the more showy gestures, and should be \\n particularly attended to. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 166 (#176) ############################################\\n\\n166 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n (Stanza. XVII.) The last two lines have each a series of con- \\n tinuous gestures. \\n \\n From the preceding- analysis and notation, it will be observed that \\n the discriminating gestures are principally requisite for the recit- \\n ing of this poem. The suspending and the emphatic are frequent; \\n but the last seldom require to be strongly marked, as the general \\n character of the sentiments is calm and tender. Of significant \\n gestures there are very few. The first, marked Ls, listening, over \\n curfew, is of this class, and perhaps a few others may also be \\n reckoned to belong to it, as when the hand is laid on the breast; but \\n there are not many more. \\n \\n As these gestures may be varied, it may be said, infinitely, so \\n there can be no fixed standard, as to the manner of delivering this, \\n or any other poem, or oration, which should be considered exclusively \\n appropriate. The sentiments require, indeed, to be delivered with \\n suitable tones of voice, and expression of countenance; but great \\n variety of gesture may be consistent with propriety, provided gene- \\n ral rules are not violated : as, that decorum and simplicity be ob- \\n served; that the transitions, connexions, the time of the gesture, \\n and precision in the stroke, be attended to, and other obvious precau- \\n tions, of general import, already sufficiently detailed. The notation \\n will accommodate itself to every variety in the speaker\\'s manner; \\n and this must prove a recommendation to its use. \\n \\n THE SPEECH OF BRUTUS ON THE DEATH OP C^JSAR. \\n \\n (SHAKSPEARE.) \\n B shfp q vex sp B nef \\n \\n Romans, countrymen, and lovers ! hear me for \\n \\n aR2 rRl \\n \\n B shf st pef — phx phf st— R \\n \\n my cause ; and be silent that you may hear. \\n \\n Bshfp br — R br pr — veq sp \\n \\n Believe me for mine honour; and have respect unto \\n \\n aR2 \\n \\n Bshfn D B pef \\n \\n mine honour that you may believe.

These are \\n suited to the vehemence of the speaker\\'s manner, which seeks no \\n ornament, but hastens to produce the main impression on his hearers, \\n by the most direct method. An inspection of the notation will make \\n his evident ; for, even though the reader may wish tr alter many \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 169 (#179) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 169 \\n \\n particular gestures which are here noted, he must change them for \\n others of the same nature, if he would preserve the character of the \\n speech. The suspending and the emphatic gestures must still \\n abound, and he will find little opportunity for introducing the other \\n descriptions, which are, in general, too tame for the abrupt and ve- \\n hement style of this speech. \\n \\n \" Be silent that you may hear. 1 \\'\\' On these words I have marked \\n the gesture for the left hand, as well as that for the right, and also \\n on the words, \" have respect unto mine honour.\\'\\'\\'\\' This last is an \\n auxiliary gesture, but of the vehement kind. The exordium of this \\n singular oration ends at \" better judge ;\" after which, the arms \\n should fall to rest, and there should be a considerable pause. An- \\n other division, which may be called the proposition, takes place at \\n \"live all freemen \" another, the narration, at \"death for his am- \\n bition \" and that which may be called the pathetic, or appeal to \\n the passions, finishes at \" I pause for a reply.\\'*\\'\\' The argument, or \\n reasoning, ends at \" suffered death ;\" and the peroration follows. \\n \\n \" I weep for him?* This is noted E — R, the right hand on the \\n eyes, the left at rest. \\n \\n \"Him have I offended \" noted on \"him, 1 \\'\\' ihfrc, recoiling. In \\n this action the finger is pointed suddenly, and scornfully ; then im- \\n mediately withdrawn. \\n \\n Frequent changes in the positions of the feet indicate anxiety ; \\n they are, therefore, noted, in this speech. \\n \\n \"His body, mourned;\" auxiliary gesture. When the right \\n hand is brought up on \" mourned,\\'\\'\\'\\' both hands become supine ; and, \\n on the next words, \" by Mark Antony,\" they make the action of \\n noting. At \"Here comes,\" noted B, the speaker looks back; at \\n \" Mark Antony,\" noted F, he looks forward to those whom he ad- \\n dresses. It would be tedious to point out all the suspending ges- \\n tures, succeeded immediately by the emphatic, for they abound. \\n In all the antitheses, which are numerous, the suspending will be \\n found over the first member, and the emphatic over the last. \\n \\n EXTRACT FROM YOUNG S NIGHT THOUGHTS. \\n \\n U vefn F B nef \\n \\n The bell strikes one.

He heaps them profusely, \\n and in every manner, on the principal idea. Man is here his sub- \\n ject, which he colours with every variety of tint, exhibits in every \\n light, and touches and re-touches almost to disgust. And yet he \\n has here produced many sublime images ; and his very faults, his \\n labour, his antitheses and his catachreses,* are the source of his \\n beauties. This passage is particularly difficult to recite. The dif- \\n \\n * Catachresis, a figure of speech by which one word is abusive^? \\n put for another. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 172 (#182) ############################################\\n\\n172 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n ficnlty arises cbiefiy from the multiplicity of the images, and the \\n brevity of the expression ; consequently, if the speaker is not care- \\n ful to pronounce every line with due deliberation, his gesture makes \\n confusion only, and gives an air of mummery to his recitation. \\n This condensation of images occurs in almost every line ; but the \\n twenty -sixth line, which consists of only four words, is remarkable. \\n \" Helpless immortal ! insect infinite !\" \\n \\n To give force and variety, and, at the same time, simplicity and \\n gracefulness to gestures so heaped on each other, is attended with \\n no inconsiderable difficulty. But even should the speaker\\'s manner, \\n in the recitation of these lines, prove unexceptionable in this re- \\n spect, the difficulty is but half conquered. They do not, indeed, \\n require any considerable variety of voice; but the eye and the coun- \\n tenance of the speaker must be full of expression and intelligence: \\n he must appear to be rapt in meditation, which rises into sublimity \\n as it proceeds, and inflames, as it catches the rapid succession of \\n thought. On these accounts, this passage is seldom recited suc- \\n cessfully. \\n \\n After what has been said in the analysis of the other pieces, a \\n few observations will suffice for this. \\n \\n Line 4, \"aright,\" continuous gesture to the end of the 5th line, \\n where the hand falls to rest with some degree of force, noted R st, \\n rest, striking. The hand, generally, in falling to rest, drops quietly \\n and imperceptibly by its own gravity, and it is then noted with a \\n simple R ; but sometimes the hand is struck down forcibly, and then \\n it is noted, as above, R st. \\n \\n Line 8. \" How much ;\" the x, in the fourth place, means that \\n the arms are to be extended forwards eagerly. \\n \\n Line 14, 15, 16, six epithets, antithesis, and a climax: the voice \\n and gesture must increase in energy, and on \" Ae,\" in the 16th line, \\n complete the climax. The first, in each pair of gestures, is pre- \\n paratory to the subsequent, in the antithesis. \\n \\n Line 23 to 25. Antitheses and catachreses heaped on each \\n other, each requiring a separate gesture, strongly contrasted with \\n that to which it is opposed. \\n \\n Line 29. F st, the hand striking the forehead. \\n \\n GENERAL REMARKS. \\n \\n In order to render every circumstance perfectly intelligible, I have \\n marked with the notation letters the gestures in the preceding ex- \\n amples more minutely than is necessary for general use. For gene- \\n ral use, it is sufficient to note the most important circumstances, \\n leaving the filling up to the judgment of the speaker. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 173 (#183) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 173 \\n \\n In the recitation of descriptions of any kind, the speaker must, in \\n imagination, have the picture before his eyes, and each object must \\n be disposed in the same order as if actually painted. If this imagi- \\n nary picture be faulty in the composition, confused, or ill-grouped \\n the gesture will perplex, rather than enlighten ; but, if well con- \\n ceived, and well disposed in its parts, the speaker will seem to give \\n it the interest of life by his skilful gesture and recitation; and the \\n puditor will almost imagine that he actually contemplates all that \\n the speaker describes. \\n \\n Impassioned compositions, delivered with proper feeling and ex- \\n pression, open, in like manner, to the view of the hearer, the inter- \\n nal operations of the speaker\\'s mind, — a contemplation still more \\n interesting than any scenes of external nature which can be pre- \\n sented in description. \\n \\n As, in writing, even an appropriate term must not be used too \\n frequently, so in this art, the same gesture, however expressive, \\n must not be too often repeated. Variety is graceful, and requires \\n that similar gestures, as well as similar words, should be separated \\n b.v those which are diverse. \\n \\n In oratorical action, it is a general rule that each new idea requires \\n a new gesture. But important ideas, only, require distinguished \\n gesture. For these last, therefore, should be reserved the species of \\n gestures named emphatic; for the former (which are the most nu- \\n merous), the discriminating will be sufficient. As to frequency, the \\n propriety of gesture will be found to depend on the deliberation and \\n expression of the speaker. If the feelings are not alive, and if the \\n lines are not pronounced with due deliberation, the gestures will \\n appear to be too numerous. In the preceding examples they may \\n seem to have this fault, from the circumstance that it is my object \\n to exhibit at large the greater part of their minute connexions and \\n transitions. A little attention, however, will show, that much, \\n still, has been left to be supplied by the judgment of the reader. \\n \\n The notation, and the analytical observations on the foregoing \\n pieces, will, it is conceived, afford sufficient information to such as \\n may desire to assist their rhetorical studies by this system. I would \\n not recommend that the young speaker, in using this notation, should \\n mark every possible passage in his discourse, in the manner of these \\n examples; for such minuteness would lead to embarrassment, un- \\n less preceded by much labour. The utmost advisable notation \\n should not exceed a few marks on particular passages, and those \\n separated from each other; the filling up of which should be trusted \\n to the feelings of the moment. But the best method, in all re- \\n spects, for acquiring a finished rhetorical delivery, is the private \\n practice of declamation, which is supported on the authority of the \\n great masters and models of oratory, Demosthenes and Cicero. The \\n aspiring rhetorical student should select one or more celebrated \\n orations, couched in the style that he wishes to adopt; these he \\n 12 \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 174 (#184) ############################################\\n\\n174 ELOCUTION. \\n \\n should carefully subject to all the rules of notation ; he should study \\n them, and commit them to memory ; he will exercise on them all \\n the powers of his voice, his countenance and gesture ; and, like De- \\n mosthenes, consult his mirror, and obtain the opinion of a judicious \\n friend on his performances. The knowledge and facility, which, \\n by repeated exercises of this kind, he will acquire in rhetorical \\n delivery, may be transferred, with advantage, to his own composi- \\n tions which are to be delivered in public; and, without hazarding \\n the inconveniences of particular notation, he will find himself pos- \\n sessed of such a store of various, forcible, and expressive action, \\n that, whatever his feelings shall suggest at the moment, he will be \\n able to execute in a satisfactory manner. \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 175 (#185) ############################################\\n\\nGESTURE. 175 \\n \\n QUESTIONS \\n \\n TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PUPIL. \\n \\n ELOCUTION. \\n \\n Page 15.

In such cases, I have found it ne- \\n cessary, in order to break up established habits, and direct the voice, \\n as it were, into a new channel, to institute exercises in which the \\n pitch and force of the voice are varied in the wildest and most ex- \\n travagant manner. For instance, I select some piece, and divide it \\n into sections. The first of these sections I pronounce in the falsetto \\n voice, and request the pupil, or, what is better, the whole class, to \\n pronounce it in like manner; the second section I pronounce in the \\n lowest note of the natural voice, and it is immediately repeated by \\n the class ; the third, in the highest note of the natural voice ; the \\n fourth in a whisper; the fifth, in the medium pitch of the natural \\n voice; and so on.

Meanwhile, two, or more pupils, standing out from the class, \\n may keep time with the dumb-bells. \\n \\n SYLLABLE RHYTHM. \\n \\n 6.

[See the Pre- \\n face.] \\n \\n ( i ) A separation mark. It signifies that the words between \\n which it is placed, should not coalesce. \\n \\n (n) A rest. Where this character is employed there should be \\n a slight suspension of the voice. \\n \\n (-) A hold. The vowels over which this character is placed, \\n should have an unusual prolongation. \\n \\n (o) A pause, called also a suspending pause. When placed over \\n a rest, it signifies that this rest should have two or three times its \\n usual length. It is called a suspending pause, because it keeps \\n the mind of the hearer in suspense. [See an example on page 221, \\n seventh line from the bottom.] \\n \\n ( M / \\\\ \\' * \\' ) Acute and grave accents. They are employed to \\n represent the rising and falling inflections, and also the emphasis \\n melodies. [See page 48 and 54.] \\n \\n (a) Acuto-grave accent, or acuto-grave circumflex. [See p. 48.] \\n \\n (\") Gravo-acute accent, or gravo-acute circumflex. [See p. 48.] \\n \\n (ir) Irony. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, is \\n ironical. \\n \\n (rp) Reproach. When these letters are prefixed to a passage, \\n it contains the language of reproach. \\n \\n (wh) Whisper. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, \\n should be whispered. \\n \\n (1, 2, 3, 4) These numbers represent the degrees of modulation. \\n [See p. 57.] \\n \\n The italic letters represent sounds which are liable to be omitted, \\n or imperfectly articulated. When all the letters in a word are \\n italic, the word is emphatic. The emphatic words, however, are \\n seldom, in this work, marked by italic letters. \\n \\n In designating the pronunciation of words, in the foot-notes, I \\n have used the letters which, on page 19, and 20, represent the ele- \\n ments of the English language. No superfluous letters are em- \\n ployed, as is done by lexicographers. The pronunciation of each \\n word is determined by the letters which represent the sounds of \\n which it is composed, and by the situation of the accent. \\n \\n (216) \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 217 (#227) ############################################\\n\\nPART II. \\n \\n EXERCISES IN READING AND DECLA \\n MATION. \\n \\n SPEECH OF SATAN TO HIS LEGIONS. \\n \\n (MILTON.) \\n \\n Narrative, \\n \\n He scarce had ceas\\'d, | when the superior fiend 1 \\n \\n Was moving tow\\'rd the shores ; | his pond\\'rous shield, | \\n \\n Etherial temper, mas\\'sy, large\\', and round\\', | \\n \\n Behind Aim cas^ ; I the broad circumference a | \\n \\n Hung on Ais shoulders \\\\\\\\ke the moon | whose orb \\n \\n Through optic glass | the Tuscan artist views \\n \\n At evening | from the top of Feso-le, | \\n \\n Or in Valdar no, c l to descry new lands\\', | \\n \\n Riv\\'ers, or mountains/ 1 in her spotty globe. | \\n \\n His spear\\' I (to equal which | the tallest pine,! \\n \\n Hewn on Norwegian hills, | to be the m-dst \\n \\n Of some greaZ amiral, e |were hut a wand\\') | \\n \\n He walk\\'d^ with, | to support uneasy steps | \\n \\n Over the burning marl, I (not like those steps \\n \\n On heaven\\'s a\\'zure ! f ) I and the torrid clime | \\n \\n Smote on him sore besides^ | vaulted with fire v : | \\n \\n Nathless\" he so endur\\'d, I till on the beach \\n \\n Of thai inflamed sea he stood, I and call\\'d \\n \\n His le x gions, | angel-forms | who lay entranc\\'d | \\n \\n a Ser-ktim\\'fe-r£ns. b Gallileo.

It must exist in the man, in the sub- \\n ject and in the occasion. \\n \\n Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of \\n declamation, all may aspire after it : they cannot reach \\n it.

It \\n is to that union we owe our safet}^ at home, and our \\n consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that union \\n that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us \\n most proud of our country. That union we reached, \\n only by the discipline of our virtues in the severe \\n school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities \\n of disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined \\n credit. Under its benign influences, these great inter- \\n ests immediately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang \\n forth with newness of life. Every year of its duration \\n has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its bless- \\n ings ; and, although our territory has stretched out \\n wider and wider, and our population spread farther \\n and farther, they have not outrun its protection or its \\n benefits. It has been to ns all, a copious fountain of \\n national, social, and personal happiness. \\n \\n I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the \\n union, to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess \\n behind. I have not coolly weighed the chances of pre- \\n serving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together \\n shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed my- \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 500 (#510) ############################################\\n\\nI \\n \\n 500 PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. \\n \\n self to hang over the precipice of disunion, to see \\n whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth \\n of the abyss below ; nor could I regard him as a safe \\n counsellor in the affairs of this government, whose \\n thoughts should be mainly bent on considering, not \\n how the union should be preserved, but how tolerable \\n might be the condition of the people, when it shall be \\n broken up and destined. \\n \\n While the union lasts, we have high, exciting, grati- \\n fying prospects spread out before us, for us and our \\n children. Beyond that, I seek not to penetrate the \\n vail. God grant, that in my day, at least, that curtain \\n may not rise. God grant, that on my vision never \\n ma}\\' be opened what lies behind. When my eyes shall \\n be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun in hea- \\n ven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dis- \\n honored fragments of a once glorious union ; on states \\n dissevered, discordant, belligerent ; on a land rent with \\n civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood ! \\n Let their last feeble and lingering glance, rather, be- \\n hold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known \\n and honored throughout the earth, still full high ad- \\n vanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their origi- \\n nal lustre ; not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single \\n star obscured, bearing for its motto, no such miserable \\n interrogatory as, What is all this worth?

The plaintiff, Gentlemen, is a widow; \\n yes, Gentlemen, a widow. The late Mr. Bardell, some \\n time before his death, became the father, Gentlemen, \\n of a little boy. With this little boy, the onl3 r pledge \\n of her departed exciseman, Mrs. Bardell shrunk from \\n the world and courted the retirement and tranquillity of \\n G os well street ; and here she placed in her front parlor- \\n window a written placard, bearing this inscription, — \\n \"Apartments furnished for a single gentleman. \\n Inquire within.\\'\\' \\n \\n Mrs. Bardell\\'s opinions of the opposite sex, Gentle- \\n men, were derived from a long contemplation of \\n the inestimable qualities of her lost husband. She \\n had no fear, — she had no distrust, — all was confidence \\n and reliance. \"Mr. Bardell,\" said the widow, \"was a \\n man of honor, — Mr. Bardell was a man of his word, — • \\n Mr. Bardell was no deceiver, — Mr. Bardell was once a \\n single gentleman himself: to single gentlemen I look \\n for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and conso- \\n lation ; in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see \\n something to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was, \\n w r hen he first won mj T young and untried affections ; \\n to a single gentleman, then, shall my lodgings be let.\" \\n \\n Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse \\n (among the best impulses of our imperfect nature, \\n Gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her \\n tears, furnished her first floor, caught her innocent bojr \\n to her maternal bosom, and put the bill up in her \\n parlor-window. Did it remain there long ? IS\"o.

The subject pre- \\n sents but few attractions ; and I, Gentlemen, am \\n not t v he man, nor are you, Gentlemen, the men, to \\n delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, \\n and of systematic villainy. I say systematic villainy, \\n Gentlemen ; and when I say systematic villainy, let me \\n tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am \\n informed he is, that it would have been more decent in \\n him, more becoming, if he had stopped away. Let me \\n tell him, further, that a counsel, in the discharge of \\n his duty, is neither to be intimidated, nor bullied, nor \\n put down ; and that any attempt to do either the one or \\n the other will recoil on the head of the attempter, be he \\n plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, \\n or Nokes, or Stoaks, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thomp- \\n son. \\n \\n I shall show you, Gentlemen, that for two }^ears \\n Pickwick continued to reside constantly, and without \\n interruption or intermission, at Mrs. Bardell\\'s house. \\n I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole \\n of that time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, \\n cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washer- \\n woman when it went abroad, darned, aired and pre- \\n pared it for wear when it came home, and, in short, \\n enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence. I shall show \\n you that, on many occasions, he gave half-pence, and \\n on some occasions even sixpence, to her little boy. I \\n shall prove to you, that on one occasion, wheu he \\n returned from the country, he distinctly and in terms \\n offered her marriage, — previously, however, taking \\n special care that there should be no witnesses to their \\n solemn contract ; and I am in a situation to prove to \\n \\n\\x0c\\n\\n## p. 546 (#556) ############################################\\n\\n546 PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. \\n \\n you, on the testimony of three of his own friends,— \\n most unwilling witnesses, Gentlemen — most unwilling \\n witnesses, — that on that morning he was discovered \\n by them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing \\n her agitation by his caresses and endearments. \\n \\n And now, Gentlemen, but one word more. Two \\n letters have passed between these parties, — letters that \\n must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye, — \\n letters that were evidently intended, at the time, by \\n Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into \\n whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first : — \\n \" Garraway\\'s, twelve o\\'clock. — Dear Mrs. B. — Chops \\n and Tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick.\" Gentlemen, \\n what does this mean ? Chops and Tomato sauce ! \\n Yours, Pickwick ! Chops! Gracious heavens! And \\n Tomato sauce. Gentlemen, is the happiness of a \\n sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by \\n such shallow artifices as these ? \\n \\n The next has no date whatever, which is in itself \\n suspicious : — \" Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home to- \\n morrow. Slow coach.\" And then follows this very \\n remarkable expression, — \" Don\\'t trouble yourself about \\n the warming-pan.\" The warming-pan ! Wiry, Gentle- \\n men, who does trouble himself about a warming-pan ! \\n Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to \\n agitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is \\n no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire — \\n a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, \\n agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence, \\n artfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his \\n contemplated desertion ? And what does this allusion \\n to the slow coach mean? For aught I know, it may \\n be a reference to Pickwick himself, who has most un- \\n questionably been a criminally slow coach during the \\n whole of this transaction, but whose speed will now be \\n very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, \\n Gentlemen, as he will find to his cost, will very soon \\n be greased by you ! \\n \\n But enough of this, Gentlemen.

Na- \\\\n ture has so constituted him, that \\\\n both body and mind require \\\\n daily exercise to develope their \\\\n powers, and maintain them in a \\\\n vigorous and healthy condition. \\\\n The truth of this remark is \\\\n manifest from constant observation and experience — those \\\\n who lead active, bustling lives, conjoined with temperance \\\\n and prudence, commonly possess robust frames, and healthy \\\\n constitutions; while the sedentary and the indolent are \\\\n enervated and sickly. \\\\n \\\\n We find the same results from the exercise of the mental \\\\n faculties. He whose mind is constantly employed in the \\\\n acquisition of knowledge, usually retains his mental facul- \\\\n ties unimpaired to the last. But not so with the man of ease \\\\n and indolence. After the meridian of life, the powers of his \\\\n mind, with those of the body, become weaker, and weaker, \\\\n and he finally leaves the world as he entered it — a child. \\\\n \\\\n The health and strength of the body, therefore, mainly \\\\n depend on the number of muscles that are frequently called \\\\n into action, and the degree of rational exercise through \\\\n which they pass. Now there are few, if any, whose daily \\\\n avocations are so varied as to bring into requisition all the \\\\n muscles of the body : hence the necessity of gymnastic exer- \\\\n cises. \\\\n \\\\n The term, gymnastics, in its widest sense, signifies all \\\\n bodily exercises ; in a more limited sense, \" exercises syste- \\\\n matically adapted to develope the physical powers, and pre- \\\\n serve them in perfection, which constitutes the art of gym* \\\\n nasties properly so called.\" \\\\n \\\\n («) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 12 (#22) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n12 INTRODUCTION. \\\\n \\\\n These exercises, when commenced in youth, develope the \\\\n muscles, give agility to the limbs, and promote the various \\\\n mnctions of the animal system: in this way they impart \\\\n strength and consistency to the body, and lay the founda- \\\\n tion of lasting health : and even when commenced in man- \\\\n hood, they invigorate the frame, and brace it against the \\\\n infirmities of age. \\\\n \\\\n By the frequent and energetic exercise of the muscles, \\\\n they are brought completely under the control of volition, \\\\n which is a powerful auxiliary to every variety of action. \\\\n Hence Gymnastics are not only useful because they exert a \\\\n healthful influence upon the body ; but because they lay a \\\\n good foundation for the easy acquisition of every mechanic \\\\n art. \\\\n \\\\n From what has been said of Gymnastics in general, it may \\\\n readily be conceived that very important advantages may \\\\n be derived from vocal gymnastics. \\\\n \\\\n By the term, Vocal Gymnastics, may be understood the \\\\n principles of the human voice as employed in speech and \\\\n song, as well as the training of the organs by which this \\\\n voice is produced. The principles are the science of the \\\\n voice — the training, the exercise of the organs, necessary \\\\n to develope their powers, and enable them to act with rapid- \\\\n ity, precision, and effect. \\\\n \\\\n Vocal Gymnastics give the pupil complete command of \\\\n the muscles of articulation, extend the compass of the voice, \\\\n and render it smooth, powerful, and melodious. They not \\\\n only call forth all the energies of the vocal organs, correct \\\\n stammering, lisping, &c. ; but they invigorate the lungs, and, \\\\n consequently, fortify them against the invasion of disease. \\\\n \\\\n All the blood, in the course of its circulation, passes through \\\\n the lungs, where it undergoes a change, not only essential \\\\n to health, but also to life. Whenever their function, there- \\\\n fore, is interrupted by debility, or disease, the blood is dete- \\\\n riorated, and the whole system suffers; in fact, the very \\\\n citadel of life is sapped, and nothing but a restoration of \\\\n these organs to their natural condition, will effect a return \\\\n of general health.

One of the most kopefu! \\\\n expedients for this purpose, is a well-regulated and perse- \\\\n vering course of vocal gymnastics. \\\\n \\\\n Were we to exercise our voices a few minutes, every day, \\\\n according to just principles, the number of deaths from pul- \\\\n monary affections, especially consumption, I have no doubt, \\\\n would be greatly diminished. \\\\n \\\\n While Vocal Gymnastics give a keenness to appetite, they \\\\n are a powerful means of promoting digestion. A young \\\\n clergyman entered my Vocal Gymnasium, for the purpose \\\\n of improving his elocution as well as his health. He laboured \\\\n under dyspepsia which was attended with loss of appetite, \\\\n general debility, languor, and dejection of spirits. But in \\\\n twelve days after he commenced the exercises, there was a \\\\n radical change in his mental and physical condition : he had \\\\n become very cheerful ; and, to use his own words, his appe- \\\\n tite was ravenous. Nor is this a solitary case — numerous \\\\n others might be cited with the like happy result. \\\\n \\\\n My pupils have frequently told me that they always feel \\\\n invigorated by the exercises. A gentleman who was for- \\\\n merly a pupil of mine, and who had been in the practice of \\\\n resorting to a common gymnasium for the benefit of his \\\\n health, assured me that he derived more advantage from his \\\\n vocal, than from his athletic exercises. Let the individuals, \\\\n therefore, who visit those gymnasia, designed only for the \\\\n exercise of the limbs, not neglect the equally important \\\\n gymnastics of the pulmonary organs. \\\\n 2 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 14 (#24) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. \\\\n \\\\n As Elocution is intimately connected with the voice, and \\\\n as every reader may not be prepared to enter upon a minute \\\\n development of its various principles, the following Prelimi- \\\\n nary Observations may be of some advantage. \\\\n \\\\n Voice is sound, produced by the agitation of air when \\\\n forcibly expelled from the lungs. \\\\n \\\\n The attributes of the voice, are general and special. The \\\\n general attributes are pitch and force, and are common to \\\\n all voices. The special attributes are those peculiarities \\\\n which render one voice more agreeable, or disagreeable, \\\\n than another, as sweetness, harshness, &c. \\\\n \\\\n The acuteness and gravity of the voice depend on the \\\\n contractions and dilatations of the vocal tube. \\\\n \\\\n The degree of loudness of the voice, is in proportion to the \\\\n expulsive effort, and to the resistance which the air meets \\\\n on its passage through the glottis. \\\\n \\\\n When air is forcibly expelled from the lungs, and not suf- \\\\n ficient resistance given to its egress to produce what is gene- \\\\n rally understood by the term voice, an aspirated, or whis- \\\\n pered sound is the result. \\\\n \\\\n From voice articulated by the motions of the lips, tongue, \\\\n and other parts of the mouth, is produced oral language. \\\\n Hence oral language is not inaptly termed articulated voice. \\\\n \\\\n There are two varieties of oral language — song, and speech. \\\\n In several respects they resemble each other. Thus the \\\\n notes, both of song, and speech, vary in pitch, force, and \\\\n time. The most striking difference between them, is this : \\\\n a note of song is maintained in one range of pitch from its \\\\n commencement to its termination ; but a note of speech is \\\\n varied in pitch during its prolongation. If you prolong the \\\\n letter a, in one range of pitch, thus: \\\\n \\\\n a \\\\n \\\\n you will have an example of a note of song. If you utter it \\\\n interrogatively, and affirmatively, thus : \\\\n \\\\n a 1 d. \\\\n \\\\n you will have two varieties of the note of speech : the voice \\\\n in the interrogation, moving from a grave pitch to one more \\\\n acute ; in the affirmation, from acute to grave. \\\\n \\\\n Perhaps enough has been said by way of preliminaries. \\\\n The principles here mentioned, together with the various \\\\n others, are methodically presented, fully discussed, and dia- \\\\n gramically illustrated, in the course of the work. \\\\n \\\\n (14) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 15 (#25) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nELOCUTIOiN. \\\\n \\\\n LOCUTION is vocal delivery. \\\\n It may be said to comprise both a \\\\n science, and an art. The science \\\\n embraces the principles which con- \\\\n stitute the basis of reading and \\\\n speaking ; the art, the practical ap- \\\\n plication of these principles. \\\\n Elocution is naturally divided into two parts ; namely, \\\\n Vocal Gymnastics, and Gesture. \\\\n \\\\n Vocal Gymnastics is the philosophy of the human \\\\n voice, as well as the art of training the vocal organs \\\\n in speech and song. \\\\n \\\\n Gesture is the various postures, and motions, em- \\\\n ployed in vocal delivery. \\\\n \\\\n PART I. \\\\n VOCAL GYMNASTICS. \\\\n \\\\n OCAL GYMNASTICSisthe \\\\n \\\\n philosophy of the human voice, \\\\n as well as the art of training \\\\n the vocal organs, in speech and \\\\n song. \\\\n \\\\n Vocal Gymnastics is subdi- \\\\n vided as follows : \\\\n \\\\n 1. Articulation, 3. Force, \\\\n \\\\n 2. Pitch, 4. Time. \\\\n Articulation is the act of forming, with the organs \\\\n \\\\n of speech, the elements of vocal language. \\\\n \\\\n Pitch is the degree of the elevation of sounds. \\\\n \\\\n (15) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 16 (#26) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n16 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n Force is the degree of the loudness of sounds. \\\\n Time is the measure of sounds in regard to \\\\n duration. \\\\n \\\\n theu \\\\n \\\\n SECTION L \\\\n \\\\n ARTICULATION. \\\\n \\\\n RTICULATIONistheactof \\\\n \\\\n forming, with the organs of speech, \\\\n the elements of vocal language. \\\\n \\\\n These elements may be formed \\\\n separately, as in the utterance of \\\\n the letters of the alphabet, as \\\\n well as conjunctively, as in the \\\\n pronunciation of words. \\\\n By the utterance of the letters of the alphabet is not meant the \\\\n \\\\n pronunciation of the mere names of the letters, but the formation \\\\n \\\\n of the various sounds which the letters represent. \\\\n \\\\n A good articulation is the perfect utterance of the \\\\n elements of vocal language. \\\\n \\\\n The first step towards becoming a good elocutionist, \\\\n is a correct articulation. \" A public speaker, possessed \\\\n of only a moderate voice, if he articulates correctly, \\\\n will be better understood, and heard with greater \\\\n pleasure, than one who vociferates without judgment. \\\\n The voice of the latter may indeed extend to a conside- \\\\n rable distance, but the sound is dissipated in confusion. \\\\n Of the former voice not the smallest vibration is wast- \\\\n ed, every stroke is perceived at the utmost distance to \\\\n which it reaches ; and hence it has often the appear- \\\\n ance of penetrating even farther than one which is \\\\n loud, but badly articulated. \\\\n \\\\n \" In just articulation, the words are not to be hurried \\\\n over, nor precipitated syllable over syllable ; nor, as it \\\\n were, melted together into a mass of confusion : they \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 17 (#27) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 17 \\\\n \\\\n should not be trailed, or drawled, nor permitted to slip \\\\n out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They should \\\\n be delivered from the lips as beautiful coins newly \\\\n issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, \\\\n neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, in due \\\\n succession, and of due weight.\"* \\\\n \\\\n Without good articulation, it is impossible to be & \\\\n correct reader, or speaker. Those who have been ac \\\\n customed to pronounce their words in a careless or slo- \\\\n venly manner, will find it difficult, even with their \\\\n best efforts, to utter them distinctly. The organs of \\\\n articulation, for the want of proper exercise, become, \\\\n as it were, paralyzed. The pupil, therefore, at the \\\\n very commencement of his studies, should be conduct- \\\\n ed through a series of exercises, calculated to strengthen \\\\n the muscles of articulation, and render them obedient \\\\n to the will. The best method for effecting these pur- \\\\n poses, is to exercise the voice on the elements of speech ; \\\\n first, on each element separately ; f secondly, on va- \\\\n rious combinations. \\\\n \\\\n Under the head, Practical Elocution, will be found a variety \\\\n of Exercises on the Elements of the English language, which are \\\\n calculated to develope the voice, increase its compass, and give \\\\n flexibility to the muscles of articulation. In that part of this work \\\\n which consists of Exercises in Reading and Declamation, most \\\\n of the sounds liable to be omitted or imperfectly articulated, are re* \\\\n presented by italic letters. Hence the reader, if he pay proper \\\\n attention to the subject, will have no difficulty in correcting all \\\\n ordinary defects in his utterance. \\\\n \\\\n The value of vocal gymnastics cannot be duly appreciated by \\\\n those who have not experienced, or witnessed, their beneficial re- \\\\n eults. But, I feel confident, the time is not far distant when these \\\\n exercises will be considered, by all intelligent persons, an essential \\\\n part of primary instruction. \\\\n \\\\n * Austin\\\\\\'s Chironomia, p. 37, 38. \\\\n \\\\n f \" When the elements are pronounced singly, they may re- \\\\n ceive a concentration of the organic effort, which gives them a \\\\n clearness of sound and a definite outline, if I may so speak, at their \\\\n extremes, that make a fine preparative for a distinct and forcible \\\\n pronunciation in the compounds of speech.\" — Rush\\\\\\'s Philosophy \\\\n of the Human Voice. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 18 (#28) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n18 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER I. \\\\n \\\\n THE ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. \\\\n \\\\n The Elements of vocal language are the Sounds of \\\\n which words are composed. These sounds are repre- \\\\n sented by graphic characters, called letters. \\\\n \\\\n The number of letters in the English language, is \\\\n twenty-six ; but the number of elements is thirty-eight. \\\\n Hence, as the number of elements exceeds the number \\\\n of their literal signs, the same letter is employed, in \\\\n different situations, to represent different sounds. Thus \\\\n a represents four different sounds ; e, two ; i, two ; o, \\\\n three ; u, three ; z, two ; and there are six sounds, each \\\\n of which is represented by two letters — ou, ng, sh, wh, \\\\n ih in then, and th in thin. (See p. 19 and 20.) If we \\\\n had a perfect alphabet, every elementary sound would \\\\n be represented by its appropriate character.* \\\\n \\\\n * That men have accomplished much by furnishing the world \\\\n with literature, art, and science, will be conceded by all. Nor will \\\\n it be denied by any that there remains much to be done to carry all \\\\n human institutions to their acme of excellence. Among- the nu- \\\\n merous proofs that our institutions have not attained their highest \\\\n possible degree of perfection, is the fact that the world is now fur- \\\\n nished with as much genius for contrivance, wisdom for invention, \\\\n and judgment for application, as at any former period. He, there- \\\\n fore, who advocates the doctrine of present perfection in human \\\\n productions, suggests, at least, the possibility that that amount of \\\\n mind which is unnecessary to the successful application of the pre- \\\\n sent principles, means, and inventions to their respective purposes, \\\\n is rendered a redundancy by the want, of appropriate subjects upon \\\\n which to operate. The English language, though by no means far \\\\n advanced in years, has already been the subject of much concur- \\\\n rent, and individual action ; yet there is hardly one part of it which \\\\n is not marred with defect, or deficiency. Even the English alpha- \\\\n bet suffers from both these imperfections. To attain perfection in \\\\n any thing, is, perhaps, beyond the power of man, especially in the \\\\n medium of communicating his ideas. But although perfection in lan- \\\\n guage can hardly be expected, yet, there is a degree of excellence \\\\n which is not so difficult of attainment as to render all exertion una- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 19 (#29) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 19 \\\\n \\\\n The elements, as well as the letters by which they \\\\n are represented, are usually divided into two classes. \\\\n Vowels and Consonants. A more philosophical divi- \\\\n sion, however, is into three classes, Vowels, Subvowels, \\\\n and Aspirates. \\\\n \\\\n The vowels are pure vocal sounds ; their number is \\\\n fifteen. \\\\n \\\\n The subvowels have a vocality, but inferior to that \\\\n of the vowels ; their number is fourteen. \\\\n \\\\n The aspirates are made with the whispering breath, \\\\n and, consequently, have no vocality ; they are nine in \\\\n number. \\\\n \\\\n Classification of the Elements, \\\\n \\\\n VOWELS.

There is, then, a deficiency in our alphabet \\\\n of twelve letters — and he who shall supply this imperfection, will \\\\n be one of the greatest benefactors of the human race. This work \\\\n must be done before our orthography can be rendered consistent, \\\\n our pronunciation natural and uniform, and our language easy of \\\\n acquisition. Until this is accomplished, words must be spelled one \\\\n way, and pronounced another — indeed, two languages must be \\\\n learned, instead of one. Should the English language, as some \\\\n confidently expect, become the language of the world, the advan- \\\\n tages in which a complete alphabet would result, can be conceived \\\\n by those only who have duly reflected upon the subject. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 20 (#30) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n20 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n ITUBVOWELS.

SHI \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER II. \\\\n \\\\n THE VOWELS. \\\\n \\\\n The vowels are divided into Monothongs, Diph \\\\n thongs, and Triphthongs. \\\\n \\\\n The Monothongs consist of one kind of sound through- \\\\n out their concrete movement, and consequently are \\\\n simple elements ; they are represented by the italics in \\\\n the following words : \\\\n \\\\n arm, all, an, eve, end, in, on, up, full. \\\\n \\\\n The Diphthongs consist of two vowel sounds, which \\\\n coalesce so intimately that they appear like one uni- \\\\n form sound ; they are represented by the italics in the \\\\n following words : \\\\n \\\\n ale, He, lose, tube. \\\\n \\\\n The diphthong a, as well as 1, has a characteristic \\\\n sound for its radical, and the monothong, f, for its van- \\\\n ish. These diphthongs, under certain circumstances \\\\n (for instance, when they are carried through a wide \\\\n range of pitch, as in interrogation with surprise), are \\\\n converted into triphthongs, the third constituent being \\\\n the monothong, e. \\\\n \\\\n The diphthong 6, as well as u, has a characteristic \\\\n sound for its radical, and the subvowel to, for its vanish. \\\\n \\\\n The Triphthongs consist of three vowel sounds which \\\\n coalesce so intimately that they appear like one uni- \\\\n form sound ; they are represented by the italics, in the \\\\n following words : \\\\n \\\\n old, our. \\\\n \\\\n The first constituent of 6, as well as that of ou, is a \\\\n sound characteristic of this element ; and the diph- \\\\n thong 6 constitutes the second and the third constitu \\\\n ent of these triphthongs. \\\\n \\\\n The following scheme is an analysis of the diph- \\\\n thongs and triphthongs.

R should be trilled when it \\\\n precedes a vowel, as in roll, crush, &c, ; but when it \\\\n follows a vowel, as in air, orb, &c, it should be made \\\\n smooth. \\\\n \\\\n I have met with a number of individuals who could not trill the \\\\n R, and others who did it with difficulty.

When they are followed by a vowel, their second consti- \\\\n tuent is formed by aspirating that vowel. This may be rendered \\\\n obvious by pronouncing forcibly, and deliberately, the words, Bay, \\\\n Day, Gay, and Kay, Pay, Tay, or any other words, in which B, D, \\\\n G, and K, P, T are followed by vowels. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 27 (#37) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 27 \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER V. \\\\n \\\\n THE POSTURES OF THE MOUTH. \\\\n \\\\n An accurate knowledge of the positions which the \\\\n organs of articulation should assume in the formation \\\\n of the several elements of vocal language, is very im- \\\\n portant to those who would speak with ease and ele- \\\\n gance. To aid the reader still further in the acquisi- \\\\n tion of this knowledge, he is furnished with the various \\\\n postm^es of the mouth, required in uttering the elements \\\\n energetically, and singly. \\\\n \\\\n The elements are grouped according to the posture \\\\n in which the mouth should be when they are formed. \\\\n It will be seen that the Diphthongs and Triphthongs \\\\n have each two postures of the mouth — one at the \\\\n commencement, the other at the termination of the sound. \\\\n \\\\n These postures are, of course, more or less modified, \\\\n when the elements are uttered in their various combi- \\\\n nations, and with different degrees of force. \\\\n \\\\n The pupil should exercise his organs of speech, in the \\\\n most forcible manner, three times a week, and, if pos- \\\\n sible, even every day, on all the elements. The vow- \\\\n els should be exploded from the throat, both interroga- \\\\n tively and affirmatively, in every range of pitch within \\\\n the compass of the voice, and with every possible de- \\\\n gree of force. \\\\n \\\\n The vowels are exploded in the following manner : \\\\n make a full inspiration, close the glottis, and contract \\\\n the muscles of expiration so as to condense the air in \\\\n the lungs, then utter the element with a sudden and \\\\n forcible emission of the breath. The sounds thus pro- \\\\n duced may be denominated vocal thunder; the effect \\\\n upon an audience is electrical. \\\\n \\\\n This exercise strengthens the vocal organs, and ena- \\\\n bles the speaker to be heard at a great distance, with \\\\n very little effort, or expenditure of breath. It is also \\\\n beneficial to health. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 28 (#38) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n28 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 29 (#39) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. \\\\n \\\\n 29 \\\\n \\\\n how \\\\n m ind \\\\n 2?it \\\\n \\\\n ale \\\\n \\\\n ale \\\\n \\\\n old \\\\n our \\\\n \\\\n lose \\\\n \\\\n twbe \\\\n \\\\n J \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 30 (#40) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n30 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER VI. \\\\n \\\\n DEFECTIVE ARTICULATION. \\\\n \\\\n Articulation is defective when one o~ more ele» \\\\n ments of a word are omitted, or imperfectly formed ; or \\\\n when one element is substituted for another. \\\\n \\\\n Defective articulation is exceedingly common : per- \\\\n haps there is not one individual in ten thousand whose \\\\n articulation is perfect. This arises from the neglect of \\\\n a proper gymnastic training of the organs of speech in \\\\n childhood. As soon as children are capable of imitating \\\\n sounds, they should be taught the elements of vocal \\\\n language ; and, to facilitate their acquisition of this \\\\n knowledge, they should be made to exercise before a \\\\n mirror, so as to compare the movements of their own \\\\n lips with those of the lips of their instructor. By pur- \\\\n suing this course, a good foundation will be laid for a \\\\n perfect and graceful articulation. \\\\n \\\\n In that part of this work which consists of Exercises \\\\n in Reading and Declamation, all, or nearly all, the \\\\n letters representing sounds liable to be omitted, or im- \\\\n perfectly articulated, are italicised. Hence it. is not \\\\n necessary to furnish examples, and treat of the subject \\\\n minutely, in this place. There are, however, some in- \\\\n stances of defective articulation, which are not pointed \\\\n out by the italic letters — these are so important that \\\\n they deserve special notice. I allude to those cases in \\\\n which one element is substituted for another. The \\\\n remainder of this chapter will be devoted to their con- \\\\n sideration. \\\\n \\\\n Children are apt to substitute the sound of d for that \\\\n of g in gay ; and the sound of t for that of k, or c in \\\\n cat. Thus, for gay, they say day ; for cake, tate, &c. \\\\n \\\\n To enable the pupil to correct these faults, I explain \\\\n to him the manner in which the sounds of g and k are \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 31 \\\\n \\\\n produced — they are formed by pressing the root of \\\\n the tongue against the soft palate, and not, like d and \\\\n t by pressing its tip against the gums of the upper \\\\n incisors. I then direct him to pronounce, after me, the \\\\n elements, d, g, and t, k, and the syllables da, ga, and \\\\n ta, ka, thus : \\\\n \\\\n d, g; d,g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g. \\\\n \\\\n da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; de, ge ; de, ge ; &e. \\\\n ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; te, ke ; te, ke ; &c. \\\\n \\\\n The object of this exercise is to contrast the substituted \\\\n sound with the correct one. \\\\n \\\\n When this plan does not prove successful, I open my \\\\n mouth as widely as possible, so that the tip of the \\\\n tongue cannot touch the gums of the upper teeth, and \\\\n request the pupil to open his in like manner. I then \\\\n direct him to pronounce, after me, the following sylla- \\\\n bles: \\\\n \\\\n ga, ga, ga, ga ; ge, ge ; gl, gl ; go, gd, gb ; gu, gu, gu ; gou. \\\\n ka, ka, ka, ka ; ke, ke ; kl, kl ; ko, k6, k& ; ku, ku, ku ; kou. \\\\n ag, eg, Ig, 6g, ug, oug; ak, ek, Ik, 6k, ftk, ouk. \\\\n \\\\n When neither of these schemes proves successful, I \\\\n request the pupil to press his tongue downwards, and \\\\n backwards, with his index finger, while I do the same, \\\\n and pronounce, after me, the syllables in the preceding \\\\n exercise. This I have never known to fail. \\\\n \\\\n Some children omit the element z, when it follows d, \\\\n and the element sh when it follows t ; for instance, they \\\\n pronounce John, don, and Charles, tarles, &c. # My \\\\n method of correcting these defects is to contrast the \\\\n false pronunciation with the true one, as in the follow- \\\\n ing exercise : \\\\n \\\\n dia, d2a; da, dSa; da, d2a; da, dJa; de, die; &c. \\\\n \\\\n ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; te, tshe ; &c. \\\\n \\\\n * J is a compound of d and z in azure ; and ch is equivalent to \\\\n Uh. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n32 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n The v and w are confounded by some perons ; for \\\\n instance, when they would say vine, they say wine, and \\\\n vice versa. An attention to the proper postures of the \\\\n mouth, in the production of these elements will soon \\\\n enable the pupil to correct this fault.* (See pos- \\\\n tures of the mouth, page 28.) The following exercise, \\\\n founded on the principle of contrast, should be fre- \\\\n quently practised by the pupil, in the most energetic \\\\n manner. \\\\n \\\\n va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; ve, we ; ve, we ; &c. \\\\n \\\\n wa, va; wa, va; wa, va; wa, va ; we, ve ; we, ve ; &c. \\\\n \\\\n In correcting faults in articulation, I often find it \\\\n advantageous to exercise the pupil before a mirror, that \\\\n he may observe the contrast between the movements \\\\n of his own mouth, and those of mine. \\\\n \\\\n LISPING. \\\\n \\\\n Lisping is the substitution of the sound of th for that \\\\n of some other letter, generally for that of s in sin. \\\\n Thus the words, sale, send, sight, song, &c, are pro- \\\\n nounced thale, thend, thight, thong, &c. \\\\n \\\\n The lisper should be told, that, in forming the sound \\\\n of th, the tip of the tongue is pressed gently against \\\\n the inner surface of the upper incisor teeth ; whereas, \\\\n in forming that of s, it is placed, in like manner, against \\\\n the gums of the upper incisor teeth. Hence, to avoid \\\\n making th for s, the tongue should be drawn back a \\\\n little, and its point turned upward against the gums of \\\\n the upper teeth. In the correction of lisping, the fol- \\\\n owing exercise may be practised with advantage : \\\\n \\\\n tha, sa ; tM, sa ; tha, sa ; tha, sa ; the, se ; the, the ; &c. \\\\n \\\\n * A young; gentleman recently entered my institution who had \\\\n many faults in his utterance. Among- others was the sing-ular one \\\\n of pronouncing; vw for v: for vine, he said vwine; for vale, vwaJe, \\\\n &c. This, as well as the other numerous faults with wn.ich his \\\\n pronunciation was marred, arose from the want of proper instruc- \\\\n tion upon the use of the organs of speech. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 33 (#43) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 33 \\\\n \\\\n The defects of articulation, in which one element \\\\n (S substituted for another, are numerous ; but, as the \\\\n method of treatment is similar in all, it is presumed \\\\n enough has been said to enable the teacher to manage \\\\n them successfully, particularly as appropriate exer- \\\\n cises, for most of them, will be found in the practical \\\\n part of this work. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER VII. \\\\n \\\\n STAMMERING. \\\\n \\\\n Stammering is a functional derangement of the or- \\\\n gans of speech, which renders them incapable, under \\\\n certain circumstances, of promptly obeying the com- \\\\n mands of the will. \\\\n \\\\n In a majority of cases, the cause of this affection \\\\n operates through the medium of the mind. \\\\n \\\\n Stammering is cured by a regular course of hygienic \\\\n elocution. But, as the disease exists under a variety \\\\n of forms, it requires a variety of treatment. And, as \\\\n the treatment is medico-elocutional, he who would \\\\n apply it successfully, must unite the skill of the elocu- \\\\n tionist with that of the physician. The idea that non- \\\\n medical men are capable of discharging the duties of \\\\n applying the remedies to complicated complaints of \\\\n the human body, is a sui generis in logic, and a bane \\\\n in the practice of the healing art. \\\\n \\\\n As a full consideration of the subject of stammering \\\\n is not compatible with the design of this work ; and, as \\\\n I am preparing for publication another which will \\\\n treat exclusively of impediments of speech, I shall con- \\\\n clude the present chapter with the following \\\\n \\\\n Remarks on Stammering , from a Lecture on Elocution \\\\n delivered before the American Lyceum, May 6, 1837, \\\\n by Andrew Comstock, M.D. \\\\n \\\\n For the last ten years the author of these remarks has \\\\n been engaged in an investigation of the philosophy of the \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 34 (#44) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n34 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n human voice, with a view to the formation of a system of \\\\n just Elocution, and to the discovery of the true means for \\\\n removing impediments of speech in stammerers. How far \\\\n he has succeeded in his attempt, is not for him to say. His \\\\n system is the result of his own reflection and experience ; \\\\n and, as it is founded in philosophy, it is the only true system. \\\\n The following pages contain the mere outlines of the system. \\\\n The work itself will be presented to the public as soon as \\\\n the author\\\\\\'s other labours will permit. \\\\n \\\\n Stammering or stuttering is a hesitation or interruption of speech, \\\\n and is usually attended with more or less distortion of feature. \\\\n This affection presents itself under a variety of forms ; but my limits \\\\n will not allow me to give a particular description of them. I will \\\\n notice only the most striking. \\\\n \\\\n In some cases, the stammerer makes an effort to speak, and all \\\\n his breath is expelled without producing vocality ; in others, the \\\\n lips are spasmodically closed : — these two forms often occur in the \\\\n game case. Sometimes the stammerer, while speaking or reading, \\\\n loses all power over the vocal organs, and remains some momenta \\\\n with his mouth open, before he can recover sufficient energy to \\\\n proceed. In many cases, the stammerer repeats the word imme- \\\\n diately preceding the one he is attempting to pronounce, or he re- \\\\n peats, in a rapid manner, the first element, or the first syllable, of \\\\n the difficult word. \\\\n \\\\n Causes. — The predisposing causes are nervous irritability and \\\\n delicacy of constitution. \\\\n \\\\n The most usual exciting causes are diffidence, embarrassment, a \\\\n fear of not being successful when about to make an effort to speak, \\\\n an attempt to speak faster than the vocal organs can assume the \\\\n proper positions for utterance. Two or more of these causes often \\\\n occur in the same case. Sometimes the habit of stammering is \\\\n acquired by imitation. \\\\n \\\\n The proximate cause of stammering is a spasmodic action of the \\\\n muscles of speech. \\\\n \\\\n Prognosis. — The probability of a cure depends upon the follow- \\\\n ing circumstances: If the stammerer has a cheerful disposition, is \\\\n distinguished for energy of mind and decision of character, can ap- \\\\n preciate the variations of pitch in speech and song, or, in other \\\\n words, has an ear for music and a taste for elocution, the prognosis \\\\n is favourable. But if he is of a nervous temperament, subject to \\\\n melancholy, irresolute of purpose, incapable of imitation in speaking \\\\n and singing, the prognosis is unfavourable. \\\\n \\\\n Treatment. — The stammerer should be impressed with the \\\\n importance, nay, necessity, of giving exclusive attention to the sub- \\\\n ject ; and he should not be allowed to converse with any one till \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 35 (#45) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 3o \\\\n \\\\n he can speak without stammering 1 . These rules cannot be too \\\\n strongly enforced. I am fully persuaded of this from my own ex- \\\\n perience. Several stammerers, who have placed themselves under \\\\n my care, taking but two or three lessons a week, and attending to \\\\n their usual avocations, have left me disappointed ; while those who \\\\n have given undivided attention to the subject, have been entirely \\\\n relieved. True, many are more or less benefited even by occasion \\\\n ally taking a lesson ; but it is very difficult, by any irregular course, \\\\n to effect a radical cure. The habit of stammering should be ar- \\\\n rested at once ; for, while it is continued, how is it possible that the \\\\n habit of speaking correctly can be established 1 \\\\n \\\\n Great pains should be taken to inspire the stammerer with confi- \\\\n dence. He should be convinced that his success depends mainly \\\\n upon his own exertions : that he must pursue the various exercises \\\\n assigned him with indefatigable zeal, with untiring industry; that \\\\n he has the same organs of speech as other people, and nothing is \\\\n necessary to enable him to use them as well, but a conviction in his \\\\n ability to do so. To think that one can do, gives almost the ability \\\\n to accomplish — but to think that one cannot do, virtually takes \\\\n away the ability to do, even where it is ample. \\\\n \\\\n Stammering is often continued by the subordinate estimation \\\\n which the stammerer puts upon himself. He is too apt to consider \\\\n those around him giants, and himself a dwarf. As this estimation \\\\n of himself serves to perpetuate his disease, it is clear that its reme- \\\\n dy must be found in making himself equal to any: if this mental \\\\n classification into giants and dwarfs must take place, let the stam- \\\\n merers make themselves the giants, and those around them the \\\\n dwarfs. \\\\n \\\\n The teacher should study the disposition of his pupil : he should \\\\n persuade him to banish from his mind all melancholy thoughts — \\\\n in short, he should do every thing in his power to render his pupil \\\\n cheerful and happy. \\\\n \\\\n Various athletic exercises should be resorted to daily, to invigo- \\\\n rate all the muscles of voluntary motion, and diminish nervous irri- \\\\n tability. In some cases it may be necessary to have recourse to \\\\n tonics, anti-spasmodics, bathing in salt water, frictions over the \\\\n whole surface of the body, &c, &c. Electricity may be used with \\\\n advantage as a tonic, and also as a means of interrupting the spasm \\\\n of the vocal organs. \\\\n \\\\n The vocal treatment is deduced from the following circum \\\\n stances : \\\\n \\\\n 1. An ability to sing. \\\\n \\\\n 2. An ability to speak when alone : \\\\n \\\\n 3. And if the stammerer must speak before an audience, the \\\\n smaller the audience and the farther he is removed from it, the \\\\n better. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n36 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n 4. An ability to speak amidst a noise that is sufficient to render \\\\n the human voice nearly or quite inaudible. \\\\n \\\\n 5. An ability to speak better in the dark than in the light. \\\\n b\\\\\\\\ An ability to speak in a measured manner. \\\\n \\\\n 7. An ability to speak in a drawling manner. \\\\n \\\\n 8. An ability to speak with the mouth more or less distorted. \\\\n \\\\n 9. An ability to speak in any key, either higher or lower than \\\\n that in which the stammerer usually converses. \\\\n \\\\n 10. An ability to speak with a halloo. \\\\n \\\\n 11. An ability to speak when the attention is divided or arrested \\\\n by some object or circumstance more or less irrelevant to the sub- \\\\n ject. \\\\n \\\\n 12. An ability to speak in concert or simultaneously. Every one \\\\n who has learned to sing, knows how much easier it is to sing in \\\\n concert than alone. All the exercises, therefore, for the cure of \\\\n stammering, should, at first, be conducted in concert. \\\\n \\\\n Stammering may be considered a fault in elocution, the result of \\\\n defective education, and is confirmed by habit. If children were \\\\n properly instructed in .speaking and reading, this affection of the \\\\n vocal organs would probably, seldom or never occur. Hence, no \\\\n mode of treatment that is not founded in just elocution or the cor- \\\\n rect exercise of the organs of speech for the purposes of vocal ex- \\\\n pression, can be relied on. This must appear obvious to every in- \\\\n telligent and reflecting mind. The stammerer must be taught how \\\\n to give language the pitch, time, and force which the sense requires. \\\\n To effect this, his muscles of speech, which have long been refrac- \\\\n tory, must be trained till they are brought under the control of \\\\n volition, and like a well-marshalled troop of soldiers, made to act in \\\\n harmonious concert. \\\\n \\\\n Oral language may be resolved into certain sounds which are its \\\\n elements. Now there are certain positions of the organs of speech \\\\n more favourable than others for the production of the elements. \\\\n The stammerer should be made thoroughly acquainted with these \\\\n positions, and, in connexion with them, should be required to exer- \\\\n cise his voice in the most energetic manner upon all the elements \\\\n singly, till he can utter them without hesitation. He should also \\\\n utter them in various combinations, not only according to the laws \\\\n of syllabication, but in every irregular way. The vowels should \\\\n be exploded from the throat with great force ; and they should be \\\\n sung, as well as pronounced with the rising and falling inflection, \\\\n through every interval of pitch within the compass of the voice. \\\\n \\\\n The pupil should be drilled in various exercises whose highest \\\\n peculiarity is time and force. Time may be measured by means \\\\n of the Metronome, by beating with the hand, and by marching.* \\\\n \\\\n Also by beating with the dumb-bells. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nARTICULATION. 37 \\\\n \\\\n Pitch, time, and force, are the elements of expression, and a propel \\\\n combination of them in reading and speaking, constitutes good elo- \\\\n cution. When, therefore, the stammerer becomes master of these \\\\n elements, as well as the elements of the language, he may com- \\\\n mence speaking and reading. In his first attempts at conversation, \\\\n Doth teacher and pupil should speak in a deliberate manner, with a \\\\n full, firm tone of voice, and in a very low pitch. \\\\n \\\\n The stammerer should now commit to memory a short piece \\\\n which requires to be spoken with explosive force; for example, \\\\n \" Satan\\\\\\'s speech to his legions.\" The members of the class should \\\\n stand at a sufficient distance from each other to prevent their hands \\\\n coming in contact when their arms are extended. They should \\\\n then pronounce the speech in concert, after the teacher, and accom- \\\\n pany it with appropriate gesticulation. It should be repeated again \\\\n and again, till each pupil can give it proper expression, both as \\\\n regards voice and gesture. Each pupil should then, in turn, take \\\\n the place of the teacher and give out the speech to the class. To \\\\n prevent the pupil\\\\\\'s stammering, while he is performing the teach- \\\\n er\\\\\\'s part, the teacher himself should play an accompaniment on the \\\\n violoncello, violin, organ, drum, or some other instrument. At firsl \\\\n the notes should be made very loud ; but if the effort of the pupil, \\\\n standing out of the class, is likely to be successful, they should gra- \\\\n dually be made softer and softer, and, finally, the accompaniment \\\\n omitted altogether. This piece should be pronounced alternately \\\\n with one which requires to be spoken with long quantity and in a \\\\n low pitch, as \" Ossian\\\\\\'s Address to the Sun.\" \\\\n \\\\n When the pupil has mastered these two kinds of reading, he may \\\\n take up dignified dialogue, and, lastly, conversational pieces. He \\\\n should drawl out difficult words, which are generally those having \\\\n short vowels preceded by labials, dentals, and gutturals. \\\\n \\\\n In very bad cases of stammering, the pupil should first sing the \\\\n words, then drawl them, then pronounce them with very long quan- \\\\n tity, and thus gradually approximate to common speaking. \\\\n \\\\n As soon as the pupils can speak without stammering, they should \\\\n recite singly in a very large room, or in the open air, at a distance \\\\n from the audience, which, at first, should consist of the members of \\\\n the class only. A few visiters should be occasionally introduced, \\\\n and the number should be gradually increased. In this way the \\\\n stammerer will soon acquire sufficient confidence to speak before a \\\\n large assembly. In some cases it may be expedient for the stam- \\\\n merer to recite before an audience in a dark room ; but as he ac- \\\\n quires confidence, light should be gradually admitted. \\\\n \\\\n Stammerers, instead of speaking immediately after inspiration, as \\\\n they should do, often attempt to speak immediately after expiration, \\\\n when, of course, they have no power to speak. The lungs, like a \\\\n bellows, perform their part in the process of speaking, best, when \\\\n plentifully supplied with air. This is an important fact, and should \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 38 (#48) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n38 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n be remembered, not only by stammerers, but also by those who nave \\\\n occasion to read or speak in public. Loud speaking - , long-continued, \\\\n with the lungs but partially distended, is very injurious to these \\\\n organs : it is apt to occasion a spitting of blood, v Men is not unfre- \\\\n quently a precursor of pulmonary consumption. But loud speaking, \\\\n with proper management of the breath, is a healthful exercise : be- \\\\n sides strengthening the muscles which it calls into action, it pro \\\\n motes the clecarbonization of the blood, and, consequently, exerts a \\\\n salutary influence on the system generally. [See additional re- \\\\n marks, in Appendix at the end of the volume, where will be found \\\\n an account of the new surgical operation for the radical cure of \\\\n stammering, which has been performed, with more or less success, \\\\n both in Europe and in this country.] \\\\n \\\\n SECTION II. \\\\n \\\\n PITCH. \\\\n \\\\n ITCH is the degree of the eleva- \\\\n tion of sounds. \\\\n \\\\n As pitch regards the elevation of sounds, \\\\n it respects their acuteness and gravity. I \\\\n /5 $f use the term pitch in its widest significa- \\\\n tion. — In the science of music, it is used \\\\n not only in the sense in which I employ it, \\\\n but it also has a special application : in the \\\\n latter, it is applied to the medium note, the regulating note to \\\\n which instruments are brought by the act of tuning. When ap- \\\\n plied in this sense, it is termed concert-pitch. The note which has \\\\n been adopted, by common consent, as the pitch-note, is A, the open \\\\n note of the second string of the violin : it is written in the second \\\\n space of the treble staff. \\\\n \\\\n A lax division of pitch is into high and low ; in other \\\\n words, into acute and grave ; (those notes being called \\\\n high, or acute, which are above the natural pitch of \\\\n the voice ; and those low, or grave, which are below it) \\\\n Strictly speaking, the application of high and low, to pitch, is \\\\n without philosophic foundation : it has originated, not from any \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 39 (#49) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. 39 \\\\n \\\\n principles in the acuteness and gravity of sound, but from the rela- \\\\n tive position of the notes in the graphic scale. This is obvious \\\\n from the fact that the degrees of the scale may be exemplified in a \\\\n horizontal line, by varying the forms of the graphic notes, as was \\\\n done by the Greeks. \\\\n \\\\n An exact division of pitch, as demonstrated by the \\\\n diatonic scale, is into tones and semitones.* \\\\n \\\\n The word tone, as here employed, signifies a certain degree of \\\\n difference in pitch between two notes, as that between the first and \\\\n second note of the scale. But in some cases we use the word tone, \\\\n as synonymous with note; for instance, in some persons the tones \\\\n oi the voice are more musical than in others — that is, the notes \\\\n of the voice. \\\\n \\\\n The diatonic scale consists of seven sounds, moving \\\\n discretely from grave to acute, or from acute to grave, \\\\n by different degrees of pitch, of which the semitone \\\\n may be the common measure, or divisor, without a \\\\n fraction. The scale, however, is not complete without \\\\n the octave, which is a repetition of the first note in the \\\\n eighth degree. \\\\n \\\\n The notes do not ascend by equal degrees of pitch, \\\\n but by tones and semitones ; the semitones occurring \\\\n between the third and fourth, and seventh and eighth. \\\\n The order of the scale, therefore, is as follows : two \\\\n tones and a semitone, three tones and a semitone. And \\\\n should it be desirable to extend the series of sounds, the \\\\n eighth note of the first octave will become the first note \\\\n of the second octave ; the eighth note of the second oc- \\\\n tave, the first note of the third, and so on. \\\\n \\\\n In teaching the pupil to \" raise and fall the eight \\\\n notes,\" as it is called, the monosyllables, Do, Re, Mi, \\\\n Fa, Sol, La, Si,f may be employed. \\\\n \\\\n Diag. 4 is a graphic representation of the scale.

This \\\\n point, in a majority of persons, is \\\\n about two octaves above the lowest \\\\n note of the voice. The natural voice \\\\n embraces all the notes below this \\\\n point ; the falsetto, all the notes above \\\\n it. (See Diag. 5.) \\\\n \\\\n The Italians call the natural voice voce di \\\\n petto, and the falsetto voice voce di testa ; f \\\\n because they suppose the former to come \\\\n from the chest, and the latter from the head. \\\\n This error has arisen from a want of anato- \\\\n mical and physiological knowledge of the \\\\n vocal organs. Voice is never formed in the \\\\n chest, or in the head : it is always formed in \\\\n the upper part of the larynx, at the aperture \\\\n of the glottis. It is, however, formed higher, \\\\n or lower in the throat, according to its de- \\\\n gree of acuteness, or gravity. At the command of the wi \\\\n larynx may be elevated, or depressed, and the aperture of the glot- \\\\n tis enlarged, or diminished. The larynx is the most depressed, and \\\\n the aperture of the glottis the most dilated, when the gravest sound \\\\n is formed ; and the larynx is the most elevated, and the aperture \\\\n \\\\n the \\\\n \\\\n * It is said that the ear is capable of perceiving nine octaves, \\\\n f Voce di petto (Ital.), voice from the breast.

From this circumstance, no \\\\n doubt, has arisen the error of calling the natural voice voce di petto, \\\\n and the falsetto voice voce di testa. \\\\n \\\\n The whispering voice does not, like the natural voice \\\\n and the falsetto, owe its peculiarity to pitch, but to the \\\\n absence of what is generally understood by the term \\\\n vocality. The compass of the whispering voice is about \\\\n an octave. My own extends through ten degrees of \\\\n the scale.* \\\\n \\\\n The natural pitch of the female voice is an octave \\\\n above that of the male voice. The pitch of the female \\\\n voice corresponds to that of the violin ; the pitch of the \\\\n male voice, to that of the violoncello. The voices of \\\\n boys are of the same pitch as the female voice — one \\\\n octave above a man\\\\\\'s voice. When boys are about the \\\\n age of fourteen, their voices undergo a change of pitch. \\\\n \\\\n The notes of the falsetto voice are called treble ; the \\\\n upper notes of the natural voice, tenor ; and the lower \\\\n notes of the natural voice, bass.-f (See Diag. 5.) \\\\n \\\\n The divisions of the voice, as given by Italian au- \\\\n thors, and adopted by many musicians of other coun- \\\\n tries, are as follows : \\\\n \\\\n \" There are three departments in the human voice, \\\\n viz., the high, the middle, and the low. These depart- \\\\n ments are in the female, as well as in the male voice. \\\\n Soprano, mezzo soprano, and contralto, are female voices. \\\\n Tenore, baritono, and basso, are male voices. \"J \\\\n \\\\n The reader will observe that the falsetto voice is not \\\\n included in the above division. \\\\n \\\\n To a bass, a baritone, and a contralto voice, natu- \\\\n \\\\n * Notes analogous to those of the whispering voice may be made \\\\n on the German flute, and some other wind instruments, through the \\\\n compass of an octave. \\\\n \\\\n f When I speak of the voice, I speak of the adult male voice, \\\\n unless otherwise stated. \\\\n \\\\n I Introduction to the Art and Science of Music, by Phil.

It ia \\\\n formed by dividing the whole tones of the diatonic scale into semi- \\\\n tones, by five additional sounds. The chromatic scale may be il- \\\\n lustrated by touching all the white and black keys of a piano-forte, \\\\n in their consecutive order. (The chromatic scale is represented by \\\\n No. 4, in Diag. 9.) \\\\n \\\\n The sounds which compose the diatonic scale, as I have said, are \\\\n named after the first seven letters of the alphabet. The five addi- \\\\n tional sounds, which, when added to the diatonic scale, divide it \\\\n into semitones, are called flats, or sharps, according as they receive \\\\n the names of the notes immediately below, or of those immediately \\\\n above them. Thus, the second note of the chromatic scale of C, is \\\\n called C sharp, or Dflat; the fourth is called D sharp, or Eflat; \\\\n the seventh, F sharp, or G flat ; the ninth, G sharp, or Aflat; \\\\n and the eleventh, A sharp, or Bflat.

Sharps and flats \\\\n are generally placed at the beginning of a tune, or strain, immedi- \\\\n ately after the cleff. They are then called the signature ; because \\\\n they serve to point out the key. \\\\n \\\\n By key is meant a scale of sounds, to the first of which all the \\\\n others bear a certain relation. This first note is called the key- \\\\n note, .\\\\\\' fundamental note, or tonic. As each note of the diatonic \\\\n scat; ( \\\\\\' C (see No. 1), as well as its sharp and flat (see No. 4), \\\\n may <.y-, assumed as a key-note of a series of seven, it follows that \\\\n there are twenty-one major, and twenty-one minor keys. And as \\\\n eaci» note of the diatonic scale of C, as well as its sharp and flat, \\\\n may also be assumed as a key-note of a chromatic series, it follows \\\\n thai there are twenty-one keys in the chromatic genus. These, \\\\n ••added to the forty-two keys in the diatonic genus, make the whole \\\\n number of keys in the musical system amount to sixty-three. Still, \\\\n as there are but twelve notes, there can be but thirty-six scales ; \\\\n and even this number may be resolved into three — one major, one \\\\n minor, and one chromatic; all the others are transpositions of the \\\\n three primitive scales into different ranges of pitch. \\\\n \\\\n The speaking voice, in good elocution, seldom rises \\\\n higher than a fifth above the lowest note of its com- \\\\n pass. Supposing the lowest note which can be made \\\\n with a full intonation, to be F, the following scheme \\\\n will show the relative pitch of keys, adapted to the \\\\n expression of different kinds of sentiments. \\\\n \\\\n KEYS OF THE SPEAKING VOICE.

Acuto-grave circumflex ( A ). \\\\n \\\\n Falling inflection ( l ). Gravo-acute circumflex (v). \\\\n Acuto-gravo-acute circumflex (/v). \\\\n Gravo-acuto-grave circumflex (v\\\\\\\\). \\\\n \\\\n In reading and speaking, each syllable has some one \\\\n of these inflections ; but, for practical purposes, it is \\\\n necessary to mark those only which are emphatic. \\\\n \\\\n The various movements of the voice, in song and speech, may be \\\\n explained in the following manner : \\\\n \\\\n When the bow is drawn across an open string of the violin, or \\\\n any of its species, a sound is produced of a uniform pitch, from be- \\\\n ginning to end. This sound is a pure note of music, and, so far as \\\\n pitch is concerned, is identical with a note of song. When the \\\\n bow is drawn across the same string, while the centre of the string \\\\n is pressed down with the finger, a sound is produced similar to that \\\\n of the open string, but an octave higher. The intermediate notes \\\\n of the diatonic scale may be produced by pressing down the string, \\\\n at the proper places, and drawing the bow across it. \\\\n \\\\n When a string of the violin is pressed down by the finger, and, \\\\n at the same time, the finger is made to slide upon it towards the \\\\n bridge of the instrument, during the drawing of the bow, a sound is \\\\n produced which gradually increases in acuteness from beginning \\\\n to end. When the finger is made to slide in the opposite direction, \\\\n during the drawing of the bow, a sound is produced which gradu- \\\\n ally increases in gravity during its prolongation. When the finger \\\\n is made to slide towards the bridge, and thence back again, during \\\\n the drawing of the bow, a simple circumflex note is produced. \\\\n When the finger is made to slide towards the bridge, thence back \\\\n again, and thence again towards the bridge, during the drawing of \\\\n the bow, a compound circumflex note is produced. \\\\n \\\\n Other varieties of the slide might be given, but these are suffi- \\\\n cient to answer the purpose of explanation. \\\\n \\\\n \"The slide is a grace of much simplicity and beauty, evidently \\\\n drawn from nature. It expresses the most tender and affectionate \\\\n emotions: we hear it in those little gusts of passion which mothers \\\\n use in caressing their infants: it is one of the most endearing tones \\\\n in the language of nature. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 49 (#59) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. 49 \\\\n \\\\n \" The portamento, or carriage of the voice, as the Italians term \\\\n it, is an easy mode of sliding from one tone to another. Hence \\\\n second-rate singers find it a convenient method of encountering \\\\n those notes which lie at remote and awkward distances. In some \\\\n voices it is so fixed, by habit, that two bars cannot be sung without \\\\n it. When so used, it utterly destroys every pretence to good sing- \\\\n ing, by interposing an effect of the most sickening kind ; when used \\\\n with discretion, it adds much to the force of expression ; and, in \\\\n Madame Caradori, it was a grace both tender and agreeable. \\\\n \\\\n \" The violinist, Paganini, the present wonder of the world, plays \\\\n an entire cantabile* upon one string, sliding through all the inter- \\\\n vals with a single finger — the effect of which is so plaintive, and \\\\n desolate, as to move his audience to tears. Velluti, the first singing- \\\\n master of the age, uses this grace with incomparable beauty; in his \\\\n voice it imparts a tenderness not to be described.\"! \\\\n \\\\n The sliding notes above described are analagous to drawling \\\\n notes of speech. Speech, to be natural, requires each syllable to \\\\n be uttered with a certain degree of force. This force is always in \\\\n proportion to the length of the syllable. A syllable is drawled \\\\n when it is pronounced with inadequate force — in other words, with \\\\n force less than that which constitutes the minimum degree of natu- \\\\n ral speech. \\\\n \\\\n The extent of the concrete intervals of the notes of \\\\n speech, is various under various circumstances. A \\\\n rising inflection may be carried through the whole \\\\n compass of the voice. But, in the most energetic in- \\\\n terrogation, the voice seldom rises higher than an oc- \\\\n tave; though sometimes it extends to a tenth, or a \\\\n twelfth. The smallest concrete interval does not, per \\\\n haps, exceed a quarter tone. \\\\n \\\\n The concrete intervals of rising inflections are \\\\n greater than those of their corresponding falling inflec- \\\\n tions. This may be illustrated by pronouncing the \\\\n letter a interrogatively and affirmatively, several times, \\\\n with increasing energy, making the intervals of each \\\\n succeeding pair greater than those of the preceding, as \\\\n shown by the following diagram : \\\\n \\\\n * Cantabile, a term applied to movements intended to be per \\\\n formed in a graceful, elegant, and melodious style. — Busby\\\\\\'s Die \\\\n lionary of Music. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\\\\\ Gardiner\\\\\\'s Music of Nature, p. 164-5, London edition. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 50 (#60) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n50 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS, THROUGH VARIOU* \\\\n INTERVALS OF PITCH.

This is shown, in Diag. 11, by \\\\n the relative widths of the notes. \\\\n \\\\n Rising inflections are far more numerous than fall- \\\\n ing inflections : the former constitute the main body \\\\n of oral language, while the latter are employed for the \\\\n purposes of emphasis, and in the formation of cadences. \\\\n Rising inflections are often emphatic ; but their empha- \\\\n sis is weaker than that of falling inflections. \\\\n \\\\n The circumflexes are used for the purposes of em- \\\\n phasis.

These \\\\n movements of the voice, however, are seldom required ; \\\\n when improperly employed, they affect the ear of a \\\\n good reader as unpleasantly as the too frequent use of \\\\n the portamento does that of a good musician. \\\\n \\\\n * *\\\\\\' The circumflexes, acuto-grave\" says Mr. Steele, \" are cha- \\\\n racteristic of the Irish tone ; and the circumflexes, gravo-acute, are \\\\n characteristic of the Scottish tone.\" — (See Steele\\\\\\'s Prosodia Ra- \\\\n twnaiis.) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 51 (#61) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. 51 \\\\n \\\\n Writers on Elocution have given numerous rules foi \\\\n the regulation of inflections ; but most of these rules are \\\\n better calculated to make bad readers than good ones. \\\\n Those founded on the construction of sentences might, \\\\n perhaps, do credit to a mechanic, but they certainly do \\\\n none to an elocutionist. \\\\n \\\\n The subject is of such a nature that it would be \\\\n difficult, if. not impossible, to give rules for the regula- \\\\n tion of all the inflections of the voice, in reading and \\\\n speaking; and, as any rule on this part of elocution \\\\n must necessarily be limited in its application, I have \\\\n thought proper to dispense with them altogether. This \\\\n work, however, does not leave the reader without a \\\\n guide : in the practical part of it, numerous examples \\\\n are given, which, I trust, will have a tendency to form \\\\n a correct taste. When the student shall have acquired \\\\n a knowledge of the principles of elocution, he will have \\\\n no occasion for rules. \\\\n \\\\n The reader should bear in mind that a falling inflec- \\\\n tion gives more importance to a word than a rising in- \\\\n flection. Hence it should never be employed merely \\\\n for the sake of variety ; but for emphasis and cadences. \\\\n Neither should a rising inflection be used for the sake \\\\n of mere \"harmony\" where a falling inflection would \\\\n better express the meaning of the author. \\\\n \\\\n The sense should, in all cases, determine the direc- \\\\n tion of inflections.

The term harmony, as employed in \\\\n the science of music, signifies a union of melodies, a succession of \\\\n combined sounds, moving at consonant intervals, according to the \\\\n laws of modulation.* \\\\n \\\\n Notation is the graphic representation of a melody — \\\\n in other words, the expression of a melody by written \\\\n characters. \\\\n \\\\n Intonation is the act of sounding the notes of a me- \\\\n lody, either with the voice, or an instrument. When \\\\n each note is produced in its proper degree of pitch, the \\\\n intonation is true ; when the intervals are not observed \\\\n with exactness, the intonation is false. Correct into- \\\\n nation, in speech, is highly important : in song, and in- \\\\n strumental music, it is indispensable; for, if the intona- \\\\n tion is false, melody loses its charms, and harmony \\\\n becomes discord. \\\\n \\\\n The melody of speech is founded on sense ; that of \\\\n song, generally, on sound. Words containing opposite \\\\n \\\\n * The term harmonious is correctly employed when applied to \\\\n two or more sounds whose union is consonant, or agreeable ; it is \\\\n incorrectly employed when applied to the notes of a single melody, \\\\n as is done by some authors, who confound it with the word melo \\\\n dious. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 53 (#63) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. 53 \\\\n \\\\n sentiments may be sung to the same air, with effects \\\\n equally good, if the force and time be properly varied. \\\\n Tnus, if the two songs, March to the Battle Field, and \\\\n Oft in the Stilly Night, be sung to the same air — the \\\\n former with great force, and in quick time — the latter \\\\n with diminished force, and in slow time, there will be \\\\n as much difference of expression between them as there \\\\n is between that of joy and sorrow.* But speech is not \\\\n so accommodating. Here every sentence must not \\\\n only have its appropriate tune, but the tune must be \\\\n properly pitched. \\\\n \\\\n The melody of song is graduated on a scale whose \\\\n degrees are as definite as those of the scale of Gunter. \\\\n But the melody of speech is not formed with such ma- \\\\n thematical exactness — it has no scale of determinate \\\\n degrees. Hence it is difficult to represent it graphi- \\\\n cally — to give to each note \\\\n \\\\n \"A local habitation and a name.\" \\\\n \\\\n But even if an exact notation of the melody of speech \\\\n should be given, it is doubtful whether it would be of \\\\n much practical importance to the generality of man- \\\\n kind, as none but a Paganini would be able to read it. \\\\n Such a notation, however, is a desideratum — it would \\\\n be highly interesting to the philosopher ; and I would \\\\n advise all elocutionists who have a good ear for music, \\\\n and can perform on stringed instruments of the violin \\\\n species, to direct their attention to the subject.f \\\\n \\\\n For practical purposes, however, it is not essential \\\\n to present every syllable in speech under its proper \\\\n note, as is done in song : it is only necessary to give a \\\\n notation of the relative pitch of the emphatic syllables. \\\\n \\\\n * The reader must not infer that I entertain the opinion that in \\\\n song- melody cannot be adapted to sentiment. I believe that if the \\\\n composers of music were elocutionists, they would always construct \\\\n their melodies with reference to the sentiments to be expressed. \\\\n \\\\n f Any essays on this subject by one who cannot perform on a \\\\n musical instrument, must u>-ove entirely abortive. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 54 (#64) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nf>4 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n Such a notation may be read by those who have no \\\\n knowledge of music whatever, and, consequently, does \\\\n not require the aid of a Paganini. Besides, if the rela- \\\\n tive pitch of the heavy, or emphatic syllables, and their \\\\n inflections, are given, the light, or unemphatic sylla- \\\\n bles will naturally take their proper degrees of eleva- \\\\n tion. \\\\n \\\\n The series of notes by which the relative pitch, ana \\\\n inflections of the emphatic syllables are represented, \\\\n is denominated an emphasis melody. The emphasis \\\\n melodies are written on four horizontal, parallel lines. \\\\n These lines are called the staff of speech, in contradis- \\\\n tinction to the staffof music, which consists of five hori- \\\\n zontal, parallel lines, and the intermediate spaces. \\\\n \\\\n \"Ye are the things that tower, that shine, whose \\\\n smile makes glad, whose frown is terrible.\\\\\\'\\\\\\' \\\\n \\\\n In the above sentence there are four emphatic points, \\\\n which are represented by the following \\\\n \\\\n EXAMPLE OF EMPHASIS MELODY. (Diag. 12.) \\\\n \\\\n Staff of Speech.^ \\\\n \\\\n Pitch-Note Lino. \\\\n \\\\n tower, shine, glad, terrible. \\\\n \\\\n Each note in the above diagram has the falling inflec- \\\\n tion, and no two have the same radical pitch. There \\\\n is a gradual increase in the size of the notes from the \\\\n first to the last, which represents a gradual increase of \\\\n force, forming a sort of climax. \\\\n \\\\n In that part of this work which consists of Exer- \\\\n cises in Reading and Declamation, the notes of the \\\\n emphasis melodies are represented by graphic inflec- \\\\n tions placed at different degrees of elevation, thus: \\\\n \\\\n \" Ye are the things that tow er, that shine*, whose \\\\n smile makes glad\\\\\\', whose frown is terrible.\" \\\\n \\\\n In reading and speaking there is one note whicn \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 55 (#65) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. 55 \\\\n \\\\n predominates ; and in correct reading and speaking, the \\\\n pitch of this note is always in accordance with the \\\\n sentiment. This predominant, leading, or pitch-note \\\\n of speech, is written on the second line of the staff, \\\\n counting from below. To render the pitch-line con- \\\\n spicuous, it is made heavier than the other lines of the \\\\n staff. (See Diag. 12.) In the Exercises in Reading \\\\n and Declamation, the pitch-note is represented by the \\\\n graphic inflection which commences at the centre of \\\\n the body of the letter. (See the word shine, in the \\\\n foregoing example.) When one reads altogether in the \\\\n pitch-note, the reading is monotonous ; when the voice \\\\n is properly varied in pitch, it occasionally rises a de- \\\\n gree, or two degrees above, or descends a degree below \\\\n it, as represented by the staff. \\\\n \\\\n The reader must not conclude that the melody of \\\\n speech is confined to four degrees of pitch, whose inter- \\\\n vals are as determinate as those of the diatonic scale. \\\\n The intervals between the several notes of an empha- \\\\n sis melody vary according to circumstances. In ener- \\\\n getic declamation, and in interrogative and exclamatory \\\\n sentences, they may be said to be at their maximum ; \\\\n in solemn, and in plaintive discourse, at their minimum. \\\\n Neither must the reader conclude that the melody of \\\\n speech consists solely of emphasis melodies. These form, \\\\n as it were, the grand outlines of the picture, and the \\\\n notes of the syllables not included in the emphasis \\\\n melodies, constitute the filling up and the shading of it. \\\\n \\\\n The graphic notes of song represent absolute, as well \\\\n as relative pitch. But as the graphic notes of an em- \\\\n phasis melody of speech denote relative pitch only, two \\\\n emphasis melodies similarly constructed, though differ- \\\\n ent in their relative intervals, may be represented by \\\\n the same series of graphic notes. \\\\n \\\\n In reading emphasis melodies, beginners are apt to \\\\n make the intervals too great. Care should be taken \\\\n to avoid this fault, or the melody will be caricatured. \\\\n A little practice, under a good teacher, will enable \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 56 (#66) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n66 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n almost any one, who is not insensible to the changes \\\\n of pitch, to observe the proper intervals with tolerable \\\\n accuracy. And as these melodies are founded in the \\\\n nature of the subject, those who have a taste for elocu- \\\\n tion will scarcely require a teacher, for they will read \\\\n them, as it were, by intuition. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER III. \\\\n \\\\n MODULATION. \\\\n \\\\n MODULATION is a chang- \\\\n ing of the pitch-note to a \\\\n higher or lower degree of ele- \\\\n vation — in other words, it \\\\n is the process of changing the \\\\n key, or of passing from one \\\\n key to another. This change \\\\n is sometimes made to a proxi- \\\\n mate key ; at other times, a bold and abrupt transition \\\\n to a remote key is necessary to produce the desired \\\\n effect. Modulation is generally attended with a change \\\\n of force, or time; and, not unfrequently, with a change \\\\n of both. There is not a more important requisite in \\\\n Elocution — nothing which contributes more to the \\\\n pleasure of an audience — nothing which gives stronger \\\\n proof that an orator is master of his art, than a well- \\\\n regulated and expressive modulation. Modulation, \\\\n however, should never be resorted to for the sake of \\\\n mere variety — it should always be subservient to the \\\\n sense; for it is the province of modulation to mark \\\\n changes of sentiment, changes in the train of thought, \\\\n and parenthetical clauses. \\\\n \\\\n Under ordinary circumstances, the various modula- \\\\n tions of the voice, in reading and speaking, may be \\\\n represented by a staff of four lines. That this staff \\\\n may not be confounded with the staff of melody, de- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 57 (#67) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nPITCH. \\\\n \\\\n 57 \\\\n \\\\n scribed in the preceding chapter, it is made of lines \\\\n composed of dots, and called the staff of modulation. \\\\n The lines of this staff, like those of the staff of melody, \\\\n are counted from below upward. The second line is \\\\n called the pitch-note line of the staff of modulation. \\\\n \\\\n A series of modulations, as represented by the fol- \\\\n lowing diagram, might, very appropriately, be termed \\\\n a melody of melodies. \\\\n \\\\n A SERIES OP MODULATIONS.

This is shown in the preceding ex- \\\\n tract from Ossian\\\\\\'s Address to the Sun. No. 2 is pre- \\\\n fixed to the first section, to show that this section is to \\\\n be read in the pitch-note of modulation ; No. 3 is pre- \\\\n fixed to the second, section, to show that this section \\\\n should be read in the third degree of the staff of modu- \\\\n lation : No. 4 is prefixed to the third section, to show \\\\n that this section should be read in the fourth degree \\\\n of the staff of modulation ; No. 1 is prefixed to the \\\\n fourth section, to show that this section should be \\\\n read in the first degree of the staff of modulation ; and \\\\n so on. (See the Extract, and Diag. 13.) \\\\n \\\\n Some public speakers, who are ignorant of the principles of Elo- \\\\n cution, but who, nevertheless, are considered by the vulgar as \\\\n great orators, modulate their voices in the most erratic and hyper- \\\\n bolical manner. I once heard a clergyman pronounce the follow- \\\\n ing sentence in the way which I shall describe : \\\\n \\\\n \" While God\\\\\\'s omniscient eye passes from seat to seat, | and \\\\n ranges throughout the house, j he beholds what is passing in every \\\\n heart.\" \\\\n \\\\n The first section, while God\\\\\\'s omniscient eye passes from seat \\\\n to seat, he pronounced in the first degree above the lowest note of \\\\n his voice ; the second section, and ranges throughout the house, he \\\\n uttered with great force, in the highest note of his natural voice; \\\\n the third section, he beholds what is passing in every heart, he \\\\n pronounced with a mixture of vocality and aspiration, in the lowest \\\\n note of his voice. Such wild and extravagant transitions, though \\\\n they may astonish the ignorant, \" cannot but make the judicious \\\\n grieve.\" The manner in which the speaker pronounced the first \\\\n and third section in the above sentence, is good ; and had he pro- \\\\n nounced the second section in the same pitch and force with the \\\\n first, his elocution would have been faultless. \\\\n \\\\n There are other public speakers who never modulate their voices, \\\\n however necessary it may be to give proper expression to their sen- \\\\n timents; and, what is worse, they generally pitch their voices a \\\\n third, a fifth, or an octave too high. I once listened to an excellent \\\\n discourse, from a very learned man, which, however, was nearly \\\\n lost upon the audience from the disgusting manner in which it was \\\\n delivered. The lecturer pitched his voice an octave too high, and \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nFORCE, \\\\n \\\\n 59 \\\\n \\\\n spoke an hour and a half, without any variation in pitch, force, or \\\\n time; and, what rendered his delivery still more offensive, every \\\\n syllable was marred with an intolerable drawling. Such elocution \\\\n is discreditable to any man who speaks in public, and ought not to \\\\n be tolerated by an educated community. \\\\n \\\\n SECTION III. \\\\n \\\\n FORCE. \\\\n \\\\n ORCE is the degree of the loud- \\\\n ness of sounds. It is also the \\\\n degree of exertion with which \\\\n sounds are made. \\\\n \\\\n A lax division of force is into \\\\n loud and soft : those sounds are \\\\n called loud, which are made \\\\n with greater effort than the or- \\\\n dinary tones of conversation ; and those are called soft, \\\\n which are made with less effort. \\\\n \\\\n Some use the terms high and low, as synonymous with loud and \\\\n soft. But this is an improper application of these words. High \\\\n and low regard the acuteness and gravity of sounds only, and not \\\\n their force : a sound may be high and soft, as well as high and loud — \\\\n a sound may also be low and loud, as well as low and soft. \\\\n \\\\n For convenience, force is divided into nine degrees. \\\\n These degrees are expressed by the following abbre« \\\\n via t ions : \\\\n \\\\n PPP (pianissimo), .. as soft as possible. \\\\n \\\\n pp (piu piano), more soft, very soft. \\\\n \\\\n p (piano), soft. \\\\n \\\\n mp (mezzo piano), . . middling soft, rather soft. \\\\n \\\\n m (mezzo), half, middle, mean. \\\\n \\\\n mf (mezzo forte), . . middling loud, rather loud. \\\\n \\\\n / (forte), loud. \\\\n \\\\n ff (piii forte), more loud, very loud. \\\\n \\\\n (ff (fortissimo), ... as loud as possible. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 60 (#70) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n60 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n The nine degrees of force are represented by Diag. \\\\n 14.

The application \\\\n of force to sentences may be varied in the following \\\\n manner : \\\\n \\\\n 1. A sentence may be pronounced with uniform \\\\n force. \\\\n \\\\n 2. A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual \\\\n diminution of force. \\\\n \\\\n 3. A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual \\\\n increase of force. \\\\n \\\\n 4. The first part of a sentence may be pronounced \\\\n with a gradual increase of force, and the second part, \\\\n with a gradual diminution of force. \\\\n \\\\n 5. The first part of a sentence may be pronounced \\\\n with a gradual diminution of force, and the second part, \\\\n with a gradual increase of force. \\\\n \\\\n Force, however, is generally applied to sentences in \\\\n a more irregular manner. It should always be varied \\\\n according to the varying demands of sentiment. \\\\n \\\\n Force, applied to a note, or syllable, is denominated \\\\n stress. \\\\n \\\\n Radical stress is the application of force at the be- \\\\n ginning of a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the \\\\n diminuendo, in music. \\\\n \\\\n Median stress is the application of force at the middle \\\\n of a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the swell, or \\\\n crescendo et diminuendo, in music. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 61 (#71) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nFORCE. \\\\n \\\\n 61 \\\\n \\\\n Final stress is the application of force at the end of \\\\n a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the crescendo, or \\\\n ratner, rinforzando,* in music. \\\\n \\\\n Explosive stress is the abrupt application of force to \\\\n a note, or syllable; it corresponds to the forzando, in \\\\n music.f \\\\n \\\\n Diagram 15. \\\\n \\\\n Radical Stress. \\\\n \\\\n Median Stress. \\\\n \\\\n Final Stress. \\\\n \\\\n d? \\\\n \\\\n a. \\\\n \\\\n d? \\\\n \\\\n d? \\\\n \\\\n Tremour is iterated stress on a note, or syllable. \\\\n Examples of the tremour are given in the following \\\\n diagram : \\\\n \\\\n (Diag. 16.) \\\\n \\\\n d ? it. \\\\n \\\\n The tremour, in all its forms, may be illustrated on \\\\n the violin by sounding the notes with a vibratory mo- \\\\n tion of the bow. \\\\n \\\\n Great attention should be paid to the subject of \\\\n force, as much of what is called expression, depends on \\\\n some modification of this attribute of the voice. In- \\\\n \\\\n * Rinforzando is a sudden increase of sound from softness to \\\\n loudness. \\\\n \\\\n f Nathan, in his Essay on the History and Theory of Music. \\\\n has given diagrams representing sixty modifications of force appli- \\\\n cable to the voice of song - . \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 62 (#72) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n62 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n deed, force may be considered the light and shade or \\\\n elocution. \\\\n \\\\n \" Mr. Alison observes, that loud sounds are connected with ideas \\\\n of power and danger; and that many objects in nature, which have \\\\n such qualities, are distinguished by such sounds. On the contrary, \\\\n soft sounds are connected with ideas of gentleness and delicacy. \\\\n The contrasts produced by the different degrees of force with which \\\\n sounds are uttered, form the most prominent effects of musical ex- \\\\n pression. The rushing of the fortissimo brings with it dread and \\\\n alarm ; but in the pianissimo, the chiaroscuro* of the art, we feel \\\\n the opposite sensation. The indistinctness of sounds apparently \\\\n removes them to a distance — like the faint touches in painting, \\\\n they seem to retire from us. Upon this principle, the ventriloquist \\\\n deceives the ear, by directing the attention to a point from which \\\\n the voice may be supposed to proceed ; and effects the deception by \\\\n reducing it to the exact degree of softness that it would seem to \\\\n possess had it really proceeded from the spot.\" \\\\n \\\\n CRESCENDO AND DIMINUENDO. \\\\n \\\\n \" What is more alarming than the gradual increase of a mighty \\\\n sound, when it pours upon the ear from a distance; — whether it \\\\n proceeds from the roar of a multitude, or the raging of a storm, the \\\\n auditory sense is overwhelmed, and the mind is filled with imagi- \\\\n nary danger ! When the increasing force accumulates to excessive \\\\n loudness, the vibrations become too great for the soul to bear. \\\\n There is also a sublimity in the gradual decrease of sounds. \\\\n \\\\n \" It is equally sublime to listen to sounds when they retire from \\\\n us. Handel has aimed at this poetic effect in the \\\\\\' Messiah,\\\\\\'\\\\\\' when \\\\n he pictures the ascent of the heavenly host, giving an idea of theii \\\\n distance and flight. \\\\n \\\\n \"There is no accomplishment in the art of singing more fascinat- \\\\n ing than the swelling and dying rfway of the voice; — when used \\\\n with taste and judgment, it never fails to delight us. The perform- \\\\n ance of the \\\\\\'■Miserere,\\\\\\'\\\\\\' in the Sixtine Chapel, in Rome, so often \\\\n described by travellers, owes its shadowy effect to this approaching \\\\n and retiring of the sounds. Farinelli moved his audience to a state \\\\n of ecstasy by the manner in which he commenced his famous song \\\\n \\\\\\' Son qual nave,\\\\\\'\\\\\\' \\\\\\' the first note of which was taken with such deli- \\\\n cacy, swelled by minute degrees to such an amazing volume, and \\\\n afterwards diminished in the same manner to a mere point, that it \\\\n was applauded for five minutes.\\\\\\' Beethoven is the only composer \\\\n who has introduced this effect into choral music: we find it applied \\\\n at the termination of some of the choruses in his posthumous Mass; \\\\n — here the voices alone pour upon the ear with an effect like the \\\\n swelling and dying away of the storm. \\\\n \\\\n Chiaroscuro (Italian), the light of a shsde of a picture. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 63 (#73) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nTIME. \\\\n \\\\n <33 \\\\n \\\\n FORZANDO. \\\\n \\\\n \" Explosive force forms a strong feature in the character of mo- \\\\n dern music ; we never find it expressed in any author before the \\\\n time of Haydn.

Hence the rhythm of speech, like its melody, is \\\\n more or less irregular. \\\\n \\\\n The time of a note, or syllable, is called quantity. \\\\n The time of a rest is also called quantity ; because \\\\n rests, as well as notes, are a constituent of rhythm \\\\n Hence the characters used for the expression of quan- \\\\n tity, are either of sound or silence.

Solemn discourse requires a slow \\\\n movement ; simple narrative, a medium rate of utter- \\\\n ance ; animated description, as well as all language \\\\n expressive of any sudden passion, as joy, anger, &c, a \\\\n movement more or less rapid, according to the inten- \\\\n sity of emotion. In the science of music, various terms \\\\n have been employed to denote the rate of movement, \\\\n the principal of which are the following : \\\\n \\\\n Adagio, very slow ; the slowest time. \\\\n \\\\n Largo, slow time. \\\\n \\\\n Larghetto, . . . slow, but not so slow as largo. \\\\n Andante,. . . . medium time. \\\\n Andantino, . . a little quicker than andante. \\\\n Allegretto,. . . rather quick, but not so quick as allegro. \\\\n Allegro, .... quick time. \\\\n \\\\n Presto, very quick. \\\\n \\\\n Prestissimo . . as quick as possible. \\\\n \\\\n Adagio, andante and allegro, are the three chief di- \\\\n visions of time ; the other terms mark the intermediate \\\\n degrees. \\\\n \\\\n In addition to the foregoing terms, which mark the \\\\n movement, there are others, which indicate the style \\\\n of performance. Some of these are as follows : \\\\n \\\\n Affetuoso, . . affectionate — a soft and delicate style of performance. \\\\n Brilldnte,. . shining, sparkling — a gay, showy style. \\\\n Furioso,. . . fierce, mad — a vehement style. \\\\n Spiritoso,. . spirited — a spirited style. \\\\n \\\\n Sometimes these terms are used in connexion w 7 ith \\\\n those which express the rate of movement, thus : — \\\\n \\\\n Allegro con spirito, quick with spirit — in a quick and spirited \\\\n manner. \\\\n \\\\n The rate of movement is not definitely marked by \\\\n the terms Adagio, Largo, Larghetto, &c. ; it may, how- \\\\n ever, be designated with precision by means of the \\\\n \\\\n METROTOME OF MAELZEL. \\\\n \\\\n This instrument has a graduated pendulum, to which \\\\n is attached a sliding weight. The higher this w r eight \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 67 (#77) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nTIME. \\\\n \\\\n 6? \\\\n \\\\n is moved upon the pendulum, the \\\\n slower are its vibrations ; and the \\\\n contrary. When the weight cor- \\\\n responds to the number 50, the vi- \\\\n brations of the pendulum are the \\\\n slowest; when it corresponds to \\\\n 160, they are the quickest. All \\\\n the numbers on the instrument \\\\n have reference to suninute of time. \\\\n Thus, when the weight is placed \\\\n at 50, fifty beats, or ticks, occur \\\\n in a minte ; when at 60, sixty beats \\\\n in a minute ; when at 100, one \\\\n hundred beats in a minute, &c. \\\\n The engraving in the margin represents the instrument \\\\n in action. \\\\n \\\\n In reading, as a general rule, the time should be \\\\n marked on the metronome by whole measures — in \\\\n other words, each measure should correspond to one \\\\n tick of the instrument. \\\\n \\\\n In music, it is most convenient to mark the time on \\\\n the metronome in adagios, by quavers ; in andantes, by \\\\n crotchets ; in allegros, by minims ; and in prestos, by \\\\n whole measures. \\\\n \\\\n EXAMPLES OP THE SEVERAL MOVEMENTS. \\\\n \\\\n In the following Examples, the words which indi- \\\\n cate the movement and the corresponding numbers on \\\\n the metronome, are both employed. \\\\n \\\\n J. !

Hence its cultivation is of primary importance \\\\n to those who are ambitious of accomplishment in Elo- \\\\n cution. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER I. \\\\n \\\\n POSTURES OF THE BODY. \\\\n \\\\n The postures of the body, with respect to vocal \\\\n delivery, may be divided into favourable and unfavour- \\\\n able ; and, the better to suit my purpose in giving their \\\\n illustration, I shall first treat of the unfavourable. \\\\n \\\\n The most unfavourable posture is the horizontal. If \\\\n a reader or a speaker should lie prone, or supine, he \\\\n would not be likely to deliver a discourse with energy \\\\n and effect. I have never known an orator to deliver \\\\n a discourse in the horizontal posture ; but I have known \\\\n individuals to speak in public in postures almost as in- \\\\n appropriate. \\\\n \\\\n As impressions communicated through the medium \\\\n of the eye, are the most lasting, two series of figures are \\\\n \\\\n (69) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n70 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n here introduced, the former of which are unfavourable, \\\\n and the latter favourable, to vocal delivery. \\\\n \\\\n POSTURES UNFAVOURABLE TO VOCAL DELIVERY. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 71 (#81) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 71 \\\\n \\\\n POSTURES FAVOURABLE TO VOCAL DELIVERY. \\\\n \\\\n DEMONSTRATING ON THE BLACK-BOARD. \\\\n \\\\n ■Hi \\\\n \\\\n Absurd as are the unfavourable postures on page 70, \\\\n f have known readers to adopt not only all these, but \\\\n others equally inappropriate and ridiculous. This is \\\\n too much the case, particularly in seminaries for young \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 72 (#82) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n72 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n gentlemen, in a number of which it has fallen torn* \\\\n lot to give instruction in Elocution. \\\\n \\\\n The human mind is so constituted, that, in its edu- \\\\n cation, order becomes almost indispensable. Hence, \\\\n any thing that interrupts methodical instruction, is a \\\\n serious obstacle to the growth of intellect. Nor is \\\\n order more necessary than perseverance ; consequently \\\\n all postures of the body which are calculated for re \\\\n pose, should be avoided by the student in elocution \\\\n And as grace and dignity are of primary importance \\\\n in vOcal delivery, all postures which are inconsistent \\\\n with these attributes should also be avoided. \\\\n \\\\n The erect posture of the body is the best for vocal \\\\n delivery ; the trunk and limbs should be braced in pro- \\\\n portion to the degree of energy required by the senti- \\\\n ments to be delivered. The right foot should be from \\\\n two to four inches in advance of the left, and the toes \\\\n turned a little outwards ; meanwhile the body should \\\\n be principally sustained by the left foot. \\\\n \\\\n The next best is the erect sitting posture, in which \\\\n the shoulders do not rest against the back of the seat, \\\\n and in which the body is retained in its proper posi- \\\\n tion by muscular action. (See Ornamental Letter, \\\\n page 11 and 16.) \\\\n \\\\n The next best is the erect sitting posture in which \\\\n the shoulders rest against the back of the seat. \\\\n \\\\n These are the only postures which are at all favour- \\\\n able to vocal delivery. \\\\n \\\\n MANNER OF HOLDING THE BOOK. \\\\n \\\\n The book should be held in the left hand, from six \\\\n to eight inches from the body, and as high as the centre \\\\n of the breast, so as to bring the face nearly perpendi- \\\\n cular. It should not, however, be held so high as to \\\\n prevent the audience from having a view of the reader\\\\\\'s \\\\n mouth, as his voice would thereby be more or less ob- \\\\n structed. The fingers of the right hand may take hold \\\\n of the margin of the book lightly (see Fig. 10, and Orna- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 73 (#83) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 73 \\\\n \\\\n mental Letter, page 16), so as to be ready to turn over the \\\\n leaves, as occasion may require ; or they may be placed \\\\n upon the page, just below the line the reader is pronounc- \\\\n ing, to aid him in keeping his place ; or, particularly \\\\n if the reader is pronouncing an original composition, \\\\n the right hand may be employed to illustrate and en- \\\\n force the sentiments by appropriate gesticulation. (See \\\\n Fig. 11.) If the reader be a lady, the right hand may \\\\n support the left arm. (See Fig. 12.) I do not, how- \\\\n ever, advise ladies to adopt this posture exclusively, \\\\n but deem it not ungraceful for them. \\\\n \\\\n The eyes should occasionally be directed from the \\\\n words of the discourse to the audience. (See Fig. 11.) \\\\n \\\\n In demonstrating on the black-board, the face, and \\\\n not the back, should be turned to the audience. (See \\\\n Fig. 13 and 14.) \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER II. \\\\n \\\\n NOTATION OF GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n The want of a language for expressing the different \\\\n modifications of gesture with brevity and perspicuity, \\\\n is the principal cause of the general neglect with which \\\\n the cultivation of this art has hitherto been treated. \\\\n For this desideratum the world is indebted to the Rev. \\\\n Gilbert Austin, of London. In 1806, this distinguished \\\\n elocutionist published a quarto volume of six hundred \\\\n pages ; and from that work I have taken the system \\\\n of notation of which the following is a specimen : \\\\n \\\\n When the right arm is elevated backwards, and the \\\\n left extended forwards, in a horizontal direction, he \\\\n calls the posture of the former elevated backwards, and \\\\n notes it eb ; and the posture of the latter, horizontal \\\\n forwards, and notes it hf Now the abbreviations eb \\\\n and hf are placed over any word which requires these \\\\n postures of the arms, thus : — \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 74 (#84) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nT4 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n eb — hf \\\\n \\\\n Jehovah\\\\\\'s arm \\\\n \\\\n Snatch\\\\\\'d from the waves, and brings to me my son !* \\\\n \\\\n Douglas, Act 111 \\\\n \\\\n For an illustration of these gestures, the reader is \\\\n referred to the ornamental letter on page 69. \\\\n \\\\n The original idea of this system of notation, says Mr. \\\\n Austin, was suggested by the labour of teaching decla- \\\\n mation in the usual manner. During this labour, which \\\\n for many years constituted a part of his duty in his \\\\n grammar-school, the author having often found that he \\\\n forgot, on a following day, his own mode of instructing \\\\n on a former, wished to be able to invent some perma- \\\\n nent marks, in order to establish more uniformity in \\\\n his instructions, for the ease both of himself and of his \\\\n pupils. The mode of instruction is not so liable to \\\\n change, with respect to the expression of the voice, and \\\\n countenance, for this is always pointed out by the sen- \\\\n timent. But the great difficulty lies in ascertaining \\\\n and marking the suitable gesture ; and for these ob- \\\\n vious reasons ; because a language of gesture was want- \\\\n ing, and because gesture may be infinitely varied, and \\\\n yet, perhaps, be equally just. To leave the pupil to \\\\n choose for himself would but distract him, and, instead \\\\n of giving him freedom and grace, would deprive him \\\\n of both. On his commencement as a public speaker \\\\n (which cannot be too early), it is necessary to teach \\\\n him every thing, and to regulate, by rules, every pos- \\\\n sible circumstance in his delivery ; his articulation, \\\\n accent, emphasis, pauses, &c, and along with all, his \\\\n gesture. After sufficient instruction and practice, he \\\\n will regulate his own manner, according to the sugges- \\\\n tions of his judgment and taste. \\\\n \\\\n Among the higher objects of this system of notation, \\\\n may be reckoned its uses as a record, whence the his- \\\\n \\\\n * Although an explanation of the gestures on Jehovah\\\\\\'s arm, in \\\\n the above sentence, is sufficient to answer my present purpose, it \\\\n may not be improper to inform the reader that another gesture is \\\\n required on the word son. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 75 (#85) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 75 \\\\n \\\\n torical painter may derive the materials of truth, and \\\\n whence the orator and the elocutionist may not only \\\\n obtain the instructions of the great men who have pre- \\\\n ceded them in the same career, but by which also they \\\\n may secure, unalterably, their own improvements for \\\\n the advancement of their art, and for the benefit of \\\\n posterity. A scene of Shakspeare, or a passage of Mil- \\\\n ton, so noted, after the manner of a great master of \\\\n recitation, or an oration so noted as delivered by an \\\\n admired speaker, would prove an enduring study of \\\\n truth and nature combined with imagination. And the \\\\n aspiring orator would not be obliged, as at present, to \\\\n invent for himself an entire system of action. He might \\\\n derive light from the burning lamps of the dead, and \\\\n proceed at once, by their guidance, towards the highest \\\\n honours of his profession. \\\\n \\\\n Had the ancients possessed the art of notating their \\\\n delivery, such was the unwearied diligence of their \\\\n great orators, Demosthenes and Cicero, that we should, \\\\n most probably, at this day, be in possession of their \\\\n manner of delivery, as well as the matter of their ora- \\\\n tions ; and not be limited to conjecture relative to a \\\\n single sentence of these eminent speakers, on the great \\\\n occasions which called forth their powers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 76 (#86) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n76 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER III. \\\\n \\\\n POSITION OF THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS. \\\\n \\\\n The parts of the human figure which are brought \\\\n into action, in gesture, cannot, in truth, be considered \\\\n separate ; for every muscle, over which men can exer- \\\\n cise voluntary action, contributes, in some measure, to \\\\n the perfection of gesture. For, convenience, how T ever, \\\\n we may enumerate and class the most distinguished \\\\n parts of the body, which effect the principal gestures. \\\\n These are : \\\\n \\\\n 1. The Head. 5. The Hands and Fingers. \\\\n \\\\n 2. The Shoulders. 6. The Low r ER Limbs and \\\\n \\\\n 3. The Trunk. Knees. \\\\n \\\\n 4. The Arms. 7. The Feet. \\\\n \\\\n I shall begin, as it were, with the foundation of the \\\\n building, and shall first consider the positions and \\\\n motions of the feet and lower limbs ; since without the \\\\n stability and ease of these, neither grace nor dignity \\\\n can consist in the standing figure. \\\\n \\\\n As the object of the orator is to persuade, and as \\\\n prejudice against his person or manners may greatly \\\\n impede him, he must recommend himself by every at- \\\\n tention to his external deportment which may be \\\\n deemed correct and proper ; and guard against every \\\\n species of inelegance that may prove disadvantageous. \\\\n He must, therefore, even in his posture as he stands, \\\\n prefer manly dignity and grace to awkward rusticity \\\\n and rude strength. Rude strength may suit him who \\\\n wishes to terrify, or to insult ; but this is rarely the \\\\n purpose of a public speaker. Grace and decorum win \\\\n favour; and this is the general object. Rude strength \\\\n stands indeed with stability, but. without grace. \\\\n \\\\n The gracefulness of motion in the human form, or \\\\n perhaps in any other, consists in the facility and secu- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 77 (#87) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 77 \\\\n \\\\n nty with which it is executed. And the grace of any \\\\n postures (except such as are manifestly designed for \\\\n repose), consists in the apparent facility with which \\\\n they can be varied. Hence, in the standing figure, the \\\\n posture is graceful when the weight of the body is \\\\n principally supported by one limb, whilst the other is \\\\n so placed as to be ready to relieve it promptly, and \\\\n without effort. And as the limbs are formed for a \\\\n mutual share of labour and of honour, so their alterna- \\\\n tion in posture, and in motion, is agreeable and grace- \\\\n ful. \\\\n \\\\n The body must then be supported, if grace be con- \\\\n sulted, on either limb, like Apollo, Antinous, and other \\\\n beautiful and well-executed statues. \\\\n \\\\n The positions of the feet are expressed by the nota- \\\\n tion annexed, which is to be written under the word \\\\n where the speaker is to assume such position. They \\\\n are the follow in 2 : \\\\n \\\\n First Position of the Right Foot, noted R. 1. (See Fig. 15) \\\\n \\\\n The upper part of the figure represents the eleva- \\\\n tion of the position ; the lower, the plan. \\\\n \\\\n In this position the right foot (advanced before the \\\\n eft about the breadth of the foot), \\\\n orms, with the left, an an^le of \\\\n about seventy-five degrees, as may \\\\n be seen in the plan. The lines \\\\n which form this angle, passing \\\\n through the length of each foot, \\\\n meet its vertex under the heel of \\\\n the left. The principal weight of \\\\n the body is sustained by the left \\\\n foot ; the right rests lightly, but in \\\\n its whole length, upon the floor. \\\\n This fact is shown in the plan by deeply shading the \\\\n left foot, and lightly shading the right. \\\\n 6 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 78 (#88) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n78 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n Second Position of the Right Foot >notedR. 2. \\\\n \\\\n In this position, the right foot sliding forward about \\\\n half its length, receives the principal \\\\n weight of the body, the left being \\\\n raised, and turning as far inwards \\\\n towards the right ; the ball of the \\\\n left great toe only lightly touching \\\\n the floor, to keep the body from tot- \\\\n tering. In the plan, the right foot, \\\\n by which the weight of the body is \\\\n principally sustained, is all shaded, \\\\n while that part only of the left is \\\\n shaded which rests upon the floor. \\\\n \\\\n The angle formed by lines drawn through the length \\\\n \\\\n of the feet, in this position, is about ninety degrees. \\\\n In this position, when the feet are near together, the \\\\n \\\\n entire sole of the left foot may lightly touch the floor ; \\\\n \\\\n but when the feet are separated about their own length, \\\\n \\\\n or more, the left should touch only near the great toe ; \\\\n \\\\n the knee should be bent, and the heel turned inward, \\\\n \\\\n as in Fig. 24 and 26. \\\\n \\\\n First Position of th* Left Foot, noted L. 1.

F., is when the body is supported on the right \\\\n foot. The position in front is used when persons are \\\\n addressed alternately, on either side, whilst the audi- \\\\n tors are in front, as on the stage. It is not graceful, \\\\n and should not often be used ; it is too stiff and formal, \\\\n like the military figure, and presents the body with too \\\\n much uniformity and flatness.* \\\\n \\\\n * This appears to be the position condemned by Qumtilian : \\\\n \" The swing of those who balance their body to the right side and \\\\n left, upon the alternate feet, is very ungraceful.\" \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 81 (#91) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 81 \\\\n \\\\n Connected with these positions which express the \\\\n moderate state of the feet, are marked the same posi- \\\\n tions in the extended state. (Fig. 20.) These differ \\\\n from the moderate, principally, in the greater separa- \\\\n tion of the feet. The second position extended, en- \\\\n larges the angle a few degrees by drawing up the heel \\\\n of the retired foot. (See Fig. 46 and 89.) The first \\\\n extended position is made when a person retires in any \\\\n degree of alarm; and the second, when he advances \\\\n with boldness. (See Fig. 106 and 108.) An x is added \\\\n to the notation to express the extended position, thus ; \\\\n R. 1. x; R. 2. x; &c. \\\\n \\\\n The contracted position may be easily understood by \\\\n supposing the heels to be brought close together. A c \\\\n is added to the notation, to express the contracted \\\\n position, thus: R. 1. c. \\\\n \\\\n The attitude of the orator should not be like that of \\\\n the affected dancing-master, which is adapted to spring- \\\\n ing agility and conceited display. The orator should \\\\n adopt such attitudes and positions only as consist with \\\\n manly simplicity and grace. The toes should be turned, \\\\n not inwards, like those of the awkward rustic, but \\\\n moderately outwards ; and the limbs should be so dis- \\\\n posed as to support the body with ease, and to change \\\\n with facility. The sustaining foot should be planted \\\\n firmly; the leg braced, but not contracted; and the \\\\n knee straightened (contraction suits the spring neces- \\\\n sary for the dancer, and bent knees belong to feeble- \\\\n ness, or timidity) ; the other foot and limb should press \\\\n lightly, and be held relaxed, so as to be ready for im- \\\\n mediate change and action, except in very energetic \\\\n delivery, where both limbs should be braced. The \\\\n trunk of the body should be well balanced, and sus- \\\\n tained erect upon the supporting limb, except in such \\\\n instances as particularly require its inclination, as \\\\n veneration, supplication, &c. The orator should face \\\\n his audience. Whatever his position may be, he should \\\\n present himself, as Quintilian expresses, cequo pectore \\\\n (Fig. 13), and never in the fencer\\\\\\'s attitude. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 82 (#92) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n82 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n In changing the positions of the feet, the motions \\\\n should be made with the utmost simplicity, and free \\\\n from the parade and SAveep of dancing. All changes, \\\\n except where particular energy requires the speaker to \\\\n stamp, start back, or advance with marked decision, \\\\n should be made almost imperceptibly. The changes \\\\n should not be too frequent : frequent change gives the \\\\n idea of anxiety and instability, which are unfavourable \\\\n to an orator. \\\\n \\\\n The several acts resulting from the changes in the \\\\n positions of the feet, are, advancing (noted a) ; re- \\\\n tiring (r) ; traversing (tr.) ; starting (s. or st.) ; stamp- \\\\n ing {sp.),&LC. \\\\n \\\\n If more steps than one are to be expressed (as in the \\\\n business of the theatre) the number may be introduced \\\\n in a parenthesis, after the letter marking the step, and \\\\n then the position follows which finishes the movement ; \\\\n thus, a (2) R. 2, means, advance two steps to the se- \\\\n cond position of the right foot. In private declama- \\\\n tions, or recitations on a platform, or rostrum, these \\\\n figures are not necessary, as a single step, in advancing \\\\n or retiring, is sufficient.* \\\\n \\\\n Changes of position, or steps, are considered to be \\\\n made only by the foot on which the body is not sup- \\\\n ported, for that alone is free. Should it be required to \\\\n move the foot which supports the body (suppose the \\\\n left, in the first position of the right, Fig. 15), two mo- \\\\n \\\\n * I have frequently seen college students take three steps to the \\\\n right, then three to the left, then three again to the right, and so \\\\n on, till they had changed their position fifteen times during the de- \\\\n livery of a discourse which did not occupy them more than ten \\\\n minutes. And I have known a clergyman to traverse the whole \\\\n length of his pulpit twenty-three times during the delivery of a ser- \\\\n mon. Such erratic movements in a public speaker are undigni- \\\\n fied : they betray a want of judgment, and are exceedingly annoy- \\\\n ing to an audience. An orator should \"keep in his place:\" he \\\\n should perform all the movements of his feet within the limits of \\\\n thirty-six inches square, and not be continually running about the \\\\n room ad if labouring under the effects of nitrous oxide. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 83 (#93) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n 83 \\\\n \\\\n ^ \\\\n \\\\n xX.i \\\\n \\\\n tions are necessary ; in the first the position must be \\\\n changed to R. 2. (Fig. 16), so as to throw the weight \\\\n of the body on the right foot, then the left may be \\\\n moved as required. \\\\n \\\\n According to this principle, it will be found that \\\\n from each original &.&.% \\\\n \\\\n position four steps \\\\n may be made. (See \\\\n Fig. 21 and 22.) \\\\n The plan of the \\\\n steps, in the origi- \\\\n nal position, is in \\\\n the centre, and \\\\n drawn larger ; the \\\\n plan of the steps, \\\\n made from that ori- \\\\n ginal position, is re- \\\\n presented smaller. \\\\n The line of motions \\\\n of the feet, is repre- 21 \\\\n \\\\n sented by a line of dots, nearly of the same form which \\\\n each foot should trace ; the line of the free, or first- \\\\n moving foot, is marked with a star. In the figures, it \\\\n will be observed, that from each position four steps \\\\n may be made — the speaker may advance, retire, tra- \\\\n verse, and cross. In \\\\n advancing and tra- \\\\n versing, each step \\\\n finishes on the second \\\\n position of the ad- \\\\n vancing foot ; and, \\\\n in retiring from the \\\\n first position, the step \\\\n finishes on the first \\\\n position of the con- \\\\n trary foot; but, in \\\\n retiring from the se- \\\\n cond position, it fin- \\\\n ishes on the first \\\\n \\\\n a.L.2. \\\\n \\\\n tr.Ki \\\\n \\\\n K.2. \\\\n \\\\n c Jl.x \\\\n \\\\n l.R.l \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 84 (#94) ##############################################\\\\n\\\\n84 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n position of the same foot.

It \\\\n the passage to be delivered may properly be illustrated \\\\n by the arm in the posture horizontal extended (hx), the \\\\n degree of that extension should vary with the spirit of \\\\n \\\\n the passage. If an object is \\\\n simply pointed to in the hori-* — \\\\n zon, the arm should be mode- \\\\n rately extended (Fig. 45), and \\\\n slightly bent at the shoulder, \\\\n the elbow, and the wrist. If \\\\n the object is highly interesting, \\\\n and supposed to be in the same \\\\n situation as if a general pointed \\\\n to those troops which he re- \\\\n quired to be instantly sustained, \\\\n the arm should be extended to \\\\n the utmost, the wrist thrown \\\\n up, and the fingers down, whilst \\\\n the whole body should be projected forwards \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 92 (#102) #############################################\\\\n\\\\n92 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n 46.) The arm, in this posture, as in the last, is col- \\\\n sidered still to be horizontal extended, but in the ex~ \\\\n treme degree, and is marked with an additional x (hxx). \\\\n If the object in the same situation as before be sup- \\\\n posed something producing disappointment, or horror \\\\n the arm should be contracted, and the whole person \\\\n should recoil.

Seve- \\\\n ral of these dispositions of the fingers are employed by \\\\n our speakers, but without attaching to them any par- \\\\n ticular significancy. Either they are natural gestures, \\\\n or they are imitations, of which the origin is not re- \\\\n membered, or regarded, as many of our apparently \\\\n original actions are. \\\\n \\\\n The postures of the hand are determined by four \\\\n different circumstances : \\\\n \\\\n 1. By the disposition of the fingers. \\\\n \\\\n 2. By the manner of presenting the palm. \\\\n \\\\n 3. By the combined disposition of both hands. \\\\n \\\\n 4. By the part of the body on which they are occa- \\\\n sionally placed. \\\\n \\\\n First Class of the Postures of the Hands, depending on \\\\n the Disposition of the Fingers. \\\\n \\\\n The natural state, noted n., Fig. 51. The hand, \\\\n when unconstrained, in its natural, and relaxed state, \\\\n either hanging down at rest, or raised moderately up \\\\n has all the fingers a little bent inwards towards the \\\\n \\\\n 7 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 94 (#104) #############################################\\\\n\\\\n94 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n palm ; the middle and third finger lightly touch ; the \\\\n fore-finger is separated from the middle finger, and less \\\\n bent, and the little finger separated from the third, and \\\\n more bent. The extremity of the thumb bends a little \\\\n outwards; and, in its general length and disposition, is \\\\n nearly parallel with the fore-finger. When the arm is \\\\n raised horizontal, the hand is held obliquely between \\\\n the postures inward and supine. Cresoilius recom- \\\\n mends the public speaker to adopt this posture of the \\\\n hand, and for this preference he adduces the authority \\\\n of Hippocrates and Galen. But it is not necessary that \\\\n a speaker should confine himself to any one posture of \\\\n the hand ; variety may often demand the contrary : if \\\\n however, he should prefer using only \\\\n one, this posture merits the preference. \\\\n \\\\n Clinched, c, Fig. 52. The fingers, in this disposition, \\\\n are firmly closed, and press their extremities upon the \\\\n palm ; the thumb aids the pressure, and is lapped, par- \\\\n ticularly, over the middle finger. \\\\n \\\\n Extended, xf* Fig. 53. The fingers, in this state, \\\\n whatever may be the general position of the hand, are \\\\n separated from each other with energy in proportion to \\\\n the excitation of the speaker. \\\\n \\\\n Index, i, Fig. 54, 55, 56.

This \\\\n must be obvious to all who reflect that the effect of the \\\\n posture greatly depends upon the exact character of \\\\n the motion, which is produced partly by the direction \\\\n which the motion takes, partly by the force with which \\\\n it is commenced, and partly by the distance through \\\\n which it passes. \\\\n \\\\n The motions of the hands and arms together, are, \\\\n therefore, considered ; first, as to their direction ; and, \\\\n secondly, as to their manner of moving. The energy \\\\n is not here taken into account. These motions are \\\\n noted by the fourth and fifth small letters, should so \\\\n many be necessary. \\\\n \\\\n In the direction of the motion (Fig. 85), gestures are \\\\n considered as ascending, noted a ; descending, d; to \\\\n the right, r; to the left,/; forwards,/; backwards, \\\\n b ; revolving.* v.

The \\\\n movements of the head should be suited to the charac- \\\\n ter of the delivery ; they should accord with the ges- \\\\n ture, and fall in with the action of the hands, and the \\\\n motions of the body. \\\\n \\\\n The head is capable of many appropriate expres- \\\\n sions. Besides those nods which signify assent, or ap- \\\\n probation and rejection, there are motions of the head, \\\\n known, and common to all, which express modesty, \\\\n doubt, admiration and indignation. But to use the \\\\n gesture of the head alone, unaccompanied by any other \\\\n gesture, is considered faulty. It is also a fault to shake \\\\n or nod the head frequently, to toss it violently, or to \\\\n agitate the hair, by rolling it about. \\\\n \\\\n The most usual motions and postures of the head, \\\\n are as follows. In the notation, the head and eyes \\\\n may, without confusion, be considered together. \\\\n \\\\n Postures and Motions of \\\\n the Head. \\\\n \\\\n Inclined, noted - - I \\\\n \\\\n Erect, \" - - E \\\\n \\\\n Assenting, \" - - As \\\\n \\\\n Direction of the Eyes. \\\\n \\\\n Forwards, noted - • F \\\\n Averted, \" - - A \\\\n \\\\n Downwards, \" - - D \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 105 (#115) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 105 \\\\n \\\\n Denying, \" - - Dn Upward, \" - - U \\\\n \\\\n Shaking, \" - - Sh Around, \" - - R \\\\n \\\\n Tossing, \" - - Ts Vacuity, or \" \\\\n \\\\n Aside, \" - - S Vacancy,* \" - - V \\\\n \\\\n The motions of the trunk contribute much to the \\\\n effect in delivery. The gestures of the arms and hands, \\\\n therefore, should always be supported by the accom- \\\\n paniment of the body. Not by affected and ridiculous \\\\n contortions, but by the manly and free exertions of the \\\\n muscles of the body, the general consent of which is \\\\n indispensable to the production of graceful motion. \\\\n The raising up, or shrugging of the shoulders, in ordei \\\\n to express indifference, or contempt, is merely theatri- \\\\n cal, and should be sparingly used, even on the stage. \\\\n \\\\n The postures of the trunk might also be enumerated, \\\\n and be subjected to the rules of notation ; but this would \\\\n be unnecessary, as they are in general sufficiently un- \\\\n derstood, being the accompaniment of the motions of \\\\n the head, the arms and the hands. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER VII. \\\\n \\\\n THE STROKE AND TIME OF GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n The arm, the fore-arm, the hand, and the fingers, \\\\n form the grand instrument of gesture, or, as Cicero \\\\n calls it, \" the weapon of the orator.\" The centre of \\\\n motion of this compound instrument, is the shoulder. \\\\n These parts do not move together in the manner of an \\\\n inflexible line ; but each separate joint often becomes \\\\n a new centre of motion for the portion between it and \\\\n the extremity. \\\\n \\\\n In gesticulating, this complex instrument does not \\\\n continue long in one direct line, nor in any particulai \\\\n \\\\n * Queen, Alas ! how is \\\\\\'t with you, \\\\n \\\\n That you do bend 3 r our eye on vacancy, \\\\n \\\\n And with the incorporeal air do hold discourse 1— Hamlet. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 106 (#116) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n106 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n flexure, but changes every moment the angles formed \\\\n at the different joints, which adds grace and variety to \\\\n the motions. The farther any portion of this complex \\\\n line is from the centre of motion, the greater space does \\\\n it pass through. The least motion, therefore, is that \\\\n made by the upper arm, and the greatest, that made \\\\n by the hand : from this circumstance alone, the ges- \\\\n tures of the latter are conspicuous. In gesticulating, \\\\n the hand has not only the advantage of being placed at \\\\n the extremity of the line farthest from the centre of \\\\n motion ; but, by means of the joint at the wrist, it can \\\\n spring with increased velocity on approaching the point \\\\n to which its gesture is directed. This action of the \\\\n hand is termed the stroke of the gesture ; and it should \\\\n be marked by different degrees of force, according to \\\\n the energy of the sentiment. In high passion, it should \\\\n be distinguished by a strong percussion; and in the \\\\n more moderate state of the speaker\\\\\\'s feelings, merely \\\\n by a turn of the hand, by a change of posture, or ele- \\\\n vation of the arm, or by a momentary arrest of the \\\\n motion of the gesture in its transitions. \\\\n \\\\n The stroke of the gesture is analogous to the empha- \\\\n sis of the voice ; and they should both fall exactly on \\\\n the accented syllable of the emphatic word. In this \\\\n way the emphatic force of the voice, and the stroke of \\\\n the gesture, co-operate in presenting the idea in the \\\\n most lively manner, to the eye as well as to the ear. \\\\n \\\\n There are other points of analogy between the voice \\\\n and gesture, which deserve consideration. In the sim- \\\\n ple and narrative parts of a discourse, there is little \\\\n effort or variety of expression, in the voice. Under \\\\n the same circumstances, the gesture, if any is used, \\\\n should be tame and simple ; but, in the more impas- \\\\n sioned parts, both should be equally exerted. The \\\\n gesture, also, in many instances, nearly imitates the \\\\n manner of the inflections of the voice. When the voice \\\\n rises, the gesture naturally ascends; and .when the \\\\n voice makes the falling inflection, or lowers its pitch, \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 107 (#117) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE 107 \\\\n \\\\n the gesture follows it by a corresponding descent ; and, \\\\n in the level and monotonous pronunciation of the voice, \\\\n the gesture seems to observe a similar limitation, by \\\\n moving rather in the horizontal direction, without much \\\\n varying its elevation. \\\\n \\\\n Some writers say, that, \" in calm discourse, the \\\\n words and the gestures should generally accompany \\\\n each other; but, in impassioned discourse, the feelings \\\\n of the speaker should first be manifested in the eyes ; \\\\n then, by the countenance ; next, by the gesture ; and, \\\\n lastly, by the words.\" This is not just. In all dis- \\\\n course, whether calm or impassioned, the words and \\\\n the gestures should accompany each other. As, in \\\\n beating time in music, the beat is made on the accented \\\\n part of the measure, so in speaking, the stroke of the \\\\n gesture should fall on the accented syllable of the em- \\\\n phatic word. The emotion which calls forth the word, \\\\n at the same moment, prompts the gesture. Hence, the \\\\n muscles of gesticulation should move synchronously \\\\n and harmoniously with those of the voice. When ges- \\\\n ture is not marked by the precision of the stroke, in \\\\n the proper places, it is very offensive. The arms, like \\\\n those of a person groping in the dark, seem to wander \\\\n about in quest of some uncertain object ; and the ac- \\\\n tion is of that faulty kind which is called sawing the \\\\n air. Even graceful motions, unmarked by the pre- \\\\n cision of the stroke of the gesture, as sometimes seen, \\\\n particularly among singers on the stage, lose much of \\\\n their force, and very soon cease to afford pleasure. \\\\n All the unmeaning motions of public speakers are at- \\\\n tended with the same ill effect as a mouthing and cant- \\\\n ting tone of declamation, which lays no emphasis with \\\\n just discrimination, but swells and falls with a vain \\\\n affectation of feeling, and with absolute deficiency both \\\\n m taste and judgment. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 108 (#118) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n.08 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER VIII. \\\\n \\\\n THE CLASSIFICATION OF GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n The arms, as well as the hands, may be employed, \\\\n in gesticulation, separately, or together, each using \\\\n similar, or dissimilar actions. Each arm may perforin \\\\n \\\\n stg* similar gestures when \\\\n Mar the body of the speaker \\\\n is presented towards \\\\n the person addressed \\\\n precisely in front (Fig. \\\\n 92); but when the \\\\n body is not so pre- \\\\n sented, the gestures \\\\n will not be similar \\\\n (Fig. 93) ; and, as such \\\\n posture and gestures \\\\n are not graceful, they \\\\n are not frequently \\\\n used. \\\\n \\\\n The advancement of one hand before the other is \\\\n an indication of precedence, as is, also, in general, its \\\\n higher elevation. The advanced hand, therefore, is \\\\n said to perform the principal gesture. In general, trgj \\\\n elevation of the retired arm is a whole position lower \\\\n than that of the advanced arm ; and, though the ges- \\\\n ture of the retired hand occasionally resembles that of \\\\n the advanced hand, yet its action is performed with \\\\n less energy and authority. For these reasons, the ac- \\\\n tion of the retired hand is called the subordinate ges- \\\\n ture. \\\\n \\\\n There is aclass of gestures called significant gestures :* \\\\n \\\\n * As this word has long been applied to a certain class of ges- \\\\n tures, and as there is some difficulty in procuring a better, I have \\\\n followed my predecessors in its use. The objection to the word is \\\\n obvious — it conveys the idea that all the gestures which do not \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 109 (#119) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 109 \\\\n \\\\n the extending of the index-finger towards persons, or \\\\n things, points them out ; the laying of the hand on the \\\\n breast refers to the feelings of the speaker; the placing \\\\n of the finger on the lips signifies an injunction of si- \\\\n lence. &c. \\\\n \\\\n But gestures, in general, are too vague to be com- \\\\n prehended under this description : they denote a sort \\\\n of general relation in the expressions — their power to \\\\n do this is derived from the time and manner of their \\\\n application, from the place in which they are used, and \\\\n from their various combinations. Some are used at \\\\n the beginning of a sentence, merely to indicate a com- \\\\n mencement in action, as well as speech; some are used \\\\n for description ; some, for explaining, extending, or \\\\n limiting; and some, for enforcing the predominant idea; \\\\n some, for keeping the audience in suspense, till the \\\\n more decisive gestures ; and some, for marking the ter- \\\\n mination of the sense, and the final result of the reason- \\\\n ing. These various gestures may be divided into five \\\\n classes : \\\\n \\\\n 1. Commencing gestures. 4. Suspending gestures. \\\\n \\\\n 2. Discriminating gestures. 5. Emphatic gestures. \\\\n .3. x\\\\\\\\uxiliary gestures. \\\\n \\\\n 1. Commencing gestures are made simply by raising \\\\n the hand from rest; and that, in general, not higher \\\\n than the horizontal position. They are used at the \\\\n beginning, and at the divisions of a discourse. \\\\n \\\\n 2. Discriminating gestures comprehend all those ges- \\\\n tures which serve to indicate persons and objects, as \\\\n well as those which are used for explaining, extending, \\\\n limiting, or modifying the predominant idea, and those \\\\n which are employed in question and answer, when \\\\n made without vehemence. They are performed in the \\\\n intermediate degrees of the range of the gesture, with \\\\n \\\\n fall into the class of which this is the distinctive name, are insigni* \\\\n Jicant, or unmeaning; a conclusion by no means correct. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 110 (#120) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n110 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n model ate force, and at small intervals. In colloquial \\\\n intercourse they are frequently confined to the motions \\\\n of the head. \\\\n \\\\n 3. Auxiliary, or alternate gestures, serve to aid, or \\\\n enforce the gesture of the advanced hand. They are \\\\n performed as follows : after the advanced hand has \\\\n made its gesture on the emphatic word, instead of pass- \\\\n ing to another gesture, on the next emphatic word, it \\\\n remains in the attitude of the last stroke till the retired \\\\n hand is brought up in aid of it, either by a similar ges- \\\\n ture, or by a more decisive one. In this way, variety \\\\n and extraordinary energy are given, at once, to pas- \\\\n sages which admit of such gestures. Of course, these \\\\n gestures are used with great advantage in high passion; \\\\n they are also frequently employed in description, where \\\\n they are executed more tamely. \\\\n \\\\n 4. Suspending, or preparatory gestures, are so called \\\\n because they hold the audience in suspense, by the \\\\n elevation or contraction of the arm, preparatory to the \\\\n stroke which is to fall on the emphatic word. \\\\n \\\\n 5. Emphatic gestures mark, with force, words op- \\\\n posed to, or compared with, each other; and, more par- \\\\n ticularly, the word which expresses the predominant \\\\n idea. Their stroke is generally arrested on the hori- \\\\n zontal elevation. Sometimes, however, emphatic ges- \\\\n tures are directed to the highest point in their range ; \\\\n at other times, to the lowest. When they are directed \\\\n to a high point, they often serve as suspending, or pre \\\\n paratory gestures, to the next emphatic gesture ; and, \\\\n when made at the close of a sentence, they serve a; \\\\n terminating gestures ; because, when the last important \\\\n idea is marked, no other gesture should be added, to \\\\n weaken its effect ; the arm should then fall to rest. \\\\n \\\\n As a sentence is an epitome of a complete composi- \\\\n tion, having a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion, \\\\n among single sentences illustrations of these different \\\\n gestures may be found. In the following sentence the \\\\n gestures for the righrhand, only? are noted. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 111 (#121) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE.

They are, as it were, \\\\n the elements of gesture, which, by their combinations, \\\\n produce its whole power of language and expression. \\\\n These elements are the component parts of every style \\\\n of delivery, whether tame or vehement, argumentative \\\\n or diffuse, ardent or indifferent, cold or pathetic. \\\\n \\\\n It has been observed that the principal gesture is performed by \\\\n the advanced hand, and the subordinate gesture by the retired hand. \\\\n The best modern speakers use either the right, or the left hand, in- \\\\n discriminately, for the principal gesture, as occasion may require. \\\\n As this practice is altogether at variance with the opinions and \\\\n rules of the ancient critics and rhetoricians, it may be proper to in- \\\\n quire how far we are justifiable in our departure from their great \\\\n authority. \\\\n \\\\n \"The left hand,\" says Quintilian, \"can never, with propriety, \\\\n perform gesture alone ; but it frequently acts in support of the right \\\\n hand.\" The consideration of the dress of the \\\\n ancients, which differed so essentially from that \\\\n of the moderns, may be sufficient to account for \\\\n the difference between their customs and ours. \\\\n The form of the ancient dress obliged the speaker, \\\\n if not totally to disuse his left hand, at least to \\\\n restrain its action very considerably. (See Fig. \\\\n 94.) The occasions on which the left hand may \\\\n perform the principal gesture, are the following : \\\\n 1. When the persons addressed are on the left \\\\n side, the left hand naturally performs the prin- \\\\n cipal gesture, in order to avoid the awkward- \\\\n ness of gesticulating across the body. 2. The \\\\n necessary discrimination of objects opposed to \\\\n erch other, requires the left hand alternately to \\\\n perform the principal gesture. 3. The advan- \\\\n tage of variety. 4. The power of giving, not \\\\n only. variety, but force, by occasionally elevating the retired hand, \\\\n and bestowing upon it all the spirit and authority of the gesture. \\\\n \\\\n But it is not only in the use of the left hand that modern speakers \\\\n differ from the ancients: they constantly violate another precept \\\\n enjoined by Quintilian and his followers, viz., that of speaking with \\\\n \\\\n .ique position ; x, extended position ; veq, hands vertical, arms \\\\n elevated oblique; a, ascending; br, breast — the right hand is laid \\\\n on the breast; Bnef, both hands natural, the arms elevated for \\\\n wards; Bshf sh, both hands supine, arms horizontal forwards shak- \\\\n ing; R, rest, the hands fall to rest. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 113 (#123) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 113 \\\\n \\\\n the corresponding- hand and foot advanced.* And yet, if the natural \\\\n emotions afford any just foundation for the manner of gesture, we \\\\n shall be inclined to give the preference to modern custom. Those \\\\n passions which incline us to advance towards their object, as love, \\\\n desire, anger, and revenge, naturally cause the corresponding hand \\\\n and foot to advance together with the head and body ; for, in this \\\\n way, the nearest approach is made to the object. And when pas- \\\\n sions of a contrary nature, as aversion and terror, affect us, still the \\\\n corresponding hand and foot are advanced; as if the better to guard \\\\n the body and head, which are thrown back. In such cases, it would \\\\n produce unnatural distortion to advance the contrary hand and foot. \\\\n Under tranquil circumstances, as when the speaker delivers narra- \\\\n tive, or reasons calmly, the contrary hand and footf may advance \\\\n together with grace and propriety. Indeed, perhaps such posture \\\\n is preferable, as it p^sents the body more exactly in front towards \\\\n the persons addressed. It was, probably, such circumstances alone, \\\\n which Quintilian had in view when he pronounced his opinion, that \\\\n it is unbecoming to stand with the corresponding hand and foot ad- \\\\n vanced. This explanation will serve to reconcile the apparent \\\\n deviation of the moderns from the ancient practice. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER IX. \\\\n \\\\n THE PREPARATION, TRANSITION, AND ACCOMPANIMENT OP \\\\n GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n In the transitions of gesture, the hand and arm should \\\\n not, in general, be precipitated to the intended position \\\\n by the shortest course ; but, in the calmer parts of the \\\\n oration, they should move in a sort of waving line, or \\\\n in one returning upon itself, somewhat in the manner \\\\n represented by the following diagram : \\\\n \\\\n Diag. 18. \\\\n \\\\n Let f represent tho position of the arm and hand for \\\\n wards, and let the place of the next gesture be q (ob* \\\\n \\\\n * Right hand and right foot ; or left hand and left foot. \\\\n \\\\n i The right hand and left foot ; or the left hand and right foot. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 114 (#124) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n114 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n Jique), and of a third be x (extended). The hand should \\\\n not move in the line of dots directly from/ to q, and \\\\n from q to x ; bat from / go back almost to c (across), \\\\n in order that it may traverse the greater space; and \\\\n then proceed to q with an accelerated motion for the \\\\n stroke of the gesture. In the same manner, and for the \\\\n same purpose, it should return back almost tof, before \\\\n t proceeds to x. \\\\n The ascending and descending gestures are performed \\\\n \\\\n Diag. 19. \\\\n \\\\n in the same manner, under simi \\\\n lar circumstances, as may be \\\\n seen in diagram 19, in which Z \\\\n is the zenith, and R the point of \\\\n rest, and where the hand, in \\\\n ascending and descending, is re- \\\\n presented as making returning \\\\n inflections at the principal points, \\\\n d, h, and e. \\\\n \\\\n The line of preparation as- \\\\n sumes a variety of other curves, \\\\n fourteen of which are repre- \\\\n sented by Diagram 20. \\\\n \\\\n Whatever form this indirect \\\\n line may be, it is used as a pre- \\\\n paration for the gesture to which \\\\n it leads; and the extent of the \\\\n return, or depth of the sweep or \\\\n -^Z^^ indentation, is determined by \\\\n \\\\n the character of the sentiments to be delivered. The \\\\n more magnificent they are, the greater is this parade ; \\\\n and the nearer to ordinary discourse, the less it is. \\\\n The preparation made by these different curves does \\\\n not suit every species of gesture ; it is adapted almost \\\\n solely to that kind which is termed discriminating \\\\n Another kind of preparation is made for emphatic ges- \\\\n tures. They are generally preceded by a suspending \\\\n gesture, which serves the double purpose of marking \\\\n some less important word, and of preparing for the \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 115 (#125) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE \\\\n \\\\n 115 \\\\n \\\\n stroke of the emphatic gesture. It will be recollected \\\\n that contracting and retracting gestures are reckoned \\\\n amongthesus- JW. 20. \\\\n \\\\n pending ges- \\\\n tures, as be- \\\\n ing made pre- \\\\n vious to some \\\\n forcib^a ef- \\\\n fort, and are, \\\\n therefore, pre- \\\\n paratory to \\\\n the gestures \\\\n which ensue. \\\\n In order to il- \\\\n lustrate what \\\\n is here ad- \\\\n vanced, let it \\\\n be supposed \\\\n that the em- \\\\n phatic ges- \\\\n ture requires \\\\n a strong per- \\\\n cussion of the arm descending forwards, as shfst — - \\\\n the preparation for this is the suspending, or prepare \\\\n tory gesture nefbn — , as in the following example: \\\\n \\\\n Shakspeare. \\\\n \\\\n An example of a preparatory contracting gesture : \\\\n \\\\n vhfrt — vhf rj — \\\\n \\\\n I hate the drum\\\\\\'s discordant sound. f — Langhorne. \\\\n \\\\n A gesture across, which passes rapidly to the ex \\\\n tended position, may also be used as a preparation foi \\\\n rejection : \\\\n \\\\n * The letters, nefbn, signify, natural elevated forwards bending \\\\n shfst, supine horizontal forwards striking. \\\\n \\\\n ■J- The letters, vhfrt, signify, vertical horizontal forward retract \\\\n ing; vhfrj, vertical horizontal forwards rejecting. \\\\n \\\\n nefbn— \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n shf st — \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Hear \\\\n \\\\n me \\\\n \\\\n for \\\\n \\\\n my \\\\n \\\\n cause \\\\n \\\\n # \\\\n \\\\n susp. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n emph. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 116 (#126) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n1 J 6 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n ohc z rj \\\\n \\\\n Who\\\\\\'s here so base that would be a bondman?* — Shaks. \\\\n Another example of a previous contracted gesture: \\\\n \\\\n Bvhfrt \\\\n \\\\n To hear the roar she sends through ail her gates. — Cowp. \\\\n \\\\n Tn the passage from Cowper, the suspending, or previous gesture, \\\\n Bvhfrj, contains all the letters belonging to the subsequent em- \\\\n phatic gesture, except the last (p). This new letter, only, is ex- \\\\n pressed, and is joined by a long dash, or mark of connexion, with \\\\n the notation letters of the preceding gesture : another line of con- \\\\n nexion, joining this letter to x, signifies that both hands continuing \\\\n in the same position, viz. vertical, the arms are to be extended. The \\\\n gestures, marked at large on this line, would be as follows: \\\\n \\\\n Bvlif rt Bvhff ■ Bvhx \\\\n \\\\n To hear the roar she sends through all her gates.j\" \\\\n \\\\n But the former method is preferable, as it abridges the trouble ol \\\\n notation, and is equally intelligible. \\\\n \\\\n The connexion of gesture is, therefore, the relation \\\\n which one gesture bears to another ; and it is shown \\\\n by the notation of the circumstances in which they \\\\n agree, and of those in which they differ. Thus, the \\\\n gestures noted in the foregoing line agree, first, in \\\\n being common to both hands (B), and then in the posi- \\\\n tion of each hand, v {vertical), and also in the elevation \\\\n of both arms, h (horizontal). So that it is unnecessary \\\\n to repeat those circumstances in which they agree, as \\\\n the connecting-dash expresses them with sufficient \\\\n clearness, and with greater brevity. \\\\n \\\\n The connexion of gesture in the vertical direction, \\\\n when the hand, without altering its posture, merely \\\\n ascends by short intervals, in order to mark a succes- \\\\n sion of discriminating gestures, is noted by the usual \\\\n connecting-dash, and an a over the word where the \\\\n hand ascends. \\\\n \\\\n * The letters, ohc, signify, the hand outwards, the arm hori \\\\n 2ontal across; x rj, extended rejecting. \\\\n \\\\n f Bvhfrt, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal forwards re- \\\\n tracting ; Bvhfp, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal forward* \\\\n pushing ; Bvhx, both hands vertical, both arms horizontal extended. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 117 (#127) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 117 \\\\n \\\\n phf- \\\\n \\\\n I mourn the pride \\\\n \\\\n •me/ — shfst — \\\\n \\\\n And avarice that make man a wolf to man. — Coivper. \\\\n \\\\n But this passage would perhaps answer better with \\\\n he auxiliary gesture, thus : \\\\n \\\\n Bphfa vef — \\\\n \\\\n I mourn the pride \\\\n \\\\n — vef Bnef bn — Bs/ifst R \\\\n \\\\n And avarice that make man a wolf to man.* \\\\n \\\\n The transition of gesture relates to the manner of \\\\n arriving at a gesture, and to the changes of gesture ; \\\\n and signifies either the particular changes of the posi- \\\\n tion of the hand and arm, or the general change of the \\\\n principal gesture from one hand to the other. \\\\n \\\\n A gesture may have a very different character and \\\\n effect, according to the manner in which the hand ar- \\\\n rives at its destined point. It may ascend, descend, \\\\n move towards the right, or towards the left, and may \\\\n also make the stroke with various degrees of energy, \\\\n and in various ways ; and these motions constitute, in \\\\n each, an absolutely different gesture, though, after the \\\\n moment of the stroke, which a painter might choose to \\\\n represent, the hand and arm of each should be in the \\\\n same precise position. (Fig. 85, p. 100.) As, however, \\\\n the emphatic gestures are liable to ambiguity, on ac- \\\\n count of the various transitions which might be sup- \\\\n posed to bring them to their stroke, painters more fre- \\\\n quently choose to represent the suspending gestures, \\\\n which give an idea of action, and greater interest to \\\\n their principal figures. \\\\n \\\\n But the transition of gesture particularly relates to \\\\n the change of the principal gesture from one hand to \\\\n \\\\n * Bphfa, both hands prone horizontal forwards ascending 1 , \\\\n vef (followed by a dash), right hand vertical elevated forwards ; \\\\n vef (preceded by a dash), left hand vertical elevated forwards; \\\\n Bnefbn, both hands natural elevated forwards bending; Bsltf st, \\\\n both hands supine horizontal forwards striking. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 118 (#128) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n118 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n the other , which may be regulated, in some measure, \\\\n according to the following principles. So long as there \\\\n subsists a strict connexion between the sentiments, un- \\\\n interrupted by any considerable pause, or change of \\\\n persons, no transition can take place in this last sense : \\\\n the same hand which began, continues to perform the \\\\n principal gesture. And the variety which it is always \\\\n desirable to produce, must not be attempted by the \\\\n change of the principal gesture : it must arise alone \\\\n from the graceful and well-regulated action of the ad- \\\\n vanced hand, supported by the combined assistance or \\\\n accompaniment of the other. If the passage to be pro- \\\\n nounced be of considerable length, the right hand should \\\\n perform the principal gesture throughout the whole of \\\\n it. For the left, though allowed to take its place oc- \\\\n casionally, according to certain rules, by no means \\\\n arrives at an equality of honour. The right hand \\\\n always continues the better hand, both from long pre- \\\\n scription, and the ability arising from use. \\\\n \\\\n In the narrative parts of an oration, where different \\\\n persons or things are to be described as variously dis- \\\\n posed, or in the recitation of descriptive poetry, when \\\\n a picture, as it were, is to be represented by the speaker, \\\\n consisting of many natural objects in different parts of \\\\n a landscape, of which Gray\\\\\\'s Elegy in a Country \\\\n Church-yard will afford many examples, the right hand \\\\n having first pointed out those persons or objects sup- \\\\n posed to lie adjacent to itself, may yield to the left the \\\\n arrangement and ordering of those other parts, which \\\\n may be imagined to be at its own side. This inter- \\\\n change, judiciously regulated, produces a pleasing va- \\\\n riety in the gesture ; and if the speaker possess the \\\\n imagination of a painter, his disposition and colouring \\\\n will produce the most distinct and vivid picture. \\\\n \\\\n Variety, which is a most important object to be kept \\\\n in view by a public speaker, allows, with advantage, \\\\n an interchange of the principal gesture, even when the \\\\n subject may be of a more abstruse and demonstrative \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 119 (#129) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 119 \\\\n \\\\n nature. When there is any opposition, or antithesis, \\\\n among the ideas, or even in the structure of sentences, \\\\n or where a new argument is introduced, after the dis- \\\\n cussion of a former is ended, as at. a new division, or a \\\\n new paragraph, there may be a change of the principal \\\\n gesture. But it will be a point of judgment and taste \\\\n in the speaker not to carry this balancing, or alterna- \\\\n tion of gesture, to an affected extreme, and not, even in \\\\n allowable cases, to indulge in it overmuch ; nor will he \\\\n prolong too far the principal action permitted to the \\\\n left hand, which he will always remember is the weaker, \\\\n and admitted into the foremost place rather by courtesy \\\\n than of right ; and which he will, therefore, restrict \\\\n with discretion in the exercise of this occasional dis- \\\\n tinction. \\\\n \\\\n In the changes made from one hand to the other, the \\\\n transition should be managed with ease and simplicity. \\\\n As soon as the advanced hand has made the stroke of \\\\n its last, emphatic gesture, it should fall quietly to rest, \\\\n whilst, at the same time, the hand w r hich is, in its turn, \\\\n to assume the principal action, commences its prepara- \\\\n tion for the ensuing gesture. It will be observed that \\\\n a commencing, or discriminating gesture, should be \\\\n gentle, as a modest beginning suits its first entrance \\\\n into authority. An emphatic gesture immediately after \\\\n one from the other hand, would be violent and out- \\\\n rageous ; something like the gesticulations of those \\\\n little wooden figures set up to frighten birds from corn, \\\\n or fruit, which have the arms fixed on an axis in such \\\\n a manner that they are alternately raised and depressed \\\\n with equal vehemence, according as they are blown \\\\n about by the wind. \\\\n \\\\n When the orator finds it necessary to change the \\\\n position of the feet, so as to advance that which was \\\\n before retired, the general rule is that he should effect \\\\n it imperceptibly, and not commence the change till \\\\n after the hand has begun its change of action. Some \\\\n times, however, in vehement passages, the oratoi is \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 120 (#130) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n1^0 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n allowed, by the highest authority, to advance suddenly \\\\n and even to stamp. \\\\n \\\\n The subordinate gesture, already mentioned, as performed by the \\\\n retired hand, will be found to bear a ciose analogy to accompani- \\\\n ment in music. A little observation will suffice for acquiring a \\\\n general knowledge of the accompaniment of gesture ; and after \\\\n attentively practising ibr some time, the inferior hand will as easily \\\\n fall into a suitable accompaniment of the principal gesture, as the \\\\n left hand of a performer on a keyed instrument, will strike correctly \\\\n the fundamental bass. \\\\n \\\\n The general rule for accompaniment of gesture, in \\\\n calm and moderate speaking, when both hands do not \\\\n perform the same gesture, is that the retired arm should \\\\n be about one interval less raised than the advanced \\\\n arm, and that in the transverse position it should be \\\\n distant from it about two intervals, or a right angle. \\\\n Hence, if the right hand should perform the principal \\\\n gesture, and this gesture should be supine elevated for- \\\\n wards, the accompaniment would be expressed in the \\\\n \\\\n second set of letters, for the left hand, thus : -J-. , \\\\n \\\\n prm. ac. \\\\n \\\\n (Fig. 38) ; and again, vh f~~~ P dx , (Fig. 33). When the \\\\n prin. ac. \\\\n \\\\n force of the expression is strong, the accompanying \\\\n hand is equally elevated with the principal. In this \\\\n degree of force, the gestures are thus : vhf — vhx. \\\\n These circumstances afford convenient opportunities \\\\n for abridging the notation. When both hands perform \\\\n the same, or nearly the same gesture, a capital B pre- \\\\n ceding one set of letters suffices for both hands, as Bvhf \\\\n And when the accompanying gesture follows the gene- \\\\n ral rule, and has nothing remarkable distinguishing it, \\\\n the gesture of the principal hand only need be noted ; \\\\n the accompaniment is easily understood, and will fol- \\\\n low of course to the well-practised speaker. \\\\n \\\\n But besides the motions of the subordinate gesture, \\\\n other very important accompaniments are to be at- \\\\n tended to; as those of the lower limbs, of the body, \\\\n und of the head : otherwise the performance will bo \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 121 (#131) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE \\\\n \\\\n 121 \\\\n \\\\n rigid and absurd, like that of a puppet. Indeed, not \\\\n only those more prominent and distinguished parts \\\\n must accompany the voice and principal action of the \\\\n speaker, but every muscle of the body, and every ex- \\\\n pression of the countenance, must, join in harmony with \\\\n those gestures, in order to impress upon them the cha- \\\\n racter of nature and truth. There is no gesture, or \\\\n change of gesture, which is not meant to enforce or to \\\\n illustrate some new circumstance, which either cails \\\\n into action muscles before at rest, or into a change of \\\\n action those already in exertion. And this impression \\\\n and influence extend not only to those muscles which \\\\n are most strong and distinguished, but even to the most \\\\n delicate fibres of the human frame, such as those which \\\\n adjust the expression of the mouth, of the nostrils, of \\\\n the brows, and of that wonderful organ the eye. \\\\n \\\\n An example may here be given of some of the stronger \\\\n changes of the head, body, and lower limbs, which ac- \\\\n company certain principal gestures. If the right hand \\\\n be forcibly withdrawn, and presented vhfc (vertical \\\\n horizontal forwards contracted), the left vdqc (vertical \\\\n dowmwards oblique contracted), the \\\\n feet will naturally retire, and be \\\\n rRlx (retire to the first position \\\\n extended of the right foot). The \\\\n body, at the same time, will be \\\\n thrown backwards, whilst the whole \\\\n countenance will express aversion, \\\\n or horror. (Fig. 95). \\\\n \\\\n The gesture of the right, phf ad, \\\\n will be accompanied and noted thus : \\\\n \\\\n p /LJ. — — L_L which signifies that \\\\n aR2 ° \\\\n \\\\n the head, and consequently the body, \\\\n \\\\n leans forwards, and that the eyes are turned earnestly \\\\n \\\\n in the same direction. This evident desire of inspect \\\\n \\\\n ing the object more nearly, is also accompanied by an \\\\n \\\\n advanced step of the right foot, the principal gesture \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 122 (#132) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n122 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION \\\\n \\\\n bemg performed by the right hand. As the gesture \\\\n of the left hand could hardly be avoided, under the \\\\n circumstances mentioned, the notation of it might have \\\\n been omitted. \\\\n \\\\n It will be observed, that if the hand, in its gestures, \\\\n \\\\n at any time \\\\n approach \\\\n the head, \\\\n the head \\\\n bends to- \\\\n wards the \\\\n hand ; and \\\\n if the hand \\\\n presents its \\\\n palm, and \\\\n pushes, as it \\\\n were, an ob- \\\\n ject away \\\\n in disgust, \\\\n \\\\n the head accompanies the action, not only by retiring \\\\n back, but by averting the face. And the motions ex- \\\\n pressing this aversion are ; first, the eye, directed to- \\\\n wards the object ; the approaching of the back of the \\\\n hand towards the face, and the head bending towards \\\\n the hand, and then the pushing forwards of the palm \\\\n of the hand, and the throwing back of the head, and \\\\n averting the face at the same time. The notation will \\\\n \\\\n stand thus : F vh f c ~~, (Fig. 96), and then, A vk 9 P ~~ \\\\n aR2 rRlx \\\\n \\\\n (Fig. 07). \\\\n \\\\n After the stroke of the emphatic gesture, if the \\\\n speaker has completely closed his remarks on a par- \\\\n ticular part of his subject, or if he has finished his ora- \\\\n tion, both hands should fall to rest, in a manner suiting \\\\n the last expressions which he has delivered. This \\\\n falling of the hand to rest is named the close and ter- \\\\n mination of gesture. It is contrary to the correct sim- \\\\n plicity of gesture to mark a single word or idea with \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 123 (#133) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 123 \\\\n \\\\n more than one emphatic stroke ; any appendix of ges- \\\\n ture, after this, would only weaken its force, or render \\\\n it ridiculous. \\\\n \\\\n The termination of gesture, or rather, the emphatic \\\\n gesture which terminates, should not be made across. \\\\n It is generally made about the horizontal elevation, but \\\\n sometimes it is made downwards, or elevated, according \\\\n to the sentiment. The horizontal termination suits \\\\n decision and instruction ; the downward, disapproba- \\\\n tion and condemnation ; the elevated, pride, high pas- \\\\n sion and devotion. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER X. \\\\n \\\\n THE FREQUENCY, MODERATION, AND INTERMISSION OP \\\\n GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n As gesture is used for the illustration or enforce- \\\\n ment of language, it should be limited, in its applica- \\\\n tion, to such words and passages only as admit, or \\\\n rather require, such illustration or enforcement. That \\\\n is, gesture should not be used by a public speaker on \\\\n every word where it is possible to apply it without \\\\n manifest impropriety ; but it should rather be reserved \\\\n for such passages as require to be rendered more pro- \\\\n minent than the others, and to be more highly coloured. \\\\n A judicious speaker will therefore reserve his gesture, \\\\n at least the force and ornament of it, for those parts of \\\\n his discourse for which he also reserves the brilliancy \\\\n of language and thought. Sometimes, the absolute \\\\n intermission of gesture is advantageous, as in the com- \\\\n mencement or opening of arguments. When an argu- \\\\n ment is nearly concluded, moderate gesture will give \\\\n it more force, and relieve the monotony of a mere dry \\\\n demonstration, should the spirit of the composition \\\\n admit such addition. \\\\n \\\\n In all discourses, the frequency of gesture will be \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 124 (#134) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n124 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n determined, in general, by the number, the novelty, and \\\\n the discrimination of ideas. In every well-constructed \\\\n sentence, some new idea is advanced, which may be \\\\n marked by a suitable gesture; and possibly the various \\\\n limitations and modifications of it will also admit of a \\\\n similar distinction. Thus each separate clause, or \\\\n member of a sentence, may admit a distinct gesture on \\\\n the principal word: and as each epithet is a distinct \\\\n quality, added to the principal name, and as each ad- \\\\n verb has the same effect on the principal action ex- \\\\n pressed by the verb, a new gesture may be made on \\\\n each. But for this purpose, unless the word is empha- \\\\n tic, a turn of the hand, a small motion in the trans- \\\\n verse or vertical direction, or a slight inclination of the \\\\n head, is sufficient. \\\\n \\\\n In a sentence where every word is emphatic, each \\\\n may be marked with a gesture. Sentences of this kind \\\\n generally condense, in a small compass, valuable infor- \\\\n mation, and should therefore be strongly enforced and \\\\n marked with precision. They should, however, be \\\\n delivered distinctly and deliberately, or the gestures \\\\n will confuse the sentiment, and even cast a degree of \\\\n ridicule upon it, as may be found by pronouncing the \\\\n following serious observation with different degrees of \\\\n rapidity. \\\\n \\\\n shf — nef — sfrfst — \\\\n \\\\n JNJan is born to trouble. \\\\n \\\\n com. susp. emph. $ t-er. \\\\n \\\\n Neither the emphatic gesture, nor the force of the \\\\n voice, always falls on those words which are the prin- \\\\n cipal, in a grammatical sense — the nouns and verbs. \\\\n The gesture sometimes falls on the word which modi- \\\\n fies each — on the adjective, which expresses the \\\\n quality of the noun, or on the adverb, which has a \\\\n similar effect upon the action or assertion of the verb. \\\\n \\\\n The same notation, applied to a vehement passage \\\\n requires the arm to be raised higher than when it is \\\\n apolied to one of the contrary character. A judicious \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 125 (#135) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 125 \\\\n \\\\n speaker will often omit his gesture altogether, and use \\\\n it only when absolutely necessary to illustrate, or to \\\\n enforce his sentiments. Gesture may be said to hold \\\\n the place of high seasoning; it must, therefore, be \\\\n managed with discretion, lest it should defeat its own \\\\n purposes, and create disgust. If a speaker proves \\\\n truly eloquent, he is sure of the most liberal and solid \\\\n approbation. But he should not hazard too much ; he \\\\n should be guarded in the commencement of his dis- \\\\n course, and should restrain his gesture in the calm and \\\\n reasoning passages, reserving its force and brilliancy \\\\n for the appropriate expression of his most earnest feel- \\\\n ings and boldest thoughts. His transitions from the \\\\n narrative parts to those which are most highly wrought, \\\\n and which require his utmost exertions, should be gra- \\\\n dual and just, and free from extravagance. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER XL \\\\n \\\\n THE QUALITIES OF GESTURE, AND THE GESTURE SUITED \\\\n TO DIFFERENT MODES OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. \\\\n \\\\n The different qualities which constitute the perfec- \\\\n tion of gesture, and their opposite imperfections, are as \\\\n follows : \\\\n \\\\n 1. Magnificence. 5. Simplicity. \\\\n \\\\n 2. Boldness. 6. Grace. \\\\n \\\\n 3. Energy. 7. Propriety. \\\\n \\\\n 4. Variety. 8. Precision. \\\\n \\\\n 1. Magnificence of gesture. This is effected by de- \\\\n taching the elbow completely from the body, and \\\\n unfolding the whole oratorical weapon. In magnifi- \\\\n cent gesture, the action is flowing and unconstrained ; \\\\n the preparations are made in graceful curves ; the \\\\n transitions are easy, and the accompaniments, in all \\\\n respects, illustrative of the principal action. The mo- \\\\n 9 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 126 (#136) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n126 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n tions of the head are free, and the inflections of the \\\\n body manly and dignified. The action of the lower \\\\n limbs is decisive, and a considerable space is traversed \\\\n with firmness and with force. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfections are short and constrained \\\\n gestures, rigidity of the joints, and stiffness of the body, \\\\n with short steps, and doubtful or timid movements. \\\\n \\\\n 2. Boldness of gesture. This arises from that ele- \\\\n vated courage and self-confidence which ventures to \\\\n hazard any action, however unusual, which is produc- \\\\n tive of a grand or striking effect. In this sort of ges- \\\\n ture, unexpected positions, elevations and transitions, \\\\n surprise at once by their novelty and grace, and thus \\\\n illustrate or enforce the ideas of the speaker with irre- \\\\n sistible effect. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfection is tameness. \\\\n \\\\n 3. Energy of gesture. This consists in the firmness \\\\n and decision of the whole action ; and in the precision \\\\n of the stroke of the gesture, which aids the emphasis \\\\n of the voice. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfections are feebleness and inde- \\\\n cision. \\\\n \\\\n 4. Variety of gesture. This consists in the applica- \\\\n tion of different, but appropriate gestures, to the same, \\\\n or analogous sentiments, so as to avoid recurring too \\\\n frequently to one favourite gesture, or set of gestures. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfection is monotony of gesture, \\\\n analogous to that of the voice. \\\\n \\\\n 5. Simplicity of gesture. This is such a character \\\\n of gesture as appears the natural result of the situation \\\\n and sentiments ; which is neither carried beyond the \\\\n just extent of the feeling, through affectation of variety, \\\\n nor falls short of it through want of confidence. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfection is affectation. \\\\n \\\\n 6. Grace of gesture. This is the result of all other \\\\n perfections, arising from a dignified self-possession of \\\\n mind, and the power of personal exertion, practised \\\\n into facility after the best models, and according to \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 127 (#137) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 1^7 \\\\n \\\\n true taste. To the more particular investigation of \\\\n this quality a Chapter is devoted. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfection is awkwardness. \\\\n \\\\n 7. Propriety of gesture, called also truth of gesture, \\\\n or natural gesture. This consists in the judicious use \\\\n of gestures best suited to illustrate or to express the \\\\n sentiment. Propriety of gesture is generally founded \\\\n on some natural connexion between the sentiment and \\\\n the action. Significant gestures are strictly connected \\\\n with the sentiment. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfections are false, contradictory, \\\\n or unsuitable gestures. \\\\n \\\\n 8. Precision, or correctness of gesture. This arises \\\\n from the just preparation, the due force, and the cor- \\\\n rect timing of the action : when the preparation is nei- \\\\n ther too much abridged, nor too pompously displayed ; \\\\n when the stroke of the gesture is made with such a \\\\n degree of force as suits the character of the sentiment ; \\\\n and when it is correctly marked on the precise syllable \\\\n to be enforced. Precision of gesture gives the same \\\\n effect to action, as neatness of articulation gives to \\\\n speech. \\\\n \\\\n The opposite imperfections are the indecision, un- \\\\n certainty, and incorrectness arising from vague and \\\\n sawing gestures, which, far from illustrating, render \\\\n doubtful the sense of the sentiments which they accom- \\\\n pany, and distract the spectator. \\\\n \\\\n There are three general modes of public speaking, \\\\n each of which requires a different style of gesture; \\\\n namely, \\\\n \\\\n 1. The Epic. 3. The Colloquial. \\\\n \\\\n 2. The Rhetorical. \\\\n \\\\n 1. Epic gesture demands every natural and acquired \\\\n power, on the part of the speaker : to it belong Magni- \\\\n ficence, Boldness, Energy, Variety, Simplicity, Grace, \\\\n Propriety, and Precision. The compositions which \\\\n require epic gesture, in delivery, are tragedy, epic \\\\n poetry, lyric odes, and sublime description. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 128 (#138) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n1 28 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n 2. Rhetorical gesture requires, principally, Energy \\\\n Variety, Simplicity, and Precision. Grace is desirable , \\\\n Magnificence is rarely wanting, but may sometimes \\\\n lave place. Propriety, in a limited sense, should be \\\\n observed. Boldness is inadmissible ; because the ora- \\\\n tor is not, like the player, subjected to any unexpected \\\\n circumstances. He is not, therefore, at liberty to ex- \\\\n press surprise, or any other passion, by bold gestures \\\\n or attitudes. \\\\n \\\\n 3. Colloquial gesture, when concerned in the higher \\\\n scenes of polite life, requires, principally, Simplicity \\\\n and Grace ; Precision will follow of course ; it may oc- \\\\n casionally demand something of Energy and Variety \\\\n Magnificence and Boldness are inadmissible. \\\\n \\\\n The gesture of the public speaker must vary con- \\\\n siderably with the different circumstances of his situa- \\\\n tion, of his sentiments, and of his audience. If the \\\\n mere information or instruction of his audience be his \\\\n sole object, as when the evidences of religion and the \\\\n grounds of Christian duties are to be explained from \\\\n the pulpit, or w T hen the details of calculation and finance \\\\n are to be laid before Congress, or when facts are \\\\n weighed and laws are argued in the courts of justice, \\\\n his gestures should be of that class which is called dis- \\\\n criminating gestures. These he should exercise with \\\\n simplicity and precision. He should strip them of all \\\\n the parade of preparation, and of the graces of transi- \\\\n tion, and give them only that degree of variety which \\\\n shall guard them against disgusting sameness. This \\\\n is far removed from theatrical gesture ; it rather ap- \\\\n proaches the colloquial style. Nothing could be more \\\\n incongruous than for a public speaker, in either of the \\\\n foregoing situations, to introduce the parade and mag- \\\\n nificence of theatrical gesture. The charge which is \\\\n sometimes made against public speakers, of being thea- \\\\n trical in their gesture, probably arises more from some \\\\n unsuitableness in their manner to the matter, than from \\\\n any thing of uncommon majesty, boldness, or grace in \\\\n their action. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 129 (#139) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 129 \\\\n \\\\n When the public speaker aims at persuasion, as in \\\\n discourses from the pulpit for public charities, or on \\\\n extraordinary occasions in Congress, or at the bar, \\\\n when the advocate desires to influence the opinions of \\\\n a jury, he will naturally use more graceful, more flow- \\\\n ing, and more varied gesture. But he should not fail \\\\n into the action of the theatre. He may be graceful, \\\\n but he should be simple ; he may be energetic, but he \\\\n should not affect gestures too strongly significant, much \\\\n less attempt surprise by attitudes. All his gestures \\\\n should be regulated by manly decorum, suitable to his \\\\n situation, to the character of his hearers, and to the \\\\n just expression of his sentiments. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER XII. \\\\n \\\\n SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. \\\\n \\\\n The most important of the significant gestures are \\\\n the following : \\\\n \\\\n The Head and Face. \\\\n \\\\n The hanging down of the head denotes shame, or \\\\n grief. \\\\n \\\\n The holding of it up, pride or courage. \\\\n \\\\n To nod forwards implies assent. \\\\n \\\\n To toss the head back, dissent. \\\\n \\\\n The inclination of the head implies diffidence or lan- \\\\n guor. \\\\n \\\\n The head is averted, in dislike or horror. \\\\n \\\\n ft leans forward, in attention. \\\\n \\\\n The Eyes. \\\\n \\\\n The eyes are raised, in prayer. \\\\n \\\\n They weep, in sorrow. \\\\n \\\\n They burn, in anger. \\\\n \\\\n They are downcast -or averted, in shame or grief \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 130 (#140) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n130 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n They are cast on vacancy, in thought. \\\\n \\\\n They are cast in various directions, in doubt and \\\\n anxiety. \\\\n \\\\n The Arms. \\\\n \\\\n The placing of the hand on the head, indicates pain \\\\n or distress. \\\\n \\\\n On the eyes, shame or sorrow. \\\\n \\\\n On the lips, an injunction of silence. \\\\n \\\\n On the breast, an appeal to conscience. \\\\n \\\\n The hand is waved, or flourished, in joy or contempt \\\\n \\\\n Both hands are held supine, or they are applied, 01 \\\\n clasped, in prayer. \\\\n \\\\n Both are held prone, in blessing. \\\\n \\\\n They are clasped, or wrung, in affliction. \\\\n \\\\n They are held forward, and received, in friendship. \\\\n \\\\n The Body. \\\\n The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage. \\\\n Thrown back, pride. \\\\n \\\\n Stooping forward, condescension or compassion. \\\\n Bending, reverence or respect. \\\\n Prostration, the utmost humility or abasement. \\\\n \\\\n The Lower Limbs. \\\\n The firm position of the lower limbs signifies courage, \\\\n or obstinacy. \\\\n \\\\n Bended knees indicate timidity, or weakness. \\\\n \\\\n The lower limbs advance, in desire or courage. \\\\n \\\\n They retire, in aversion or fear. \\\\n \\\\n Start, in terror. \\\\n \\\\n Stamp, in authority or anger. \\\\n \\\\n Kneel, in submission and prayer. \\\\n \\\\n These are a few of the simple gestures which may \\\\n be termed significant. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 131 (#141) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n 131 \\\\n \\\\n COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. \\\\n \\\\n Complex Significant Gestures are employed chiefly in \\\\n dramatic representation. They are combinations of \\\\n simple significant gestures, variously associated accord- \\\\n ing to the mingled passions which they represent. The \\\\n boldest and most magnificent of them are termed atti- \\\\n tudes. The following are examples of complex signifi- \\\\n cant gestures : \\\\n \\\\n Reproach puts on a stern aspect : the brow is con- \\\\n tracted, the lip is turned up with scorn, and the whole \\\\n body is expressive of \\\\n aversion. Fig. 166 \\\\n represents Queen Ka- \\\\n tharine, in the trial \\\\n scene, in the play of \\\\n Henry VIII. reproach- \\\\n ing Wolsey for the in- \\\\n juries which had been \\\\n neaped upon her. \\\\n \\\\n Apprehension is the \\\\n prospect of future evil \\\\n accompanied with un- \\\\n easiness of mind. Fig. \\\\n 167 is a good example. \\\\n It represents Hamlet \\\\n \\\\n in the act of exclaiming, \"Ay, there\\\\\\'s the rub.\\\\\\' \\\\n Hamlet\\\\\\'s Soliloquy, p. 249.] \\\\n \\\\n Terror excites the person who suffers under it, to \\\\n avoid the dreaded object, or to escape from it. If it be \\\\n some dangerous reptile on the ground, and very neai, \\\\n the expression is represented by starting back and look- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 132 (#142) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n132 \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n ing downwards. If the danger threaten from a dis- \\\\n tance, the terror arising is expressed by looking for- \\\\n wards, and not starting back, but merely in the retired \\\\n position. But if the dread of impending death from \\\\n the hand of an enemy awaken this passion, the coward \\\\n flies. Of this there is a fine example in the battles of \\\\n \\\\n Alexander, by \\\\n LeBrun. Fig. \\\\n 168represents \\\\n terror as de- \\\\n scribed by En- \\\\n gel. It is that \\\\n of a man a- \\\\n 1 a.r m e d by \\\\n lightning and \\\\n thunder. He \\\\n shuts his eyes, \\\\n covers them \\\\n with one hand \\\\n and extends \\\\n \\\\n the other behind him, as if to ward off the dreaded stroke. \\\\n Aversion, as already observed, is expressed by two \\\\n gestures. (See p. 122.) \\\\n \\\\n Horror, which is aversion or astonishment mingled \\\\n with terror, is seldom capable of retreating, but remains \\\\n in one attitude, with the eyes riveted on the object, the \\\\n arms, with the hands vertical, held forward to guard \\\\n the person, and the whole frame trembling. (Fig. 169.) \\\\n Listening in order to obtain the surest and most va- \\\\n rious information, first casts the eye quickly in the ap- \\\\n parent direction of the sounds; if nothing is seen, the \\\\n ear is turned towards the point of expectation, the eye \\\\n is bent on vacancy, and the arm is extended, with the \\\\n hand vertical ; but all this passes in a moment. If the \\\\n sounds proceed from different points at the same time, \\\\n both hands are held up, and the face and eyes alternately \\\\n change from one side to the other with a rapidity go- \\\\n verned by the nature of the sound ; if it be alarming, with \\\\n \\\\n 0^*\" \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 133 (#143) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n 133 \\\\n \\\\n trepidation ; if pleasing, with gentle motion.

(Fig. 100.) In admiration arising \\\\n from some extraordinary or unexpected circumstances, \\\\n the hands are thrown up supine elevated, together with \\\\n the face and the eyes. , \\\\n \\\\n Veneration crosses both hands on the breast, casts \\\\n \\\\n down the eyes slow- \\\\n ly, and bows the \\\\n head, (Fig. 101.) \\\\n \\\\n Deprecation ad- \\\\n vances in the ex- \\\\n tended position of \\\\n the feet, approach- \\\\n ing to kneeling, \\\\n clasps the hands \\\\n forcibly together \\\\n throws back the \\\\n H head, sinking it be- \\\\n tween the shoui \\\\n tiers, and looks earnestly up to the person implored \\\\n (Fig. 102.) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 134 (#144) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n134 \\\\n \\\\n GESTURE \\\\n \\\\n In appealing to heaven, the right hand is laid on the \\\\n breast, then the left is projected su- \\\\n pine upwards ; the eyes are first di- \\\\n rected forwards, and then upwards. \\\\n (Fig. 103.) \\\\n \\\\n In the appeal to conscience, the \\\\n right hand is laid on the breast, the \\\\n left drops unmoved, the eyes are fixed \\\\n upon the person addressed (Fig. 80, p. \\\\n 99) ; sometimes both hands press the \\\\n breast. \\\\n \\\\n Shame in the extreme sinks on the \\\\n knee, and covers the eyes with both \\\\n hands. (Fig. 104.) This is a femi- \\\\n nine expression of it. \\\\n \\\\n Mild resignation falls on the knee, \\\\n crosses the arms on the breast, and looks forwards and \\\\n upwards towards heaven. (Fig. 105.) \\\\n \\\\n Resignation mixed with desperation, stands erect and \\\\n unmoved, the head thrown back, the eyes turned up- \\\\n ward, and fixed, the arms crossed. A fine instance is \\\\n seen in Fig. 108, from an attitude of Mrs. Siddons. \\\\n \\\\n Grief arising from sudden and afflicting intelligence, \\\\n covers the eyes with one hand, advances forwards, and \\\\n throws back tne other hand. (Fig. 107, and Fig. 81, p. 99.) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 135 (#145) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n 135 \\\\n \\\\n Attention demanding silence, holds the finger on the \\\\n lips, and leans forwards, sometimes repressing with the \\\\n left hand. (Fig. 82, p. 99.) \\\\n \\\\n Distress, when extreme, lays the palm of the hand \\\\n upon the forehead, throws back the head and body, \\\\n and retires with a long and sadden step. (Fig. 83. p. 99. \\\\n \\\\n Deliberation on ordinary subjects, holds the chin \\\\n and sets the arm a-kimbo. (Fig. 84, p. 99.) \\\\n \\\\n Self-sufficiency folds the arms, and sets himself on \\\\n his centre. (Fig. 48, p. 92.) This was a favourite \\\\n posture of Bonaparte. \\\\n \\\\n Pride throws back the body, and holds the head high. \\\\n \\\\n These few complex significant gestures are some of \\\\n the most obvious, and principally such as occurred in \\\\n the illustration of other parts of this system; they \\\\n serve, however, in some degree, to explain the nature \\\\n of these gestures. But among the writers who have \\\\n treated particularly of significant gestures, none have \\\\n written with greater ingenuity than Engel : we will \\\\n borrow, therefore, an example or two from him. \\\\n \\\\n Surprise causes the body and lower limbs to retire \\\\n and affection stimulates the person to advance. (Fig. \\\\n 108.) The figure represents Frederick de Reuss, in a \\\\n German play, who unexpectedly sees his dear friend. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 136 (#146) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n136 \\\\n \\\\n GESTURE. \\\\n \\\\n He withdraws, in surprise, his body and lower limbs, \\\\n Riid, in the ardour of friendship, immediately stretches \\\\n forwards his head and his arms. \\\\n \\\\n When the thoughts flow without \\\\n diilicuity or opposition, the move- \\\\n ment of the limbs is free and direct. \\\\n But when difficulties occur, or ob- \\\\n stacles are discovered, a man either \\\\n arrests his action entirely, or changes \\\\n it to something altogether different. \\\\n The direction of his eyes, and the(ggxi^ \\\\n action of his head, are also, under ^e*—=* \\\\n similar circumstances, quite altered. \\\\n The eyes, instead of moving freely \\\\n from object to object, become fixed, \\\\n and the head is thrown back, if be- \\\\n fore hanging down on the breast. As an example of \\\\n these effects, M. Engel refers to a scene in a play of \\\\n Lessing, in which an old gentleman is very much \\\\n puzzled how to ma- \\\\n nage, in a situa- \\\\n tion of great diffi- \\\\n culty and delicacy. \\\\n In the commence- \\\\n ment of his delibe- \\\\n rations he is repre- \\\\n sented as in Fig. i09, \\\\n and in the next pe- \\\\n riod of them, as in \\\\n Fig. 110. \\\\n \\\\n These examples \\\\n are introduced by \\\\n M. Engel to illus- \\\\n trate his analogous gestures, but they may also be \\\\n very well applied to illustrate the complex, significant \\\\n gestures, which are the present subject of investigation. \\\\n The description which he gives of melancholy, con- \\\\n trasted with anxiety, is, throughout, eorrect, and full \\\\n of nice discrimination. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 137 (#147) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nE L O C U T I N . \\\\n \\\\n 137 \\\\n \\\\n Melancholy is a feeble and passive affection ; it is \\\\n attended by a total relaxation of the muscles, with a \\\\n mute and tranquil resignation, un- \\\\n accompanied by opposition either \\\\n to the cause or the sensibility of \\\\n the evil. The character, externally, \\\\n is languor, without motion, the \\\\n head hanging at the \" side next, the \\\\n heart,\" the eyes turned upon its \\\\n object, or, if that is absent, fixed \\\\n upon the ground, the hands hang- \\\\n ing down by their own weight, \\\\n without effort, and joined loosely \\\\n together. (Fig. 111.) \\\\n \\\\n Anxiety is of a different charac- \\\\n ter; it is restless and active, and \\\\n manifest by the extension of the muscles ; the eye is \\\\n filled with fire, the breathing is quick, the motion is \\\\n hurried, the head is thrown back, the whole body is \\\\n extended. The sufferer is like a sick \\\\n man, who tosses incessantly, and finds \\\\n himself uneasy in every situation. (Fig. \\\\n 112.) \\\\n \\\\n One of the causes of M. Engel\\\\\\'s ges- \\\\n tures of analogy is, as he observes, the \\\\n \" disposition of the mind to refer intellec \\\\n tual ideas to external objects. When \\\\n king Lear recollects the barbarous treat- \\\\n ment of his daughters, who, in the midst \\\\n ?[IIL of a stormy night, had exposed his hoary \\\\n \" head to the inclemency of the weather ; \\\\n and when he immmediately exclaims \\\\n \\\\n O that way madness lies; \\\\n No more of that, \\\\n \\\\n let me shun that \\\\n \\\\n <here is not, in reality, any external object from which \\\\n this unhappy prince should avert his eyes with horror \\\\n and yet he turns his head away to the side opposite \\\\n that to which it was directed before, endeavouring, as \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 138 (#148) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n138 \\\\n \\\\n GESTURE \\\\n \\\\n it were, with his hand reversed, to banish that cru^l \\\\n \\\\n and afflicting recollection.\" (Fig. \\\\n 113.) \\\\n \\\\n The significant gestures, how- \\\\n ever numerous and correct, which \\\\n u great actor makes in the repre- \\\\n sentation of an entire dramatic \\\\n character, bear no proportion to \\\\n the number of those gestures \\\\n which do not belong to this class, \\\\n and which are no less necessary, \\\\n though they are not so splendid \\\\n a.nd imposing. The painter is \\\\n struck by the boldest and finest \\\\n of the significant gestures, which are called attitudes; \\\\n and he records them : they are the proper objects oi \\\\n his art ; they are striking, and less evanescent, than the \\\\n other gestures which pass unnoticed by him, although \\\\n they make up by far the greater and more important \\\\n part of the gestures requisite for illustrating the senti- \\\\n ments. These less prominent gestures give to the de- \\\\n clamation its precision and force. A slight movement \\\\n of the head, a look of the eye, a turn of the hand, a ju- \\\\n dicious pause, or interruption of gesture, or a change \\\\n of position in the feet, often illuminates the meaning \\\\n of a passage, and sends it, full of life and warmth, into \\\\n the understanding. And the perfection of gesture, in \\\\n a tragedian, will be found to consist more in the skilful \\\\n management of the less showy action, than in the exhi- \\\\n bition of the finest attiludes. Attitudes are danger \\\\n ons to hazard : the whole powers of the man mus\\\\\\'„ be \\\\n wrought up to their highest energy, or they become \\\\n forced and frigid. Excellent players have been seen, \\\\n who have never ventured an attitude ; but none, deserv- \\\\n ing the name of excellence, have ever appeared, whose \\\\n declamation has been deficient in precision or propriety \\\\n Where all the solid foundation of just and appropriate \\\\n action has been laid, attitude, when regulated witn \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 139 (#149) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE \\\\n \\\\n 139 \\\\n \\\\n taste and discretion, may be added to ornament the su- \\\\n perstructure ; but, when it is introduced unseasonably, \\\\n or is overcharged, it is an evidence of deficiency of un- \\\\n derstanding, as well as of depravity of taste. \\\\n \\\\n ATTITUDES OF MRS.

Some are so \\\\n happily formed that all their motions are graceful ;* \\\\n and some minds are so noble, that they impart genu- \\\\n ine grace to the most uncouth forms : both these cases, \\\\n however, are comparatively rare. \\\\n \\\\n Grace, like the ideal beauty of the painter, and of \\\\n the sculptor, is not commonly to be found in the indi- \\\\n vidual living model, but to be collected from the various \\\\n excellencies of the many. \\\\n \\\\n Neither true grace, nor consummate eloquence, can \\\\n be acquired by those who are totally deficient in natu- \\\\n ral qualifications; yet they to whom nature has not \\\\n denied some portion of talents, may improve in both, \\\\n precisely in proportion to the degree of their application. \\\\n \\\\n The grace of oratorical action consists, chiefly, in \\\\n the facility, the freedom, the variety, and the simplicity \\\\n of those gestures which illustrate the discourse. \\\\n \\\\n Action, to be graceful, should be performed with \\\\n facility ; because the appearance of great effort is in- \\\\n compatible with ease, which is a constituent of grace \\\\n It should also be performed with freedom : no gestures \\\\n can be graceful which are either confined by external \\\\n circumstances, or restrained by the mind. If an orator \\\\n should address an assembly from a narrow window, it \\\\n \\\\n * Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, \\\\n In every action, dignity and love. — Milton. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 148 (#158) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n148 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n v^ould be in vain for him to attempt graceful gesture. \\\\n Confinement, in any less degree, is proportionally in- \\\\n jurious to grace. Thus, the crowded courts, which \\\\n impede the motions of the advocate, and the enclosed \\\\n pulpit, which not unfrequentiy conceals more than half \\\\n the preacher\\\\\\'s figure, are equally injurious to graceful \\\\n action. Greece, the native soil of manly eloquence \\\\n and true taste, icas not the originator of the pulpit. \\\\n \\\\n The restraint arising from diffidence is also prejudi- \\\\n cial to grace. It has, however, this advantage — t \\\\n may be effectually corrected by perseverance. \\\\n \\\\n For the maintenance of grace, in rhetorical action, \\\\n variety is indispensable. The iteration of the same \\\\n gesture, or set of gestures, however graceful in them- \\\\n selves, betrays a poverty of resource which is altoge- \\\\n ther prejudicial to the speaker. \\\\n \\\\n Simplicity and truth of manner, if they do not con- \\\\n stitute grace in themselves, are inseparable from it. \\\\n Gestures which are manifestly contrived for the mere \\\\n display of the person, or for the exhibition of some fop- \\\\n pery, as, for instance, a fine ring, instantly offend. \\\\n \\\\n To simplicity of gesture is opposed affectation, which \\\\n destroys every pretension to genuine grace. The more \\\\n showy the gestures are, unless they are adapted to the \\\\n subject, and to the character of the speaker, the more do \\\\n they offend the judicious by their manifest affectation. \\\\n When the profligate speaks of piety, the miser of gene- \\\\n rosity, the coward of valour, and the corrupt of integ- \\\\n rity, they are only the more despised by those who \\\\n know them. \\\\n \\\\n The faults of manner are analogous to those of cha- \\\\n racter, and almost equally disgusting : such as the \\\\n assumption of dignity where there is none in the senti- \\\\n ment ; pathos, where there is nothing interesting ; vehe- \\\\n mence in trifles, and solemnity upon common-place \\\\n subjects. \\\\n \\\\n It is an observation founded in fact, that the action \\\\n of young children is never deficient in grace ; for which \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 149 (#159) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 149 \\\\n \\\\n two reasons may be assigned; first, because they are \\\\n under no restraint from diffidence, or from any other \\\\n cause, and therefore use their gestures, with ail sin- \\\\n cerity of heart, only to aid the expression of their \\\\n thoughts; and, secondly, because they have few ideas \\\\n of imitation, and consequently are not deprived of \\\\n natural grace by affectation, nor perverted by bad \\\\n models. \\\\n \\\\n The grace of action, according to Hogarth, consists \\\\n in moving the body and limbs in that curve which he \\\\n calls the line of beauty.* When action is considered \\\\n independent of language and sentiment, this definition \\\\n will, perhaps, be found generally correct. Rhetorical \\\\n action, however, derives its grace, not only from the \\\\n actual motions of the speaker, but also from the con- \\\\n gruity of his motions with his own character and situa- \\\\n tion, as well as with the sentiments which he delivers. \\\\n The dignity which is a becoming grace in a judge, \\\\n would be quaint affectation in a young advocate ; and \\\\n the colloquial, but graceful familiarity of action, even \\\\n of the most polished society, would be highly indeco- \\\\n rous in the pulpit. Hence, it must be admitted, ac- \\\\n cording to the just maxim of Cicero and Quintilian, \\\\n that decorum constitutes true oratorical grace ; and that \\\\n this decorum admits of great variety of action, under \\\\n different circumstances. Vehement action is sometimes \\\\n both decorous and graceful ; so also are abrupt and \\\\n short gestures, if they bear the impress of truth and \\\\n suitableness. Such are the gestures of an old man, \\\\n when he is irritated. But the most flowing and beau- \\\\n tiful motions, the grandest preparations, and the finest \\\\n transitions of gesture, ill applied, and out of time, lose \\\\n their natural character of grace, and become indeco- \\\\n rous, ridiculous, or offensive. \\\\n \\\\n * See Hogarth\\\\\\'s Analysis of Beauty. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 150 (#160) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n150 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n CHAPTER XIV. \\\\n \\\\n SYNOPTICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE NOTATION LETTER9. \\\\n \\\\n Letters written above the Line, relating to the Fingets, \\\\n the Hands, and the Arms. \\\\n \\\\n First small Letter, \\\\n Noting the disposition of the Fingers. \\\\n \\\\n n, natural. h, holding. \\\\n \\\\n c, clinched. to, hollow. \\\\n x, extended. ?», thumb. \\\\n \\\\n i, index. g, grasping. \\\\n \\\\n I, collected. \\\\n \\\\n Noting the Manner of presenting the Palm. \\\\n \\\\n p, prone. v, vertical. \\\\n \\\\n s, supine. /, forwards. \\\\n \\\\n w, inwards. b, backwards, \\\\n \\\\n o, outwards. \\\\n \\\\n Second small Letter, and two Capitals, \\\\n \\\\n Noting the Elevation of the Arms. \\\\n \\\\n d, downwards.

For this purpose they are divided \\\\n into four classes ; the notation letters of each always \\\\n preserve their own place, as to priority, or succession, \\\\n and derive their signification from it. The first four, \\\\n or the first three letters, taken together, are called a \\\\n set of letters. In a set, as phfd, or seq n, \\\\n \\\\n The first letter relates to the posture of the hand. \\\\n \\\\n The second, to the elevation of the arm. \\\\n \\\\n The third, to the transverse situation of the arm. \\\\n \\\\n The fourth, to the motion, or force of the gesture.* \\\\n \\\\n Thus, phfd is to be read, prone horizontal forward \\\\n descending. Prone, is the posture of the hand ; hori- \\\\n zontal, is the elevation of the arm; forward, is the pos- \\\\n ture of the arm in the transverse direction ; and de- \\\\n scending, means that the arm descends from a higher \\\\n elevation. The set, seq n, is read supine elevated oblique \\\\n noting. Supine, the posture of the hand ; elevated, the \\\\n arm, as to elevation ; oblique, the arm in the transverse \\\\n direction ; noting, the action of the hand and arm. \\\\n \\\\n As both hands and both arms are equally capable \\\\n of executing any gesture, the letters, and sets of letters, \\\\n relate to both indifferently. But they are thus distin- \\\\n guished : when there are two sets of small letters, the \\\\n first set denotes the gesture of the right hand and arm ; \\\\n the second, those of the left. The two sets are sepa- \\\\n rated by a short dash, thus : phq ■ — pdb, prone horizon- \\\\n tal oblique, the right hand ; and prone downwards back- \\\\n wards, the left. \\\\n \\\\n When only a single set of three, four, or five smal 1 \\\\n letters is marked, the gesture of one hand only is ex- \\\\n pressed ; that of the other is presumed to be easily \\\\n supplied, according to the rules of accompaniment. A \\\\n short dash always accompanies a single set of small \\\\n letters — when the dash follows the letters, they denote \\\\n the gesture of the right hand ; when the dash precedes \\\\n the letters, they denote the gesture of the left hand. \\\\n \\\\n * This last letter is often omitted. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 154 (#164) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n154 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n When a set of small letters is preceded by a capital \\\\n B, the gesture which they represent is to be performed \\\\n by both hands. \\\\n \\\\n When a long dash follows the small letters, connect- \\\\n ing them with other small letters, or with a single one, \\\\n farther on, a change of gesture is marked, which is to \\\\n take place on the word over which such letter or let- \\\\n ters are placed ; and the commencement and termina- \\\\n tion of the dash mark the commencement and termina- \\\\n tion of the gesture. \\\\n \\\\n When a set of small letters, having a dash, is con- \\\\n nected by a line of dots with another set of small letters, \\\\n having a contrary dash, the gesture made by the first \\\\n hand is to be followed and supported by another ges- \\\\n ture made by the other hand, which is to take place \\\\n where the second set of letters is marked. This is \\\\n called alternate gesture, and noted al. \\\\n \\\\n In order to prevent, confusion, the postures of the \\\\n head, and the direction of the eyes, are indicated by \\\\n capital letters near the beginning of the sentence, or at \\\\n some distance from the letters relating to the hands \\\\n and arms. \\\\n \\\\n The letters which mark the positions of the feet, and \\\\n the steps, are placed below the line, and under the word \\\\n where they should take place. \\\\n \\\\n THE MISER AND PLUTUS. \\\\n \\\\n (GAY.) \\\\n R BvJifr q peq n—pdq \\\\n \\\\n 1 . 2.

I \\\\n \\\\n Remarks on the Notation of the Miser and Plutus. \\\\n \\\\n For the convenience of reference, the piece is divided into sec- \\\\n tions, by vertical bars, and the number of each section is printed in \\\\n the margin. \\\\n \\\\n (1.) The direction of motion, expressed by the 4th small letter, \\\\n r, means that from the position in which both hands are presented, \\\\n vhf, they should move towards the right, and stop at the position, \\\\n oblique, as noted by q, connected by a dash to the position mentioned. \\\\n \\\\n (2.) The 4th small letter, n, signifies noting - . \\\\n \\\\n (12.) The posture of the hands is, at first, folded horizontal for- \\\\n wards, as expressed in the notation, Id hf. At the a, connected \\\\n by a dash, which signifies ascending, the hands are raised up, and \\\\n at the next notation, Id br, they are forcibly withdrawn back on the \\\\n breast. \\\\n \\\\n (21.) This posture begins horizontal, as first noted, Bvhf, and \\\\n ends elevated, B vef; but the B is omitted over the word, weak, \\\\n being understood by the connecting dash. \\\\n \\\\n (25.) The 3d small letter, relating to the transverse direction of \\\\n the arm, is often placed alone, but connected by a dash with a pre \\\\n ceding set of letters, as already observer (1.) In such case it is to \\\\n be understood that the posture of the hands remains as before, and \\\\n that the transverse direction of the arm only is changed. Here \\\\n each arm passes through the whole semicircle, from tie position \\\\n across to extended. \\\\n \\\\n The fourth, and the fifth small letter, which relates to the direc- \\\\n tion and manner of motion, are also often separated, in this manner \\\\n from the position to which they belong, in order that the place of \\\\n the motion, or action, may be the more distinctly marked. (See 9, \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 157 (#167) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 157 \\\\n \\\\n 15 ahd 20, in which n is thus separated, to point out the particular \\\\n eyllable on which the action of noting falls ) \\\\n \\\\n The action of the hands and arms, at No. 15 and 20, is the same, \\\\n but the general effect is different, in consequence of the difference \\\\n in the positions of the feet. In the preparation for these gestures, \\\\n the palms of both hands are raised so as almost to touch the fore- \\\\n head ; then they descend gradually, and when the arms are a little \\\\n below the horizontal elevation, the wrists make that particular \\\\n motion called noting, on the respective words, stores and cheat. \\\\n \\\\n (26.) Left foot first position extended. To make this position \\\\n extended, the left foot is advanced, the body at the same time is \\\\n thrown back, and sinks a little, bending the right knee. \\\\n \\\\n (28.)

First Line. Ls, listening-. (See complex signifi- \\\\n cant gestures.) The small «, over knell, is connected with the set \\\\n of letters, B pef, over parting ; and the small d, over day, is also \\\\n connected with the same set. Each is considered a fourth small \\\\n letter, separated from its &et ; a denotes the preparation, and d, the \\\\n termination of the motion of the gesture. Second line. The set \\\\n of letters, phd, relates to the right hand, which finishes its action \\\\n at x, and falls slowly to rest. Third line. Here the left hand \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 162 (#172) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n162 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n takes up the principal gesture. This is called alternate gesture. \\\\n Both hands unite their action on weary. Fourth Line. V, the \\\\n eyes bent on vacancy. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza II.) The several gestures which are connected toge- \\\\n tner by long dashes, are to be considered as the flowing variation of \\\\n continued motion, till either one, or both hands fall to rest. Ges- \\\\n tures, thus connected, maybe called continuous; they are gene- \\\\n rally of that kind which are styled discriminating gestures. First \\\\n line. The posture, Bphc, on fades, is the preparation for sweep- \\\\n ing round the horizon. Whilst the hands are proceeding to the \\\\n position, Bphc, the head and eyes should turn towards either ex- \\\\n treme ; and whilst the arms are moving from this to the different \\\\n positions, q and x, the head and eyes should move to the other ex- \\\\n treme. In cases where the right hand performs the principal ac- \\\\n tion, the head should follow its motion ; in other words, it should \\\\n turn from left to right, and vice versa. Third line. The left hand \\\\n drops here, and the index-finger of the right hand is prepared to \\\\n point across. The eye should follow the object at which the finger \\\\n seems to point, as at a flying beetle. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza III.) In order to vary the gestures, and the better to \\\\n distribute the objects in the picture, the tower is supposed to be \\\\n placed on the left side, and the left hand assumes the principal ges- \\\\n ture; this is indicated, in the notation, by the short dash which \\\\n precedes the set of letters. Fourth line. \" Ancient, solitary\" \\\\n Nouns, or, substantives, may be considered as the outlines, or im- \\\\n ages of things; adjectives, as the colouring, or circumstances added \\\\n to those images, or limitations deducting something from them. In \\\\n poetical language they are called epithets. Gray has indulged in \\\\n the use of them, perhaps to a fault. But however that may be, \\\\n whenever they occur, they almost constantly rob the principal image, \\\\n or substantive, of its emphatic distinction, and claim it for themselves ; \\\\n perhaps, because the circumstances alone give individuality to the \\\\n image, which, in itself, is a general term. For these reasons, the \\\\n action, or gesture, falls rather on the epithet; and, if two, or more \\\\n epithets are added to the same image, each should be distinctly \\\\n marked, both by emphasis and action: if so pronounced, they serve \\\\n to illustrate the idea; but if they are hurried over, they cause only \\\\n confusion. Therefore, the words ancient solitary reign, require \\\\n two gestures, one on each epithet. But, to avoid affectation, the \\\\n transition should be the easiest possible ; and this will be when the \\\\n gesture on the preceding word is made the preparation for that on \\\\n the subsequent. When two epithets are applied to a name, the \\\\n latter should be the stronger; and in this view, also, it is proper to \\\\n reserve the emphatic gesture for it, as the principal. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza IV.) First line. On elms, the right hand again re- \\\\n sumes the principal gesture. It is here alternate, or auxiliary, as \\\\n appears from the dotted line of connexion. Second line. On heaves \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 163 (#173) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 163 \\\\n \\\\n the backs of the hands are presented forwards, the hands hanging \\\\n down, and in the action they ascend gradually towards vertical eleva- \\\\n ted, on the word mouldering. Third line. \" Each in his narrow cell \\\\n for ever laid ;\" the arms gradually ascend to the highest point, on the \\\\n word ever, and then, in the same manner, descend, to rest on the \\\\n word sleep, making, in their progress, a momentary arrest on the \\\\n word forefathers. It seems to be an incongruity to raise the arms, \\\\n in speaking of the grave, which is below ; but this is removed by \\\\n the downward inclination of the head, and look of the eyes, as noted ; \\\\n and it is not uncommon to elevate the arms in looking into any \\\\n thing dreadful below. This is also the preparation for the following \\\\n gesture, which requires the arms to fall to rest. From the third \\\\n line to the end of the stanza the gestures are continuous. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza V.) First line. On breathing the graceful wave is \\\\n marked. The wave may be considered of three kinds, the graceful, \\\\n the wave of triumph (which, in a less degree, is also the wave of \\\\n joy), and the wave of scorn, or contempt. The subject will always \\\\n sufficiently determine the character to be adopted, though the no- \\\\n tation is the same for all. Second line. On swallow, the index is \\\\n raised, to point out the object ; on twittering it ascends to the high- \\\\n est point in the range of gesture, or is retracted, so as almost to \\\\n touch the head, and then on the word straw-built it makes the ac- \\\\n tion of noting. Third line. The joyful wave, approaching to tri- \\\\n umph, should be made on echoing ; the voice should here mark the \\\\n crescendo, which will be contrasted with the gravity of the follow \\\\n ing line. Fourth line. In order to perform the action of springing, \\\\n indicated by sp, the arms begin to ascend from more, and having \\\\n arrived at the word rouse, the wrists make on it the stroke of the \\\\n gesture by springing suddenly into the elevated position. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza VI.) Fourth line. The gesture on climb is a suspend- \\\\n ing gesture, preparatory to that on kiss. The eyes look downwards \\\\n on climb, and forwards on kiss. The ends of the fingers approach \\\\n the mouth a little on kiss, after which the hands are advanced su- \\\\n pine noting. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza VII.) Second line. The preparation for the gesture \\\\n on stubborn is neq rt, and would fall on oft, but is here omitted as \\\\n taking place, of course, when the gesture marked on stubborn is \\\\n executed. It will be observed that several emphatic gestures im- \\\\n ply a proper suspending, or preparatory gesture, and reciprocally, \\\\n the latter the former. Thus, when a stroke is required to be made, \\\\n the arm must, of course, be raised ; therefore, shf st must necessa- \\\\n rily imply nefbn, inwards elevated forwards bending ; veq w im- \\\\n plies, bhf a, backwards horizontal forwards ascending ; and vhxrj, \\\\n implies, vhx rt, vertical horizontal extended retracting. In the \\\\n notation, the preparatory gestures are often omitted, when they arc \\\\n not required to make a preceding less emphatic word ; in which \\\\n case they are prepared with less decision, and their stroke is soft- \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 164 (#174) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n164 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n cried. When the suspending-, or preparatory gesture is used as the \\\\n principal, as in terror, where the arms are retracted violently, and \\\\n in surprise, where they are elevated forcibly, the subsequent ges- \\\\n ture is also softened ; and the emphasis of its stroke is remitted. \\\\n Fourth line. Should woods not be pronounced with a strong em- \\\\n phasis, the notation over this word might be omitted. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza VIII.) The first gesture in each of the first three \\\\n lines of this stanza, is a preparatory gesture, of the decisive kind, \\\\n and the last, in each, emphatic. As all the words which are noted \\\\n are important, each requires the enforcement of gesture; and the \\\\n connexion of suspending, or preparatory and emphatic gestures, \\\\n renders the transitions easy and unaffected. Second line. The \\\\n noun, destiny, being here placed before its adjective, or epithet, \\\\n may obtain both the emphasis and action ; they might, also, be re- \\\\n served for the epithet obscure. Fourth line. \"• Short and simple ;\" \\\\n the first epithet is distinguished by a slight discriminating gesture, \\\\n produced by a small change in the elevation of the arm and hand, \\\\n marked a. This is made the commencement of the gesture vef, \\\\n which is completed by a suspending gesture on simple, and which \\\\n descends to rest on the word poor, with an emphatic and terminat- \\\\n ing gesture. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza IX.) First line. The flourish is marked on power. \\\\n The flourish, as expressed in Fig. 88, is performed principally by \\\\n the wrist. In order to perform this action, the hand, with the in- \\\\n dex-finger, is dropped down a little above the head, nearly at right \\\\n angles with the fore-arm, and is then thrown forcibly upwards, and \\\\n sweeps round as marked by the line of dots in the figure. To ad- \\\\n vance boldly, indicates confidence, pride, &c. ; to advance slowly, \\\\n implies solemnity, grief, resignation, &c. The notation is the same, \\\\n in each case, as the sentiments sufficiently show in what manner \\\\n the speaker should advance. Of the former (bold advance), an in \\\\n stance is observed on the word power, in this line; of the latter \\\\n (slow advance), an instance is seen on the word grave, in the last \\\\n line. Third line. The shake, sh, is marked on inevitable. It \\\\n should not comprise many tremulous motions, lest it appear ridicu- \\\\n lous ; it is sufficient that the hand move twice suddenly backwards \\\\n and forwards. Fourth line. The gestures in this line are continu- \\\\n ous. The first, on paths, is a discriminating gesture, leading to \\\\n the suspending gesture, on glory. The gesture on lead, is the pre- \\\\n paration for that which descends to the word grave, on which falls \\\\n the emphatic and terminating gesture. The advance, noted in this \\\\n line, aR2, for the step, combines with the descending arms, and aids \\\\n in looking down with resignation. But it might be r/21, or rIA % \\\\n which would express terror, or alarm. / prefer aR2. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza XL) Second line. From back, both hands (the palma \\\\n inwards), move inwards, so that at mansion they nearly touch tha \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 165 (#175) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 165 \\\\n \\\\n lips, as noted ; they then move outwards to the position oblique, on \\\\n the word fleeting. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza Xll.) Third line. There is a suspending gesture on \\\\n hands, which is the preparation for the subsequent gesture. It \\\\n might have been omitted, as it is obviously implied, were it not \\\\n thought proper to mark the word hands with some force ; and, in \\\\n this way, it obtains the distinction of gesture without extravagance \\\\n or unnecessary waste of gesture. Were this preparatory gesture \\\\n not marked, the hands would ascend, by a uniform motion, to rod, \\\\n then make the stroke on empire, which would be feeble, and, if \\\\n noted at large, would be thus : \\\\n \\\\n B shfst \\\\n \\\\n Hands that the rod of empire might have sway\\\\\\'d. \\\\n \\\\n Fourth line. The double sweep is here performed — first inwards, \\\\n on ecstasy, and then outwards, on lyre. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza XIII.) The gesture on penury is a suspending one; \\\\n its fourth and its fifth letter, rp, which express the manner of mo- \\\\n tion, being separated, in order to place them over their proper syl- \\\\n lable. The notation, at large, would be as follows : \\\\n \\\\n _ B vhf rt B v/if rp \\\\n \\\\n Chill penury repressed, &c. \\\\n \\\\n The first retracting, the last repressing ; this, however, is under- \\\\n stood from the nature of the emphatic gesture. Fourth line. The \\\\n fourth small letter, c, over froze, signifies contracted. The gesture \\\\n on current serves as a preparation for placing the hands on the \\\\n breast. This gesture, Bnhfp, begins on genial, and the arms are \\\\n stretched out, with some force, on current. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza XIV.) Third line. On the won] flower, shfrt might \\\\n be placed, as the preparation for the gesture on blush; but as the \\\\n word does not require a strong emphasis, the notation is omitted; \\\\n however, the gesture is implied. (See remarks on Stanza VII.) \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza XV.) Fourth line. When from the transverse posi- \\\\n tion, c, the arms move directly to x, without noting the interme- \\\\n diate position, q, as here, on country\\\\\\'s blood, the motion is under- \\\\n stood to be rapid, and decisive, expressing vehemence or horror. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza XVI.) Second line. The gestures necessary to be \\\\n marked, on this line, are four, of which the second, on pain, and \\\\n the third, on ruin, are made by the momentary arrest of the hand, \\\\n in its ascent to vef, on the first syllable of despise ,- rj* rejecting, on \\\\n the last syllable, finishes the whole with the emphatic stroke. \\\\n Thus sufficient discrimination is made, without falling into quaint- \\\\n ness of gesture, or affectation. These small discriminating ges- \\\\n tures, produced by a slight arrest of motion, and often by merely \\\\n changing the posture of the hand, are more frequent, and more im \\\\n portant to the orator, than the more showy gestures, and should be \\\\n particularly attended to. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 166 (#176) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n166 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n (Stanza. XVII.) The last two lines have each a series of con- \\\\n tinuous gestures. \\\\n \\\\n From the preceding- analysis and notation, it will be observed that \\\\n the discriminating gestures are principally requisite for the recit- \\\\n ing of this poem. The suspending and the emphatic are frequent; \\\\n but the last seldom require to be strongly marked, as the general \\\\n character of the sentiments is calm and tender. Of significant \\\\n gestures there are very few. The first, marked Ls, listening, over \\\\n curfew, is of this class, and perhaps a few others may also be \\\\n reckoned to belong to it, as when the hand is laid on the breast; but \\\\n there are not many more. \\\\n \\\\n As these gestures may be varied, it may be said, infinitely, so \\\\n there can be no fixed standard, as to the manner of delivering this, \\\\n or any other poem, or oration, which should be considered exclusively \\\\n appropriate. The sentiments require, indeed, to be delivered with \\\\n suitable tones of voice, and expression of countenance; but great \\\\n variety of gesture may be consistent with propriety, provided gene- \\\\n ral rules are not violated : as, that decorum and simplicity be ob- \\\\n served; that the transitions, connexions, the time of the gesture, \\\\n and precision in the stroke, be attended to, and other obvious precau- \\\\n tions, of general import, already sufficiently detailed. The notation \\\\n will accommodate itself to every variety in the speaker\\\\\\'s manner; \\\\n and this must prove a recommendation to its use. \\\\n \\\\n THE SPEECH OF BRUTUS ON THE DEATH OP C^JSAR. \\\\n \\\\n (SHAKSPEARE.) \\\\n B shfp q vex sp B nef \\\\n \\\\n Romans, countrymen, and lovers ! hear me for \\\\n \\\\n aR2 rRl \\\\n \\\\n B shf st pef — phx phf st— R \\\\n \\\\n my cause ; and be silent that you may hear. \\\\n \\\\n Bshfp br — R br pr — veq sp \\\\n \\\\n Believe me for mine honour; and have respect unto \\\\n \\\\n aR2 \\\\n \\\\n Bshfn D B pef \\\\n \\\\n mine honour that you may believe.

These are \\\\n suited to the vehemence of the speaker\\\\\\'s manner, which seeks no \\\\n ornament, but hastens to produce the main impression on his hearers, \\\\n by the most direct method. An inspection of the notation will make \\\\n his evident ; for, even though the reader may wish tr alter many \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 169 (#179) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 169 \\\\n \\\\n particular gestures which are here noted, he must change them for \\\\n others of the same nature, if he would preserve the character of the \\\\n speech. The suspending and the emphatic gestures must still \\\\n abound, and he will find little opportunity for introducing the other \\\\n descriptions, which are, in general, too tame for the abrupt and ve- \\\\n hement style of this speech. \\\\n \\\\n \" Be silent that you may hear. 1 \\\\\\'\\\\\\' On these words I have marked \\\\n the gesture for the left hand, as well as that for the right, and also \\\\n on the words, \" have respect unto mine honour.\\\\\\'\\\\\\'\\\\\\'\\\\\\' This last is an \\\\n auxiliary gesture, but of the vehement kind. The exordium of this \\\\n singular oration ends at \" better judge ;\" after which, the arms \\\\n should fall to rest, and there should be a considerable pause. An- \\\\n other division, which may be called the proposition, takes place at \\\\n \"live all freemen \" another, the narration, at \"death for his am- \\\\n bition \" and that which may be called the pathetic, or appeal to \\\\n the passions, finishes at \" I pause for a reply.\\\\\\'*\\\\\\'\\\\\\' The argument, or \\\\n reasoning, ends at \" suffered death ;\" and the peroration follows. \\\\n \\\\n \" I weep for him?* This is noted E — R, the right hand on the \\\\n eyes, the left at rest. \\\\n \\\\n \"Him have I offended \" noted on \"him, 1 \\\\\\'\\\\\\' ihfrc, recoiling. In \\\\n this action the finger is pointed suddenly, and scornfully ; then im- \\\\n mediately withdrawn. \\\\n \\\\n Frequent changes in the positions of the feet indicate anxiety ; \\\\n they are, therefore, noted, in this speech. \\\\n \\\\n \"His body, mourned;\" auxiliary gesture. When the right \\\\n hand is brought up on \" mourned,\\\\\\'\\\\\\'\\\\\\'\\\\\\' both hands become supine ; and, \\\\n on the next words, \" by Mark Antony,\" they make the action of \\\\n noting. At \"Here comes,\" noted B, the speaker looks back; at \\\\n \" Mark Antony,\" noted F, he looks forward to those whom he ad- \\\\n dresses. It would be tedious to point out all the suspending ges- \\\\n tures, succeeded immediately by the emphatic, for they abound. \\\\n In all the antitheses, which are numerous, the suspending will be \\\\n found over the first member, and the emphatic over the last. \\\\n \\\\n EXTRACT FROM YOUNG S NIGHT THOUGHTS. \\\\n \\\\n U vefn F B nef \\\\n \\\\n The bell strikes one.

He heaps them profusely, \\\\n and in every manner, on the principal idea. Man is here his sub- \\\\n ject, which he colours with every variety of tint, exhibits in every \\\\n light, and touches and re-touches almost to disgust. And yet he \\\\n has here produced many sublime images ; and his very faults, his \\\\n labour, his antitheses and his catachreses,* are the source of his \\\\n beauties. This passage is particularly difficult to recite. The dif- \\\\n \\\\n * Catachresis, a figure of speech by which one word is abusive^? \\\\n put for another. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 172 (#182) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n172 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n ficnlty arises cbiefiy from the multiplicity of the images, and the \\\\n brevity of the expression ; consequently, if the speaker is not care- \\\\n ful to pronounce every line with due deliberation, his gesture makes \\\\n confusion only, and gives an air of mummery to his recitation. \\\\n This condensation of images occurs in almost every line ; but the \\\\n twenty -sixth line, which consists of only four words, is remarkable. \\\\n \" Helpless immortal ! insect infinite !\" \\\\n \\\\n To give force and variety, and, at the same time, simplicity and \\\\n gracefulness to gestures so heaped on each other, is attended with \\\\n no inconsiderable difficulty. But even should the speaker\\\\\\'s manner, \\\\n in the recitation of these lines, prove unexceptionable in this re- \\\\n spect, the difficulty is but half conquered. They do not, indeed, \\\\n require any considerable variety of voice; but the eye and the coun- \\\\n tenance of the speaker must be full of expression and intelligence: \\\\n he must appear to be rapt in meditation, which rises into sublimity \\\\n as it proceeds, and inflames, as it catches the rapid succession of \\\\n thought. On these accounts, this passage is seldom recited suc- \\\\n cessfully. \\\\n \\\\n After what has been said in the analysis of the other pieces, a \\\\n few observations will suffice for this. \\\\n \\\\n Line 4, \"aright,\" continuous gesture to the end of the 5th line, \\\\n where the hand falls to rest with some degree of force, noted R st, \\\\n rest, striking. The hand, generally, in falling to rest, drops quietly \\\\n and imperceptibly by its own gravity, and it is then noted with a \\\\n simple R ; but sometimes the hand is struck down forcibly, and then \\\\n it is noted, as above, R st. \\\\n \\\\n Line 8. \" How much ;\" the x, in the fourth place, means that \\\\n the arms are to be extended forwards eagerly. \\\\n \\\\n Line 14, 15, 16, six epithets, antithesis, and a climax: the voice \\\\n and gesture must increase in energy, and on \" Ae,\" in the 16th line, \\\\n complete the climax. The first, in each pair of gestures, is pre- \\\\n paratory to the subsequent, in the antithesis. \\\\n \\\\n Line 23 to 25. Antitheses and catachreses heaped on each \\\\n other, each requiring a separate gesture, strongly contrasted with \\\\n that to which it is opposed. \\\\n \\\\n Line 29. F st, the hand striking the forehead. \\\\n \\\\n GENERAL REMARKS. \\\\n \\\\n In order to render every circumstance perfectly intelligible, I have \\\\n marked with the notation letters the gestures in the preceding ex- \\\\n amples more minutely than is necessary for general use. For gene- \\\\n ral use, it is sufficient to note the most important circumstances, \\\\n leaving the filling up to the judgment of the speaker. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 173 (#183) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 173 \\\\n \\\\n In the recitation of descriptions of any kind, the speaker must, in \\\\n imagination, have the picture before his eyes, and each object must \\\\n be disposed in the same order as if actually painted. If this imagi- \\\\n nary picture be faulty in the composition, confused, or ill-grouped \\\\n the gesture will perplex, rather than enlighten ; but, if well con- \\\\n ceived, and well disposed in its parts, the speaker will seem to give \\\\n it the interest of life by his skilful gesture and recitation; and the \\\\n puditor will almost imagine that he actually contemplates all that \\\\n the speaker describes. \\\\n \\\\n Impassioned compositions, delivered with proper feeling and ex- \\\\n pression, open, in like manner, to the view of the hearer, the inter- \\\\n nal operations of the speaker\\\\\\'s mind, — a contemplation still more \\\\n interesting than any scenes of external nature which can be pre- \\\\n sented in description. \\\\n \\\\n As, in writing, even an appropriate term must not be used too \\\\n frequently, so in this art, the same gesture, however expressive, \\\\n must not be too often repeated. Variety is graceful, and requires \\\\n that similar gestures, as well as similar words, should be separated \\\\n b.v those which are diverse. \\\\n \\\\n In oratorical action, it is a general rule that each new idea requires \\\\n a new gesture. But important ideas, only, require distinguished \\\\n gesture. For these last, therefore, should be reserved the species of \\\\n gestures named emphatic; for the former (which are the most nu- \\\\n merous), the discriminating will be sufficient. As to frequency, the \\\\n propriety of gesture will be found to depend on the deliberation and \\\\n expression of the speaker. If the feelings are not alive, and if the \\\\n lines are not pronounced with due deliberation, the gestures will \\\\n appear to be too numerous. In the preceding examples they may \\\\n seem to have this fault, from the circumstance that it is my object \\\\n to exhibit at large the greater part of their minute connexions and \\\\n transitions. A little attention, however, will show, that much, \\\\n still, has been left to be supplied by the judgment of the reader. \\\\n \\\\n The notation, and the analytical observations on the foregoing \\\\n pieces, will, it is conceived, afford sufficient information to such as \\\\n may desire to assist their rhetorical studies by this system. I would \\\\n not recommend that the young speaker, in using this notation, should \\\\n mark every possible passage in his discourse, in the manner of these \\\\n examples; for such minuteness would lead to embarrassment, un- \\\\n less preceded by much labour. The utmost advisable notation \\\\n should not exceed a few marks on particular passages, and those \\\\n separated from each other; the filling up of which should be trusted \\\\n to the feelings of the moment. But the best method, in all re- \\\\n spects, for acquiring a finished rhetorical delivery, is the private \\\\n practice of declamation, which is supported on the authority of the \\\\n great masters and models of oratory, Demosthenes and Cicero. The \\\\n aspiring rhetorical student should select one or more celebrated \\\\n orations, couched in the style that he wishes to adopt; these he \\\\n 12 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 174 (#184) ############################################\\\\n\\\\n174 ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n should carefully subject to all the rules of notation ; he should study \\\\n them, and commit them to memory ; he will exercise on them all \\\\n the powers of his voice, his countenance and gesture ; and, like De- \\\\n mosthenes, consult his mirror, and obtain the opinion of a judicious \\\\n friend on his performances. The knowledge and facility, which, \\\\n by repeated exercises of this kind, he will acquire in rhetorical \\\\n delivery, may be transferred, with advantage, to his own composi- \\\\n tions which are to be delivered in public; and, without hazarding \\\\n the inconveniences of particular notation, he will find himself pos- \\\\n sessed of such a store of various, forcible, and expressive action, \\\\n that, whatever his feelings shall suggest at the moment, he will be \\\\n able to execute in a satisfactory manner. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 175 (#185) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nGESTURE. 175 \\\\n \\\\n QUESTIONS \\\\n \\\\n TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PUPIL. \\\\n \\\\n ELOCUTION. \\\\n \\\\n Page 15.

For instance, I select some piece, and divide it \\\\n into sections. The first of these sections I pronounce in the falsetto \\\\n voice, and request the pupil, or, what is better, the whole class, to \\\\n pronounce it in like manner; the second section I pronounce in the \\\\n lowest note of the natural voice, and it is immediately repeated by \\\\n the class ; the third, in the highest note of the natural voice ; the \\\\n fourth in a whisper; the fifth, in the medium pitch of the natural \\\\n voice; and so on.

But, when the precedes a word beginning with a conso- \\\\n nant, and is emphatic, it should be pronounced the, thus — Did you \\\\n say a man or the man 1 \\\\n \\\\n The pronoun my, when emphatic, is pronounced ml ; when not \\\\n emphatic, it is generally pronounced me. Sometimes the perspi- \\\\n cuity of a sentence requires my to be pronounced ml, when this \\\\n pronoun is not emphatic, as in the following example: \\\\n \"And the pale stars shall be at night, \\\\n The only eyes that watch my rite.\" \\\\n \\\\n Should my, in the above example, be pronounced me, by a public \\\\n speaker, the auditors might suppose the meaning of the passage to \\\\n be as follows : \\\\n \\\\n And the pale stars shall be at night, \\\\n The only eyes that watch me right. \\\\n \\\\n Euphony sometimes requires my, when not emphatic, to be pro- \\\\n nounced ml. The following passages are examples: \\\\n \\\\n \" My brave associates.\" \" Hear me for my cause.\" \" When it \\\\n shall please my country to need my death.\" \\\\n \\\\n Mine should always be pronounced mine, not mean; by should \\\\n always be pronounced bl, not bee; to should be pronounced t6, not \\\\n tu ; of should be pronounced 6v, not uv ; and from should be pro- \\\\n nounced fr6m, not frum. \\\\n \\\\n The pronunciation of many other words, liable to be pronounced \\\\n wrong, is given in the foot-notes under the Exercises in Reading \\\\n and Declamation. \\\\n \\\\n SIXTEENTH EXERCISE. \\\\n \\\\n DECLAMATION. \\\\n \\\\n Before the student attempts to declaim, he should learn to stand \\\\n erect; to hold his book in a proper manner, and to read correctly. \\\\n He should then select some short piece, and learn a set of gestures \\\\n for its illustration by practising them in pantomime, after the \\\\n teacher.

[See the Pre- \\\\n face.] \\\\n \\\\n ( i ) A separation mark. It signifies that the words between \\\\n which it is placed, should not coalesce. \\\\n \\\\n (n) A rest. Where this character is employed there should be \\\\n a slight suspension of the voice. \\\\n \\\\n (-) A hold. The vowels over which this character is placed, \\\\n should have an unusual prolongation. \\\\n \\\\n (o) A pause, called also a suspending pause. When placed over \\\\n a rest, it signifies that this rest should have two or three times its \\\\n usual length. It is called a suspending pause, because it keeps \\\\n the mind of the hearer in suspense. [See an example on page 221, \\\\n seventh line from the bottom.] \\\\n \\\\n ( M / \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\' * \\\\\\' ) Acute and grave accents. They are employed to \\\\n represent the rising and falling inflections, and also the emphasis \\\\n melodies. [See page 48 and 54.] \\\\n \\\\n (a) Acuto-grave accent, or acuto-grave circumflex. [See p. 48.] \\\\n \\\\n (\") Gravo-acute accent, or gravo-acute circumflex. [See p. 48.] \\\\n \\\\n (ir) Irony. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, is \\\\n ironical. \\\\n \\\\n (rp) Reproach. When these letters are prefixed to a passage, \\\\n it contains the language of reproach. \\\\n \\\\n (wh) Whisper. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, \\\\n should be whispered. \\\\n \\\\n (1, 2, 3, 4) These numbers represent the degrees of modulation. \\\\n [See p. 57.] \\\\n \\\\n The italic letters represent sounds which are liable to be omitted, \\\\n or imperfectly articulated. When all the letters in a word are \\\\n italic, the word is emphatic. The emphatic words, however, are \\\\n seldom, in this work, marked by italic letters. \\\\n \\\\n In designating the pronunciation of words, in the foot-notes, I \\\\n have used the letters which, on page 19, and 20, represent the ele- \\\\n ments of the English language. No superfluous letters are em- \\\\n ployed, as is done by lexicographers. The pronunciation of each \\\\n word is determined by the letters which represent the sounds of \\\\n which it is composed, and by the situation of the accent. \\\\n \\\\n (216) \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x0c\\\\n\\\\n## p. 217 (#227) ############################################\\\\n\\\\nPART II. \\\\n \\\\n EXERCISES IN READING AND DECLA \\\\n MATION. \\\\n \\\\n SPEECH OF SATAN TO HIS LEGIONS. \\\\n \\\\n (MILTON.) \\\\n \\\\n Narrative, \\\\n \\\\n He scarce had ceas\\\\\\'d, | when the superior fiend 1 \\\\n \\\\n Was moving tow\\\\\\'rd the shores ; | his pond\\\\\\'rous shield, | \\\\n \\\\n Etherial temper, mas\\\\\\'sy, large\\\\\\', and round\\\\\\', | \\\\n \\\\n Behind Aim cas^ ; I the broad circumference a | \\\\n \\\\n Hung on Ais shoulders \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ke the moon | whose orb \\\\n \\\\n Through optic glass | the Tuscan artist views \\\\n \\\\n At evening | from the top of Feso-le, | \\\\n \\\\n Or in Valdar no, c l to descry new lands\\\\\\', | \\\\n \\\\n Riv\\\\\\'ers, or mountains/ 1 in her spotty globe. | \\\\n \\\\n His spear\\\\\\' I (to equal which | the tallest pine,! \\\\n \\\\n Hewn on Norwegian hills, | to be the m-dst \\\\n \\\\n Of some greaZ amiral, e |were hut a wand\\\\\\') | \\\\n \\\\n He walk\\\\\\'d^ with, | to support uneasy steps | \\\\n \\\\n Over the burning marl, I (not like those steps \\\\n \\\\n On heaven\\\\\\'s a\\\\\\'zure ! f ) I and the torrid clime | \\\\n \\\\n Smote on him sore besides^ | vaulted with fire v : | \\\\n \\\\n Nathless\" he so endur\\\\\\'d, I till on the beach \\\\n \\\\n Of thai inflamed sea he stood, I and call\\\\\\'d \\\\n \\\\n His le x gions, | angel-forms | who lay entranc\\\\\\'d | \\\\n \\\\n a Ser-ktim\\\\\\'fe-r£ns. b Gallileo.
