Thermometrical Register.
THE Thermometrical Register, showing the highest and lowest temperature of the
corresponding month of the preceding year, has been resumed in the British Almanac
this year at the request of numerous correspondents. These registers are copied from
those made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. They show the highest and lowest
ranges within each twenty-four hours, from self-registering thermometers. Each
month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most ready and
advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register of the
last three months of 1870 follows the nine months of 1871, which are all that can be
given up to the day of publication.
Equation of Time.
In this Almanac the calculations are all made for mean time (given by the clock),
instead of apparent time (given by the sun-dial), which latter had been used up to the
year 1833. It must be obvious that, for all practical purposes, mean time is the most
useful; and to obtain it from apparent time, the columns in the Almanac headed
“ Equation of Time" should be used. The column “Equation of Time" ought, for
example, to be consulted when persons are desirous of setting their clock by a sun-dial.
When clock after sun is written above the number of minutes and seconds opposite to the
day, then the clock ought to be set so much slower than the sun-dial, and the contrary.
Moonlight.
The Moon's age is set down in days and the nearest tenths of days from the time of
change. Thus it is New Moon on the 8th of April at Oh. 32m. morning, and there-
fore at noon of that day she is 11h. 28m. old, which is set down as five-tenths. The
fraction of the day of course continues the same throughout the lunation. See also
the table showing the duration of moonlight on page 10.
VARIATION OF THE COMPAss, or the declination of the magnetic or mariner's needle
from the meridian or true north and south line at the undermentioned places in the
United Kingdom, estimated for the year 1872.
N.B.—The variation is westerly, that is, the magnetic pole is west of the true north
pole, and is found to be decreasing in the United Kingdom about 9' annually.

AUXILIARY TABLE FOR FINDING THE TIME OF SUN-
RISING AND SETTING.
The time of Sunrise and Sunset in the British Almanac' is adapted to the parallel of
Latitude in which London is situate-viz., 51° 30'.
THE table, pages 3-4, has been constructed to show the variations of time through the
United Kingdom-namely, between the latitude of 58° and 50° 10' N. The times of
sun-rising and sun-setting are computed for the instant that the sun's centre is even
with the horizon of the sea. The number of minutes found in this table under the
month-day, and in the required latitude, are to be applied to the time of sun-rising
and setting found on that day in the Almanac; the result will be the time of his
rising and setting at the place required.--Ex. At what time will the sun fise and
set on May 21 at Edinburgh? The times of sunrise and sunset on that day in the
Almanac are 4h. lm. A.m., and 7h. 52m. P.M. In the table, in parallel of 56°, in which
(p. 3) Edinburgh is found, and under May 21, are 23 minutes; which, subtracted from
4h. Im., leaves 3h. 38m. for time of sunrise; and, added to 7h. 52m., gives 8h. 15m.
for time of sun-setting. But at those places where instead of mean time at place* rail-
way time is now used, which in Great Britain is Greenwich mean time, and in Ireland
Dublin mean time, to the times of sun-rising and sun-setting, as deduced by the aux-
iliary table, the longitude in time must be applied thus:-For places in Great Britain
whose longitude is west of Greenwich, to the time of sunrise or sunset add the longi-
tude in time, and to places whose longitude is east of Greenwich, subtract the longitude
in time, the result will be the railway or Greenwich time that the sun rises or sets.
N.B.-Longitude in arc, indicated by the signs /" (degrees, minutes, and seconds)
is converted into longitude in time by reckoning 360° — 24 h., 15º =lh., and 1°= 4m.
Example:-On June 21st at Penzance, in latitude 50° 7' N. and longitude 5° 31' W.,
what will be the railway time that the sun rises and sets ?

The Present State of Music in England. 65
Such a national school as we desire to see established might fitly
be formed out of the present Royal Academy, which with an en-
larged income and an extended scheme of operations would
be well able to undertake the work. Free education ought
to be provided for a considerable number of pupils, inasmuch
as experience proves that some of the most gifted musicians
- are to be found among the lower ranks of society, and the fees
payable by the other students ought to be very much lower than
those now charged, while it would also be desirable to add a general
educational establishment to the institution. In connection with
it evening classes might be formed, and an orchestra might
be permanently kept up for the trial of new works, thus offering
to English composers an advantage the want of which has too
long acted as a discouragement. Another important question is
the
best means of providing elementary training for the people,
and especially the young in our large towns. The teaching of
music in the parochial schools will do much to promote this result
if, as we hope will be the case, sight-singing and not singing by
ear is insisted on : but the adults and the young men and women
still remain to be provided for. One point is very plain, that
if musical education becomes general, there will in future be
a better supply of competent teachers for the training of the
children, and if the numerous school-rooms controlled by the
local boards are made available for evening instruction, much
may be done.
Classes on the old notation and on the Tonic
Sol-Fa system might be conducted on different evenings, and
in nearly every case they would be found to be self-sup-
porting, especially if concerts were given at intervals by the
pupils. But while the poor are cared for, the higher classes
must not be neglected. Music must be efficiently taught in all
our large public and middle-class schools for boys; and in girls'
schools, where the pianoforte has always formed a subject of in-
struction, the system must be altered materially from that
hitherto adopted. In the place of the dull mechanical drudgery
which the pupil now passes through and which can only render
her tolerably proficient as far as the mere digital exercise on the
keyboard is concerned, music must be taught as other subjects
are taught, and “the reason why” must form an element in
the teaching In a word, the art and not the instrument
must form the basis of the lesson, and the pupil in learning to
play must also learn the language as well as the mere notes.
The every-day conversation in our drawing rooms, and the style
of music there supplied, prove that there is an immediate need
of reform in this respect, and one of the most practical
methods of imparting a knowledge of first principles is to bring
up every child in the practice of sight-singing, as when this is satis-
factorily and soundly taught, everything else will follow. Much
also may be done by our composers, our concert-givers, and our
artistes. Let them remember that they owe a duty to art as
well as to their pockets, and as a good painter would decline to
place his name on a carelessly executed picture which would

tarnish his reputation, so let the song-writers, the conductors, and
the vocalists remember that they have a very important duty to
fulfil, and that they can to a great extent guide the public taste.
It may be true, as we believe it is, that Englishmen lack in many
cases that innate power of distinguishing the true from the false
in music, which is such a striking characteristic of the Germans;
but there is always a tendency to ascribe to natural inferiority
that which ought more truly to be laid at the door of a defective
system of training. Thoroughly convinced are we that a deep
love for the art exists among the English people, and we look
forward with hope to the day when it will be generally culti-
vated by rich and poor. Its influence can only be for good, its
practice can only tend to make men better Christians and better
subjects, and he who wishes well to his country can adopt no
surer method of promoting her true welfare than by aiding to
the utmost of his power in this truly national work.

INDUSTRIAL RESULTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY.
ALThough the now familiar art of Photography may, to some
extent, be regarded as still in its infancy, its practical influence in
the realms of manufacturing industry has proved the reverse of
insignificant. Forty years ago, the process of taking pictures by
means of the sun's rays was regarded as little better than a
beautiful scientific experiment, too costly and difficult to possess
any chance of being frequently repeated. At the present time
it forms the regular occupation of some thousands of individuals,
not only in this country, but also on the continent, in the United
States, in Canada, and in Australia ; besides affording the means
of employment to yet larger numbers engaged in the many branches
of manufacturing industry, which the increasing practical appli-
cations of photography are continually calling into active exist-
It has been estimated that at the present moment the
photographic art, either directly or indirectly, provides employ-
ment for at least half a million persons in various parts of the
world. There are no means of verifying the correctness of this
estimate, but when we reflect on the enormous extent to which
photography is practised in the United States alone, where every
town has its photographic studio, not to mention those of the
large cities, the calculation does not seem at all excessive.
The real industrial value of photography dates from the dis-
covery of the collodion process in 1850. This formed the actual
starting point of the art. It rendered the taking of permanent
pictures comparatively easy and cheap, and caused the Daguerreo-
type and Talbotype to become things of the past. In the
daguerreotype process, the portraits were taken upon plates of
silver, or copper coated with silver. Despite their costly character
a very considerable trade arose out of the demand for these
ence.

plates, and large numbers of persons were employed in silvering
the surface of the copper, a process requiring great delicacy
and care.
But the leaden, death-like hue, peculiar to Daguerreo-
type portraits, a defect which not even the employment of
colours could wholly remove, caused a greater preference to be
shown to the Talbotype, in which paper was used instead of silver.
Moreover, while in the case of the Daguerreotype process the
portraits were reversed, as in a looking-glass, those taken by
Mr. Fox Talbot's method showed the object represented as it
really appeared to the eye. This was effected by means of the
picture being taken upon
waxed paper, which showed the lights
and shadows reversed. The picture thus obtained was called a
negative. The waxed paper, or negative, was then laid upon
another piece of prepared paper, and exposed to the action of
light, which, passing through the transparent portions of the
picture, caused them to become darkened on the second paper,
the opaque portions remaining untouched. The new picture
thus produced represented the lights and shadows as in nature,
and was called a positive. The use of waxed paper for taking
negatives has now become almost entirely superseded by the
employment of glass, the surface of which is prepared especially
for the purpose by one of the numerous existing modifications of
the albumen, or collodion processes, according to the tastes or
requirements of the photographer.
În the earlier sun-pictures the want of permanency was fre-
quently apparent. Not only were they costly, but they were no
sooner taken than they began to fade. This was particularly
noticeable in pictures produced by the Daguerreotype process,
which frequently disappeared from the surface of the silvered plate,
despite every precaution to protect it from injury. Nor were the
Talbotype pictures much more successful. No reliance could be
placed upon their stability. They might be almost perfect as
pictures, but their permanency was always doubtful. They
might endure for months, perhaps only for days ; but ultimately
they were certain to fade. To overcome this serious obstacle
long formed the great object of Mr. Fox Talbot and his fellow-
labourers in the new art. The defect arose from the instability
of the metallic salts employed, as explained by an experienced
writer in the “Popular Science Review," who informs us that :-
“The blacks of photographic prints on ordinary unsized paper
consist of silver. To aid in the proper fixing of a photograph, or
destroying its future sensitiveness to light, hyposulphate of soda
in solution is employed. The action of this salt on the silver in
the pores of the paper is of an extremely complex nature, and
long washing is requisite to secure its removal. If not thoroughly
removed, an action continues to be exerted which ultimately
results in the destruction of the picture, the blacks of which are
converted into a sulphide of silver. But the sulphurous gases
with which the atmosphere is impregnated, joined with the
complex effects produced by the albumen (with which photo-
graphic paper is usully prepared), acting on the silver in a

manner not yet clearly understood, exert a distructive influence
on photography. The introduction of gold toning has mitigated
this evil to a considerable extent; but an inspection of some
recent pictorial productions of photographers of reputation
suffices to show that it still exists, notwithstanding the known
care taken by them to obviate it.”
Still, the numerous improvements recently introduced into the
various photographic processes have done much towards giving
a permanent character to the productions of the camera.
We
have seen photographs, taken a few years ago, which seem as
clear and fresh as when they originally left the manipulator's
hands. Whether they will always remain so is a secret which
time alone can reveal, but the degree of durability which can
now be imparted to photographic pictures appears sufficient for
all ordinary purposes. The photographic art proper is most
largely employed in the production of cartes de visite and stereo-
scopic views. Of the former, several millions are annually
taken in this country alone. So great, indeed, is the number,
that more than one Chancellor of the Exchequer is said to have
considered the feasibility of materially adding to the National
income, by means of a small impost on these productions of
the photographer's studio. Who, in 1839, could have dreamed
that the almost simultaneous discoveries of Fox Talbot and
Daguerre would, within little more than a quarter of a century, not
only have furnished the means of employment to many thousands
of individuals, but also have suggested a new means of increas-
ing the public revenue ?
The popularity of the carte de visite arises from the singular
clearness and sharply defined portrait characteristic of this
description of photograph ; the small size of the picture employ-
ing only the centre of the lens. Dr. Wynter furnishes* several
interesting particulars respecting the demand for cartes de
visite. He states that their sale is now scarcely a fourth of
what it was when they first came into vogue. This, however,
may be the case with the large metropolitan establishments,
but in the provinces the rate of production appears to have
suffered no decrease ; on the contrary, the number of portraits
taken becomes larger each year. With regard to the sale of
cartes de visite of public characters, Dr. Wynter informs us that
it is still immense. Mr. Mayall, the well-known London Photo-
graphic Artist, who has taken the portraits of nearly all the
Royal Family, has received from Messrs. Marion, the photo-
graphic picture dealers, upwards of £35,000 for cartes de visite of
its various members. Indeed, the popularity of these portraits
has been something wonderful. When it was known that the
Princess Louise was to be wedded to the Marquis of Lorne, carte
de visite portraits of the illustrious couple appeared, as if by
magic, in all the photographic print shops throughout the king-
dom, and speedily found their way to America and Australia.
The London Stereoscopic Company sold many thousands of these

cartes, the demand for which still exists. The portraits of
favourite actresses command a very large sale, as do those of
popular statesmen, but it is difficult-save in exceptional cases-
to ascertain beforehand how far the carte of a new celebrity will
find favour with the public.
Stereoscopic views are prepared both on paper and glass, the
latter, although the most expensive, being far superior, by
reason of the delicacy and softness of the pictures which they
afford in the stereoscope. Transparent paper views, richly
coloured, also have a good sale, especially in France, where the
manufacture of this description of picture seems to be better
understood than in England. Stereoscopic views are divided
into two classes. The first consists of representations of land-
scapes, works of art, portraits, and so forth. The second class
comprises what may be termed reproductions of living pictures,
and illustrates the readiness with which the photographic art has
been turned to account in furnishing new means of remunerative
employment. Suppose, for instance, a stereoscopic view of “A
Music Lesson is required. A scene is prepared, as if for a
theatre; all the requisite accessories, such as pianoforte, chairs,
carpets, &c., are introduced ; and the living characters, appro-
priately attired, are carefully “posed.” The cost of getting up
one such scene is sometimes very great, but the expense is
generally covered by the sale of the pictures, as in the case of
that known as “ Little Red Riding Hood," which became very
popular. The preparation of the scenery for these stereoscopic
pictures sometimes forms a distinct occupation of itself, but it is
not so remunerative as it was a few years ago, when the stereo-
scope was a novelty: Stereoscopic views of actual landscapes
are always in demand. The list of these views is very extensive..
All the leading accessible places on the continent, in Asia,
Africa, America, and Australia, have found their way into the
stereoscope. We see the pyramids of Egypt, the mosques of
Constantinople, the rock temples of India, the Falls of Niagara,
the forests of Canada, the goldfields of Australia, the glaciers of
Switzerland, the ancient cities of Italy, the lochs of Scotland,
and the glens of Ireland brought before our eyes, as they
actually exist. It is nature itself, and thus the educational value
of Professor Wheatstone's discovery cannot be over-estimated. A
few stereoscopic views of scenes in Palestine afford us a more
vivid idea of the Holy Land than could be obtained from listen-
ing to half a dozen lectures. The stereoscopic views, or slides,
as they are more familiarly termed, are usually sold uncoloured,
save in the case of representations of living pictures; these
latter—as a rule—requiring a little colour, for the purpose of
heightening the effect. The slides are always uniform in size,
measuring 7 by 31 inches, but in France an attempt was recently
made to introduce a smaller description of slide measuring 4
by 2 inches. The experiment, however, proved a failure.
Photographic re-productions of celebrated pictures and en-
gravings are extremely numerous, and are of every imaginable
