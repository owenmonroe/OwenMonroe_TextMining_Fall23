he principal mountains of France are, 1. The 
 Toeget on the north-east. They are of a rounded oat- 
 Bne, with gentle slopes, and afford much open paa- 
 turage. The highest summit is not more than 4500 
 ftet nigh. 2. The Jura mountains He to the south of 
 these, and their summiu rise to the height of 0000 
 feet. 3. Many Alpine branches intersect Daaphlny 
 and Provence. In the ceotre of the kingdom are, 4. 
 The mountains of Auvergne, of volcamo origin, of 
 which the Puy de Dome, the Moots d'Or, and the 
 Cental, are the principal groups. 5. The Cerennee 
 Be to the south-east of the range last mentioned. 
 Their highest summit Is Mont Lozcre (about C510 
 Ihet). 0. The Pyrenees form the prlnnipai part of the 
 boundary between France and Spain. These moun- 
 tains divide the cou.utry into four great basins, the 
 form and exposure of which necessarily have a great 
 influence on their climate and productions. The nar- 
 row valley of the Rhine runs from nortli to <ioutIi, 
 while the open basins of the Seine, the Loire, and the 
 Garonne, stretch iu a north -weslt^rn direction. The 
 Adour rises in the Pyrenees, and washes the walls of 
 Bayonne. The other rivers are principally tributa- 
 jfes. The Marne and the Oise fall into tne Seine; 
 the Allier, the Loire, the Sarthe, and the Maycnne, 
 into the Loire ; the Rhone receives the Saoue, the 
 Isire, the Durance, the Ain, and the Sorgue ; the 
 Tarn and the Dordi^e join the Garonne. The nu- 
 merous branches of these rivers are joined by canals, 
 which form an extensive internal water communication. 
 
 In resprct to soil, the richest part of France is the 
 north-west division, comprehending the provinces of 
 Flanders, Artuis, Picardy, Normandy, and the Isle 
 of France, where there is a deep rich loam; about 
 18,I70,51>0 acres in extent. The valley of the Ga- 
 ronne ia composed of a friable sandy loam, with a 
 calcareous mixture, and moisture suthcient for every 
 purpose. This district contains 7)054,501 acres. The 
 greet valley of Languedoc is extremely prolific, though 
 the toil is not so fine as that of the preceding districts. 
 The Limarne, a valley of Auvergne, Is considered 
 to have one of the finest stjils in the world. It con- 
 atsts of beds of earth, said to be twenty feet deep, 
 formed from the deojmposition of soft basalt. The 
 calcareous and chalk formations are extensive. Tlie 
 chalk provinces are unfruitful in grain, but the genial 
 Influence of the sun allows them other riches. The 
 calcarroiis loam on the borders of the chalk formation 
 is more productive. In Bretagne, Anjou, and Maine, 
 are immense heaths. The lanite$ are J^xtensive tracts 
 of sandy deserts, producing nothing but broom, heath, 
 and Junipers. The most extensive are the landes of 
 Bordeaux, twenty leagues in length by twelve In 
 breadth. In the remaining provinces, gravel, or a 
 gravelly sand, is the predominating soil. The woods 
 and forests are estimated to oover a space of 10,795,000 
 acres. The principal are tlioseof Ardennes, Orleans, 
 and For.taincl'leau. The northern and western coasts 
 are formed iu a great proportion by immense downs 
 or sandbanks, and where the shores are formed by 
 cliffs, they are seidnrii bold enough to be approached 
 with safety. The harlwurs are therefore tew. On 
 the Mediterranean, the cout of Languedoc is very 
 dangerous, but Provence abuands in good barbourt. 
 The culture, throughout the northern half of the 
 kingdom, consists of wheat, barley, oats, pulsct *nd of 
 lata, much more than formerlv, of poutoes ; Iu (he

 and more ardent summers. Coal and iron are found 
 In abundance. The most common fuel is wood. 
 
 The superficial extent of France has been recently 
 estimated by Baron Dupin at 53,533,430 hecures, 
 or 139,094,000 English acres. The value of ca- 
 piul vested in agricultural pursuits Is estimated at 
 37.532,061,470 francs: the gross annual produce at 
 4,(>78,70R,805 francs ; the expenses of cultivation at 
 3,334,005,.'>15; leaving a profit of 31 per cent, on the 
 capital. The produce of wheat in the best cultivated 
 distrlcu, and on the best soil, hardly exceeds eighteen 
 bushels per acre : an English farmer exptcu twenty- 
 five or the same extent. In 1813, the number of 
 horstk A France was 9,170,000 ( but in 1810, the 
 horsMs and mules together amountad only to 1 }657,C7 1 ; 
 at present the number is estimated at 2,500,000. The 
 number of homed cattle Is 6,073,000 1 of sheep, about 
 45,0e^000. The total number of all kinds of poultry 
 is about 51,600,000. The French are tbe best wine- 
 makers in the world. The Champagne, Burgundy, 
 Claret, Hermitage, are drunk all over the world. For 
 a long time, the choicest growths were in the hands 
 of the church ; and in the frequent changes of pre 
 party which have taken place since the revolution, 
 many vineyards have deteriorated in consequ..noe of 
 bad management. The brandies of France are the 
 best in the world. The value of the whole produce of 
 V ine and brandy Is about 800,000,000 of fianos. The 
 culture of the vine Is supposed to have Increased nearly 
 one-fourth since the revolntion, owing principally to 
 the small proprietors, each of whom endeavours to 
 supply his own consumption by a little patch of vine- 
 yard. M. Dupin says that many hectarca of f ranch 
 territory are 3*01 uncultivated, merely for want of cat- 
 tle to stock und manure them ; that twcthirda of the 
 inhabitaattf are without aalmal food ; that more than 
 oue-third subsist entirely on oats, buckwheat, rye, 
 chestnuts, or potatoe0» and that the agricultural popu- 
 lation is loo great for the prosperity of France. Two- 
 thirds of the population is agrioulturaL 
 
 France possesses a soil and climate capable of fur- 
 nlahlng her with uil the raw materials of mauufactare 
 except cotton. The manufacture of fine woollen 
 cloths at Sedan wu introduced under the auspices of 
 Colbert. The machinery used was very defective un- 
 til M. Chaptal engaged an English machinist to In- 
 struct the French aruxans. Steam.engines are rare ; 
 the spinning mills being worked chiefly by water or 
 by horses. The quantity of native wool manufactured 
 in 1819.was 38,000,000 kilogrammes (of about 3|lbs. 
 each), and, in 1836, 4^,000,000, with H,000,000 of im- 
 ported wool : the value of the roanuiactured articles 
 was 305,000,000 francs ; of the raw wool, 105,000,000 : 
 the quantity exported was about one-thirteenth of the 
 whole quantity manufactured. By the exertions of 
 Henry IV., the mulberry.tree was cultivated in all the 
 southern provinces. At Tours, silk stuffs for furniture 
 are chiefly manufactured ; at Ganges, and other places 
 in the Cevennes, silk stockings. Lyons is the princi- 
 pal place for silk manufactures of all kinds. Paris 
 ranks next after Lyons. In 181'.!, the value of the 
 raw material amounted to 45,500,(HIO francs, of which 
 33,000,000 were the price of imported silk. The va- 
 lue of manufactured goods, at the same period, was 
 107,500,000 francs, m' which less than one-third was 
 exported. Forty years ago, the spinning of cotton by 
 machinery waa hardly practised in France. Cotton 
 mills have l>een established within that period, and 
 the manufactures of Alsace are now superior to those 
 of England in the brilliaucy of their colours. In 11113, 
 l0,:Ui3,000 kilogrammes of oitton were spun by ma- 
 chinery, and, iit 1H2A, 'JM,(M)0,000 of greater fineness. 
 The cambrics, gaiue, aiul lawn of St Quentin, Valen- 
 ciennes, and Cambray, are among the most valuable 
 products of French Industry. Lace is made in great 
 quantities. 
 
 The whole produce of the linen and hemp manu- 
 factures is estimated at 300,00(»,000 francs. L. 1814, 
 100,000,000 kilogrammes of cast-iron were produced ; 
 in 1825, 180,000,000. <IildinK tnd watch-making are 
 carried on, chiefly in Paris, t>> the annual value of 
 about 38,000,000 francs each. Printing also employs 
 a great number of persons at Paris. In IRU, the 
 number of printed sheets was 45,075,030; in 1820, 
 80,031,303 ; and in 1830, 144,58I,(MI4. NotwJth. 
 standing the low price of labour iu France, the in- 
 dustry of that c<iuntry cannot enter into competition 
 withUiatof England. One of the circumstances which 
 depress it is the want of internal communication by 
 roads and canals. The practicable roads of France 
 are not more than one-third of the extent of those of 
 England. The cross-roeds are few, and the great 
 roads are seldom kept in good order. The length of 
 the canals in France is not more than one- eleventh of 
 those of England. Another point in which France is 
 inferior is in the use of steam.engines, attributable In 
 part to the deficiency of coal, or the dlHiculty of trans- 
 porting it. The total force of steam-engines iu France, 
 according to Dupin, is ecpial to Jiat ol 480,(f(K> men ; 
 that of England is equal to a powei of li,44K),OlN) men. 
 All the power derived from machinery of every sort, 
 or from constructive ingenuity, and applied to pur- 
 poses of industry in France, is tinly one-fourth of the 
 similar power employed in England. 
 
 The commerce ot France has l>ecn vary ranch di- 
 minished by the loss of her colonies. The value of 
 the cokinial importa, in 1788, was 337,0tW,'i00 francs ; 
 iti 1834, it waa only 50,000,000. The exporu for

 The total value of exports from France, in 1834, was 
 440,543,000 francs t of which 103,050,000 were pro. 
 ductions of the country, and 277,486,000 manufactured 
 articles. The amount exported to the United States 
 waa 55,000,000, being more than that to any other 
 country. The imports for the same year were of the 
 value of 454,801,000 francs; of which 373,873,000 
 franoswerersw materials for manufacture, 121. 9r)7,000 
 natural productions for consumption, and 00,o:tO,000 
 manufactured articles. In 1824, the number of sailora 
 in French ships was 328,480 ; of whom 28,040 were 
 engaged in foreign commerce, 47,383 in the fisheries, 
 and the remainder in the coasting trade. The navy, 
 according to the budget of 1838, consisted of 38 ships 
 of the iioe, 35 frigates, 8 steam.boaU, and 186 other 
 veasels, and 14,003 officera and sailors. The army la 
 1828 amounted to 233,770 men, and was recruited by 
 voluntary enlistment and annual levies, every French- 
 man of twenty years of age being bound to serve for 
 a term of eight years. The reoelpu of 1828 were 
 l,037,iO4,4»l francs; the expenditure, 1,035,415,552 
 franos. 
 
 As we have glren the history of the French Revo- 
 lution of 1780 in another portion of the present work 
 (No. 9), nothing need here be said of that event. It 
 is suflident to state that the military character which 
 was engrafted upon the nation by subsequent eventa 
 still predominates, and may be described as one of the 
 main causes fur the deficiency of France in manufac- 
 tures, comn.eroe, wealth, and many comforts of social 
 life. The character of the Frei«oh, however. Is fwt 
 undergoing an improvement under the constitution 
 which the country has enjoyv.d since 1830, when 
 Louis Philip waa placed on the throne, by the events 
 of what are termed the " three days,** or the revolu- 
 tion which deposed the elder line of the Bourbons.
