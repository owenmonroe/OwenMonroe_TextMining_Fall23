Explanation of the column headed “ Thermometrical Register."
The Thermometrical Register commences with Nov. 1853, and closes with Oct. 1854,
inclusive. These registers have been carefully copied from those made at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, and which are also deposited with the Royal Society. They
show the highest and lowest ranges within each twenty-four hours, from twelve different
readings. Each month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most
ready and advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register
of the last two months of 1833 follows the ten months of 1854, which are all we can give
up to the day of publication.
Explanation of the columns headed “ Length of day.” “Day's increase or decrease,"
“Day breaks,” and “ Twilight ends."
The column headed “Length of day” contains the number of hours and minutes
between sunrise and sunset. The column headed “Day's increase
expresses the
number of hours and minutes which the day has increased since the shortest day; and,
where the column is headed “Day's decrease,” it expresses the number of hours and
minutes which the day has decreased since the longest day; for example, the length of
the longest day in 1853 is put down in the column “Length of day" at 16h. 34m.;
and on the 6th of July following we find that the length of the day, or the number of
hours and minutes between sunrise and sunset, is set down at 16h. 24m.; hence the
day has decreased 10m. since the longest day, and, accordingly, in the column “Day's
decrease,” we find opposite July the 6th Oh. 10m.
Equation of Time.
In this Almanac the calculations are all made for mean time (given by the clock),
instead of apparent time (given by the sun-dial), which latter had been used up to the
It must be obvious that, for all practical purposes, mean time is the most
useful; and to obtain it from apparent time, the columns in the Almanac headed

example, to be consulted when persons are desirous of setting their clock by a sun-dial.
When clock after sun is written above the number of minutes and seconds opposite to the
day, then the clock ought to be set so much slower than the sun-dial, and the contrary.

I. THE PROGRESS OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE
EARTH'S MOTION, BETWEEN THE TIMES OF CO-
PERNICUS AND GALILEO; BEING NOTES ON THE
ANTEGALILEAN COPERNICANS.
Any reader of the common accounts of astronomical history might
suppose that the moment Copernicus sowed the dragon's teeth, a
host of armed controversialists arose from out of the ground, and
proceeded to mutual slaughter. This arises from the manner in
which popular writers are naturally led to pass over an intervening
time, and to bring their readers at once to the story of Galileo and
the Inquisition. But when it is remembered that this period of ex.
citement begins with the construction of the telescope in 1609, and
that the work of Copernicus was published in 1543, it will appear
that there is a term of no less than 66 years during which the pro-
gress of opinion is to be accounted for. That is, the contemporaries
of Galileo looked back upon the announcement of the motion of the
earth just as we look back upon the commencement of the first
French revolution.
During this term of 66 years, the question was not, properly speak-
ing, discussed. Various writers gave opinions, but no book was
written against another book. Some leaned towards the actual
motion of the earth : some got no further than the armission of that
motion as a very simple anii efficacious way of deducing the plane-
tary motions. Some thought that the diurnal motion only could be
maintained : others were equally in favour of the motion round the
The difference between a physical and a mathematical use of the
Copernican or any other theory, is one which is rather puzzling to a
reader unaccustomed to such considerations. A mathematical
Copernican was one who saw that, come how it might, the heavenly
appearances are such as would take place if the earth did move about
the sun, and also about its own axis : and that, consequently, the
sun.

supposition of such motions, true or false, would be a convenient and
efficacious mode of explaining and predicting celestial phenomena.
A physical Copernican added to the above the belief that the reason
why things appear as they would if the earth had these motions, is
that it really has them. The first said that the hypothesis explains
or demonstrates phenomena; the second said that the hypothesis is a
true statement of the causes which produce phenomena.
Every person who knows the heavenly motions, as they appear
before our eyes, and has a little knowledge of geometry, must be a
mathematical Copernican : he cannot fail to see that a Copernican
universe would show the same appearances as that in which we live.
Accordingly, from the moment when the work of Copernicus ap-
peared, the beauty of the explanation was fully acknowledged, and
the author took his place at once among mathematicians of the first
order, both for his own novelties, and for his additions to the old
system. The highest terms of praise are found in the writings of
those who were most opposed to the physical truth of the hypothesis.
Those who were inclined to blame the novelty of the system-for in
every age the production of new opinions meets with reproach-had
their mouths stopped by reference to those among the ancients who
were known to have believed the actual motion of the earth.
It is said that Leonardo da Vinci held the motion of the earth, as
appears by his manuscripts, about 1500: but it does not appear that
he constructed any system of explanations. There was a work of
Calcagnini actually written and made known (divolgo, says Tiraboschi,
which we suppose does not imply printing) before that of Copernicus,
in which the earth's motion was defended: but as the author was
known to have travelled in Poland, where Copernicus had long been
teaching his system in every way except through the press, as well
as for other reasons, the Italians suppose he must have had know-
ledge of Copernicus and his opinions. In 1533, J. Albert Widman-
stadt, afterwards known as an oriental scholar, explained the views of
Copernicus before Clement VII., for which explanation that Pope
presented him with a Greek manuscript, which was preserved at
Monaco in the last century with an inscription by Widmanstadt
recording the gift and the reason.
We shall now give some detached accounts of the mode in which
the system presented itself to those whom we may term its Antega-
lilean supporters or opponents. The dates attached are those of
death, but all the writers belong to the sixteenth century.
Nicholas Copernicus (1543).—The question whether Copernicus
himself was a Copernican in the modern sense of the word is not
easily settled. His phraseology is almost always that of a mathema-
tical Copernican (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note 8). In a very few
places, and cautiously, he leans to the physical truth as probable,
and to the diurnal motion as more probable than the orbital. When
the Congregation of the Index, in 1620, propounded the alterations
under which they could allow his book to be read as a mathematical
hypothesis, they found those alterations very few in number : and,
though confessedly disposed to cancel the whole of Chapter VIII.,
as treating of the truth of the motion of the earth, they were never-
a

theless able to allow it to stand, because the author seemed to be
speaking problematically; whence they only imposed a few verbal al-
terations. Riccioli (Alm. N. ii. 294) affirms Copernicus to have been
a physical* Copernican, and cites the passages which, in his opinion,
prove it; but he does not feel able to get farther than the qualified
statement that Copernicus maintained the motion of the earth as
more probable, or even as demonstrated. The reader who can com-
pare the passages in the page cited with the alterations demanded by
the Congregation in p. 496, will be able to judge for himself: see
also the life of Copernicus in the Penny Cyclopædia.
George Joachim Rheticus (1576).--This celebrated friend of
Copernicus, and one of the principal instigators of his publication,
was himself the first announcer of the forthcoming system, in his
Narratio, &c., published in 1540_(Comp. 1853, p. 9). It may be
collected from this letter that Rheticus was, more than Coper-
nicus, inclined to express his belief in the motion of the earth as
an absolute truth. But the passages which prove this are im-
bedded in accounts of the manner in which the system explains
phenomena, and it would take more space than we can give to put
in evidencet the distinction between the phrases of Copernicus and
those of his herald. The following paragraph, however, will show
the manner in which the account struck another person.
Achilles Gassarus.—His letter (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note *),
written in 1540, upon receipt of a copy of the Narratio from his
friend Rheticus accompanied by a very full private letter, epistola
harum rerum refertissima, was printed at the head of the edition of
the Narratio referred to in the note just cited. No doubt this
private letter gave very explicit statement of the view actually taken
by Rheticus. Delambre (Astr. Mod. vol. i. p. 138) imagines that
it was the work of Copernicus himself which was sent to Gassarus ;
and concludes, from copies being thus issued three years before the
date of the book, that Copernicus delayed its publication even
after it was printed. But this is a mistake : we know perfectly well
that Copernicus never opened his own book, and received the only
copy he ever saw on the very day of his death. Gassarus describes
the publication of Rheticus as of novelty enough to stupefy any
one, as most contrary to the doctrines of the schools, and as what the
monks would certainly call heretical. He instances the motion of
the earth as among the wonders, but enters into no detail, apparently
because he sends on the work itself to his correspondent. We infer,
then, that Rheticus was a physical Copernican. This Gassarus was
the constructor of a series of almanacs, under the title of Prognosticon
a
a
* All the writers who make a similar affirmation in the sixteenth century are op-
ponents, except only Thomas Digges, who stoutly and expressly denies (in 1594) that
Copernicus meant his assertions “onely as mathematical principles fayned, and not as
philosophicall truely averred.”
+ Some give a very different account. In the Penny Cyclopædia (Rheticus), ap-
parently after Zedler, it is stated that this Narratio is ahsolutely written in opposition
to Copernicus," to show that the rotation of the earth about the sun is not a mere
probable hypothesis, as Copernicus had thought fit to announce it, but an incontestable
truth."
And many writers, though not going so far as this, are yet decided in their
statements that Rheticus was a physical Copernican, We arrive at the same opinion
with more difficulty.

Astrologicum. That for 1546 is dedicated to Rheticus, who, says
Gassarus, after the example of his master Copernicus, gave easier
introduction and clearer demonstration to the celestial motions. It
is probable enough that, next afier Rheticus, Gassarus was the first
who ventilated the name of Copernicus in print.
Erasmus Rheinhold (1553).—He was the friend of Copernicus,
and an abettor of the publication ; but his view was very different
from that of Rheticus. In his Prutenic (Prussian) tables, he makes
use of the observations of Copernicus, and he constructs tables of the
planets both on the old and on the Copernican data. He enters into no
discussion, and (according to Delambre) finds no occasion to speak
either of the motion of the earth or of the sun. It must be remarked
that several of the early Copernicans, whatever they might think of
the system physically or mathematically, found their chief source of
admiration in the changes which Copernicus made in the numerical
data of the planetary, and especially of the lunar, theory. These
numerical data might with ease have been transplanted into the Pto-
lemaic system. Rheinhold, then, so far as he declares himself, heads
the school of numericai Copernicans.
Peter Ramus (1572).—This celebrated leader of opinion is
reckoned rather among the philosophers than the mathematicians.
In the common language of our day, those who investigate matter
have usurped the name of philosopher, or rather, perhaps, have had
it usurped for them; while those who were once called philo-
sophers * are now usually called metaphysicians.
This is of no con-
sequence, t except in the confusion it creates: we shall in this
article use the term philosopher in its old sense. Ramus, a thorough
opponent of the old philosophy, began life, when he disputed at Paris
for his degree of master of arts, by offering to maintain the contrary
of any assertion whatsoever of Aristotle. His writings † were censured
by the University of Paris in 1543, the year in which Copernicus
published his great work. He was a correspondent of Rheticus, and
states (Sch, Math. book ii.) that he endeavoured by letter to per-
suade him to free astronomy altogether from hypothesis; and that if
Rheticus had not been obliged by circumstances to betake himself
to the practice of medicine, the mathematics might have had
another Copernicus to celebrate. Ramus, then, was for astronomy
without hypotheses, but with a very high opinion of Copernicus
and of his system as against previous ones ; so far his meaning is
not very clear. Mæstlinus took him literally, as advocating merely
7
* It must, however, he observed, that mind and matter were both subjects of the
ancient philosophy, physics being natural philosophy. The new school advocated
experimental pliilosophy, professing to draw all their conclusions from experiment.
The two terms were antagonists for some time; but at last they coalesced and for
more than a century writers and teachers have talked of natural and experimental
philosophy, a combination which still lingers in the prospectuses of schools and
lectures.
+ It is impossible to keep words to their meanings. The words physician and
naturalist are of the same original meaning, namely, investigators of the external
world; but the first now means a person who looks after the health of men, while the
second means one who looks after the classification, &c. of brutes and vegetabies.
# It is a coincidence of date worth noting, with reference to the attack on the old
system, that the astronomy of Copernicus and the logic of Ramus were published in
the same year.
