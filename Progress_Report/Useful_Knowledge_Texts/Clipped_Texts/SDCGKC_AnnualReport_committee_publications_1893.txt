 W E have much to rejoice us this year in the various departments of 
 our Society’s work. 
 
 Our Publications. 
 
 The Grace Examinations to commemorate the Empress Dowager 
 reaching the age of 60 were held simultaneously in September. It is a 
 high gratification to us to announce that through special funds, appealed 
 for to meet this special occasion, we succeeded in sending 6,000 of our 
 publications to each of the ten maritime provinces, making 60,000 in 
 all. 720,000 pages were thus distributed gratis, a number far in advance 
 of anything our Society has ever done before. 
 
 Another ambition of ours was the establishment of Branch Depdts 
 in the provinces for the sale of our Publications. We have now Depots 
 in Peking, in Moukden, in Tientsin, Shensi, in Nanking and in Chefoo, 
 with the small supply of $100 worth of literature in each to start with. 
 
 The work which will make this year most memorable however, is 
 the republication of Dr. Faber’s great work on Civilization , a book in 
 5 Chinese Volumes, and treating of all the leading forces of Western 
 Civilization. Thanks to the generosity of the Rev. P. Kranz we have 
 published an edition of two thousand copies, so that we shall be able 
 to present all the great Mandarins of the Empire with a copy each. 
 
 We have also republished the work which the late Dr. Williamson 
 was publishing when he died, viz: What a Nation Needs . This is at the 
 request of the members of the English Baptist Mission, who wish to 
 have it for circulation and who meet the expense of publication. But 
 the stereotyping of several of these works for future use has involved 
 considerable expense. 
 
 The book on the Benefits of Christianity has been sold out at its full 
 cost price, and a new edition has therefore been ordered.

 We have published Mr. George Jamieson’s Article on English Law 
 in China. The outline of the Rise and Progress of the Christian En¬ 
 deavour movement, now numbering millions of followers, published 
 in the Missionary Review , was republished by the United Society of 
 Christian Endeavour for China, and stereotyped by us. Dr. Faber’s 
 Chinese Theories of Human Nature is in press. Miss Harvie, Secretary of 
 the Ladies’ Society in Glasgow, has sent us a box of the beautiful 
 chrome of The Better Land , which will form the finest illustration ever 
 put out for Chinese homes. The Secretaries of the Christian Literature 
 Society in Glasgow have also sent us a fine collection of electros for 
 illustrating our magazines and books. The Progress of Surrounding 
 Nations ; Agricultural Chemistry ; the Value of the Doctrine of Immortality ; 
 Mrs. Foster on Persecutions in Madagascar and Christian Missions in the 
 South Sea, and Daily Readings also by her, have all appeared serially 
 in our periodicals and will be published separately. A Universal 
 History is being translated for our Society. Mackenzie’s Nineteenth 
 Century is also being translated; it will give much needed and most 
 valuable information regarding the latest progress of the nations of the 
 West. 
 
 Our Magazines. 
 
 Of the value of the Review of the limes we have had assurances from 
 Formosa and from Shantung in increased orders for it, and also in reprints 
 of some of our Articles in the Chinese Daily Papers. Of the value of 
 the Missionary Review we also have assurance in the fact that we had to 
 increase the number printed, and also in the frequent republication of 
 some of our Articles in other Chinese religious papers. In it we have 
 kept in mind the wishes of the Ladies’ Branch in Glasgow, who help 
 us so nobly, and have had much of its contents suited to give informa¬ 
 tion in the department they have chosen. But as it does not cover all 
 the objects they have in view, we must suspend its publication for a time 
 in order to publish the Women and Children’s Series ) unless we obtain 
 more funds immediately. 
 
 Dr. Allen’s Return. 
 
 Happily Dr. Allen, who has rendered such valuable service in 
 editing our Magazines, has now returned from his visit to the United 
 States, and will resume the editorial work in connection with which he 
 is so well and widely known.

 China’s Enormous Need of Enlightenment. 
 
 China’s losses and suffering for want of enlightenment are simply 
 appalling. 
 
 For want of political insight she had lost within the last 35 years 
 in N. E. Manchuria a country as large as France; and in the South 
 the tributary states of Ann am, which is now larger than France, and 
 Burma have passed from her control. 
 
 For lack of commercial knowledge she has 80 millions sterling less 
 foreign trade annually than India, she only doubles her trade during 
 the same time as Japan trebles hers, her tea trade rapidly declines for 
 want of adaptation to the changing needs of the market. Her banking 
 commission for transfer of money from one part of the country to 
 another is enormously high, and a million people are daily engaged in 
 the primitive way of weighing their silver and counting their cash. 
 
 For lack of economical means of transport, China fails to obtain the 
 enormous benefits which the West reaps from this source. Mulihall 
 estimates the annual gain to Europe from railways alone at no less than 
 1,200 millions sterling ! As the Chinese Empire is in area and popula¬ 
 tion about the same as Europe, what she misses for want of these is 
 evidently immense. 
 
 For lack of scientific and engineering training the many millions 
 of pounds sterling which each nation in the West gains annually from 
 these, are not within the reach of any educated Chinamen as yet. 
 
 For lack of sound knowledge in practical philanthropy among her 
 very numerous religious teachers—priests and nuns—the great benefit 
 that might be derived from such a large number is not reaped. 
 
 The result of general ignorance on such lines as indicated is the 
 great poverty of the nation as a whole. While many are rich, the great 
 mass is in terrible poverty. The poor, again, have to pay 36 per cent, 
 to pawnshops, and 1U0 per cent, often in order to tide over temporary 
 difficulties. Thousands upon thousands collect in mat sheds at every 
 great city in the winter in order to attend the free soup kitchens there. 
 This practically amounts to slow starvation. Thus China presents such 
 an amount of suffering as far surpasses that of any other country. Yet 
 most of it might be easily removed.

 Some of the most enlightened Chinamen who read our Periodicals 
 regularly, see this and know some of the remedies to he applied. 
 Railways are now sanctioned to be worked in Tientsin : cotton factories 
 and steel works are introduced in Shanghai and Hankow, so that the 
 people of China may partake of their benefits. But the remedies are 
 very slow in their application, and the great bulk of even the mandarins 
 are not only utterly ignorant of their being the greatest sufferers on 
 earth, but complacently congratulate each other that they belong to the 
 only Celestial Empire on earth ! Few among them suspect that our 
 little Society possesses the knowledge by which these gigantic evils — 
 material, moral and spiritual—can be remedied. But we do know the 
 remedies, and by organized efforts we are determined to make them 
 known throughout every corner of this vast Empire. Some day those 
 who read our periodic and systematic treatment of their ills, will, in 
 China as elsewhere, understand our motives and bless us for our work. 
 Meanwhile we have the conviction that by helping the Chinese who are 
 in need of enlightenment, we are helping to lessen the sum total of 
 suffering from the face of the earth, we are opening the way for 
 development on all sides in every province, and greatly strengthening 
 the hands of all the best in the land. The grand record of history 
 which the Chinese possess in the past is assurance of a glorious future 
 for them. It is our privilege to be of service to them in this their hour 
 of great need, and to give them the advice of true friends.
