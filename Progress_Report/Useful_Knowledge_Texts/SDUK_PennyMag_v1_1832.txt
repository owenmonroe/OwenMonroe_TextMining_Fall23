PREWACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.
MERICA
The unparalleled sale of the “ PENNY Magazine” . the United Kingdom, as well as the highly valuable,
interesting, and useful information contained in the work, induced the Proprietor of this edition to make arrang
ments with the Publisher in London, for a new and complete set of Stereotype Plates to be cast from the original
edition. These plates have nearly all arrived, and the Second Volume is now in course of publication.
This undertaking is attended with the sake dificulties and expenses, so fully pointed out in the following Preluce
to the English edition, and to which we would refer our numerous readers. It has also to contend with several
imitations compiled principally from its pages, none of which, however, have yet equalled it in the extent of
matter, or the beauty and number of the engravings. The “ Penny Magazine” is sold either in Numbers, at
Two Cents each, or in Monthly Parts, to which are added Supplements, at Twelve and a Half Cents : the purchaser
thus receives Sixty-four Numbers for One DOLLAR AND A Half; while the most successful of the works of
a similar nature, published in the United States, furnishes only Twenty-six numbers (containing less matter in each)
for a subscription of One Dollar.
Without the aid of Machinery,—which has arrived in this country to great perfection, especially in the art of
printing--the "Penny MAGAZINE” could not be published at its present price ; and even with this aid, it
must have a large circulation, to cover the heavy charges attending its progress through the press and
distribution throughout this extensive country

PREFACE.
Upon the completion of the First Volume of the “ Penny Magazine," it may not be inexpedient to offer a
few observations to the purchasers of this little work, whose sale has been justly regarded as one of the most
remarkable indications of the extent to which the desire for knowledge has reached in the United Kingdom.
It was considered by Edmund Burke, about forty years ago, that there were eighty thousand readers in this
country. In the present year it has been shown, by the sale of the “ Penny MAGAZINE,” that there are two
hundred thousand purchasers of one periodical work. It may be fairly calculated that the number of readers of
that single work amounts to a million.
If this incontestable evidence of the spread of the ability to read be most satisfactory, it is still more satisfactory
to consider the species of reading which has had such an extensive and increasing popularity. In this work there
has never been a single sentence that could inflame a vicious appetite ; and not a paragraph that could minister to
prejudices and superstitions which a few years since were common. There have been no excitements for the
lovers of the marvellous—no tattle or abuse for the gratification of a diseased taste for personality, ind, above all,
no party politics. The subjects which have uniformly been treated have been of the broadest and simplest
character. Striking points of Natural History-Accounts of the great Works of Art in Sculpture and Painting-
Descriptions of such Antiquities as possess historical interest - Personal Narratives of Travellers Biographies
of Men who have had a permanent influence on the condition of the world—Elementary Principles of Language
and Numbers-established facts in Statistics and Political Economy—these have supplied the materials for exciting
the curiosity of a million of readers. This consideration furnishes the most convincing answer to the few (if any
there now remain) who assert that General Education is an evil. The people will not abuse the power they have
acquired to read, and therefore to think. Let them be addressed in the spirit of sincerity and respect, and they will
prove that they are fully entitled to the praise which Milton bestowed upon their forefathers, as "a nation not slow
and dull, but of a quick, ingenious, and piercing spirit,- acute to invent, subtile and sinewy to discourse, not
beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capa' ity can soar to.”
It must not, however, be forgotten, that some of the une rimpled success of this little work is to be ascribed to
the liberal employment of illustrations, by means of wood-cut. At the commencement of the publication, before
the large sale which it has reached could at all have been contemplated, the cuts were few in number, and
partly selected from another work of the Society—the “ Library of Entertaining Knowledge.” But as the public
encouragement enabled the conductors to make greater exertions to give permanency to the success which the
" Penny Magazine” had attained, it became necessary to engage artists of eminence, both as draughtsmen and
wood-engravers, to gratify a proper curiosity, and cultivate an increasing taste, by giving representations of the
finest Works of Art, of Monuments of Antiquity, and of subjects of Natural History, in a style that had been pre-
viously considered to belong only to expensive books. In the prosecution of this undertaking there have been great
mechanical difficulties. The wood-cuts, as well as the text, are transferred to stereotype-plates--and the impres-
sions are rapidly printed from these plates by machinery. In this process there can of course be no delicate and
careful adjustment, such as is found necessary in printing wood-cuts by the common press. The average number
of the “ PENNY Magazine," printed daily from two sets of stereotype-plates, is sixteen thousand, on both sides ;
-at the common printing press, one thousand impressions, on both sides, can only be obtained, even where
particular care is not required. Seeing, therefore, that the speed with which the “ Penny MAGAZINE" is printed,
is sixteen times greater than in ordinary printing, some indulgence must be made for defects in the wood-cuts, as
they appeared in a few of the early numbers. Those defects have been now almost entirely overcome, by the
talent of the engravers, adapting their art to a new process.
It may not be uninteresting to mention two or three fucts here, which may possibly be more systematically and
fully pointed out here:fier, for the purpose of showing that such a work as the “ Penny MAGAZINE” could not
exist in its present state—and its present state is dependent upon its large sale~except in a country where civili-
zation is carried forward to very high degrees of perfection. The vast number of the existing race of readers,
to which we have already alluded, might be supposed sufficient to warrant this assertion : but let us examine ta
little more in detail

PREFACE

We see,
a
The number of the “ Penny MAGAZINE” which the reader is now perusing will be left ready to be printed off-
to “go to press” as it is technically termed—on the 19th of December. Its previous preparation will have
employed writers and artists, and that class of printers called compositors, for several weeks. The paper for
160,000 copies (the quantity required for the consumption during the first month after publication), consisting of
160 double reams (each sheet printing two copies,) will have been previously delivered from the mill, and will have
been charged with the excise duty of 3d. in the lb. upon 5,600 lbs.—the tax upon that quantity amounting to 701.
Up to this point a great deal of technical knowledge and mechanical skill will have been employed. Chemical
knowledge and machinery are indispensable in the manufacture of the paper; and without the very ingenious
invention of Stereotype Founding, in which great practical improvements have been made within a few years, the
** Penny MAGAZINE” could not be printed in duplicate, which diminishes the expense, nor could the supply be
proportioned to the demand. As we have already explained, the printing machine begins its work when every
preparation is complete. In ten days one machine produces 160,000 copies from two sets of plates. If the
printing machine had not been invented it would have taken a single press, producing a thousand perfect copies
each day, one hundred and sixty days, or more than five calendar months, to complete the same number.
therefore, that up to this point there are many conditions for the production of a Penny Magazine which could
not exist except in a high state of civilization, where there were large accumulations of knowledge.
This Number of our periodical work, which thus goes to press on the 19th of December, will be sold in every
part of the United Kingdom, generally on the 1st of January,—in remote distriots, on the 3d or 4th at latest. No
one who wishes for a copy of this Magazine, whether in England, Scotland, or Ireland, can have any difficulty in
getting it if he can find a bookseller. The communication between the capital and the country, and between large
towns in the country and villages, is now so perfect, that wherever there is a sufficient demand of any commodity
there will be a supply. But the “ Penny MAGAZINE” is still a Penny Magazine all over the country. No one
charges three-halfpence or twopence for it. The wholesale dealer and the retailer Iderive their profit from the
publisher; and the carriage is covered by that profit. But that could not be if there were not cheap as well as
ready communication through all parts of the United Kingdom. The steamboat upon the seas—the canal-the
railway—the quick van—these, as well as the stage-coach and mail—place the “ PENNY MAGAZINE” within every
one's reach in the farthest part of the kingdom, as certainly as if he lived in London, and without any additional
cost. This is a striking illustration of the civilization of our country; and when unthinking people therefore ask,
what is the benefit of steam-engines, and canals, and fine roads to the poor man, they may be answered by this
example alone. In this, as in all other cases, ready and cheap communication breaks down the obstacles of time
and space,—and thus bringing all ends of a great kingdom as it were together, greatly reduces the inequalities of
fortune and situation, by equalizing the price of commodities, and to that extent making them accessible to all.
Some people have foolishly said that the “ Pen vy MAGAZINE” is a monopoly. There were formerly a great
many monopolies of literature in this country that is, certain privileges were granted by the government to par-
ticular individuals, with the intent of diminishing the circulation of books by keeping up the price. Then the
government was afraid that the people would learn to think. The object of those concerned in the “PENNY
MAGAZINE” is, contrary to the spirit of monopoly, to circulate as many copies as they can, as cheaply as they can.
This Work has no exclusive privileges, and can have no exclusive privileges. It stands upon the commercial
principle alone; and if its sale did not pay its expenses, with a profit to all concerned in it (except to the individual
members of the Society who give it the benefit of their superintendence), it would not stand at all. The Society
has no funds to assist the “ PENNY MAGAZINE ;" for its subscriptions are scarcely sufficient to defray the rent of
the chambers in which it holds its meetings. But the “ PENNY MAGAZINE” contributes materially to the funds
of the Society, which funds are ready to be devoted to new undertakings, where success may not be so assured.
The public, who buy the “Penny Magazine” to the extent of two hundred thousand, are its only pecuniary
supporters. It is the duty of those who receive this Jarge encouragement to carry forward their work to as high
point of excellence as they may attain by liberal and judicious arrangements.

recommended by the ticket of a proprietor. It is not our
intention to give a description of all the various animals
there; but we shall from time to time notice any remark-
able circumstance that occurs, as illustrative of their
habits; or we shall mention any new curiosity which is
purchased by the Society, or presented to it.
The Wapiti, in the Zoological Gardens, shed his im.
mense horns on the 6th of February last. Their weight
was twenty-one pounds five ounces. In 1831 he shed
them on the 1st of February, when their weight was
twenty-three pounds two ounces. In captivity, therefore,
the Wapiti shows no deviation from the law of nature,
which he exhibits in his own American forests,—that he
should shed his horns, or bony excrescences, every year.
All the deer tribe are subject to this law. Already the
new horns of the Wapiti are beginning rapidly to grow-
at first looking like a soft velvety substance, and
gradually getting harder and more branching, till they
become the gigantic antlers, which within a year will
drop off, again to be renewed. It is generally con-
sidered that the horns of the deer tribe increase in size
as the animal advances in age ; but in the individual
instance of the Wapiti of the Zoological Gardens, the
horns of 1832 weigh less, by one pound thirteen ounces,
than those of 1831.

THE SWALLOW.
The swallow, and other birds of passage—that !s,
birds who fly from one country to another, as the weather
becomes unsuited to their natures-- now begin to return
to us. The swallow is a general favourite. He comes
to us when nature is putting on her most smiling aspect,
and he stays with us through the months of sunshine
and gladness. “The swallow," says Sir H. Davy, "is
one of my favourite birds, and a rival of the nightin-
gale ; for he glads my sense of seeing, as much as the
other does my sense of hearing. He is the joyous
prophet of the year, the harbinger of the best season ;

And raise pleasure to her height,

people were accustomed to make a procession, bearing
boughs of blossoming willow as most resembling the
fan-like branches of the palm. An old writer on plants
says, speaking of willow, “ The blossoms come forth
before any leaves appear, and are in their most flourish-
ing estate usually about Easter, divers gathering them
to deck up their houses on Palm-Sunday; and therefore
the said flowers are called Palm.” The date-palm is in
many respects one of the most valuable trees of the East,
affording sustenance to an immense population, and
cheering a sterile region by its beauty.


THE MOLE.
The Moles are beginning to throw up the earth, and
to destroy the herbage of the light soils. What an extra-
ordinary animal is the mole! We constantly see his
traces of destructiveness, but how difficult is it to track
him to his hiding-place.
And no wonder : his excava-

The sugar-cane varies exceedingly in its growth,
depending upon the nature of the soil. In new and
moist land it sometimes attains the height of twenty
feet. It is always propagated from cuttings. The
hoeing of a cane-field is a most laborious operation
when performed, as it must be, under the rays of a
tropical sun. Formerly this task was always effected
by hand labour, but, of late years, where the nature of

of canes does not require to be renewed annually; in
such a case the utmost number of labourers now em-
ployed on a sugar plantation would be wholly inadequate
to its performance.
When the canes are fully ripe they are cut close to
the ground, and being then divided into convenient
lengths, are tied up in bundles, and conveyed to the
mill. The canes, on being passed twice between the
cylinders of this mill, have all their juice expressed.
This is collected in a cistern, and must be immediately
placed under process by heat to prevent its becoming

INSTRUCTION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB.
The sixth number of · The Quarterly Journal of Edu-
cation,' just published, contains a very interesting paper
on the curious subject of instructing the deaf and dumb.
Most persons are greatly puzzled to know how a child,
that can neither hear nor speak, can be taught to read
and write, and express the most complex ideas. Some
of this wonder may be perhaps removed by the following
account of the method pursued by the Abbé Sicard, in
establishing a connexion in the mind of a pupil between
an object and a word :-
“ Sicard placed before the learner various familiar
objects, drawing them at the same time before his eyes
on a board. He is then taught to point to the object
on being shown the picture. He now tries his own
skill in drawing, and is delighted to find that he also is
understood by others. When the relation between the
actual object and its picture has been well established,
the letters of the alphabet are written in a corner of the
board, and the pupil is desired to take notice of them.
The name of the object is then written round its picture,
This is a great mystery to the pupil, and his astonishment
is increased when the instructor rubs out the picture,
leaving only the letters. While the pupil is wondering
what this may mean, the instructor shows the letters to
a third person, who immediately selects a corresponding
object from among a number. This process is repeated,
and the student himself is allowed to find, that when
he draws the same uncouth characters, he is equally suc-
cessful in directing the attention of a third person to the
object, and this also when he places the letters in one
horizontal line. He is then made to find out this effect

OF THS
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
March 31 to April 30, 1832.
The Penny Magazine will, in most cases, be delivered weekly in the Towns of the United Kingdom, by Booksellers and Newsvenders,
to whom Subscribers should address their Orders. It cannot be sent by Post as a Newspaper is, being unstamped. For the convenience
of those, who, residing in country places, cannot obtain the Publication at regular weekly intervals, the Numbers published during each
Month will be stitched together to form a Monthly Part. That this Part may be sold at a convenient and uniform price, a MONTHLY
SUPPLEMENT, consisting, for the most part, of Accounts of New Public Works, Abstracts of important Reports of Public Institutions, and
of Notices of such New Books as we think right to give a place to in “the Library,” will appear with the regular Number on the last
Saturday in the Month. The price of the Part, whether consisting of five or of six Numbers, will be SIXPENCE ; each Part will be neatly and
strongly done up, in a wrapper. Thus, the annual Espense of Twelve Parts will be Six Shillings, viz.: Fifty-two Regular Numbers, 45.4d.;
Twelve Supplements, 1s.; Twelve Wrappers, 8d.—Total, 6s.

Some of the most important vegetable productions which
we. possess have been naturalized amongst us by the
experiments of horticulture; and in the same way it is
natural to conclude that great improvements in the
races of our domestic animals may be effected. At the
Zoological Society's farm at Kingston, a considerable
number of quadrupeds and fowls are kept for the pur-
pose of rearing stock; and already some very useful
facts have been ascertained, which promise an increase
of the number of animals which can be applied to the
service of inan, as well as an improvement upon those
which we have already domesticated. For instance, it
is expected that the breed from the zebra and the
common ass may give us a more hardy and powerful
beast of draught than we already possess. Upon this
particular the Report says :-

government laid a tax upon the sale of the beverage,
which produced a considerable revenue.

Turkey, and this fact may be in a great measure ac-
counted for by the strict prohibition which the Moslem
religion lays against the use of wine and spirituous
liquors. So necessary was coffee at one time considered
among the people, that the refusal to supply it in reason-

Omai, the native of one of the Friendly Islands, who
is thus beautifully apostrophized by Cowper, acted as
interpreter to Captain Cook in his third voyage round
the world. His natural quickness and his fidelity ren-
dered him of considerable use to our great navigator in
his intercourse with the natives of the South Seas. Omai
was brought by Cook to England, where he was treated
with much kindness, and introduced into the best society.
The ease and even elegance of his manners was an object
of surprise ;-but almost all the uncivilized people of
this part of the world, and more especially the New Zea-
landers, have exhibited the same natural respect for the
opinions and feelings of others which is the foundation of
real politeness. Dr. Johnson speaks of Omai as showing

a
The Arabs are the greatest consumers of butter in the
world, Burckhardt tells us, that it is a common practice
among all classes to drink, every morning, a cupful of
melted butter or ghee; and they use it in an infinite
varieij of other ways. The taste for it is universal and
even the poorest individua's will spend half their daily
income that they may have butter for dinner, and butter
in the morning. Large quantities are annually shipped
from Cosseir, Sonakin, and Massona, on the west coast
of the Red Sea, for Djidda and other Arabian ports.
We shall notice in our Supplementary number for
this month the very valuable publication, M'Culloch's
Dictionary of Commerce, from which the above account
is extracted.

The various circumstances attending the introduction
and use of butter in antiquity, have been investigated
by Beckmann with great learning and industry. The
conclusion at which he arrives is, “that butter was
not used either by the Greeks or Romans in cooking,
as is everywhere customary at present. We never find
it mentioned by Galen or any other ancient medical
writer, as food, though they have spoken of it as appli-
cable to other purposes. No notice is taken of it by
the Roman epicure, Apicius, who wrote on cookery;
nor is there anything said of it in that respect by the
authors who treat of agriculture, though they have given
us very particular information with respect to milk,
cheese, and oil.
"This, as has been remarked by others, may be easily
accounted for, by the ancients having accustomed them.

but a mistake of Norden, a Danish traveller who visited
Egypt in 1737. He then saw this statue in its entire
state, seated on a chair, in precisely the same attitude as
the black breccia figure, No. 38, but lying with its face
on the ground; to which accident indeed the preserva-
tion of the features is no doubt mainly due. Several
ancient writers, and among them the Greek Geographer
Strabo, speak of a large temple at Thebes on the west
side of the Nile, to which they gave the name of the
Memnonium, or Memnon's temple. Norden fancied
that the building, amidst whose ruins he saw this statue,
was the ancient Memnonium ; though he supposed,
that another statue of much larger dimensions than this
in the Museum, and now lying in numerous fragments
in the same place, was the great Memnon statue, of
which some ancient writers relate the following fact
that at sun-rise when the rays first struck the statue, it
sent forth a sound something like that of the snapping
of the string of a lute.
It is now generally admitted that the real statue of
Memnon is neither the large one still lying at Thebes
in fragments, nor this statue in the Museum, which
came out of the same temple—but another statue still
seated in its original position on the plain of Thebes,

sembles in all respects the great colossus with the in-
scriptions on its legs, and it has also the name of
Memnon written on it and enclosed in an oblong ring, on
each side of the front part of the seat; and also on the
back.
If this colossus in the Museum (No. 66) was entire
in 1737, it may be asked how came it to be broken?
We cannot say further than the following statement :-
Belzoni, whose name must be fresh in the recollection
of most people, went to Egypt in 1815, intending to
propose to the Pasha some improved mechanical con-
trivances for raising water from the river in order to irri-
gate the fields. Owing to various obstacles this scheme
did not succeed, and Belzoni determined to pay a visit
to Upper Egypt to see the wonderful remains of its
temples. Mr. Salt, then British Consul in Egypt, and
Lewis Burckhardt, commissioned Belzoni to bring this
colossal head from Thebes. Belzoni went up the river,
and landing at Thebes found the statue exactly in the
place where the Consul's instructions described it to be
It was lying "near the remains of its body and chair,
with its face upwards, and apparently smiling on me at
the thought of being taken to England.
I must say
that my expectations were exceeded by its beauty, but
not by its size. I observed that it must have been abso-
lutely the same statue as is mentioned by Norden, lying
in his time with the face downwards, which must have
been the cause of its preservation. I will not venture to
assert who separated the bust from the rest of the body
by an explosion, or by whom the bust has been turned
face upwards."
It will be observed that the left shoulder of this
figure is shattered, and that there is a large hole drilled
in the right shoulder. We believe both are the work of
the French who visited Thebes during the occupation of
Egypt by the French army in 1800 ; and there is no
doubt that Belzoni in the above extract means to attri-
bute to them the separation of the head and shoulders

tions; yet all of them admit a fine polish. The colossal
head, No. 8, opposite to the Memnon, and No. 2, com-
monly called an altar, will serve to explain our meaning.
This Memnon's bust consists of one piece of stone,
of two different colours, of which the sculptor has ju-
diciously applied the red part to form the face. Though
there is a style of sculpture which we may properly call
Egyptian as distinguished from and inferior to the
Greek, and though this statue clearly belongs to this
Egyptian style, it surpasses as a work of art most other
statues from that country by a peculiar sweetness of
expression and a finer outline of face. Though the eye-
brows are hardly prominent enough for our taste, the
nose somewhat too rounded, and the lips rather thick, it
is impossible to deny that there is great beauty stamped
on the countenance. Its profile, when viewed from va-
rious points, will probably show some new beauties to
those only accustomed to look at it in front.
The position of the ear in all Egyptian statues that
we have had an opportunity of observing is very pecu-
liar, being always too high; and the ear itself is rather
large. We might almost infer that there was some
national peculiarity in this member from seeing it so in-
variably placed in the same singular position. The
appendage to the chin is common in Egyptian colossal
statues, and is undoubtedly intended to mark the beard,
the symbol of manhood : and it may be observed not
only on numerous statues, but also on painted reliefs,
where we frequently see it projecting from the end of
the chin and not attached to the breast, but slightly
curved upwards. Osiris, one of the great objects of
Egyptian adoration, is often thus represented; but the
beard is generally only attached to the clothed figure,
being, for the most part, but not always, omitted on
naked ones. The colossal figures, No. 8 and 38, have
both lost their beards. There is a colossal head in the
Museum, No. 57, that is peculiar in having the upper

brown bread while he can get white, unless he like the
brown the best ; nor drink small beer while he can get
strong, unless he like the small the best. These are
mummeries of a past age, when boisterous merriment
was mistaken for happiness. The more the under-
standing is cultivated the more do we acquire a taste for
quiet and unexpensive pleasures ;--and whilst we have
fields and green lanes, such as Highgate offers, to
wander through, and can know how to derive pleasure
and instruction from the contemplation of “ the meanest
floweret of the vale," we may well forego the unmeaning
shouts which once attended the general practice of
being “sworn at Highgate,” happy to have escaped the
expense and the headaches which waited upon those
fooleries, kept up by interested hosts and their idle and
drunken hangers-on.


[Highgate Church.)
Those of our readers who take their “ holiday walks"
in the northern environs of London--and more delight-
ful walks cannot be presented by the suburbs of any city
in the world—will have observed, that in the course of
last autumn, a tall Gothic spire had sprung up on the
summit of Highgate-hill. This is the spire of Highgate
church, which has been just completed, and which is
an honourable monument of the taste of Mr. L. Vulliamy,
its architect. It is impossible to imagine a more beau-
a
tiful site than that chosen for the church, or a style of
building better adapted to the situation. The interior is
extremely neat and commodious. The old Chapel of
Ease, which stands near the Gate-house, was a very
small and inconvenient place of worship.
Those who take a summer ramble to Highgate, to
see this new church, need not now apprehend that they
shall be compelled to be “sworn on the horns,” if they

The Europeans of the seventeenth century had con-
ceived the principle of suspension bridges, and such a
structure is described by Scamozzi, an Italian architect,
in his work Del Idea Archi, published in 1615. Eighty
years ago, the English threw over the Tees, at Winch,
near Durham, a bridge of iron-wire, which served for
foot-passengers. In the beginning of the present cen-
tury, by means of chains placed close to each other,
carrying cross-beams and planks laid longitudinally, we
constructed bridges, over which workmen might pass
with loaded wheelbarrows. Such were the bridges esta-
blished on iron chains, and thrown from one eminence
to another, for the purpose of carrying away the earth

diminish in proportion to improvements in agricultural machines,
and other means of economising labour. All the children, therefore,

It is affirmed, by two correspondents, that the first stone
of New London Bridge was laid on the 15th June, and not
on the 27th April, 1825.
The belief that if a funeral be carried along a path a right
of way is established, is not less a popular error because
the experiment was tried and yielded to at Woolwich.
A writer suggests that the slow increase of populatior.
in some agricultural districts, mentioned in Statistical
Notes,' No. 1, may be thus accounted for :
“ The purely agricultural districts do not increase their population,
because a certain quantity of land requires only a definite number of
labourers, and this number, instead of increasing, has a tendency to
diminish in proportion to improvements in agricultural maclunes,
and other means of economising labour. All the children, therefore,
which are born in these districts, above the mumber required to replace
their parents, &c., move off to towns and other places where employ-
ment can be obtained ; and the slow increase, noticed in their popu-
lation, depends on a coresponding increase in capital and income.”

OBELISKS.
THE BRITISH MUSEUM.-No. 3. ! the height of this fragment is about 8 feet lf inch, mea-
sured along one of the faces.
These two obelisks have a great number of figures
cut on each face, representing either natural objects,
such as birds and serpents, or various other things
which it is not in all cases easy to identify. They are
cut deep into the stone, and, in some instances, a con-
siderable elevation or relief is given to the parts contained
within the deep incision, for the purpose of showing the
IIX
round and prominent parts of the figure. On all Egyp-
tian monuments of an early age, animals are cut with
great accuracy of outline and spirit, especially birds, of
which this obelisk offers some excellent specimens in the
goose, the ibis, known by his long beak and legs, and
another bird in walking attitude, near the base of the south
side. The execution of this last is above all praise.
It is now ascertained that the figures enclosed in ob-
long rings contain the titles and names of kings. These
are the same on the two obelisks, and they happen also
to be the same as those on the great sarcophagus, No. 6.
There have been many disputes among the learned
bit
as to the origin and meaning of obelisks, into which we
shall not enter here. We know that they were gene-
rally placed in pairs at the entrances of the great Egyp-
tian temples and palaces ; and there are still two stand-
ing, in their original position, before the gateway of a
large edifice at Thebes. When the Romans got pos-
session of Egypt, Augustus removed two of the largest
obelisks from Heliopolis (the city of the sun) to Rome,
where they still exist, and attest the fact of their removal
at that period, by a Latin inscription on the pedestal.
During the troubles of the city and the disastrous period
of the decline of the Roman Empire, these and other
obelisks were thrown down and broken; but they have
since been set on pedestals by the enterprising spirit of
some of the popes. Sixtus V., in 1586, set the first
example, in which he was followed by several of his suc.
cessors ; and Pius VI. restored other obelisks in the
years 1786, 1789, and 1792. Two have been raised
since the last-mentioned date.
The largest obelisk now at Rome, and perhaps the
largest in the world, is that which stands in front of the
Lateran church. . It was originally erected by the Em-

THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOW-WORM. State of Europe in the Dark Ages.-In less than a cen-

which the Romans had spread through Europe, disappeared.
Not only the arts of elegance, which minister to luxury,
and are supported by it, but many of the useful arts, without
which life can scarcely be considered as comfortable, were
neglected or lost. Literature, science, and taste, were words
little in use during the ages which we are contemplating;
or, if they occur at any time, eminence in them is ascribed to

In order to form a correct judgment of a picture, it is
necessary to bear in mind the school to which the master
belonged ; for the different schools of painting were
influenced by very different views, and are appreciated
for various excellences, frequently of an opposite cha-
racter. The masters of the Roman and Florentine
schools turned their attention almost exclusively to the
merits of design : their works are recommended to us by
correct and powerful drawing, grace and beauty of form,
sublime conception, and well-defined expression and
character. Minor attractions are neglected: if we find

SINGULAR DEXTERITY OF A GOAT.
With passions unruffled, untainted with pride,
By reason my life let me square ;
The wants of my nature are cheaply supplied,
And the rest are but folly and care.
The blessings which Providence freely has lent,
I'll justly and gratefully prize ;
Whilst sweet meditation and cheerful content
Shall make me both healthful and wise.
In the pleasures the great man's possessions display,
Unenvied I'll challenge my part;
For every fair object my eyes can survey,
Contributes to gladden my heart.

The many their labours employ!
Since all that is truly delightful in life,

without making any other observation, as the common
road runs right over the bridge, and it is said that some
people have actually passed over without being aware
of it. But though this is certainly a possible occurrence

On the right and left he will perceive that the slope of
the hill is interrupted by a deep and sudden descent;
and on going nearer to the right side of the road, he finds
himself on the edge of a tremendous precipice. At the
bottom a small stream is seen making its way amidst
broken rocks. Going to the opposite side of the road
and looking down there, he will observe the little
river continuing its course in a deep channel down a
narrow valley. The traveller is now on the Natural
Bridge; he is standing on a stupendous natural arch
of limestone ; and though he may form some conjecture
of his situation by looking down from the edge of
the precipice, he can have no adequate conception
without viewing it from below. The arch is best
seen from the bed of the rivulet, and from a point
just under it. On looking up you behold a noble arch

occasions no ordinary stratagem is necessary to be
resorted to, by the huntsman, to prevent others from
availing themselves of the advantage of his discoveries ;
for, if his steps be traced by those who may be engaged
in the same pursuit, which is a very common thing, all
his ingenuity must be exerted to beguile them from the
true scent. In this, however, he is not always success-
ful, being followed by those who are entirely aware of
all the arts he may use, and whose eyes are so quick
that the lightest turn of a leaf, or the faintest impression
of the foot, is unerringly perceived. The treasure being,
however, reached by one party or another, the next
operation is the felling of a sufficient number of trees to
employ the gang during the season. The mahogany
tree is commonly cut about ten or twelve feet from the
ground, a stage being erected for the axe-man em-
ployed in levelling it. The trunk of the tree, from the
dimensions of the wood it furnishes, is deemed the most
valuable; but, for ornamental purposes, the limbs, or
branches, are generally preferred.
A sufficient number of trees being felled to occupy
the gang during the season, they commence cutting the
roads upon which they are to be transported. This
may fairly be estimated at two-thirds of the labour and
expense of mahogany cutting. Each mahogany work
forms in itself a small village on the bank of a river,-
the choice of situation being always regulated by the
proximity of such river to the mahogany intended as
the object of future operations.
After completing the establishment of a sufficient
number of huts for the accommodation of the workmen,
a main road is opened from the settlement, in a direc-
tion as near as possible to the centre of the body of

We might do pretty well just while we were at work

There is a time which we spend with our families;

respected ;—this sanctuary, abandoned, isolated through
barbarism, and surrendered to the desert from which it
was won; this city, shrouded in the veil of mystery by
which even colossi are magnified; this remote city, which
imagination has only caught a glimpse of through the
darkness of time—was still so gigantic an apparition,
that, at the sight of its scattered ruins, the army halted
of its own accord, and the soldiers, with one spontaneous
movement, clapped their hands."
Thebes lay on each side of the Nile, and extendnd
also on both sides as far as the mountains. The tombs
which are on the western side reach even into the limits
of the desert. Four principal villages stand on the site
of this ancient city,—Luxor and Carnak on the eastern,
Gournou and Medinet-Abou on the western side.
The temple of Luxor is very near the river, and there is
here a good ancient jettée, well built of bricks. The en-
trance to this temple is through a magnificent gateway,
facing the north, 200 feet in front, and 57 feet high
above the present level of the soil. Before the gateway
stand the two most perfect obelisks that exist, formed,
as usual, of the red granite of Syene, and each about 80
feet high, and from 8 to 10 feet wide at the base. Be.
tween these obelisks and the gateway are two colossal
statues, also of red granite; from the difference of the
dresses it is judged that one was a male, the other a fe-
male, figure they are nearly of equal sizes. Though
buried in the ground to the chest, they still measure 21
and 22 feet from thence to the top of the mitre.
It is this gateway that is filled with those remarkable
sculptures, which represent the triumph of some ancient
monarch of Egypt over an Asiatic enemy, and which
we find repeated, both on other monuments of Thebes,
and partly also on some of the monuments of Nubia,
as, for example, at Ipsambul. This event appears
to have formed an epoch in Egyptian history, and to
have furnished materials both for the historian and the
sculptor, like the war of Troy to the Grecian poet. The

THE TEMPLE CHURCH.
some repairs on the building after a fire, in 1695; but
an accurate copy of the inscription had been taken a
short time before, and it has lately been replaced in its
old situation. The order of the Templars was suppressed
in 1312; and the Temple was then given by the King,
Edward II., to the Knights Ilospitallers of St. John
of Jerusalem, whose chief seat in London was the magni-
ficent establishment of St. John's Clerkenwell, a fragment
of which, the well-known gate, is still standing. The
new proprietors of the Temple, however, do not appear
to have ever taken up their residence here ; but about
the middle of the fourteenth century they granted a lease
of the house to the society of students of the common
law, who then occupied Thavies Inn, in Holborn. The
lawyers, now divided into two societies, have kept pos-
session of the Temple ever since, having, in 1609, obtained
a perpetual lease of it, at a rent of 201. from the Crown,
into whose hands it had come, on the dissolution of the
order of the Knights Hospitallers, and all other mo
institutions, in the reign of Henry VIII.
The Temple Church very nearly fell a sacrifice to the
great fire in 1666. It was the stone-work of this build-
ing, indeed, by which the flames were first effectually
resisted. It suffered much injury, however, in 1695,
from another fire, which entirely destroyed a consider-
able part of the Temple. On that occasion, and also in
1811, it underwent extensive repairs ; but it has within
the last few years been still more completely renovated
under the direction of Mr. Smirke, who has shown great
taste in his restoration of the decayed parts of the build-
ing: The Temple Church has generally been considered
as having been built on the model of the Basilica, or
Metropolitan temple, of Jerusalem, from which the
knights, by whom it was founded, derived their name.
The following is the architectural description of the edi-
fice, as given by Mr. Brayley in his Londiniana : “Ali
the exterior walls, which are five feet in thickness, are

[Interior of the Temple Church.]
The interesting church, of the interior of which the
above is a representation, is, in part at least, perhaps
the very oldest building now remaining in the metro-
polis. The character of the architecture of the circular
edifice which forms its western extremity, in which the
windows are terminated by the circular or Norman, and
not by the pointed or Gothic arch, proves it to be a
work of not a later date than the twelfth century. And
this inference is confirmed by the historical fact of its
having been dedicated to the Virgin Mary, by Hera-
clius, the patriarch of Jerusalem, when he was in Eng.
land, in the year 1185. At this time it was probably
newly built. The ground now occupied by what are
called the Inner and the Middle Temples, and also a
space lying to the west of the latter, formerly designated
the Outer Temple, and now covered by Essex-street
and its neighbourhood, was anciently the property and
chiet seat, in England, of the wealthy and renowned
community of military monks, the Knights Templars.
The first house, or preceptory, as it was called, which
the Templars had in this country, was situated on the
south side of Holborn, on the spot where the South-
ampton-buildings now stand. From thence they re-
moved, probably about the time of the dedication of
the church, to this dwelling in Fleet-street, which
accordingly went for a long time by the name of the
New Temple. The body, or eastern part of the church,
appears. to have been built about the year 1240; and
here the arches of the windows are pointed, in con-
formity with the style which had by this time been
generally introduced. Formerly the dedication of the
church by Heraclius was recorded in a Latin inscription,
cut in the characters of the time, on a stone over the
south-west entrance to the round end. This stone was
roken by the workmen, who were employed in executing

THE WEEK.
JUNE 28.—The birth-day of the celebrated Peter Paul
RUBENS, who, although far from being the greatest,
may be fitly described as the cleverest of painters.
Rubens, whose family was noble, was born at Antwerp
in 1577. His father died when he was only ten years
old, leaving him the youngest of seven children. The
profession chosen for him by his mother was that of the
law; and, having been sent to the grammar-school with
this view, he evinced the quickness of his parts by the
extraordinary progress which he made in classical learn-
ing, soon acquiring such familiarity with the Latin as to
be able to write and speak it as fluently as his native
tongue. The talents of Rubens, indeed, there can be no
doubt, were such as would have enabled him to make
a distinguished figure in any line of exertion to which
he had devoted himself
. But nature had appointed him
another destination than that contemplated by his mother.
While yet very young the genius of the future painter
declared itself in an importunately urged desire to be
allowed to dedicate himself to the art in which he after-
wards acquired so illustrious a name. He was accord-
ingly placed under the charge of Adam Van-ort, one of
the ablest masters who then resided in Antwerp, but
whose school he soon after left for that of Otto Vaenius.
Four years of study sufficed to render him superior to
both his teachers; and indeed to promise for him so
distinguished a reputation in his own country that, be-
ing yet only in his twenty third year, he proceeded to
Italy, furnished with the warmest recommendations from
the Archduke Albert, the governor of the Netherlands.
In Italy he spent seven years, visiting in the course or

enjoyment from existence as the cattle who graze on the
most luxuriant pastures, beneath a genial sky. They are
not often found at a great distance from woods ; but
when they feed upon open grounds they prefer the most
precipitous situations, climbing amidst rocks with all the
agility and precision of the mountain-goat or the chamois.
Grass, when they can get it, moss, twigs of willow, and
pine shoots, constitute their food. The parts of the polar
regions inhabited by the musk-ox are thus described in
the Appendix to Parry's Second Voyage :-
" This species of ox inhabits the North Georgian Islands

and quitted it on their return towards the end of September.

The book upon the subject of manufactures which
Mr. Babbage has now given to the world, consists chiefly
of a very large and multifarious collection of the mecha-
nical expedients employed in the different branches of
our national industry, arranged according to the general
principle, of which each is an exemplification. The
author has in this way furnished a work which is not
less interesting to the mere general reader than it is
likely to prove valuable to the student of mechanics.
Surrounded as we are in this o untry by the wonders of
mechanical invention, he among us must be singularly
destitute of enlightened curiosity who feels no desire to
understand the operation of those beautiful and most
effective contrivances which he everywhere sees or hears
in motion; or to trace through the various stages of their
fabrication those numberless articles of use and of orna-
ment of which every one of our shops, and it may
almost be said of our houses, is full. The history of
some of the most apparently trivial or insignificant of
these productions, of a pin or a needle for instance, is
often a rich succession of the most exquisite efforts of
ingenuity—of the most important results obtained by
the simplest means, and of a velocity and at the same
time perfection of operation which to the unaccustomed
observer would seem little short of miraculous. The

calculated to beget a very favourable opinion of the

Although it contains some sensible remarks upon Mrs
Trollope's volumes, which we lately noticed, and also
upon a variety of other minor points, the greater por-
tion of it is devoted to an examination of the financial
results of the American system of government, and a
comparison of the burthens which it imposes upon the
people with those which are borne by the inhabitants of
England ard of France. The settlement of this ques-
tion appears to be the principal aim of the writer ; and
he has brought together the tables and estimates of
various authorities by whom it has been investigated.
In looking at these statements, however, it must be
borne in mind, that the two countries are differently
situated in many other respects, as well as in regard to
their political institutions; and the difference between
the amount of taxes paid in the one and that paid in the
other, may arise, wholly or in part, from circumstances
with which the form of the government has really
nothing whatever to do.
It is our duty to mention this circumstance to point
out that any belief that the two countries can be brought
to the same point of taxation is somewhat irrational.

The bos caffer is no more a beast of prey than the

[From a Correspondent.]
powerful than the ox, and bold enough sometimes to
stand stoutly on self defence even against the lion, it is,
I apprehend, nevertheless his natural instinct to retire
from the face of man, if undisturbed, rather than to
provoke his hostility. The proofs that are adduced of
his vicious and wanton malignity arise chiefly from the
following cause. The males of a herd, especially at
certain seasons of the year, contend furiously for the
mastery; and after many conflicts the unsuccessful
competitors are driven off, at least for a season, by their
stronger rivals. The exiles, like some other species of
animals under similar circumstances *, are peculiarly
mischievous; and it is while skulking solitarily about
the thickets, in this state of sulky irritation, that they
most usually exhibit the dangerous disposition generally
ascribed to the species.
It is, nevertheless, very true that the Cape buffalo is,
at all times, a dangerous animal to hunt; as, when
wounded, or closely pressed, he will not unfrequently
turn and run down his pursuer, whose only chance of
escape in that case is the swiftness of his steed, if the
huntsman be a Colonist or European. The Hottentot,
who is light and agile, and dexterous in plunging like an
antelope through the intricacies of an entangled forest,
generally prefers following this game on foot. Like all
pursuits, when the spirit of enterprise is highly excited

has been commonly received is, that Sebert, King of
Essex, having been baptized about the year 605, imme-
diately afterwards, to give proof of the sincerity of his
conversion, built a church here and dedicated it to St.
Peter. It is certain that Sebert was in old times uni-
versally regarded as the original founder of the Abbey;
nio better evidence of which can be desired than the care
which is known to have been taken on more than one
occasion to preserve his remains and those of his queen
Ethelgotha on the repair or reconstruction of the build-
ing, and to re-deposit them in the most honourable
place within it. Some writers, however, have contended
that this church could not really have had any existence
till more than a century after the time of Sebert. Ac-
cording to other accounts, again, Sebert was not only
the founder of Westminster Abbey, but also of St. Paul's
Cathedral. So imperfect, obscure, and perplexing are
the notices that have come down to us of those times.
A fable of no ordinary audacity was invented by the
monks in regard to the first consecration of this Abbey.
It was pretended that the ceremony had been actually
performed by St. Peter in person. We need not repeat
the circumstantial details of the story; suffice it to men-
tion, that towards the middle of the thirteenth century
the brethren of the monastery actually sued the
minister of Rotherhithe for the tithe of the salmon
caught in his parish, on the plea, as Fleta informs
us, that St. Peter had given them this right at the
time when he consecrated their church. After the
death of Sebert, his subjects relapsed into paganism,

It is impossible for us, within our narrow limits, to at-
lenpt either an enumeration of the various curiosities and
objects of interest which this Abbey contains, or even
any description of the form and architectural character
of the building. What is properly the church is in the
lorn of a cross; but its eastern end is surrounded by
chapels, varying both in their shape and dimensions.
Or these there were formerly fourteen; there are still
twelve; and although that called Henry VII.'s stands
out from the rest in richness and beauty, several of
the others also display considerable luxury of decoration.

the famous stone which was brought from Scone in Scot-
land, by Edward I. in 1296, and upon which our kings
have since been crowned. But the principal attraction
of Westminster Abbey to the generality of its visitors,
arises from the numerous tombs which it contains, some
of which are monumental erections of great splendour.

success did not depend upon superior skill and superior
morality in making an excellent article at a moderate price,
but upon superior capacity for fraud, meanness, syco-
phancy, and every possible baseness. Our lives were any-
thing but enviable. Conscience, although greatly blunted
by practices that were universal and viewed as inevitable,
still whispered that they were wrong; our sentiments of
self-respect very frequently revolted at the insults to which
we were exposed, and there was a constant feeling of inse-
curity from the great extent to which we were dependent
upon wretches whom we internally despised. When the
government took a higher tone and more principle, and
greater strictness in the collection of the duties were en-

time amongst the higher class of society. After a time,
however, the practice of smoking tobacco appears to
have met with strenuous opposition in high places, both
in this country and other parts of Europe. Its principal
opponents were the priests, the physicians, and the sove-
reign princes ; by the former its use was declared sinful;
and, in 1684, Pope Urban VIII. published a bull, ex-
communicating all persons found guilty of taking snuff
when in church. This bull was renewed in 1690, by
Pope Innocent ; and, about twenty-nine years after-
wards, the Sultan Amurath IV. made smoking a capital
offence. For a long time smoking was forbidden in
Russia, under pain of having the nose cut off; and in
some parts of Switzerland, it was likewise made a sub-
ject of public prosecution-the police regulations of the
canton of Berne, in 1661, placing the prohibition of
smoking in the list of the Ten Commandments, imme-

July 20,-The birth-day of FRANCIS PETRARCH, one
of the three renowned fathers of the literature of modern
Italy. He was born in 1304, at Arezzo, in the Floren-
tine territory, the same district which had the glory of
giving birth to his immediate predecessor Dante, and
also to the other member of the illustrious trio, his
contemporary and friend Boccaccio. Petrarch's father
had been a notary in the city of Florence, but had,
like Dante, been banished some time before the birth
of his son in consequence of one of the political
convulsions then so frequent. Being intended by his
father for his own profession, he was sent to study
first at Montpellier and afterwards at Bologna; but
he soon became deeply smitten with the charms of
the newly-revived literature of antiquity, Virgil and
Cicero stealing most of the hours which were pro-
fessedly devoted to more rugged pages. His father
is related to have been so much displeased on dis-
covering how his son employed his time, that he took
his favourite authors from him and threw them into the
fire. This severity, however, failed to make a lawyer of
Petrarch. His father died when he was about two and
twenty, and he immediately abandoned the law alto-
gether. He then chose the church for his profession;

"{Cotton-Gossypium herbaceum.]
There are many species of the cotton plant, and their
number is being constantly increased by the researches
of botanists, while their varieties appear scarcely to have
any limit. To the cotton planter it is a matter of much
interest to become acquainted with all these distinctive
varieties, as some are incomparably more valuable than
others, in the quantity and quality of their produce.
The Gossypium herbaceum, or common herbaceous
cotton plant, is the species most generally cultivated.
This species divides itself into annual and perennial
plants. The first is herbaceous, rising scarcely to the
height of eighteen or twenty inches. It bears a large
yellow flower with a purple centre, which produces a
pod about the size of a walnut. This, when ripe, bursts;
and exhibits to view the fleecy cotton, in which the
seeds are securely imbedded. It is sown and reaped

which forms a shrub of from four to six feet high.
The quantity of cotton which each plant yields is as
various as its quality. Accordingly there are scarcely
two concurrent opinions to be collected on this subject.
The average produce per English acre is reckoned by
different writers at various quantities, varying from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred and seventy pounds
of picked cotton.
The cotton plant will grow in most situations and
soils, and is cultivated with very little trouble or exo
pense. According to Humboldt, the larger species
which attain to the magnitude of trees require a mean
annual temperature of 68º Fabrenheit ; the shrubby kind
may be cultivated with success under a mean temperature
of 60° to 64°. The plant is propagated by seed.
When the season has been favourable, the cotton is
in general fit for pulling about seven or eight months
after it has been sown. This period is, however, well
indicated by the spontaneous bursting of the capsule or
seed-pod. The plantations at this time present a very
pleasing appearance. The glossy dark green leaves
finely contrast with the white globular forms profusely
scattered over the tree. In the East the produce is
gathered by taking off the whole of the pod. In other
parts, and this is the more general practice, the seeds
and cotton are taken away, leaving the empty brusks.

THE WEEK.
July 22.-On this day, in the year 1707, was born at
Maestricht in the Netherlands, the celebrated naturalist
Pierre LyonNET. He was originally educated for the
church, and distinguished himself at school and college
by the extracrdinary facility with which he acquired
many foreign languages, obtaining, it is said, such a
mastery over the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Italian,
Spanish, German, and English, as to know them almost
as well as his own. Lyonnet, when he grew up, aban-
doned the church for the law, and eventually became
Latin and French interpreter to the United Provinces.
It was while he occupied this situation, which left him a
good deal of leisure, that he first turned his attention to
the study of nature. The animal, and especially the
insect creation formed his favourite department of

Cotton-Gossypium herbaceum.]
THERE are many species of the cotton plant, and their
number is being constantly increased by the researches
of botanists, while their varieties appear scarcely to have
any limit. To the cotton planter it is a matter of much
interest to become acquainted with all these distinctive
varieties, as some are incomparably more valuable than
others, in the quantity and quality of their produce.
The Gossypium herbaceum, or common herbaceous
cotton plant, is the species most generally cultivated.
This species divides itself into annual and perennial
plants. The first is herbaceous, rising scarcely to the
height of eighteen or twenty inches. It bears a large
yellow flower with a purple centre, which produces a
pod about the size of a walnut. This, when ripe, bursts;

which forms a shrub of from four to six feet high.
The quantity of cotton which each plant yields is as
various as its quality. Accordingly there are scarcely
two concurrent opinions to be collected on this subject.
The average produce per English acre is reckoned by
different writers at various quantities, varying from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred and seventy pounds
of picked cotton.
The cotton plant will grow in most situations and
soils, and is cultivated with very little trouble or ex-
pense. According to Humboldt, the larger species
which attain to the magnitude of trees require a mean
annual temperature of 68° Fahrenheit ; the shrubby kind
may be cultivated with success under a mean temperature
of 60° to 64. The plant is propagated by seed.
When the season has been favourable, the cotton is
in general fit for pulling about seven or eight months
after it has been sown. This period is, however, well
indicated by the spontaneous bursting of the capsule or
seed-pod. The plantations at this time present a very
pleasing appearance. The glossy dark green leaves

THE WEEK.
July 22.-On this day, in the year 1707, was born at
Maestricht in the Netherlands, the celebrated naturalist
Pierre LYONNET. He was originally educated for the
church, and distinguished himself at school and college
by the extracrdinary facility with which he acquired
many foreign languages, obtaining, it is said, such a
mas'ery over the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Italian,
Spanish, German, and English, as to know them almost
as well as his own. Lyonnet, when he grew up, aban-
doned the church for the law, and eventually became
Latin and French interpreter to the United Provinces.
It was while he occupied this situation, which left him a
good deal of leisure, that he first turned his attention to
the study of nature. The animal, and especially the
insect creation formed his favourite department of
inquirys and the valuable museum of shells and other
specimens which he collected, together with the zeal

land, thrown up as for wheat, and kept dry, affords the
best teazles. Weeding, draining, and other requisites,
demand a constant labour through great part of the
year; and hence a certain expense is incurred: but re-
muneration, loss, or great profit, depend on circum-
stances. Perhaps there is no article grown more pre-
carious or mutable in its returns.
The teazle throws up its heads in July and August ;
and these are cut from the plant by hand, with a knife
peculiarly formed, and then fastened to poles for dry-
ing : the terminating heads are ready first, and called
“ kings;" they are larger and coarser than the others,
and fitted only for the strongest kinds of cloth, and are
about half the value of the best. The collateral heads
then succeed, and receive the name of " middlings,"
and are the prime teazles. Should the season prove
moist, great injury ensues; but exposure to wet for any
length of time ruins the head, which, by its peculiar
construction, retains the moisture, and it decays. They
cannot be stacked like corn, as pressure destroys the
spines, and a free circulation of air is required to dry
them thoroughly. Barns, sheds, and even the very bed-
rooms of the cottages are crowded with them in dripping
seasons. This is attended with infinite trouble; and as
few farmers, who have so many other concerns on their
hands, like to encounter it, they become the speculation
of the most opulent class of cottagers. When dry, they
are picked and sorted into bundles for sale, ten thousand

on hand, and the season favourable, there is a sufficiency
for the demand, and the price low: if adverse weather
ensue, the price becomes greatly advanced, and, in the

it fell upon him from the roof the lantern. Nobody
could believe that this notion was anything more than
an imagination of the old man ; but on the twelfth day
after the fire, having been suddenly seized with cold
sweats and spasms, he expired; and when his body
was opened there was actually found in his stomach, to
the coat of which it had partly adhered, a flat oval
piece of lead of the weight of seven ounces five drachms.
An account of this extraordinary case is to be found in
the 49th volume of the Philosophical Transactions.
As there was still more than half a century of their
lease unexpired, the proprietors, who by this time had
become numerous, felt that it was not their interest to
lose a moment in setting about the re-building of the

lighthouse. One of them, a Mr. Weston, in whom the
others placed much confidence, made application to
Lord Macclesfield, the President of the Royal Society,
to recommend to them the person whom he considered
most fit to be engaged. His Lordship immediately
named and most strongly recommended Mr. Smeaton,
who had recently left the business of mathematical in-
strument maker, which he had practised for some years
in London, and taken up that of a civil engineer, for
which his genius admirably fitted him.

1756. On the 22d of March the architect set out
for Plymouth, but, on account of the badness of the
roads (how strangely such a statement reads now), did
not reach the end of his journey till the 27th. He re-
mained at Plymouth till the 21st of May, in the course
of which time he repeatedly visited the rock, and having,
with the consent of his employers, determined that the
• new lighthouse should be of stone, hired work-yards
and workmen, contracted for the various materials he
wanted, and made all the other necessary arrangements
for beginning and carrying on the work. Everything
being in readiness, and the season sufficiently advanced,
on the 5th of August the men were landed on the rock,
and immediately began cutting it for the foundation of
the building. This part of the work was all that was
accomplished that season, in the course of which, how-
ever, both the exertions and the perils of the architect
and his associates were very great. On one occasion
the sloop in which Mr. Smeaton was, with eighteen sea-
men and labourers, was all but lost in returning from
the work.
During this time the belief and expressed opinion of
all sorts of per was that a stone lighthouse would
certainly not s e winds and seas to which it would
be exposed on the Eddystone. However, on the 12th
of June, 1757, the first stone was laid.

to the spot where they scarcely expected ever again to
discern it, and a feeling almost of wonder nixed itself
with the joy, and thankfulness, and pride of the archi-
tect's friends, as they with difficulty descried its form
through the still dark and troubled air. It was unin-
jured, even to a pane of glass in the lantern. In a
letter from Plymouth upon this occasion the writer says,
" It is now my most steady belief, as well as everybody's
here, that its inhabitants are rather more secure in a

we are in our houses from the former only."
From this period the work proceeded with great
rapidity. On the 26th of August, 1759, all the stone-
work was completed. On the 9th of October following
the building was finished in every part; and on the
16th of the same month the saving light was again
streaming from its summit over the waves. Thus the
whole undertaking was accomplished within a space
of little more than three years, " without the loss of
life or limb," says Mr. Smeaton, “ to any one concerned
in it, or accident by which the work could be said to
be materially retarded." During all this time there had
been only 421 days, comprising 2674 hours, which it
had been possible for the men to spend upon the rock ;
and the whole time which they had been at work there
was only 111 days 10 hours, or scarcely sixteen weeks.
Nothing can show more strikingly than this statement
the extraordinary difficulties under which the work had
to be carried on.
Smeaton's lighthouse has stood ever since, and pro-
mises yet to stand for many centuries. It is, as has
been mentioned, of stone, and is a round building, gra-
dually decreasing in circumference from the base up to a
certain height, like the trunk of an oak, from which the
architect states that he took the idea of it. Among many
other tempests which it has endured unshaken, was one
of extraordinary fury, which occurred in the beginning
of the year 1762. One individual, Smeaton tells us, who
was fond of predicting its fate, declared, on that occasion,
that if it still stood it would stand till the day of judg-

chief fury, many anxious observers pointed their glasses

The plan we have given shows their position; and the
following account, extracted from Lewis's Topographical
Dictionary of England, a valuable work recently com-
pleted in four quarto volumes, affords such information
as may render the plan perfectly intelligible:---
For the security of the shipping in the port, and for the
greater facility of loading and unloading merchandize, an
immense range of docks and warehouses, extending nearly
two miles along the eastern bank of the river (the Mersey),
has been constructed on a scale of unparelleled magnifi-
cence, and forming one of those characteristics of commer-
cial greatness in which this town is unrivalled. The docks
are of three kinds, the wet docks, the dry docks, and the
graving docks : the wet docks are chiefly for ships of great
burden employed in the foreign trade, and which float in
them at all states of the tide, the water being retained by
gates: the dry docks, so called because they are left dry
when the tide is out, are chiefly appropriated to coasting
vessels; and the graving docks, which admit or exclude the
water at pleasure, are adapted to the repair of ships, during
which they are kept dry, and when completed are floated
Ad out by admitting the tide. The Old Dock, which was the first
of the kind constructed in England, and for making which,
an act of parliament was obtained in 1708, is not now in use,
its site having been appropriated to the erection of a new
custom-house, and other offices connected with the trade of
the port. The Dry Dock, which is about to be converted into
a wet dock, was constructed under the authority of an act
passed in the 11th of George II., and is chiefly occupied by
sloops from the north coast, which import corn, provisions,
and slate, and convey back the produce of the West Indies,
the Mediterranean, Portugal, and Baltic: it has a quay five
hundred yards in length, and has communication with three
graving docks; it has been considerably enlarged, and many
of the buildings surrounding it have been taken down with
the view of obtaining more quay room. The Salthouse
Dock, so named from some salt-works formerly contiguous
to it, was constructed about the same time as the Dry Dock;
the upper part of it is chiefly for ships that are laid up, and
the lower part for vessels in the Levant, Irish, and coasting
trades; the quay is seven hundred and fifty-nine yards in
extent, and is provided with convenient warehouses, with
arcades for foot-passengers on the east side, and extensive
A sheds on the west side: between this dock and the river are
some ship-builders' yards, which the corporation intend to
convert into docks for the craft employed in the inland trade.
George's Dock was constructed in the 2d of George III., at
an expense of 21,0001.; it was originally two hundred and
forty-six yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth,
with a quay of seven hundred yards in extent; but it has
been enlarged, and the quay is now one thousand and one
yards in length: on the east side is a range of extensive
warehouses, in front of which is an arcade for foot-passen-
gers; and on the west side are sheds for protecting the
merchandize from the weather : at the north and south ends
of the dock are handsome cast-iron bridges; and a parade
is continued westward for a considerable distance into the
river: this dock has a communication with the two pre-
ceding docks, and also with the Prince's Dock, by basins,
which preclude the necessity of returning into the river.
The King's Dock, constructed in the 25th of George III., is
two hundred and seventy yards in length, and ninety-six in
breadth, and is appropriated to vessels from Virginia and
other parts, laden with tobacco, which article is exclusively
landed here: the new tobacco warehouses extend the whole
length of the quay, on the west side, and are five hundred
and seventy-five feet in length, and two hundred and thirty-
nine in depth; the old warehouses on the opposite side,
which were appropriated to that purpose, have been con-
verted into sheds for the security of merchandize : ships
from the Baltic, freighted with timber and naval stores

same time, is four hundred and seventy yards long, and two

spacious quay, and is chiefly occupied by vessels freighted

trades; at the south end it communicates with a basin of

time I had been astonished by the little interest they took,

missions ; but, when they began to have some idea of geo-

science, and of the very existence of many foreign nations
in distant quarters of the globe, was the cause of such indif-
ference. But as soon as they began to learn who the peo-
ple are who require to have the Gospel preached to them,
and in what part of the globe they dwell, they felt the same
concern for the circulation of the Gospel that other Chris-
tians entertained. These new acquirements, in fact, en-

to triple their very existence.

rium, although in the usual place of grinders, have the
provision for growing at the fangs, whilst they waste on

cutting vegetables, and, probably, the roots dug out of
the earth. From the processes of the scapula, or shoul-
der-blade, we see that this animal had a clavicle, or
collar-bone, and that the radius and ulna had free rota-

that the muscles which roll the wrist-joint were powerful:

THE OLIVE.
olives and the manufacture of the oil afford a consider-
able employment to many of the inhabitants of France
and Italy. The importation of olive oil into Great
Britain amounted, in 1827, to about four thousand five
hundred tons, paying a duty of eight guineas per tun.
In ancient times, especially, the olive, was a tree held
in the greatest veneration ; for then the oil was employed
in pouring out libations to the gods, while the branches
formed the wreaths of the victors at the Olympic Games,
The Greeks had a pretty and instructive fable in their
mythology, on the origin of the olive. They said that
Neptune having a dispute with Minerva, as to the
name of the city of Athens, it was decided by the gods
that the deity who gave the best present to mankind
should have the privilege in dispute. Neptune struck
the shore, out of which sprung a horse : but Minerva
produced an olive-tree. The goddess had the triumph;
for it was adjudged that Peace, of which the olive is the
symbol, was intinitely better than War, to which the
horse was considered as belonging, and typifying. Even
in the sacred history, the olive is invested with more
honour than any other tree. The patriarch Noah had
sent out a dove from the ark, but she returned without
any token of hope. Then" He stayed yet other seven
days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
and the dove came to him in the evening; and, lo, in
her mouth was an olive-branch plucked off: so Noah
knew that the waters were abated from the earth.”

Where olives abound they give much beauty to the
landscape. The beautiful plain of Athens, as seen
toward the north-west from Mount Hymettus, appears
entirely covered with olive-trees. Tuscany, the south of
France, and the plains of Spain, are the places of
Europe in which the olive was first cultivated. The
Tuscans were the first who exported olive-oil largely,

The proper time for gathering olives for the press is
the eve of maturity. If delayed too long, the next crop
is prevented, and the tree is productive only in the
alternate years. At Aix, where the olive harvest takes
place early in November, it is annual : in Languedoc,

seas of British ships. But in the February following,
the English hero, having employed the interval with ad-
mirable diligence in repairing his ships, again put to sea
with a fleet of sixty sail, and soon after encountered his
old adversary at the head of seventy men-of-war, and
having three hundred merchantmen under convoy. The
battle this time was far more obstinate than any that had
yet been fought between them : for three days the two
armaments, running up the Channel together, scarcely
intermitted their furious fire; when at last, on the fourth
morning, the Dutch, having lost eleven of their ships of
war and thirty merchantmen, while only one of the Eng-
lish vessels was destroyed, took flight for the coast of Hol-
land. Several other engagements took place between the
two admirals in the course of the same year; and the re-
sult, upon the whole, was decidedly in favour of the
English. Having thus asserted the dominion of his
countrymen over their surrounding seas, Blake returned
to England, and was received both by the Protector and
the people with all respect and honour. Some time
before this Cromwell had dismissed the Long Parliament,
and openly assumed arbitrary power; but Blake being

(Grotesque representation of a Portrait Painter's Studio.
During the progress of the excavations at Pompeii, a
painting was found in the Casa Carolina, which scarcely
held together to be copied, and fell in pieces upon the
first rain. It is of grotesque character, and represents
a pigmy painter whose only covering is a tunic. He is
at work upon the portrait of another pigmy, clothed in a
manner to indicate a person of distinction. The artist
is seated opposite to his sitter, at an awful distance from
the picture, which is placed upon an easel, similar in
construction to ours. By the side of the artist stands
his palette, which is a little table with four feet, and by
it is a pot to wash his pencils in.
He therefore was
working with gum, or some sort of water-colours : but
he did not confine himself to this branch of the art, for
to the right we see his colour-grinder, who prepares in a
vessel placed on some hot coals, colours mixed with wax
and oil. Two amateurs enter the studio, and appear to
be conversing with respect to the picture. On the noise
occasioned by their entrance, a scholar seated in the dis-
tance turns round to look at them. It is difficult to ex-
plain the presence of the bird in the painting-room. The
picture is not complete : a second bird, and on the op-
posite side a child playing with a dog, had perished before
Mazois (an artist who has preserved some of the most va-
luable remains at Pompeii) copied it. This picture is very
curious, as it shows how few things, in the mechanical prac-
tice of painting, have been changed during 2000 years.
There is another picture preserved at Pompeii, repre-
senting a female employed in making a copy of the
bearded Bacchus. She is dressed in a light green
tunic, without sleeves, over which she wears a dark red
'mantle.' Beside her is a small box, such as we are told
by Varro painters used, divided into compartments, into
which she dips her brush. She mixes her tints on the
palette, which she holds in her left hand.

CONSTANTINOPLE-No. 2.
The mosque which has been most talked of, because
it was anciently a Christian temple, and was supposed to
have suggested to the Turks the grand dome, or cupola,
which predominates in all the rest of their religious
edifices, is that of Santa Sophia. Several of the impe-
rial mosques, however, far excel Santa Sophia in situ-
ation, boldness, and beauty. If the Turks borrowed the
dome from it, they have immensely improved on the
voriginal, which is comparatively low and heavy, whilst
their cupolas are lofty, light, and graceful. This is parti-
cularly the case with the mosque of Sultan Achmet
,
which may be deemed, altogether, the grandest edifice in
Constantinople. It stands on one side of the ancient
square of the Hippodrome, from which it is separated
by a beautiful low wall or screen, with three gates and
seventy-two grated windows. Within this wall is a
large court paved with marble, and ornamented in the
midst by a beautiful fountain, of the same mate-
rial, and of hexagonal form. The basis of the mosque
occupies a stately square. Its elevation is exceedingly
bold and striking : its proud dome rests on columns of
massive proportion, and its minarets, which shoot high
above the dome, have three circular galleries each. In

Many a beautiful work of the ancient Greek chisel has
thus been imbedded in a wall, or cut down and defaced
to make a Turkish tombstone; and many an edifice con-
structed in accordance with the pure styles of architecture
has been levelled and used as a quarry. But still, it must
be confessed that some of the Turkish buildings, and more
particularly some of the imperial mosques which have
risen in their places, are distinguished by grandeur and
beauty. Of these imperial mosques there are fourteen,
each lofty and magnificent in its general dimensions,
and built from base to dome with excellent and enduring
materials-chiefly of white marble slightly 'tinged with
grey. Besides these, there are sixty ordinary mosques
varying in size and beauty, but all considerable edifices ;
and then, two hundred and more inferior mosques and

to it, was in ancient times the site of a monastery of Fran-
ciscans, or Grey Friars, as they were commonly styled.
This order (often denominated also Friars Minors, or
Minorites) was founded by the famous Francis of Assisi,
in the beginning of the thirteenth century, and for-
mally confirmed by a bull of Pope Honorius III. in
1224. That very year a party of the new religionists,
consisting of four priests and five laymen, landed at
Dover; and five of the nine remaining at Canterbury,
the other four were sent forward to London, to form
the commencement of an establishment there. On
reaching the capital they took up their abode, in the
first instance, with their brother mendicants, the Domi-
nicans, who had found their way into the country only
a year or two before, and were already settled in a house
at Holborn. The members of the two associations
would hardly have shown so edifying an example of
mutual confidence and good-will some time afterwards,
when their grey and black cloaks pointed them out as rival
competitors for the favour of the people. The first re-
sidence of their own which the Franciscans obtained,
was a house in Cornhill, which they got from John
Travers, the sheriff. They had not, however, remained
long here, when a pious and liberal citizen, John Ewen,

Every Londoner is familiar with the peculiar dress of
the boys of this school, or the Blue-coat boys, as they
are commonly called. It is the "nearest approach,"
says Mr. Brayley, “to the monkish costume which is
now worn. What is called the coat was the ancient
tunic ; this is of a dark blue cloth, fitted close to the
body, but with loose skirts. The under-coat, or yellow,
as it is technically termed, was the sleeveless or under
tunic of the monastery. The girdle round the waist
was likewise a monastic appendage ; but the breeches
are a subsequent addition. Yellow worsted stockings,
a very small, round, flat cap, of black worsted, and a ·
neckband, complete the dress."
Of the buildings most have been renewed since the
foundation of the hospital, and scarcely any part of the
old monastery now remains. The spacious old church
was destroyed in the great fire, and the present, which
occupies only the site of the ancient choir, is the work of
Sir Christopher Wren. The recent splendid additions
to the edifice of Christ Church will be noticed in the
Supplement.

It would far exceed our limits to give any account
either of the numerous benefactions by which the re-
venues of Christ Church have been augmented since the
time of its royal founder, or of the successive modifica-
tions which have been introduced into the plan of the
establishment. The annual income of this hospital is
supposed to be now above £40,000. Its management
is vested in the body of governors, composed of the lord-
mayor and the court of aldermen in right of their offices,
of twelve common councilmen chosen by lot, and of all
benefactors to the amount of £400 and upwards. Be-
sides the house in London, the society possess
another large edifice at Hertford, to which many of the
children are sent to receive the earlier part of their
education. The whole number of the young people
maintained on the foundation usually exceeds a thou-
sand. They are for the most part admitted on
presentations from the governors, to the number of
about 150 annually. After instruction in the usuai
elementary branches of education, the greater num-
ber leave the seminary at the age of fifteen, those
only remaining longer who intend to proceed to the
university, or to go to sea after completing a course of
mathematics. There are seven exhibitions at Cam-

August 29.--The anniversary of the birth of John
Locke, the eminent author of the Essay on the Human
Understanding. This event took place in 1632, exactly
two hundred years ago, at Wrington in Somersetshire.
Locke's father had been bred a lawyer, and when the
civil war broke out he evinced the character of his poli
tical principles by heading a company in the service of
the Parliament. Locke himself received his education
first at Westminster, and afterwards at Christ Church
College, Oxford, where he took the degree of Master of
· Arts in 1658, and then proceeded to prepare himself for the
medical profession. With the exception of about twelve
months which he spent on the Continent, in the capacity
of Secretary to the British Envoy at the Court of the
Elector of Brandenburg, he continued his medical stu-
dies without interruption till the year 1666, when he
became known to the celebrated Earl of Shaftesbury,
then Lord Ashley, of whom we gave a short account in
a recent number of the Magazine. From his acquaint-
ance with this nobleman the future life of Mr. Locke
took much of its complexion; and it is among the most
honourable facis which belong to the mixed fame of

and waited on the doctor with a long catalogue of ailments,
which he said afflicted his wife. The physician heard
with amazement diseases and pains of the most orpo-

patient. At length, being become completely master of his

scrape made an uncouth offer of it. Put up thy money,

sibility, that he would sooner die “ than prostitute his

would be singular, indeed, if it were not so; and a mi-
nister of the Crown would be unfit for the government
of our industrious community, if he did not feel that
the great inventions which have grown out of our com-

created that superiority, were not eminently calculated to
claim the noblest rewards that the people could bestow.

“ That the late James Watt, by his profound science,
and by the original genius exhibited in his admirable
inventions, has, more than any other of his contem-
poraries, demonstrated the practical utility of knowledge,
increased the power of man over the material world, and
extended the comforts and enjoyments of human life.”
This resolution was seconded by Mr. Boulton, the son
of Mr. Watt's distinguished partner.
The second resolution, that the services of James
Watt to the civilized world demanded a national tribute
of gratitude from his own country, was proposed by Mr.
Huskisson, and seconded by Sir James Macintosh. We
cannot forbear to quote a passage from the speech of
this philosophical orator, whose words are now heard no
more with reverence and delight: “ In less than half a

duced into St. George's Hospital by Mr. Keate, and else-
where.—The author has now seen enough of the effects of
this bed to make him feel it a duty at once to publish a
notice of it. With it, evidently, the fatal termination called
sloughing, now so common, of fevers, and other diseases,
need never occur again. And not only will it prevent that
termination, but by alleviating the distress through the ear-
lier stages, it may prevent many cases from even reaching
the degree of danger. Then it is peculiarly applicable to
cases of fractured bones, and other surgical injuries ; to
palsies, diseases of the hip joirt, and spine; and universally
where persons are obliged to pass much time in bed. And
in all classes of 'curvature of the spine, either actually exist-
ing or threatened, it affords a means of laying a patient in
any desired position, and with any degree of pressure inces-

used without the mattress, it becomes a warm or a cold bath,
not allowing the body however to be touched by the water;
and in India, it might be made a cool bed for persons sick
or sound, during the heats which there prevent sleep and
endanger health. There are numerous other professional
adaptations and modifications of it, which will readily occur
to practitioners sufficiently versed in the department of na-
tural philosophy (hydrostatics) to which it belongs. Before
reflection a person might suppose a resemblance between it
and an air-bed or pillow, calling this a water-bed or pillow;
but the principles of the two are perfectly distinct or oppo-
site. An air-pillow supports by the tension of the surface
which encloses the air, and is therefore like a hammock or

speaking, the manufacture of earthenware had, in this
country, remained unimproved; and in Europe, generally,
it had been almost as stationary. From the east, the

utensils, unless they added to these some of the rude
works of their native potters.

and nobles, as if ashamed of the neglect the art had ex-

For centuries previous to the time of which we are
speaking, the manufacture of earthenware had, in this
country, remained unimproved; and in Europe, generally,
it had been almost as stationary. From the east, the
wealthy and luxurious of the western hemisphere were
supplied with porcelain, valued on account of its rareness
rather than for its beauty; while the humbler ranks of
society sought no other than metal or wooden domestic
utensils, unless they added to these some of the rude
works of their native potters.
At length, in France, Germany, and Italy, princes
and nobles, as if ashamed of the neglect the art had ex-

[Shakspeare's House as it appeared in 1788.]
We proceed with Mr. Irving's agreeable narrative :-
“ From the birth-place of Shakspeare a few paces
brought me to his grave. He lies buried in the chancel
of the parish church, a large and venerable pile, moul-
dering with age, but richly ornamented. It stands on
the banks of the Avon, on an embowered point, and
separated by adjoining gardens from the suburbs of the
town. Its situation is quiet and retired : the river runs
murmuring at the foot of the church-yard, and the elms
which grow upon its banks droop their branches into
its clear bosom. An avenue of limes, the boughs of
which are curiously interlaced, so as to form in summer
an arched way of foliage, leads up from the gate of the
yard to the church-porch. The graves are overgrown
with grass ; the grey tomb-stones,
some of them nearly

marks the spot where the bard is buried. There are
four lines inscribed on it, said to have been written by
himself, and which have in them something extremely
awful. If they are indeed his own, they show that soli-

to fine sensibilities and thoughtful minds :-

more surprising is it to witness the snake-hunter ex-
tracting from the yet living and writhing reptile, held
fast by his naked foot planted on its neck, the little bag
containing the secreted venom, which the rage of the
animal injects into the wound made by its fangs at the
moment it strikes its victim—to see him take this, and
fearlessly drink its contents, as school-boys in England
would suck the blob of the honey-bee! The swallowing
of this venom, they conceive, renders them in time proof
against its deleterious effects, when it is brought into
immediate contact with the blood, whether by the bite of
a snake or the barb of an arrow.


(Distant View of Staffa.]
Starra, one of the Hebrides, or Western Isles of Scot-
land, lies a few miles to the west of Mull, within a sort
of bay formed by the two projecting extremities of that
island, and a short distance to the north-east of the more
celebrated islet of the same group, lona, or Icolmkill.
It forms part of the county of Argyle, and of the parish
of Kilninian, the principal portion of which is in Mull.
Staffa is a very small island, scarcely a mile in length
from north to south, and about half that extent at its
greatest breadth from east to west. Although one of the
most wonderful natural curiosities in the world, and
lying so near our own shores, this island appears to
have remained almost entirely unnoticed till a compara.
tively very recent period. Ti is said, in most of the late
accounts of it (which are in great part copied from one
another,) that its columns and caverns are shortly de-
scribed by Buchanan. In point of fact, however, that
historian merely mentions its name. It is not, we
believe, so much as named by Martin in his account of
the Western Isles, published in the beginning of last
century. Its existence was first made generally known
by Sir Joseph Banks who visited it in August, 1772,

in 1653 the daughter of the Duke de la Force, who died
however in 1666, without leaving children. This lady
was a person of great piety, and strongly attached to
the Protestant faith, of which her ancestors had been
among the first and most strenuous defenders. While
she lived, Turenne, a Protestant also by education and
by descent, both on his father's and mother's side, resisted
all the solicitations of the court to change his religion.
Not long after the death of his wife, however, after pro-

surpassed; and he was also brave as his sword, and so
wholly devoted in heart to his profession, that he thought
as little of its toils as of its dangers, and was at all times
ready to share both with the meanest in the camp.
Hence he was the idol of his men as well as their pride;
they not only admired, and followed with alacrity to the
field, the consummate captain and hero of a hundred
victories, but they loved the man. This military spirit
was the soul of Turenne's character and the source both
of its bright and of its darker points. Indeed, bred as he
was to the trade of arnis almost from his childhood, and
living in an age of such incessant warfare, it was hardly
possible that he should have been anything more than a
mere soldier. His name will be eternally disgraced by the

was sent by his mother, at the early age of thirteen, to
the Netherlands, to be trained to the art of war under
his uncle, Prince Maurice, who, since the assassination
of William in 1584, had presided over the affairs of that
country. The young recruit was placed at first in the
ranks, and served for a year as a common soldier, taking
his share in all the labours and hardships of his com-
rades, before he was raised to a post of command.
In 1630 he returned to France, and was immediately
invested with the command of a regiment. In 1634,
having made a brilliant display of his skill and courage
at the siege of the fortress of La Motte in Lorraine, he
was raised to the rank of Marechal de Camp. The next
year he was sent to Germany to take part in the war
against the Emperor. From this date till his death, he
was almost constantly engaged in active service; and

piest effort of the eminent architect, James Gibbs, a na-
tive of Scotland, by whom it was erected, and who is
also well known as the designer and builder of the
Senate House at Cambridge, the Radcliffe Library at
Oxford, and various other public edifices. The portico,
in particular, consisting of very lofty Corinthian columns,
to which there is an ascent by a long flight of steps, has
been greatly admired. The beauty and grandeur of
this noble elevation, however, have only been lately ren-
dered visible by the removal of the old buildings by
which it used to be so closely surrounded ; and its effect
will not be properly appreciated till the completion of
the magnificent improvements which are now in progress
in this quarter of the metropolis. The spire also of
St. Martin's is one of the most beautiful in London ;
and the interior of the church, and especially its richly
ornamented ceiling, may be fairly described as altogether
worthy of its external architecture. Its length is 140
feet; its breadth 60, and its height 45. The curve of
the ceiling is elliptical.
As this parish comprehends within its bounds the
palace of St. James's, St. Martin's is the proper parish
church of the royal family, and there are seats provided
accordingly for their Majesties and their household on
each side of the altar. George III. used occasionally
to attend public worship here. The Admiralty is also
in the parish of St. Martin's; and on that account it is
customary for naval victories to be first announced by
the bells of this church. On the day of the consecra-
tion, “the Lords of the Admiralty," says Malcolm,

SONG OF THE WILD BUSHMAN.
The Bushman retains the ancient arms of the Hottentot race;
namely, a javelin, or assagai, similar to that of the Caffers, and a
bow and arrows. The latter, which are his principal weapons, both
for war and the chace, are small in size and formed of slight mate.
rials; but, owing to the deadly poison with which the arrows are
embued, and the dexterity with which they are launched, they are
missiles truly formidable both to man and beast. One of these
arrows, formed merely of a piece of slender reed tipped with bone or
iron, is sufficient to destroy the most powerful animal. Neverthe-
less, although the Colonists very much dread the effects of the
Bushman's arrow, they know how to elude its range; and it is,
after all, but a very unequal match for the firelock, as the persecuted
natives, by sad experience, have found. The arrows are usually
kept in a quiver formed of the hollow stalk of a species of aloe, and
slang over the shoulder ; but a few, for immediate use, are often
stuck in a band round the head, in the manner represented in
the cut.

having approached its brink in a broad sheet, smooth as
a mirror, and reflecting the forests that clothe its margin,
tumbles impetuously into a deep hollow or basin, where
it is instantly ground into froth. A dense mist con-
tinually hovers over this boiling cauldron. From this
point downwards the channel of the river assumes a
chaotic appearance ; instead of the quiet and outspread
waters above the fall, we have now a contined and angry
torrent forcing its way with the noise of thunder between
steep and meeting rocks, and over incessant impediments.
The scenery on both sides, however, is exquisitely rich
and beautiful. A walk of about half a mile, which may
be said almost to overhang the river, leads to the second
and most famous of the falls, that called Corra Linn,
from the castle of Corra, now in ruins, which stands in
its neighbourhood. The tremendous rocks around,”
says the report on the parish of Lanark, published in
Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland,“ the
old castle upon the opposite bank, a corn-mill on the
rock below, the furious and impatient stream foaming over
the rock, the horrid chasm and abyss underneath your feet,
heightened by the hollow murmur of the water, and the
screams of wild birds, form a spectacle at once tremen-
dous and pleasing. A summer-house or pavilion, is
situated on a high rocky bank, that overlooks the linn,
built by Sir James Carmichael, of Bonnington, in 1708.
From its uppermost room it affords a very striking pros-
pect of the fall; for, all at once, on throwing your eyes
towards a mirror, on the opposite side of the room from
the fall, you see the whole tremendous cataract pouring
as it were upon your head. The Corra Limu, by mea-
surement, is eighty-four feet in height. The river does
not rush over it in one uniform sheet like Bonnington
Linn, but in three different, though almost imperceptible,
precipitate leaps. On the southern bank, and when the
sun shines, a rainbow is perpetually seen forming itself
upon the mist and fogs, arising from the violent dashing
of the waters,"—as Byron has beautifully sung of the
Cataract of Velino, in Italy :-
“ On the verge,
From side to side beneath the glittering morn,
An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,
Like Hope upon a death-bed, and, unworn
Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
By the distracted waters, bears serene
Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
Resembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,
Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.”
A short distance below Corra Linn is another fall
called Dundaff Linn, the appearance of which is also
very beautiful, though it is only about three feet and a
half high. About three miles farther down, and a con-
siderable way past the town of Lanark, is the last of
the falls, that called Stonebyres Linn. It is a precipice, or
rather a succession of three precipices, making together
a height of sixty-four feet. The same general features of
rugged rocks, here appearing in all their dreary bareness,
there concealed by trees and shrubs, of wild birds
winging their flight over the bounding cataract and
mingling their screams with its roar, and of cultivated
nature in its most luxuriant beauty contending all around
with the sublimity of the untamed torrent, which belong
to Corra Linn, mark that of Stonebyres also, though
with some diminution of the romantic effect.
liar phenomenon which is to be seen here, is that of the
incessant endeavours of the salmon, in the spawning
season, to mount the lofty barrier by which they now tind
their migration from the sea for the first time opposed.
Their efforts, it is almost needless to say, are quite
unavailing. It is also stated that the horse muscle, the
pearl oyster, and some other species of fish, which are
found in great numbers below this fall, are never seen
above it. Trouts, however, have been observed to spring
up the small ascent of Dundaff Linn apparently without
• difficulty.

COWPER'S LINES ON THE RECEIPT OF HIS
MOTHER'S PICTURE.
Ou that those lips had language! Life has passed
With me but roughly since I heard thee last.
Those lips are thine,—thine own sweet smile I see
The same that oft in childhood solaced me;
Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,
“ Grieve not, my child; chase all thy' fears away!"
The meek intelligence of those dear eyes
(Blest be the art that can immortalize,
The art that baffles Time's tyrannic claim
To quench it) here shines on me still the same.
Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,
O welcome guest, though unexpected here !
Who lidst me honour with an artless song,
Affectionate, a mother lost so long.
I will obey, not willingly alone,
But gladly, as the precept were her own:
And, while that face renews my filial grief,
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,
Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,
A momentary dream, that thou art she.
My mother! when I learnt that thou wast dead,
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed ?
Hoverd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,
Wretch even then, life's journey just høgun ?
Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unfelt, a kiss ;
Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss,
Ah, that maternal smile' it answers-Yes.
I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,
And, turning from my nursery window, drew
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
But was it such? It was. - Where thou art
gone,
Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown,
May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,
The parting word shall pass my lips no more !
Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,
Oft gave me promise of thy quick return :
What ardently I wished, I long believed,
And disappointed still, was still deceived.
By expectation every day beguiled,
Dupe of to-morrow even from a child.
Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,
Till all my stock of infant sorrow spent,
I learned, at last, submission to my lot,
But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot.
Where once we dwelt, our name is heard no more,
Children not thine have trod my nursery floor :
And where the gardener Robin, day by day,
Drew me to school along the public way,
Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapt
In scarlet mantle warın, and velvet cap,
'Tis now become a history little known,
That once we called the pastoral house our own.
Short-lived possession! but the record fair,
That memory keeps of all thy kindness there,
Still outlives many a storm, that has effaced
A thousand other themes less deeply traced.
Thy nightly visits to my chamber made
That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid;
Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,
The biscuit, or confectionary plum;
The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed
By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed,
All this, and more endearing still than all,
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,
Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks
That humour interposed too often makes;
All this, still legible in memory's page,
And still to be su to my latest age,
Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay
Such honours to thee as my numbers may;
Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere;
Nut scorn'd in heaven, though little noticed here.
Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours,
When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flowers,
The violet, the pink, and jessamine,
I pricked them into paper with a pin,
(And thou wast happier than myself the while,
Wouldist softly speak, and stroke my head, and smile,)
Could those lew pleasant hours again appear,
Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?
I would not trust my heart,--the dear delight
Stems so to be desired, perhaps I might.
But no, what here we call our life is such,
S, little to be loved, and thuu so much,
That I should ill requite thee to constrain
Thy unbound spirit into bonus again.

King William appointed him his Clerk of the Closet,

Canterbury for that of St. Paul's. On the deposition of
Archbishop Sancroft in 1691 for refusing to take the

reluctantly prevailed upon to accept the See of Canter-

no labour but the sowing, after the necessary prelimi-
naries of cutting down the trees or barking them are
finished. We do not think that the products of Upper
Canada are at all overrated by our author, save perhaps
in the article of fruits, when he tells us (p. 42) that
"pine-apples are raised without trouble, and melons and
grapes grow wild in the woods:" it is of very little im-
portance whether pine-apples can be easily raised or not,
as we are persuaded turnips will prove a more profitable
crop,-but we doubt the fact. As to the wild melons
and the grapes, there is no danger of a man eating them
in a country where bread, meat, and potatoes abound;
otherwise we might put in a word of caution against
them.
Though Martin Doyle has perhaps not been at all in-
clined to underrate the advantages open to an emigrant
into Upper Canada, he has at the same time carefully
avoided all such false views as might seduce the man
who is comfortable at home to try the discomforts in-
separable from settling in a new land. We fully agree
with him in advising those who are well off at home to
stay there, and to weigh all matters carefully before they
think of leaving it. The industrious labourer who
struggles hard against poverty, the skilful carpenter or
shoe-maker, and others of the same class, may, by in-
dustry and perseverance, provide for their families in
Canada, and find a refuge from the threatening evils of
poverty. The single man who is disposed to the same
adventure may lay the foundation of wealth and respect-
ability by a few years of steady labour in the new world,

but were still at a great distance from the foot of the
wall. Their ladder was made fast a second time; but
in the middle of the ascent they met with an unforeseen
difficulty. One of their companions was seized with
some sudden fit, and clung, seemingly without life, to
the ladder. All were at a stand. It was impossible to
pass him. To tumble him headlong was cruel; and
might occasion a discovery. But Crawford's presence
of mind did not forsake him. He ordered the soldier to
be bound fast to the ladder, that he might not fall when
the fit was over; and turning the other side of the
ladder, they mounted with ease over his belly. Day
now began to break, and there still remained a high
wall to scale; but, after surmounting so many difficul-
ties, this was soon accomplished. A sentry observed the
first man who appeared on the parapet, and had just
time to give the alarm before he was knocked on the
head. The officers and soldiers of the garrison ran out
naked, unarmed, and more solicitous about their own
safety, than capable of making resistance. The assail-
ants rushed forward with repeated shouts and with the
utmost fury: took possession of the magazine; seized
the cannon; and turned them against their enemies.
Lord Fleming got into a small boat, and fled all alone
into Argyleshire. Crawford, in reward of his valour
and good conduct, remained master of the castle; and
as he did not lose a single man in the enterprise, he

Fraud and Ingenuity of the Chinese. -An Armenian
merchant brought a pearl of great size and value to Canton,
in the expectation of making his fortune. Its size and
beauty soon became known, and attracted the attention of
the officers and the merchants, who paid their daily visits to
the Armenian, offering him prices far inadequate to its value.
At length, however, after minute and repeated examinations,
a price was agreed upon, and a deposit made, but the Arme-
nian was to keep possession of the pearl till the remaining
part of the purchase-money should be ready; and in order
to obviate any possibility of trick, the box in which it was
kept was sealed with the purchaser's seal. Several days
elapsed without his hearing anything further from the
Chinese; and at length the time approached when all
foreign merchants are ordered down to Macao. The Arme-
nian in vain endeavoured to find out the people who had
purchased his pearl ; but he contented himself with the re-
flection that, although he had been disappointed in the main
object of his journey, he still had his property, and that the
deposit was more than sufficient to defray his expenses. On
reaching his home he had no longer any scruple in breaking
open the seal; but his mortification may easily be supposed,
on discovering that his real pearl had been exchanged for an
artificial one, so very like as not to be detected but by the
most critical examination. The daily visits of these people,

inn called “ Of the Sibyl," from the windows of which his
eye embraces a magnificent cascade, and the elegant an-
tique temples of the Sibyl and of Vesta. The two temples
and the cascade just mentioned are the principal ornaments
of Tivoli. The cascade is produced by the river Anio, now
called the Teverone, which after winding through the
Sabine vales, glides smooth and silently through Tivoli till
it reaches the brink of a precipice, where it throws itself in
one mighty mass of waters down a deep and dark chasm
in the rocks :-there it roars and foams in a narrow chan-
nel, till finding an opening in the rocks it rushes head-
long through it, and descends into caverns and abysses
“deeper and deeper still.” The view of the double fall
which is obtained by descending into the narrow dale
through which the river flows after the cascade is one of
the finest that can be conceived. The whole height of
the cataract is about two hundred feet. The rocks that
resist this tremendous and never-ceasing lashing of the
waters are disposed in a narrow semicircular form; they
are in part clothed with shrubs and foliage, and indented
with romantic caverns; and in one place the river has
worked its way through a rock and formed a natural
bridge, which, whether seen from below, or in passing
over it, is a most peculiar and striking object in the
scene.
On the summit of the lofty and precipitous rock that
flanks this gulf on the right, stands the temple tradi-
tionally, and most probably correctly, called of the Sibyl,
though some antiquaries have chosen to dedicate it to the
goddess Vesta, This truly beautiful pile is circular. It

which Prince Rupert has generally had the credit.
Wren was created LL.D. by the University of Oxford
in 1661, and was knighted in 1674. In 1680 he was
elected to the Presidency of the Royal Society, and in
1685 he entered Parliament as representative of the
borough of Plympton. While superintending the erec-
tion of the cathedral of St. Paul's all the salary that
Wren received was only £200 a year. He was also
used in other respects by the Commissioners with extreme
illiberality and meanness; and at last the ingratitude of
his country, or rather of his times, was consummated
by his dismissal in 1718 from his place of Surveyor of
Public Works. He was at this time in the eighty-sixth
year of his age. This great and good man died at
Hampton Court on the 25th of February, 1723, in the
ninety-first year of his age. His remains were accom-
panied by a splendid attendanee to their appropriate
resting-place under the noble edifice which his genius
had reared ; and over the grave was fixed a tablet with
the inscription in Latin (since placed in front of the
organ,)“ Beneath is laid the builder of this church and
city, Christopher Wren, who lived above ninety years,
not for himself but for the public good. Reader, if
thou seekest for his monument, look around." Amongst
the London Churches which were built from the designs
of Sir C. Wren, one of the most beautiful, as to its
interior, is that of St. Stephen's Walbrook, of which the

following cut may give some notion.
October 20.-On this day in the year 1632, exactly two
centuries ago, was born Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN, the cele-
brated architect of St. Paul's. His birth-place was East
Knowle, in Wiltshire, of which parish his father was rector.
He early gave proof of that ingenuity and aptitude for
scientific pursuits by which he was afterwards so emi-
nently distinguished, having in his thirteenth year in-
vented a new astronomical instrument, and soon after-
wards various other mathematical contrivances. At the
age of fourteen he was sent to Wadham College, Oxford,
and here his remarkable proficiency in various branches
of learning, and especially in the mathematics, soon made
him known to various persons of distinction and influ-
ence. Young as he was at this time, he was one of the
original members of the club which was formed at Oxford
in 1648 for philosophical discussion and experiments, and
which eventually gave rise to the Royal Society. In
1657 he was chosen Professor of Astronomy at
Gresham College; and on the Restoration was appointed
to the Savilian professorship of Astronomy at Oxford.
It was very soon after this that he was first called upon
to exercise his genius in architecture (a study, however,
which had previously engaged a good deal of his atten-
tion) by being appointed assistant to the Surveyor-
General, Sir John Denham, who, in truth, neither knew,
nor pretended to know, anything of the duties of the
office which he held. This led to Wren's employment

fancied might produce a result that would supersede
the slow and laborious process now adopted; but about
eighteen hundred still remain. Four of them have been
unrolled, and fac-similies of them, with translations,
published by the Neapolitan government.
To pass to a very d fferent object. One of the singu-
larities of Naples is its Campo Santo, or cemetery for the
poor. This is situated on the skirts of the town, looking
towards Mount Vesuvius. A wall of inconsiderable ele-
vation encloses a quadrangular space, whose surface is
cut into three hundred and sixty-five holes, like the
mouths of wells or cisterns. One of these holes is
opened every day; the dead bodies of the poor of that
day—without coffins--without so much as a rag about
them-are thrown one upon another, as they arrive,
through the mouth into a deep cave below cut in the
tufa rock, and at night a stone is laid over the horrid
sepulchre and secured by cement. The next day the
care next in order of date is opened, and so on through
the year. At the end of the year, the first cave is again
opened, by which time its contents, the decomposition of
which is assisted by quick-lime, are reduced to little
more than bones.
The catacombs of Naples, whose entrance is under
the hill of Capo-di-Monte, and the grotto of Posilippo,
at the extremity of the western suburb of the city, are
also remarkable objects. The first are of great extent,
and contain many curious specimens of painting and
subterranean architecture by the early Christians, and an
appalling mass of human skulls and bones, the relics of
the victims of a plague that depopulated Naples some
two centuries back. The second is a subterranean
passage cut through the hill of Posilippo in remote an-
tiquity, but enlarged and improved as a road in modern
times. It is considerably more than half a mile long by

bouring parish. He was in the midst of his service on the
Sabbath, when the agitation of the earth gave warning that
some alarming event was to follow. Rusbing from the
church, he saw a peak of the neighbouring mountain alter-
nately heaved up and sinking; the next day, this portion of
the mountain ran down into the plain, Hike melted metal from
a crucible, filling it to such a height, that, as he says, no
more of a, mountain which formerly towered above it could
be seen, than about the size of a bird ; volumes of water
being in the mean time thrown forth in a deluge from the
crater, sweeping away whatever they encountered in their
course. The Oræfa itself then broke forth, hurling large
masses of ice to a great distance; fire burst out in every
direction from its sides; the sky was darkened by the smoke
and ashes, so that the day could hardly be distinguished
from the night. This scene of horror continued for more than
three days, during which the whole region was converted into
utter desolation.— North American Review for July, 1832.
Farming in Iceland.—The most important branch of rural
labour in Iceland, is the hay-making. About the middle of
July, the peasant begins to cut down the grass of the tûn
(the green around his house,) which is immediately gathered
to a convenient place, in order to dry, and, after having been
turned once or twice, is conveyed home on horseback to the
yard, where it is made up into stacks. At the poorer farms,
both men and women handle the scythe; but in general, the
women only assist in making the hay after it is cut. In
many parts of the island, where there is much hay, the

course of nations was so irregular and. imperfect, tra-
velling was almost the only way by which inquisitive
minds could learn anything of foreign countries. At
the same time the main object for which such peregrina-
tions were undertaken seems to have generally been to
seek for patronage. In England, Erasmus had nothing
to depend upon except the liberality of his wealthy friends
and admirers. Of these the most powerful, and also the
most munificent, was Archbishop Warham, who, in 1511,
gave him the living of Aldington in Kent,
and also pro-
cured him the appointment of teacher of Greek at Cam-
bridge. Notwithstanding these benefactions, however,
we find him still engaged in a continual warfare with
poverty. He seems, indeed, to have depended for his
subsistence almost entirely upon the occasional bounty
of his friends ; and it is painful to peruse his fre-
quent and earnest solicitations for assistance from one
or other of them. Sometimes he petitions even for a
few crowns, or notices his receipt of that small sum.
Perhaps there is a good deal of truth in Dr. Jortin's
conjecture, that he was but an indifferent manager,
and had his own imprudence to thank for much of what
he suffered. One circumstance, amusiugly illustrative

BIOGRAPHICAL SKE ICH OF SIR WALTER
of the poet. This mansion was eventually pulled down
SCOTT.
to make way for the new college.
The father of Sir Walter Scott was not a man of
shining talents, but was much esteemed as a steady and
expert man of business, and as a person of great bene-
volence and integrity. He held for many years the
honourable office of elder in the parish church of Old
Grayfriars, of which Dr. Robertson the historian, and
Dr. Erskine, an eminent presbyterian divine, then had
the collegiate pastoral charge. His professional career
was prosperous, and he seems to have early attained ease
if not affluence of worldly circumstances.
The wife of this worthy man, and mother of the poet,
appears from all accounts to have been a more remark-
able person. She was a daughter of Dr. John Ruther-
ford, professor of the practice of Physic in the University
of Edinburgh, and sister of Dr. Daniel Rutherford, Pro-.
fessor of Botany in the same institution, both men of
considerable scientific reputation, and living in habits of
familiar intercourse with the first literary society which
Scotland in their day produced. Besides the advantage
of such connexions, and of an excellent education, Mrs.
Scott possessed superior natural talents, had a good taste
for poetry, and great conversational powers. She is said
to have been well acquainted in her youth with Allan
Ramsay, Beattie, Blacklock, and other Scottish authors
of the last century; and independently of the influence
which her own talents and acquirements may have given
her in training the opening mind of her distinguished
son, it is obvious that he must have been greatly indebted
to her for his introduction, in early life, into the select
literary and intellectual society of which she and her
near relations were ornaments.
Sir Walter was connected, both by the father and

back to the stable she had left in the morning, and no

who came with her from Egypt, followed in a carriage.
She was first placed in a large building called the
Orangery, and was only suffered to walk out in that
division of the garden named the School of Botany,
when the weather was warm and sunny. Nothing
could exceed the curiosity she excited. Her place of
exercise was generally surrounded by 10,000 persons at
a time, and 13,000 more than the usual number of pas-
sengers daily crossed over the Pont d'Austerlitz, which
is opposite to one of the gates of the garden. This
eagerness lasted for many weeks, and not only all the
people of Paris, but of the environs, went to behold the
giraffe. A fresh portrait of her was published every week;
representations of her, in various attitudes, decorated
every box, every fan, and even the ribbons of the ladies ;

Camelopard, as described by naturalists and travellers. We have
to add the following description of the arrival of the Giraffe at

Her neck is furnished with a short black mane, and her
neck, body, and sides of her head are covered with large
brown spots on a white ground. Her tail is small, and
has black hair at the end some inches long. Her feet
are large and cleft, and resemble those of the ox, and
when she walks the two feet on the same side move
together. The giraffe seems to have been especially formed
for browzing on the twigs and leaves of trees. That in the
Garden of Plantz has been fed on maize, beans, and
barley; she is fond of carrots, but her great passion for
roses is remarkable ; she eats them with the greatest
avidity, licks the hands for more, and when the stock is
exhausted looks after those who brought them with
evident disappointment. She now lives in a large round
building, in the middle of the menagerie of the Garden
of Plants, to which is attached a little park, in which she
remains all day when the weather is warm. She is

public are admitted, and directly the weather becomes

Heedless at the ambushed brink
The tall Giraffe stoops down to drink :
Upon him straight the savage springs
With cruel joy!—The desert rings
With clanging sound of desperate strife
For the prey is strong and strives for life;
Now, plunging tries with frantic bound,
To shake the tyrant to the ground;
Then bursts like whirlwind through the waste,
In hopes to 'scape by headlong haste;
While the destroyer on his prize
Rides proudly—tearing as he flies.
For life, the victim's utmost speed,
Is mustered in this hour of need
For life—for life—his giant might
He strains, and pours his soul in flight;
And, mad with terror, thirst, and pain,
Spurns with wild hoof the thundering plain.
'Tis vain; the thirsty sands are drinking
His streaming blood-his strength is sinking,
The victor's fangs are in his veins-
His flanks are streaked with sanguine stains ;
His panting breast in foam and gore
Is bathed He reels—his race is o'er !
He falls—and with convulsive throe,
Resigns his throat to the raging foe;
Who revels amidst his dying moans ;
While, gathering round to pick his bones
The vultures watch, in gaunt array,
Till the gorged monarch quits his prey.

THE OLD CHURCH OF CHELSEA. which do not appear to be of the age of More, but by
another very curious peculiarity. The inscription, writ-
ten by Sir Thomas himself, contains an abstract of his
life from his birth upwards, and, in summing up the
catalogue of his preferments, describes him as having
been at once honoured by being taken into the service of
his king, respected by the nobility, regarded with favour
by the people, and disliked only, it is added, by thieves
and murderers,-after which occurs a blank in the line.
This epitaph, however, as it originally stood, is found in
the folio edition of More's English works, printed in
1557, and also in a collection of tracts and letters by
Erasmus, printed at Antwerp, in 1534, from both of
which authorities it appears that the words here left out
were “ hereticisque," and by herelics. There can be no
question that this expression was omitted in the transcrip-
tion of the epitaph for the new monument, either because
its restoration would not have been permitted in 1644,
or, more probably, because it had long before been
obliterated by protestant zeal from the old monument,
and may not have been known to those who superin-
tended the transcription. More defends the very words
in question in a letter on the subject to Erasmus, and
bis defence is consistent with his general character ;
for, with all his great merits, More was so imbued
with the intolerant spirit of his umes, as to be a
persecutor for religion's sake, even unto death. More
was executed on the 6th of July, 1535, and according
to some authorities, while his head was exposed upon
Temple Bar, his body was brought to Chelsea and de-
posited under this monument. But there is every rea-
son to believe that it was really interred not here but in
the Tower. In this church, however, or, at least, within

animal is very gentle, though it can bite and scratch; and
it may be easily domesticated. The guana is common in
several countries of South America, and it was formerly
found in considerable numbers in the West-İndia Islands;
but the race has there been nearly destroyed, its flesh
being considered a delicious article of food.
This remarkable lizard is easily distinguished from
every other species, by the pouch which hangs from the
under side of its neck, by the indented crest which
reaches from the head to the extremity of the tail, and by
the peculiar beauty of its general colours, and the me-
tallic brilliancy of its scales. Its extreme length, from
the muzzle to the end of the tail, is sometimes five or
six feet. There is a dried specimen in the Museum of
Natural History at Paris, which is four feet long; and
there is a smaller specimen in the British Museum.
The ground colour of the guana is in general green,
mixed with yellow, or various shades of blue ; but the
colours of the species differ considerably in different
individuals, and are probably dependant upon circum-
stances of age, sex, and climate.
The guana feeds on the flowers and leaves of trees,
and on earth-worms and insects. Its jaws are furnished
with teeth, but it swallows its food with scarcely any
mastication. It runs with astonishing nimbleness along
the highest branches of trees; and seldom descends to the
earth, sleeping and feeding on the same tree. The female,
however, at a particular period of the year, goes to the
sea-shore to deposit her eggs in the sand.
After feeding
the guana is very dull, and is then easily taken. In
some places it is hunted by dogs trained to the chace,
and in others taken in a noose or trap. It is extremely
difficult to kill, except in one way that of thrusting a

THE BREAD-FRUIT.
A priceless market for the gathering guest.-BYRON.
[Abridged from Timber-Trees and Fruits, one of the volumes of
the Library of Entertaining Knowledge.]
The earliest account of the bread-fruit is by Captain
Dampier, in 1688. “The bread-fruit,” says this navi-
gator, “ grows on a large tree, as big and high as our
largest apple-trees; it hath a spreading head, full of
branches and dark leaves. The fruit grows on the
boughs like apples; it is as big as a penny loaf when
wheat is at five shillings the bushel; it is of a round
shape, and hath a thick tough rind. When the fruit is
ripe, it is yellow and soft, and the taste is sweet and plea-
sant. The natives of Guam use it for bread. They
gather it when full-grown, while it is green and hard;
then they bake it in an oven which scorcheth the rind,
and maketh it black; but they serape off the outside black
crust, and there remains a tender thin crust; and the
inside is soft, tender, and white, like the crumb of a penny
loaf. There is neither seed nor stone in the inside, but
all of a pure substance, like bread. It must be eaten new,
for, if it be kept above twenty-four hours, it grows harsh
and choky, but it is very pleasant before it is too stale.
This fruit lasts in season eight months in the year, during
which the natives eat no other sort of bread kind. I did
never see of this fruit any where but here. The natives
told us, that there is plenty of this fruit growing on the
rest of the Ladrone Islands; and I did never hear of it
any where else."

his voyages, came home with the most enthusiastic ideas

The Pest-ship slept on her ocean-bed,
As still as any wreck,
Till they all, save one old man, were dead,
In her hold, or on her deck.-
That man, as life around him Aed,
Bow'd not his sturdy neck.
He arose,-the chain was on his hands,
But he climb'd from that dismal place;
And he saw the men who forg'd his bands
Lie each upon his face;-
There on the deck that old man stands,
The lord of all the space.
He sat him down, and he watch'd a cloud
Just cross the setting sun,
And he heard the light breeze heave the shroud,
Ere that sultry day was done;
When the night came on, the gale was loud,
And the clouds rose thick and dun.
And still the negro boldly walk'd

With a step of vengeful pride he stalk'd,
And a sneer was on his lip,-
For he laugh’d to think how Death had baulk'd

At last he slept ;-the lightning flash
Play'd round the creaking mast,
And the sails were wet with the ocean's plash,

From her cable's strain she past.
Away she swept, as with instinct rife,
O'er her broad and dangerous path,

Had gathering sounds of wrath ;
Yet on board that ship was no sound of life,

Save the song of that captive swarth.
THERE was no sound upon the deep,

The breeze lay cradled there;
As the slippery deck he trod;
He fear'd to die in other lands
The motionless waters sank to sleep
Beneath the sultry air;
'Neath a tyrant master's rod;
And he lifted his hard and fetter'd hands
Out of the cooling brine to leap
The dolphin scarce would dare.
In a prayer to the Negro's God.
He touch'd not the sail nor the driving helm,
Becalm'd on that Atlantic plain
But he look'd on the raging sea,
A Spanish ship did lie;
And he joy'd, for the waves that would overwhelm
She stopp'd at once upon the main,
Would leave his spirit free;
For not a wave roll’d by :
And he pray'd, that the ship to no Christian realm
And she watch'd six dreary days, in vain,
Before the storm might flee.
For the storm-bird's fearful cry.
He smiled amidst the tempest's frown,
But the storm came not, and still the ray
He sang amidst its roar;
Of the red and lurid sun
His joy no fear of death could drown,-
Wax'd hotter and hotter every day,
He was a slave no more.

so far as to assert that all objects will appear to us to
stand still, whose velocity or the direction of whose
motion differs so little from our own, as not to cause
any perceptible change in their position or magnitude.
We now proceed to inquire, what apparent motion
will the sledge B have, when its real motion is different
in direction, or in velocity or in both, from that of A?
When we talk of apparent motion as distinguished from
real, we refer to the fact that the spectator always ima-
gines himself to be at rest, unless the motion is either
an act of his own will, or unless he perceives something,
such as the jolting of a carriage, or the motion of the
horses' feet, from which former experience has taught
him to draw a conclusion. Independently of these, his

indication of motion which arises from change of ap: changes. For example
, suppose that the object is at
a motion as would, by itself, produce the observed
parent position. Neither will there be any of that which
arises from change of apparent magnitude, at least if the coming to 1 at the end of the first minute, to 2 at the
rest at B, while the spectator moves from A towards C,

A B is equal to C D, and the two will have continued at

the same distance throughout. Now, the weather re-
inaining the same, the apparent magnitude of an object
depenils upon its distarice alone, growing less as it
recedes, and greater as it approaches; so that if it were
to describe a circle round the spectator, the apparent
magnitude would remain unaltered.. Since then B
aeither changes its apparent position or its apparent mag-
oitude with respect to A, the spectator at A perceives
no indications of motion, and therefore imagines both
are at rest. Generally, if we see neither change of posi-
tion or of apparent magnitude in the objects around us,
we can only conclude, either that, 1. we and the objects
around us are all at rest, or, 2. that we and the objects end of the seco

circle A AA, while B moves round the equal circle he moves from 1 to 2, B will appear to him to move from
BBB with the same velocity; the reader may easily p to q, and so on. That is, any real motion in the
spectator gives, to an object really at rest, an apparent
motion of equal velocity, but contrary direction, to his
own. The apparent motion of the banks of a river, to a
spectator carried along in a boat, is a case in point.
The same proposition may be shown to hold good where
the spectator moves in a curve instead of a straight line.
Thus, if the spectator were carried round a circle, any
fixed object would appear to be carried round the con-
trary way in a circle of equal dimensions. For instance,
we, being carried round on the earth in a circle, from west
to east, imagine that the stars move round us in a circle
from east to west. We shall hereafter enter on the
reasons why we cannot form any distinct idea of the
diameter of this circle.

When the wrung peasant's anxious toil is done,
Among thy bound and golden sheaves to rove,
And glean the harvest of a setting sun,
From the pure mellowing fields of ether won ;

CARISBROOK CASTLE.
THERE are few edifices now remaining in England that
lay claim to so venerable an antiquity as the celebrated
pile of which we are about to give an account. Caris-
brook Castle stands about a mile to the south-west of
Newport, the principal town of the Isle of Wight, and
consequently almost in the centre of the island. It is
erected upon an eminence, from which it overlooks the
town of Carisbrook, now an insignificant village, but
which, before Newport rose into importance, enjoyed
the dignity of metropolis of the Isle of Wight under the
feudal lords who possessed the island until 1291, when
the last descendant of these petty sovereigns, Isabella de
Fortibus, Countess of Devon, and Lady of the Isle of
Wight, (widow of William de Fortibus, Earl of Albe-
marle,) surrendered this portion of her vast inheritance
to King Edward I. whilst lying on her death-bed at her
manor of Lamb-Heth (Lambeth), of which, as well as of
the adjoining manor of Sale-Faux (Vauxhall), she was
the proprietor. It is thought by some antiquaries that
a portion of the present building was of Saxon construc-
tion, as early as the sixth century. After the Norman

jected to any restriction. Hammond then informed him
that orders had been sent down for the instant dismissal
of all his attendants; and they were accordingly com-
pelled to take their leave the day following. As soon as
they were gone, it was further intimated to the unhappy
King that he must for the future consider himself as a
prisoner within the walls of the castle. He was still,
howevor, allowed as much freedom as was compatible
with this species of confinement-being permitted to
walk on the ramparts, and to amuse himself in a bowling-
green, which Hammond caused to be formed for that pur-
pose in a part of the castle-yard. He usually indulged
himself in the former exercise in the morning, and in the
latter in the afternoon. Much of his leisure was also
occupied in reading; his favourite books being the Bible,
the works of Hooker, Bishop Andrews, and Dr. Ham-
mond, Herbert's Poems, the Jerusalem Delivered of
Tasso, in the original, and Fairfax's translation of that
poeni, Ariosto, and Spenser's Fairy Queen. Many per-
sons, it would appear, also still contrived to gain admis-
sion to his presence, under the pretext of desiring to be
touched for the king's evil. The condition in which he
was kept, however, was now undisguisedly that of a pri-
soner; and his thoughts as well as those of his friends
were naturally directed to the means by which he might (Carisbrook Castle ; shewing the window from which Charles I.

of B in the second minute will be from 1" to 2", and so
on. It may seem rather strange, that in this case the
apparent motion of B should be in a line which has no
obvious connexion with A l or B l', but we may in a few
vords, make the result seem highly probable. The
spectator A is moving towards the left edge of the

Again, A 1 2 is in the same direction as the top of the

this appearance will still be preserved in the apparent

the last of these in March, 1629, he was, together with
