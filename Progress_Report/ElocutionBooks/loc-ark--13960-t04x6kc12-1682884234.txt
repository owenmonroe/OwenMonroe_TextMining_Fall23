PREFACE 
 
 The purpose of the author in this book has been to pre- 
 sent the science of human expression in a manner so simple, 
 so concise and so reasonable that no student with average 
 zeal and ability would experience difficulty in comprehending 
 and applying its principles. 
 
 While an effort has been made to render the exposition 
 free from many of the technical and professional theories 
 found in other works, every principle announced and enforced 
 has been drawn from nature by the most scientific researches 
 recognized by the foremost teachers and writers of Europe and 
 America. 
 
 The prominence given to the subject of respiration is justi- 
 fied in the recognition of its three-fold relation to elocution. 
 First, energy and ease of expression are largely dependent upon 
 a proper control of the respiratory organs; second, the cor- 
 rect training of these organs in early life and their judicious 
 exercise at all times, conduce to greater vigor of mind and 
 body than is otherwise possible; and third, the natural sys- 
 tem of breathing during vocalization, reinforced by the teach- 
 ings of science, has been found an almost absolute protection 
 against all forms of lung and throat diseases. 
 
 The skillful use of Slides, Waves and Pauses, and the in- 
 telligent application of emphasis being so essential to intelligible 
 and impressive reading and speaking, much space has been 
 devoted to these subjects. 
 
 Recognizing the justice of much that has been said against

4 PREFACE 
 
 the modern tendency of popular reciters and declaimers to 
 run into the stilted, unnatural and offensively affected, thus 
 bringing the Study of Elocution into disrepute, the author has 
 insisted upon reality, intelligence and genuine human sym- 
 pathy as the basis of all delivery. 
 
 The author hereby acknowledges his sincere thanks to the 
 many writers and publishers who have kindly permitted the 
 use of their excellent selections for this book.

Reading and Elocution 
 
 GENERAL OUTLINE. 
 
 Elocution is the art of conveying thought, sentiment and 
 emotion in the most natural and effective manner. 
 
 Its Purpose. — The complete mastery of its principles en- 
 ables the speaker not only to express his thoughts clearly and 
 easily, but to so vivify and illuminate those thoughts that his 
 hearers see, hear, and feel the unquestioned truth of his state- 
 ments. 
 
 Correct elocutionary training has for its further object the 
 complete subordination of the physical being to the service of 
 the mind and spirit; thought being the product of the inner 
 spiritual man, and speech and gesture its natural outlet through 
 the exterior, or physical man. 
 
 Its Value. — Its study and systematic practice, based upon 
 principle of nature, make the voice clear, strong, flexible and 
 melodious, and gives to the body and limbs a pliancy, vigor 
 and harmony of motion that render the position and action of 
 the speaker or reader at once graceful, natural and impressive. 
 
 How Acquired. — The greatest excellence in Elocution is 
 attained by study, practice, observation and criticism. The 
 student should master the principles by study, and at once test 
 their application by practice. He should closely observe the 
 expression of reputed good readers and speakers — noting the 
 points of excellence and deficiency which characterize their

12 brown's standard elocution 
 
 delivery ; he should frequently submit his own exercises to the 
 criticism of friends and teachers, and make notes of these criti- 
 cisms that they may not again be needed. But one thing must 
 be kept constantly in mind: No amount of instruction and 
 criticism will compensate for a meager drill. The highest ex- 
 cellence in reading or speaking requires the same conditions 
 as music, painting and poetry — Practice, Practice, Practice. 
 
 REQUIREMENTS OF GOOD ELOCUTION. 
 
 1. A full and free respiration. 
 
 2. A correct pronunciation. 
 
 3. A correct and distinct articulation. 
 
 4. A thorough knowledge and perfect control of all the ele- 
 
 ments of vocal expression. 
 
 5. Complete control of every muscle of the face, hands, feet 
 
 and body. 
 
 6. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the 
 
 thought to be expressed. 
 
 7. Perfect self-possession before an audience.

 THE BENEFITS OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 It cultivates the taste and judgment. 
 It cultivates the entire physical system. 
 It quickens perception and apprehension. 
 It imparts grace of movement and attitude. 
 It develops a strong will and self-possession. 
 It strengthens the conception and imagination. 
 It strengthens the lungs and respiratory muscles. 
 It develops vigor of mind and buoyancy of spirit. 
 It gives to the voice purity, power and flexibility. 
 It protects from bronchial and pulmonary afflictions. 
 It prepares the student for the successful prosecution of 
 business in every phase of life. 
 


## p. 13 (#19) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 13 
 
 WHO SHOULD STUDY ELOCUTION. 
 
 All general students. 
 
 Every student of law. 
 
 Those preparing for general business. 
 
 All who are preparing for the ministry. 
 
 The Public Lecturer, Reader or Speaker. 
 
 The instructor in whatever art or science. 
 
 Persons with defective speech or unpleasant voice. 
 
 Persons afflicted with lung and bronchial troubles, huski- 
 
 ness and chronic hoarseness. 
 All who would move through life with the least possible 
 
 friction and attain the greatest success. 
 
 READING. 
 
 i. Reading is the most important branch taught in our 
 schools. It is the key to nearly all the other subjects with 
 which the student and future citizen has to deal. His success 
 in mastering the concomitant branches, and, indeed, nearly 
 every art and science, depends upon the skill he secures at an 
 early age in interpreting, assimilating and retaining the 
 thoughts of others, as presented upon the written or printed 
 page. 
 
 2. The ability to apprehend the wit, the pun, the hidden 
 wisdom beneath the author's words, to grasp the central 
 thought,, to group the lights and shades which modify or orna- 
 ment the worded picture, with the quickness of intuition, must 
 all be acquired in early life. 
 
 3. But to scan the printed page in silence and note in 
 mental concepts the author's woven thoughts is not all there is 
 of reading; nor can the skill by which the thoughts are grasped 
 


## p. 14 (#20) ##############################################

14 brown's standard elocution 
 
 be attained by silent reading alone. Months and years must be 
 given to the vocal utterances of written sentences, under the 
 guidance of skillful teachers, before the child can adapt the 
 written words to his untrained comprehension. Silent and 
 audible reading are mutually dependent ; the highest excellence 
 in either is acquired largely through the practice of the other. 
 
 THE TWO KINDS OF READING. 
 
 All reading may be classed as silent or intellectual, and 
 audible or oral. The purpose of the former is the apprehen- 
 sion of the thought — of the latter, the expression of the 
 thought. As an art, reading includes the interpretation and ex- 
 pression of the thought, sentiment and emotion, as presented 
 in written or printed composition. 
 
 REQUISITES FOR READING. 
 
 Certain requisites for good reading should be considered, 
 and, as far as possible, pupils should be trained in securing 
 these in our elementary schools. Some of these are innate, but 
 all may be cultivated to such a degree as to make intelligent and 
 intelligible readers of ninety-five per cent of all. 
 
 REQUISITES FOR AUDIBLE READING. 
 
 Imitative power. 
 Expressive action. 
 Command of voice. 
 Distinct articulation. 
 Respiratory command. 
 Correct personal habits. 
 All required for silent reading. 
 
 REQUISITES FOR SILENT READING. 
 
 i. A clear conception. 
 2. A quick perception. 
 


## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 15 
 
 3. Human sympathy. 
 
 4. A vivid imagination. 
 
 5. A keen discernment. 
 
 6. An interest in affairs. 
 
 7. Good taste and judgment. 
 
 THE READER'S POSITION. 
 
 Book in the left hand, thumb and little finger in front, 
 first, second and third fingers at the back of the book; the 
 elbow not touching the side. The book should be held in such 
 a manner that a line drawn from the eyes toward the page 
 would intersect the plane of the book at right angles. The 
 full face of the pupil should be seen by the teacher. The 
 weight of the body should be supported, while reading, on both 
 feet, the left heel two or three inches in advance of the hollow 
 of the right foot. The chest should be elevated and expanded, 
 the position erect and easy. 
 
 OUTLINE OF READING WORK. 
 
 i. Give constant attention to pupils' manners, movements, 
 attitudes, breathing, tones and speech. 
 
 2. Devote five minutes daily to concert phonic drill, and 
 critical pronunciation, reviewing the words placed under pro- 
 nunciation. 
 
 3. Require synonyms and derivation of words in each 
 lesson, previously marked. 
 
 4. Have all members of the class commit and properly 
 recite compositions of acknowledged merit. 
 
 5. Require explanation of historical, biographical, geo- 
 graphical, scientific and literary allusions in the text or lessons. 
 All such allusions should be previously designated, that the 
 pupils may have definite knowledge of what is required. 
 
 6. Require an oral abstract of lessons before the exercise 
 


## p. 16 (#22) ##############################################

16 brown's standard elocution 
 
 of reading is called. These synopses must be in the pupils' 
 best language. 
 
 7. To secure the greatest benefit from silent reading, turn 
 to some lesson with which pupils are not familiar, permit them 
 to sketch it hastily — say two minutes to a page — then collect 
 all books and require a written abstract prepared in the shortest 
 time possible. The pupils within a specified time exchange 
 slates or papers and read each other's composition. 
 
 8. The lesson should be read with such precision and ac- 
 curacy as to render the use of a text book in the hands of the 
 teacher unnecessary. 
 
 9. Discuss the style of thought, literary beauty, and 
 rhetorical peculiarity of every selection before leaving it. 
 
 10. Require pupils to learn all they can of every author 
 whose productions they read. 
 
 11. Do not attempt to complete a long selection in one 
 lesson. Few selections in this book can be profitably passed in 
 less than three days. 
 
 TESTS OF RESULTS. 
 
 The average pupil, having fully prepared a reading lesson, 
 should read it with such naturalness and impressiveness as to 
 hold the attention of hearers and inspire them with the most 
 pleasurable emotions. 
 
 RESPIRATION. 
 
 1. Respiration, or breathing, is the act of taking air 
 into the lungs and expelling it from them. 
 
 2. As an art, respiration involves three processes whose 
 mastery by the student is of paramount importance : Inspira- 
 tion, Expiration and Management. 
 
 3. Few persons realize how great is the influence of res- 
 piration upon the growing life of a human being. Notwith- 
 standing the teachings of our text-books and the warnings of 
 


## p. 17 (#23) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 
 
 17 
 
 popular writers and lecturers, many parents and even teachers 
 remain indifferent to the pernicious habits of breathing ac- 
 quired by children during school life. 
 
 4. Vigor of mind and body is de- 
 pendent so largely upon a copious supply 
 of pure air inhaled with reference to time 
 and manner, that no system of education 
 can be carried out successfully unless 
 provision is made for the most complete 
 respiration of the lungs. 
 
 5. It is a fact well established in 
 pathology that functional derangements 
 originating in colds, attack the weakest 
 organs of the body. The properly trained 
 singer and speaker are rarely hoarse. 
 Exemption from lung and throat troubles 
 among professional orators and singers 
 is due to the skillful use of every organ 
 involved in respiration, speech, and song. 
 The public speaker or singer who excuses 
 his performance by confessing hoarse- 
 ness thereby acknowledges his ignorance 
 and violation of one of nature's simplest 
 law r s. 
 
 6. If the teacher or student be disposed to ignore the 
 hygienic value of correct breathing, he is reminded that the 
 highest form of human 'utterance, whether aspirated or vocal- 
 ized in speech, or intonated in measured harmony, is based 
 upon the most intelligent command and use of the respiratory 
 apparatus. The stuttering, gasping, incoherent, flighty, jerky, 
 or impetuous speech, one sometimes hears from a novice in 
 the art of public speaking or singing, is not traceable alone to 
 inexperience, but, in most cases, to nervous embarrassment 
 caused by imperfect respiration.

 7. It may be further stated that a larger part of the train- 
 ing course prescribed for orators and singers in professional 
 schools is devoted to securing command over the breath in 
 speech and song; and that the heart-reaching, soul-stirring 
 rendition of those sublime passages which have in ages past 
 moved the stoic to action and the sage to tears, can be re- 
 produced only, after all other conditions are present, by that 
 perfect adaptation of breath to the molding of words that live, 
 and burn, and glow — melting the heart to tears, filling the ear 
 with rapture, and illuminating the soul with celestial light, 
 until the very air seems filled with seraphic melodies of intelli- 
 gences divine. 
 
 8. Every muscle of the waist, chest, ribs, axilla, back and 
 loins, must be brought into action, and trained by intelligent 
 and persistent practice to perform its function. It will take 
 several months — even years, with older students, to accustom 
 all the muscles to act automatically and effectively. The mind 
 must superintend the effort — must constantly realize the im- 
 portance of the exercise. The expense of time and attention 
 will pay. It will pay in an increased brilliancy of intellect, hap- 
 piness of temper, and buoyancy of spirit. It is the deep, full, 
 vigorous breathers that possess the most vigorous hearts, minds 
 and bodies, 
 
 METHODS OF BREATHING. 
 
 While the ordinary methods of breathing are sufficient for 
 the individual of vigorous outdoor pursuits, they are not suf- 
 ficient for the scholar and man of thought engaged in sedentary 
 pursuits. With these the stimulus generated by bodily action 
 is wanting to induce the deep inspirations peculiar to the active 
 man of outdoor life. The thinker in his study, the artist at 
 his easel, the artisan at his table, and the pupil at his desk, re- 
 quire a constant reinforcement of mental energy. Much more 
 than any of these does the orator demand the recuperative

 agency of a perfect respiration. This requirement can be filled 
 only by the inhalation of an abundance of the vitalizing oxygen 
 contained in pure air ; and art must be called in to supply prop- 
 erly and distribute the regenerative fluid. 
 
 MOUTH VERSUS NOSTRIL BREATHING. 
 
 The following considerations will suggest the propriety of 
 always inhaling through the nostrils : 
 
 i. The small circuitous passages, with many obstructions, 
 through which inhaled air must pass before reaching the deli- 
 cate lung cells, temper it to the normal heat of the body. Air 
 swalloi^ed at the zero temperature enters the lungs many 
 degrees colder than the body, and scarcely fails to produce seri- 
 ous inflammation. 
 
 2. The speaker or singer who incautiously swallow r s air 
 during the exercise of his voice will soon discover a dryness in 
 the mouth, larynx and trachea which will render the tone harsh, 
 hard and husky — annoying to himself and unpleasant to his 
 auditors. The continued moisture of these organs is an essen- 
 tial condition of purity of tone. 
 
 3. The continuous swallowing of air during vigorous 
 speech parches the throat and inflames the membranes and liga- 
 ments of the voice and speech organs. If the practice is re- 
 peated for a few days in succession it results in what is styled 
 "clergyman's sore throat. " 
 
 4. The air at all times is filled with myriads of motes, 
 whose introduction into the delicate lung tissues produces un- 
 pleasant irritation. Added to these, science has demonstrated 
 that, under certain atmospheric conditions, countless germs of 
 disease are floating in the air. These the mouth-breather re- 
 ceives to be carried at once to the lungs and there impart 
 their poison to the blood. The nasal cilia and sieve-like proc- 
 esses which line the nasal cavities arrest the ingress of these 
 life-destroying agents.

 5. To the above may be added the fact that the constant 
 practice of breathing through the nostrils tends to enlarge the 
 nasal passages. This enlargement assists the articulation and 
 adds purity and melody to the tones of the voice. 
 
 RESPIRATORY EXERCISES FOR PRACTICE. 
 
 I. Abdominal Breathing. — Stand passively erect, hands 
 and arms hanging loosely at the sides, weight supported equally 
 on both limbs. Close the lips and inhale 
 quietly and slowly through the nostrils, filling 
 the region about the waist until your capacity 
 is reached. Quietly exhale through the mouth 
 or nostrils as long as possible. Repeat five 
 times. 
 
 2. Chest Breathing. — Repeat the above 
 exercise with the hands clasped behind the 
 head. 
 
 Note. — If dizziness ensue, discontinue for 
 a few minutes. After a few weeks this diffi- 
 culty will not return. 
 
 Caution. — Do not catch the breath sud- 
 denly through the mouth while exercising. 
 During the earlier exercises draw the air 
 through the nostrils very slowly. Permit no 
 air to enter the mouth at any time. God 
 breathed the breath of life into man's nostrils, 
 not into his mouth. 
 
 3. Abdominal and Chest Combined. — 
 Fill the region about the waist as in No. 1, 
 
 then without exhaling, gradually force the enlargement upward 
 until the chest reaches its full expansion. Repeat five times. 
 Reverse the process. 
 
 4. Effusive Exhalation. — Inhale as in No. 1. Exhale in 
 the least audible whisper the sound of "ah" prolonged for 
 
 ABDOMINAL 
 BREATHING 
 


## p. 21 (#27) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 21 
 
 thirty seconds. Continue this exercise daily until the sound can 
 be prolonged fifty seconds. 
 Vocalize "ah" effusively. 
 
 Inhale as in Xo. i. Exhale evenly and in a pure tone the 
 sound of long "e" prolonged for ten seconds. Continue this 
 daily until a clear, musical sound can be continuously produced 
 for thirty seconds. 
 
 Xote. — The longer a speaker can hold his breath the more 
 effective will be his delivery of those long and involved sen- 
 tences whose full force and meaning seems to depend upon 
 an uninterrupted effusion and melodious sound. 
 
 5. Expulsive Exhalation. — Inhale as before. Expel the 
 air in the whispered sound of "h" by a vigorous upward and 
 inward action of the abdominal muscles. Inhale again, and re- 
 peat this exercise ten times without taking breath. 
 
 Inhale ; count clearly and distinctly in one breath to forty, 
 to fifty, to sixty. 
 
 Inhale ; repeat the letters of the alphabet distinctly in a 
 single breath five times, six times. 
 
 6. Explosive Exhalation. — Inhale fully, then expel the 
 air in an explosive whispered utterance of the syllable "huh." 
 The effort must be sudden and exhaust the breath as nearly as 
 possible. 
 
 Inhale ; vocalize with the utmost explosiveness tie syllable 
 "huh." 
 
 Inhale ; laugh explosively in one breath the syllables ha, ha, 
 ha, repeating as many times as possible. When done, shut the 
 mouth instantly and inhale slowly through the nostrils. 
 
 7. Active Chest. — Inhale abdominally; force the en- 
 largement upward, as in No. 3. This is the active chest. It 
 gives the elastic step and energy of speech and action which 
 distinguishes the vigor of eloquence from the languor of in- 
 difference.

 miscellaneous exercises in respiration. 
 
 1. Repeat expulsively in clear tones, in rapid succession, 
 the vowels a, e, 1, 6, u, as many times as you can. In addi- 
 tion to the respiratory benefit accruing from the exercises it 
 gives command of the radical stress, an accomplishment of 
 great importance to the speaker. 
 
 2. Inhale deeply; count in distinct tones to thirty, forty, 
 fifty. Stop the moment the least aspiration is observed. 
 
 3. Take a full breath; repeat distinctly the letters of the 
 alphabet as many times in one breath as possible. 
 
 4. Read in one breath the first paragraph of 'The Two 
 Boot-blacks, " page 58. Afterward read in one breath the 
 first and second paragraphs. Every word must be intelligibly 
 uttered. 
 
 5. Before any public performance, when convenient, go 
 to an open window and with hands placed on window frame 
 inhale and exhale vigorously a dozen or more times. The ex- 
 ercise imparts a healthful stimulation, allays excitement, and 
 gives to the speaker a wonderful reserve force and self-pos- 
 session. 
 
 6. To aerate more thoroughly the lungs, exhale all the 
 air you can and then with the heels of the hands press, by a 
 working motion, the chest, ribs, and sides, under the arm-pits 
 until all the air seems to be driven out. Close the lips and in- 
 hale deeply, evenly and slowly. 
 
 NOTES. 
 
 1. Under no circumstances should the act of breathing be 
 permitted to interfere with vocalization. By proper training 
 and exercise, inhalation can be so managed as rarely to be no- 
 ticed. 
 
 2. In the act of inhalation through the nostrils, avoid the 
 


## p. 23 (#29) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 23 
 
 unbecoming habit of sniffing so noisily as to attract attention. 
 True art conceals art. 
 
 3. Acquire the habit of inhaling slowly. The acquisition 
 of this power brings with it, to a great degree, the control of 
 the breath. 
 
 4. While inhalation is to be effected mainly through the 
 nostrils and imperceptibly, it is understood the acts of sighing, 
 gasping, coughing, sneezing, loud laughter, sobbing, and pant- 
 ing, sometimes accompanying dramatic action, are exceptions. 
 
 5. No breath should be wasted. Use only so much as may 
 be necessary to form the word. Too little renders the sound 
 inaudible ; too much exhausts the speaker and mars the beauty 
 of utterance. 
 
 6. All breath employed in speaking, except in the aspirate 
 quality, should be vocalized. 
 
 7. Do not wait until the lungs are exhausted to take 
 breath. The practice is injurious. Take breath as often as op- 
 portunity will permit. 
 
 8. To secure the greatest benefits from respiratory exer- 
 cises all artificial pressure must be removed from the throat, 
 neck, chest and waist. 
 
 GESTURE. 
 
 Gesture includes all positions and motions of the head, 
 face and limbs, employed to enforce or illustrate an idea, emo- 
 tion, or passion. 
 
 Its Importance. — Gesture is the visible language of the 
 inner life. It portrays to the eye the workings of the mind, the 
 affections of the heart, and the varying passions and emotions 
 of the soul. It is as intelligible to the savage as to the most en- 
 lightened. Entire plays are presented in pantomime and are 
 understood by observers as well as by the players themselves.

 BROWN S STANDARD ELOCUTION 
 
 It gives to the eye what the ear often fails to receive, and thus 
 attracts and holds the attention much more effectually than 
 do words alone. 
 
 He who would successfully appeal to all the senses of his 
 audience — hold the eye, the heart, the soul; summon the ap- 
 proving smile, the sympathetic tear, the rapturous applause; 
 sway, the multitudes, lull them into complacency, or move them 
 to immediate action — must cultivate and skillfully employ this 
 universal language of nature. 
 
 Kinds of Gesture. — All gestures may be classed as Em- 
 phatic, Illustrative, and Locative, 
 
 Emphatic Gesture intensifies assertions by the application 
 of greater force to emphatic words; as, "I will force him to 
 the deed." 
 
 Illustrative Gesture shows the 
 manner, means, degree, appearance, or ef- 
 fect ; as, "Ye gods, withhold your wrath." 
 Locative Gesture designates the 
 position, direction, or place; as, "Look 
 not in the past for hope." 
 
 Requisites of Gesture. — The req- 
 uisites of gesture are Grace, Variety, 
 Simplicity, Boldness, Energy, Precision 
 and Propriety. These must be in har- 
 mony with the accompanying oral ex- 
 pression. 
 
 Initial Movements. — The entrance 
 or first appearance of the speaker before 
 his audience is a critical moment. Im- 
 pressions are then made which often 
 afifect his entire subsequent performance. 
 The Walk. — The walk is the mirror 
 of character. Through it the artist reads 
 the very thoughts the performer would

 conceal ; and though we can change our walk only as we change 
 the temperament that walk portrays, we can by practice secure 
 a style of motion that will occasion no unfavorable comment. 
 Directions. — Stand erect; summon the most animated 
 thoughts; assume active chest (described under Respiration) ; 
 imagine yourself drawn forward by a force acting about the 
 waist; preserve a perfect poise, the head well balanced, the chin 
 neither projected nor retracted.

 power acts at the waist and the knee straightens as the foot 
 strikes the floor.

 after a momentary look into the eyes of the audience, bring the 
 right foot back so as to assume second position, bend the body

 the body bends forward bring the right toe to the heel of the 
 left foot, the right knee bent and pressed firmly against the back 
 of left knee. Step to the left with the left foot and retire. 
 
 Attitudes. — The disposition of the entire figure, when at 
 rest is important, and should receive careful attention. Every 
 posture assumed by the speaker is significant, These should 
 be easy, graceful and flexible, but, above all, they must be in 
 harmony with the prevailing sentiment. 
 
 Head, Body, Hands and Feet, — Stand erect, chest full, 
 head evenly poised, the arms hanging easily at the sides, or one 
 arm at the waist; weight at first supported mainly on both feet, 
 one of which should be

 maining at the same angle. Support the body on the left foot 
 and turn the right so that the feet form an obtuse angle; raise 
 the right heel slightly and balance the body, which is thrown 
 a little forward, with the inside ball of the right foot. 
 
 Changes of Position. — In the delivery of unemotional 
 thought there should be few changes, and all movements should 
 be performed within a limited space. In the expression of 
 emotional thought and heated passion, changes of position, and 
 greater freedom of movement are permissible; yet even here, 
 the speaker must confine himself within the bounds of 
 propriety. The impetuous, headlong, and boisterous plunges 
 up and down the platform suggest not strength and vigorous 
 emotion under the control of a powerful reserve force, but 
 weakness, and instability. Never more until the occasion im- 
 pels you to do so, and you will not go far astray. 
 
 Position of the Head. — The head is presumed to guide 
 the motions of the body, and should be so held as to command 
 the respect of an audience. Its various positions foreshadow 
 the thought before it is expressed. An erect position of the 
 head suggests confidence, dignity and honor ; thrown back, 
 humor, pride or vanity; inclined forward, humility and grief; 
 inclined aside, languor; while a tossing motion implies con- 
 tempt and anger. 
 
 POSITION OF THE HANDS. 
 
 1. The various positions assumed by the hands are highly 
 significant, and should be thoughtfully studied. 
 
 2. In repose the hands should be a model of grace; the 
 forefinger should be gently extended, the thumb extended and 
 nearly parallel with the first finger, the second finger slightly 
 curved, the third finger curved more than the second, and the 
 fourth, or little finger, forming a semi-circle. Study the at- 
 titudes of statuary and adapt your positions to those models 
 that are regarded as specimens of the highest art.

 3. The hand is said to be supine when open, fingers re- 
 laxed and palm upward, indicating entreaty, appeal, light joy- 
 ous emotions and general description. 
 
 4. It is prone when open, fingers extended and palm down- 
 ward ; used in denial, degradation, and concealment. 
 
 5. It is vertical when open, fingers extended the palm out- 
 ward ; used in repelling, disgust, abhorrence, warding off and 
 defining a limit.

 ance and threatening.

 DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. 
 
 Before attempting any of the following exercises in gesture 
 with the hands, the pupil should become familiar with the vari- 
 ous terms used in indicating direction and the significance of 
 such direction. 
 
 1. Front. — Indicating personality, directness, futurity, 
 unity. Gestures made directly before the body are termed 
 "front." 
 
 2. Extended. — Indicating vastness in space, time, quan- 
 tity, or idea. Gestures made directly from the speaker's side 
 are termed "extended." 
 
 3. Oblique. — Indicating a general idea or assertion, in- 
 definiteness. Gestures made between the "front'' and "ex- 
 tended" are called "oblique." 
 
 4. Backward.— Expressive of remoteness of time or 
 space. Gestures back of the extended are called "backward." 
 
 5. Descending. — Expressing determination or empliasis. 
 Gestures made below the horizontal line of the chest are called 
 "descending." 
 


## p. 34 (#40) ##############################################

34 brown's standard elocution 
 
 6. Horizontal. — Pertaining to the intellect. Gestures 
 made by extending the hand and arm in a line horizontal to the 
 chest (whether front, oblique, or the side, or backward) are 
 called "horizontal." 
 
 7. Ascending. — Alluding to the ideal or imaginative. 
 Gestures made above the horizontal are termed "ascending." 
 
 8. Ictus of Gesture. — The ictus of gesture is applied 
 to the accented syllable of the word with which it is used. 
 
 Both Hands, — are often used, making the same motions, 
 to give greater breadth of thought, broader expanse, and more 
 intensity of motion. 
 
 Arm Motions. — To secure facility and grace of gesture, a 
 short preliminary exercise, employing both arms simultane- 
 ously, is of great advantage. Every exercise in gesture should 
 be preceded by several whole-arm movement combinations, the 
 nature of which will be suggested after the following descrip- 
 tion of an exercise the author has used most advantageously 
 with students : 
 
 directions for arm movement. 
 
 Take the first position, Active chest. Let the arms and 
 hands hang naturally, the little fingers just touching the sides. 
 Raise both the arms, bringing the hands toward each other in 
 front, near the body and slightly turning them so that the fore- 
 fingers just touch by the time the hands meet at the waist ; 
 continue raising the hands, fingers relaxed and slightly curved, 
 palms gradually turning inward, until the chin is reached, when 
 the fingers gradually extend. From this point the hands sepa- 
 rate, the whole arms sweep through a graceful curve downward 
 and downward through the horizontal, oblique and extended 
 directions; the palms at first upward, gradually turn inward, 
 then downward, when the arms curve and the hands are 
 brought again together at the waist, as when raised from the

AND SPEAKER

 sides in the initial motion. This movement is to he repeated 
 many times until familiar, and then others which will be of 
 great service in imparting ease and grace to gesture can be 
 developed from it. 
 
 MODE OF GESTURE. 
 
 i. The grace of gesture is expressed in the compound 
 curve, sometimes called "Hogarth's line of beauty. " The 
 motion of the arm originates in the shoulder, is then trans- 
 mitted to the arm, and forearm, whence the hand and the fing- 
 ers receive the impulse and both gradually curving as the arm 
 is raised until the chest (on the side opposite the arm em- 
 ployed) is reached, when the arm, hands and fingers unbend 
 and reach their full extension at the ictus. 
 
 2. The curve of arm gesture, expressive of pleasing, 
 tranquil and serious thought, and employed in narration, de- 
 scription and argument, is beautifully illustrated in the varied 
 motions that may be described with a flexible willow-twig. 
 
 3. The direction of motion in the gesture of violent pas- 
 sion and uncontrollable excitement, whether occasioned by 
 
 anger, fright or joy, is best illustrated 
 in the angular flash of the falling 
 thunderbolt. 
 
 4. From these illustrations the 
 learner will readily infer the char- 
 acter of gesture required when he has 
 determined the sentiment contained 
 in the composition.

 FACIAL EXPRESSION. 
 
 Facial Expression is the adaptation of the countenance to 
 the sentiment to be expressed. 
 
 i. Of the face Quintilian has said: "The face is the 
 dominant power of expression. With this we supplicate; with 
 this we threaten; with this we soothe; with this we mourn; 
 with this we rejoice; with this we triumph; with this we make 
 our submissions ; upon this the audience hang ; upon this they 
 keep theii eyes fixed; this they examine and study even before 
 a word is spoken." 
 
 2. The effect of the vocal delivery is so much heightened 
 by a sympathetic expression of the face, that the student of 
 elocution, whether preparing for the rostrum, bar, or pulpit, 
 should on no account neglect this important aid to his delivery. 
 
 3. While much preliminary training in this department 
 of expression is necessary, in its application the student must 
 first feel the sentiment to be uttered, then the appropriate facial 
 


## p. 45 (#51) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 45 
 
 expression will follow. Beware of useless facial contortions; 
 they are not only inappropriate, they are disfiguring and re- 
 pulsive. 
 
 EXPRESSION OF THE EYES. 
 
 i. The eye is the most expressive of all the features. It 
 is here the mysterious workings of the mind are imaged forth 
 in unmistakable language before the tongue moves in obedience 
 to the will. 
 
 2. From it the soul looks forth and communes with kind- 
 red spirits. The expectant child reads in its mother's eye the 
 answer to its wish. The stricken heart, unable to bear its 
 burden, sends forth its mute appeals for human sympathy 
 through eyes that tell the inward sorrow. 
 
 3. But while philosophers and poets have combined in 
 praise of the wondrous beauty, variety, and expressiveness of 
 the eye, it has, to the orator, peculiar interest which he cannot 
 ignore. It is not simply a means of expression, but to the 
 speaker it is an instrument of control second to no other agency 
 of oratorical power. The speaker who looks directly into 
 the eyes of his audience holds them beyond their power of 
 escape. Every person present feels the magnetic influence of 
 the speaker and fancies himself the particular person addressed. 
 
 4. The failure to use this wonderful power explains why 
 so many desultory speakers and manuscript readers do not 
 secure attention and move their audiences to thought and ac- 
 tion. If you must use a manuscript, acquire the habit of look- 
 ing away from it at times and into the eyes of your hearers.

 GENERAL HINTS UPON GESTURE. 
 
 1. "Suit the action to the word; the word to the action; 
 with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty 
 of Nature." 
 
 2. Be definite and decided in your action. Decision of 
 gesture is more important than grace ; combine the two. 
 
 3. In shifting from one foot to the other avoid dropping 
 one hip or shoulder. 
 
 4. Though appropriate gesture is pleasing to the eye and 
 greatly assists the hearer in comprehending the thought, the 
 pupil is reminded that too little gesture is better than a continu- 
 ous, or even frequent, sawing of the air. 
 
 5. During the action of gesture the arm should be kept 
 moving all the time — rarely stationary for a single instant. 
 
 6. When reading, attempt no gesture unless you can look 
 from your book and preclude the gesture with your eyes. 
 
 7. The ictus of the gesture should be on the emphatic 
 word, and the hand performing the gesture should return to the 
 side or proceed with another gesture. 
 
 8. Keep your face either full or three quarters full toward 
 your audience, unless personation should require it otherwise. 
 
 9. In personating two characters have one speak to the 
 


## p. 50 (#56) ##############################################

60 brown's standard elocution 
 
 right, the other to the left. Explanations require a full face to 
 the audience. 
 
 10. In gesture, use curved lines in all cases except those 
 portraying sudden and impassioned Emotions. 
 
 ii. As a general rule in single gesture, use the right arm, 
 with the right foot advanced in preference to the left. The left, 
 however, is often conveniently used in the mimicry of awkward 
 characters. 
 
 12. Do not permit the love of dress display to mar the 
 effect of your delivery by making you ridiculous. Taste in 
 dress is little less important than appropriate language and de- 
 livery. 
 
 13. Let your changes in gesture accord with the language. 
 The more rapid the thought and violent the emotion, the more 
 sudden the transitions. Calm, dignified and reflective thought 
 requires slow, measured, graceful changes. 
 
 14. When the change of thought requires a change of 
 position, make such change while speaking, not before, nor 
 after ; that is, move as you enter upon the new thought. 
 
 15. Gesture should not accompany the description of the 
 act, but the act itself; as, "But Douglas round him drew his 
 cloak/' etc., receives no gesture ; wait till the words accompany- 
 ing the action are spoken. 
 
 16. Observe the attitudes and gestures of great orators.

 PRONUNCIATION 
 
 Pronunciation from pro. forth, and nuncio, I announce, 
 is the act of vocal and articulate utterance of words 
 according to prevailing usage. 
 
 1. The pronunciation of the English language is not 
 uniform in time or place. The usage of the twentieth cen- 
 tury is not that of the last century. The general style of 
 the bustling metropolis differs from the leisurely uttered 
 words of the field and hamlet. . So, too, the followers of 
 certain occupations manifest their calling by peculiarities 
 of accent and enunciation. The stress and tones of the 
 sea-faring man vary in a marked degree from those of the 
 camp and court. Again, the usage of the mountains is 
 not that of the plains and valleys ; and the contrast 
 between the articulation and accent one hears on the 
 coasts and in the interior is equally marked. 
 
 2. Changes in pronunciation, due to changes in man- 
 ner of living, social and political conditions, advance of 
 commerce and caprice of fashion are constantly going 
 on — in some sections more rapidly than others. While 
 some communities, influenced by the busy activities 
 around them, accept almost every new style of utter- 
 ance, others, more isolated, and, therefore, more tena- 
 cious of early acquirements, resist all innovations, and 
 cling to those familiar sounds to which they have been 
 accustomed. Thus differences in pronunciation originate 
 and continue in the same country. 
 
 3. Notwithstanding these differences in local usage 
 there is a standard of pronunciation to which all critical 
 scholars conform, which in this work is clearly indicated 
 by a simple uniform system of markings and phonetic 
 respellings — each sound being noted by but one dis- 
 tinctive mark. 
 
 i

52 BROWN'S STANDARD ELOCUTION 
 
 4. The "Principles of Pronunciation" contained in these 
 works should be carefully studied by all who aspire to accuracy 
 in spoken English. A mispronounced word or even a pronun- 
 ciation unusually authorized, coming from the pulpit, stage, 
 or rostrum, distracts the hearer's attention, mars the beauty 
 of diction, and compromises the speaker's culture in the. estima- 
 tion of his audience even more than the absence of an eloquent 
 delivery. 
 
 5. Pronunciation comprises articulation, syllabication, and 
 accent. A skillful articulation is acquired by first securing the 
 correct sounds of the vocal elements, and then, by persistent 
 practice, making them so familiar to the tongue and ear that 
 every combination, however difficult, can be sounded instantly 
 and correctly. 
 
 ARTICULATION. 
 
 Articulation is the process of forming and combining the 
 elementary sounds of language. 
 
 1. The importance of this subject entitles it to rank second 
 only to respiration as a requisite to the greatest excellence in 
 the art of elocution. Without this element, cultivated to the 
 highest perfection, all other elements of vocal culture fail to 
 form the accomplished reader and speaker. 
 
 2. Not by the English speaking orator alone, is articula- 
 tion deemed of great importance. French and German teach- 
 ers and statesmen give much attention to the subject. Says 
 Legouve : 
 
 "Articulation and articulation alone, gives clearness, en- 
 ergy, passion and force. Such is its power that it can even 
 overcome deficiency of voice in the presence of a large audi- 
 ence. There have been actors of the foremost rank who had 
 scarcely any voice. Potier had no voice. Monvel, the famous 
 Monvel, not only had no voice, he had no teeth ! and yet no 
 one ever lost a word that fell from his lips; and never was 
 


## p. 53 (#59) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 53 
 
 there a more delightful, more moving artist than he, thanks to 
 his perfect articulation." 
 
 3. That articulation shall secure the greatest benefit to the 
 speaker two conditions must be observed: 
 
 First. It must be correct. 
 Second. It must be distinct. 
 
 4. The first of these implies that the student shall acquaint 
 himself with the powers and applications of all the elementary 
 constituents of the language, in order that he may know the ex- 
 act element required for each oral combination. The second 
 condition demands that he shall so completely master the vocal 
 utterance of every element that no mistake can possibly arise as 
 to what particular sound is uttered. 
 
 5. Correctness of articulation is acquired by frequent 
 reference to standard dictionaries, supplemented by immediate 
 and intelligent practice. Here it should be observed that a dis- 
 tinct articulation without being correct is like legible writing 
 containing many misspelled words ; while it is easily heard, the 
 literary deficiencies of the speaker are made only more ap- 
 parent. 
 
 6. Distinctness of articulation is secured, fifst, by frequent 
 practice upon the exercises prepared for drill, and afterward by 
 constant attention to every word and sentence uttered, until 
 the habit of correct and decided articulation is fixed beyond the 
 necessity of attention. Faulty articulation often arises from an 
 inability to control the speech organs. The remedy is daily 
 practice upon the elementary sounds and syllables. 
 
 7. As to what constitutes a "just articulation," nothing 
 better can be said than the oft-quoted words of Austin: 
 
 "The words are not hurried over, nor precipitated syllable 
 over syllable; nor, as it were, melted together into a mass of 
 confusion ; they are neither abridged nor prolonged ; nor 
 swallowed, nor forced, and, if I may so express myself, shot 
 from the mouth ; they are not trailed nor drawled, nor let slip

 out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They are delivered 
 out from the lips as beautiful coins, newly issued from the mint, 
 deeply and accurately impressed, perfectly finished, neatly 
 struck by the proper organs, distinct, shafp, in due succession, 
 and of due weight." 
 
 8. As the impassioned style of oratory peculiar to the old 
 Greeks and Romans is giving way to the more intellectual and 
 argumentative form of delivery, teachers of the present are 
 giving more attention to ease and precision of speech than did 
 their predecessors. Upon this point, Professor Russell says : 
 
 "The appropriate style of modern eloquence is that of in- 
 tellectual, more than of impassioned expression; and enun- 
 ciation being of all the functions of the voice, that which is most 
 important to the conveyance of thought and meaning, it justly 
 requires, in the course of education, more attention and prac- 
 tice than any other branch of elocution." 
 
 THE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS. 
 
 An elementary sound is a simple vocal element uttered by 
 a single impulse of the voice and speech organs. 
 
 i. The English Language contains forty-five elementary 
 sounds classified as follows: twenty Vocals, or Tonics, sixteen 
 Siibvocals, or Subtonics and ten Aspirates, or Atonies. 
 
 2. Vocals, or Tonics, consist of pure tone modified by 
 the speech organs ; as, a, e, oi. 
 
 3. Subvocals, or Subtonics, consist of tone and breath 
 combined, modified by the speech organs ; as, b, j, ng. 
 
 4. Aspirates, or Atonics, are mere emissions of articu- 
 lated breath; as, /, s, eh. 
 
 5. Cognate Sounds are those formed by the speech 
 organs in a similar position ; as, b and p, d and t. 
 
 6. The student who aspires to accuracy of speech should 
 make himself thoroughly familiar with the sounds and dia- 
 critical marks in the following analysis of letters. 
 


## p. 55 (#61) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 55 
 
 EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION. 
 
 1. The purpose of the following tables is to secure for 
 students correct and distinct articulation, forcible enunciation 
 and an accurate pronunciation. 
 
 2. The first and second accomplishments may be acquired 
 in large classes fully as well as in small ones. Indeed, it has 
 been observed that with timid pupils the concert drill of large 
 numbers is the only effective means of securing that energetic 
 enunciation which contributes so largely to successful vocal 
 culture. 
 
 3. Regarding the importance of the exercises the student 
 may rest assured that to whatever extent he may carry his study 
 and practice in the so-called "embellishments" of elocution, as 
 quality, force, stress, pitch, etc., his skill in these will avail 
 him little if his articulation and pronunciation be defective. It 
 is not enough that the sounds be appropriate and pleasing, and 
 that the pitch, force and stress be in harmony with the senti- 
 ment; the sounds must be accurate, must express the sense, 
 and above all, must be understood by the hearers. 
 
 4. In the exercises in articulation proceed as follows : 
 Inhale deeply ; first pronounce the word distinctly and ac- 
 curately, utter each sound element in its order with energetic 
 force and exaggerated distinctness. 
 
 $, A part of each exercise should be devoted to idiisper- 
 ing the phonic spelling. This may be done by selecting ten or 
 more words for drill, and after vocally uttering the sounds, 
 repeat the same in a forceful whisper. 
 
 6. A portion of every exercise in elocution, should include 
 a few minutes drill in articulation and enunciation. They can 
 not receive too much attention. 
 
 7. Stand erect, the eyes front, the chin slightly dropped, 
 the chest full, the shoulders firm and your mind upon what you 
 are doing.

 EXERCISES IN DIFFICULT COMBINATIONS. 
 
 Indistinct and faulty articulation frequently results from an 
 imperfect command of the brain over the muscles involved in 
 speech ; hence, one of the greatest benefits to be derived from 
 the persistent practice upon difficult combinations is to estab- 
 lish that intimate connection between the mental powers and 
 the physical organs which will permit no uncertain utterance. 
 
 Let the student acquire the power of concentrating his at- 
 tention upon what he is saying, and the difficulties of articula- 
 tion will speedily disappear.

 The Two Boot-Blacks. 
 
 1. A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two little 
 boot-blacks, one white and one black, were standing at the cor- 
 ner doing nothing, when the white boot-black agreed to black

 the black boot-black's boots. The black boot-black was of 
 course willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow boot- 
 black, and the boot-black who had agreed to black the black 
 boot-black's boots went to work. 
 
 2. When the boot-black had blacked one of the black boot- 
 black's boots, till it shone in a manner that would make any 
 boot-black proud, this boot-black who had agreed to black the 
 black boot-black's boots refused to black the other boot of the 
 black boot-black until the black boot-black, who had consented 
 to have the white boot-black black his boots, should add five 
 cents to the amount the white boot-black had made blacking 
 other men's boots. This the boot-black whose boot had been 
 blacked refused to do, saying it was good enough for a black 
 boot-black to have one boot blacked, and he didn't care whether 
 the boot that the boot-black hadn't blacked was blacked or not. 
 
 3. This made the boot-black who had blacked the black 
 boot-black's boot as angry as a boot-black often gets, and he 
 vented his black wrath by spitting upon the blacked boot of 
 the black boot-black. This roused the latent passions of the 
 black boot-black, and he proceeded to boot the white boot- 
 black with the boot which the white boot-black had blacked. 
 A fight ensued, in which the white boot-black who had re- 
 fused to black the unblacked boot of the black boot-black, 
 blacked the black boot-black's visionary organ, and the black 
 boot-black wore all the blacking off his blacked boot in boot- 
 ing the white boot-black. 
 
 PRONUNCIATION TEST. 
 
 An Indian attracted by the aroma of the coffee and the 
 broth, arising from the bivouac moving down the path, met a 
 bombastic bravo who was troubled with the bronchitis. The 
 Indian being in dishabille, was treated w T ith disdain by this 
 blackguard, who called him a dog, and bade him with much 
 vehemence and contumely to leave his domain, or he would 
 demonstrate by his carbine the use of a coffin and cemetery. 
 The Indian calmly surveying the dimensions of his European 
 opponent, and being sagacious and robust, and having all the 
 combativeness of a combatant, shot this ruffian in the abdomen 
 with an arrow.

 museum, laughingly said, bravo ! you should be nationally re- 
 warded by receiving the right of franchise, for I witnessed the 
 altercation, and the evidence is irrefragable and indisputable 
 that you have removed a nauseous reptile. I now make this 
 inquiry — will not the matrons in this country, and the patrons 
 of our schools, inaugurate some system that will give an im- 
 petus to the interesting study of our language? If half the 
 leisure moments were thus spent in lieu of reading some 
 despicable romance, we should we wiser than we are.

 COMMON ERRORS IN PRONUNCIATION 
 
 1. Among: many persons there exists a constant ten- 
 dency to mispronounce certain combinations of sounds. 
 This tendency arises from one of several causes and occa- 
 sionally from all. It may be caused, first, by an imperfect 
 apprehension of the sound ; second, an inability to repro- 
 duce the sound, and third, a careless indifference. 
 
 2. To overcome the first and second difficulties, train 
 the ear to discover the true sound and to detect the error, 
 and the speech organs to execute the sound correctly. 
 The only remedy for the third cause is an appeal to the 
 student's sense of propriety. 
 
 3. The faults are represented in part by the follow- 
 ing" words. Use them as a drill.

VOICE AXD SPEECH CULTURE. 
 
 i. Voice is the audible vibrations heard in the air passing 
 from the lungs into and through the vocal organs. The air is 
 driven from the lungs as from a bellows by the action of the 
 respiratory muscles; and after receiving the vibratory motion 
 in the larynx and resonance in the pharynx, the peculiar sound 
 termed voice is produced. Speech is made of voice by the 
 proper articulations of the speech organs. 
 
 2. The highest skill in speech is attained only by a per- 
 fect control of the voice and speech organs. 
 
 3. The chief requisite in securing 'great vocal power is an 
 erect and easy posture of the body, giving expansiveness to the 
 chest and freedom to the limbs, and that absolute command of 
 the breath which will enable the speaker to utter one hundred 
 or more syllables in a single breath. 
 
 4. To secure the greatest compass and flexibility the stu- 
 dent should not confine his practice to low notes, under the 
 impression that thus only can he acquire the full, rich volume 
 he so much admires in some favorite speaker. The exercises 
 must include every interval between the highest and lowest 
 notes. Practice in all degrees and tones gives compass and 
 flexibility. Flexibility and decision of speech are secured 
 largely by frequent practice upon passages requiring the utmost 
 rapidity of utterance. 
 
 5. Cultivate particularly pleasant tones and correct and 
 distinct articulation. Avoid falling into the habit of a drony 
 enunciation and a drowsy, drawling speech, or the offensive 
 
 tones of AFFECTATION.

 6. In your public vocal performances, be deliberate. 
 Leave nothing unfinished. The mind, not the organs involved, 
 must control the speech. 
 
 7. Huskiness, harshness and hardness of tone result from 
 the contact of air inhaled during vocal exercises with the lining 
 mucous membrane of the speech organs ; no air whatever should 
 enter the mouth. Keep the mouth constantly moist. This will 
 not be difficult if you inhale through the nostrils, and employ 
 all exhaled air in phonation. 
 
 8. The nasal passages should be kept constantly open. 
 Proper breathing and cleanliness will secure this condition. 
 
 9. Fullness, depth, richness and flexibility of tone are so 
 largely dependent upon the control of the tongue, throat, and 
 jaw muscles that constant attention should be given to the free 
 action of these muscles. 
 
 10. To render words most easily understood by those re- 
 mote from the speaker, the mouth should be opened freely and 
 fully, and should not be closed too suddenly in finishing 
 syllables. 
 
 11. During reading and speaking care should be exercised 
 to avoid a continued pitch too high, too low, or a monotone. 
 The last reacts upon the speaker, rendering his delivery dull and 
 lifeless; a pitch too low usually prevents understanding the 
 words ; while a prolonged high pitch exhausts the speaker and 
 wearies an audience beyond its capacity of enjoyment. The 
 pitch should follow the general law of thought development — 
 curves, slides and waves — few planes. 
 
 12. To prevent embarrassment, arising from nervousness, 
 inhale and exhale to your utmost capacity a number of times 
 before attempting to use the voice in public. The same pre- 
 caution will materially prevent incoherency, stuttering and 
 stammering in extemporaneous speech. 
 
 13. Finally, avoid the so-called "modern elocutionist's 
 style" which seems to reach its perfection of unreality in a

 Human Sympathy. — The student is here reminded that 
 however vigorous his enunciation, however accurate his articu- 
 lation, appropriate his quality, force, pitch and movement, one 
 element of success may be lacking. This is genuine human 
 sympathy. The ear may be pleased by harmonious sounds, the 
 eye fascinated by graceful gestures, and even the intellect may 
 tacitly acknowledge the speaker's art, but the soul, that priest- 
 ess of the inner temple, can not be deceived by outward show. 
 The stifled breath, the palpitating heart, the moistened eye 
 respond not to skillful movements and artistic sounds, but to 
 the stricken heart — the suffering soul whose agonies the speak- 
 er's looks and feelings vivify. 
 
 VOICE PRESERVATION. 
 
 1. Do not throat your voice. 
 
 2. Consign tobacco to the mutes. 
 
 3. Constantly cultivate pure tones. 
 
 4. Avoid a long continued high pitch. 
 
 5. Use no drinks during vocal exercise. 
 
 6. Use no stimulants or acids of any kind. 
 
 7. Breath as directed under Respiration. 
 
 8. Keep the mind and body pure and healthy. 
 
 9. Avoid affectation, arrogance, and irritability. 
 
 10. Keep the temper as a reserve force, under control. 
 
 11. Permit no compression about the neck, waist or chest.

MODULATION. 
 
 Modulation is the ready and perfect adaptation of the 
 appropriate elements of speech to the sentiment designed to be 
 conveyed. 
 
 i. The skillful modulation of the voice requires an in- 
 stantaneous and imperceptible transition from one quality to 
 another, an easy increase or decrease of force, a ready change 
 of stress, and a perfect command of every degree of pitch and 
 movement. 
 
 2. The good reader or speaker varies the element of ex- 
 pression so skillfully that the hearer gets a suggestion of the 
 meaning of the words by the very nature of the sound in which 
 they are uttered. 
 
 MODE OF UTTERANCE. 
 
 Voice is vocalized breath and as such its formation depends 
 upon the method of exhalation employed in phonation and 
 speech. 
 
 As there are three methods of forcing the air from the 
 lungs, termed effusive, expulsive, and explosive, so there are 
 three modes of utterance derived from the manner of expir- 
 ation, and named : 
 
 i. Effusive Utterance, in which the tone is gently and 
 evenly effused from the vocal organs without abruptness. It 
 is the characteristic tone of tranquillity, pathos, grandeur, 
 devotion, 
 
 2. Expulsive Utterance, in which the tone is projected 
 from the vocal organs with more or less abruptness, according 
 
 74 
 


## p. 75 (#81) ##############################################

AM) SPEAKER 75 
 
 to the intensity of feeling accompanying speech. It ranges in 
 use from ordinary description and narration to the highest 
 forms of argumentative discourse. 
 
 3. Explosive Utterance, in which the tone is shot forth 
 with an instantaneous burst like the crack of a rifle. The 
 abrupt shock peculiar to the explosive is produced by a 
 momentary restraint of the breath in the glottis followed by an 
 irresistible upward action of the respiratory muscles. This 
 mode of utterance is employed in the expression of sudden 
 anger, terror, ecstasy, command. 
 
 Application. — No one mode of utterance is likely to be 
 appropriate to an entire composition. The effusive is rarely 
 found in more than two or three consecutive w T ords. The 
 expulsive is more common than the others, being employed in 
 the greater part of every conversation. 
 
 EXERCISES IN MODES OF UTTERANCE. 
 EFFUSIVE UTTERANCE. 
 
 Sublimity, reverence. 
 
 Father, thy hand 
 Hath reared these venerable columns ; thou 
 Did'st weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down 
 Upon the naked earth, and forthwith rose 
 All these fair ranks of trees. They in thy sun 
 Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze, 
 And shot toward heaven. The century-living crow, 
 Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died 
 Among their branches ; till at last they stood, 
 As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark, 
 Fit shrine for humble worshiper to hold 
 Communion with his Maker.

 Joyous exclamation. 
 
 Go, ring the bells, and fire the guns, 
 And fling the starry banner out ; 
 
 Shout "freedom" till your lisping ones 
 Give back their cradle-shout ; 
 
 Let boasted eloquence declaim 
 
 Of honor, liberty, and fame; 
 
 Still let the poet's strain be heard, 
 
 With "glory" for each second word, 
 
 And everything with breath agree 
 
 To praise "our glorious liberty."

 Brazen bells ! 
 What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells ! 
 In the startled ear of night 
 How they scream out their affright ! 
 Too much horrified to speak, 
 They can only shriek, shriek, 
 Out of tune, 
 In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
 In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, 
 Leaping higher, higher, higher, 
 With a desperate desire, 
 And a resolute endeavor, 
 Now — now to sit, or'never, 
 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
 O the bells, bells, bells ! 
 What a tale their terror tells 
 Of despair!

 SLIDES. 
 
 Slides, sometimes termed inflections, are concrete changes 
 of pitch, either upward ( / ) or downward ( \ ) on a single 
 element or word. They vary in extent of elevation or depres- 
 sion accoiding to the nature of the sentiment. 
 
 i. The purpose of slides is to convey more accurately those 
 delicate shades of meaning found in abstract reasoning, un- 
 emotional description and narration, to give clearness to con- 
 trasted ideas, and vigor to expressions of earnestness, emotion 
 and passion. 
 
 2. In addition to the service rendered in the apprehension 
 of the thought by the correct use of slides, their judicious em- 
 ployment gives a beauty, variety and melody to speech which, 
 when artistically applied, is as pleasing to the ear as the most 
 artistic variations of music and song. 
 
 3. The importance of slides is shown in the fact that many 
 actors, public readers and teachers of expression prepare com- 
 positions for delivery and teaching by marking nearly every 
 passage with the appropriate voice slides. The author's ex- 
 perience with hundreds of students confirms the opinion that 
 the skillful application of slides and waves contributes to in- 
 telligible delivery more than any one element the orator may 
 employ. 
 
 4. While many will appreciate the value of slides in 
 adding clearness to reading and speaking, the student is re- 
 minded that the recognition of a requisite, does not imply a 
 natural ability to command and properly to employ the appro- 
 priate slide. Indeed, many young people of superior intelli- 
 gence and fair attainments in our high schools and colleges are 
 found who can neither apply the required slide when indicated 
 nor imitate it when given by their instructor, without much 
 practice. 
 
 5. Xo marked degree of excellence in expressive reading

 may be expected until the student has given much time to the 
 practice and intelligent study of the principles governing 
 voice slides. 
 
 UPWARD SLIDE. 
 
 The Upward Slide is an elevation of voice through the con- 
 crete change of pitch, the degree of elevation depending upon 
 the intensity of the thought or emotion. 
 
 GENERAL LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Upward Slide is employed upon the accented syllable 
 of those words used singly, in phrases or in sentences, denoting 
 indifference, uncertainty, incompleteness, doubt, contingency, 
 negation, direct interrogation, tenderness^ pathos, surprise, 
 wonder, anticipation. 
 
 PRINCIPLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 
 
 The Upward Slide is used in — 
 
 I. Direct questions; as, 
 
 Would you make men trustworthy ? 
 
 Do you refuse me justice ! — audience — even? 
 
 Note. — A repetition of a direct question requires the down- 
 ward slide; as Did you go home? What did you say? Did 
 you go home? 
 
 II. Emphatic interrogative repetitions; as, 
 Looked as if I guessed his meaning? 
 I'm always wanting money for clothes ? 
 
 III. Words and phrases of informal address; as, 
 John, bring me your book. 
 
 Maclaine ! you've scourged me like a hound. 
 
 Note. — A formal or emphatic address requires the down- 
 ward slide ; as, Fellow citizens : It is no ordinary cause, etc. 
 O comrades! Warriors! Thracians! 
 


## p. 79 (#85) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 79 
 
 IV. Expressions of negation, implying contrast; as, 
 He is not a man of words. 
 
 I did not say a younger man. 
 
 V. Anticipative phrases or clauses; as, 
 
 To become wise and learned, requires study. 
 
 He that can not bear a jest should not make one. 
 
 VI. Expressions of indifference ; as, 
 You may go if you wish. 
 
 What do you wish to see? Oh, nothing. 
 
 VII. Words of pathos, entreaty, gentle reproof; as, 
 He moaned so pitifully, I couldn't chide him. 
 John, I'm very sorry you've disregarded my wishes. 
 
 VIII. Unimportant particulars, except the last; as, 
 Pride costs more than hunger, third and cold. 
 John, Henry, James and Charles are present. 
 
 IX. Expressions of doubt, contingency and uncertainty ; as, 
 There is a possibility of the train's being late. 
 
 Good advice were better if well followed. 
 
 X. Contrasts introduced by adverbial "as" ; as, 
 Night brings out stars, as sorrow show T s us truth. 
 As we rise in glory, w T e sink in pride. 
 
 DOWNWARD SLIDE. 
 
 The Downward Slide is a downward movement of the 
 voice through the concrete change of pitch, the degree of 
 depression depending upon the completeness, exactness, or defi- 
 niteness of the thought in the speaker's mind. 
 
 GENERAL LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Downward Slide is employed upon those syllables used 
 singly, in phrases or in sentences denoting completeness, de- 
 termination, certainty, command, passion, positive and decisive 
 declaration. 
 


## p. 80 (#86) ##############################################

80 brown's standard elocution 
 
 principles and illustrations. 
 
 The Downward Slide is used in — 
 
 I. Answers to direct or indirect questions; as, 
 Did you go home ? No, I did not. 
 
 Who discovered the Mississippi? De Soto discovered it. 
 
 Exception. — If the person addressed is indifferent, he will 
 usually answer with an upward slide; as, 
 
 Did you enjoy your vacation? Oh, yes, pretty well. 
 Do you regard her as handsome ? Yes, passably so. 
 Which way shall we walk? I am not particular. 
 
 II. Declarative, imperative and exclamatory sentences; as, 
 Great beggars are said to be little doers. 
 
 Confess your faults ; a fault confessed is half redressed. 
 
 III. Completeness of thought in principal or subordinate 
 
 clauses; as, 
 
 Did ye not hear it ? — No ; 'twas but the wind, 
 
 Or the car rattling o'er the stony street. 
 
 On with the dance ! let joy be unconf ined ; 
 
 No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet 
 
 To chase the glowing hours with flying feet : 
 
 But, hark ! that heavy sound breaks in once more, 
 
 As if the clouds its echo would repeat; 
 
 And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before ! 
 
 Arm 5 arm ! it is — it is the cannon's opening roar ! 
 
 IV. Language of determination and certainty ; as, 
 We shall attack the fort at sunrise. 
 
 I know the power of freedom, I rejoice in her majesty. 
 
 Y. Impassioned exclamations; as, 
 
 To arms ! they come ! the Greek ! the Greek. 
 Hence, horrible shadow ! Unreal mockery, hence ! 
 


## p. 81 (#87) ##############################################

AND SPEAKER 81 
 
 VI. Direct interrogation anticipating the answer yes or no; 
 
 as, 
 
 Have I not treated your as a gentleman? Yes, 
 Have we ever failed to keep our faith? No. 
 
 VII. Emphatic and repeated direct or indirect questions; 
 
 as, 
 
 Why have you disobeyed my commands? 
 Will you stop that distressing noise? 
 
 YIII. Each member, except the last, of a commencing 
 series; as, 
 
 The wisdom of the philosopher, the eloquence of the his- 
 torian, the sagacity of the statesman, the capacity of the gen- 
 eral, may produce more lasting effects upon human affairs, but 
 they are incomparably less rapid in their influence, and less 
 intoxicating from the ascendancy they confer, than the art of 
 oratory. 
 
 IX. Each member, except the last but one, of a concluding 
 
 series; as, 
 Let a child read and understand such stories as the friend- 
 ship of Damon and Py'thias, the integrity of Aristides, the 
 fidelity of Regulus, the purity of Washington, the invincible 
 perseverance of Franklin, and he will think and act after the 
 manner of the world's greatest benefactors. 
 
 X. Members of sentences expressing affirmation and 
 
 negation have opposite slides; the affirmative mem- 
 ber has the downward slide, the negative the up- 
 ward; as, 
 
 I am here to act, not to talk. 
 
 I am here not to talk, but to act.

 twisting or crooked motion of the tone in passing over the 
 vowels, is a compound movement of voice on a single syllable, 
 word or sentence. 
 
 classification of waves. 
 
 The Upward Wave, expressive of completeness, is the 
 union of the Upward and Downward Slides; as, ah. 
 
 The Downward Wave, expressive of incompleteness, is the 
 union of the Downward and Upward Slides; as, ah. 
 
 Waves may be Single, consisting of the two Slides only, 
 Upward or Downward ; or they may be 
 
 Multiple, consisting of any number of Slides greater than 
 two, beginning with either the Upward or Downward Slide. 
 
 Waves may be Equal when the voice slides equally in both 
 directions, or they may be 
 
 Unequal, when the voice slides unequally in both direc- 
 tions. 
 
 APPLICATION OF WAVES. 
 
 The Upward Single Equal Wave expresses astonishment, 
 admiration; as, Ah ! beautiful ! 
 
 The Downward Single Equal Wave expresses scorn, con- 
 tempt, ridicule, mockery, sneer; as, You a soldier! 
 
 Unequal Slides are employed to increase the intensity of 
 emotions. 
 
 Multiple Waves, in addition to increasing the intensity of 
 expression, mark a progressiveness of emotion that produces a 
 most startling impression upon the hearer. For illustrations of 
 multiple waves see sentences with diagrams below.

 EXTENT OF WAVES. 
 
 Wave of the Second Upward or Downward, rarely un- 
 equal, have the least perceptible change of pitch. It is the 
 gentle undulation of voice through the interval of two notes. 
 In the expression of grandeur, sublimity, and devotion with 
 subdued force, it gives to the voice a beauty, harmony, and 
 impressiveness found nowhere else in the whole range of 
 earthly sounds. Without it the solemn service of the church 
 and the grandeur of the inspired Word become meaningless 
 cadences or painful monotony. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Wave of the Secoxd, employed with a subdued force 
 and low pitch, is used to express dignified admiration, mild con- 
 trast, gentle yet all pervading emotions of reverence and awe, 
 sentiments of beauty, sublimity, grandeur, devotion and ador- 
 ation. 
 
 Drill frequently on the following beautiful stanza: 
 
 There the life-fires brighten, J and burn | and roll, 
 O'er diamonds \ that sparkle | o'er sands of gold, 
 Where | to breathe the sweet air | yields a bliss untold, 
 And the dwellers | immortal | shall never grow old. 
 
 ["God's Beautiful City.'—B. F. Taylor.] 
 
 The Wave of the Third, Upward or Downward, Equal 
 or Unequal, rises or falls through an interval of three notes. It 
 is the characteristic wave of playful wit, humor, and good- 
 natured raillery. Its peculiar deflections refer the mind back- 
 ward or forward to some implied or unexpected witticism. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Wave of the Third expresses mirth, wit, jest, drol-

 lery, insinuation, double meaning, affectation, mimicry, strong 
 contrast. 
 
 Example :— 
 
 A duchess ! You shall be a queen — to all 
 Who, by the courtesy, will call you so. 
 
 Wave of the Fifth and Octave. A voice wave direct, 
 inverted, equal or unequal, passing through a fifth or an octave, 
 is termed emotional, or impassioned. It is characteristic of the 
 greatest mental and physical agitation. Confined within the 
 speaker's compass, restrained by will and controlled by judg- 
 ment, it becomes one of the most potent accompaniments of 
 invective, vituperation, scorn, sarcasm, and mockery, which a 
 speaker can employ. It rarely occurs in modern literature. 
 It is found mostly in the drama. As a voice building exercise, 
 giving facility in impressive transitions, it is superior to any 
 other single effort required of the student. Daily practice in 
 all the waves, closing with the octave, should be insisted upon 
 throughout the course. 
 
 law of use. 
 
 The Wave of the Fifth and Octave is used to express 
 irony, sarcasm, satire, sneer, ridicule, astonishment, intense in- 
 terrogation, amazement, scorn, mockery, disgust, contempt, 
 malice, hatred, revenge.

 pauses. 
 
 Pauses are temporary suspensions of speech between words, 
 phrases and clauses. 
 
 1. Pauses serve three purposes: 
 
 1. To convey the speaker's meaning clearly; termed Sen- 
 tential. 
 
 II. To increase the effectiveness of delivery; termed 
 Emotional. 
 
 III. To add embellishment to the composition; termed 
 Rhythmical. 
 
 2. The primary use of pauses is to set off the divisions of 
 thought — to arrange the ideas with respect to each other so that 
 the mind of the hearer can grasp their relations to each other 
 and to the thought as a whole. 
 
 3. Without frequent and appropriate pauses speech is but 
 


## p. 88 (#94) ##############################################

88 brown's standard elocution 
 
 a monotonous succession of zuords whose related significance 
 must be obtained only by great mental effort; while their 
 judicious employment arouses and rivets the attention, quickens 
 the perception and makes the receiving of truth acceptable for 
 the pleasure afforded in hearing it. 
 
 4. No combination of words, however rhetorically ar- 
 ranged, however well delivered with reference to all the em- 
 bellishments of elocution can be made to produce an effect so 
 impressive, so thrilling, as a profound pause made amid the 
 stillness of a breathless audience. If speech is sometimes 
 silver, a pause is golden; if the former is grand the latter is 
 awful — sublime. 
 
 5. Punctuation marks, sometimes termed "grammatical 
 pauses/' indicate the syntactical structure of the sentence, but 
 do not necessarily locate or determine the length of pauses. 
 The reader gathers the sense of a passage by the aid of punctu- 
 ation and applies the appropriate pause according to the nature 
 of the sentiment, modified by attending circumstances of time, 
 place and occasion. 
 
 6. A good reader will make many more pauses than are 
 indicated by the punctuations, and will sometimes pass over 
 such marks without any pause. In the sentence "No, sir, there 
 is none," a pause between "no" and "sir" would be im- 
 proper. 
 
 7. The length of pauses is dependent wholly upon the 
 nature of the* thought, sentiment, or emotion. As a general 
 rule, lively, playful thought and joyous, excited emotions re- 
 quire short pauses ; commonplace sentiments, ordinary de- 
 scription and narration require moderate pauses; while long 
 pauses are appropriate to solemn, serious thought and emotions 
 of sublimity and awe.

 PAUSES IN POETRY. 
 
 The principles governing pauses, as stated above, apply to 
 nearly every form of vocal expression, whether prose or poetry. 
 The rule requiring a slight pause at the end of every line of 
 poetry is misleading, and results in that sing-song style so com-

 mon among children and illiterates. The rhythm must not be 
 made so prominent as to obscure the sense. Poetic measure 
 may embellish thought, but it can not supplant it in expression. 
 
 The terms caesura and demi-caesura should not be regarded 
 as pauses, but as divisions of the rhythmical structure of the 
 poetic line. Unless the sense requires a pause, regard neither 
 these divisions nor the punctuation marks. Observe the fol- 
 lowing rule : In reading poetry, unless the sense requires a 
 pause, let the voice delicately poise at caesuras, demi-caesuras 
 and the end of each line. 
 
 A vocal poise is effected by a gentle swell and pivotal move- 
 ment of tone to the next word or line. 
 
 QUANTITY. 
 
 Quantity is the measure of time occupied in the utterance 
 of single syllables and words. 
 
 1. Whatever importance may be attached to the peculiar 
 meaning to be given individual words, no marked success will 
 be attained until the element of quantity is mastered. 
 
 2. It is observed that the untrained speaker can not make 
 the short sounds short enough nor the long sounds sufficiently 
 long. His attempts in the first efforts result in incoherency, in 
 the second, drawling. 
 
 All syllables may be classed as : 
 
 1. Indefinite: Capable of being indefinitely prolonged. 
 
 2. Immutable: Incapable of prolongation. 
 
 3. Mutable: Capable of a slight degree of prolongation.

 Indefinite syllables, requiring Long Quantity, are employed

 emphasis. 
 
 Emphasis is that peculiar utterance of words, phrases and 
 clauses which renders them especially prominent or significant. 
 
 i. The importance of Emphasis in determining the mean- 
 ing of a sentence may be inferred from an examination of the 
 following sentence which, by placing the emphasis upon the 
 marked words, is capable of expressing seven different mean- 
 ings : 
 
 4. John did not say you bought that book; Henry said so. 
 
 2. John did not say you bought that book ; he wrote it. 
 
 3. John did not say yon bought that book; but that your 
 sister bought it. 
 
 4. John did not say you bought that book; but that you 
 found it. 
 
 5. John did not say you bought that book; but this book. 
 
 6. John did not say you bought that book; it was your 
 slate. 
 
 7. John did not say you bought that book ; he said nothing. 
 
 2. Emphasis is effected by a change of quality, force, 
 stress, pitch, sliding, waves, movement, or quantity, or by 
 lengthening the pauses. Usually two or more of these elements 
 are employed to produce the required emphasis. 
 
 3. Perfect command of every variety of emphasis depends 
 upon an accurate perception of the sentiment and its relation to, 
 and connection with, every other thought with which it is asso- 
 ciated, and skill in the control of all the elements of vocal 
 expression previously explained. 
 
 4. The most common method of applying emphasis is by 
 an increase of force, but that is by no means the only method. 
 Pupils should guard against its use where it would not be indi- 
 cated by the sentiment. Many instructors teach their pupils 
 that "Emphasis is an increase of force." It is not always an 
 


## p. 95 (#101) #############################################

AND SPEAKER 95 
 
 increase of force. The etymology of the word signifies "to 
 show," "to indicate;" and emphasis may be shown by diminish- 
 ing the force as well as by increasing it. It may be shown by 
 raising or lowering the pitch, and by accelerating or retarding 
 the movement. 
 
 GENERAL LAWS GOVERNING EMPHASIS. 
 
 i. The subject, predicate and object in sentences much in- 
 volved usually receive slight emphasis ; as, 
 
 Maud Midler, on a summer's day. 
 Raked the meadow sweet with hay. 
 
 2. All words introducing new ideas are moderately em- 
 phasized; as, 
 
 "He mounted into literature from the moment that he fell." 
 
 3. Words expressing contrasts or antithesis are emphatic; 
 as, 
 
 The sweetest pleasure is that of imparting pleasure. 
 The noblest mind the best contentment has. 
 Love lights more fires than hate extinguishes. 
 
 4. All words which seem to contain the principal ideas of 
 the thought should be indicated by emphasis ; as, 
 
 "The crear conception, outrunning the deductions of logic, 
 the high purpose, the firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speak- 
 ing on the tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feat- 
 ure, and urging the whole man onward, right onward to his 
 object — this, this is eloquence ; or rather, it is something greater 
 and higher than all eloquence — it is action, noble, sublime, god- 
 like action." 
 
 5. In repetition each succeeding word receives greater 
 force than the word preceding ; as, 
 


## p. 96 (#102) #############################################

96 brown's standard elocution 
 
 Strike — till the last armed foe expires ; 
 Strike — for your altars and your fires; 
 STRIKE — for the green graves of your sires ; 
 God and your native land. 
 
 Note. — This rule applies also to cumulative emphasis ; as, 
 
 Forward, the Light Brigade! 
 CHARGE FOR THE GUNS ! 
 
 6. The intensity of absorbing emotions is best shown by 
 emphasis efifected by pauses; as, 
 
 "He shudders — gasps — Jove help him — so, — he's dead!" 
 
 7. Words of exclamation usually require the strongest 
 emphasis ; as, 
 
 "Hence! horrible shadow! 
 Unreal mockery, hence ! 
 
 Note. — Even when one member of the antithesis is omitted 
 the expressed member is made emphatic ; as, 
 
 "An attentive student would not make such blunders. " 
 
 exercises in emphasis. 
 
 Quality: — 
 
 I hate him for he is a Christian. (Guttural.) 
 
 Give me liberty or give me death? (Aspirate.) 
 
 Quoth the raven, "Nevermore" (Pectoral.) 
 
 And the sisters, they murmured, "For Shame!" (Falsetto.) 
 
 Force: — 
 
 I repeat it, sir, the charge is false. (Increase.) 
 But on the way it burst, it fell; and lo! 
 A skeleton! (A decrease of force.) 
 


## p. 97 (#103) #############################################

AND SPEAKER 97 
 
 Stress: — 
 
 Back to thy punishment, false fugitive. (Radical.) 
 Softly sleep and breathe the odors sweet. (Median.) 
 Fret till your proud heart break. (Final.) 
 Must I budge? Must / observe you? (Compound.) 
 Charge for the guns! Charge! (Thorough.) 
 May God forgive me: I have been to blame. (Intermit- 
 tent.) 
 
 Pitch:— 
 
 "It snows!" cries the school-boy. "Hurrah!" and his shout. 
 Is ringing through parlor and hall. (Raising of pitch.) 
 Read on her urn, "A broken heart!' 
 This tells her tale. (Lowering of Pitch.) 
 
 Movement: — 
 
 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you — 
 trippingly on the tongue. (Fast.) 
 
 There on a snow-white couch, 
 
 Lay his two sons, pale, pale and motionless. (Slow.) 
 
 Pause: — 
 
 The old, old fashion — Death. 
 
 MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES IN EMPHASIS. 
 
 By a proper application of emphasis find the true meaning 
 of the following sentences : 
 
 1. Mr. Davis told John to saddle his horse, and John sad- 
 dled him. 
 
 2. The dog would have died if they hadn't cut off his head. 
 
 3. A fellow in a market town most musical cries razors up 
 and doivn. 
 
 4. Now, therefore, the said witness (says the said 
 Thomas) is a thief. 
 


## p. 98 (#104) #############################################

98 brown's standard elocution 
 
 5. He had a patient lying at Death's door, 
 
 Some three miles from the town, it might be four. 
 
 6. A man who is in the daily use of ardent spirits, if he 
 doesn't become a drunkard, is in danger of losing his health 
 and character. 
 
 7. O, fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the proph- 
 ets have written of me. 
 
 8. Hang out our banners on the outward wall ; 
 The cry is "Still they come." 
 
 9. A man going to sea, his wife desired the prayers of the 
 congregation. 
 
 SLUR. 
 
 Slur is a smooth, rapid, subdued movement of voice over 
 certain words, phrases and clauses of less importance than 
 others with which they stand associated. 
 
 The object of Slur is to bring out the principal thought of 
 a passage as contained in the leading clause by a subdued force 
 and rapid movement over the subordinate, or auxiliary clauses. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Slur is applied to passages expressing contrast, repeti- 
 tion, explanation, modifications of persons, things, time, place, 
 cause, manner and degree, and all parenthetical expressions. 
 
 Note. — Let the student place curves around slurred pas- 
 sages in the following selection and read correctly : 
 
 The Worth of Eloquence. 
 
 1. Let us not, gentlemen, undervalue the art of the orator. 
 Of all the efforts of the human mind, it is the most astonishing 
 in its nature and the most transcendent in its immediate 
 


## p. 99 (#105) #############################################

AND SPEAKER 99 
 
 triumphs. The wisdom of the philosopher, the eloquence of 
 the historian, the sagacity of the statesman, the capacity of 
 the general, may produce more lasting effects upon human 
 affairs, but they are incomparably less rapid in their influence 
 and less intoxicating from the ascendancy they confer. 
 
 2. In the solitude of his library, the sage meditates on the 
 truths which are to influence the thoughts and direct the con- 
 duct of men in future times; amid the strife of faction, the 
 legislator discerns the measures calculated, after a long course 
 of years, to alleviate existing evils or produce happiness yet 
 unborn ; during long and wearisome campaigns, the commander 
 throws his shield over the fortunes of his country, and pre- 
 pares, in silence and amid obloquy, the means of maintaining 
 its independence. But the triumphs of the orator are im- 
 mediate ; his influence is instantly felt ; his, and his alone, it is, 
 
 "The applause of listening senates to command, 
 The threats of pain and ruin to despise, 
 To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, 
 And read his history in a nation's eyes." 
 
 3. "I can conceive/' says Cicero, "of no accomplishment 
 more to be desired than to be able to captivate the affections, 
 charm the understanding, and direct or restrain, at pleasure, 
 the will of whole assemblies." This single art, amongst every 
 free people, has commanded every encouragement and been 
 attended with the most surprising effects ; for what can be more 
 astonishing than that from an immense multitude one man 
 should come forth, the only, or almost the only, man who 
 can do what nature has made attainable by all ? Or, can any 
 thing impart to the ears and the understanding a pleasure so 
 pure as a discourse which at once delights by its elocution, 
 enlists the passions by its rhetoric, and carries captive the con- 
 viction by its logic ? 
 
 4. What triumph more noble and magnificent than that 
 


## p. 100 (#106) ############################################

100 brown's standard elocution 
 
 of the eloquence of one man swaying the inclinations of the 
 people, the consciences of judges and the majesty of senates? 
 Nay, further: can aught be esteemed so grand, so generous, 
 so public-spirited, as to relieve the suppliant, to raise up the 
 prostrate, to communicate happiness, to avert danger, to save 
 a fellow-citizen from exile and wrong? Can aught be more 
 desirable than to have always ready those weapons with which 
 we can at once defend the weak, assail the profligate, and re- 
 dress our own or our country's injuries? 
 
 5. Apart from the utility of this art in the forum, the 
 rostrum, the senate, and on the bench, can any thing, in 
 retirement from business, be more delightful, more socially 
 endearing, than a language and elocution agreeable and pol- 
 ished on every subject? For the great characteristic of our 
 nature, that which distinguishes us from brutes, is our capacity 
 of social intercourse, our ability to convey our ideas by words. 
 Ought it not, then, to be pre-eminently our study to excel man- 
 kind in that very faculty which constitutes their superiority 
 over brutes? 
 
 6. Upon the eloquence and spirit of an accomplished orator 
 may often depend, not only his own dignity, but also the wel- 
 fare of a government; nay, of a people. Go on, then, ye who 
 would attain this inestimable art. Ply the study you have in 
 hand, pursue it with singleness of purpose, at once for your 
 own honor, for the advantage of your friends, and for the serv- 
 ice of your country 
 
 QUALITY OF VOICE. 
 
 The term Quality of Voice is applied to the nature, charac- 
 ter, or kind of tone used. 
 
 Quality of voice is wholly independent of force, stress, or 
 pitch. Its distinguishing characteristic is the place of reverbera- 
 tion or resonance. This depends upon the state of mind or 
 


## p. 101 (#107) ############################################

AND SPEAKER 101 
 
 physical condition of the speaker. Hence, the quality em- 
 ployed becomes a valuable aid in the portrayal of thought, senti- 
 ment, and emotion. 
 
 Eight qualities of the voice are commonly recognized, 
 namely : 
 
 PURE TONE PLAINTIVE GUTTURAL NASAL 
 
 OROTUND PECTORAL ASPIRATE FALSETTO. 
 
 PURE TONE. 
 
 The Pure Tone is a clear, pure, smooth, round, musical 
 tone, the reverberations being confined wholly within the 
 mouth. 
 
 In its production, all the breath employed is converted into 
 tone free from aspiration and harshness. 
 
 The Pure Tone is illustrated in nature by the joyous songs 
 of birds and the merry ringing laugh and gleeful tones of chil- 
 dren. 
 
 DIRECTIONS FOR SECURING PURE TONE. 
 
 Shape the mouth and lips in such a manner as to form the 
 sound of oo in ooze, the tongue lying low and concave upper- 
 most so as to form the largest mouth cavity. Utter the sound 
 of oo several times with your conversational pitch. 
 
 To test the purity of tone, while practicing, place the back 
 of the hand within three inches of the mouth. If any air is 
 felt to strike the hand your tone is not pure. Purse the lips 
 less and repeat. 
 
 PURE TONE.

 derness, in solemn, serious, tranquil, narrative, didactic, and 
 descriptive thought, in calling, and in joyous and mirthful emo- 
 tions. 
 
 The Three Cherry-Stones. 
 
 Narration and Description. 
 
 Narrative and descriptive, appealing to the fancy, senti- 
 ment, and imagination. It requires, according to the vivid- 
 ness of the thought or scene, great variety of slides, portraying 
 the constantly changing picture and development of incident. 
 Use a pure tone and conversational style. 
 
 1. Three young gentlemen, who had finished the most sub- 
 stantial part of their repast, were lingering over their fruit 
 and wine at a tavern in London, when a man of middle age, 
 and middle stature, entered the public room where they were 
 sitting, seated himself at one end of a small unoccupied table 
 and, calling the waiter, ordered a simple mutton chop and a 
 glass of ale. 
 
 2. His appearance, at first view, was not likely to arrest 
 the attention of any one. His hair was beginning to be thin 
 and gray ; the expression of his countenance was sedate, with 
 a slight touch of perhaps, melancholy; and he wore a gray 
 surtout with a standing collar, which manifestly had seen 
 service, if the wearer had not, — just such a thing as an officer 
 would bestow upon his serving man. He might be taken, 
 plausibly enough, for a country magistrate, or an attorney of 
 limited practice, or a school-master. 
 
 3. He continued to masticate his chop and sip his ale in 
 silence, without lifting his eyes from the table, until a cherry- 
 stone, sportively snapped from the thumb and finger of one of 
 the gentlemen at the opposite table, struck him upon his right 
 ear. He eye was instantly upon the aggressor, and his ready 
 intelligence gathered from the ill-suppressed merriment of the 
 party that this petty impertinence was intentional. 
 
 4. The stranger stooped, and picked up the cherry-stone 
 and a scarcely perceptible smile passed over his features as he 
 carefully wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and placed it in 
 


## p. 103 (#109) ############################################

AND SPEAKER 103 
 
 his pocket. This singular procedure, with their preconceived 
 impressions of their customer, somewhat elevated as the young 
 gentlemen were by the wine they had partaken of, capsized 
 their gravity entirely, and a burst of irresistible laughter pro- 
 ceeded from the group. 
 
 5. Unmoved by this rudeness, the stranger continued to 
 finish his frugal repast in quiet, until another cherry-stone, 
 from the same hand, struck him upon the right elbow. This 
 also, to the infinite amusement of the other party, he picked 
 from the floor, and carefully deposited with the first. 
 
 6. Amidst shouts of laughter, a third cherry-stone was 
 soon after discharged, which hit him upon the left breast. This 
 also he very deliberately took from the floor, and deposited 
 with the other two. 
 
 7. As he rose, and was engaged in paying for his repast, 
 the gaiety of these sporting gentlemen became slightly subdued. 
 It was not easy to account for this. Lavater w 7 ould not have 
 been able to detect the slightest evidence of irritation or resent- 
 ment upon the features of the stranger. He seemed a little 
 taller, to be sure, and the carriage of his head might have 
 appeared to them rather more erect. He walked to the table 
 at which they were sitting, and, with that air of dignified calm- 
 ness which is a thousand times more terrible than wrath, drew 
 a card from his pocket, and presented it with perfect civility 
 to the offender, who could do no less than ofifer his own in 
 return. 
 
 8. While the stranger unclosed his surtout, to take the card 
 from his pocket, they had a glance at the undress coat of a 
 military man. The card disclosed his rank, and a brief in- 
 quiry at the bar was sufficient for the rest. He was a captain 
 whom ill health and long service had entitled to half -pay. In 
 earlier life he had been engaged in several afifairs of honor, 
 and, in the dialect of the fancy, was a dead shot. 
 
 9. The next morning a note arrived at the aggressor's 
 residence, containing a challenge, in form, and one of the 
 cherry-stones. The truth then flashed before the challenged 
 party, — it was the challenger's intention to make three bites 
 at this cherry, three separate afifairs out of this unwarrantable 
 frolic ! The challenge was accepted, and the challenged party, 
 in deference to the challenger's reputed skill with the pistol, 
 had half decided upon the small sword; but his friends, who

 were on the alert, soon discovered that the captain, who had 
 risen by his merit, had, in the earlier days of his necessity, 
 gained his bread as an accomplished instructor in the use of 
 that weapon. 
 
 10. They met, and fired alternately, by lot; the young man 
 had selected this mode, thinking he might win the first fire. 
 He did — fired, and missed his opponent. The captain leveled 
 his pistol and fired — the ball passed through the flap of the 
 right ear, and grazed the bone ; and, as the wounded man in- 
 voluntarily put his hand to the place, he remembered that it 
 was on the right ear of his antagonist that the cherry-stone 
 had fallen. Here ended the first lesson. A month had passed. 
 His friends cherished the hope that he would hear nothing 
 more from the captain, when another note — a challenge of 
 course — and another of those ominous cherry-stones arrived, 
 with the captain's apology, on the score of ill-health, for not 
 sending it before. 
 
 11. Again they met — fired simultaneously, and the captain, 
 who was unhurt, shattered the right elbow of his antagonist, — 
 the very point upon which he had been struck with the cherry- 
 stone; and here ended the second lesson. There was some- 
 thing awfully impressive in the modus operandi, and exquisite 
 skill of his antagonist. The third cherry-stone was still in his 
 possession, and the aggressor had not forgotten that it had 
 struck the unoffending gentleman upon the left breast. A 
 month had passed — another — and another, of terrible suspense ; 
 but nothing was heard from the captain. Intelligence had been 
 received that he was confined to his lodging by illness. 
 
 12. At length the gentleman who had been his second in 
 the former duels once more presented himself, and tendered 
 another note, which, as the recipient perceived on taking it, 
 contained the last of the cherry-stones. The note was super- 
 scribed in the captain's well-known hand, but it was the writ- 
 ing evidently of one who wrote feebly. There was an unusual 
 solemnity also in the manner of him who delivered it. The 
 seal was broken, and there was the cherry-stone in a blank 
 envelope. 
 
 "And what, sir, am I to understand by this?" inquired the 
 aggressor. 
 
 "You will understand, sir, that my friend forgives you — 
 he is dead !"

 Solemnity. 
 
 Solemnity requires nearly the same elements of expression 
 as Pathos, with lower pitch and slower movement of voice — 
 the greater the solemnity the lower the pitch and the slower 
 the movement. Let the waves be full and impressive, the 
 quality pure and round and free from affectations. God's 
 Beautiful City is very suitable for a closing piece. 
 
 1. Far, far away, amid realms of light, 
 Hid deep in the azure beyond our sight, 
 Stands a beautiful city so high and bright, 
 Where is known no sorrow, nor death nor night. 
 
 Beautiful City ! 
 Oh, blest abode, oh, home of God ! 
 Whose streets by the feet of the sinless are trod. 
 
 2. They roam through the gardens of endless spring, 
 They crowd all thy portals, on rushing wing, 
 While the echoing domes of the palace ring 
 With the hymns of the angels that shout and sing. 
 
 Beautiful City! 
 Hark ! hark again ! the angelic strain, 
 As gleams through the crystal, that burnished train. 
 
 3. There the life-fires brighten, and burn, and roll. 
 O'er diamonds that sparkle o'er sands of gold, 
 Where to breathe the sweet air yields a bliss untold, 
 And the dwellers immortal shall never grow old. 
 We pierce the skies with longing eyes, 
 
 And yearn to inherit the golden prize. 
 
 4. It is said that the King, in his power sublime, 
 When the last sands drop from the glass of time, 
 And our world shall be robed in its Eden prime, 
 Will bring down that city to gladden earth's clime.

 Bright capital where saints shall dwell, 
 And reign on the throne with Immanuel.

 The expression of didactic thought is addressed to the judg- 
 ment and reason through the intellect; and while fewer vocal 
 embellishments are required than in description and narration, 
 the logical connection of terms and accuracy of statement de- 
 mand the utmost precision of utterance and purity of tone, 
 Deliver with sincere earnestness.

 Pathos is designed to awaken in the hearer emotions of 
 sympathy for the person or object represented. The require- 
 ments are a clear conception of the conditions described, genu- 
 ine sympathy, purity of tone, and effusive utterance of the 
 particularly expressive words. The slides and waves rarely 
 reach the note of a third. The rising slide prevails in the 
 more intensely pathetic parts. Avoid anything like "show" — ■ 
 be natural. 
 
 1. Little Dombey had never risen from his little bed. He 
 lay there, listening to the noises in the street, quite tranquilly ; 
 not caring much how the time went, but watching it and 
 watching everything. 
 
 2. When the sunbeams struck into his room through the 
 rustling blinds, and quivered on the opposite wall, like golden 
 water, he knew that evening was coming on, and that the sky 
 was red and beautiful. As the reflection died away, and a 
 gloom went creeping up the wall, he watched it deepen, deepen, 
 deepen into night. Then he thought how the long unseen 
 streets were dotted with lamps, and how the peaceful stars 
 were shining overhead. His fancy had a strange tendency to 
 wander to the river, which he knew was flowing through the 
 great city ; and now he thought how black it was, and how deep 
 it would look reflecting the hosts of stars ; and, more than all, 
 how steadily it rolled away to meet the sea.

 3. k Tloy! What is that?" 
 "Where, dearest ?" 
 
 "There ! at the bottom of the bed." 
 "There's nothing there, except papa!" 
 
 The figure lifted up its head and rose, and, coming to the 
 bedside, said : 
 
 4. "My own boy ! Don't you know me?" 
 
 Paul looked it in the face. Before he could reach out both 
 his hands to take it between them and draw it towards him, 
 the figure turned away quickly from the little bed, and went 
 out at the door. 
 
 The next time he observed the figure sitting at the bottom 
 of the bed, he called to it. 
 
 "Don't be so sorry for me, dear papa. Indeed, I am quite 
 happy !" 
 
 5. His father coming and bending down to him, he held 
 him round the neck, and repeated these words to him several 
 times, and very earnestly; and he never saw his father in his 
 room again at any time, whether it were day or night, but he 
 called out, "Don't be so sorry for me! Indeed, I am quite 
 happy !" 
 
 6. How many times the golden water danced upon the 
 wall, how many nights the dark river rolled towards the sea in 
 spite of him, Paul never sought to know. 
 
 7. One night he had been thinking of his mother and her 
 picture in the drawing room down stairs. The train of thought 
 suggested to him to inquire if he had ever seen his mother. 
 For he could not remember whether they had told him yes 
 or no, the river running very fast, and confusing his mind. 
 
 8. "Floy, did I ever see mamma?" 
 "No, darling; why?" 
 
 "Did I never see any kind face, like a mamma's, looking 
 at me when I was a baby, Floy?" 
 "O yes, dear!" 
 "Whose, Floy?" 
 "Your old nurse's. Often." 
 
 9. "And where is my old nurse? Show me that old nurse, 
 Floy, if you please !" 
 
 "She is not here, darling. She shall come to-morrow." 
 "Thank you, Floy!"

 io. Little Dombey closed his eyes with these vvo<vfs, and 
 fell asleep. When he awoke the sun was high, and thr, broad 
 day was clear and warm. Then he awoke, — woke mind and 
 body, — and sat upright in his bed. He saw them now about 
 him. There was no gray mist before them, as there had 
 been sometimes in the night. He knew them every one, and 
 called them by their names. 
 
 ii. "And who is this? Is this my old nurse!" asked the 
 child, regarding, with a radiant smile, a figure coming in. 
 
 Yes, yes. No other stranger would have shed those tears 
 at sight of him, and called him her dear boy, her pretty boy, 
 her own poor blighted child. No other woman would have 
 stooped down by his bed, and taken up his wasted hand, and 
 put it to her lips and breast, as one who had some right to 
 fondle it. No other woman would have so forgotten every- 
 body there but him and Floy, and been so full of tenderness 
 and pity. 
 
 12. "Floy! this is a kind, good face! I am glad to see it 
 again. Don't go away, old nurse. Stay here! Good by!" 
 
 "Good by, my child?" cried Mrs. Pipchin, hurrying to his 
 bed's head. "Not good by?" 
 
 "Ah, yes! Good by! — Where is papa?" 
 
 13. His father's breath was on his cheek before the words 
 had parted from his lips. The feeble hand waved in the air, 
 as if it cried "Good by !" again. 
 
 "Now lay me down ; and, Floy, come close to me, and let 
 me see you." 
 
 14. Sister and brother wound their arms around each 
 other, and the golden light came streaming in, and fell upon 
 them, locked together. 
 
 "How fast the river runs, between its green banks and the 
 rushes, Floy ! But, it's very near the sea now. I hear the 
 waves ! They always said so !" 
 
 15. Presently he told her that the motion of the boat upon 
 the stream was lulling him to rest. Now the boat was out at 
 sea. And now there was a shore before him. Who stood on 
 the bank ! —

 ing else stirred in the room. The old, old fashion! The

 OROTUND QUALITY. 
 
 The Orotund is the Pure Tone deepened and intensified to 
 its utmost magnitude, with the resonance in the chest. 
 
 The Orotund is so called in allusion to its roundness and 
 fullness of tone. It is the voice of grandeur, emanating from 
 the loftiest emotions which animate the soul. It is esteemed 
 the highest perfection of human utterance, and, while natur- 
 ally possessed by few, it may be cultivated by all. Both the 
 Orotund and Pure Tone should possess mellowness, sweet- 
 ness, sympathy, attractiveness, smoothness and penetrating 
 power. 
 
 DIRECTIONS FOR ACQUIRING OROTUND QUALITY. 
 
 Stand erect, depress and enlarge the larynx as if trying to 
 swallow some large object. Prolong the sound of a in awe, 
 using medium low pitch. Hold the organs firmly as directed, 
 but avoid any constriction of the muscle about the throat and 
 neck. 
 
 Xote. — The student is cautioned against attempting the 
 grand, swelling orotund in the opening parts of declamations 
 and orations. 
 
 Modes of Utterance. — The Orotund may be uttered ef- 
 fusively, expulsively or explosively.

 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Orotund quality is employed in the expression of 
 emotions of grandeur, sublimity, reverence, adoration, devotion, 
 azve; in earnest, bold, grand, and lofty thought; in abrupt and 
 startling emotions of daring, warning, courage, inspiration and 
 in the fierce outbursts of passion.

 Apostrophe to the Ocean, 
 lord byron. 
 
 Effuskc Orotund. 
 
 The rendition of the more profound emotions of grandeur, 
 sublimity, reverence, adoration and awe demands a full, deep, 
 sonorous, effusive orotund, with long quantity, low pitch and 
 slow movement, free from all impurity of tone and abrupt 
 slides and waves. 
 
 The following poem will furnish an excellent exercise for 
 cultivating the deep and flowing orotund : 
 
 i. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! 
 Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain ; 
 Man marks the earth with ruin; his control 
 
 Stops with the shore ; upon the watery plain 
 The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain 
 
 A shadow of man's ravage, save his own, 
 When, for a moment, like a drop of rain, 
 
 He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan, 
 Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined and unknown. 
 
 2. The armaments which thunderstrike the w 7 alls 
 
 Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake, 
 And monarchs tremble in their capitols, 
 
 The oak leviathans whose huge ribs make, 
 Their clay creator the vain title take 
 
 Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war; — 
 These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake. 
 
 They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar 
 Alike the Armada's pride or spoils of Trafalgar. 
 
 3. Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee ; 
 
 Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they? 
 Thy waters wasted them while they were free, 
 And many a tyrant since ; their shores obey

 The stranger, slave or savage; their decay 
 Has dried up realms to deserts ; not so thou, 
 
 Unchangeable, save to thy wild waves' play; 
 Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow ; 
 
 Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now. 
 
 4. Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form 
 
 Glasses itself in tempests; in all time, 
 Calm or convulsed — in breeze, or gale, or storm — 
 
 Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime 
 Dark-heaving; boundless, endless and sublime — 
 
 The image of eternity — the throne 
 Of the invisible; even from out thy slime 
 
 The monsters of the deep are made; each zone 
 Obeys thee ; thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone ! 
 
 5. And I have loved thee, Ocean ! and my joy 
 
 Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be 
 Borne, like thy bubbles, onward; from a boy 
 
 I wantoned with thy breakers ; they to me 
 Were a delight; and if the freshening sea 
 
 Made them a terror, 'twas a pleasing fear 
 For I was, as it were, a child of thee, 
 
 And trusted to thy billows far and near, 
 And laid my hand upon thy main, as I do here.

 Expulsiz'c Orotund.

 orotund, with full force and deliberate movement. To ef- 
 fectively produce the vigorous, compact tones required in the

 oratorical style of delivery, strike each important word with an 
 energetic expulsion of air. This is accomplished by a vigorous 
 inward and upward action of the abdominal muscles. This 
 selection is well adapted for securing that fullness of volume 
 peculiar to the orotund. Much time may profitably be given to 
 the drill. 
 
 i. All hail to our glorious ensign! courage to the heart 
 and strength to the hand, to which, in all time, it shall be 
 instructed ! May it ever wave in honor, in unsullied glory, 
 and patriotic hope on the dome of the capitol, on the country's 
 stronghold, on the entented plain, on the wave-rocked topmast. 
 
 2. Wherever, on the earth's surface, the eye of the 
 American shall behold it, may he have reason to bless it ! On 
 whatsoever spot it is planted, there may freedom have a foot- 
 hold, humanity a brave champion, and religion an altar! 
 Though stained with blood in a righteous cause may it never 
 in any cause be stained with shame ! 
 
 3. Alike, when its gorgeous folds shall wanton in lazy hol- 
 iday triumphs on the summer breeze, and its tattered frag- 
 ments be dimly seen through the clouds of war, may it be the 
 joy and pride of the American heart ! First raised in the cause 
 of right and liberty, in that cause alone may it forever spread 
 out its streaming blazonry to the battle and the storm ! Hav- 
 ing been borne victoriously across the continent and on every 
 sea, may virtue and freedom and peace forever follow where it 
 leads the way !

 force and high and very high pitch. Let the tones be sharp, 
 ringing, clear and incisive. In the following selection only the 
 impassioned speeches of Marmion and Douglas are uttered 
 with explosive orotund. 
 
 i. Not far advanced was morning day, 
 When Marmion did his troop array, 
 
 To Surrey's camp to ride ; 
 He had safe conduct for his band, 
 Beneath the royal seal and hand, 
 
 And Douglas gave a guide. 
 
 2. The train from out the castle drew, 
 But Marmion stopped to bid adieu : 
 "Though something I might plain," he said, 
 
 "Of cold respect to stranger guest, 
 Sent hither by the king's behest, 
 While in Tantallon's towers I staid, 
 Part we in friendship from your land, 
 And, noble Earl, receive my hand." 
 But Douglas round him drew his cloak, 
 Folded his arms, and thus he spoke : 
 
 "My manors, halls, and towers shall still 
 Be open, at my sovereign's will, 
 To each one whom he lists, howe'er 
 Unmeet to be the owner's peer. 
 My castles are my king's alone, 
 From turret to foundation stone ; 
 The hand of Douglas is his own ; 
 And never shall, in friendly grasp, 
 The hand of such as Marmion clasp." 
 
 3. Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire, 
 And shook his very frame for ire ; 
 
 And "This to me," he said, 
 "An 't were not for thy hoary beard, 
 Such hand as Marmion's had not spared 
 
 To cleave the Douglas' head ! 
 And, first I tell thee, haughty peer, 
 He, who does England's message here,

AND SPEAKER 117 
 
 Although the meanest in her state, 
 May well, proud Angus, be thy mate: 
 And, Douglas, more, I tell thee here, 
 
 E'en in thy pitch of pride, 
 Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near, 
 
 I tell thee, thou'rt defied! 
 And if thou said'st, I am not peer 
 To any lord in Scotland here 
 Lowland or Highland, far or near, 
 
 Lord Angus, thou — hast — lied !" 
 
 4. On the Earl's cheek, the flush of rage 
 O'ercame the ashen hue of age: 
 
 Fierce he broke forth ; "And dar'st thou then 
 To beard the lion in his den, 
 
 The Douglas in his hall? 
 And hopest thou thence unscathed to go ? 
 No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, No ! 
 Up draw-bridge, grooms, — what, warder, ho ! 
 
 Let the portcullis fall." 
 Lord Marmion turned, — well was his need, — 
 And dashed the rowels in his steed, 
 Like arrow through the archway sprung ; 
 The ponderous gate behind him rung. 
 To pass there was such scanty room, 
 The bars, descending, grazed his plume. 
 
 5. The steed along the draw-bridge flies, 
 Just as it trembled on the rise ; 
 
 Not lighter does the swallow skim 
 
 Along the smooth lake's level brim ; 
 
 And when Lord Marmion reached his band 
 
 He halts, and turns with clinched hand, 
 
 And shout of loud defiance pours, 
 
 And shook his gauntlet at the towers. 
 
 For additional practice in Explosive Orotund study the 
 seventh and tenth stanzas of "Revolutionary Rising" and the 
 fourth stanza of "An American Exile."

 plaintive quality. 
 
 The Plaintive, sometimes termed the semi-tone, or oral, 
 is that quality of voice whose tones, sliding through a semi- 
 tone or minor third, are uttered in a feeble, trembling tone, 
 with the resonance in the forward part of the mouth. 
 
 In the production of this quality the organs seem to labor 
 under a painful effort; and, though it sometimes expresses 
 the most exalted emotions, the weakness of the vocal organs 
 or intensity of emotional sympathy prevents the conversion 
 of all the breath used into tone, and the quality is therefore 
 impure. 
 
 directions for securing the plaintive quality. 
 
 Draw in the cheeks so as to reduce the size of the reso- 
 nance chamber of the mouth, gently compress the lips, and pro- 
 long the sound of long o, in high pitch, with subdued force. 
 This will give you the quality, when you can reproduce it in 
 the exercises following. 
 
 law of use. 
 
 The Plaintive Quality is used with various degrees of force 
 to express tenderness, sympathy, pathos, sadness, acute pain, 
 feebleness of old age, grief, entreaty, complaint, exhaustion, 
 languor and affectation. 
 
 Caution. — The student is cautioned against using this 
 quality in any case except where it may be proper. It should 
 be used with discretion even where indicated, as its excessive. 
 use is apt to run into a disagreeable whine, exciting ridicule 
 instead of pity.

 Begin with gentle, but earnest, pleading tones, and grad- 
 ually merge into a tremulous, agitated stress until the last

 utterance, but with sufficient distinctness to render the words 
 intelligible. This is an excellent piece for practice in the 
 plaintive tones. 
 
 i. Give me three grains of corn, mother, 
 
 Only three grains of corn ; 
 It will keep the little life I have, 
 
 Till the coming of the morn.

 Dying of hunger and cold, 
 And half the agony of such a death

 A wolf that is fierce for blood, — 
 All the livelong day, and the night beside, 
 
 Gnawing for lack of food. 
 I dreamed of bread in my sleep, mother, 
 
 And the sight was heaven to see ; 
 I awoke with an eager, famishing lip, 
 
 But you had no bread for me.

 3. How could I look to you, mother, 
 For bread to give to your starving boy,

 For I read the famine in your cheek, 
 
 And in your eye so wild, 
 And I felt it in your bony hand 
 
 As you laid it on your child. 
 
 4. Come nearer to my side, mother, 
 And hold me fondly as you held 
 
 My father when he died ; 
 Quick, for I cannot see you, mother, 
 
 My breath is almost gone ; 
 Mother ! dear mother ! ere I die, 
 
 Give me three grains of corn. 
 
 An excellent selection for additional practice in the prac- 
 tice of the Plaintive is 'The Dying Boy." 
 
 PECTORAL QUALITY. 
 
 The Pectoral is a rough, harsh, hollow tone, with the reso- 
 nance in the chest. 
 
 1. The Pectoral is low in pitch and usually slow in move- 
 ment. It arises from a debilitated or relaxed condition of the 
 vocal cords and a feeble action of the respiratory muscles. 
 
 2. It is exhibited in persons of little physical or mental 
 energy and in those addicted to dissipation and intemperance. 
 
 DIRECTIONS FOR PRODUCING THE PECTORAL. 
 
 Relax the muscles about the throat and waist. Give the 
 sound of long with low pitch, feeble voice and the utmost re- 
 laxation of all the vocal organs. Let the tone be hollow and 
 husky, somewhat resembling the grogan.

 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Pectoral quality is used to express dread, sorrow, 
 gloom, despair, grief, deep solemnity mingled with awe, re- 
 morse, horror, settled hatred, malice, and in the representation 
 of the supernatural. 
 
 The Pectoral is usually formed effusively, but the speaker 
 inflamed by the maligant passions frequently employs the ex- 
 pulsive mode of utterance. 
 
 David's Lament For Absalom. 
 
 n. p. willis. 
 
 The following poem furnishes a valuable drill for the 
 expression of deep feeling. Be careful to enter into the senti- 
 ment before attempting its portrayal. Avoid permitting the 
 tones to anticipate the feeling. You must experience the emo- 
 tion first — its expression is then possible. 
 
 I. Alas ! my noble boy, that thou shouldst die ! 
 
 Thou, who wert made to beautifully fair! 
 
 That death should settle in thy glorious eye, 
 
 And leave his stillness in this clustering hair ! 
 How could he mark thee for the silent tomb, 
 My proud boy, Absalom !

 2. Cold is thy brow, my son, and I am chill, 
 
 As to my bosom I have tried to press thee, 
 How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill, 
 
 Like a rich harp string, yearning to caress thee, 
 And hear thy sweet 'my father' from these dumb 
 And cold lips, Absalom ! 
 
 3. The grave hath won thee. I shall hear the gush 
 
 Of music, and the voices of the young, 
 And life will pass me in its mantling blush, 
 
 And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung, 
 But thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come 
 To meet me, Absalom ! 
 
 4. And, O ! when I am stricken, and my heart, 
 
 Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken, 
 How will its love for thee, as I depart, 
 
 Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token ! 
 It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom, 
 To see thee, Absalom ! 
 
 5. And now, farewell ! 'Tis hard to give thee up, 
 
 With death, so like a gentle slumber, on thee ; 
 And thy dark sin ! O ! I could drink the cup, 
 
 If from this woe its bitterness had won thee. 
 May God have called thee, like a wanderer home, 
 My erring Absalom ! 
 
 For other illustrations of Pectoral quality, see "Death Bed 
 of Benedict Arnold," "The Miser's Death" and the fifth and 
 seventh stanzas of "She Would be a Mason." 
 
 GUTTURAL QUALITY. 
 
 The Guttural (from guttur, throat) is a rough, harsh, 
 grating, rasping, discordant sound, produced by a rigid com- 
 pression of the muscles of the neck and a partial closing of the 
 throat above the glottis, with the resonance in the throat. The 
 quality resembles the growling utterances of the lower animals.

 i. The Guttural originates from an agitation of the most 
 intense and malignant passions. The sound is cut off from 
 communication with the chest by an obstructed throat, as in a 
 person suffering from intense rage. The sound issues appar- 
 ently from the pharynx, or swallow, instead of the larynx. 
 
 2. The Guttural quality, in a modified form, is very prev- 
 alent among persons with large, flaccid, vocal organs and in 
 the aged. Its use, except in the expression of the malignant 
 passions, should be carefully avoided. 
 
 3. The practice of this quality is highly beneficial in 
 strengthening the muscles of the throat. Its frequent employ- 
 ment by actors and vocal teachers protects from many forms 
 of throat disease. Boys and girls should practice the guttural 
 moderately at first, discontinuing as soon as any unpleasant 
 irritation is felt. 
 
 DIRECTIONS FOR PRODUCING THE GUTTURAL QUALITY. 
 
 Contract the muscles about the throat and neck and give 
 the sound of a in ah, in a harsh, grating tone, as if endeavor- 
 ing to clear the throat of an accumulation of phlegm.

 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Guttural quality, with various degrees of force, is used

 three modes of utterance, effusive, expulsive or explosive, ac- 
 cording to the sentiment indicated.

 Shylock' s Reply. 
 
 WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. 
 
 Antonio, a merchant of Venice, had given a bond to Shy- 
 lock, a wealthy Jew, for the payment of three thousand ducats, 
 which sum Shylock had loaned to Antonio's friend, Bassanio. 
 In default of payment it had been agreed that Shylock might 
 claim a pound of flesh to be taken nearest the merchant's heart. 
 Through a combination of circumstances Antonio fails to pay 
 the bond when due, and the Jew demands the forfeit. Salanio 
 endeavors to dissuade Shylock from exacting the penalty by 
 explaining that a pound of human flesh has no marketable 
 value, and ventures to ask to what use it can be put. Shylock, 
 almost consuming with rage, answers in the following terms. 
 
 This is one of the best exercises in the whole range of 
 elocutionary models for strengthening the vocal organs. Give 
 it daily attention for a month and mark the effect. 
 
 Use full force and long quantity with great intensity on 
 the italicized words. 
 
 Hatred, Contempt, Detestation. 
 
 Shylock: — To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, 
 it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered 
 me of half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked at my 
 gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my 
 friends, heated my enemies: and what's his reason? — I am a 
 Jezv. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, 
 dimensions, senses, affections, passions? — fed with the same 
 food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, 
 healed by the same means, zvarmed and cooled by the same 
 winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we 
 not bleed? — if you tickle us, do we not laugh? — if you poison 
 us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? 
 If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If 
 a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? revenge! If a 
 Christian wrong a Jezv, what should his sufferance be by

 Other fine illustrations of Guttural quality are "Vagaries 
 of a Madman," "Catiline's Defiance" and "The Seminole's 
 Defiance." 
 
 ASPIRATE QUALITY. 
 
 The Aspirate quality is articulated breath, and ranges from 
 a mere w T hisper to the least audible tones of the Plaintive, 
 Pectoral and Guttural qualities. 
 
 i. The true Aspirate is unmixed breath, but as the term 
 is commonly used, it is combined with other abnormal qualities 
 to aid their intensity of utterance. 
 
 2. The practice of the Aspirate quality alone and in com- 
 bination with other abnormal qualities, with full force, is highly 
 beneficial in strengthening the'vocal organs. 
 
 3. The daily practice of whispering a page or more of 
 vigorous prose or poetry with full force and sufficient dis- 
 tinctness to be heard across a large room will develop a greater 
 depth and penetration of tone than any one exercise in which 
 the student can engage. To secure the greatest benefit the 
 articulation must be as nearly perfect as the student can com- 
 mand. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Aspirate quality alone and in combination with other 
 qualities is used to express secrecy, surprise, impatience, fear, 
 caution, remorse, awe, dread, anger, rage, terror, horror and 
 expiring life.

 Macbeth's Vision. 
 
 william shakespeare. 
 
 Act II, Scene I. 
 
 Macbeth, a powerful lord of Scotland, with a drawn dag- 
 ger is stealthily approaching the chamber of king Duncan, his 
 guest for the night, to murder the king, when, seized with fear 
 and remorse, he imagines he sees a dagger suspended in the 
 air before him. 
 
 Begin with an excited whisper and gradually merge into a 
 strongly vocalized aspirate. 
 
 Few selections afford better practice in voice building 
 than the following. Open the mouth freely and exaggerate the 
 distinctness. 
 
 1. Is this a dagger which I see before me, 
 
 The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee : — 
 I have thee not; and yet I see thee still. 
 Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 
 
 To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but 
 
 A dagger of the mind; a false creation, 
 Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? 
 
 I see thee yet, in form as palpable 
 As this which now I draw. 
 
 2. Thou marshalYst me the way that I was going; 
 And such an instrument I was to use.

 Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still;

 3. Now o'er the one half world 
 
 Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse 
 The curtained sleep; now witchcraft celebrates 
 Pale Hecate's offerings; and withered murder, 
 Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf, 
 Whose howl's his watch, thus towards his design 
 Moves like a ghost. 
 
 4. Thou sure and firm-set earth, 
 
 Hear not my steps, which way they zealk, for fear 
 
 The very stones prate of my whereabout, 
 
 And take the present horror from the time. 
 
 Which now suits with it. — Whiles I threat, he lives; 
 
 Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 
 
 I go, and it is done ; the bell invites me. [A bell rings. 
 
 Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell 
 
 That summons thee to heaven, or to hell 
 
 XASAL QUALITY. 
 
 The Nasal quality (from nasus, the nose) is a harsh, thin, 
 twangy tone, with the resonance in the nose. 
 
 1. The Xasal is an impure quality, because its production 
 arises from some vocal disability, as a cold, or a mal- formation 
 of the organs of speech. 
 
 2. It is not a talking through the nose, as may be shown 
 by the reader's clasping his nose with his fingers and attempting 
 to read or speak in a pure tone. The quality which follows 
 is the Xasal. 
 
 3. The student will have no occasion to use the Nasal ex- 
 cept in mimcry or burlesque; but a perfect command of all 
 the qualities requires a drill upon this, both for the purpose of 
 personation and avoiding its use where improper.

 Place the organs in position to pronounce the syllable on 
 with high pitch; now depress the lower jaw and prolong the

 tion to be heard in the back part of the mouth and nose.

 1. About half-past eleven o'clock on Sunday night a 
 human leg, enveloped in blue broadcloth, might have been seen 
 entering Cephas Barberry's kitchen window. The leg was fol- 
 lowed finally by the entire person of a lively Yankee, attired 
 in his Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. It was, in short, Joe 
 Mayweed, who thus burglariously, in the dead of night, won 
 his way into the deacon's kitchen. 
 
 2. "Wonder how much the old deacon made by orderin'

 me not to darken his door again?" soliloquized the young man. 
 "Promised him 1 wouldn't, but didn't say nothin' about winders. 
 Winders is just as good as doors, if there ain't no nails to tear 
 your trousers onto. Wonder if Sal'll come down. The crit- 
 ter promised me. I'm afraid to move here, 'cause I might 
 break my shins over somethin' or 'nother, and wake the old 
 folks? Cold enough to freeze a polar bear here. Oh, here 
 comes Sally. " 
 
 3. The beautiful maiden descended with a pleasant smile, 
 a tallow' candle and a box of matches. 
 
 4. After receiving a rapturous greeting, she made a roar- 
 ing fire in the cooking stove, and the happy couple sat down to 
 enjoy the sweet interchange of views and hopes. But the 
 course of true love ran no smoother in old Barberry's kitchen 
 than it did elsewhere, and Joe, who was making up his mind 
 to treat himself to a kiss, was startled by the voice of the 
 deacon, her father, shouting from her chamber door : 
 
 5. "Sally, what are you getting up in the middle of the 
 night for ?" 
 
 "Tell him it's most mornin' " whispered Joe. 
 
 "I can't tell a fib," said Sally. 
 
 "I'll make it a truth, then," said Joe, and running to the 
 huge old-fashioned clock that stood in the corner, he set it at 
 five. 
 
 6. "Look at the clock and tell me what time it is," cried 
 the old gentleman up-stairs. 
 
 "It's five by the clock," answered Sally, and corroborating 
 the words the clock struck five. 
 
 The lovers sat down again, and resumed the conversation. 
 Suddenly the stair case began to creak. 
 
 "Good gracious ! it's father." 
 
 "The deacon, by jingo!" cried Joe; "hide me, Sal!" 
 
 "Where can I hide you ?" cried the distracted girl. 
 
 7. "Oh, I know," said he; "I'll squeeze into the clock 
 case." 
 
 And without another word he concealed himself in the 
 case, and drew to the door behind him. 
 
 The deacon was dressed, and seating himself down by the 
 cooking-stove pulled out his pipe, lighted it, and commenced 
 smoking" very deliberately and calmly.

 8. "Five o'clock, eh?" said he. "Well, I shall have time 
 to smoke three or four pipes ; then I'll go and feed the critters." 
 
 "Hadn't you better go and feed the critters first sir, and 
 smoke afterward?" suggested the dutiful Sally. 
 
 "No; smoking clears my head and wakes me up," answered 
 the deacon, who seemed not a whit disposed to hurry his en- 
 joyment. 
 
 9. Bur-r-r-r — whiz — z — ding — ding ! went the clock. 
 "Tormented lightning!" cried the deacon, starting up and 
 
 dropping his pipe on the stove. "What in creation is that?" 
 Whiz ! ding ! ding ! ding ! went the old clock furiously. 
 "It's only the clock striking five," said Sally tremulously. 
 
 10. "Powers of mercy !" cried the deacon, "striking five ! 
 It's struck a hundred already." 
 
 "Deacon Barberry !" cried the deacon's better half, who 
 had hastily robed herself, and now came plunging down the 
 stair case in the wildest state of alarm, "what is the matter of 
 the clock?" 
 
 "Goodness only knows," replied the old man. 
 
 "It's been in the family these hundred years, and never did 
 I know it to carry on so before." 
 
 Whiz ! bang ! bang ! bang ! went the clock. 
 
 11. "It'll burst itself!" cried the old lady, shedding a flood 
 of tears, "and there won't be nothing left of it." 
 
 "It's bewitched," said the deacon, who retained a leaven 
 of New England superstition in his nature. "Anyhow," he 
 said, after a pause, advancing resolutely toward the clock, "I'll 
 see what's got into it." 
 
 "Oh, don't !" cried the daughter, affectionately, seizing one 
 of his coat-tails, while his faithful wife hung to the other. 
 
 "Don't," chorused both the women together. 
 
 "Let go of my raiment!" shouted the deacon; "I ain't 
 afraid of the powers of darkness." 
 
 12. But the women would not let go ; so the deacon slipped 
 off his coat, and while, from the sudden cessation of resistance, 
 they fell heavily on the floor, he darted forward and laid his 
 hand on the door of the clock case. But no human power could 
 open it. Joe was holding it inside with a death-grasp. The 
 deacon began to be dreadfully frightened. He gave one more 
 tug. An unearthly yell, as of a fiend in distress, came from

 the inside, and then the clock case pitched headforemost on 
 the floor, smashed its face, and wrecked its proportions. 
 
 [3. The current of air extinguished the light; the deacon, 
 the old lady and Sally fled upstairs, and Joe Mayweed, extri- 
 cating himself from the clock, effected his retreat in the same 
 way that he had entered. The next day all Appleton was alive 
 with the story of how Deacon Barberry's clock had been be- 
 witched; and though many believed its version, some, and 
 especially ]oc Mayweed, affected to discredit the whole affair, 
 hinting that the deacon had been trying the experiment of tast- 
 ing frozen cider, and that the vagaries of the clock case existed 
 only in a distempered imagination. 
 
 FALSETTO QUALITY. 
 
 The Falsetto (from falsus, false) is a screechy, high, shrill 
 tone, pitched above the natural, with the resonance in the head. 
 The Falsetto begins where the pure tone breaks, or outruns its 
 compass. It is illustrated by the sharp, shrill shriek of the 
 owl. 
 
 1. In producing this quality of voice, the veil of the palate 
 is raised very high, and the uvula is forced into the veil, be- 
 coming completely hidden from view. 
 
 2. Some voices, through excitement or irritability, natur- 
 ally tend to run into the Falsetto. This is a serious fault and 
 should be carefully avoided. 
 
 DIRECTION FOR PRODUCING THE FALSETTO QUALITY. 
 
 Begin on the sound of long 0, with your natural pitch, and, 
 without changing the force, raise your pitch till the purity of 
 voice breaks, and the quality that follows will be Falsetto. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The Falsetto quality, like the Nasal, is used in mimicry, to 
 denote excitement, irritability, scolding, invective, mockery,

 sudden fright, anger, pain, terror, and irritable old age. It is 
 also employed in distant calling and in the imitation of faint 
 musical bells heard in the distance.

 And "she hadn't oughter a let him;

 The Country Justice. 
 
 Give narrative parts in Pure Tone. The Justice uses a 
 deep Orotund, his wife, the Falsetto. Let the three tones be 
 strongly marked, and the effect will be quite ludicrous. 
 
 1. "The snow is deep," the Justice said; 
 ''There's mighty mischief overhead, " 
 "High talk, indeed!" his wife exclaimed: 
 "What, sir ! shall Providence be blamed ?" 
 
 The Justice, laughing, said, "Oh, no ! 
 I only-meant the loads of snow 
 Upon the roofs. The barn is weak ; 
 I greatly fear the roof will break. 
 So hand me up the spade, my dear — 
 I'll mount the barn, the roof to clear." 
 
 2. "No!" said the wife; "the barn is high, 
 
 And if you slip, and fall, and die, 
 How will my living be secured ? — 
 Stephen, your life is not insured.

 All snugly tied and danger-proof! 
 Excelsior ! Excel — But no ! 
 The rope is not secured below !" 
 Said Rachel, "Climb, the end to throw 
 Across the top, and I will go 
 And tie that end around my waist." 
 
 3. "Well, every woman to her taste ; 
 
 You always would be tightly laced. 
 Rachel, when you became my bride, 
 I thought the knot securely tied ; 
 But lest the bond should break in twain, 
 I'll have it fastened once again." 
 
 4. Below the arm-pits tied around, 
 She takes her station on the ground, 
 While on the roof, beyond the ridge, 
 He shovels clear the lower edge. 
 But, sad mischance ! the loosened snow 
 Comes sliding down, to plunge below. 
 And as he tumbles with the slide, 
 Up Rachel goes on t'other side. 
 
 Just half way down the Justice hung; 
 
 Just half way up the woman swung. 
 "Good land o' Goshen!" shouted she; 
 "Why, do you see it ?" answered he. 
 
 5. The couple dangling in the breeze, 
 Like turkeys hung outside to freeze, 
 At their rope's end and wit's end, too, 
 Shout back and forth what best to do. 
 Cried Stephen, "Take it coolly, wife; 
 All have their ups and downs in life." 
 Quoth Rachel, "What a pity 'tis 
 
 To joke at such a time as this ! 
 
 A man whose wife is being hung 
 
 Should know enough to hold his tongue."

 6. "Now, Rachel, as I look below, 
 
 I see a tempting heap of snow. 
 Suppose, my dear, I take my knife, 
 And cut the rope to save my life?" 
 She shouted, "Don't ! 'twould be my death — - 
 I see some pointed stones beneath. 
 A better way would be to call, 
 With all our might for Phebe Hall." 
 "Agreed !" he roared. First he, then she 
 Gave tongue : "O Phebe ! Phebe ! Phe-e- 
 be Hall !" in tones both fine and coarse, 
 Enough to make a drover hoarse. 
 
 7. Now Phebe, over at the farm, 
 
 Was sitting, sewing, snug and warm ; 
 But hearing, as she thought, her name, 
 Sprang up, and to the rescue came, 
 Beheld the scene, and thus she thought : — 
 "If now a kitchen chair were brought, 
 And I could reach the lady's foot, 
 I'd draw her downward by the boot, 
 Then cut the rope, and let him go ; 
 He cannot miss the pile of snow." 
 
 8. He sees her moving toward his wife, 
 Armed with a chair and carving knife, 
 And, ere he is aware, perceives 
 
 His head ascending to the eaves, 
 And, guessing what the two are at. 
 Screams from beneath the roof, "Stop that! 
 You make me fall too far, by half !" 
 But Phebe answers with a laugh, 
 "Please tell a body by what right 
 You've brought your wife to such a plight?" 
 And then, with well-directed blows, 
 She cuts the rope and down he goes. 
 
 9. The wife untied, they walked around, 
 When lo ! no Stephen can be found, 
 liiey call in vain, run to and fro; 
 They look around, above, below,

 No trace or token can they >ee, 
 And deeper grows the mystery. 
 
 Then Rachel's heart within her sank; 
 But, glancing at the snowy bank, 
 She caught a little gleam of hope — 
 A gentle movement of the rope. 
 
 10. They scrape away a little snow ; — 
 
 What's this ? A hat ! Ah ! he's below. 
 Then upward heaves the snowy pile, 
 And forth he stalks in tragic style, 
 Unhurt, and with a roguish smile ; 
 And Rachel sees, with glad surprise, 
 The missing found, the fallen rise. 
 
 FORCE. 
 
 Force is the degree of energy, depending upon the in- 
 tensity of feeling, with which speech is delivered. 
 
 i. Force should not be confounded with loudness. Force 
 is the measure of intensity by which a sentiment or emotion, 
 concentrated in the speaker's mind, is manifested by utter- 
 ance. Force marks the degree of mental and physical agita- 
 tion rather than its expression. Loudness depends upon force 
 and pitch — full force and high pitch producing the greatest 
 degree of loudness. Words may be uttered with full force in 
 a whisper. 
 
 2. The degree of force employed in the expression of the 
 various sentiments and emotions corresponds, with one excep- 
 tion, to the strength of the sentiments or emotions that occa- 
 sion speech. Sometimes we are so overpowered by passion, 
 fright, or other overwhelming emotion, that the energy re- 
 quired to express our feelings is consumed in maintaining our 
 very consciousness. 
 
 3. Few subjects treated by the elocutionist are of greater 
 


## p. 136 (#142) ############################################

136 brown's standard elocution 
 
 importance in developing a full, deep, flexible, and powerful 
 voice than that of force; hence, practice — much practice, and 
 intelligent practice is essential in this department of vocal 
 culture. 
 
 4. The student should increase his force by degrees. 
 Sudden transitions are injurious to one not accustomed to a 
 severe use of the voice. Every new acquisition of power will 
 enable him to go beyond his present attainments. When that 
 degree of force is obtained beyond which the voice cannot go 
 without inconvenience, the effort to increase the force should 
 be discontinued, and a few minutes' practice should be had 
 with that degree of force. 
 
 5. In the exercises following, avoid any change of pitch 
 while increasing the force. If the pitch is raised, begin again 
 with the element and endeavor to complete the fullest degree 
 of force with the same pitch with which that element is begun. 
 
 6. The student will observe that every shade of emotion 
 requires a corresponding degree of force. The varying in- 
 tensity must therefore be constantly noted and faithfully in- 
 dicated by the appropriate force. 
 
 DIVISION OF FORCE. 
 
 Force may be divided into three classes, namely : Subdued, 
 Moderate, Full, each of which may be further divided into 
 three degrees. 
 
 exercises. 
 
 The student will repeat the sentence opposite the dots with 
 nine degrees of force without change of pitch. Begin with 
 the least audible sound that can be uttered, and increase in 
 intensity not loudness, till the utmost energy is attained. Re- 
 verse the order. Repeat each degree of force several times 
 before passing to the next.

 Avoid affectation. 
 
 i. Tis beauteous night; the stars look brightly down 
 Upon the earth, decked in her robe of snow. 
 No light gleams at the windows, save my own, 
 Which gives its cheer to midnight and to me. 
 And now, with noiseless step, sweet memory comes 
 And leads me gently through her twilight realms. 
 What poet's tuneful lyre has ever sung, 
 Or delicatest pencil e'er portrayed 
 The enchanted, shadowy land where memory dwells ?

 Dark-shaded by the mournful cypress tree ; 
 And yet its sunlit mountain tops are bathed 
 
 In Heaven's own blue. Upon its craggy cliffs, 
 Robed in the dreamy light of distant years, 
 Are clustered joys serene of other days. 
 
 3. Upon its gently sloping hill-sides bend 
 The weeping willows of the sacred dust 
 Of dear departed ones; yet in that land, 
 Where'er our footsteps fall upon the shore, 
 They that were sleeping rise from out the dust 
 Of death's long, silent years, and round us stand 
 As erst they did before the prison tomb 
 Received their clay within its voiceless halls. 
 
 4. The path of youth winds down through many a vale, 
 And on the brink of many a dread abyss, 
 
 From out whose darkness comes no ray of light, 
 Save that a phantom dances o'er the gulf 
 And beckons toward the verge. Again, the path 
 Leads o'er the summit where the sunbeams fall ; 
 And thus in light and shade, shunshine and gloom, 
 Sorrow and joy, this life-path leads along.

 MODERATE FORCE. LAW OF USE. 
 
 Moderate Force is employed in the expression of narrative 
 descriptive and didactic thought, and may be used to express 
 the milder forms of sublimity, solemnity, grandeur and devo- 
 tion, and in introductions to orations. 
 
 The Gladiator. 
 Moderate Force. 
 
 This is an excellent piece for recitation. The force through- 
 out, except the gladiator's speech, is moderate. His words 
 receive more force than the narrative part. Let the whole be 
 rendered with animation and the effect will be impressive and 
 thrilling. 
 
 i. Stillness reigned in the vast amphitheatre, and, from 
 the countless thousands that thronged the spacious inclosure, 
 not a breath was heard. Every tongue was mute with suspense, 
 and every eye strained with anxiety toward the gloomy portal 
 where the gladiator was momentarily expected to enter. At 
 length the trumpet sounded, and they led him forth into the 
 broad arena. There w r as no mark of fear upon his manly coun- 
 tenance, as with majestic step and fearless eye he entered. He 
 stood there, like another Apollo, firm and unbending as the 
 rigid oak. His fine proportioned form was matchless, and 
 his turgid muscles spoke his giant strength. 
 
 2. "I am here," he cried, as his proud lip curled in scorn, 
 "to glut the savage eyes of Rome's proud populace. Aye, like 
 a dog you throw me to a beast ; and what is my offense ? Why, 
 forsooth, I am a Christian. But know, ye can not fright my 
 soul, for it is based upon a foundation stronger than the 
 adamantine rock. Know ye, whose hearts are harder than the 
 flinty stone, my heart quakes not with fear ; and here I aver, I 
 would not change conditions with the blood-stained Nero, 
 crowned though he be, not for the wealth of Rome. Blow ye 
 your trumpet — I am ready."

 3. The trumpet sounded, and a long, low growl was heard 
 to proceed from the cage of a half-famished Numidian lion 
 situated at the farthest end of the arena. The growl deepened 
 into a roar of tremendous volume, which shook the enormous 
 edifice to its very center. At that moment the door was thrown 
 open, and the huge monster of the forest sprang from his den, 
 with one mighty bound to the opposite side of the arena. His 
 eyes blazed with the brilliancy of fire, as he slowly drew his 
 length along the sand, and prepared to make a spring upon 
 his formidable antagonist. The gladiator's eye quailed not; 
 his lip paled not ; but he stood immovable as a statue, waiting 
 the approach of his wary foe. 
 
 4. At length, the lion crouched himself into an attitude for 
 springing, and with the quickness of lightning, leaped full at 
 the throat of the gladiator. But he was prepared for him, and 
 bounding lightly on one side, his falchion flashed for a moment 
 over his head, and in the next it was deeply dyed in the purple 
 blood of the monster. A roar of redoubled fury again re- 
 sounded through the spacious amphitheatre, as the enraged 
 animal, mad with anguish from the wound he had just re- 
 ceived, wheeled hastily round, and sprang a second time at the 
 Nazarene. 
 
 5. Again was the falchion of the cool and intrepid gladiator 
 deeply planted in the breast of his terrible adversary; but so 
 sudden had been the second attack, that it was impossible to 
 avoid the full impetus of his bound, and he staggered and 
 fell upon his knee. The monster's paw was upon his shoulder, 
 and he felt his hot fiery breath upon his cheek, as it rushed 
 through his wide distended nostrils. The Nazarene drew a 
 short dagger from his girdle, and endeavored to regain his 
 feet. But his foe, aware of his design, precipitating himself 
 upon him, threw him with violence to the ground. 
 
 6. The excitement of the populace was now wrought up 
 to a high pitch, and they waited the result with breathless sus- 
 pense. A low growl of satisfaction now announced the noble 
 animal's triumph, as he sprang fiercely upon his prostrate 
 enemy. But it was of short duration ; the dagger of .the 
 gladiator pierced his vitals, and together they rolled over and 
 over, across the broad arena. Again the dagger drank deep 
 of the monster's blood, and again a roar of anguish reverberated 
 through the stately edifice.

 7. The Nazarene, now watching his opportunity, sprang 
 with the velocity of thought from the terrific embrace of his 
 enfeebled antagonist, and regaining his falchion, which had 
 fallen to the ground in the struggle, he buried it deep in the 
 heart of the infuriated beast. The noble king of the forest, 
 faint from the loss of blood, concentrated all his remaining 
 strength in one mighty bound ; but it was too late ; the last 
 blow had been driven home to the center of life, and his huge 
 form fell with a mighty crash upon the arena, amid the thunder- 
 ing acclamations of the populace. 
 
 FULL FORCE. LAW OF USE. 
 
 Full Force is employed in the expression of strong emo- 
 tion, as joy, gladness, courage, boldness, defiance, anger, pro- 
 found sublimity and grandeur, and in the delivery of political, 
 senatorial, and judicial speeches of an exalted oratorical char- 
 acter.

 Fall on a slave; not such as, swept along 
 By the full tide of power, the conqueror led 
 To crimson glory and undying fame : 
 But — base — ignoble slaves ; slaves to a horde 
 Of petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords, 
 Rich in some dozen paltry villages; 
 Strong in some hundred spearmen; only great 
 In that strange spell — a name.

 To the beloved disciple. 
 
 4. How I loved 
 That gracious boy ! Younger by fifteen years, 
 Brother at once, and son ! He left my side, 
 
 A summer bloom on his fair cheek ; a smile 
 
 Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour 
 
 The pretty harmless boy was slain ! I saw 
 
 The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried 
 
 For vengeance \ Rouse ye, Romans ! Rouse ye Slaves ! 
 
 Have ye brave sons? Look in the next fierce brawl ! 
 
 To see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look 
 
 To see them live, torn from your arms, distained,

 Be answered by the lash. 
 
 5. Yet, this is Rome, 
 That sat on her seven hills, and from her throne 
 Of beauty, ruled the world ! Yet, we are Romans.

 Hear me, ye walls that echoed to the tread 
 Of either Brutus ! — once again, I swear,

 SUSTAINED FORCE. 
 
 In addressing large assemblies, and in calling and com- 
 manding, the Full Force is sustained for some moments, ac- 
 cording to the size of the audience, or distance to which the 
 voice is to be heard. 
 
 Calling at a distance and preparatory commands require an 
 effusive prolongation on the accented vowels. Speaking to 
 great numbers at a distance requires long quantity on words 
 and long pauses between the words.

 Its delivery requires effusive and expulsive orotund, full 
 and sustained force, long quantity and long pauses. 
 
 i. Fellow-citizens: It is no ordinary cause that has 
 brought together this vast assemblage, on the present occasion. 
 We have met, not to prepare ourselves for political contests. 
 We have met, not to celebrate the achievements for those gal- 
 lant men who have planted our victorious standards in the 
 heart of an enemy's country. We have assembled not to re- 
 spond to shouts of triumph from the West, but to answer the 
 cry of want and suffering which comes from the East. The 
 Old World stretches out her arms to the New. The starving 
 parent supplicates the young and vigorous child for bread. 
 
 2. There lies upon the other side of the wide Atlantic a 
 beautiful island, famous in story and in song. Its area is not 
 so great as that of the state of Louisiana, while its population 
 is almost half that of the Union. It has given to the world 
 more than its share of genius and of greatness. It has been 
 prolific in statesmen, warriors, and poets. Its brave and gen- 
 erous sons have fought successfully all battles but their own. 
 In wit and humor it has no equal ; while its harp, like its his- 
 tory, moves to tears by its sweet but melancholy pathos. 
 
 3. Into this fair region, God has seen fit to send the most 
 terrible of all those fearful ministers that fulfill his inscrutable 
 decrees. The Earth has failed to give her increase. The com- 
 mon mother has forgotten her offspring, and she no longer 
 affords them their accustomed nourishment. Famine, gaunt 
 and ghastly Famine, has seized a nation with its strangling 
 grasp. Unhappy Ireland, in the sad woes of the present, for- 
 gets, for a moment, the gloomy history of the past. 
 
 4. Oh ! it is terrible, that in this beautiful world, which the 
 good God has given us, and in which there is plenty for us all, 
 men should die of starvation 5 When a man dies of disease, he 
 alone endures the pain. Around his pillow are gathered sym- 
 pathizing friends, who, if they can not keep back the deadly 
 messenger, cover his face, and conceal the horrors of his visage, 
 as he delivers his stern mandate. In battle, in the fullness of 
 his pride and strength, little recks the soldier whether the hiss- 
 ing bullet sings his sudden requiem, or the cords of life are 
 severed by the sharp steel. 
 
 5. But he who dies of hunger, wrestles alone, day after

 day, with his grim and unrelenting enemy. He has no friends 
 to cheer him in the terrible conflict; for, if he had friends, how 
 could he die of hunger? lie has not the hot blood of the sol- 
 dier to maintain him; for hi Foe, vampire-like, has exhausted 
 his veins. Famine comes not up, like a brave enemy, storming, 
 by a sudden onset, the fortress that resi>ts. Famine besieges, 
 lie draws his lines round the doomed garrison. He cuts off all 
 supplies. He never summons to surrender; for he gives no 
 quarter. 
 
 6. Alas ! for poor human nature, how can it sustain this 
 fearful warfare? Day by day the blood recedes; the flesh 
 deserts ; the muscles relax, and the sinews grow pow r erless. At 
 last the mind, which at first had bravely nerved itself against 
 the contest, gives way, under the mysterious influences which 
 govern its union with the body. Then the victim begins to 
 doubt the existence of an overruling Providence. He hates his 
 fellow-men, and glares upon them with the longing of a can- 
 nibal ; and, it may be, dies blaspheming. 
 
 7. This is one of those cases in which we may, without im- 
 piety, assume, as it were, the function of Providence. Who 
 knows but that one of the very objects of this calamity is to 
 test the benevolence and worthiness of us, upon whom un- 
 limited abundance is showered? In the name, then, of com- 
 mon humanity, I invoke your aid in behalf of starving Ireland. 
 He who is able, and will not aid such a cause, is not a man, 
 and has no right to wear the form. He should be sent back 
 to Nature's mint, and re-issued as a counterfeit on humanity, 
 of Nature's baser metal. 
 
 For other examples of sustained force, see the commands 
 
 in "'Charge of the Light Brigade." 
 
 STRESS. 
 
 Stress is the application of Force to some particular part, 
 of a syllable or word. 
 
 1. Stress differs from accent in this particular: stress is 
 limited to only a part of a syllable, while accent includes the 
 entire svllable.

 2. In the utterance of an elementary sound which consists 
 of but a single impulse of the voice, the force may lie promi- 
 nently on the first or on the last part, on the middle or on both 
 extremes, or it may be distributed with an equal degree 
 throughout the sound. 
 
 The divisions of stress are, 
 
 Radical, Median, Final, 
 
 Compound, Thorough, Intermittent. 
 
 radical stress. 
 
 Radical Stress (| HH^^^O ls tlie application of Force 
 to the first part of a syllable or word. 
 
 In applying this stress the sound should burst instanta- 
 neously upon the first part of the syllable or word, and the 
 succeeding part should be uttered with a decreasing force. 
 
 LAW OF USE. 
 
 The degree of Radical Stress is determined by the intensity 
 of emotion. It is used, first, in a mild form, to express nar- 
 rative, didactic, and descriptive thought; and, second, with 
 greater force, to express mirthful emotions, sudden anger, fear, 
 impetuous and startling emotions; and, third, with full force, 
 in the delivery of vigorous and earnest argument.

 i. Out of the Xorth the wild news came, 
 Far flashing on its wings of flame, 
 Swift as the boreal light which flies 
 At midnight through the startled skies. 
 And there was tumult in the air, 
 
 The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat, 
 And through the wide land everywhere 
 
 The answering tread of hurrying feet, 
 While the first oath of freedom's gun 
 Came on the blast from Lexington ; 
 And Concord roused, no longer tame, 
 Forgot her old baptismal name, 
 Made bare her patriot arm of power, 
 And swelled the discord of the hour.

 4. The pastor came; his snowy locks 
 
 Hallowed his brow of thought and care; 
 And calmly, as shepherdes lead their flocks, 
 
 He lead into the house of prayer. 
 Then soon he rose ; the prayer was strong ; 
 The Psalm was warrior David's song; 
 The text, a few short words of might — 
 "The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!" 
 He spoke of wrongs too long endured, 
 Of sacred rights to be secured; 
 Then from his patriot tongue of flame 
 The startling words for Freedom came. 
 
 5. The stirring sentences he spake 
 Compelled the heart to glow or quake, 
 And rising on his theme's broad wing,

 In face of death he dared to fling 
 Defiance to a tyrant king. 
 
 6. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed 
 In eloquence of attitude, 
 
 Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher; 
 Then swept his kindling glance of fire 
 From startled pew to breathless choir; 
 When suddenly his mantle wide 
 His hands impatient flung aside, 
 And, lo ! he met their wondering eyes 
 Complete in all a warrior's guise.

150 brown's standard elocution 
 
 consists in a gradual swelling of voice to the middle of the 
 syllable or word, followed by a gradually diminishing force to 
 the end. 
 
 1. The Median Stress supplies the chief element of 
 grandeur, beauty and impressiveness in the rendition of poetic 
 thought. 
 
 2. The lengthened and expansive quantity given to those 
 words significant of pathos, sublimity, and intense feeling reach 
 the heart and enlist our sympathies beyond the power of the 
 most artistic combination of words. It is the natural vein with 
 which heart speaks to heart. 
 
 3. Great care, however, should be exercised lest this 
 should be overdone, misplaced or ill-timed, for ridicule and 
 contempt would then take the place of sympathy. To avoid 
 any misapplication, feel the sentiment before you attempt its 
 expression. Here, as elsewhere, artistic error deceives only 
 artificial tastes. 
 
 4. The characteristic utterance of Median Stress is effu- 
 sive, though the expression of the more elevated emotions of 
 grandeur and sublimity coupled with full force requires an 
 expulsive utterance. 
 
 EXERCISES IN MEDIAN STRESS. 
 
 1. O, the long and dreary winter!

 3. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!

 votion.

 The Final Stress ( -*oK£8H I ) * 5 ^e application of 
 force to the last part of the syllable or word. 
 
 1. The final Stress consists of a gradual increase of force 
 till the end of the syllable or word is reached, when the force 
 culminates in an abrupt explosive utterance. 
 
 2. This is emphatically the stress of decisive statements. 
 Its use, with those to whom it is natural, admits of no equivo- 
 cation. 
 
 3. The student is cautioned against its use where not in- 
 dicated. Its frequent recurrence in conversation or oratory, 
 when not required in appropriate expression, savors of arro- 
 gance, and serves to repel rather than to persuade or convince.

 the fight. "He has it!" cried the People: "habet! habet!" 
 But still he lowered not his arm, until, at length, I held him, 
 gashed and fainting, in my power. 
 
 3. I looked around upon the Podium, where sat your Sen- 
 ators and men of State, to catch the signal of release, of mercy. 
 But not a thumb was reversed. To crown your sport the van- 
 quished man must die ! Obedient brute that I was, I was about 
 to slay him, when a few hurried words — rather a welcome to 
 death than a plea for life — told me he was a Thracian. I stood 
 transfixed. The arena vanished. I was in Thrace, upon my 
 native hills ! The sword dropped from my hands. I raised the 
 dying youth tenderly in my arms. O, the magnanimity of 
 Rome. 
 
 4. Your haughty leaders, enraged at being cheated of their 
 deathshow, hissed their disappointment, and shouted." Kill !" 
 I heeded them as I would heed the howl of wolves. Kill him? 
 — They might better have asked the mother to kill the babe, 
 smiling in her face. Ah ! he was already wounded unto death ; 
 and, amid the angry yells of the spectators, he died. That 
 night I was scourged for disobedience. I shall not forget it. 
 Should memory fail, there are scars here to quicken it. 
 
 5. Well; do not grow impatient. Some hours after, find- 
 ing myself with seventy fellow gladiators, alone in the amphi- 
 theatre, the laboring thought broke forth in words. I said — I 
 know not what. I only know that when I ceased, my comrades 
 looked each other in the face — and then burst forth the simul- 
 taneous cry — "Lead on! lead on, O Spartacus!" Forth we 
 rushed — seized what rude weapons Chance threw in our way, 
 and to the mountains speeded. There day by day our little band 
 increased. 
 
 6. Disdainful Rome sent after us a handful of her troops, 
 with a scourge for the slave Spartacus. Their weapons soon 
 were ours. She sent an army ; and down from old Vesuvius 
 we poured, and slew three thousand. Now it was Spartacus 
 the dreaded rebel! A larger army, headed by the Praetor, was 
 sent and routed ; then another still. And always I remembered 
 that fierce cry, riving my heart, and calling me to "kill!" In 
 three pitched battles, have I not obeyed it? And now affrighted

 rent, terrible and strong, it sweeps to the abyss where all is 
 ruin. So Spartacus comes on! So swells his force — small and 
 despised at first, but now 7 resistless ! On, on to Rome we come ! 
 The gladiators come ! Let Opulence tremble in all his palaces ! 
 Let Oppression shudder to think the oppressed may have their

 PITCH. 
 
 Pitch is the degree of elevation or depression of sound 
 above or below the keynote. 
 
 1. We say that one tone is higher than another when the 
 number of vibrations produced in the utterance of one is 
 greater than the other. 
 
 2. Pitch in music is determined by the unvarying musical 
 scale, and transitions from high to low, or the reverse, are 
 made by steps ; while in speech the appropriate pitch depends 
 


## p. 163 (#169) ############################################

AXD SPEAKER 163 
 
 upon the sentiment to he expressed and the construction of 
 the vocal organs of the speaker; and the various changes are 
 made by slides of the voice called the concrete movement. 
 
 3. A number of persons singing the same piece of music 
 would employ the same pitch, but if these same persons read 
 the same selection, though it require a high or low pitch, there 
 is scarcely any probability that their voices would be pitched 
 upon the same key; and yet, each, using his appropriate pitch 
 for the sentiment, would read it correctly. In the first in- 
 stance the pitch is determined by musical instruments ; in the 
 latter, by the voices of the respective individuals. 
 
 4. All that has been said concerning the influence of emo- 
 tion in determining the appropriate element in vocal expres- 
 sion applies to pitch. These conditions operate directly upon 
 the vocal organs — tension of the vocal chords, producing a 
 high pitch, arises from exaltation of spirit; relaxation of these 
 chords, producing low pitch, accompanies mental depression ; 
 while a tranquil state of mind leaves the vocal chords in their 
 natural condition, and a pitch midway between high and low 
 will be selected. 
 
 DIVISIONS OF PITCH. 
 
 Since the sentiment determines the appropriate pitch, three 
 divisions are naturally formed, which we designate high, mid- 
 dle and low. 
 
 1. These divisions are not absolute, and have no definite 
 place on the musical scale. They vary according to intensity 
 of feeling and the natural key of different voices. 
 
 2. Each of these divisions has an extended compass, since 
 many emotions that are classed as exciting differ widely in 
 degree and in their influence upon individuals ; hence, we may 
 have pitch high, moderately high, and very high, and the same 
 is true of low pitch. The pupil must decide from the intensity 
 


## p. 164 (#170) ############################################

164 brown's standard elocution 
 
 of the sentiment what degree of high or low pitch he shall use, 
 bearing in mind that the greater the agitation from joyous or 
 angry emotions, the higher the pitch; and, conversely, the 
 greater the depression from emotions of solemnity or grief, 
 the lower the pitch. 
 
 EXERCISES. 
 
 Pronounce each name in the following list with pure tone, 
 moderate force, radical stress, as you would if calling to the 
 individuals situated at distances indicated by the number of 
 feet opposite his name. Repeat the names in reverse order, 
 and afterward promiscuously, always imagining the distance 
 to which your voice is to be heard : 
 
 Very low pitch 5 feet — Thomas Hall. 
 
 Low pitch 10 feet — Henry Jones. 
 
 Moderately low pitch 20 feet — Samuel Taylor. 
 
 Middle pitch 40 feet — David Cole. 
 
 Moderately high pitch 80 feet — James Temple. 
 
 High pitch 160 feet — Robert Morris. 
 
 Very high pitch 320 feet — Edward Blake. 
 
 Begin with one and count to ten, starting with your lowest 
 pitch, and ending with your highest. Reverse the order. 
 Maintain a moderate force. Avoid the musical scale. 
 
 MIDDLE PITCH. 
 
 The Middle Pitch is used in our ordinary conversation in 
 the delivery of narrative, descriptive and didactic thought, and 
 in the introduction to lectures, orations and sermons.

 The Music of the Human Voice. 
 
 WILLIAM RUSSELL. 
 
 Read in a clear, full, pure, earnest tone. Use Moderate 
 Force, Radical Stress, with Middle Pitch. Avoid anything 
 strained or artificial. 
 
 i. Willis, in his essay on "Unwritten Music," has placed 
 the appropriate sound of the female voice among the most 
 beautiful of its forms ; and there is, unquestionably, a fine 
 analogy between the sound of the running brook, the note of 
 the wood-bird, the voice of a happy child, the low breathing of 
 a flute, and the clear, soft tone of a woman's voice, when it 
 utters the natural music of home — the accents of gentleness 
 and love. 
 
 2. To a well-tuned ear, there is a rich, deep melody in the 
 distinctive bass of the male voice, in its subdued tones. But 
 the keynote of poetry seems to have been lent to woman. On 
 the ear of infancy and childhood, her voice was meant to fall 
 as a winning prelude to all the other melodies of nature; the 
 human nerves are attuned, accordingly, to the breath of her 
 voice; and, through life, the chords of the heart respond most 
 readily to her touch. 
 
 3. Yet how often is this result impeded by the processes 
 of artificial culture; by the over-excitement of mind and nerve, 
 attending excessive application ; by that unwise neglect of 
 health and healthful action, which dims the eye and deadens 
 the ear to beauty, and robs life of the joyous and sympathetic 
 spirit which is native to childhood ; and which, otherwise, would 
 ever be gushing forth in notes of gladness and endearment, 
 the physicial not less than the moral charm of human utterance. 
 
 4. There are beautiful exceptions, undoubtedly, to this 
 general fact of ungainly habit. But the ground of just com- 
 plaint is, that there is no provision made in our systems of 
 education for the cultivation of one of woman's peculiar en- 
 dowments — an attractive voice. Our girls do not come home 
 to us, after their period of school life, qualified to read with 
 effect in their own language. There is wanting in their voices 
 that adaptation of tone to feeling, which is the music of the 
 heart in reading; there is wanting that clear, impressive style

 which belongs to the utterance of cultivated taste and judg-

 2. For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, 
 I am willing to know the whole truth — to know the worst, and 
 to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are 
 guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no 
 way of judging of the future but by the past; and, judging by 
 the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct 
 of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those 
 hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace them- 
 selves and the House. 
 
 3. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has 
 been lately received? .Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to 
 your feet! Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. 
 Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition 
 comports w T ith those warlike preparations which cover our 
 waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary 
 to a work of love and reconcilation ? Have we shown our- 
 selves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called 
 in to win back our love ? 
 
 4. Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the imple- 
 ments of zi'ar and subjugation — the last arguments to which 
 kings resort. I ask, sir, what means this martial array, if its 
 purpose be not to force us to submission ? Can gentlemen as- 
 sign any other possible motive for it ? Has Great Britain any 
 enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumula- 
 tion of navies and armies ? 
 
 5. No, sir, she has none; they are meant for us; they can 
 be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet 
 upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so 
 long forging. And what have we to oppose to them ? 
 
 6. Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that 
 for the last — ten — years. Have we anything new to offer upon 
 the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every 
 light of which it is capable, but it has been all in vain. Shall 
 we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms 
 shall we find which have not been already exhausted? 
 
 7. Let us not, I beseech you, sir deceive ourselves longer. 
 Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the 
 storm that is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have

 remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have PROSTRATED 
 ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition 
 to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. 
 
 8. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances 
 have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications 
 have been disregarded; and we have been spurned with con- 
 tempt from the foot of the throne ! In vain, after these things, 
 may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. 
 There is no longer any room for hope. 
 
 9. If we wish to be free; if we mean to preserve inviolate 
 those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long 
 contending; if we mean not basely to abandon the noble strug- 
 gle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we 
 have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious ob- 
 ject of our contest shall be obtained, we must fight! I repeat 
 it, sir: We must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God 
 of Hosts is all that is left us ! 
 
 10. They tell us, sir, that we are weak — unable to cope 
 with so formidable an adversary; but when shall we be 
 stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will 
 it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard 
 shall be stationed in every house ? Shall we gather strength by 
 irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of ef- 
 fectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging 
 the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have 
 bound us hand and foot? 
 
 11. Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those 
 means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. 
 Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, 
 and in such a country as that which zve posses, are invincible 
 by any force which our enemy can send against us. 
 
 12. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone; there

 who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The

 me liberty, or Give Me Death !

 i. Oh ! a wonderful stream is the river Time, 
 
 As it runs through the realm of tears, 
 With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme 
 And a broader sweep and a surge sublime, 
 
 As it blends in the ocean of years ! 
 
 2. How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow, 
 
 And the summers like birds between, 
 And the years in the sheaf, how they come and they go 
 On the river's breast with its ebb and flow, 
 
 As it glides in the shadow and sheen ! 
 
 3. There's a Magical Isle up the river Time, 
 
 Where the softest of airs are playing. 
 There's a cloudless sky and tropical clime, 
 And a song as sweet as a vesper chime, 
 
 And the Junes with the roses are straying. 
 
 4. And the name of this Isle is "the Long Ago," 
 
 And we bury our treasures there ; 
 There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow, 
 There are heaps of dust — oh ! we love them so — 
 
 And there are trinkets and tresses of hair. 
 
 5. There are fragments of songs that nobody sings, 
 
 There are parts of an infant's prayer, 
 There's a lute unswept and a harp without strings, 
 There are broken vows and pieces of rings, 
 
 And the garments our dead used to wear. 
 
 6. There are hands that are waved when the fairy shore 
 
 By the mirage is lifted in air, 
 And we sometimes hear through the turbulent roar 
 Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before, 
 
 When the wind down the river was fair. 
 
 7. Oh ! remembered for aye be that blessed Isle, 
 
 All the day of life until night; 
 And when evening glows with its beautiful smile, 
 And our eyes are closing in slumbers aw T hile, 
 
 May the greenwood of soul be in sight.

 Movement. 
 
 Movement is the degree of rapidity or slowness with 
 which words are uttered in continuous discourse. 
 
 i. Movement, like other elements of vocal expression, de- 
 pends upon the nature of the thought to be spoken; and as 
 the moods of mind, like an April sky, are constantly chang- 
 ing, — now buoyant with hope or exhilarated with joy, and 
 anon sobered in serious contemplation or depressed by grief, 
 there is necessarily little uniformity in the rate of human 
 speech. 
 
 2. The slow and measured tread, timed in unison with the 
 mournful dirge, suggests gloom and sorrow; while the lively 
 step of the merry dancers in fling or reel, betray the utmost 
 animation of mind and body. "The grave psalm and the song 
 of serious sentiment express, in their measured regularity, the 
 adaptation of gentle and moderate movement to tranquil and 
 sedate feeling." 
 
 3. A perfect command of every degree of movement is 
 essential to correct and effective reading or speaking. Igno- 
 rance of this element gives the reading and declamation of our 
 pupils that monotonous drawl which renders exercises so in- 
 sipid and tedious to visitors. 
 
 4. Appropriate movement is indispensable in rousing and 
 retaining the attention of an audience ; hence, no pains should 
 be spared to adapt the movement of every selection to the 
 sentiment intended to be conveyed. 
 
 CLASSES OF MOVEMENT. 
 
 The natural divisions of Movements are, Rapid, Moderate 
 


## p. 172 (#178) ############################################

172 brown's standard elocution 
 
 and Slow, with the further subdivisions of very rapid and 
 very slow. 
 
 MODERATE MOVEMENT. 
 
 Moderate Movement is used in unimpassioned discourse, 
 in the expression of narrative, descriptive and didactic thought, 
 and in the beginning of orations. 
 
 The term "Moderate" must not be understood as repre- 
 senting a uniform rate. It includes a rate of movement that 
 is constantly varying with the sentiment between rapid and 
 slow. 
 
 TACT AND TALENT. 
 
 Moderate Movement. 
 
 1. Talent is something, but tact is everything. Talent is 
 serious, sober, grave, and respectable; tact is all that, and 
 more too. It is not a sixth sense, but it is the life of all the 
 five. It is the open eye, the quick ear, the judging taste, the 
 keen smell, and the lively touch ; it is the interpreter of all 
 riddles, the surmounter of all difficulties, the remover of all 
 obstacles. It is useful in all places and at all times; it is useful 
 in solitude, for it shows a man into the world; it is useful in 
 society, for it shows him his way through the world. 
 
 2. Talent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is 
 momentum ; talent knows what to do, tact knows how to do it ; 
 talent makes a man respectable, tact will make him respected; 
 talent is wealth, tact is ready money. For all the practical pur- 
 poses, tact carries it against talent ten to one. 
 
 3. Take them to the theater, and put them against each 
 other on the stage, and talent shall produce you a tragedy that 
 shall scarcely live long enough to be condemned, while tact 
 keeps the house in a roar, night after night, with its success- 
 ful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent, there is no 
 want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together; so we 
 have successful pieces which are not respectable, and respect- 
 able pieces which are not successful. 
 


## p. 173 (#179) ############################################

AND SPEAKER 173 
 
 4. Take them to the bar and let them shake their learned 
 curls at each other in legal rivalry : talent sees its way clearly, 
 but tact is lirst at its journeys end. Talent has many a com- 
 pliment from the bench, but tact touches fees. Talent makes 
 the world wonder that it gets on no faster, tact arouses as- 
 tonishment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is, that it 
 has no weight to carry ; it makes no false steps ; it hits the 
 right nail on the head ; it loses no time ; it takes all hints ; and, 
 by keeping its eye on the weather-cock, is ready to take ad- 
 vantage of every wind that blows. 
 
 5. Take them into the church: talent has always some- 
 thing worth hearing, tact is sure of abundance of hearers; 
 talent may obtain a living, tact will make one ; talent gets a 
 good name, tact a great one; talent convinces, tact converts; 
 talent is an honor to the profession, tact gains honor from the 
 profession. 
 
 6. Take them to court : talent feels its w T eight, tact finds its 
 way; talent commands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored with 
 approbation, and tact is blessed by preferment. Place them 
 in the senate : talent has the ear of the house, but tact wins 
 its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for employment, but 
 tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping into place with 
 a sweet silence and gfibness of movement, as a billiard-ball in- 
 sinuates itself into the pocket. 
 
 7. It seems to know everything, without learning any 
 thing. It has served an extemporary apprenticeship; it wants 
 no drilling ; it never ranks in the awkw r ard squad ; it has no 
 left hand, no deaf ear; no blind side. It puts on no look of 
 wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profundity, but plays with 
 the details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand flour- 
 ishes over the keys of the piano-forte. It has all the air of 
 common-place, and all the force and power of genius. 
 
 SLOW MOVEMENT. 
 
 Slow Movement is used in the expression of sentiments of 
 reverence, solemnity, sublimity, grandeur, pathos, aive, melan- 
 choly, despair, gloom, adoration and devotion.

 Death of the Wife. 
 
 Slozv Movement. 
 
 A most impressive recitation when well rendered. Keep 
 the tone pure and force subdued. Let the pitch vary with the 
 change of sentiment. Be natural — be sincere. 
 
 i. She had lain all day in a stupor, breathing with heavy- 
 laden breath, but as the sun sank to rest in the far-off western 
 sky, and the red glow on the wall of the room faded into dense 
 shadows, she awoke and called feebly to her aged partner, who 
 was sitting motionless by the bed-side. He bent over his dying 
 wife and took her wan, wrinkled hand in his. 
 
 2. "Is it night ?" she asked in tremulous tones, looking 
 at him with eyes that saw not. 
 
 "Yes," he answered softly; "it is growing dark." 
 "Where are the children?" she queried; "are they all in?" 
 
 3. Poor old man! How could he answer her? The chil- 
 dren had slept for years in the old churchyard. 
 
 "The children are safe," answered the old man, trem- 
 ulously; "don't think of them, Jane. Think of yourself. Does 
 the way seem dark?" 
 
 4. "My trust is in Thee. Let me never be confounded. 
 What does it matter if the way is dark?" 
 
 "I'd rather walk with God in the dark, than walk alone in 
 the light." 
 
 "I'd rather walk with Him by faith, than walk alone by 
 sight." 
 
 5. "John, where's little Charley?" she asked. Her mind 
 was again in the past. The grave dust of twenty years had lain 
 on Charley's golden hair, but the mother had never forgotten 
 him. The old man patted her cold hands that had labored 
 so hard that they were seamed and wrinkled and calloused 
 with years of toil, and the wedding ring was worn to a mere 
 thread of gold — and then he pressed his lips to them and cried ; 
 they had encouraged and strengthened him in every trial of 
 life. Why, what a woman she had been! What a leader in 
 Israel! Always with the gift of prayer or service. They had 
 stood at many a death-bed together — closed eyes of loved ones,

 and then sat down with the Bible between them to read the 
 promise. Now she was about to cross the dark river alone. 
 
 C. And it was strange and sad to the yellow-haired grand- 
 daughter left them to hear her babble of walks in the woods, 
 of gathering May flowers and strolling with John, of petty 
 household cares that she had always put down with strong, 
 resolute hand, of wedding feasts and death bed triumphs; and 
 when at midnight she heard the Bridegroom's voice, and the 
 old man, bending over her, cried pitifully, and the grand- 
 daughter kissed her pale brow, there was a solemn joy in her 
 voice as she spoke the names of her children, one by one, as if 
 she saw them with immortal eyes, and with one glad smile put 
 on immortality. 
 
 7. They led the old man sobbing away, and when he saw 
 her again the glad morning sun was shining, the air was 
 jubilant with the song of birds, and she lay asleep on the 
 couch under the north window where he had seen her so often 
 lie down to rest while waiting for the Sabbath bell. And she 
 w r ore the same black silk, and the string of gold beads about 
 her thin neck and the folds of white tulle. Only now the 
 brooch with his miniature was wanting, and in its place was a 
 white rose and a spray of cedar — she had loved cedar — she had 
 loved to sing over her work : 
 
 "Oh, may I in His courts be seen, 
 Like a young cedar, fresh and green. " 
 
 8. But the strange transformations that were there ! The 
 wrinkles were gone. The traces of age and pain and weari- 
 ness were smoothed out ; the face had grown strangely young, 
 and a placid smile was on the pale lips. The old man was awed 
 by this likeness to the bride of his youth. He kissed the un- 
 responsive lips, and then said softly: 
 
 9. "You have found heaven first, Janet, but you'll come 
 for me soon. It's our first parting in more than seventy years, 
 but it won't be for long!" 
 
 10. And it was not. The winter snow has not yet fallen, 
 and there is another grave, and today would have been their 
 diamond wedding ! We had planned much for it, and I wonder 
 — I wonder — but no ! Where they are there is neither mar- 
 riage nor giving in marriage.

 First a soft and gentle tinkle, 
 Gentle as the rain-drop's sprinkle, 
 
 Then a stop, 
 
 Fingers drop ; 
 Now begins a merry trill, 
 Like a cricket in a mill ; 
 Now a short, uneasy motion, 
 Like a ripple on the ocean, 
 See the fingers dance about, 
 Hear the notes come tripping out ; 
 How they mingle in the tingle 
 Of the everlasting jingle, 
 Like to hailstones on a shingle, 
 Or the dingdong, dangle-dingle. 
 Of a sheep-bell ! Double, single, 
 Now they come in wilder gushes, 
 Up and down the player rushes, 
 Quick as squirrels, sweet as thrushes. 
 Now the keys begin to clatter 
 Like the music of a platter 
 When the maid is stirring batter. 
 O'er the music comes a change ; 
 Every tone is wild and strange ;

 Now 'tis louder, but the powder 
 
 Will be all exploded soon;

 MELODY. 
 
 Melody (Gr. szuect song) is a succession of pleasing tones 
 having but a limited compass above or below the initial note, 
 with prevailing pitch above the natural. 
 
 i. Melody is one of the most valuable elements the 
 speaker may employ in attracting and retaining the attention 
 of an audience. 
 
 2. The element is employed in those rhythmical compo- 
 sitions, whether prose or poetry, expressing pathos, tranquil 
 pleasure and peaceful repose. 
 
 3. To cultivate melodious tones, practice frequently upon 
 such words as calm, name, mine, thine, wailing, gone, moaning, 
 mound, home, throne, wandering, etc., with effusive utterance, 
 pure tone, subdued force, median stress, slightly elevated 
 pitch, and long quantity, imparting to your utterance a rich 
 musical intonation. Let the tones be sweet, clear, and musical.

 Excellent for the cultivation of clear, sweet, mellow and 
 musical tones. Let the utterance be mainly effusive, the tone 
 pure, the force moderate, the prevailing stress median and the 
 movement moderate. Avoid affectation. 
 
 i. Those evening bells, those evening bells! 
 How many a tale their music tells 
 Of youth and home and that sweet time 
 When last I heard their soothing chime ! 
 
 2. Those joyous hours are passed away; 
 And many a heart that then was gay 
 Within the tomb now darkly dwells, 
 And hears no more those evening bells. 
 
 3. And so 'twill be when I am gone : 
 That tuneful peal will still ring on ; 
 While other bards shall walk these dells, 
 And sing your praise, sweet evening bells. 
 
 When the Cows Come Home. 
 
 Apply the same elements as above to this selection. Give 
 it frequent practice, and your tones will be much improved. 
 
 1. When klingle, klangle, klingle, 
 
 Far down the dusty dingle, 
 The cows are coming home; 
 
 Now sweet and clear, now faint and low, 
 
 The airy tinklings come and go, 
 
 Like chimings from the far-off tower. 
 
 Or patterings of an April shower 
 
 That make the daisies grow; 
 Ko-ling, ko-lang, kolinglelingle, 
 Far down the darkening dingle, 
 The cows come slowly home.

 By threes and fours and single

ORIGINAL DISCOURSE. 
 
 r. Thus far the student has been instructed only in the 
 manner of expressing the thoughts of others, While the ability 
 to comprehend instantly and to render effectively an author's 
 thought's as outlined upon the printed page, is an accomplish- 
 ment of great value to all, such an attainment is not sufficient 
 for the broad and general culture required by our times and 
 institutions. 
 
 2 The responsibilities thrust upon us by the republican 
 form of government under which we live, perpetuated in its 
 purity and efficiency by the logic of a Choate, the wisdom of a 
 Webster, and the eloquence of a Clay, demand attainments of 
 a higher order than mere skill in the pathetic, forcible, or 
 eloquent repetition of some popular composition. 
 
 3. The citizen who would form at least a unit in the Re- 
 public must be competent to wield the pen, and when called 
 upon, be prepared to address his countrymen intelligently upon 
 the questions of the day. His duty to himself and country de- 
 mand that whether he write or speak, his performance should 
 be creditable and effective. 
 
 4. A ready, vigorous pen and speech, like reading and 
 declamation, come from instruction, practice and criticism. 
 
 EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEECH. 
 
 I. The greatest excellence to which the student, ambitious 
 of oratorical fame, may aspire, is comprised in the ability to 
 spreak fluently, logically, and effectively, upon any subject, at 
 any time, without previous preparation.

 2. This accomplishment may be termed "thinking on one's 
 feet." It is not the result of any spontaneous development. It 
 comes from study, practice! —work. 
 
 3. The power to charm the heart, and steal away the 
 senses, to divert the mind from its own devisings, and hold an 
 audience in breathless spell, as the orator paints the rosy tints 
 of heavenly longings, or leads the imagination down through 
 the labyrinths of wonderland, or depicts with lightning tongue 
 and thunder tones, the horrors of the doomed, comes not by 
 nature, but by work, — work, — work. 
 
 4. Whether this so-called gift be assisted by the early 
 efforts of a Demosthenes declaiming over the sea-beat cliffs of 
 Attica, or the harangues of a youthful Clay before a group of 
 oxen, perfection in delivery is attained only by frequent and 
 long-continued practice, based upon accurate observation and 
 zealous study. 
 
 THE TWO FORMS OF EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEECH. 
 
 I. CONVERSATION. 
 
 2. PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
 
 1. Conversation is the general and familiar interchange of 
 sentiments. 
 
 2. Xo form of social intercourse furnishes so much human- 
 izing enjoyment as -pleasing and entertaining conversation. 
 Notwithstanding the pleasure it affords, few people, even among 
 the educated classes, are capable of entertaining a company by 
 continuous, intelligent discourse. 
 
 3. The student is here reminded that unconnected remarks, 
 followed by ambiguous or meaningless monosyllabic rejoinders, 
 interspersed with nauseating repetition of such expletives as 
 "Yes, indeed,'' "You don't say so/' "You bet," etc., do not con- 
 stitute elevating discourse. 
 
 4. Conversation is an art, and as such it is capable of cul-

186 brown's standard elocution 
 
 tivation to approximate perfection. Success in the higher forms 
 of speech depends upon the conversational skill of the aspirant 
 for oratorical honors. 
 
 GENERAL RULES FOR CONVERSATION. 
 
 1. Breathe without gasping or attracting attention. 
 
 2. Articulate distinctly, but do not impress your hearers 
 with the idea that you are going through an exercise in vocal 
 gymnastics. 
 
 3. Be natural; remember it is yourself you are imperson- 
 ating, and you will be judged accordingly. 
 
 4. In general, use a full, pure tone, moderate force, radical 
 stress, middle pitch, and moderate movement. In those parts 
 of your conversation requiring peculiar description and person- 
 ation, use the appropriate elements. 
 
 5. Enter into the spirit of the subject with all your mind. 
 Cultivate the habit of listening to others. This is at least polite. 
 Attention to what others say is the relay from which you are 
 enabled to continue your part of the conversation intelligibly 
 and agreeably to the other members of your company. 
 
 6. Avoid pedantry, affectation, and all mannerisms calcu- 
 lated to detract from the general topic of conversation. 
 
 7. Conceive, summon, and express your best thoughts. 
 
 8. Employ the simplest, purest, and most expressive langu- 
 age at your command. 
 
 9. Avoid unpleasant personalities, particularly with refer- 
 ence to those who are absent. 
 
 10. Avoid topics of little general interest to your listeners. 
 
 11. However familiar to the company the condition of the 
 weather and streets may be, their prolonged discussion is not 
 sufficiently important to justify more than a passing remark. 
 
 12. Indulge sparingly in raillery and cutting repartee. A 
 merciless wit is never esteemed above a treacherous weapon.

 GENERAL RULES FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
 
 1. Public extemporaneous speaking is the delivery of sen- 
 timent without previous written preparation. 
 
 2. The speaker employs the same elements as in conversa- 
 tion, btit upon an enlarged scale. To these he may, as occasion 
 requires, add depth and fullness to his quality, producing the 
 grand tones of the Orotund; he may increase his fofce, raise 
 his pitch, and indulge in a greater variety of stress, movement, 
 and pauses than in ordinary conversation. In addition to these 
 departures he may energize and embellish his delivery by 
 gesture and facial expression ; and, generally, he may play upon 
 the accidental elements in arousing the emotions of an audience 
 more than would be proper in the most animated conversation. 
 
 3. Of all professions recognized by civilized man, probably 
 none requires in its perfection so many and varied accomplish- 
 ments as that of oratory. The public lecturer who leads the 
 van in the march of science for the improvement of society; the 
 statesman, who guards the nation's rights and shapes his 
 country's destiny; the man of God, who seeks to purify the 
 human heart and save a fallen race — all must wield the won- 
 drous power of speech. 
 
 4 How far the orators of the past have possessed this 
 comprehensive art of arts is largely answered in the social, 
 governmental, and religious freedom of modern times. 
 
 GENERAL REQUISITES. 
 
 I The orator should have a liberal education. 
 
 2. He should be actuated by the noblest impulses. 
 
 3. He should be endowed with the highest attributes of 
 humanity. 
 
 4. Every physical organ should be subordinate to the will. 
 
 5. He should possess the most extended information upon 
 


## p. 188 (#194) ############################################

188 brown's standard elocution 
 
 all subjects. To this end, he should have frequent practice in 
 reading, conversation, speaking and writing, 
 
 6. The summation of all these qualifications, Cicero tells 
 us, marks the perfect man. 
 
 SPECIFIC RULES FOR EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEAKING. 
 
 1. Have something to say worth hearing. 
 
 2. Know more of your subject than do any of your 
 auditors. 
 
 3. Be wide awake and thoroughly in earnest. 
 
 4. Believe and feel intensely all you say. 
 
 5. Merge yourself into the thoughts you are uttering. 
 
 6. Look into the eyes of your hearers, not over their heads. 
 
 7. Cultivate facility and elegance of expression by using 
 good language at all times. 
 
 8. Endeavor to hold your hearers that they may not wander 
 from the subject. 
 
 9. Be yourself ; you cannot personate another with your 
 ideas. 
 
 10. Never lose control of your thoughts, your breath, your 
 speech, or your temper. 
 
 11. Avoid all forms of slang; no speaker ever exhausted the 
 English language. 
 
 12. Have a complete mastery of all the elements of elocu- 
 tion — thus your body and limbs are made subjective to the 
 mental powers. 
 
 13. Think only of zchat you are going to say; your gram- 
 mar, rhetoric and elocution will suggest the manner, 
 
 14. If you have five or ten minutes for preparation, think 
 of the proposition only. 
 
 15. Command a faultless articulation, an accurate pronun- 
 ciation, and an absolute control of the essential elements of 
 vocal expression. 
 


## p. 189 (#195) ############################################

AN] ER 1&9 
 
 1 6. Carefully study the speeches of eminent orators known 
 to be extemporaneous, consider the time, place and circum- 
 stance of their delivery. 
 
 17. Study the models furnished by Demosthenes, Cicero, 
 Fox. Sheridan, Burke, Webster and Clay, and modern orators 
 of recognized ability. 
 
 18. Maintain a constant reserve; the orator must appear 
 greater than his theme or his effort. 
 
 19. Hold yourself flexibly erect with an active chest. The 
 weight should be supported mainly on the balls of the feet, 
 not the heels. 
 
 20. Keep the voice and speech organs moist, not by drink, 
 but by chewing a bit of paper just before using the voice. 
 
 21. Avoid great force in the beginning by studied distinct- 
 ness and deliberate movement. Your audience must be led by 
 measured tones of persuasion gradually up to the more in- 
 tensified forms of expression. 
 
 22. In passing from one sentiment or emotion to another, 
 strive to feel the emotion before attempting its utterance ; words 
 without feeling awake no responsive chord among your hearers. 
 
 23. Commit and frequently recite aloud a few excellent pass- 
 ages abounding in decided sentiment, absorbing emotion and 
 vehement passion. The possession of the words give the mind 
 opportunity to dwell upon the thoughts, and thus their frequent 
 conception and utterance trains the nerves, muscles and vocal 
 organs to command the required expression at will. 
 
 24. Stop the moment you are done. 
 
 SPEAKING FROM NOTES. 
 
 I. When the speaker has sufficient time to collect and 
 arrange his thoughts, he should endeavor to think of all he 
 wishes to say upon the subject, and write the heads of his 
 thoughts as they occur, and afterward arrange them in the most 
 appropriate order. 
 


## p. 190 (#196) ############################################

190 brown's standard elocution 
 
 2. In general, the most pleasing and entertaining matter 
 should appear first. The auditors are never so critical as when 
 the speaker steps upon the platform. An unfavorable impres- 
 sion once made is too difficult to overcome to justify the speak- 
 er's giving it an occasion. 
 
 3. The closing thoughts should possess merit and original- 
 ity, and should be spoken with such sincerity, vigor and elo- 
 quence that an audience shall respect at least the advocate, if 
 not the sentiment he utters. 
 
 4. Do not be tedious. Do not labor to exhaust your theme. 
 When you can no longer talk without stopping to think what 
 next to say, you are done, and should stop at once. 
 
 Method of Criticism. 
 
 The following plan of estimating the merits of a speaker's 
 performance, introduced into a number of literary societies by 
 the author, is recommended. It will prove valuable to critics 
 of literary societies. The table should be prepared on printed 
 sheets and the name of the performer written in the blank, with 
 the proper answer placed after each question. This sheet so 
 prepared by the critic, and given to the performer, would afford 
 the latter much greater benefit than is conferred by the usual 
 imperfect systems of criticisms.

MISCELLANEOUS SELECTIONS. 
 
 An American Exile. 
 
 isaac hixton brown. 
 
 i. In Norfolk Bay, long years ago, where waved 
 The nation's flag from mizzen gaff 
 Of frigate, sloop, and other warlike craft, 
 A group of naval officers, assembled 
 On the flag-ship's quarter-deck, discussed 
 With earnestness the act by which the State 
 Of South Carolina annulled 
 The tariff laws of Congress. 
 The President's prompt act, 
 Despatching Scott to Charleston, ordering 
 The execution of the laws by force, 
 Had thrilled the nerves of those who bore 
 Their country's arms. 
 
 2. The naval service boasted many men 
 
 Who traced through veins as chivalrous as their sire's 
 
 The blood of Sumter, Pickens, Hayne, 
 
 And other revolutionary patriots ; 
 
 And, conscious of a lineage illustrious 
 
 From those who gave the grand Republic birth, 
 
 Their minds were often filled with polities 
 
 Of State ; and thus the acts of courts 
 
 And legislatures oft became their theme 
 
 In time of peace as much as warlike deeds 
 
 Of Neptune. 
 
 3. One of these, in this debate, 
 
 A handsome, sun-bronzed officer of most 
 Commanding mien, became conspicuous 
 
 193 
 


## p. 194 (#200) ############################################

 In warm approval of his State's rash act 
 
 And censure strong of President 
 
 And Congress. While his flashing eye betrayed 
 
 The fierce emotions of his soul, his voice 
 
 Rang fearful maledictions : "Curse the country 
 
 Whose flag from yonder mizzen floats ; the men 
 
 Be cursed, who in the name of government 
 
 Ignore the rights my native State has held supreme. ,, 
 
 4. Then drawing forth his rapier 
 
 As if in frenzied rage : "My sword's my own, 
 
 My heart is loyal to my native State ; 
 
 And here I swear, this blade shall ne'er be drawn 
 
 But in defense of rights this tyrant thing 
 
 Called government usurps, and those its threats 
 
 Would terrify. Its flag be trailed in dust; 
 
 The fate of Carthage be its cursed doom! 
 
 The memory of its present acts, with those 
 
 Who give them shape, go down in blood and shame !" 
 
 5. Such direful imprecations shocked the ears 
 
 Of those who heard ; and, ere the speechless group 
 Recovered from their blank amaze, a young 
 Lieutenant felled the speaker senseless to 
 The deck; then quick before the officer 
 Commanding, preferred the charge of treason. 
 
 6. Court-martial trials are speedy in results, 
 The sentence, novel in its terms, was heard 
 With unfeigned haughtiness and scorn by him 
 Whom it deprived of country : 
 
 "The prisoner, hence, for life, shall be consigned 
 To vessels cruising in a foreign sea ; 
 No tongue to him shall speak his country's name, 
 Nor talk to him of aught save daily wants ; 
 And ever to his sight that country's flag 
 Shall be a token that its power lives 
 To carry out this sentence."

AND SPEAKER 195 
 
 In far-off seas, away from kindred hearts 
 
 And native home, the years passed slowly on ; 
 
 But pride and stubborn will did not desert 
 
 This strange misguided man; his fate he seemed 
 
 To cherish for the cause he still believed 
 
 Would triumph in the end. 
 
 Yet to and fro his narrow bounds he paced, 
 
 Alone amid a frigate's crew. No cheering word 
 
 His yearning heart in time could e'er expect 
 
 From stricken mother, weeping wife, and babes 
 
 By him made worse than orphans, who might blush 
 
 To call him father. Still, above, around, 
 
 In sportive play, the flag he madly cursed, as star 
 
 By star was added to its field of blue, 
 
 In gorgeous folds waved kindly o'er his head, 
 
 As if forgiving his ingratitude. 
 
 And now, as other years rolled sadly by, 
 
 And he was passed from ship to ship, as each 
 
 In turn went home, the lines of grief and frosts 
 
 Of age bore silent evidence of slow decay. 
 
 In time his face was marked with pensive cast, 
 
 A harbinger of sad, repentant thought. 
 
 A sailor, unperceived, took note of him, 
 
 And oft observed him watch the waving flag 
 
 With strange emotion. And once his lips 
 
 Were seen to move : "Thou ever-present curse, 
 
 Reminding me of what I am, of what 
 
 IVe lost, thou Nemesis of nature's wrongs! 
 
 For that I've sinned against my birth, my soul's 
 
 Remorse affirms. How long e'er nature's laws, 
 
 More kind than human heart, will free my eyes 
 
 From thee, thou vengeful witness of my shame? 
 
 I'd tear thee from thy staff, — but when I think 
 
 Of all the tears thou'st witnessed in these eyes, 
 
 At first my curses, then my prayers to God, 
 
 Of secret thoughts conceived within thy sight, 
 
 Thou seem'st so much a friend, I would not blot 
 
 From out thy field a single star — and yet — and yet — 
 
 O soul, when will thy mad resentment cease'"

 9. Full thirty years had passed since sound 
 Of friendly voice had filled his ear, and now 
 He paced another deck than one designed 
 For heavy armament, — a merchant craft, 
 Commissioned while the nation's ships of war 
 Were called for duty home to try the cause 
 For which this poor, deluded exile gave 
 His manhood and his life. 
 
 10. Near set of sun 
 
 The cry of "sail" was heard, and then, 
 
 Against his will, they hurried him below. 
 
 The startling call to quarters reached his ear ; 
 
 And e'er the roll of drum and boatswain's whistle died 
 
 away 
 There came a distant "boom" that roused a hope 
 He yearned to realize. A moment more, 
 A deaf 'ning sound that shook the very keel 
 Awoke his heart with joy. He knew and hailed 
 The truth. The land, — his land was now at war. 
 The foe — his name, it mattered not to him — 
 Had struck the challenge blow and filled his soul 
 With fire. 
 
 11. O love of Country! Thou art lasting as 
 The faith of childhood. Thou art stronger than 
 The love of life, — the fear of death ! 
 
 This exiled penitent, this prodigal 
 Without a home, would prove himself a man! 
 He cried for help to free him from his bonds : 
 "Ahoy there ! Men on deck ! For love of God 
 Let me not perish in this cell. Unbar the door, 
 Take off these chains, and arm me for the fight ! 
 O give me air and light beneath the flag ; 
 My blood will wash away my curse!" but all 
 Was vain. 
 
 12. A tearing shot, that ploughed through side 
 And prison bulkhead walls, made clear 
 
 A passage wide enough through which 
 He sought his wild desire.

 But e'er he reached the deck, the foe had lashed 
 His ship beside, and countless fierce wild men 
 Were leaping down among the feeble crew, 
 Who battled hard, but vain, against such odds. 
 
 13. He saw the flag the enemy displayed, 
 • A flag unknown, unseen by him before, 
 
 Though strangely like the one he cursed, — now loved 
 So much — would die in its defense. 
 He wrenched a cutlass from a dying hand. 
 And hewed his way among the privateers. 
 Where'er he struck, the way was cleared of men 
 Like wheat before the blade. His strange demean 
 And antique garb amazed the foe, until 
 It seemed he'd drive the boarders to their ships. 
 At last, his wounds o'ercame his madd'ning strength, 
 And sinking to his knee, was soon disarmed, 
 But spared the murd'rous stroke by one who knew 
 His name and story from a child. 
 His glazing eye turned wistful toward the flag, 
 Now drooping low, as if to mourn for him: — 
 "My country ! thou art now avenged ! my life— 
 My wasted life, — I give to thee — to thee." 
 
 Ambition of a Statesman, 
 henry clay. 
 
 1. I have been accused of ambition in presenting this 
 measure — ambition, inordinate ambition. If I had thought of 
 myself only, I should never have brought it forward. I know* 
 well the perils to which I expose myself; the risk of alienating 
 faithful and valued friends, with but little prospect of making 
 new ones, if any new ones could compensate for the loss of 
 those we have long tried and loved ; and the honest misconcep- 
 tion both of friends and foes. 
 
 2. Ambition? If I had listened to its soft and seducing 
 whispers; if I had yielded myself to the dictates of a cold, cal- 
 culating and prudential policy, I would have stood still and un-

 moved. I might even have silently gazed on the raging storm, 
 enjoyed its loudest thunders, and left those who are charged 
 with the care of the vessel of state to conduct it as they could. 
 
 3. I have been heretofore, often unjustly, accused of am- 
 bition. Low, groveling souls, who are utterly incapable of 
 elevating themselves to the higher and nobler duties of pure 
 patriotism — beings who, forever keeping their own selfish ends 
 in view, decide all public measures by their presumed influence 
 on their aggrandizement — judge me by the venal rule which 
 they prescribe to themselves. I have given to the winds those 
 false accusations, as I consign that which now impeaches my 
 motives. 
 
 4. I have no desire for office, not even the highest. The 
 most exalted is a prison, in which the incarcerated incumbent 
 daily receives his cold, heartless visitants, marks his weary 
 hours, and is cut off from the practical enjoyment of all the 
 blessings of genuine freedom. I am no candidate for any office 
 in the gift of the people of these States, united or separated; 
 I never wish, never expect to be. 
 
 5. Pass this bill, tranquilize the country, restore con- 
 fidence and affection in the Union, and I am willing to go home 
 to Ashland, and renounce public service forever. I should 
 there find, in its groves, under its shades, on its lawns, 'midst 
 my flocks and herds, in the bosom of my family, sincerity and 
 truth, attachment and fidelity and gratitude, which I have not 
 always found in the walks of public life. 
 
 6. Yes, I have ambition ; but it is the ambition of being the 
 humble instrument, in the hands of Providence, to reconcile a 
 divided people ; once more to revive concord and harmony in 
 a distracted land — the pleasing ambition of contemplating the 
 glorious spectacle of a free, united, prosperous and fraternal 
 people. 
 
 Stand by the Flag, 
 joseph holt. 
 
 1. Let us twine each thread of the glorious tissue of our 
 country's flag about our heart-strings, and, looking upon our 
 homes and catching the spirit that breathes upon us from the 
 battle-fields of our fathers, let us resolve that, come weal or

 woe, we will in life and in death, now and forever, stand by 
 the Stars and Stripes. They have floated over our cradles ; let 
 it be our prayer and our struggle that they shall float over our 
 graves. They have been unfurled from the snows of Canada 
 to the plains of New Orleans, to the halls of the Montezumas, 
 and amid the solitude of every sea, and everywhere, as the 
 luminous symbol of resistless and beneficient power, they have 
 led the brave and the free to victory and to glory. 
 
 2. It has been my fortune to look upon this flag in foreign 
 lands, and amid the gloom of an Oriental despotism, and right 
 well do I know, by contrast, how bright are its stars and how 
 sublime its inspirations! If this banner, the emblem for us of 
 all that is grand in human history, and of all that is transport- 
 ing in human hope, is to be sacrificed on the altars of a satanic 
 ambition, and thus disappear forever amid the night and 
 tempest of revolution, then will I feel (and who shall estimate 
 the desolation of that feeling?) that the sun has indeed been 
 stricken from the sky of our lives, and that henceforth we shall 
 be wanderers and outcasts, with naught but the bread of sorrow 
 and of penury for our lips, and with hands ever outstretched 
 with feebleness and supplication, on which, in any hour, a 
 military tyrant may rivet the fetters of a despairing bondage. 
 May God in His infinite mercy save you and me, and the land 
 we so much love, from the doom of such a degradation. 
 
 3. No contest so momentous as this has arisen in human 
 history, for, amid all the conflicts of men and of nations, the 
 life of no such government as ours has ever been at stake. 
 Our fathers won our independence by the blood and sacrifice 
 of a seven years' war, and we have maintained it against the 
 assaults of the greatest power upon the earth ; and the question 
 now is, whether we are to perish by our own hands, and have 
 the epitaph of suicide written upon our tomb. The ordeal 
 through which we are passing must involve immense suffering 
 and losses for us all, but the expenditure of not merely hun- 
 dreds of millions, but of billions, will be well made, if the result 
 shall be the preservation of our institutions. 
 
 4. Could my voice reach every dwelling in Kentucky, I 
 would implore its inmates — if they would not have the rivers 
 of their prosperity shrink away, as do unfed streams beneath 
 the summer heats — to rouse themselves from their lethargy,

 and fly to the rescue of their country before it is everlastingly 
 too late. Man should appeal to man, and neighborhood to 
 neighborhood, until the electric fires of patriotism shall flash 
 from heart to heart in one unbroken current throughout the 
 land. 
 
 5. It is a time in which the workshop, the office, the count- 
 ing-house and the field may well be abandoned for the solemn 
 duty that is upon us, for all these toils will but bring treasure, 
 not for ourselves, but for the spoiler, if this revolution is not 
 arrested. We are all, with our every earthly interest, em- 
 barked in mid-ocean on the same common deck. The howl of 
 the storm is in our ears, and "the lightning's red glare is paint- 
 ing hell on the sky," and while the noble ship pitches and rolls 
 under the lashings of the waves, the cry is heard that she has 
 sprung a-leak at many points, that the rushing waters are 
 mounting rapidly in the hold. The man who, at such an hour, 
 will not work at the pumps is either a maniac or a monster.

 1. "Rock of ages cleft for me," 
 
 Thoughtlessly the maiden sung ; 
 Fell the words unconsciously 
 
 From her girlish, gleeful tongue; 
 Sang as little children sing; 
 
 Sang as sing the birds in June ; 
 Fell the words like light leaves down 
 
 On the current of the tune — 
 "Rock of ages, cleft for me 
 Let me hide myself in Thee." 
 
 2. "Let me hide myself in Thee" — 
 
 Felt her soul no need to hide. 
 Sweet the song as song could be, 
 
 And she had no thought beside ; 
 All the words unheedingly 
 
 Fell from lips untouched by care,

 Dreaming not that they might be 
 
 On some other lips a prayer ; 
 "Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee!' 
 
 'Rock of ages, cleft for me" — 
 
 'Twas a woman sung them now, 
 Pleadingly and prayerfully; 
 
 Every word her heart did know. 
 Rose the song as storm-tossed bird 
 
 Beats with weary wing the air, 
 Every note with sorrow stirred, 
 
 Every syllable a prayer : 
 ( Rock of ages, cleft for vie, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee!" 
 
 ( Rock of ages, cleft for me" — 
 
 Lips grown aged sung the hymn, 
 Trustingly and tenderly, 
 
 Voice grown weak and eyes grown dim- 
 'Let me hide myself in Thee," 
 
 Trembling though the voice and low, 
 Ran the sweet strain peacefully, 
 
 Like a river in its flow ; 
 Sang as only they can sing 
 
 Who life's thorny path have prest; 
 Sang as only they can sing 
 
 Who behold the promised rest : — 
 "Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee." 
 
 "Rock of ages, cleft for me" — 
 
 Sung above a coffin-lid ; 
 Underneath, all restfully, 
 
 All life's joys and sorrows hid; 
 Nevermore, O storm-tossed soul ! 
 
 Nevermore from wind or tide, 
 Nevermore from billow's roll 
 
 Wilt thou need thyself to hide.

 Could the sightless, sunken eyes,

 i. I, who was always counted, they say, 
 Rather a bad stick any way, 
 Splintered all over with dodges and tricks, 
 Known as the "worst of the Deacon's six;" 
 I, the truant, saucy and bold, 
 The one black sheep in my father's fold, 
 "Once on a time," as the stories say, 
 Went over the hill on a winter's day — 
 Over the hill to the poor-house. 
 
 2. Tom could save what twenty could earn ; 
 
 But givin' was somethin' he ne'er would learn ; 
 Isaac could half o' the Scriptur' speak — 
 Committed a hundred verses a week; 
 Never forgot, an' never slipped ; 
 But "Honor thy father and mother" he skipped; 
 So over the hill to the poor-house! 
 
 3. As for Susan, her heart was kind 
 An' good — what there was of it, mind; 
 Nothin' too big, and nothin' too nice, 
 Nothin' she wouldn't sacrifice

 Was herself, when all was said an' done ; 
 An' Charley an' Becca meant well, no doubt,

 4. An' all o' our folks ranked well, you see, 
 Save one poor fellow, and that was me; 
 An' when, one dark aiv rainy night 
 
 A neighbor's horse went out o' sight, 
 They hitched on me, as the guilty chap 
 That carried one end o' the halter-strap. 
 An' I think, myself, that view of the case 
 Wasn't altogether out o' place; 
 My mother denied it, as mothers do, 
 But I am inclined to believe 'twas true. 
 
 5. Though for me one thing might be said — 
 That I, as well as the horse, was led; 
 And the worst of whiskey spurred me on, 
 
 Or else the deed would have never been done. 
 
 But the keenest grief I ever felt 
 
 Was when my mother beside me knelt, 
 
 An' cried, an' prayed, till I melted down, 
 
 As I wouldn't for half the horses in town. 
 
 I kissed her fondly, then an' there, 
 
 And swore henceforth to be honest and square. 
 
 6. I served my sentence — a bitter pill 
 Some fellows should take who never will ; 
 And then I decided to go "out West," 
 Concludin' 'twould suit my health the best ; 
 Where, how I prospered I never would tell, 
 But Fortune seemed to like me well; 
 
 An' somehow every vein I struck 
 Was always bubbling over with luck. 
 An' better than that I was steady an' true, 
 An' put my good resolutions through. 
 But I wrote to a trusty old neighbor an' said, 
 "You tell 'em, old fellow, that I am dead, 
 An' died a Christian ; 'twill please 'em more, 
 Than if I had lived the same as before." 
 
 7. But when this neighbor he wrote to me, 
 "Your mother's in the poor-house," says he, 
 
 I had a resurrection straightway 
 An' started for her that very day.

 And when I arrived where I was grown, 
 
 I took good care that I shouldn't be known ; 
 
 But I bought the old cottage, through and through, 
 
 Of some one Charley had sold it to ; 
 
 And held back neither work nor gold 
 
 To fix it up as it was of old. 
 
 The same big fire-place, wide and high, 
 
 Flung up its cinders toward the sky ; 
 
 The old clock ticked on the corner shelf — 
 
 I wound it an' set it again myself ; 
 
 An' if everything wasn't just the same, 
 
 Neither I nor money was to blame ; 
 
 Then — over the hill to the poor-house! 
 
 8. One blowing blusterin' winter's day, 
 With a team and cutter I started away; 
 My fiery nags was as black as coal 
 
 (They some'at resembled the horse I stole) ; 
 I hitched, an' entered the poor-house door — 
 A poor old woman was scrubbin' the floor ; 
 She rose to her feet in great surprise, 
 And looked, quite startled, into my eyes; 
 I saw the whole of her trouble's trace 
 In the lines that marred her dear old face ; 
 "Mother!" I shouted, "your sorrows is done! 
 You're adopted along o' your horse-thief son, 
 
 Come over the hill from the poor-house!" 
 
 9. She didn't faint ; she knelt by my side, 
 An' thanked the Lord, till I fairly cried. 
 An' maybe our ride wasn't pleasant and gay, 
 An' maybe she wasn't wrapped up that day ; 
 An' maybe our cottage wasn't warm an' bright, 
 An' maybe it wasn't a pleasant sight, 
 
 To see her a-gettin' the evenin's tea, 
 An' frequently stoppin' an' kissin' me ; 
 An' maybe we didn't live happy for years, 
 In spite of my brothers' and sisters' sneers, 
 Who often said, as I have heard, 
 That they wouldn't own a prison-bird ;

 upon the discovery of distillation. 
 
 1. In your researches after that which you should, at once, 
 have known to be impossible, by the laws of nature, you have 
 opened a fountain of misery which shall flow for ages. You 
 have not contented yourself with pressing out the juices of the 
 fruit bestowed upon you and converting these into strong drink 
 which you need not — but you have taken this strong drink and 
 the harvest, which was given to you for food, and have drawn 
 from these a liquid which is not food and which will not 
 nourish nor sustain your earthly frame. 
 
 2. This liquid shall be a curse upon you and your descend- 
 ants. It shall be known wherever the arts of civilization are 
 known. You shall call it the elixir of life. You shall believe 
 it to be nutritious to the body and gladdening to the soul. The 
 love of it shall grow with the use of it. It shall soothe the 
 solitary hour and cheer the festive board. It shall charm away 
 your griefs, and be the cause of your rejoicings. It shall be

 the inducement to communion and the bond of friendship. It 
 shall be prized alike by the high and the low. It shall be the 
 joy of princes as well as the meanest of mortals. It shall be 
 the stimulant to laborious toil, and the reward for labor done. 
 It shall be bought and sold and make the dealer therein rich. 
 It shall yield abundant revenues to sovereignty. Hospitality 
 shall be dishonored in not offering it to the guest, and the guest 
 shall be disgraced in not receiving it at the hand of his host. 
 
 3. BUT — it shall visit your limbs with palsy; it shall ex- 
 tinguish the pride of man; it shall make the husband hateful 
 to the wife, and the wife loathsome to the husband; it shall 
 annihilate the love of offspring; it shall make members of 
 society a shame and a reproach to each other and to all among 
 whom they dwell. It shall steal from the virtuous and the 
 honorable their good name; and shall make the strong and the 
 vigorous to totter along the streets of cities. 
 
 4. It shall pervert the law of habit, designed to strengthen 
 you in the path of duty, and bind you in its iron chain. It shall 
 disgrace the judge upon the bench, the minister in the sacred 
 desk, and the senator in his exalted seat. It shall make your 
 food tasteless, your mouth to burn as with a fever, and your 
 stomach to tremble as with disease. It shall cause the besotted 
 mother to overlay her newborn, unconscious that it dies be- 
 neath the pressure of her weight ; the natural cravings of the 
 infant shall make it strive to awaken her who has passed, un- 
 heeded, to her last long sleep. 
 
 5. The son shall hide his face that he may not behold his 
 father's depravity, and the father shall see the object of his 
 fondest hopes turn to a foul and bloated carcass, that hurries to 
 the grave. It shall turn the children of men into raving maniacs ; 
 and the broken ties of blood and affection shall find no relief 
 but in the friendly coming of Death. As the seed which man 
 commits to the earth comes forth in that which he converts into 
 spirit, so shall this product of his own invention be as seed in 
 his own heart, to bring forth violence, rapine and murder. 
 
 6. It shall cause man to shut up his fellow-man in the 
 solitude of the grated cell. The prisoner shall turn pale and 
 tremble in his loneliness, at the presence of his own thoughts; 
 he shall come forth to die, in cold blood, by the hand of his 
 fellow, with the spectacle of religious homage on a scaffold,

 and amid the gaze of curious thousands. Poverty shall be 
 made squalid and odious, even so that Charity shall turn away 
 her face in disgust. It shall attract the pestilence that walks, 
 even at noonday, in darkness, tc the very vitals of the drunk- 
 ard, as carrion invites the far-sighted bird of prey. 
 
 7. The consumer of spirit shall be found dead in the high- 
 way, with the exhausted vessel by his side. Yea, the drunk- 
 ard shall kindle a fire in his own bosom which shall not depart 
 from him till he is turned to ashes. The dropsical drunkard 
 shall die in his delirium, and the fluid which has gathered in 
 his brain shall smell like spirit and like spirit shall burn. A 
 feeble frame, an imbecile mind, torturing pain and incurable 
 madness shall be of the inheritance which drunkards bequeath, 
 to run with their blood to innocent descendants. 
 
 8. The wise men, who assembled in the halls of legislation, 
 shall be blind to this ruin, desolation and misery. Nay, they 
 shall license the sale of this poison, and shall require of dig- 
 nified magistrates to certify how much thereof shall be sold 
 for the "Public Good." 
 
 9. This minister of woe and wretchedness shall roam over 
 the earth at pleasure. It shall be found in every country of the 
 Christian ; it shall go into every city, into every village and into 
 every house. But is shall not visit the country of the heathen, 
 nor spread woe and wretchedness among them, but by the 
 hands of Christians. 
 
 10. The light of reason shall at length break upon the be- 
 nighted and afflicted world. The truth shall be told. It shall 
 be believed. The causes of calamity shall be unveiled. The 
 friends of the human race shall speak and be respected. Ra- 
 tional man shall be ashamed of his follies and his crimes, and 
 humbled to the dust that he was so long ignorant of their 
 origin. Governments shall be ashamed that they so long toler- 
 ated and sustained the most costly and cruel foe that man has 
 ever encountered. Avarice itself shall be conscious-stricken 
 and penitent. It shall remain where nature placed it for use; 
 and it shall be odious in the sight of Heaven and of Earth to 
 convert the fruits of the soil into poison.

 Legend of St. Christopher, 
 miss MULOCH. 
 
 [Aprobus, a Syrian blacksmith of renowned stature and 
 wonderful strength, having determined that he would serve 
 none but the mightiest king, went seeking him throughout the 
 world. Failing to find whom he sought so long as he trusted 
 to his own guidance, he finally asked a thoughtful hermit what 
 to do. The hermit directed him to station himself on the bank 
 of a dangerous ford, where many pilgrims yearly lost their 
 lives in crossing, and to carry over all who required his aid; 
 and thus humbly serving his fellow-men, he might serve the 
 greatest King, and hope to see him. 
 
 Ere long, Christ the Lord, who holds the seas in the hollow 
 of his hand, came to the fording place in the guise of a little 
 boy, and asked to be carried over.] 
 
 i. "carry me across/' 
 
 The Syrian heard, rose up, and braced 
 His huge limbs to the accustomed toil : 
 "My child, see how the waters boil! 
 
 The night-black heavens look angry-faced; 
 But life is little loss. 
 
 2. I'll carry thee with joy y 
 If needs be, safe as nestling dove; 
 
 For o'er this stream I pilgrims bring, 
 In service to one Christ, a King 
 Whom I have never seen, yet love!' 
 
 "I thank thee," said the boy. 
 
 3. Cheerful Aprobus took 
 The burden on his shoulders great, 
 
 And stepped into the waves once more — 
 When, lo ! they, leaping, rise and roar ; 
 And 'neath the little child's light weight 
 The tottering giant shook.

 4. "Who art thouf" cried he, wild — ■ 
 Struggling in the middle of the ford, — 
 
 "Boy as thou lookcst, it scons to me 
 The whole world's load 1 bear in thee." 
 "Yet, fot the sake of Christ thy Lord, 
 Carry me," said the child. 
 
 5. Xo more Aprobus swerved, 
 But gained the farther bank ; and then 
 
 A voice cried, "Hence Christopiioros be, 
 For carrying, thou hast carried Me, 
 The King of Axgels and of Men, — 
 
 The Master thou hast served." 
 
 6. And, in the moonlight blue, 
 The saint saw — not the wandering boy, 
 
 But Him who walked upon the sea, 
 And o'er the plains of Galilee, — 
 Till, filled with mystic, awful joy, 
 
 His dear Lord-Christ he knew. 
 
 7. Oh ! little is all loss, 
 
 And brief the space 'twixt shore and shore, 
 
 If thou, Lord Jesus, on us lay, 
 
 Through the deep waters of our way, 
 The burden that Christopiioros bore, — 
 To carry thee across !

 I want free life and I want fresh air; 
 
 And I sigh for the canter after the cattle, 
 
 The crack of the whips like shots in battle, 
 
 The mellay of horns and hoofs and heads 
 
 That wars and wrangles and scatters and spreads ; 
 
 The green beneath and the blue above. 
 
 And dash and danger, and life and love.

 2. And Lasca ! Lasca used to ride 
 
 On a mouse-gray mustang, close to my side, 
 With blue serap and bright-belled spur. 
 I laughed with joy when I looked at her. 
 Little knew she of books or creeds ; 
 An Ave Maria sufficed her needs; 
 Little she cared, save to be by my side, 
 To ride with me, and ever to ride, 
 From San Saba's shore to Lavaca's tide. 
 She was as bold as the billows that beat, 
 She was as wild as the breezes that blow ; 
 From her little head to her little feet 
 She was swayed in her suppleness, to and fro 
 By each gust of passion ; a sapling pine, 
 That glows on the edge of a Kansas bluff, 
 And wars with the wind when the weather is rough, 
 Is like this Lasca, this love of mine. 
 
 3. She would hunger that I might eat, 
 
 Would take the bitter and leave me the sweet ; 
 But once, when I made her jealous for fun, 
 At something I'd whispered, or looked, or done, 
 One Sunday, in San Antonio, 
 To a glorious girl on the Alamo, 
 She drew from her garter a dear little dagger, 
 And — sting of a wasp! — it made me stagger! 
 An inch to the left or an inch to the right, 
 And I shouldn't be maundering here to-night ; 
 But slue sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound 
 Her torn reboso about the wound 
 That I quite forgave her. Scratches don't count 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 4. Her eye was brown — a deep, deep brown ; 
 Her hair was darker than her eye ; 
 
 And something in her smile and frown, 
 Curled crimson lip, and instep high, 
 Showed that there ran in each blue vein, 
 Mixed with the milder Aztec strain, 
 The vigorous vintage of old Spain.

 The air was heavy, the night was hot, 
 J sat by her side, and forgot — forgot; 
 Forgot the herd that were taking their rest; 
 Forgot that the air was elose opprest, 
 That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon ; 
 In the dead of night or the blaze of noon. 
 That once let the herd at its breath take fright, 
 And nothing on earth can stop the flight ; 
 And woe to the rider, and woe to the steed, 
 Who falls in front of their mad stampede ! 
 Was that thunder? No, by the Lord! 
 I sprang to my saddle without a word 
 One foot on mine, and she clung behind, 
 Away on a hot chase down the wind ! 
 But never was fox-hunt half so hard, 
 And never w T as steed so little spared. 
 For we rode for our lives. You shall hear how we fared 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 5. The mustang flew, and we urged him on ; 
 There is one chance left, and you have but one — 
 Halt, jump to ground, and shoot your horse; 
 Crouch under his carcass, and take your chance ; 
 And if the steers, in their frantic course, 
 
 Don't batter you both to pieces at once, 
 You may thank your star; if not, good-bye 
 To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh, 
 And the open air and the open sky, 
 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 6. The cattle gained on us and then I felt 
 For my old six-shooter, behind in my belt ; 
 Down came the mustang, and down came we, 
 Clinging together, and — what was the rest? 
 A body that spread itself on my breast, 
 
 Two arms that shielded my dizzy head, 
 Two lips that hard on my lips were pressed ; 
 Then came thunder in my ears 
 As over us surged the sea of steers ; 
 Blows that beat blood into my eyes, 
 And when I could rise 
 Lasca was dead.

 And there in Earth's arms I laid her to sleep ; 
 
 And where she is lying no one knows, 
 
 And the summer shines and the winter snows ; 
 
 And for many a day the flowers have spread 
 
 A pall of petals over her head; 
 
 And the little gray hawk hangs aloof in the air, 
 
 And the sly coyote trots here and there, 
 
 And the black snake glides and glitters and slides 
 
 Into the rift in a cotton-wood tree;

 "O, Bairnies, Cuddle Doon." 
 
 The following poem, which fairly rivals the most exquisite 
 and tender of Burns' household lyrics, was written by a com- 
 mon Scotch laborer, some fifteen years ago. He was a section-

 in a local paper.

 The mischief's in that Tarn for tricks,

 But aye I hap them up an' say,

 An' as he steeks the door, 
 They turn their faces to the wa ? 
 
 While Tarn pretends to snore. 
 "Hae a' the weans been gude?" he asks 
 
 As he pits afif his shoon. 
 "The bairnies, John, are in their beds, 
 
 An' lang since cuddled doon."

 A Railway Matinee. 
 
 R. J. BURDETTE. 
 
 The last time I ran home over the Chicago, Burlington and 
 Quincy we had a very small, but select and entertaining party 
 on the train. It was a warm day, and everybody was tired 
 with the long ride and oppressed by the heat. The precise 
 woman, with her hat swathed in an immense blue veil, who 
 always parsed her sentences before she uttered them, utterly 
 worn out and thoroughly lonesome, was glad to respond to the 
 pleasant nod of the big rough man who got on at Monmouth, 
 and didn't know enough grammar to ask for the mustard, so 
 that you could tell whether he wanted you to pass it to him or 
 pour it on his hair. 
 
 The thin, troubled-looking man with the sandy goatee, who 
 stammered so dreadfully that he always forgot what he wanted 
 to say before he got through wrestling with any word with a 
 "W" in it, lit up with a tremulous, hesitating smile, as he 
 noticed this indication of sociability, for like most men who

 find it extremely difficult to talk at all, he wanted to talk all 
 the time. 
 
 And the fat old gentleman sitting opposite him, who was so 
 deaf that he could not hear the cars rattle, and always awed 
 and bothered the stammerer into silence by saying "Hey?" in 
 a very imperative tone, every time he got in the middle of a 
 hard word, cocked his irascible head on one side as he saw this 
 smile, and after listening intently to dead silence for a minute, 
 suddenly broke out with such an emphatic, impatient, "Hey?" 
 that everybody in the car started up and shouted nervously 
 and ungrammatically, "I didn't say nothing!" with the excep- 
 tion of the woman with the blue veil, who said: "I said 
 nothing." 
 
 The fat old gentleman was a little annoyed and startled by 
 such a chorus of responses, and fixing his gaze still more in- 
 tently upon the thin man, said defiantly: 
 
 "Wha'say?" 
 
 "I-I-I-I w-w-wuh-wuh-wasn'-wasn' I wasn' s-s-sp — 
 
 speak — " 
 
 "Hey?" roared the fat man. 
 
 "He wa'n't sayin' nauthin'," shouted the big rough man, 
 nodding friendly encouragement to the thin man; "he hain't 
 opened his mouth !" 
 
 "Soap in the South?" queried the fat old gentleman, im- 
 patiently. "Wha' for?" 
 
 "Mouth, mouth," explained the precise woman, with im- 
 pressive nicety. "He said 'opened his mouth.' The gentleman 
 seated directly opposite you was — " 
 
 "Offers to chew what?" cried the fat old gentleman in 
 amazement. 
 
 "Sir," said the precise woman, "I made no reference what- 
 ever to chewing. You certainly misunderstood me." 
 
 The thin man took courage from so many reinforcements, 
 and broke in : 
 
 "I-I-I-I d-d-d-dud-d-u-d-d-u-d-don't don't— I don't ch-ch- 
 ch— " 
 
 "Hey?" shouted the fat gentleman. 
 
 "He don't chaw nauthin'!" roared the big rough man, in 
 a voice that made the car windows rattle. "He wa'n't a talkin' 
 when you shot off at him !'"

 "Who got off?" exclaimed the fat old gentlemen. "Wha'd 
 he get off for?" 
 
 "You don't appear to comprehend clearly what he stated," 
 shrieked the precise woman. "No person has left the train." 
 
 "Then wha'd he say so for?" shouted the fat man. 
 
 "Oh!" said the thin man, in a surprising burst of fluency; 
 "he-he-de-d-d did-did— " 
 
 "Who did?" queried the fat man, talking louder than any 
 one else. 
 
 " X um-num-nimi-num-n-no-nobody. He — he — d d-d-d-dud- 
 didn't didn't s — " 
 
 "Then wha' made you say he did?" howled the deaf man. 
 
 "You misunderstand him," interrupted the precise woman. 
 "He was probably about to remark that no reference what- 
 ever had been intentionally made to the departure of any per- 
 son from the train, when you interrupted him in the midst of 
 an unfinished sentence, and hence obtained an erroneous im- 
 pression of the tenor of his remarks. He meant no offense — " 
 
 "Know a fence?" roared the fat man. "Of course I know a 
 rence !" 
 
 "He hain't got middlin' good hearin," yelled the big man, 
 as apologetically as a steam whistle could have shrieked it. 
 "Y'ears kind of stuffed up !" 
 
 "Time to brush up?" cried the fat man. "Wha' for?" 
 
 "No," shrieked the precise woman ; "he remarked to the 
 other gentleman that your hearing appeared to be rather de- 
 fence!" 
 
 "His father a detective?" hooted the fat gentleman, in 
 amazement. 
 
 "X"-n-n-n-nun-nun-no!" broke in the thin man; "h-h-h-h- 
 huh-huh-he-s-s-sa-sa-said you w-w-w-wuh was a little dud-dud

 "Said I was a thief?" howled the fat man, a scarlet tornado 
 of wrath ; "said I was a thief ! What'd d'ye mean? Show him 
 to me! Who says I'm a thief? Who says so?" 
 
 "Now," shouted the big rough man, "nobody don't say ye 
 ain't no thief. I jest saved as how we didn't git along very 
 well. Ye see he," nodding to the thin man, "he can't talk very

 suspicion. 
 
 "I was sayin'," howled the big rough man, "as how he didn't 
 talk middlin' well—" 
 
 "Should say so," growled the fat man, in tones of intense 
 satisfaction. 
 
 "And," the big rough man went on, yelling with delight at 
 having made the old party hear something, "and you can't hear 
 only tollable—" 
 
 "Can't hear?" the fat old gentleman broke out in a resonant 
 roar. "Can't hear ! Like to know why I can't hear ! Why

 The Man Who Apologized. 
 
 It was at the corner of Woodward avenue and Congress 
 street, and the time was ten o'clock in the forenoon. A citizen 
 who stands solid at two hundred pounds was walking along 
 with bright eyes, and the birds singing in his heart, when all 
 at once he found himself looking up at the cloudy heavens, 
 and a voice up the street seemed to say : — 
 
 "Did you see the old duffer strike that icy spot and claw 
 for grass?" 
 
 Then another voice down the street seemed to say : — 
 
 "You bet I did ! He's lyin' there yit, but he'd get right up 
 if he knew how big his foot looked !" 
 
 The solid citizen did get up. The first thing he saw was 
 the beautiful city spread out before him. The next thing was

AND SPEAKER 219 
 
 a slim man with bone-colored whiskers, who was leaning against 
 a building and laughing as if his heart would break. 
 
 "I can knock your jaw off in three minutes!" exclaimed the 
 citizen, as he fished for the end of his broken suspender. 
 
 The slim man didn't deny it. He hadn't time. He had his 
 hands full to attend to his laughing. The solid man finally 
 found the suspender, counted up four missing buttons and his 
 vest split up the back, and slowly went on, looking back and 
 wondering whether he could be held for damages to the side- 
 walk. He had been in his office about ten minutes, and had 
 just finished telling a clerk that an express team knocked him 
 down, when in came the slim man with bone-colored whiskers. 
 The solid man recognized him and put on a frown, but the 
 other held out his hand and said : — 
 
 "Mister, I came to beg your pardon. You fell on the walk 
 and I laughed at you, but — ha ! ha ! ha ! ! — upon my soul, I 
 couldn't help it. It was the — ha! ha! ha!— funniest sight I 
 ever saw, and — oh ! ho ! ho ! ho ! ha ! ha ! — I couldn't help 
 laughing!" 
 
 "I want none o' your penitence and none o' your company !" 
 sharply replied the solid man, and the other went out. 
 
 In about an hour the "fallen man" had to go over to the 
 express office. The man with the bone-colored whiskers was 
 there with a package, and he reached out his hand and began : — 
 
 "Sir, I ask your forgiveness. I know what belongs to dig- 
 nity and good manners, but — but — ha ! ha ! — when I saw your 
 heels shoot out and your shoulders — ha ! ha ! ha ! — double up, 
 I had to— ho ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ah-h-h-h !" 
 
 "I'll lick you if I ever get a good chance!" remarked the 
 citizen, but yet the man sat down on a box and laughed till 
 the tears came. 
 
 In the afternoon as the citizen was about to take a car for 
 home, some one touched him on the elbow. It was the man 
 with the bone-colored whiskers. His face had a very serious, 
 earnest look, and he began : — 
 
 "Citizen, I am positively ashamed of myself. I am going 
 to settle in Detroit, and shall see you often. I want to ask your 
 forgiveness for laughing at you this morning." 
 
 He seemed so serious that the solid man began to relax his 
 stern look, and he was about to extend his hand, when the 
 other continued : —

 "You see we are all — ha! ha! ha! liable to accident. I, 
 myself, have often — ha ! ha ! ha ! — struck an icy spot and — ho ! 
 ho ! ho ! ha ! ha ! — gone down to grass — ah ! ha ! ho ! ha ! ho ! 
 ha !" 
 
 The solid citizen withdrew his hand, braced his feet, drew 
 his breath and struck to mash the other fine. His foot slipped, 
 and the next he knew he was plowing his nose into the hard 
 snow. When he got up the man with the bone-colored whisk- 
 ers was hanging to a hitching-post, and as black in the face 
 as an old hat. The citizen should have killed him, then and 
 there, but he didn't. He made for a car like a bear going 
 over a brush fence, and his efforts^ to look innocent and un- 
 concerned after he sat down, broke his other suspender dead 
 in two. Such is life. No man can tell what an icy spot will 
 bring forth. 
 
 Beautiful Things, 
 ellen p. allerton. 
 
 1. Beautiful faces are those that wear — 
 It matters but little if dark or fair — 
 Whole-souled honesty printed there. 
 
 2. Beautiful eyes are those that show, 
 
 Like crystal panes where hearth-fires glow, 
 Beautiful thoughts that burn below. 
 
 3. Beautiful lips are those where words 
 Leap from the heart like songs of birds, 
 Yet whose utterance prudence girds. 
 
 4. Beautiful hands are those that do 
 Work that is earnest and brave and true, 
 Moment by moment, the long day through. 
 
 5. Beautiful feet are those that go 
 On kindly ministries, to and fro — 
 Down lowliejst ways, if God wills it so.

 6. Beautiful shoulders are those that bear 
 Ceaseless burdens of hourly care 
 With patient grace and daily prayer. 
 
 7. Beautiful lives are those that bless — 
 Silent rivers of happiness, 
 
 Whose hidden fountains but few may guess. 
 
 8. Beautiful twilight at set of sun, 
 Beautiful goal, with race well won, 
 Beautiful rest, with work well done. 
 
 9. Beautiful graves, where grasses creep, 
 Where brown leaves fall, where drifts lie deep 
 Over worn-out hands — oh, beautiful sleep ! 
 
 Prayer and Potatoes. 
 
 rev. j. t. pettee. 
 
 i. An old lady sat in her old arm chair, 
 
 With wrinkled visage and disheveled hair, 
 
 And pale and hunger-worn features ; 
 For days and for weeks her only fare, 
 As she sat there in her old arm-chair, 
 
 Had been potatoes. 
 
 2. But now they were gone; of bad or good, 
 Xot one was left for the old lady's food 
 
 Of those potatoes ; 
 And she sighed and said, "What shall I do? 
 Where shall I send, and to whom shall I go 
 
 For more potatoes ?" 
 
 3. And she thought of the deacon over the way, 
 The deacon so ready to worship and pray, 
 
 Whose cellar was full of potatoes, 
 And she said, "I will send for the deacon to come ; 
 He'll not mind much to give me some 
 
 Of such a store of potatoes."

 4. And the deacon came over as fast as he could, 
 Thinking to do the old lady some good, 
 
 But never for once of potatoes ; 
 He asked her at once what was her chief want, 
 And she, simple soul, expecting a grant, 
 
 Immediately answered, "Potatoes." 
 
 5. But the deacon's religion didn't lie that way; 
 
 He was more accustomed to preach and to pray, 
 Than to give of his hoarded potatoes ; 
 
 So, not hearing of course, what the old lady said, 
 
 He rose to pray with uncovered head, 
 But she only thought of potatoes. 
 
 6. He prayed for patience, and wisdom, and grace, 
 But when he prayed, "Lord, give her peace/' 
 
 She audibly sighed, "Give potatoes;" 
 And at the end of each prayer which he said, 
 He heard, or thought that he heard in its stead, 
 
 That same request for potatoes. 
 
 7. The deacon was troubled ; knew not what to do ; 
 Twas very embarrassing to have her act so 
 
 About "those carnal potatoes !" 
 So, ending his prayer, he started for home; 
 But, as the door closed behind him, he heard a deep groan, 
 
 "Oh, give to the hungry, potatoes!" 
 
 8. And that groan followed him all the way home ; 
 In the midst of the night it haunted his room — 
 
 "O, give to the hungry, potatoes!" 
 He could bear it no longer ; arose and dressed : 
 From his well-filled cellar taking in haste 
 
 A bag of his best potatoes. 
 
 9. Again he went to the widow's lone hut; 
 Her sleepless eyes she had not shut; 
 But there she sat in that old arm-chair, 
 With the same wan features, the same sad air; 
 And, entering in, he poured on the floor 
 
 A bushel or more from his goodly store, 
 Of choicest potatoes.

 10. The widow's heart leaped up for joy, 
 Her face was haggard and wan no more. 
 "Now," said the deacon, "shall we pray?" 
 "Yes, 1 ' said the widow, "now you may." 
 And he kneeled him down on the sanded floor, 
 Where he had poured his goodly store, 
 And such a prayer the deacon prayed, 
 As never before his lips essayed; 
 Xo longer embarrassed, but free and full, 
 He poured out the voice of a liberal soul, 
 And the widow responded aloud "amen!" 
 But said no more of potatoes. 
 
 ii. And would you, who hear this simple tale, 
 Pray for the poor, and praying, "prevail?" 
 Then preface your prayers with alms and good deeds : 
 Search out the poor, their wants and their needs : 
 Pray for peace, and grace, and spiritual food, 
 For wisdom and guidance — for all these are good — 
 But don't forget the potatoes.

 Then in a voice of trembling pathos, said :

 The white ship lay, like a white sea-bird, 
 With folded wings, asleep.

 For a month not a drop of rain; 
 And the gaunt crew watched in wild despair, 
 With a fever in throat and brain. 
 
 4. And they saw the shore, like a dim cloud stand 
 
 On the far horizon sea; 
 It was only a day's short sail to the land 
 And the haven where they would be.

 6. And the gaunt crew prayed on the decks above 
 
 And the women prayed below : 
 "One drop of rain, for God's great love! 
 O God ! for a breeze to blow !" 
 
 7. But never a shower from the skies would burst, 
 
 And never a breeze would come ; 
 O Heaven ! to think that man can thirst 
 And starve in sight of home.

 The vessel drifted away; 
 Till the far-off shore, like the dim cloud, died, 
 And the wild crew ceased to pray.

 Like beasts with hunger wild ; 
 But a mother knelt in the cabin below, 
 By the bed of her little child.

 No cloud, no sail, in view,

 And she kneeled by the cradle bed: 
 "We thirst, my child, on the lonely deep — 
 We are dying, my child, for bread.

 Not a drop of rain in the sky;

 Not I, but God knows best; 
 And the child rose up from its cradle bed, 
 And crossed its hands on its breast.

 Have pity on mother's pain; 
 For mother's sake a little wind —

 Our Father has heard thy prayer !" 
 
 24. But the child had fallen asleep again; 
 And lo! in its sleep it smiled. 
 "Thank God !" she cried, "for His wind and His rain — 
 Thank God for my little child !" 
 
 1. "Give the Christians to the lions T was the savage Roman's 
 
 cry, 
 And the vestal virgins added their voices shrill and high, 
 And the Caesar gave the order, "Loose the lions from their 
 
 den! 
 For Rome must have a spectacle worthy of gods and 
 
 men." 
 
 2. Forth to the broad arena a little band was led, 
 
 But words forbear to utter how the sinless blood was shed. 
 No sigh the victims proffered, but now and then a prayer 
 From lips of age and lips of youth rose upward on the air ; 
 And the savage Caesar muttered, "By Hercules ! I swear, 
 Braver than gladiators these dogs of Christians are." 
 
 3. Then a lictor bending slavishly, saluting with his axe, 
 Said, "Mighty Imperator! the sport one feature lacks: 
 We have an Afric lion, savage, and great of limb, 
 Fasting since yester even ; is the Grecian maid for him ?" 
 
 4. The Emperor assented. With a frantic roar and bound, 
 The monster, bursting from his den, gazed terribly around, 
 And toward him moved a maiden, slowly, but yet serene ; 
 
 "By Venus !" cried the Emperor, "she walketh like a 
 queen !"

 5. Unconscious of the myriad eyes she crossed the blood- 
 
 soaked sand, 
 Till face to face the maid and beast in opposition stand ; 
 The daughter of Athene, in white arrayed, and fair, 
 Gazed on the monster's lowered brow, and breathed a 
 
 silent prayer, 
 Then forth she drew a crucifix and held it high in air. 
 
 6. Lo, and behold ! a miracle ! the lion's fury fled, 
 
 And at the Christian maiden's feet he laid his lordly head, 
 While as she fearlessly caressed, he slowly rose, and then, 
 With one soft, backward look at her, retreated to his den. 
 One shout rose from the multitude, tossed like a stormy 
 
 sea: 
 "The gods have so decreed it; let the Grecian maid go 
 
 free!" 
 
 7. Within the catacombs that night a saint with snowy hair 
 Folded upon his aged breast his daughter young and fair ; 
 And the gathered brethren lift a chant of praise and 
 
 prayer ; 
 From the monster of the desert, from the heathen fierce 
 
 and wild, 
 God has restored to love and life his sinless, trusting child. 
 
 Speech in Vindication. 
 
 robert emmet. 
 
 I. My Lords : What have I to say, why sentence of death 
 should not be pronounced on me, according to law? I have 
 nothing to say that can alter your predetermination, or that 
 it would become me to say, with any view to the mitigation 
 of that sentence which you are here to pronounce, and which 
 I must abide. But I have much to say which interests me 
 more than that life which you have labored to destroy. I 
 have much to say, why my reputation should be rescued from 
 the load of false accusation and calumny which has been heaped 
 upon it.

 2. Were 1 only to suffer death, after being adjudged guilty 
 by your tribunal, I should bow in silence and meet the fate 
 that awaits me, without a murmur. But the sentence of the 
 law which delivers my body to the executioner, will, through 
 
 "the ministry of that law, labor in its own vindication to con- 
 sign my character to obloquy, for there must be guilt some- 
 where; whether in the sentence of the court or in the catastro- 
 phe, posterity must determine. 
 
 3. When my spirit shall be wafted to a more friendly port ; 
 when my shade shall have joined the bands of those martyred 
 heroes who have shed their blood on the scaffold and in the 
 field, in defense of their country and virtue, — this is my hope: 
 I wish that my memory and name may animate those who 
 survive me, while I look down with complacency on the de- 
 struction of that perfidious government which upholds its 
 domination by blasphemy of the Most High. 
 
 4. My lord, shall a dying man be denied the legal privilege 
 of exculpating himself, in the eyes of the community, from an 
 undeserved reproach thrown upon him during his trial, by 
 charging him with ambition, and attempting to cast away, for 
 a paltry consideration, the liberties of his country? Why, 
 then, insult me? or, rather, why insult justice, in demanding of 
 me why sentence of death should not be pronounced? 
 
 5. I am charged with being an emissary of France! An 
 emissary of France! And for what end? It is alleged that I 
 wished to sell the independence of my country ! And for what 
 end? Was this the object of my ambition? and is this the 
 mode by which a tribunal of justice reconciles contradictions? 
 Xo, I am no emissary; and my ambition was to hold a place 
 among the deliverers of my country ; not in my power, nor in 
 profit, but in the glory of the achievement ! 
 
 6. Sell my country's independence to France ! And for 
 what? Was it for a change of masters? No, but for am- 
 bition ! O my country, was it personal ambition that could 
 influence me! Had it been the soul of my actions, could I not 
 by my education and fortune, by the rank and consideration 
 of my family, have placed myself among the proudest of my 
 oppressors? My country was my idol; to it I sacrificed every 
 selfish, every endearing sentiment ; and for it I now ofifer up 
 my life.

 7. No, my lord; I acted as an Irishman, determined on 
 delivering my country from the yoke of a foreign and unrelent- 
 ing tyranny; and from the more galling yoke of a domestic 
 faction, which is its joint partner and perpetrator in the par- 
 ricide, whose reward is the ignominy of existing with an ex- 
 terior of splendor and a consciousness of depravity. It was the 
 wish of my heart to extricate my country from this doubly- 
 riveted despotism ; I wished to place her independence beyond 
 the reach of any power on earth ; I wished to exalt her to that 
 proud station in the world. 
 
 8. Let no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me with 
 dishonor ! let no man attaint my memory by believing that I 
 could have engaged in any cause but that of my country's 
 liberty and independence; or that I could have become the 
 pliant minion of power in the oppression or the miseries of my 
 countrymen. 
 
 9. I would not have submitted to a foreign oppressor, for 
 the same reason that I would resist the domestic tyrant ; in the 
 dignity of freedom, I would have fought upon the threshold of 
 my country, and her enemy should enter only by passing over 
 my lifeless corpse. Am I, who lived but for my country, and 
 who have subjected myself to the vengeance of the jealous and 
 watchful oppressor, and now the bondage of the grave, only 
 to give my countrymen their rights — am I to be loaded with 
 calumny, and not to be suffered to resent or repel it? No; God 
 forbid ! 
 
 10. If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the 
 concerns and cares of those who are dear to them in this 
 transitory life, O ever dear and venerated shade of my de- 
 parted father ! look down with scrutiny on the conduct of your 
 suffering son, and see if I have even for a moment deviated 
 from those principles of morality and patriotism which it was 
 your care to instill into my youthful mind, and for an adherence 
 to which I am now to offer up my life ! 
 
 11. My lords, you are impatient for the sacrifice. The 
 blood which you seek is not congealed by the artificial terrors 
 which surround your victim; it circulates warmly and unruf- 
 fled through the channels which God created for noble purposes, 
 but which you are bent to destroy for purposes so grievous that 
 they cry to Heaven ! Be yet patient ! I have but a few words

 more to say. I am going to my silent grave; my lamp of life 
 is nearly extinguished ; my race is run ; the grave opens to re- 
 ceive me, and I sink into its bosom. 
 
 12. 1 have but one request to ask, at my departure from 
 this world, — it is the charity of its silence. Let no man write 
 my epitaph ; for, as no one who knows my motives dares now 
 vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. 
 Let them and me repose in obscurity and peace, and my tomb 
 remain uninscribed until other times, and other men, can do 
 justice to my character. When my country shall take her 
 place among the nations of the earth, — then and not till then, 
 — let my epitaph be written ! 
 
 The Last Charge of Xey. 
 
 j. t. headley. 
 
 i. The whole continental struggle exhibited no sublimer 
 spectacle than this last effort of Napoleon to save his sinking 
 empire. Europe had been put upon the plains of Waterloo to 
 be battled for. The greatest military energy and skill the 
 world possessed had been tasked to the utmost during the day. 
 Thrones were tottering on the ensanguined field, and the shad- 
 ows of fugitive kings flitted through the smoke of battle. 
 
 2. Bonaparte's star trembled in the zenith, — now blazing 
 out in its ancient splendor, now suddenly paling before his 
 anxious eye. At length, when the Prussians appeared on the 
 field, he resolved to stake Europe on one bold throw. He com- 
 mitted himself and France to Ney, and saw his empire rest on 
 a single chance. Ney felt the pressure of the immense re- 
 sponsibility on his brave heart, and resolved not to prove un- 
 worthy of the great trust. Nothing could be more imposing 
 than the movement of that grand column to the assault. That 
 Guard had never yet recoiled before a human foe; and the 
 allied forces beheld with aw r e its firm and terrible advance to 
 the final charge. 
 
 3. For a moment the batteries stopped playing, and the 
 firing ceased along the British lines, as, without the beating of 
 a drum, or the blast of a bugle, to cheer their steady courage,

 they moved in dead silence over the plain. The next moment 
 the artillery opened, and the head of that gallant column 
 seemed to sink into the earth. Rank after rank went down; 
 yet they neither stopped nor faltered. Dissolving squadrons, 
 and whole battalions disappearing one after another in the de- 
 structive fire, affected not their steady courage. The ranks 
 closed up as before, and each, treading over his fallen comrade, 
 pressed firmly on. 
 
 4. The horse which Ney rode fell under him, and he had 
 scarcely mounted another before it also sank to the earth. 
 Again and again did that unflinching man feel his steed sink 
 down, till five had been shot under him. Then, with his uni- 
 form riddled with bullets, and his face singed and blackened 
 with powder, he marched on foot, with drawn sabre, at the 
 head of his men. In vain did the artillery hurl its storm of 
 fire and lead into that living mass. Up to the very muzzles 
 they pressed, and, driving the artillerymen from their own 
 pieces, pushed on through the English lines. 
 
 5. But at the moment a file of soldiers who had lain flat 
 on the ground, behind a low ridge of earth, suddenly rose, and 
 poured a volley in their very faces. Another and another 
 followed, till one broad sheet of flame rolled on their bosoms, 
 and in such a fierce and unexpected flow that human courage 
 could not withstand it. They reeled, shook, staggered back, 
 then turned and fled. 
 
 6. Ney was borne back in the refluent tide, and hurried 
 over the field. But for the crowd of fugitives that forced him 
 on, he would have stood alone, and fallen in his footsteps. As 
 it was, disdaining to fly, though the whole army was flying, he 
 formed his men into two immense squares, and endeavored to 
 stem the terrific current, and would have done so had it not 
 been for the thirty thousand fresh Prussians that pressed on 
 his exhausted ranks. 
 
 7. For a long time these squares stood and let the artillery 
 plough through them. But the fate of Napoleon was writ; 
 and though Ney doubtless did what no other man in the army 
 could have done, the decree could not be reversed. The star 
 that had blazed so brightly over the world went down in blood, 
 and the "bravest of the brave had fought" his last battle. It 
 was worthy of his great name; and the charge of the Old

 The Deacon's Story. 
 
 n. s. emersox. 
 
 i. The solemn old bells in the steeple 
 
 Are ringin'. I guess you know why ! 
 No? Well, then, Til tell you, though mostly 
 
 It's whispered about on the sly. 
 Some six weeks ago, a church meetin' 
 
 Was called — for — nobody knew what ; 
 But we went, and the parson was present, 
 
 And I don't know who, or who not. 
 
 2. Some twenty odd members, I calc'late, 
 
 Which mostly was women, of course; 
 Though I don't mean to say aught ag'in' em, 
 
 I've seen many gatherin's worse. 
 There, in the front row, sat the deacons, 
 
 The eldest was old Deacon Pryor; 
 A man countin' for-score-and-seven, 
 
 And gin'rally full of his ire. 
 
 3. Beside him, his wife, countin' four-score, 
 
 A kind-hearted, motherly soul ; 
 And next to her, young Deacon Hartley, 
 
 A good Christian man on the w^hole. 
 Miss Parsons, a spinster of fifty, 
 
 And long ago laid on the shelf 
 Had wedged herself next ; and, beside her, 
 
 Was Deacon Munroe — that's myself. 
 
 4. The meetin' was soon called to order, 
 
 The parson looked glum as a text; 
 We gazed at each other in silence, 
 
 And silently wonderful "What next?"

 Then slowly uprose Deacon Hartley ; 
 
 His voice seemed to tremble with fear, 
 As he said: "Boy and man you have known me. 
 
 My good friends, for nigh forty year. 
 
 5. "And you scarce may expect a confession 
 
 Of error from me, but — you know, 
 My dearly loved wife died last Christmas, 
 
 It's now nearly ten months ago. 
 The winter went by long and lonely, 
 
 The spring hurried forward apace ; 
 The farm-work came on, and I needed 
 
 A woman about the old place. 
 
 6. "The children were wilder than rabbits, 
 
 And still growing worse every day; 
 No help to be found in the village, 
 
 Although I was willing to pay. 
 In fact, I was nigh 'bout discouraged 
 
 For everything looked so forlorn; 
 When good little Patience McAlpin 
 
 Skipped into our kitchen one morn. 
 
 7. "She had only run in of an errand; 
 
 But she laughed at our miserable plight, 
 And set to work, just like a woman, 
 
 A putting the whole place to right. 
 And though her own folks was so busy, 
 
 And illy her helpin' could spare, 
 She flit in and out like a sparrow, 
 
 And most every day she was there. 
 
 8. "So the summer went by sort of cheerful, 
 
 And one night my baby, my Joe, 
 Seemed feverish and fretful, and woke me, 
 
 By crying, at midnight, you know. 
 I was tired with my day's work, and sleepy, 
 
 And couldn't no way, keep him still, 
 So, at last, I grew angry, and spanked him, 
 
 And then he screamed out with a will.

 9. "Just then I heard a soft rapping 
 
 Away at the half open door; 
 And then little Patience McAlpin 
 
 Walked shyly across the white floor, 
 Says she: T thought Joseph was cryin', 
 
 I guess I'd best take him away: 
 I knew you'd be getting up early, 
 
 To go to the marshes for hay ; 
 So I stayed here to-night to get breakfast ; 
 
 I guess he'll be quiet with me. 
 
 10. " 'Come, Josey, kiss papa, and tell him 
 
 What a nice little man you will be !' 
 She was stooping low 7 over the pillow, 
 
 And saw the big tears on his cheek: 
 Her face was so close to my whiskers, 
 
 I darsn't move, scarcely, or speak; 
 Her hands were both holdin' the baby, 
 
 Her eye by his shoulder was hid; 
 But her mouth was so near and so rosy, 
 
 I — kissed her. That's just what I did." 
 
 11. Then down sat the tremblin' sinner, 
 
 The sisters they murmured of "shame," 
 And "she shouldn't oughter a let him, 
 
 No doubt she was mostly to blame." 
 When straightway uprose Deacon Pryor, 
 
 "Now bretherin and sisters," he said; 
 (We knowed then that suthin' was coming 
 
 And all sot as still as the dead), 
 "You've heard Brother Hartley's confession, 
 
 And I speak for myself when I say 
 That if my wife was dead, and my children 
 
 Were all growin' worse every day; 
 And if my house needed attention, 
 
 And Patience McAlpin had come, 
 And tidied the cluttered up kitchen, 
 
 And made the place seem more like home ; 
 And if I was worn out and sleepy, 
 
 And my baby wouldn't lie still,

 But fretted and woke me at midnight, 
 As babies, we know, sometimes will ; 
 
 And if Patience came in to hush him, 
 And 'twas all as our good brother sez — 
 
 I think, friends — I think I should kiss her, 
 And 'bide by the consequences." 
 
 12. Then down sat the elderly deacon, 
 
 The younger one lifted his face, 
 And a smile rippled over the meetin' 
 
 Like light in a shadowy place. 
 Perhaps, then, the matronly sisters 
 
 Remembered their far-away youth, 
 Or the daughters at home by their firesides, 
 
 Shrined each in her shy, modest truth ; 
 For their judgments grew gentle and kindly, 
 
 And — well — as I started to say 
 The solemn old bells in the steeple 
 
 Are ringing a bridal to-day. 
 
 The Ghost That Jim Saw. 
 
 "Why, as to that," said the engineer, 
 "Ghosts ain't things we are apt to fear, 
 Spirits don't fool with levers much, 
 And throttle valves don't take to such ; 
 And as for Jim — 
 What happened to him 
 Was one half fact and t'other half whim! 
 
 "Running one night on the line, he saw 
 A house — as plain as the moral law — 
 Just by the moonlit bank, and thence 
 Came a drunken man with no more sense 
 Than to drop on the rail, 
 Flat as a flail, 
 As Jim drove by with the midnight mail.

 ''Down went the patents. Steam reversed. 
 Too late! for there came a 'thud' Jim curs-ed,

 And says, 'What now?' 
 Says Jim, 'What now ! 
 I've just run over a man — that's how !' 
 
 "The fireman stared at Jim. They ran 
 Back, but they never saw T house nor man, —

 Occurred, till folks swore Jim was cracked.

 Impeachment of Warren Hastings, 
 edmund burke. 
 
 Lord Macaulay says of this famous speech : "The energy 
 and pathos of the great orator extorted expressions of un- 
 wonted admiration from all; and, for a moment, seemed to 
 pierce even the resolute heart of the defendant. The ladies 
 in the galleries, unaccustomed to such displays of eloquence, 
 excited by the solemnity of the occasion, and perhaps not 
 unwilling to display their taste and sensibility, were in a state 
 of uncontrollable emotion. Handkerchiefs were pulled out; 
 smelling-bottles were handed round ; hysterical sobs and 
 screams were heard, and some were even carried out in fits. 
 At length the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till the old 
 arches of Irish oak resounded, he said : 
 
 i. My Lords, you have now heard the principles on which 
 Mr. Hastings governs the part of Asia subjected to the British 
 Empire. Here he has declared his opinion, that he is a despotic 
 prince; that he is to use arbitrary power; and, of course, all 
 his acts are covered with that shield. "I know," says he, 
 "the Constitution of Asia only from its practice." Will your 
 Lordships submit to hear the corrupt practices of mankind 
 made the principles of Government? 
 
 2. He have arbitrary power! My Lords, the East India 
 Company have not arbitrary power to give him ; the King has 
 no arbitrary power to give him ; your Lordships have not ; nor 
 the Commons ; nor the whole Legislature. We have no ar- 
 bitrary power to give, because arbitrary power is a thing which 
 neither any man can hold nor any man can give. No man can

 lawfully govern himself according to his own will, much less 
 can one person be governed by the will of another. We are 
 all born in subjection, all born equally, high and low, governors 
 and governed, in subjection to one great, immutable, pre-ex- 
 istent law, prior to all our devices, and prior to all our con- 
 trivance-, paramount to all our ideas, and all our sensations, 
 antecedent to our very existence, by which we are knit and 
 connected in the eternal frame of the universe, out of which 
 we cannot stir. 
 
 3. This great law does not arise from our conventions or 
 compacts ; on the contrary, it gives to our conventions and 
 compacts all the force and sanction they can have; — it does 
 not arise from our vain institutions. Every good gift is of 
 God; all pow T er is of God; — and He, who has given the power, 
 and from whom alone it originates, will never suffer the ex- 
 ercise of it to be practiced upon any less solid foundation than 
 the power itself. If then all dominion of man over man is the 
 effect of the divine disposition, it is bound by the eternal laws 
 of Him, that gave it, with w 7 hich no human authority can 
 dispense ; neither he that exercises it, nor even those who are 
 subject to it: and if they w T ere mad enough to make an ex- 
 press compact that should release their magistrate from his 
 duty, and should declare their lives, liberties, and properties 
 dependent upon, not rules and laws, but his mere capricious 
 will, that covenant would be void. 
 
 4. This arbitrary power is not to be had by conquest. Nor 
 can any sovereign have it by succession ; for no man can suc- 
 ceed to fraud, rapine and violence. Those who give and 
 those who receive arbitrary power are alike criminal ; and there 
 is no man but is bound to resist it to the best of his power, 
 wherever it shall show its face to the world. 
 
 5. My Lords, I do not mean to go further than just to re- 
 mind your Lordships of this, — that Mr. Hastings' government 
 was one whole system of oppression, of robbery of individuals, 
 of spoliation of the public, and of supersession of the whole 
 system, of the English Government, in order to vest in the 
 worst of the natives all the power that could possibly exist in 
 any government ; in order to defeat the ends which all govern- 
 ments ought, in common, to have in view 7 . In the name of the 
 Commons of England, I charge all this villainy upon Warren 
 Hastings, in this last moment of my application to you.

 2. Well. Deacon Stokes had gone to bed one night, 
 About eleven or before, 
 
 Twas in December, if my memory's right, in '24. 
 
 Twas cold enough to make a Russian shiver ; 
 
 I think I never knew one 
 
 Colder than this — in faith, it was a blue one ! 
 
 As by the almanac foretold, 'twas 
 
 A real Lapland night. O dear ! how cold 'twas ! 
 
 3. There was a chap about there named Ezekiel, 
 A clever good-for-nothing fellow, 
 
 Who very often used to get quite mellow ; 
 
 Of whbm the Deacon always used to speak ill; 
 
 For he was fond of cracking jokes 
 
 On Deacon Stokes, to show on 
 
 What terms he stood among the women folks, and so on. 
 
 4. It came to pass that on the night I speak of, 
 Ezekiel left the tavern bar-room, where 
 
 He spent the evening, for the sake of 
 
 Drowning his care, by partaking 
 
 Of the merry-making and enjoyment 
 
 Of some good fellows there, whose sole employment 
 
 Was, all kinds of weather, on every night, 
 
 By early candlelight, to get together 
 
 Reading the papers, smoking pipes and chewing, 
 
 Telling long yarns, and pouring down the ruin.

 5. Pretty well corned, and up to anything, 
 Drunk as a lord, and happy as a king, 
 Blue as a razor, from his midnight revel, 
 Xor fearing muskets, women, or the devil ; 
 
 With a light heart — much lighter than a feather — 
 
 With a light soul that spurned the freezing weather, 
 
 And with a head ten times as light as either ; 
 
 And a purse, perhaps, as light as all together, 
 
 On went Ezekiel, with a great expansion 
 
 Of thought, until he brought 
 
 Up at a post before the Deacon's mansion. 
 
 6. With one arm around the post, awhile he stood 
 In thoughtful mood with one eye turned 
 Upward the window where, with feeble glare, 
 A candle burned; 
 
 Then with a serious face, and a grave mysterious 
 Shake of the head, Ezekiel said — 
 (His right eye once more thrown upon the beacon 
 That from the window shone), "I'll start the Deacon !" 
 
 7. Rap, rap, rap, rap, went Deacon Stoke's knocker. 
 But no one stirred ; rap, rap, it went again ; 
 
 "By George, it must be after ten, or 
 They must take an early hour for turning in," 
 Rap, rap, rap — "My conscience, how they keep 
 A fellow waiting — patience, how they sleep !" 
 
 8. The Deacon then began to be alarmed, 
 And in amazement threw up the casement, 
 And with cap on head, of fiery red, 
 Demanded what the cause was of the riot, 
 That thus disturbed his quiet. 
 
 9. "Quite cool this evening. Deacon Stokes," replied 
 
 The voice below. "Well, sir, what is the matter?" 
 "Quite chilly, Deacon ; how your teeth do chatter !" 
 "You vagabond, a pretty time you have chosen 
 
 To show your wit ; for I am almost frozen ; 
 
 Be off, or I will put the lash on !"

 "Why bless you, Deacon, don't be in a passion !" 
 Tvvas all in vain to speak again, 
 For with the Deacon's threat about the lash, 
 Down went the sash. 
 
 10. Rap, rap, rap, rap, the knocker went again, 
 And neither of them was a very light rap; 
 Thump, thump, against the door went Ezekiel's cane, 
 And that once more brought Deacon Stoke's night-cap. 
 
 ii. "Very cold weather, Deacon Stokes, to-night !" 
 
 "Begone, you vile, insolent dog, or I'll 
 Give you a warming that shall serve you right ; 
 You villain, it is time to end the hoax!" 
 
 "Why bless your soul and body. Deacon Stokes, 
 Don't be so cross when I've come here, in this severe 
 Night, which is cold enough to kill a horse, 
 For your advice upon a very difficult and nice 
 Question. Now, bless you, do make haste and dress you," 
 
 12. "Well, well, out with it, if it must be so; 
 Be quick about it; I'm very cold." 
 "Well, Deacon, I don't doubt it, 
 In a few words the matter can be told. 
 Deacon, the case is this : I want to know 
 If this cold weather lasts all summer here — 
 What time will green peas come along next year?"

 A Girl of the Period. 
 
 i. Oh, she was so utterly utter! 
 
 She couldn't eat plain bread and butter, 
 
 But a nibble she'd take 
 
 At a w r afer of cake, 
 Or the wing of a quail for her supper; 
 Roast beef and plum pudding she'd sneer at, 
 A boiled leg of mutton she'd jeer at, 
 
 But the limb of a frog 
 
 Might her appetite jog. 
 Or some delicate bit that came near that. 
 
 2. The consequence was, she grew paler 
 And more wishy-washy, and frailer, 
 
 Ate less for her dinner, 
 
 Grew thinner and thinner, 
 
 Till I really think, 
 
 If you marked her with ink, 
 
 Put an envelope on her. 
 
 And stamped it upon her, 
 You could go to the office and mail her ! 
 
 Her voice was so low and so thrilling, 
 
 Its cadence was perfectly killing ; 
 And she talked with a lisp and a stutter, 
 For she was so utterly utter ! 
 
 3, Oh, she was so very aesthetic!

 Floated loose on the air, 
 And her eyes had a sadness prophetic ;

 The bangs she wore down on her forehead 
 Were straight and deliriously horrid; 
 And a sad-colored gown 
 Going straight up and down 
 She wore when the weather was torrid. 
 
 4. It was terribly hard to enthuse her, 
 But a bit of old china would fuse her; 
 And she'd glow like a coal or a candle, 
 At the mention of Bach or of Handel. 
 At pinks, and sweet-williams and roses, 
 She'd make the most retrousse noses. 
 
 But would swoon with delight 
 
 At a sunflower bright, 
 And use it in making her poses. 
 She moved with the sleepiest motion, 
 As if not quite used to the notion; 
 
 And her manner was chill 
 
 As a water fowl's bill 
 When he's fresh from a clip in the ocean ! 
 It was quite the reverse of magnetic, 
 But oh, it was very aesthetic ! 
 
 5. And if, with your old-fashioned notions, 
 You could wish that more cheerful emotion 
 
 More sunshine and grace, 
 
 Should appear in her face, 
 More gladness should speak in her motions- 
 If you heard with a homesick dejection 
 The changes in voice and inflection, 
 
 And sighed for smooth tresses 
 
 And the plain, simple dresses 
 That used to command your affection. — 
 Oh, hide your rash thoughts in your bosom ! 
 Or if you must speak out and use 'em, 
 Then under your breath you must mutter ; 
 For she is too utterly utter !

 Our Ain Countrie.

 On an afternoon in December little Walter Graham lay pil- 
 lowed in mamma's lap, his life ebbing fast away. The malig- 
 nant croup, that dread disease that cuts short so many little ones 
 and is the terror of all loving mothers, held Wallie fast and 
 tightened its cruel fingers upon Wallie's throat until mamma 
 almost prayed death to claim her darling, that he might be 
 freed from pain. 
 
 Only a short time since the little feet, encased in his first 
 boots, had made noisy but sweet music to mamma's ear, the 
 firm, red cheeks glowed with health, but in a few hours the 
 summons had come for Wallie, the pride and hope of the 
 Graham household. 
 
 After a terrible effort to breathe easier he gasped, "Sing, 
 please, mamma." 
 
 Now mamma knew just what her boy wanted to hear, as 
 no old Christian Scot loved the hymn "My Ain Countrie" 
 more than her boy, but how could the sore-stricken mother 
 sing when she wanted to weep? She began in a queer, shaky 
 voice : 
 
 "I'm far frae my hame an' I'm weary aftenwhiles, 
 
 For the lang'd for hame bringing, an' my father's welcome 
 
 smiles, 
 I'll n'er be fu' content—"

 But he, too, broke down, and Aunt Esther softly sang : 
 
 "His bluid hath made me white an' His hand shall dry 
 
 my een 
 When He brings me hame at last to my ain countries 
 
 Wallie's breathing was now easier, his head dropped lower, 
 his pulse fluttered feebly; he tried to smile even in his pain. 
 
 Then the aged minister, who had known mamma in her 
 girl days, sang in his high, tremulous voice : 
 
 "Like a bairn to its mither, a wee birdie to its nest, 
 I wad fain noo be gangin' unto my Savior's breast. 
 For He gathers in His bosom even witless lambs like me. 
 An' He carries them Himself to His ain countrie." 
 
 Wallie's head sank lower; he lay still, so very still, and 
 then we knew he had gone to his ain countrie. 
 
 The Harvest of Rum.

 I. Streaming down the ages, blighting the rosebuds. 
 shriveling the grasses, scorching the heart, and blistering the 
 soul, has come a lurid tongue of flame which, heated by. the

 dropped over the earth a sea of unutterable woe. In the dark- 
 ness of midnight it has gathered intensity of brightness, and 
 glared about the hearthstones, wet with the weeping of wives, 
 mothers and children, and bronzed the beauty of earth with 
 the horrid cast of hell. Twisting around the altar of the

 church, it has wreathed the sweetest flowers that ever at- 
 tempted to bloom for the adornment of heaven, and has fed 
 death from the very waters of life ; at the very door of heaven 
 itself it has glowed with appalling madness and been almost 
 an impassable wall of flame between misery and bliss. 
 
 2. Dripping burning drops of agony into the tenderest 
 depths of writhing souls, they have wailed and wept and hissed 
 unutterable despair, and pleaded with God to blot them from 
 existence forever. This blighting, glowing, burning, damning 
 curse of the world is the demon Intemperance. Language has 
 never been made that can depict it in all its hideousness. Look 
 on that stack of skeletons that rears its ghastly form — an insult 
 to God — high in the clouds, and shapes the whistling winds 
 into an utterance of withering denunciation of the fiery 
 monster that gnawed and scalded and burned and tore the 
 mangled, bleeding flesh from those bones and tossed them 
 into that revolting pile ! 
 
 3. Come, ye writhing, pleading, suffering souls that were 
 robbed of heaven by this sparkling tempter, and cast the black 
 shadow of your wretchedness upon the faces of the living! 
 Oh, graves, give up your bloated, festering millions, and 
 stretch them, in all their rum-scorched ghastliness, over the 
 plains and mountain-tops ! Come forth, ye torn, haggard and 
 bleeding souls, from the time of Noah until to-night! Hold 
 up your bony, withered skeleton hands, ye countless millions 
 of starved and starving women and children. 
 
 4. Come, all the floods of agonizing tears that scorched 
 as the lurid fires of hell where'er they touched, and boil, and 
 blubber, and foam, and hiss in one vast steaming, seething 
 ocean! Come, death, and hell, and agony, with your harvest, 
 garnered from the still and the brewery, and let us mass them 
 in one black, horrifying portraiture of the damned. And let 
 it tell to the shuddering, trembling souls what language never 
 can.

 The Pawnbroker's Shop,

 1. In my walks through the city I frequently stop 
 To examine the wares in the pawnbroker's shop, 
 For each article here has a story to tell 
 
 Unto all who interpret its voicelessness well. 
 
 These were emblems of friendship and truth long ago, 
 
 But their presence here sorrow and misery show, 
 
 For they tell of estrangements and fond ones grown cold — 
 
 Once the pledges of love, now the pledges of gold. 
 
 2. Let us enter awhile; lady fair, do not fear; 
 
 The great ones of earth in their time have been here; 
 Here have come youth and maid, and the old and the gray ; 
 Here the peer and the pauper have elbow T ed their way ; 
 The exchequers of kings from such shops have been drawn. 
 And the jewels of queens have been given in pawn. 
 Then enter, and if for a while you will stop, 
 I will tell of the wares of the pawnbroker's shop. 
 
 3. • Here's a little gold cross ; 'twas a tremulous hand 
 
 Placed it round her boy's neck ere he left the old land. 
 Though that good mother prayed 'twould a talisman be 
 To the youth in his new home beyond the great sea. 
 Though he clung to it fondly for many a year, 
 For a dollar or two he at last sold it here ; 
 Yet the treasures of earth were the veriest dross 
 When compared to the value he placed on this cross. 
 
 4. Here's a locket of hair, once a bright sunny curl, 
 It was shorn from her locks by a beautiful girl, 
 And she gave it to him whom as life she held dear. 
 While he whispered a tale of fond love in her ear ; 
 Her life's blood that girl would have given to prove 
 The strength, and devotion, and depth of her love. 
 Was love true to the last, till the warm heart grew cold. 
 Or like this, its dear gift, was it bartered for gold?

 Since two knelt in the church, and with this were made one. 
 O, who would not envy the bride in that hour, 
 
 With everything earth could bestow for a dower ! 
 As the groom on her fair finger placed this gold ring, 
 Ah, little he thought time such changes could bring 
 As that here she should come, youth and beauty all fled, 
 And her wedding-ring pawn to get money for bread. 
 
 6. But enough I have sung, and though sad be my lay, 
 Yet a much sadder theme you may find any day, 
 When poverty made them these love-tokens sell ; 
 What matter if honor were not sold as well ! 
 
 If you go through the town you will daily behold 
 Both manhood and maidenhood bartered for gold, 
 And these, till time's ending, forever will stop 
 Unredeemed, if once brought to the pawnbroker's shop.

 With the crimson flash of the log-fire's light, 
 And the soft snow sleeps on the prairie's breast, 
 They gather — the frontier scouts of the West — 
 And, speaking sometimes with bated breath 
 
 Of wars of the border, and deeds of death, 
 They crown their stories of reckless strife 
 With the famous ride of Kit Carson's wife. 
 
 2. For into a Sioux village one day, 
 From Dixon, a hundred miles away, 
 
 A horseman reached the chieftain's tent, 
 Dismounted, staggered and gasped: "Fin sent 
 With sorrowful news from the pale-face town. 
 Kit Carson, the scout, is stricken down, 
 And before he bids farewell to life 
 He would see the face of his Indian wife."

 She uttered only a smothered moan, 
 
 And the scout and the chieftain stood alone. 
 
 4. Her pony snorted ; she grasped his mane, 
 And the fleetest mustang that pressed the plain, 
 Turning away from the sunset light, 
 
 Sped like an arrow into the night, 
 
 And the flanks threw backward a glistening foam, 
 
 As she headed her horse to her husband's home.

 Or of reckless rides in glorious war 
 But, oh ! if ever, perchance, you hear 
 Of Sheridan, Graves or Paul Revere —

 Just speak the name of Kit Carson's wife.

 And the girl looked up as the moon flashed by — 
 The terrified moon, in a terrible race, 
 Keeping time to her pony's pace ! 
 
 She heard the hoot of the lonely owl. 
 
 And afar, from a forest, a dismal howl 
 
 Louder and louder, piercing the air, 
 
 Till her throbbing heart moaned a pitiful prayer, 
 
 For, grasping her pistol and looking back, 
 
 The Indian girl saw wolves on her track.

 And his comrades tearing him part from part, 
 While the horse flashed faster over the plain, 
 With the girl's dark face in his tangled mane, 
 Over the trackless prairies, aw T ay 
 Galloping into the new-born day.

 Riding as fast as the north wind blows, 
 With the flash of the sun on the leader's plume, 
 A signal that sealed the maiden's doom.

 Like flames in a gloomy forest place, 
 Flushed redly into her Indian face, 
 And she caught the tomahawk at her side, 
 A toy in the blood of berries dyed — 
 Swung it aloft, and, with panting breath 
 Galloped full in the front of death.

 Swerved like lightning, bending low ; 
 Thro' the band, that parted to right and left, 
 A clear wide path the maiden cleft, 
 
 And an instant more she had passed them by, 
 And was riding alone into the eastern sky.

 While the sunlight's glory over her hair 
 Shone like a halo, wonderful, grand! 
 
 Had she fled from the far-off spirit-land? 
 Had she brought them blessings, or a blight? 
 They shuddered and broke into sudden flight.

 Into the village riding down, 
 
 With fevered brain, and with glazing eyes, 
 And breath that fluttered with gasping sighs, 
 Still she urged on the faltering steed, 
 That had served her well in her hour of need. 
 And the pony leaped as it felt the rein, 
 Galloped, staggered, and reeled again, 
 And just as it reached Kit Carson's door, 
 With work well done, and with anguish o'er, 
 Fell to the earth and stirred no more !

 And then he stopped awhile 
 To fringe his words the merest mite

 In a face of beauteous mould, 
 Whose liquid eyes were peeping 
 
 From a broidery of gold. 
 
 2. "I've come to ax ye, Biddy, dear,

 As if his heart had bubbled o'er

 His lips were twitching nervously 
 
 O'er what they had to tell, 
 And timed their quavers with the eyes 
 
 That gently rose and fell.

 The throbbing of her heart, 
 That told how love had entered in 
 And claimed its every part.

 With just the faintest sigh.

 An Evangel. 
 
 1. The Lord alone with Peter walked one day 
 Where bright Genesareth in sunshine lay; 
 At that hour, when the sun had fiercest glare, 
 They reached a cottage as they wandered, where, 
 Before a doorway, ruinous and low, 
 
 A fisher's widow sat, in garb of woe, 
 
 Full of sad thoughts. Yet she forebore to weep, 
 
 That she might spin her task and rock her babe to sleep. 
 
 2. Not far away the Lord and Peter stood, 
 Half hidden by a fig-tree in a wood. 
 
 As they looked on unseen, along the road 
 Came an old beggar staggering with a load, 
 An earthen jar poised on his trembling head; 
 He paused before the widow, and he said : 
 "Woman, this milk has to be carried still 
 A half-mile further over yonder hill; 
 But, as you see, exhausted by the heat, 
 I cannot get it to the village street ; 
 And if I find no help, I lose to-day 
 The penny I was promised as my pay."

 3. The widow rose. She neither spoke nor smiled, 
 But dropped her distaff, ceased to lull her child, 
 Raised the tall pitcher slowly on her head, 
 Waived the man on, and followed in his tread. 
 
 4. Then eager Peter spoke: ''Master," he said, 
 ' ' Tis right to succor those who need our aid ; 
 
 But is this woman doing right to fly 
 From house and child to help a passer-by? 
 Doubtless the man need not have travelled far 
 To find some idler who would bear his jar." 
 
 5. Then the Lord looked on Peter: "Be thou sure, 
 Whene'er a poor man helps a man more poor, 
 My Father's care o'er his own home is thrown; 
 She hath done well in that which she has done." 
 
 6. As thus the Lord his servant's zeal restrained, 
 He took the mother's place, and even deigned 
 The distaff with His hands divine to ply, 
 
 And rocked the restless babe, and sang its lullaby. 
 
 7. Then rising when it slept, He waved His hand, 
 And Peter followed at His mute command. 
 When the poor woman reached her cabin bare — 
 A home made rich by God's protecting care — 
 
 She found — but never knew by whom 'twas done — 
 That her baby slept, and that her flax was spun. 
 
 How a Frenchman Entertained John Bull. 
 
 1. In years bygone, before the famous Rockaway Pavilion 
 was built, the Half-Way House, at Jamaica, Long Island, used 
 to be filled with travelers to the sea-shore, who put up there, 
 and visited the beach, either in their own or in hired vehicles, 
 during the day. One warm summer evening, when the house 
 was unusually crowded, an Englishman rode up in a gig and 
 asked for accommodation for the night. The landlord replied 
 that all his rooms were taken, and all his beds, except one,

 which was in a suite of rooms occupied by a French gentle- 
 man. "If you and Monsieur can agree to room together,'' said 
 the landlord, "there is an excellent vacant bed there. " 
 
 2. The traveler replied, "No, I cannot sleep in the same 
 room with any d — Frenchman/' and off he rode with all the 
 grum looks of a real John Bull. 
 
 3. In about half an hour, however, he came back, saying 
 that as he could find no other lodgings, he believed he would 
 have to accept the Frenchman as a room-mate. Meantime his 
 first ill-natured remark had somehow reached the French 
 gentleman's ears, and he resolved to pay off Johnny in his 
 own coin. 
 
 4. On being shown to the apartment, the Englishman 
 stalked in, in his accustomed haughty manner, while the 
 Frenchman, as is usual with his nation, rose and received him 
 with smiles and bows — in short, he was more precisely polite 
 than usual — sarcastically, so a keen observer would have 
 thought. Not a word passed between the two, but soon the 
 Englishman gave a pull at the bell-cord. The Frenchman 
 quietly rose from his seat and gave the string two pulls. On 
 the appearance of the waiter, Bull said : "Waiter, I want 
 supper: order me a beefsteak, and a cup of tea." 
 
 5. The Frenchman instantly said : "Vataire, ordaire two 
 cup tea, and two bif steak; I want two suppaire!" 
 
 6. Bull started and look grum, but said nothing. The 
 Frenchman elevated his eyebrows and took a huge pinch of 
 snuff. When supper was ready, the two sat down and ate for 
 a while in silence, when the Englishman said : 
 
 7. "Waiter, bring me a bottle of Burgundy." 
 
 The waiter started on his errand, but before reaching the 
 door, the Frenchman called to him : "Vataire, come back here ! 
 you bring me two bottle Burgundy." 
 
 8. Bull knit his brows : Monsieur elevated his, shrugged 
 his shoulders, and took another pinch of snuff. The wine was 
 brought, and while quaffing it the Englishman said : 
 
 "Waiter, bring me an apple tart, and a what d'ye call it, 
 there — a Charlotte-de-Russe." 
 
 Monsieur then called to the waiter: "Bring me two of de 
 apple tart, and two vat de diable you call him — Sh-Sh Sharlie- 
 de-Ross."

 9. Bull's patience was now exhausted, and before the last 
 order could be executed, he started from his seat and rang the 
 bell. The Frenchman went to the string and gave it two 
 violent pulls. The waiter (who was almost convulsed with 
 laughter) came hurrying back, when Bull roared out: 
 
 10. "Waiter, never mind the Charlotte-de-Russe ; bring 
 me up a bootjack and a pair of slippers. " 
 
 The Frenchman responded — "Vataire, you no mind to 
 bring two of de Sharlie-de-Ross, but yo bring two slippaire, 
 and two shack-boot." 
 
 ii. Before there was time to bring these articles, Bull had 
 thoroughly lost his temper, and when the waiter appeared with 
 them, he thundered out : 
 
 "Waiter, bring me a candle; and if you have no room in 
 the house with a bed in it besides this, show me a settee, or a 
 lounge, or a couple of chairs, or, in short, any place where 
 I can rest in peace by myself." 
 
 12. Monsieur instantly called out: "Stop, vataire: you 
 sail bring me two candle, and if you have no room with two 
 bed in him, you sail bring me two lounge, two settee, and two 
 chair ! by gar, I vill rest in two pieces !" 
 
 Bull could stand it no longer. He kicked the bootjack out 
 of the way and made a rush for the door, banged his head in 
 an attempt to open it, ran against the waiter at the head of the 
 stairs, when both tumbled to the bottom, darted into the bar- 
 room, paid his bill, and ordered up his horse and gig, swear- 
 ing he would never sleep in the house with a mad Frenchman. 
 
 The South During the Revolution, 
 robert young hayne. 
 
 1. If there be one State in the Union, Mr. President,— 
 and I say it not in a boastful spirit, — that may challenge com- 
 parison with any other for a uniform, zealous, ardent, uncal- 
 culating devotion to the Union, that State is South Carolina. 
 
 2. Sir, from the very commencement of the Revolution, 
 up to this hour, there is no sacrifice, however great, she has 
 not cheerfully made ; no service she has hesitated to perform.

 She has adhered to you, in your prosperity; but, in your ad- 
 versity, she has clung to you, with more than filial affection. 
 
 3. No matter what was the condition of her domestic 
 affairs; though deprived of her resources, divided by parties, or 
 surrounded with difficulties, the call of the country has been to 
 her as the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at the 
 sound ; — every man became at once reconciled to his brethren ; 
 and the sons of Carolina were all seen crowding together to 
 the temple, bringing their gift to the altar of their common 
 country. 
 
 4. What, sir, was the conduct of the South, during the 
 Revolution? Sir, I honor New England for her conduct in 
 that glorious struggle. But great as is the praise which be- 
 longs to her, I think, at least, equal honor is due to the South. 
 They espoused the quarrel of their brethren, with a generous 
 zeal, which did not suffer them to stop to calculate their inter- 
 ests in the dispute. 
 
 5. Favorites of the mother country, possessed of neither 
 ships nor seamen, to create a commercial relationship, they 
 might have found in their situation, a guarantee that their 
 trade would be forever fostered and protected by Great Britain. 
 But, trampling on all consideration, either of interest or of 
 safety, they rush into the conflict; and fighting for principle, 
 periled all in the sacred cause of freedom. 
 
 6. Never were there exhibited in the history of the world, 
 higher examples of noble daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic 
 endurance than by the Whigs of Carolina during the Revolu- 
 tion. The whole State, from the mountains to the sea, was 
 overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy. The fruits 
 of industry perished on the spot where they were produced, or 
 were consumed by the foe. The 'plains of Carolina' drank up 
 the most precious blood of her citizens. Black and smoking 
 ruins marked the places which had been the habitations of her 
 children ! 
 
 7. Driven from their homes into the gloomy and almost 
 impenetrable swamps, — even there the spirit of liberty sur- 
 vived; and South Carolina, sustained by the example of her 
 Sumpters and her Marions, proved by her conduct that though 
 her soil might be overrun, the spirit of her people was 
 invincible !

 Brutus on the Death of Caesar. 
 
 william shakespeare. 
 
 (Admirably adapted for drill in orotund quality.) 
 
 1. Romans, countrymen and lovers! Hear me for my 
 cause; and be silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine 
 honor ; and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe. 
 Censure me in your wisdom ; and awake your senses, that you 
 may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, — any 
 dear friend of Caesar's, — to him I say, that Brutus's love to 
 Caesar was not less than his. 
 
 2. If, then, that friend demand why Brutus rose against 
 Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but 
 that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, 
 and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free- 
 men ? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him ; as he was fortun- 
 ate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but as he 
 was ambitious, I slew him. There are tears for his love, joy 
 for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. 
 
 3. Who is here so base, that would be a bondman? If 
 any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, 
 that would not be Roman? If any, speak; for him have I 
 offended. Who is here so vile, that will not love his country ? 
 If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. 
 
 4. None? Then none have I offended. I have done no 
 more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of 
 his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, 
 wherein he was w r orthy; nor his offenses enforced, for which 
 he suffered death. 
 
 5. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, 
 though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit 
 of his dying, — a place in the commonwealth ; as which of you 
 shall not? With this I depart: — That as I slew my best lover 
 for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, 
 when it shall please my country to need my death.

 Evening at the Farm, 
 j. t. trowbridge. 
 
 1. Over the hill the farm-boy goes, 
 
 His shadow lengthens along the land; 
 A giant staff in a giant hand ; 
 In the poplar-tree, above the spring, 
 The katydid begins to sing ; 
 
 The early dews are falling ; 
 Into the stone-heap darts the mink : 
 The swallows skim the river's brink ; 
 When home to the woodland fly the crows, 
 When over the hill the farm-boy goes, 
 Cheerily calling, 
 
 "Co' boss ! co' boss ! co' ! co' ! co' !" 
 Farther, farther, over the hill, 
 Faintly calling, calling still, 
 
 "Co' boss ! co' boss ! co' ! co 5 ! co' !" 
 
 2. Into the yard the farmer goes 
 
 With grateful heart at the close of day; 
 Harness and chain are hung away ; 
 In the wagon-sheds stands yoke and plow ; 
 The straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow, 
 
 The cooling dews are falling ; 
 The friendly sheep their welcome bleat, 
 The pigs come grunting at his feet, 
 And the whinnying mare her master knows 
 When into the yard the farmer goes, 
 His cattle calling, 
 
 "Co' boss ! co' boss ! co' ! co' ! co' !" 
 While still the cow-boy, far away, 
 Goes seeking those that have gone astray, 
 
 "Co' boss! co'boss!co'! co'! co'!" 
 
 3. Now to her task the milkmaid goes ; 
 
 The cattle come crowding through the gate, 
 Lowing, pushing, little and great; 
 About the trough, by the farm yard pump, 
 The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump, 
 While the pleasant dews are falling;

 The new milch heifer is quick and .shy, 
 But the old cow waits with tranquil eye, 
 And the white stream into the bright pail flows 
 When to her task the milkmaid goes, 
 Soothingly calling, 
 
 "So, boss! so, boss! so! so! so!" 
 The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool, 
 And sits and milks in the twilight cool, 
 
 Saying, "So ! so, boss ! so ! so ?" 
 
 4. To supper at last the farmer goes; 
 The apples are pared, the paper read, 
 The stories are told, then all to bed. 
 Without, the cricket's ceaseless song 
 Makes shrill the silence all night long; 
 The heavy dews are falling ; 
 The housewife's hand has turned the lock; 
 Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock ; 
 The household sinks to deep repose, 
 But still in sleep the farm-boy goes, 
 Singing, calling, 
 
 "Co' boss ! co' boss ! co' ! co' ! go' !" 
 And oft the milkmaid, in her dream, 
 Drums in the pail with the flashing stream, 
 
 Murmuring, "So, bossl so!"

 Never, not even to victory's call !"

 No, may my death be like his when I die ! 
 No regrets wasted on words I am leaving, 
 
 Falling with brave men and face to the sky.

 Fame is eternal, and better than all.

 All the night long he had been on their track, 
 Scorning their traps and the men that had set them, 
 
 Wild for a charge that should never give back. 
 There on the hill-top he halted and saw them, 
 
 Lodges all loosened, and ready to fly. 
 Hurrying scouts, with the tidings to awe them, 
 
 Told of his coming before he was nigh. 
 
 4. All the wide valley was full of their forces, 
 
 Gathered to cover the lodges' retreat, 
 Warriors running in haste to their horses. 
 
 Thousands of enemies close to his feet ! 
 Down in the valleys the ages had hollowed, 
 
 There lay the Sitting Bull's camp for a prey ! 
 Numbers ! What recked he ? What recked those who 
 followed ? 
 
 Men who had fought ten to one ere that day ? 
 
 5. Out swept the squadrons, the fated three hundred, 
 
 Into the battle-line steady and full; 
 Then dow r n the hill-side exultingly thundered, 
 
 Into the hordes of the Old Sitting Bull!

 Over the hill-tops the devils come racing,

 Red was the circle of fire about them : 
 
 No hope of victory, no ray of light, 
 Shot through that terrible black cloud without them, 
 
 Brooding in death over Custer's last fight. 
 
 7. Then, did he blench? Did he die like a craven, 
 
 Begging those torturing fiends for his life? 
 Was there a soldier who carried the Seven 
 Flinched like a coward or fled from the strife?

 No, by the blood of our Custer, no quailing ! 
 
 There in the midst of the devils they close,

 Down go the horses and riders and all ; 
 Swiftly the warriors round them were ringing, 
 
 Circling like buzzards awaiting their fall. 
 See the wild steeds of the mountain and prairie, 
 
 Savage eyes gleaming from forests of mane; 
 Quivering lances with pennons so airy ; 
 
 War-painted warriors charging amain. 
 
 9. Backward again and again they were driven, 
 
 Shrinking to close with the lost little band. 
 Never a cap that had worn the bright Seven 
 
 Bow'd till its wearer was dead on the strand. 
 Closer and closer the death-circle growing, 
 
 Even the leader's voice, clarion clear, 
 Rang out his words of encouragement glowing, 
 "We can but die once, boys, but sell your lives dear \" 
 
 10. Dearly they sold them, like Berserkers raging, 
 
 Facing the death that encircled them round ; 
 Death's bitter pangs by their vengeance assuaging, 
 
 Marking their tracks by their dead on the ground. 
 Comrades, our children shall yet tell their story,

 And ages shall swear that the cup of his glory 
 
 Needed but that death to render it full.

 years old, volunteered to procure the information. He was 
 taken and hanged as a spy the day after his capture, Sept. 22, 
 1776. His patriotic devotion, and brutal treatment received at 
 the hands of his captors, have suggested the following.] 
 
 1. Twas in the year that gave the Xation birth — 
 A time when men esteemed the common good 
 
 As greater weal than private gain. A battle fierce 
 And obstinate had laid a thousand patriots low, 
 And filled the people's hearts with gloom. 
 
 2. Pursued like hunted deer, 
 
 The crippled army fled ; and, yet, amid 
 
 Disaster and defeat, the Nation's chosen chief 
 
 Resolved his losses to retrieve. But not 
 
 With armies disciplined and trained by years 
 
 Of martial service, could he, this Fabian chief, 
 
 Now hope to check the host's of Howe's victorious 
 
 legions — 
 These had he not. 
 
 3. In stratagem the shrewder general 
 Ofttimes o'ercomes his strong antagonist. 
 To Washington a knowledge of the plans, 
 Position, strength of England's force 
 Must compensate for lack of numbers.

 In hand. Lo ! he stands before the chief. In face, 
 A boy — in form, a man on whom the eye could rest 
 In search of God's perfected handiwork, 
 
 In culture, grace, and speech, reflecting all 
 A mother's love could lavish on an only son. 
 
 5. The chieftain's keen discerning eye 
 Appraised the youth at his full worth, and saw 
 In him those blending qualities that make 
 
 The hero and the sage. He fain would save 
 For nobler deeds a man whose presence marked 
 A spirit born to lead.

 "Young man," he said with kindly air, 
 "Your country and commander feel grateful that 
 Such talents are offered in this darkening hour.

 You undertake? Have you, in that fine balance, which

 Your chances of escape 'gainst certain fate 
 Should capture follow in the British camp ?"

 We cannot brush away with words. The ranks

 Perhaps a sacrifice. If God and training in

 This duty to perform, the danger of the enterprise 
 Should not deter me from the act

 Like these a Nation's life sometimes upon 
 A single life depends. If mine be deemed

 Deliverance." 
 
 8. "Enough, go then, at once," the great 
 Commander said: "May Heaven's guardian angels give 
 You safe return. Adieu." 
 
 9. Disguised with care, the hopeful captain crossed 
 The bay, and moved through British camp 
 
 Without discovery by troops or refugees. 
 The enemy's full strength, in men, in stores, 
 Munitions, guns, — all military accoutrements

 Were noted with exact precision ; while 
 With graphic sketch, each trench and parapet, 
 Casemated battery, magazine and every point 
 Strategic, was drawn with artist's skill. 
 
 10. The task complete, the spy with heart 
 Elate, now sought an exit through the lines. 
 
 Well might he feel a soldier's pride. An hour hence 
 A waiting steed would bear him to his friends. 
 His plans he'd lay before his honored chief; 
 His single hand might turn the tide of war — 
 His country yet be free. 
 
 11. "Halt!" a British musket leveled at 
 His head dimmed all the visions of his soul. 
 
 A dash — an aimless shot ; — the spy bore down 
 
 Upon the picket with a blow that else 
 
 Had freed him from his clutch, but for a score 
 
 Of troopers stationed near. In vain the struggle fierce 
 
 And desperate — in vain demands to be released. 
 
 A tory relative, for safety quartered in 
 
 The British camp, would prove his truckling loyalty 
 
 With kinsman's blood. A word — a look — 
 
 A motion of the head, and he who'd dared 
 
 So much in freedom's name was free no more. 
 
 12. O, Judas, self-condemned! thou art 
 But the type of many a trait'rous friend, 
 Who ere and since thy time, betrayed to death 
 A noble heart. Henceforth be doubly doomed — 
 A base example to earth's weaker souls. 
 
 13. Before Lord Howe the captive youth 
 Was led. "Base dog !" the haughty general said, 
 
 "Ignoble son of loyal sires ! you've played the spy 
 Quite well I ween. The cunning skill wherewith 
 You wrought these plans and charts might well adorn 
 An honest man ; but in a rebel's hands they're vile 
 And mischievous. If aught may palliate 
 A traitor's act, attempted in his sovereign's camp. 
 I bid you speak ere I pronounce your sentence."

 14. With tone and mien that hushed 
 The buzzing noise of idle lackeys in the hall, 
 
 The patriot thus replied : "You know my name — 
 
 My rank; — my treach'rous kinsman made 
 
 My purpose plain. I've nothing further of myself 
 
 To tell beyond the charge of traitor to deny. 
 
 The brand of spy I do accept without reproach ; 
 
 But never since I've known the base ingratitude 
 
 Of king to loyal subjects of his realm 
 
 Has British rule been aught to me than barbarous 
 
 Despotism which God and man abhor, and none 
 
 But dastards fear to overthrow. 
 
 15. For tyrant royalty your lordship represents 
 I never breathed a loyal breath; and he 
 
 Who calls me traitor seeks a pretext for a crime 
 His trembling soul might well condemn." 
 
 "I'll hear no more such prating cant," 
 Said Howe, "Your crime's enough to hang a dozen men. 
 Before to-morrow's sun goes down you'll swing 
 'Twixt earth and heaven, that your countrymen 
 May know a British Camp is dangerous ground 
 For prowling spies. Away." 
 
 16. In loathsome cell, deprived 
 
 Of Holy Sacrament, and e'en the word of Him 
 Who cheered the thief upon the cross, — refused 
 The means wherewith he would indite his last 
 Farewell to her who gave him life, 
 And to another whose young heart 
 To-morrow's work would shade in gloom, 
 He passed the night in charge of one whom Satan had 
 Commissioned hell's sharpest torments to inflict. 
 
 17. Securely bound upon a cart, amid 
 
 A speechless crowd, he stands beneath a strong 
 Projecting limb, to which a rope with noose attached, 
 Portends a tragic scene. He casts his eyes 
 Upon the surging multitude. Clearly now 
 His tones ring out as victors shout in triumph:

 18. "Alen, I do not die in vain. 
 
 My humble death upon this tree will light anew 
 The Torch of Liberty. A hundred hands to one 
 Before will strike for country, home and God, 
 And rill our ranks with men of faith in His 
 Eternal plan to make this people free. 
 A million prayers go up this day to free 
 The land from blighting curse of tyrant's rule. 
 Oppression's wrongs have reached Jehovah's throne : 
 The God of vengeance smites the foe ! This land — 
 This glorious land, — is free — is free ! 
 
 "My friends, farewell, in dying thus 
 I feel but one regret ; it is the one poor life 
 I have to give in Freedom's cause."
