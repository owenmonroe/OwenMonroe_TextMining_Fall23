PREFACE. 
 
 The apology which is usually offered for issuing a new book, is, 
 "to supply a long-felt want." It is quite probable, however, that the 
 "want," in most instances, is "long-felt" only by the author himself. 
 It is a legitimate object of an author, to enable others to know what 
 their wants are. Had our most eminent authors waited until there 
 was a popular demand for their works, none of our best books would 
 have ever been written. When the Decalogue was first written on 
 tables of stone, there was no "long-felt want" for a code of morals, 
 yet nothing else was more needed. 
 
 The writer is well aware that bundles of good, bad, and indifferent 
 literature, are already very numerous. He is also aware that these 
 bundles of literature are of but little value to the individual learner, 
 so far as instruction in elocution is concerned. Any work which con- 
 tains a plain, conche and practical system of elocutionary instruction, is 
 of special value ; and it is believed that such works are exceedingly rare. 
 
 Any effort however humble, which is intended to aid the student 
 of elocution, ought to meet with encouragement. For nothing is 
 more apparent than the need of improvement in elocution. Few per- 
 sons read well, and still fewer speak well. Even among teachers the 
 need of elocutionary instruction and discipline is miserably apparent. 
 
 No other branch so imperatively demands to be taught by example. 
 Hence, pupils generally read about as well as their teachers, but no 
 better. Of course, we here speak of the art of elocution. 
 
 The writer appreciates the importance of being able to merely inter- 
 pret the thoughts and feelings of an author, but it is assumed, in the 
 preparation of this work, that to be able to correctly express those 
 thoughts and feelings, is a very desirable accomplishment. It may be 
 further stated that this correct interpretation is the primary requisite 
 or foundation of the correct expression; and there is no certain way 
 of determining what conception one has of the thoughts and feelings 
 of an author, except by rhetorical expression.

4 PREFACE. 
 
 It is assumed that exercises in elocution should secure efficiency in 
 extemporaneous speaking. If this be true, the elocutionist who can 
 not express his own thoughts and feelings well, fails to exemplify in 
 himself, the consistency or merits of his elocutionary instruction. 
 
 While the chapter, entitled "Methods of Class Work," is intended 
 especially for teachers, it is hoped that the general student will not 
 omit it, as he will find in it suggestions, concerning the principles of 
 elocution and methods of self -culture. 
 
 The student will please observe that there are several divisions of 
 the lecture on "Manhood," each of which would answer a good pur- 
 pose as a declamatory exercise. 
 
 The writer is aware that there is much that can be said about the 
 theory of elocution, that is not in this book ; but it was not the inten- 
 tion to confuse the student with a system of hair-splitting disserta- 
 tions, which would avail him nothing in practice. Hence, allusions to 
 such matters as " single falling wave," "double rising wave," "semi- 
 tonic melody," "single and double antithesis," "expulsive radical 
 stress," etc., have been purposely omitted. 
 
 Tables of the elementary sounds are already sufficiently numerous, 
 and none will be found in this work. It may here be remarked that 
 any mere classification of the elementary sounds will avail the student 
 little or nothing in the actual business of elocution. It is not in- 
 tended that this work shall supplant primary readers, dictionaries, 
 and other works on language. It only claims a place in the broad 
 field in which the author presumes to labor. 
 
 Thanks are due Messrs. Wilson, Hinkle & Co., Messrs. Collins & 
 Bko., and Harper & Brothers, for permission to use selections from 
 their copy-right works. 
 
 For some of the incidents with which the lecture is illustrated we 
 are indebted to that excellent work, "Morals and Manners," by Alex. 
 M. Gow, A. M. Also to the works of Rev. Daniel Wise, D. D. All 
 the works of the latter author are real gems. See his "Young Man's 
 Counselor," "Young Lady's Counselor," and "Path of Life." 
 
 The author here records his obligations to D. H. H. Shewmaker, 
 and to Miss Julia Sparr, both of Muncie, Ind., for valuable aid in the 
 preparation of this book. 
 
 If this little work shall be the means of encouraging and aiding those 
 for whom it is intended, the author will have accomplished his object. 
 
 Muncie, Ind., August, 1876.

COMMENDATORY NOTICES 
 
 FROM EDUCATORS AND THE PRESS, 
 
 Prof. Fertich is the best Institute worker of our knowledge. His lecture 
 on " Manhood " is the best thing we ever heard.— E. Myers, County Superin- 
 tendent, Fulton County, Ind. ; T. W. Fields, Principal Kewanna Normal School, 
 Indiana. 
 
 We have no hesitancy in saying that Mr. Fertich is an elocutionist of the 
 first order, and other county Institutes would profit by engaging his services. 
 —Minutes of Hamilton County, Ind., Institute. 
 
 I take great pleasure in certifying to the eminent success that has attended 
 his labors in our Institute. Our teachers pronounce his lecture on " Man- 
 hood," the best they ever heard.— John Carney, Supt., Jennings County, Ind. 
 
 Prof. Fertich's lecture on " Manhood," was highly instructive — display- 
 ing the harmonious blending of sound logic and brilliant elocution. — Albion 
 New Era. 
 
 His instruction has met the universal commendation of teachers and edu- 
 cators throughout the State, and his elocutionary entertainments have been 
 eminently successful. — Muncie Times. 
 
 The entertainment given by Prof. Fertich, at the Opera House, gave uni- 
 versal satisfaction. As the large audience was passing out, we heard several 
 say, " it was excellent."— Elkhart Daily Observer. 
 
 Hartford City, Ind.— Prof. Fertich has given instruction in our Insti- 
 tute in Physiology, Elocution, Writing, Theory and Practice, &c. We do not 
 hesitate in recommending him as an exceptionally good worker. He has dis- 
 played a wonderful ability in adapting his instruction to the wants of our 
 teachers. His manner of presenting his subjects is attractive, energetic and 
 simple. In recommending him, we feel assured that he will give general 
 satisfaction.— Lewis William, County Supt.; John W. Jones, City Supt. 
 
 His work was in every way satisfactory, entertaining and highly instruc- 
 tive. His suggestions " as to how reading should be taught in the common 
 schools," were very practical and much appreciated by the teachers, as I find 
 them following the suggestions given. I think his labors with us will result 
 in much permanent good, and I take pleasure in recommending him to the 
 confidence of the public. — S. K. Bell, County Supt., Jay Co., Ind.

 Prof. W. H. Fertich lias given instruction in our Institute in Elocution, 
 Theory and Practice, and Composition. In all his work he commanded the 
 most earnest and respectful attention of all our teachers and visitors. We 
 were more than pleased with him. He was the means of making our Insti- 
 tute a great success. His entertainment was pronounced better than some of 
 our recent hundred -dollar lectures.— J. H. Ormsby, County Supt., Wells Co., Ind. 
 
 The Elocutionary Entertainment of Prof. Fertich on Saturday evening, 
 was one of the best— if not the very best— occasions of the sort we have ever 
 attended. His recitations were perfect. His personations were true to life. 
 We haven't yet recovered from the hearty laughs of that occasion. He is the 
 best elocutionist in the West, and we are not paid for saying this.— Pendleton 
 Register.

INTRODUCTION.. 
 
 Q if F " reading is the key to all knowledge," its import- 
 ance can not be easily over-estimated. That it is the 
 most important branch of an education, can not admit 
 of a doubt. It is an established custom to regard reading 
 and rhetorical speaking as being very closely related ; and 
 both are often referred to, in the use of the single term, 
 Elocution. There can be no doubt of the existence of this 
 close relation and the reciprocal dependence of the one upon 
 the other. A good reader is generally a good speaker, and 
 a good speaker is generally a good reader. The ability to 
 read well generally precedes the ability to speak well, though 
 these abilities are often simultaneously developed. Henry 
 Clay, that model of modern orators, attributed his success, 
 as a public speaker, to the habit of committing to memory 
 and frequently declaiming the choice productions of the best 
 authors. Whatever we become closely identified with, 
 becomes to some extent a part of us. Hence, when a pupil 
 commits to memory an author's language, the sentiments of 
 the author become, to a greater or less degree, a part of the 
 pupil's character. For example, the pupil who commits to 
 memory a patriotic selection, will develop in himself the 
 sentiment of patriotism. This fact is of serious importance 
 in its relation to the work of the teacher. 
 
 All elocutionary training ought to have a tendency to 
 result in genuine eloquence. All genuine eloquence is a

10 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 true exponent of what is within. In other words, all really 
 eloquent expression has its foundation in the character of 
 the individual. Xow it is desirable that eloquence be used 
 only for good and noble purposes. We conclude, then, that 
 the development of a good character is of primary import- 
 ance in elocutionary training. 
 
 Most authors of elocution have answered only one ques- 
 tion ; viz., of what does good elocution consist ? We think 
 it is a matter of more importance to know what powers are 
 employed in good expression, and how employ them ? The 
 student of elocution has not so much to do w T ith the invest- 
 igation of a theory, as he has with the development of 
 certain powers necessary to correct expression. A good 
 reader or speaker must possess and employ 
 
 1. A clear Conception. 
 
 2. A vivid Imagination. 
 
 3. Real Sympathy. 
 
 4. Good Imitation. 
 
 5. Vocal Pow t er. 
 
 6. Artistic Skill. 
 
 7. Good Judgment. 
 
 While the employment of all these powers will insure 
 success, the absence of any one of them will result at least 
 in a partial failure. The above is a proper basis, we think, 
 for a system of elocutionary instruction. 
 
 The tendency of many teachers of the present day, is to 
 abandon all rules in elocution. Every system of elocution- 
 ary instruction is dismissed by a dignified " Go to Nature 
 for all your rules. " While many such teachers claim to 
 have been " to Nature," I observe that they never get any

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTIOK. 11 
 
 rules. The sum of their elocutionary instruction is em- 
 bodied in their oft-repeated direction, " Be natural, and 
 read as you talk." Those teachers will have made consider- 
 able progress in the right direction when they have learned 
 that a pupil may " be natural " and at the same time be 
 wrong ; for whatever style the pupil has acquired, is most 
 natural to him. If the direction, " Be natural," were 
 consistent in point theory, it is too indefinite to be of any 
 use. If a pupil were trying to solve a difficult problem in 
 arithmetic, it be would more consistent for his teacher to 
 simply direct him to be logical ; for if the pupil would be 
 logical, he would solve the problem. In reading, as in arith- 
 metic, pupils need to be taught in the detail, and assisted in 
 mastering one difficulty at a time. One reason assigned for 
 discarding rules in reading, is there are so many exceptions 
 to them. Why not discard all rules of syntax, because 
 there are exceptions to some of them ? It is thought proper 
 to study the rules of syntax and the exceptions to them ; 
 and it should be so in reading. 
 
 I may be asked if I would have my pupils u read by 
 rule." I might as well be asked if I would have my pupils 
 talk grammatically " by rule." A student acquaints him- 
 self with the rules of syntax, and governs his language by 
 them, until a habit is formed of expressing himself gram- 
 matically, without any thought of rules. The same thing 
 is accomplished, to a greater or less extent, in reading. 
 
 All reputable authors agree in the fact that to secure the 
 right expression, the things first necessary are the right 
 meaning, and the right feeling. The system of rules in this 
 work is intended to aid the student in securing the right 
 meaning, the right feeling, and the right expression. 
 
 It is further claimed that this arrangement of rules is the 
 


## p. 12 (#18) ##############################################

12 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 best form in which to present a system of elocutionary 
 instruction. To discard all rules, then, in elocution, is to 
 discard the germs of elocutionary instruction. 
 
 The student may inquire if he should commit the rules 
 in this book to memory. 
 
 In reply, I have to say that if the task seems too difficult 
 for you to undertake, you may as well lay this book aside, 
 and take up no other of the kind. And as you bid adieu 
 to all your hopes of marked success in elocution, the only 
 consolation I can offer you, is, try to be as happy as you can, 
 in witnessing the superior attainments of others who are 
 willing to labor.

IvIXDS OF LANGUAGE IX ELOCUTION. 
 
 " Language is the expression of ideas by the voice. The 
 inarticulate sounds by which irrational animals express their 
 feelings or their wants. Language is generic, denoting any 
 mode of conveying ideas ; as, the language of the deaf and 
 dumb, etc." — Webster. 
 
 Our observation and experience, coupled with the above 
 authority, leads us to the conclusion that in elocution there 
 are hco kinds of language used; viz., natural language and 
 articulate language. 
 
 Natural language is the expression of ideas and feelings 
 by means of visible signs and inarticulate sounds. It in- 
 cludes gesture, facial expression, laughing, crying, groan- 
 ing, etc. 
 
 Articulate or spoken language is the expression of ideas 
 by means of speech or articulate sounds. 
 
 The importance of natural language in elocution is not 
 generally appreciated by modern teachers. The ancient 
 Greeks and Romans seem to have understood it better than 
 we do. 
 
 " During the reign of Augustus both tragedies and. 
 comedies were acted by pantomime alone. It was perfectly 
 understood by the people, who wept, and laughed, and were 
 excited in everv wav as much as if words had been em- 
 ployed. It seems, indeed, to have worked upon their 
 sympathies more powerfully than words ; for it became 
 necessary, at a subsequent period, to enact a law restraining

14 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 members of the senate from studying the art of pantomime, 
 a practice to which it seems they had resorted in order to 
 give more effect to their speeches before that body. It is 
 surprising, indeed, to see how perfectly persons practiced in 
 the use of gestures can communicate even complicated trains 
 of thought and long series of facts. Good pantomimists will 
 make the plot of a theatrical piece just as intelligible to an 
 audience as if it were developed by dialogue." — Quackenbos. 
 
 " We must agree therefore with the ancients that there is 
 a power in the proper use of gesture that should not be 
 overlooked. For the law has not changed; gesture is as 
 necessary now as in the days of Demosthenes. The sight 
 as well as the ear needs instruction." — Bronson. 
 
 " The Chinese prefer their mode of speaking to the mind 
 through the eye, by means of visible signs, as superior to 
 spoken words addressed to the ear. Indeed, so far do they 
 carry their attachment to this mode of communication, that 
 it is not uncommon there to see men conversing rapidly 
 together by tracing characters in the air." — Fowler. 
 
 It is quite evident that thought, sentiment, and feeling 
 are readily conveyed through the use of natural language 
 alone. 
 
 Very little feeling can be expressed by the use of 
 articulate language alone; but if the natural language is 
 used simultaneously with the articulate language, each is 
 rendered more than doubly forcible and expressive. 
 
 Most modern authors of elocution have made the mistake 
 to consider facial expression and gesture as simply finishing 
 touches in oratory. 
 
 If we notice the little child before it can use spoken lan- 
 guage, w r e observe that it expresses grief, fright, anger, joy, 
 exultation, desire, etc., in the use of facial expressions and 
 


## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 15 
 
 inarticulate language, often accompanied by significant ges- 
 tures. We observe further, that the child, in playing with 
 its companions, makes frequent use of expressive gesticu- 
 lation. 
 
 If we notice an illiterate person engaged in earnest con- 
 versation, we observe that his facial expressions and motions 
 are nearly half of the entire expression. 
 
 If we notice an earnest and effective speaker who holds 
 his listeners chained by his eloquence, we easily observe that 
 his voice alone does not produce all that effect. 
 
 In short, if we propose to be taught by Nature, we are 
 forced to the conclusion that facial expression and gesture 
 are primary elements of expression. In other words, natural 
 language is a foundation principle in elocution. Every 
 student of elocution ought to know that the reader or 
 speaker makes himself felt, only in the degree that his 
 hearers understand and appreciate his means of expression; 
 and he who depends only upon the spoken language to 
 express himself, can seldom be fully understood by all his 
 hearers, while the natural language is universally under- 
 stood and appreciated. Spoken language is not natural, but 
 artificial. "We understand that spoken language was given 
 to the first man and woman, by a direct and special act of 
 the Deity, and afterward acquired by the descendents, from 
 their parents, and so on down to the present. 
 
 God also clothed Adam and Eve, but their descendents 
 were taught to clothe themselves. To say that the business 
 of clothing ourselves is a natural function, would evidently 
 be absurd; but not much more so than to say speech is a 
 natural function. If, as some writers believe, men were 
 originally "a dumb, low herd," and articulate language is 
 an invention of man, then it is all the more an art. 
 


## p. 16 (#22) ##############################################

16 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 Definitions of elocution, similar to the following, are 
 given by several authors. 
 
 " A true elocution is the natural expression, in words, of 
 thoughts, sentiments, and feelings." 
 
 The above is about as consistent as it would be to say, A 
 good bridge is a natural structure made of bricks and 
 lumber, by the use of mason's and carpenter's tools. Upon 
 reflection, it will be evident to the student, that to secure a 
 natural result, Nature must do the work. 
 
 Even natural language, as generally used in reading, 
 declamation, and studied speeches, results in art, because it 
 is voluntarily employed for the accomplishment of a pre- 
 meditated result : but by the untutored child and illiterate 
 adult it is used spontaneously ; and the efficient orator, in 
 the expression of original thought and feeling, makes many 
 expressive gestures and facial expressions of which he is 
 not even conscious. 
 
 To discuss this matter in detail, would not be proper in 
 a work of this kind ; but it is here suggested that there is 
 much said and written about " natural expression in words," 
 which is not consistent in point of fact, or profitable in 
 experience. Let the student think about the matter. 
 


## p. 17 (#23) ##############################################

DEFINITIONS, RULES AXD PRINCIPLES. 
 
 Reading is the interpretation and expression of the 
 thoughts, sentiments, and feelings of an author. 
 
 Sometimes the reader does not express what he interprets, 
 in which ease reading is simply the interpretation of thought, 
 sentiment, and feeling. 
 
 Elocution, as an art, is the expression of thought, senti- 
 ment, and feeling, whether interpreted or original. 
 
 Elocution, as a science, treats of the principles and 
 methods of rhetorical expression. 
 
 PRIMARY REQUISITES. 
 
 Rule I. In order to correctly express the thoughts, senti- 
 ments, and feelings of em author, his language must be so 
 studied as to secure a clear conception of its meaning. 
 
 The importance of this rule can not be over-estimated. 
 Too many pupils are permitted to blunder over language 
 the meaning of which they can not comprehend. The 
 comprehension of an idea is of vital importance to its 
 correct expression. Hence all exercises in articulation, 
 vocal gymnastics, etc., are matters of secondary importance, 
 even in oral reading. 
 
 By accomplishing the purpose indicated in the rule, we 
 secure all that can be secured by silent reading. A clear 
 conception of the thoughts of an author, involves not only 
 


## p. 18 (#24) ##############################################

18 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 a comprehension of the meaning of each word, bat an 
 understanding of the relative importance of the ideas in the 
 connection in which they are used. It also includes an 
 understanding of the conditions and circumstances of what- 
 ever characters may be alluded to by the author. 
 
 These conditions and circumstances are not always 
 definitely expressed, but must often be inferred from the 
 language used. 
 
 To carefully study the language of an author, requires 
 investigation, close application, and reflection. To suppose 
 that a reading lesson can be more easily prepared than any 
 other lesson, is a common error and a very pernicious one. 
 
 Rule II. In the correct expression of thought, sentiment, 
 and feeling, the reader or speaker must frequently employ his 
 imagination. 
 
 The employment of the imagination is especially necessary 
 in reading colloquial selections and pieces describing past 
 events as present. In many instances, the reader is expected, 
 in a certain sense, to bring the past into the present. He is 
 expected to express the thoughts, sentiments, and feelings 
 of persons of a different sex, age, and character from 
 himself; and the more nearly he can imagine himself to be 
 in the place, condition, and circumstances of the person 
 whose language he uses, the better he will read. By the 
 exercise of his imagination, an eloquent speaker will not only 
 present to his hearers the scenes of the past, but will actually 
 bring into the present, ideal scenes of the future. Many 
 persons seem to possess but very little imaginative power. 
 
 A careful study of history, astronomy, and the Bible, is 
 well calculated to develop a vivid imagination.

 Rule III. The reader should enter into full sympathy with 
 the ideas and feelings of the author, and, if possible, adopt 
 them as his own. 
 
 The purpose indicated in this rule is tersely expressed in 
 the scriptural injunction, "Rejoice with them that rejoice and 
 weep with them that weep" The reader or speaker needs the 
 power to enter readily into sympathy with the joys, hopes, 
 fears, and sorrows to which mankind are subject. 
 
 The young man who can take pleasure in frightening an 
 innocent child ; who can witness it shed tears of sorrow, 
 and feel no pity for it, lacks one of the important requisites 
 which enables one to suitably express the best thoughts of 
 the human mind. 
 
 The individual who can see even poor brutes worry and 
 mangle each other ; and can hear their cries of rage and 
 distress, without any feeling save of satisfaction, need not 
 hope to accomplish much, as a reader or speaker, until he 
 has awakened and developed his moral sensibilities. It is a 
 significant fact that the eminent orators of ancient, as well 
 as those of modern times, were men of deep feeling and 
 rare sympathy. 
 
 Dr. Blair says : " A true orator ( and we may add a good 
 reader ) should be a person of generous sentiments, of warm 
 feelings, and a mind turned toward the admiration of all 
 those great and high objects which mankind are naturally 
 forced to admire. Joined with the manly virtues, he should 
 at the same time possess strong and tender sensibility to all 
 the injuries, distresses and sorrows of his fellow creatures ; 
 a heart that can readily enter into the circumstances of 
 others, and make their case his own." 
 
 To the above we subscribe our hearty indorsment, and

 commend it to the careful attention of the student. We 
 would not urge upon the student the importance of giving 
 attention to moral culture simply as a means of acquiring 
 proficiency in reading and speaking ; he ought to have a 
 higher motive. Yet we are quite sure that real sympathy is 
 an essential element of power in good elocution. 
 
 Rule IV. In giving correct expression to the thoughts 
 and sentiments of others, it is often necessary for the reader to 
 sacrifice his own individuality. 
 
 When the reader proposes to express the ideas and 
 sentiments of persons essentially different from himself; 
 and in the expression of comical ideas, a very important 
 power to be employed, is imitation. In the expression of 
 ideas belonging only to comedy, there is no employment of 
 the power of sympathy in the sense in w r hich it is used in 
 the preceding rule. The reader may expect to succeed in 
 this in proportion, mainly, to his ability to bring into use 
 the powers of imagination and imitation. If a pupil 
 proposes to express ideas agreeable to his own age and 
 character, and if he is able to talk well, then the direction 
 " read as you talk " is consistent. Otherwise it is not. 
 
 In the reading of pathetic pieces, in which the language 
 of different persons is to be expressed, the principle of this 
 rule is sometimes illustrated. 
 
 In representing the foibles, mannerisms, and ludicrous 
 peculiarities of other persons, the reader can not, in every 
 sense, be himself. 
 
 The principal barrier in the way of many students of 
 elocution, is a lack of the ability to sacrifice their individu- 
 ality and assume the character of another.

 Rule V. The position of the body, the muscular move- 
 ments, and facial expressions of the reader or speaker, should 
 correspond to his voccd expressions. 
 
 Gesture and facial expression are each a part of the 
 means by which we convey and impress thought and feeling ; 
 that is, they are each a pjctrt of the entire expression. 
 
 To attempt to express anger, grief, and joy, in a single 
 discourse, without any change in the expression of the 
 countenance, would evidently be absurd. Lloyd appreciated 
 the relative importance of facial expression in elocution, 
 when he said : 
 
 " A single look more marks the internal woe, 
 Than all the windings of the lengthened Oh ! " 
 
 Each gesture should be made when the word demanding 
 it, is uttered. If one is too soon or too late in making a 
 gesture, it were better not to make it. 
 
 The reader or speaker should always look in the same 
 general direction in which he extends his hands and arms. 
 For progress in voice culture, and improvement in gesture, 
 calisthenic exercises are of great utility. 
 
 The objects to be accomplished by such exercises, are a 
 graceful management of the whole person, and strength of 
 the respiratory and vocal organs. 
 
 Calisthenics and gesture can not be taught on paper. 
 Each requires the presence and example of the living 
 teacher. 
 
 ARTICULATION. 
 
 First in order and importance in vocal expression, is a 
 good articulation. 
 


## p. 22 (#28) ##############################################

22 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 Rule VI. It is necessary to give to each syllable its full, 
 distinct, and agreeable utterance. 
 
 Almost any sentence is a suitable exercise in articulation. 
 Care, in the pronunciation of words used in every-day 
 conversation, is of more importance than occasional drills 
 on the elementary sounds. It is important to practice up- 
 on difficult combinations for the development of power and 
 skill in pronunciation.* 
 
 EMPHASIS. 
 
 Emphasis is a special stress of voice placed upon a word, 
 phrase, or clause. The object of emphasis, is to attach 
 particular significance to certain expressions, on account of 
 their relative importance. Emphasis, as an element of 
 vocal expression, is second in order and importance. It 
 should be remembered that emphasis, when properly 
 applied, not only gives" force and elegance to vocal expres- 
 sion, but the meaning of what we say is often dependent 
 upon it. 
 
 Example: " John said that Mr. Harper rejoiced when 
 President Lincoln w r as assassinated." To emphasize 
 " John," would indicate that it was John who said it, and 
 not James or some other person. To emphasize " said," 
 would indicate that John said so, whether it is true or not. 
 To emphasize " Harper," would indicate the particular 
 man that rejoiced. To emphasize " rejoiced," would indi- 
 cate what Mr. Harper did. To emphasize " President," 
 would indicate a particular Lincoln. To emphasize 
 " Lincoln," would indicate a particular President. To em-

 and 7th. 
 


## p. 23 (#29) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 23 
 
 phasize " assassinated/' would indicate a particular time in 
 the history of Mr. Lincoln. 
 
 Thus we see that the expression used is susceptible of at 
 least eight different significations, by changing the seat of 
 emphasis. 
 
 Rule VII. Words representing the principal or leading 
 ideas, or those upon ichich the meaning mainly depends, 
 require emphasis. 
 
 Examples: 1. " Let us, therefore, follow after the things 
 which make for peace ; the things wherewith one may edify 
 another." 2. " Whenever you fail in your attempts to do any 
 good thing, let your motto be, try again" 3. "Let all things 
 be done decently and in order" 4. " The habits of an old 
 man are rarely improved. Youth is the time to accustom 
 both mind and body to right methods of life." 5. "Are you 
 therefore to write yourself a nothing, and remain a cipher 
 in society?" 
 
 Rule VIII. Words, phrases, and clauses, expressing 
 ideas of importance, command, or passion of any kind, require 
 emphasis. 
 
 Examples: 1. "Do you aspire to rival great names? Are 
 you ambitious of high success in life ? Then diligently cul- 
 tivate your intellect." 2. " Whatever thy hand findeth to 
 do, do it with thy might" 3. "And of this be assured, I 
 speak from observation a certain truth : There is no excel- 
 lence without great labor" 4. " Oh, speak, speak, said Ag- 
 nes !" 5. " Stand back and do not meddle, or I'll strike you." 
 
 6. " Willie ! oh, Willie ! it seems but a day, 
 Since thy baby head on my bosom lay."

 7. "Impossible!" cried the Emperor, with indignation; 
 "impossible is the adjective of fools." 8. " Glorious bird ! I 
 will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will never forget, 
 hereafter, that when the spirit is determined, it can do almost 
 any thing. I will set my mark high. I will try to do 
 something and to be something in the world. I ivill never 
 yield to discouragements" 
 
 A word introducing an idea, though seemingly unim- 
 portant, should be appropriately emphasized ; and if the 
 idea is repeated soon in the same discourse, the w T ord 
 representing it will generally not require emphasis. 
 
 Examples : I. "At first we were all much surprised to see a 
 table moving about the room ; but in a moment we discov- 
 ered that a monkey was under it. Now my cousin Emily, 
 who had never seen a monkey, and knew nothing of the 
 monkey character, did not know what to think of the affair." 
 2. "After some conversation, and making himself quite 
 agreeable, he proposed to the miller to change clothes with 
 him. As the judge had a very good suit on, the man had 
 no reason to object." In the last example, the proposition 
 " to change clothes," suggests the idea of " suit," but "good" 
 introduces the idea of quality. Hence, the emphasis as 
 indicated. 
 
 INFLECTION. 
 
 Inflection is a slide of the voice, either upward or down- 
 ward, on a single word. 
 
 Rule IX. Emphatic words, and words denoting a com- 
 pletion of the sense, generally require the falling inflection. 
 
 Examples: 1. Stand y to your guns^; donV waste your 
 


## p. 25 (#31) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 25 
 
 ammunition*; see* that every shot tells*. 2. A retreat* was 
 ordered*, and before dawn the whole army had disappeared. 
 3. Their loss was estimated at 150*, while the Americans 
 had but one killed and seven wounded. 
 
 4. Tell me I hate y the bowl ? 
 Hate is a feeble* word : 
 I loathe* — abhor* — my very soul* 
 With strong disgust is stirred, 
 When'er I see*, or hear*, or tell* 
 Of the' dark beverage of hell*. 
 
 Rule X. Words concluding negations and direct questions, 
 or words used by way of direct address, require the rising 
 inflection ; but if repeated emphatically, the falling inflection 
 is proper. 
 
 Examples: 1. He is not the man'. 2. Will you help 
 me labor'? 3. Boys', bring in some w r ood. If these ex- 
 amples are repeated, we have, 1. He is not the rnan*. 2. 
 Will you help me fa&or*? 3. Boys*, bring in some wood. 
 There may be an exception to the preceding rule, in the 
 case of a formal address ; as, " Mr. President*, Ladies', and 
 Gentlemen*," though such exception is of doubtful pro- 
 priety. 
 
 Rule XL Words concluding indirect questions, require 
 the falling inflection; but if repeated emphatically, the rising 
 inflection is proper. 
 
 Examples: 1. When will you go to the city*? 2. Who 
 paid you for your work* ? If these examples are repeated, 
 


## p. 26 (#32) ##############################################

26 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 we have, 1. When will you go to the city'? 2. Who paid 
 you for your work'? 
 
 If a person is addressed and does not understand what is 
 said to him, he concludes the indirect question with the 
 rising inflection, when first using it ; as, What did you 
 say' ? 
 
 Answers to questions sometimes receive the rising inflec- 
 tion, and sometimes the falling inflection. No rule of 
 importance in regard to them can be deduced. If care is 
 observed in the use of the conversational tone, there will be 
 but little difficulty in securing the appropriate inflection. 
 
 SERIES. 
 
 A series is a succession of particulars in a discourse. 
 
 A series in the beginning or middle of a sentence is called 
 a commencing series. A series which concludes a sentence 
 is called a concluding series. 
 
 Rule XII. Each member of a commencing series gener- 
 ally requires the falling inflection, except the last, which should 
 have the rising inflection. 
 
 Examples: 1. Blasphemy \ falsehood^, cheating^, drunken- 
 ness^, quarreling^ and murder', are all naturally connected 
 with gambling. 2. But behold now, the smitten^ enfeebled^ 
 inflamed^ debauched^, idle y , poor\ irreligious^ and vicious', 
 with halting step, dragging onward to meet an early grave. 
 3. Neither the seductions of love r , the shouts of caution^ 
 the voices of fear\ nor the aspects of danger', tempted him 
 for a moment to relinquish his noble purpose. 
 


## p. 27 (#33) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 27 
 
 Rule XIII. Each member of a concluding series gener- 
 ally requires the falling inflection, except the last but one, 
 which should have the rising inflection. 
 
 Examples : 1. He is generous*, just*, charitable', and 
 humane*. 2. 'We should strive to acquire a pleasant voice*, 
 a good temper*, a chaste manner*, a lofty patriotism', and a 
 love of the beautiful*. 3. How often do men meet in good 
 humor*, then drink to excess*, talk nonsense*, fancy them- 
 selves insulted*, take fire within*, rave*, threaten', and then 
 come to blows*. 
 
 There is quite a difference of opinion among authors in 
 regard to the inflections belonging to the members of a 
 series; and the difficulty of deducing consistent rules in 
 regard to the matter is here admitted. It is believed, 
 however, that the preceding rules are in keeping with the 
 custom of a majority of our best speakers. A commencing 
 series, of which each member is only one word, and not at 
 all emphatic, may be read without giving any distinctly 
 perceptible inflection upon any member ; as, Industry, 
 intelligence, integrity, and charity, constitute an exalted 
 character : or, the falling inflection may be given on the 
 last member only. When such a series concludes a 
 sentence, and each member is necessary to complete the 
 sense, the falling inflection may be given upon the last 
 member only ; as, An exalted character consists of industry, 
 intelligence, integrity, and charity*. 
 
 TIME. 
 
 Time is a measure of the rate of expression. 
 
 It will be sufficient to consider the three principal rates, 
 


## p. 28 (#34) ##############################################

28 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 which will suggest their modifications. Different kinds of 
 discourse require moderate time, slow time, or fast time. 
 
 Rule XIV. Language used in simple narration and 
 description, or in the expression of didactic thought, requires 
 moderate time. 
 
 Examples: 1. To be a lady or a gentleman is a high 
 distinction, and worthy the study of every one who pos- 
 sesses an honorable ambition. Counterfeit gentlemen and 
 ladies are as common as counterfeit money ; if there were 
 no value in good currency, nobody would take pains to 
 imitate it ; so, if there were no real men, gentle-men, there 
 would be no shams. 
 
 2. In an address delivered at Birmingham, England,. Mr 
 Charles Dickens, the eminent author, announced what he 
 considered the secret of his great success in a single wo'f d ; 
 Attention! With him it became an intellectual habit. He 
 declared it to be, " The one serviceable, safe, certain, 
 remunerative, attainable quality in every study and every 
 pursuit." 
 
 Rule XV. Language intended to express ideas of sublim,- 
 ity, grief, or strong feeling of an exalted character, generally 
 requires slow time. 
 
 Examples: 1. The heavens declare the glory of God; and 
 the firmament showeth his handiwork. Hear, O Lord, 
 when I cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me, and 
 answer me. Let the words of my mouth, and the medita- 
 tion of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my 
 strength and my Redeemer.

 2. What a piece of work is man ! How noble in reason ! 
 How infinite in faculties ! In form and moving how ex- 
 press and admirable ! In action how like an angel ! In 
 apprehension how like a God ! 
 
 3. Oh, how I wish I had been there! How eagerly I 
 would have listened to his words of wisdom ! How 
 delightful to have witnessed his simplicity of manner ! And 
 O, to have received a blessing from his immaculate lips ! 
 
 Rule XVI. Language intended to express anger, con- 
 tempt, defiance, alarm, joy, and animation, generally demands 
 fast time. 
 
 Examples: 1. Then who is he that dares to profane the 
 sanctity of these emotions by indulging, in his presence, in 
 vile and villainous oaths ! 
 
 2. I loathe you with my bosom ! I scorn you with mine eye ! 
 I'll taunt you with my latest breath, and fight you till 
 I die. * 
 
 3. Say, don't you see this demon fierce ! 
 
 Does no one hear ? Will no* one come ? 
 Oh save me — save me — I will give — 
 But give me rum ; I will have rum. 
 
 4. And, Douglas, more I tell thee here, 
 
 Even in thy pitch of pride, 
 Here in thy hold, thy vassals near, 
 
 I tell thee thou'rt defied! 
 And if thou saidst I'm not peer 
 
 To any lord in Scotland here, 
 Lowland or Highland, far or near, 
 
 Lord Angus, thou hast lied !

30 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 It will be observed that the preceding rules in regard to 
 time include both rate of utterance and the rate of move- 
 ment in gesture. Since the rate of utterance and the rate of 
 movement in gesture should correspond to each other, it is 
 proper to consider them in the same connection. 
 
 FORCE. 
 
 Force is the degree of energy with which sounds are uttered. 
 
 Emphasis differs from force, in the fact that the former is 
 relative, while the latter is absolute. A whole discourse 
 may be uttered with great force, and • with very little 
 emphasis. The student should avoid confounding force 
 with loudness. Great force may be applied to a whisper as 
 well as a shout. 
 
 The three principal degrees of force may be denominated 
 moderate, gentle, and strong. The different degrees of force 
 generally correspond to the rates of expression : that is, 
 the kinds of discourse requiring moderate time, will require 
 a moderate degree of force ; the kinds of discourse requiring 
 slow time, will require a gentle degree of force ; and the 
 kinds of discourse requiring fast time, will require a strong 
 degree of force. 
 
 Rule XVII. In the use of expressions demanding special 
 force, or a loud and explosive tone, the reader or speaker 
 should judiciously inflate the lungs. 
 
 Examples : 
 
 1. While thronged the citizens with terror dumb, 
 Or whispering with white lips — "The foe! They 
 come ! They come ! " 
 


## p. 31 (#37) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 31 
 
 2. And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before. 
 
 Arm ! arm ! it is — it is the cannon's opening roar ! 
 
 In reading the above examples, the breath should be 
 taken at least three times in the first and seven times in the 
 second. See also examples under the preceding rule. 
 Good breathing is of general importance to the reader or 
 speaker, but it demands special attention in the cases 
 referred to in the rule. 
 
 The principal defect in breathing, is failing to keep the 
 lungs sufficiently well inflated. If one attempt to utter a 
 forcible or explosive sound, with very little air in the lungs, 
 the result is a comparatively weak tone, and fatigue of the 
 respiratory organs. It is better to form the habit of breath- 
 ing mainly through the nostrils. Let the student be sure 
 that he know T s how to breathe properly. 
 
 PITCH, TRANSITION, AND COMPASS 
 
 Pitch is the degree of elevation or depression of the 
 voice. 
 
 The voice should most frequently dwell upon a medium 
 pitch. 
 
 This medium pitch is often called the key-note. 
 
 Transition is change in the manner of expression. 
 
 Transitions are gradual or sudden. 
 
 The Compass of the voice is the range of the voice, both 
 above and below the key-note. 
 
 Rule XVIII. The reader or speaker should generally 
 choose a medium pitch, in order that transitions can be made 
 both to a higher and lower pitch. 
 
 In reading it is common to choose a pitch too low. This 
 


## p. 32 (#38) ##############################################

32 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 does not give sufficient room to change to a lower pitch and 
 be distinctly heard. 
 
 In speaking it is common to dwell too long upon a high 
 pitch; and in doing so, the speaker labors under a very 
 great disadvantage. Emphasis is sometimes attended by an 
 elevation of the pitch, and always by an increase of force. 
 Hence, if one is speaking in a very high pitch, and wishes 
 to emphasize an important word, phrase, or clause, he has 
 not sufficient room or power in reserve to do so. In other 
 words, he who dwells too long upon a very high pitch, robs 
 himself of nearly all the benefit there is in the use of 
 emphasis. 
 
 Rule XIX. Parenthetical expressions demand a lower 
 pitch, and faster time thoM the parts of discourse with which 
 they are used. 
 
 Examples: 1. There is, undoubtedly, something wrong 
 with the man. 
 
 2. I shall, in the mean time, consider your proposition. 
 
 3. There is, it must be admitted, something attractive in 
 such dreamy speculations. 
 
 4. Thompson, who was blessed, with a strong and copious 
 fancy, drew his images from Nature itself. 
 
 5. One day, after having received his highest honors, he 
 was sitting and reading in his parlor. 
 
 6. The blow, if blow it might be called, caught the 
 attention of his aged mother, who now, with some effort, 
 rose from her seat, and tottered across the room. 
 
 7. Words, says one, referring to articulation, should be 
 delivered out from the lips, as beautiful coins, newly issued 
 from the mint. 
 


## p. 33 (#39) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 33 
 
 8. And the common faults in articulation, it should be 
 remembered, take their rise from the very nursery. You 
 mav, therefore, begin the work of forming the orator with 
 your child. 
 
 9. Every star, as we may infer from indisputable facts, 
 is the center of a planetary system. 
 
 10. The doctrine of the immortality of the soul and a 
 system of future rewards and punishments, was taught 
 explicitly ( at least as explicitly as could be expected of an 
 ancient philosopher ) by Socrates. 
 
 Since most parenthetical expressions are set off by com- 
 mas, they can be distinguished, in most cases, only by the 
 general sense of the passages in which they occur. To read 
 such passages without any transitions in pitch or time, is a 
 childish fault, though not always confined to children. 
 
 MONOTONE. 
 
 The monotone is an unvaried tone throughout a sentence 
 or discourse. 
 
 Monotony is a frequent occurrence of the same tone or 
 manner, without reference to the sense. 
 
 A proximate monotone is suited to the expression of 
 sublime and solemn thought. There is certainly no dis- 
 course, and probably no sentence that should ever be 
 expressed in a perfect monotone. The dull uniformity or 
 monotonous style in which the Scriptures and sacred songs 
 are often read, is not in keeping with good taste or good 
 sense. Xo affected manner or peculiarly holy (?) tone is 
 suitable in reading the Scriptures, or in teaching and 
 preaching the truths they express. Like other compositions

34 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 and kinds of discourse, the meaning and sentiment should 
 dictate the manner of the expression. 
 
 MODULATION, STYLE, AND PERSONATION. 
 
 Modulation is the variation of the voice in the expression j 
 of different thoughts, sentiments and feelings. It includes 
 emphasis, inflection, pitch, compass, time, force, and all 
 qualities of voice. A good modulation constitutes the 
 whole secret of success in vocal expression. It is important 
 to remember that 
 
 " 'Tis not enough the voice be sound and clear, 
 'Tis modulation that must charm the ear." 
 
 Some authors use the terms, transition and modulation 
 synonomously. The student should understand that the 
 former is much more comprehensive than the latter : transi- 
 tion includes all changes in vocal expression, facial expres- 
 sion, and gesture. While a; Tis modulation that must 
 charm the ear" it is the correct and graceful management 
 of the whole person " that must charm " the eye. The 
 different tones of voice and kinds of style necessary to the 
 correct expression of different ideas and passions, can not 
 be successfully indicated or illustrated, except by the living 
 teacher. 
 
 Personation is the representation of the tones and manner 
 of other persons. It will be observed that Rules 2nd, 3rd, 
 4th, and 5th, include principles which constitute the prim- 
 ary requisites of personation. The application of these 
 principles, together with vocal power and skill, enables one 
 to personate the character of another. 
 


## p. 35 (#41) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 35 
 
 Rule XX. The tones of the voice and manner of the 
 reader or speaker should be in harmony with the thought, 
 sentiment, and feeling to be expressed. 
 
 To accomplish the purpose indicated in this rule, the 
 reader or speaker must possess a good judgment; since the 
 purpose of the rule includes the application of all the 
 principles of good elocution. Indeed, the study of elocu- 
 tion is particularly the study of common sense. Let the 
 student, therefore, take courage and persevere; remembering 
 that 
 
 " He who in earnest studies o'er his part, 
 Will find true Nature cling about his heart." 
 


## p. 36 (#42) ##############################################

CAUTIONS. 
 
 Caution I. Avoid mistaking rant amd roar for good, 
 elocution. 
 
 Some professional elocutionists make a special hobby of 
 such passages as express anger, excitement, command, 
 horror, etc.; and by their example and teaching lead the 
 student to suppose that the more noise he makes, the better 
 he is succeeding. It is important to know, in the beginning, 
 that there is a vast difference between noise and good ex- 
 pression. A peculiarly coarse and thundering tone of voice 
 is not essential in good elocution. 
 
 Caution II. Avoid depending only upon the voice for 
 correct and effective expression. 
 
 Whatever results may be accomplished by vocal culture, 
 it must be admitted that there are many voices naturally 
 weak and disagreeable, which can be brought to a tolerable 
 condition, only by systematic and long-continued training. 
 While, on the other hand, there is not so much difference in 
 the natural ability to give expression to thought and feeling 
 by visible signs. 
 
 It is a fact worthy of consideration that appropriate 
 facial expressions and suitable gestures actually supply 
 deficiencies in speech. 
 
 It is said that " the man who can speak two languages 
 


## p. 37 (#43) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 37 
 
 with ease, possesses the power of two men." It is equally 
 true that he who can use the natural and the spoken lan- 
 guages with grace and fluency, possesses twice the power of 
 one who depends only upon speech for expression. 
 
 Caution III. Avoid all irrelevant deportment and im- 
 proper gestures. 
 
 Under this head may be mentioned several common 
 fiuilts: 
 
 1. Arranging a watch and papers with great ceremony 
 before commencing to speak. 
 
 2. Jerking the coat into place or arranging any other 
 article of apparel. 
 
 3. Supporting the elbows on a desk or table. 
 
 4. Pulling at a watch chain or fumbling a paper to keep 
 the hands busy. 
 
 5. Standing like a wax figure with legs like perpendicular 
 parallel lines and arms to match. 
 
 6. Making a display of a handkerchief and the manner 
 of cleaning the nose. 
 
 7. Working the arms with such spasmodic jerks as to 
 suggest internal wires and cog-wheels worked by crank. 
 
 8. Tossing the body up and down as though it were sup- 
 ported by a spiral spring. 
 
 9. Rocking to and fro from heel to toe. 
 
 10. Passing about on the platform like a caged panther. 
 All such deportment is very significant, but not relevant 
 
 to the occasion nor respectful to an audience. Every move- 
 ment must have its origin in the thought and feeling to be 
 expressed, or it will be out of place. A simple narrative or 
 unimpassioned style of discourse can not be changed to a

 dramatic character by any amount of flourishing or violent 
 gesticulation. " Suit the action to the word, the word to 
 the action." 
 
 Caution IV. Avoid the omission or incorrect utterance 
 of unaccented vowels. 
 
 Examples: Usu'l or usuul for usual; sat'n or satun for 
 satin ; hund'rd or hundrid for hundred ; creater for creator ; 
 husbund for husband ; systum for system; perpendicular or 
 perpendiculur for perpendicular; fig'r for figure; elemunt 
 for element; acter for actor; uppermust for uppermost; 
 family for family ; differunce for difference ; reg'lur or reg- 
 ulur for regular ; solitood for solitude ; dooty for duty ; 
 gratitood for gratitude ; institoot for institute. 
 
 In the correct utterance of unaccented vowels, avoid er- 
 ring in the opposite extreme, by giving the vowel too much 
 prominence or accenting the wrong syllable. 
 
 Caution V. Avoid the omission of terminating conso- 
 nants or their connection with different words. 
 
 Examples : Singin for singing ; buyin for buying ; fis for 
 fists ; ban for band ; He enlis tis interests sin money, for He 
 enlists his interests in money ; He rest sis beas still night, 
 for He rests his beasts till night. 
 
 Caution VI. Avoid provincial forms of pronunciation 
 for which there is no standard authority. 
 
 In many sections of our country, the consonent r is sel- 
 dom correctly uttered, while a common dandyism is to omit 
 it or substitute h in its stead.

 Example : Ourr childrun utterr theirr worrds betterr than 
 forrmerrly, or Ouh childen uttah theih wods bettah than 
 fomly, for Our children utter their words better than form- 
 erly. 
 
 Few persons pronounce correctly such words as grass, 
 pass, graft, fast, etc. The uneducated usually utter the 
 vowel in this class of words the same as that heard in lamb, 
 ham, etc. A few others give the broad Italian a. Both 
 are wrong. The proper vowel sound in these words is the 
 short Italian a. (See Webster.) It is certainly unfortunate 
 that a preponderance of authority favors the use of the 
 broad Italian a in such words as half, calf, laugh, calm, 
 psalm, etc. Good taste and the tendency of our best speakers 
 unite in sustaining the use of the short Italian a in this 
 class of words. 
 
 Whenever the student is in doubt about the correct pro- 
 nunciation of a w r ord, he should carefully consult his diction- 
 ary. The culpable carelessness of many teachers, preachers, 
 and other public speakers, in not correcting their pronun- 
 ciation by referring to some authority, is deserving of the 
 severest censure. Be sure you know how to use a dictionary, 
 and then use it. Great benefit is also derived from observing 
 the pronunciation of cultivated persons and endeavoring to 
 profit by their example. 
 
 Caution VII. Avoid all affectation and a labored mouth- 
 ing of words. 
 
 Some persons utter their words as though they desired to 
 call special attention to the sound instead of the thought. 
 In the endeavor to utter every elementary sound correctly, 
 too much prominence is often given to unimportant words. 
 


## p. 40 (#46) ##############################################

 While an accurate pronunciation is desirable, it should be of 
 the kind that is easy and seemingly natural. The language 
 should serve the speaker, and not the speaker the language. 
 Remember that 
 
 " All affectation but creates disgust ; 
 And e'en in speaking we may seem too just." 
 
 Caution VIII. Avoid confining the eyes continually to 
 the book or manuscript. 
 
 The child, in learning to read, acquires the power of ut- 
 tering successive words at sight. The student may acquire 
 the power of uttering successive phrases and sentences at 
 sight. This will enable him to frequently take his eyes from 
 the page, and look at his hearers, which is particularly 
 important in conveying thought, sentiment and feeling. No 
 gesture should ever be made while confining the eyes to the 
 page. 
 
 Caution IX. Avoid reading or speaking in a pitch so 
 low that you can not be distinctly heard. 
 
 If the auditor has to make a special effort to hear what is 
 said, he soon becomes wearied and disgusted. Such words as 
 are not uttered loud enough to be heard, may as w r ell be 
 omitted entirely, provided the reader or speaker has any 
 respect for his audience. 
 
 Persons who propose to express themselves only by means 
 of what they say, should be especially careful to make 
 themselves heard and understood. 
 
 Caution X. Avoid transitions which the meaning does 
 not demand. 
 


## p. 41 (#47) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 41 
 
 Improper transitions with respect to pitch and force are 
 the most common. We often hear a sentence commenced in 
 a sufficiently loud tone, and then hear the voice descend to 
 nearly a whisper. Some speakers will commence their dis- 
 courses in the proper pitch, and, as they become more ani- 
 mated, will elevate the pitch to a high degree, entirely regard- 
 less of the character of their discourses. The pitch should 
 not be elevated toward the close of a speech, or any where 
 else, unless the meaning demands it. It is not only possible, 
 but often more appropriate, to exhibit a great degree of 
 earnestness, while continuing in the same pitch, and even 
 when lowering it. Transitions with respect to pitch and 
 force are often necessary, but they should never have their 
 origin in the whims of the speaker. 
 
 Caution XI. Avoid the sing-song tone in rendering po- 
 etical discourse. 
 
 It is the author's duty to attend to the rhythm and melody 
 of poetry and not the reader's. Possibly a slight pause is 
 admissible at the end of each line in poetry, though there 
 may be no grammatical pause. The attention given to " po- 
 etic pauses/' more often results in harm than in good. Gen- 
 erally speaking, the sense should dictate the manner of the 
 expression in poetry, as well as in prose. 
 
 Caution XII. Avoid the combative style in the delivery of 
 unimpassioned discourse. 
 
 Many young men have developed the ability to speak in 
 public without embarrassment, by means of exercises in 
 debating clubs. In such societies, the members are pitted 
 
 4 
 


## p. 42 (#48) ##############################################

42 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 against each other in oratorical contests, and, naturally 
 enough, each member is excited to great earnestness in 
 endeavoring to secure a decision in favor of his side of the 
 question ; and by frequent exercise of this kind, a decidedly 
 fighting style of delivery is often acquired. This style is 
 generally accompanied by frequent, violent, and unbecom- 
 ing gesticulation. Debating clubs furnish excellent incen- 
 tives for improvement in knowledge and oratory, but the 
 student should guard himself in the use of them as in the 
 use of sharp tools ; for it must be admitted that the debater 
 often acquires a combative style of delivery, which exhibits 
 itself on occasions to which it is not at all suited. 
 
 Caution XIII. Avoid depending only upon writers and 
 teachers for improvement in elocution. 
 
 There are many good readers and eloquent speakers who 
 have attained to distinction, only by means of observation, 
 thought, and practice. Much instruction can be derived 
 from carefully observing the manner of a good reader or 
 speaker. But do not forget to 
 
 " Think for thyself— one good idea, 
 But known to be thine own, 
 Is better than a thousand gleaned 
 From fields by others sown." 
 
 Do not make the mistake to suppose that these matters 
 of elocutionary instruction relate only to declamation. The 
 student should know that the better he expresses himself, 
 the better instructor he becomes and the greater his influence 
 in the world. A life of noble purposes, ably and artistically 
 given to the world, is a blessing to mankind and an honor 
 to God.

METHODS OF CLASS WORK. 
 
 In teaching children the alphabet, I believe the proper 
 order of proceeding is, first the object, then the picture, then 
 the word, then the names of the letters in the word. In the 
 beginning, do not use charts or books, except to present 
 pictures to the class. Do not be afraid of wasting time by 
 talking pleasantly to a class about a picture. Express your- 
 self in terms which the children will understand, and teach 
 them, for example, that the picture of a cat causes us to 
 think about a real cat ; that the word, eat, is another kind of 
 a picture, which causes us to think of a real cat. Have 
 them pronounce the word distinctly, then teach them the 
 names of the letters, and finally to print the letters. Do not 
 be in a hurry, and follow an order w T hich will introduce only 
 one new letter in each new word ; as, ox, box, fox, boy, ax, 
 toy, cat, hat, &c. Put the work, first, on the black-board, 
 and avoid taking too much for a lesson. You will thus need 
 a list of twenty-five words with w 7 hich to acquaint your 
 pupils with the alphabet, after which I would introduce 
 other suitable w r ords for drill in calling words at sight, and 
 spelling. 
 
 Next, draw from the pupils, by questions, expressions of 
 monosyllabic sentences in regard to familiar objects; as, 
 "An ox is big." "An ox can eat hay." Print on the 
 black-board, have the pupils spell, pronounce, read and 
 copy. Continue this method for several weeks, after which 
 the class will be ready for a " First Keader." We insist

 that there is great advantage in having the child read sen- 
 tences which it has itself originally expressed. In most 
 primary readers, all the new and difficult words of a lesson 
 are arranged in columns for drill in ^ipn^ipYvmid spelling. 
 Teach your pupils to articulate distinctly all the words of a 
 lesson, before leaving it ; and I would spend more time in the 
 simple pronunciation of words than in phonetic analysis. * 
 I do not wash to offer any argument against pKonetic spell- 
 ing, knowing that many tgach^rs do not give as much atten- 
 tion to the elementary sounds as they: should ; but I do 
 wish that all teachers could understand that phonetic spell- 
 ing is only a means and not an end in education. If a pu- 
 pil can pronounce a word distinctly arid spell it orthograph- 
 ically, he has accomplished what is accessary in practice, 
 and I do not care whether he 7 can, analyze it phonetically or 
 not. Unless phonetic analysis can be used, as a means oi 
 improving the articulation, it ia worthless, A child cer- 
 tainly receives most jWords as units of speech and not as col- 
 lections of units. la words of more thau one syllable, the 
 teacher should frequently treat the syllable as the unit of 
 speech, teaching a correct pronunciation "of . each separate 
 syllable, which exercise will generally secure -a- correct pro- 
 nunciation of the whole word. As the pupils advance, they 
 will be enabled to (Jo more in analysis. 
 
 PAUSES. 
 
 Many authors and professional elocutionists refuse to re- 
 oogniza punctuation jnarks as having any .relation to read- 
 ing. I am aware that in " upper shelf " elocution there 
 is little attention paid to them. But iiv the teacher's prac- 
 tical work, I observe that they are, a matter of concern and 
 


## p. 47 (#53) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 47 
 
 importance. Owing to die necessarily simple arrangement 
 of the matter in primary readers, it is not necessary to give 
 attention to punctuation; but, as the pupils advance, these 
 -marks can be made of great use to them. In primary and 
 intermediate readers, containing suitable matter, the gram- 
 matical and rhetorical pauses generally coincide. The 
 teacher, taking advantage of this fact, enables his pupils to 
 be governed not only by what they suppose is the meaning, 
 but by visible signs which may indicate proper pauses and 
 inflections; and through these pauses and inflections the 
 meaning is made more apparent to the pupil. 
 
 It is the custom of many good teachers to acquaint their 
 pupils with following rules:- 1. Wherever a comma oc- 
 curs, the meaning demands a- slight pause. 2. Wherever a 
 semicolon, colon, or exclamation point? -occurs, the meaning 
 demands a longer pause than at a comma, and the falling in- 
 flection. 3. Wherever a period occurs, the meaning de- 
 mands the longest-pause and the falling inflection. 4. An 
 interrogation point denotes a question : the inflection to be 
 determined by the kind of question—that is, whether direct 
 or indirect. In the work suited to young pupils, these rules 
 are of sufficiently general application to be of some use in 
 teaching — the exceptions being in colloquial pieces, which 
 fact <^an be easily taught. . : - 
 
 Children are not capable of comprehending the grammat- 
 ical significance of punctuation marks, and if they are not 
 taught to rdgard them as having some -rhetorical relation, 
 then they are 'of m use to the pupil whatever; and, in that 
 case, a pupil would read a selection just as well if it were 
 not punctuated at all. 
 
 Suppose a pupil, unacquainted with marks of punctua- 
 tion, were required to ^eadnhe"foHo#ftigK 1. "What! Do

 you think I will shave you for nothing, and give you a 
 drink?" 2. " Lord Palmer entered; on his head, a white 
 hat; on his feet, large but well polished boots ; in his hand, 
 his faithful walking stick ; on his countenance, a smile : say- 
 ing nothing, he sat down. " In the first example the pupil 
 would just as likely say, "What do you think? I will 
 shave you for nothing and give you a drink ! " In the sec- 
 ond example he would probably say, " Lord Palmer entered 
 on his head; a white hat on his feet;" etc. As the pupil 
 advances into the more complex and difficult forms of ex- 
 pression, the exceptions to the rules just given multiply, 
 until finally the rules should be almost entirely abandoned. 
 Care must be taken that pupils do not fall into the error of 
 supposing that pauses are proper only where marks of punc- 
 tuation are found. Specific rules in regard to pauses, not 
 coinciding with any marks, are of no value. The most 
 important of such pauses, is that occurring just before an 
 important emphatic expression. The pupil should be taught 
 to exercise his judgment in regard to them. The pupil 
 should be taught to improve the opportunities, which many 
 pauses afford, of taking the breath. We suggest now, some 
 varieties of class w f ork, each of which should be occasionally 
 used : 
 
 1. Call on a pupil to state, in his own language, the sub- 
 stance of the lesson. Call on others until you have secured 
 a general statement of the substance of the lesson. This 
 will incite the pupils to the right kind of study. 
 
 2. Drill the pupils singly and in concert, on the difficult 
 words of the lesson. 
 
 3. Call on the pupils to read a verse each in regular 
 succession. 
 
 4. Call on the pupils to read, miscellaneously. 
 


## p. 49 (#55) ##############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 49 
 
 5. Let each pupil read until he makes a mistake, observ- 
 ing which pupil reads furthest without making a mistake. 
 
 6. Have a pupil read until he makes a mistake, and the 
 next pupil commence where the mistake is made. 
 
 7. Ask the class questions in regard to words, phrases, 
 and sentences, the meaning of which is not likely to be 
 understood. 
 
 8. Give incidental, oral instruction in regard to historical 
 events and important personages, alluded to in the lesson. 
 This will add to the general intelligence of the pupils, and, 
 what is of more importance, will aw T aken a desire for general 
 reading. 
 
 9. Select choice passages, have them committed to memory 
 and read in the usual way. 
 
 10. Engage in a brief exercise in gymnastics or calis- 
 thenics. 
 
 11. Select suitable passages for practice in gesture. 
 
 12. Select suitable passages and have the class read by 
 sections, or all in concert. 
 
 13. Read a passage, purposely making several mistakes, 
 and have the pupils criticise. 
 
 14. Read correctly for the class that they may see and 
 hear a model. 
 
 15. Assign to each pupil a different part of the same 
 selection, have it committed to memory, and recite without 
 looking in the book. Afterward have the class declaim the 
 selection before the school, the members of the class de- 
 claiming in the order of their parts. 
 
 16. Make suggestions and explanations in regard to the 
 succeeding lesson. 
 
 Of course, only a few of the methods given, can be em- 
 ployed in any one recitation. The teacher should invent 
 


## p. 50 (#56) ##############################################

50 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 and use other methods of his own. Any number of rules 
 will not supply a lack of judgment, originality, and energy 
 on the part of the teacher. Do not adhere tenaciously to 
 any one method of class work, for if you do, you will fail. 
 Bring to bear a variety of means, by which you will be 
 enabled to awaken an interest among your pupils, and incite 
 them to successful efforts. Make special preparation for m 
 each recitation, especially when teaching advanced pupils. 
 In all cases have the pupils assume a proper position before 
 attempting to read. Encourage them to ask questions 
 concerning the meaning of the author. Orthographical 
 spelling does not necessarily belong to a recitation in reading, 
 though there can be no serious objection to its occasional 
 use, especially in the recitations of young pupils. Pupils 
 should be taught to criticise each other in regard to position, 
 articulation, emphasis, inflection, pitch, time, force, transition 
 and quality of tone. Choice selections should be read before 
 the school, the pupil taking his eyes from the page as much 
 as possible. By the use of this exercise and method 15, 
 there will be little difficulty in teaching declamation. Be 
 careful in selecting pieces to be committed to memory. 
 Avoid the use of too much poetry, and selections too diffi- 
 cult for your pupils to render creditably. 
 
 Finally, reading should always be regarded as a branch 
 of moral and esthetic culture. In the reading recitation, 
 more than in any other, the teacher has many excellent 
 opportunities of making such impressions as will elevate 
 his pupils to a higher and better plane of thought and ac- 
 tion. Show that you are deeply interested in any noble 
 traits of character a selection may suggest, or any moral it 
 may teach. Seize every opportunity of making your pupils 
 better ; and even when you are dead, they will remember you

 with gratitude, for having developed in them the integrity 
 and moral power, which enabled them to mount the path of 
 honor in this life, and possibly of happiness in the life to 
 come.

SELECTIONS. 
 
 THE ENCHANTED HILL. 
 
 In reading this selection, avoid the incorrect pronunciation of " sum- 
 mit," "object," "allured," "fatal," "enticements," " victims," "na- 
 ture," and "passions." See Cautions 4th and 6th. In the last sen- 
 tence, Eules 9th and 13th are illustrated. 
 
 Among the fascinating stories of the Orientals is one 
 which describes an enchanted hill, whose summit concealed 
 an object of incomparable worth. It was offered as a prize 
 to him who should ascend the hill without looking behind 
 him. But whoever ventured to secure this treasure was 
 told that, if he did look backward, he should be instantly 
 changed into a stone. Many a princely youth, allured by 
 the tempting prize, had ventured up that fatal hill ; and as 
 many had been changed to stones. For the adjacent groves 
 were filled with most melodious voices, and with birds ot 
 sweetest song, whose bewitching strains and enticements fol- 
 lowed each youth as he ascended, till he suffered his innate 
 curiosity to control his hopes and fears — turned his head 
 and instantly became a stone. Hence, said the story, the 
 hill-side was covered with stones. 
 
 To every young man, life is such an enchanted hill, with 
 its thousands of alluring voices and its unnumbered victims, 
 who, prompted from within themselves, have listened to 
 some fatal charmer of the senses, and have perished. Yet no 
 one of them ever fell of necessity. Had they repressed the

 inward desire of evil, by directing the energy of their souls 
 after the great prizes of religion and virtue, they would have 
 become conquerors ; for outward things have power only in 
 proportion to the disposition of the mind to be affected by 
 them. Why, for example, does the sublime and beautiful 
 scenery of the Alps a weaken no emotions of beauty or sub- 
 limity in the breast of the muleteer, whose life is spent in 
 traversing their passages? And why does that same scen- 
 ery hold the reflective and religious mind in rapt admira- 
 tion? The answer is simple, but significant. Between na- 
 ture and the muleteer there exists no sympathy. He is har- 
 dened against her. But the soul of the meditative and cul- 
 tivated man is in harmony w T ith her charms. Hence, over 
 the former she has no power, while she inspires the latter 
 with rapture. So with the charms of vice ; they fall pow- 
 erless upon minds w T hich, cased in the mail of virtue, are 
 proof against them ; but they are omnipotent to those whose 
 undisciplined passions are looking out upon life with pruri- 
 ent curiosity. Such young men are doomed to illustrate the 
 fable of the Orient, and to lie along the highways of life — 
 hardened, undone, and lost. — Daniel Wise. 
 
 INDUSTRY AND ELOQUENCE. 
 
 The ideas embodied in this selection ought to encourage every stu- 
 dent of elocution. The facts stated are undisputed, and the views of 
 the author are, undoubtedly, correct. In reading this, avoid mispro- 
 nouncing ' ' orators, " " natural, ' ' ' ' passed, " " intellectual, " " endow- 
 ments," "eminence," "process," "gesture," "masters," "experi- 
 ment," "last," and "effort." See Cautions 4th and 6th. 
 
 In the ancient republics of Greece and Rome, oratory 
 was a necessary branch of a finished education. A much

 smaller proportion of the citizens were educated than among 
 us; but of these a much larger proportion became orators. 
 No man could hope for distinction or influence, and yet 
 slight this art. The commanders of their armies were ora- 
 tors as well as soldiers, and ruled as well by their rhetorical 
 as by their military skill. There was no trusting with them, 
 as with us, to a natural facility, or the acquisition of an ac- * 
 cidental fluency by occasional practice. They served an ap- 
 prenticeship to the art. They passed through a regular 
 course of instruction in schools. They submitted to long 
 and laborious discipline. They exercised themselves fre- 
 quently, both before equals and in the presence of teachers, 
 who criticised, reproved, rebuked, excited emulation, and 
 left nothing undone which art and perseverance could ac- 
 complish. 
 
 The greatest orators of antiquity, so far from being favor- 
 ed by natural tendencies, except, indeed, in their high intel- 
 lectual endownments, had to struggle against natural obsta- 
 cles ; and, instead of growing up spontaneously to their un- 
 rivaled eminence, they forced themselves forward by the 
 most discouraging, artificial process. 
 
 Demosthenes combated an impediment in speech and an 
 ungainliness of gesture, which, at first, drove him from the 
 forum in disgrace. Cicero failed, at first, through weakness 
 of lungs and excessive vehemence of manner, which wearied 
 the hearers and defeated his own purpose. These defects 
 were conquered by study and discipline. He exiled himself 
 from home, and during his absence, in various lands, passed 
 not a day without a rhetorical exercise, seeking masters who 
 were most severe in criticism, as the surest means of leading 
 him to the perfection at which he aimed. Such, too, was 
 the education of their other great men. They were all,

 according to their ability and station, orators — orators, not 
 by nature or accident, but by education, formed in a strict 
 process of rhetorical training. 
 
 The inference to be drawn from these observations, is, 
 that if so many of those who received an accomplished edu- 
 cation, became accomplished orators, because to become so 
 was one purpose of their study ; then it is in the power of 
 a much larger proportion among us to form ourselves into 
 creditable and accurate speakers. The inference should not 
 be denied until proved false by experiment. 
 
 Let this art be made an object of attention; let young 
 men train themselves to it faithfully and long ; and if any 
 of competent talents and tolerable science be found, at last, 
 incapable of expressing themselves in continued and con- 
 nected discourse, so as to answer the ends of public speak- 
 ing, then, and not till then, let it be said, that a peculiar 
 talent, or natural aptitude is requisite, the want of which 
 must render effort vain : then, and not till then, let us ac- 
 quiesce in this indolent and timorous notion, which contra- 
 dicts the whole testimony of antiquity and all the experience 
 of the world. — Wirt.

 has ever seen. There are two circumstances which render 
 the occasion on which it was delivered extraordinary. First, 
 it was a very public occasion. A vast multitude from al- 
 most every part of the country were assembled. Judea, the 
 southern province, and Galilee, the northern, were repre- 
 sented; so were the eastern and western shores of the river 
 Jordan, and many distant cities and towns. 
 
 From all this wide extent of country a vast multitude, 
 attracted by the fame of our Saviour's miracles, had assem- 
 bled to hear what this professed messenger from heaven had 
 to say. Again, it was probably, though not certainly, a very 
 early occasion; perhaps the first on which the great princi- 
 ples of the gospel were to be announced to men by this dis- 
 course, containing, as it does, so plain and specific an ex- 
 position of the false notions of religion then prevailing. 
 
 The Saviour must have known that he was laying the 
 foundation of that emnity which was to result in his destruc- 
 tion. But did he shrink? Did he hold back? Did he con- 
 ceal or cover over one single obnoxious feature of the truth ? 
 He knew that the report of that meeting must be spread to 
 every part of the country. As he looked around upon his 
 auditory, he must have seen, here one from Galilee, there 
 another from beyond the Jordan, and again a third, who 
 would carry his report to distant Jerusalem ; and yet, thus 
 completely exposed, instead of attempting to soften or con- 
 ceal, he brought out all the distinctive features of prevailing 
 error, and contrasted them with the pure principles of his 
 spiritual religion, with a plainness and a point which was 
 exactly calculated to fix them in memory, and to circulate 
 them most widely throughout the land. It was always so. 
 The plainness, the point, the undaunted boldness, with w r hich 
 he exposed hypocrisy and sin, and the clear simplicity with

 which he held up to view the principles of real piety, have 
 no parallel. And yet he knew perfectly well that, in direct 
 consequence of these things, a dark storm was gathering, 
 which must burst in all its fury upon his unsheltered head. 
 But the enterprising and determined spirit with which 
 Christ entered into his work, was not satisfied with his own 
 personal exertions. He formed the extraordinary plan of 
 sending out, simultaneously, a number of his most cordial 
 friends and followers, to assist in making the most extensive 
 and powerful impression possible on the community. At 
 first he sent twelve, then seventy, who went everywhere, 
 presenting to men. the simple duties of repentance for the 
 past, and of pure and holy lives for the future. There 
 could not have been measures more admirably adapted to 
 accomplish the work he had to do. And they succeeded. 
 In two or three years it was done. And every Christian, 
 who has work to do for his Master here, should learn a 
 lesson from the enterprise, and system, and energy, wdrich 
 Jesus Christ exhibited in doing his great work. — Abbott. 
 
 AND WHAT THEN? 
 
 In reading this selection, several transitions with respect to charac- 
 ter of tone, are necessary. The narrative of the writer, the language of 
 the "holy man," and that of the " young man," each require a some- 
 what different tone of voice. The reason why some persons do not 
 accomplish anything in personation is, they do not commence at the 
 beginning. Until this . selection can be read respectably, there is no 
 need of undertaking anything more difficult. 
 
 A 8TOBY is told of a good man who was living at a uni- 
 versity, when a young man, whom he had known as a boy, 
 ran up to him with a face full of delight, and told him that

 what he had long been wishing above all things in the 
 world was at length fulfilled; his parents having just given 
 him leave to study law ; and thereupon he had come to the 
 law school at his university on account of his great fame, 
 and meant to spare no labor or pains in getting through his 
 studies as quickly and as well as possible. In this way he 
 ran on a long time; and when at last he came to a stop, m 
 the holy man, who had been listening to him with great pa- 
 tience and kindness, said : "Well, and when you have got 
 through your course of studies, what do you mean to do 
 then?" "Then I shall take my Doctor's degree," answer- 
 ed the young man. " And what then ? " asked he. "And 
 then," continued the youth, " I shall have a number of dif- 
 ficult and knotty causes to manage, shall catch people's no- 
 tice by my eloquence, my zeal, my acuteness, and gain a 
 great reputation." "And what then?" repeated the holy 
 man. "And then," replied the youth, "there can't be a 
 question, I shall be promoted to some high office or other ; 
 besides, I shall make money and grow rich." " And what 
 then?" repeated the good man. " And then," pursued the 
 young lawyer, " I shall live comfortably and honorably in 
 wealth and dignity, and shall be able to look forward quiet- 
 ly to a happy old age." "And what then?" "And then," 
 said the youth, " I shall die." Here the holy man again 
 asked, "And what then?" Whereupon the young man 
 made no answer, but cast down his head and went away. 
 The last, And what then? had pierced like a flash of light- 
 ning into his soul, and he could not get clear of it. Soon 
 after he forsook the study of law, and gave himself up to 
 the ministry of Christ, and spent the remainder of his days 
 in godly words and works. 
 
 The question which was put to the young lawyer, is one

 which we should put frequently to ourselves. When we 
 have done all that we are doing, all that we aim at doing, 
 even supposing that all our dreams are accomplished, that 
 every wish of our heart is fulfilled, still we may ask, what 
 will we do, what will be then ? Whenever we cast our 
 thoughts forward, never let them stop short on this side of 
 the grave ; let them not stop short at the grave itself; but 
 when we have followed ourselves thither, and have seen 
 ourselves laid therein, still ask ourselves the searching 
 question, And what theji f 
 
 A PATRIOT OF THE LATE WAR. 
 
 This is an excellent selection for practice in the use of natural lan- 
 guage. The earnestness and emotion of the author can not be ex- 
 pressed in mere words. There are few sentences in this that do not 
 demand some particular facial expression or gesture. Just when each 
 gesture should be made, and the kind of gesture needed, will be suffi- 
 ciently apparent to those who study the selection properly. It should 
 be thoroughly committed to memory, and frequently recited. See 
 Rules 3d and 5th, and Caution 2d. 
 
 1. Captain Miller, an aged soldier of the Federal army 
 in the late war, was visited at one time by a couple of young 
 men, who, at the time of the war, were too young to en- 
 gage in the struggle, but w T ho were always interested in 
 what the old man could tell them about the war. Upon 
 this occasion he grew very earnest while talking to them, 
 and, finally, drew tears from their eyes. 
 
 His musket lay on two wooden hooks against the wall of 
 the room. He took down that musket which he had owned 
 so long, and wmich in all his distress, he would never sell. 
 Moving himself to the table, he laid one of his crutches

 upon it. Resting upon the other, he shouldered the musket, 
 striking it smartly with his right hand to make the bands 
 rattle, as he used to do when a young soldier on dress 
 parade. 
 
 2. Suddenly he uttered a deep sigh, and his eye glistened 
 with a starting tear. He stood, for a short time, perfectly 
 still, holding his musket at arm's length, and looking very 
 steadily upon it. He appeared to be thinking of the many 
 places where he had been with that musket. For he had 
 carried it thousands of miles, and many friends dear to him 
 had he seen fall bleeding around him, before his own leg 
 was shot off in battle. Trembling with strong feeling, he 
 wiped a tear from his furrowed cheek. " Oh," said the aged 
 man, "I have not words to express my thoughts. The 
 memory of past years rushes like a flood and hurries my 
 mind away from this little cottage that shelters me. 
 
 3. I fancy myself standing on a high mountain, surveying 
 the grandest nation on which the sun ever shone. I behold 
 myriads of children through a long train of generations, 
 thoughtless, gay as the birds, and liable to go astray because 
 they know not their own blessings. Oh, that they would 
 listen to the warnings of age and be wise ! If I could, I 
 would speak to all the young people of America at once. 
 My voice should be heard from the shores of Maine to the 
 Rocky Mountains, and from the ocean to the inland seas. I 
 would lay the great cause of our dear country before them. 
 I would call up every noble feeling in their bosoms. I 
 would put the question to their hearts, Can you content 
 yourselves to follow at a distance the slavish rules of foreign 
 lands, instead of raising high the banner of our own free- 
 dom as a model for all nations? 
 
 4. Have you read what your fathers and brothers have

 done? Have you heard of the glory they gained? And do 
 these things seem like old fables, because they happened 
 without the immediate vicinity of your own neighborhood ? 
 Go, then, my young friends, and view the fields they trod, 
 when the sun looked fiery and dim through the smoke of 
 war, and stout hearts fainted; when widows and orphans 
 were multiplied as their defenders fell. Go, in the generous 
 ardor of youth, and trace upon the frost-bound earth, to 
 Tennessee, the honest farmers of our land, by their footsteps 
 marked in blood. Behold the suffering band, and some of 
 your kinsmen among them. Their anxious chief watching 
 in his little tent through the silent hours of night, and 
 learn of them to love your country. 
 
 5. Go to Gettysburg, to Antietam, to Pittsburg Landing, 
 or the bloody fields of Nashville and Atlanta. See our 
 brave men cut down on the battle plain, steeping the soil 
 with their warm blood, breathing their prayers to heaven at 
 once for their own parting souls and their country's cause, 
 and inquire of them if the privileges you enjoy were bought 
 at a cheap rate. Go where Europe has for a hundred ages 
 swelled her domes refined in vice and strengthened her 
 abuses. See there the pale victim of lawless power in his 
 lone dungeon, encircled by chains and torturing machines, 
 wearing away his life by slow degrees, without hope of see- 
 ing upon earth a helping hand or a pitying tear, and ask him 
 if freedom is a blessing of trifling value. 
 
 6. Oh, my dear lads," said he to the young men, "you 
 are just entering upon the stage of manhood; full of life 
 and heart-cheering hope. You see me, poor and decrepit, 
 drawing near to the grave, my resting place. But such as 
 I am, I have always lived an honest life. I have abhorred 
 fraud and falsehood. I have tried to be useful to my fellow

 men. I can lay my hand on my heart, and look up with 
 humble confidence to that Being who knows all my thoughts ; 
 and I would not change my situation, as a free American, 
 with the proudest monarch of the globe. No, no ! Not all 
 their glittering trappings, nor bayonets of pampered guards, 
 nor flattering tongues, can save them from a guilty con- 
 science and a dying bed." 
 
 Observe the appropriate inflection in reading the direct questions at 
 the conclusion of the third verse and beginning of the fourth. For the

 ECONOMY. 
 
 This selection is an excellent reading exercise. Considerable modu- 
 lation is necessary in order to do justice to the author. A poor reader 
 will give the language of the author, and that of the persons alluded 
 to, all in the same tone of voice. The quotations should be expressed 
 in the conversational tone, but care should be taken to not express the 
 language of Ralph and that of the exquisites in the same tone. The tone 
 of a sensible young man like Ealph, is generally more cultivated and 
 pleasant than the tone of "an empty-brained exquisite." Short 
 explanatory passages from the author, interlarding direct quotations, 
 should be regarded as parenthetical, expressions. See Eule 19th, and 
 Caution 8th. 
 
 Ralph Montcalm is a merchant's clerk, enjoying a fair 
 salary. His age is about twenty-two; his appearance is 
 genteel, without foppishness ; his manners are gentlemanly 
 and polite, without affectation. By strict fidelity to the du- 
 ties of his station, he has gained a high reputation for in- 
 dustry, energy, and integrity. He is also understood to be 
 worth a few hundred dollars, which he has invested with 
 great caution and judgment, where it will yield him a safe 
 and profitable return. The general impression concerning

 him, among the merchants in his vicinity, is, that he will 
 one day be a man of some importance in society. A shrewd 
 business man remarked, one day, to his employer, " Your 
 clerk has the elements of a successful merchant." 
 
 "Yes, sir; Ralph is destined to wield considerable in- 
 fluence 'on 'change/ one of these days; and being very eco- 
 nomical in his habits, he can hardly fail of becoming a rich 
 man." Such was the reply of Ralph's master. It showed 
 that the clerk was acting on those principles which insure 
 success. Yet Ralph's conduct found no sympathy from 
 the fashionable disciples of dandyism, who were filling sit- 
 uations similar to his own, as w T ill be seen from the follow- 
 ing conversations. 
 
 Ralph was walking home, one evening, from his count- 
 ing-room, when a fellow clerk, who was quite an exquisite 
 in his own estimation, overtook him. He was puffing a 
 cigar after the most approved fashion. Stepping up to 
 Ralph, he touched him on the arm, and said, " Good even- 
 ing, Mr. Montcalm." 
 
 " Good evening, sir," replied Ralph, to this salutation. 
 
 A few commonplaces passed between them, and then the 
 dandy, taking out his case of Havanas, said, " Will you 
 take a cigar with me, Mr. Montcalm?" 
 
 " I thank you, sir, but I never smoke," replied Ralph, 
 with an emphasis w^hich left no room for persuasion. 
 
 " Never smoke ! " exclaimed the astonished dandy, re- 
 placing the cigar-case in his pocket. " What on earth can 
 induce you to deny yourself so delicious a luxury ? " 
 
 " It is a luxury that costs too much, sir, for me to indulge 
 in it. I really can not afford it." 
 
 " O, I see," retorted the smoker, as he puffed forth an 
 enormous column of smoke from his steaming mouth ; "you

 belong to the race of misers, and are set on saving your 
 money, instead of enjoying life as it passes. For my part, 
 I despise all such stinginess, and calculate to enjoy all the 
 pleasure money will buy." 
 
 Ralph took no notice of his companion's impolite insinu- 
 ations, but in a kindly tone answered : " The use of tobacco, 
 in any form, is positively injurious to health and intellect; 
 as a habit, it is filthy, vulgar, and disgusting, to all but 
 those who use it. Beside this, it makes a heavy and con- 
 stant drain on the purse. I confess I am too stingy to pay 
 so high a price for a ' luxury ' which would shorten my life, 
 fill me with disease, and render me disgusting to others. I 
 would rather save my money for high and noble uses." 
 
 This sensible reply was too much for the smoker to en- 
 dure. He, therefore, gruffly replied : " You talk more like 
 a Puritan than a gentleman ;" and hurried forward, leaving 
 Ralph to his reflections, which were certainly more agree- 
 able than the company of such an empty-brained exquisite. 
 
 On another occasion, he was thrown into the society of 
 another of these contemptible children of fashion, who, in 
 the course of conversation, inquired, " Where do you board, 
 Mr. Montcalm?" 
 
 " At Mrs. Brown's, in Grace street." 
 
 " Indeed ! How can you think of boarding in such an 
 unfashionable street?" 
 
 " It is my fashion to seek respectability, comfort, clean- 
 liness, and purity, in my home; and all these I have at 
 Mrs. Brown's." 
 
 " That may be ; but Grace street is such an unfashionable 
 street — and Mrs. Brown is a poor woman." 
 
 " Very true; but still I find genuine comfort, abundant 
 food and amiable society at her house; and at a price which

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 65 
 
 I can well afford to pay. What, then, should I gain by 
 going up town to one of your fashionable houses? What 
 do you pay where you board ?" 
 
 " I pay rather high in proportion to my salary, to be 
 sure. My board costs me six dollars a w r eek. But then 
 every thing is in style; the boarders are all fashionable 
 young men, and I get into some of the highest society in the 
 city through their influence, besides gaining the reputation 
 of being fashionable myself." 
 
 " But how do you manage to meet all your expenses ? 
 Your salary is only five hundred dollars per annum. You 
 pay over three hundred dollars for board. Your other ex- 
 penses are in proportion. I do not see how you can ever 
 expect to rise above your clerkship, or even to marry, 
 without saving something for capital ; and saving, according 
 to your statements, is out of the question." 
 
 " Saving ! Don't talk of saving, Mr. Montcalm ! I 
 should be very happy to be out of debt. As to business or 
 marriage, I dare not think of either, unless some good- 
 natured merchant should be foolish enough to make me his 
 partner." 
 
 " You may well say foolish ; for w r ho but a good-natured 
 fool would dream of taking you, or any other slave of fash- 
 ionable life, into partnership? For myself, I intend both 
 to marry and to enter into business at a proper time. 
 Hence, I can not afford to be a fashionable young man. It 
 costs too much. I prefer the real comfort of a respectable 
 home, and the gains of frugality, to the ruinous reputation 
 of being *a man of fashion.' I wish you good morn- 
 ing, sir." 
 
 "Good morning, Mr. Montcalm," replied the fashionable 
 young gentleman, and they parted ; the former to mount the

 path of honor, the latter to flutter a while, like a stupid 
 moth, around the lamp of fashion, to burn his wings, and 
 then to crawl in obscurity to an unhonored grave. 
 
 — Daniel Wise. 
 
 PARRHASIUS. 
 
 Parrhasius was a Grecian painter. He once painted a picture in 
 which Prometheus was represented as chained, and undergoing the 
 agonies of death. The painter had his servants put a "captive" to 
 death, in order that he might observe the expression of countenance 
 caused by extreme torture, and transfer it to his canvas. 
 
 In this selection, the importance of natural language is well illus- 
 trated. The first stanza is descriptive, the last didactic, and the others, 
 dramatic. The dramatic part should be rendered in quite a different 
 manner from the other parts. 
 
 The description of a past event as present, and all forms of persona- 
 tion, are sometimes called extraordinary elocution. All other kinds of 
 discourse, ordinary elocution. Study the first five rules, then study 
 Parrhasius. This selection should be committed to memory. 
 
 1. Parrhasius stood, gazing forgetfully 
 Upon his canvas. There Prometheus lay, 
 Chained to the cold rocks of Mount Caucasus : 
 The vultures at his vitals, and the links 
 
 Of the lame Lemnian festering in his flesh ; 
 And as the painter's mind felt through the dim, 
 Rapt mystery, and plucked the shadows wild 
 Forth with his reaching fancy, and with form 
 And color clad them, his fine, earnest eye 
 Flashed with a passionate fire, and the quick curl 
 Of his thin nostril, and his quivering lip, 
 Were like the winged god's breathing from his flight.

 My hand feels skillful, and the shadows lift

 From my waked spirit, airily and swift; 
 
 And I could paint the bow 
 Upon the bended heavens ; around me play 
 Colors of such divinity to-day. 
 
 3. "Ha! bind him on his back ! 
 Look ! as Prometheus in my picture here ! 
 
 Quick ! or he faints ! Stand with the cordial near ! 
 
 Now, bend him to the rack ! 
 Press down the poisoned links into his flesh, 
 And tear agape that healing wound afresh ! 
 
 4. "So! let him writhe! How long 
 
 Will he live thus? Quick, my good pencil, now! 
 What a fine agony works upon his brow ! 
 
 Ha! gray-haired and so strong! 
 How fearfully he stifles that short moan ! 
 Gods ! if I could but paint a dying groan ! 
 
 5. "Pity thee? Soldo; 
 
 I pity the dumb victim at the altar ; 
 
 But does the robed priest for his pity falter? 
 
 I'd rack thee, though I knew 
 A thousand lives were perishing in thine ; 
 What were ten thousand to a fame like mine? 
 
 6. "Ah! there's a deathless name ! 
 
 A spirit that the smothering vault shall spurn, 
 And, like a steadfast planet, mount and burn ; 
 
 And though its crown of flame 
 Consumed my brain to ashes as it won me ; 
 By all the fiery stars ! I'd pluck it on me ! 
 
 7. " Ay, though it bid me rifle 
 
 My heart's last fount for its insatiate thirst — 
 Though every life-strung nerve be maddened first ; 
 Though it should bid me stifle

 And taunt its mother till my brain went wild;

 Sooner than die, like a dull worm, to rot ;

 Glazes apace. He does not feel you now. 
 Stand back! Ill paint the death-dew on his brow!

 But for one moment — one — till I eclipse 
 Conception, with the scorn of those calm lips !

 Brokenly now ; that was a difficult breath ; 
 Another? Wilt thou never come, oh, Death? 
 
 Look ! how his temple flutters ! 
 Is his heart still? Aha! lift up his head! 
 He shudders — gasps — Jove help him — so, he's dead V

 Rules this unreined ambition ! Let it once 
 But play the monarch, and its haughty brow 
 Glows with a beauty that bewilders thought 
 And unthrones peace forever. Putting on 
 The very pomp of Lucifer, it turns 
 
 The heart to ashes, and with not a spring 
 
 Left in the desert for the spirit's lip, 
 
 We look upon our splendor, and forget 
 
 The thirst of which we perish. — Willis.

 INDUSTRY NECESSARY FOR THE ORATOR. 
 
 When the student of elocution becomes discouraged, he should study 
 the following selection. It is certainly well calculated to " renew his 
 spiritual strength." In this, a careless reader will mispronounce 
 " history," " eminent," " multitudes," " attainments," " master," 
 "produce," "instruments," "Creator," "fashioned," "intellectual," 
 ''gifts," "encouragement," "effort," instructor," and "sentiment." 
 See Webster's, or Worcester's Dictionary. Observe the concluding 
 series in the last verse. See Rule 13th. 
 
 1. The history of the world is full of testimony to prove 
 how much depends upon industry ; not an eminent author 
 has lived but is an example of it. Yet, in contradiction 
 to all this, the almost universal feeling appears to be, that 
 industry can effect nothing, that eminence is the result of 
 accident, and that every one must be content to remain just 
 what he may happen to be. Thus multitudes, who come 
 forward as teachers and guides, suffer themselves to be satis- 
 fied with the most indifferent attainments, and a miserable 
 mediocrity, without so much as inquiring how they might 
 rise higher, much less making any attempt to rise. 
 
 2. For any other art they would serve an apprenticeship, 
 and would be ashamed to practice it in public, before they 
 have learned it. If any one would sing, he attends a master, 
 and is drilled in the very elementary principles ; and, only 
 after the most laborious process, dares to exercise his voice 
 in public. This he does, though he has scarce anything to 
 learn but the mechanical execution of what lies, in sensible 
 forms, before his eye. But the extempore speaker, who is 
 to invent as well as to utter, to carry on an operation of the 
 mind as well as to produce sound, enters upon the work with 
 out preparatory discipline, and then winders that he fails. 
 
 3. If he were learning to play on the flute for public

 exhibition, what hours and days would he spend in giving 
 facility to his fingers, and attaining the power of the sweet- 
 est and most impressive execution. If he were devoting 
 himself to the organ, what months and years would he labor, 
 that he might know its compass, and be master of its keys, 
 and be able to draw out, at will, all its various combinations 
 of harmonious sounds, and its full richness and delicacv of * 
 expression. And yet, he will fancy, that the grandest, the 
 most various, the most expressive of all instruments, which 
 the infinite Creator has fashioned by the union of an intel- 
 lectual soul with the powers of speech, may be played upon 
 without study or practice. He comes to it a mere unin- 
 structed tyro, and thinks to manage all its stops, and to 
 command the whole compass of its varied and comprehen- 
 sive power. He finds himself a bungler in the attempt, is 
 mortified at his failure, and settles in his mind forever, that 
 he attempts in vain. 
 
 4. Success in every art, whatever may be the natural tal- 
 ent, is always the reward of industry and pains. But the 
 instances are many, of men of the finest natural genius, 
 whose beginning has promised much, but who have degen- 
 erated wretchedly as they advanced, because they trusted to 
 their gifts, and made no effort to improve. That there have 
 never been other men of equal endowments with Cicero and 
 Demosthenes, none would venture to suppose. If those 
 great men had been content, like others, to continue as they 
 began, and had never made their persevering efforts of im- 
 provement, their countries would have been little benefited 
 by their genius, and the world would never have known 
 their fame. They would have been lost in the undistin- 
 guished crowd' that sank to oblivion around them. 
 
 5. Of how many more will the same remark prove true !

 What encouragement is thus given to the industrious! 
 With such encouragement, how inexcusable is the negli- 
 gence which suffers the most interesting and important 
 truths to seem heavy and dull, and fall ineffectual to the 
 ground through mere sluggishness in the delivery ! How 
 unworthy of one who performs the high function of a relig- 
 ious instructor — upon whom depends, in a great measure, 
 the religious knowledge, the devotional sentiment, and final 
 character of many fellow beings — to imagine that he can 
 worthily discharge this great concern by occasionally talk- 
 ing for an hour, he knows not how, and in a manner he has 
 taken no pains to render correct or attractive ; and which, 
 simply through that w 7 ant of command over himself which 
 study would give, is immethodical, verbose, inaccurate, fee- 
 ble and trifling ! It has been said of a great preacher, that 
 " Truths divine come mended from his tongue." Alas ! they 
 come ruined and worthless from such a man as this. They 
 loose that holy energy by which they are to convert the soul 
 and purify man for heaven, and sink, in interest and effi- 
 cacy, below the level of those principles which govern the 
 ordinary affairs of this lower world. — H. Ware, Jr. 
 
 DEATH OF GENERAL LYON. 
 
 The heroic death of General Lyon at the battle of Wilson's Creek, 
 admirably illustrates the patriotic devotion of the true American sol- 
 dier. It is stated that " Funeral honors attended General Lyon, from 
 the field where he fell, across one-half a continent. Such honors were 
 never before, perhaps, paid to so young a general." 
 
 For grand and beautiful imagery, touching pathos and real force, 
 Abbott certainly has no superior. The student of elocution would do 
 well to study his " Civil War in America." This extract is an excel- 
 lent declamatory exercise. Considerable action is necessary in its

 correct delivery. Observe the sudden transitions, with respect to 
 pitch, necessary in the use of the quotations in the last verse.

 1. The battle was now commenced by a fire of shot and 
 
 shell from Capt. Totten's battery, and soon become general. 
 In vain did the rebel host endeavor to drive Lyon from his 
 well-chosen position. On the right, on the left, and in front 
 they assailed him, in charge succeeding charge, but in vain. , 
 His quick eye detected every movement and successfully 
 met and defeated it. The overwhelming number of the 
 rebels enabled them to replace, after each repulse, their de- 
 feated forces with fresh regiments, while Lyon's little band 
 found no time for rest, no respite from the battle. The rebel 
 host surged, wave after wave upon his heroic lines, as billows 
 of the sea dash upon the coast. And as the rocks upon 
 that coast beat back the flood, so did these heroic soldiers of 
 freedom, with courage which would have ennobled veterans, 
 and with patriotism which has won a nation's homage and 
 love, hurl back the tireless surges of rebellion, which threat- 
 ened to engulf them. It will be enough for any of these 
 patriots to say, " I was at the battle of Wilson's Creek," to 
 secure the warmest grasp of every patriot's hand. 
 
 2. Wherever the missiles of death flew thickest, and the 
 peril of the battle was most imminent, there was Gen. Lyon 
 surely to be found. His young troops needed this encour- 
 agement on the part of their adored leader, and it inspired 
 them with bravery, which nothing else could have conferred. 
 His horse had been shot under him; three times he had 
 been wounded, and though faint from loss of blood, he re- 
 fused to retire even to have his wounds dressed ; in vain 
 did his officers beseech him to avoid so much exposure. It 
 was one of those eventful hours, which Gen. Lyon fully 
 comprehended, in which there was no hope but in despair.

 Again and again had the enemy been repulsed, only to 
 return again and again, with fresh troops, to the charge. 
 Colonels Mitchell, Deitzler and Andrews were all severely 
 wounded. All the men were exhausted with the long and 
 unintermitted battle, and it seemed as though one puff of 
 war's fierce tempest would now sweep away the thin and 
 tremulous line. 
 
 3. Just then the rebels again formed in a fresh and solid 
 column for the charge. With firm and rapid tread, and 
 raising unearthly yells, they swept up the slope. Gen. 
 Lyon called for the troops, standing nearest him, to form 
 for the opposing charge. Undaunted, and ready for the 
 battle as ever, they inquired, " Who will be our leader ? " 
 " Come on, brave men," shouted General Lyon, " I will lead 
 you." In a moment he was at their head. At the next 
 moment they were on the full run ; at the next a deadly 
 storm of bullets sw r ept the ranks, staggering but not check- 
 ing them in their impetuous advance. On — on they rushed 
 for God and Liberty ; and in another moment, the foe w r ere 
 dispersed like dust by the gale. The victory was entire ; 
 this division of the rebels could rally no more ; the army 
 was saved; but Lyon was dead! Two bullets had pierced 
 his bosom. As he fell, one of his officers sprang to his side, 
 and inquired anxiously, "Are you hurt?" "Not much," 
 was his faint reply. They were his last words. He fell 
 asleep to wake no more. O! hateful pro-slavery rebellion! 
 such are the victims immolated upon thy polluted shrine. 
 Indignation is blended with the tears we shed, over such 
 sacrifices which we have been compelled to offer to the de- 
 mon of slavery. A nation mourned the loss of Lyon, the 
 true Christian knight, without fear and without reproach. 
 His remains now repose in the peaceful graveyard of his na- 
 tive village. — John S. C. Abbott.

 EXTRA CT FR OM SPEECH OF PA TRICK HENR Y. 
 
 The speeches of Patrick Henry are particularly suitable for purposes 
 of elocutionary drill. It is earnestly recommended that this extract 
 be well committed, and frequently recited. No better exercise can be 
 found for the development of a full, strong voice. It were better to 
 use this well, than to blunder over the whole speech. Care must be 
 taken to keep the lungs well inflated, in order that the emphatic words 
 and phrases may be properly uttered. The " orotund" tone of voice 
 is here demanded. In the closing sentence, the pitch should be low- 
 ered, and the force increased. 
 
 1. They tell us, sir, that we are weak, unable to cope with 
 so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? 
 Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when 
 we are totally disarmed, and w r hen a British guard shall be 
 stationed in every house ? Shall we gather strength by ir- 
 resolution and inaction? Shall we acqfiire the means of 
 effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hug- 
 ging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall 
 have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we 
 make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature 
 hath placed in our power. 
 
 2. Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of 
 liberty, and in such a country as that w r hich we possess, are 
 invincible by any force which our enemy can send against 
 us. Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is 
 a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and 
 who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The 
 victory is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant, the 
 active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we 
 were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire 
 from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and 
 slavery. Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be

 heard on the plains of Boston ! The war is inevitable, and 
 let it come ! I repeat it, sir, let it come ! 
 
 3. It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen 
 may cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The war is 
 actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the Xorth 
 will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our 
 brethren are already in the field! ^ Why stand we here idle? 
 What is it that gentlemen wish ? What would they have ? 
 Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the 
 price of chains and slavery ? Forbid it, Almighty God ! 
 I know rkot what course others may take, but as for me, give 
 me liberty, or give me death ! 
 
 THE SMACK IN SCHOOL. 
 
 In rendering this, four varieties of manner are required: one for 
 the narrative of the author, and a different one for each of the three 
 characters to be personated. This will demand several sudden transi- 
 tions with respect to manner. See Rule 4th. 
 
 A district school, not far away, 
 'Mid Berkshire hills, one winter's day, 
 Was humming with its wonted noise 
 Of threescore mingled girls and boys. 
 Some few upon their tasks intent, 
 But more on furtive mischief bent. 
 The while the master's downward look 
 Was fastened on a copy book; 
 When suddenly behind his back, 
 Rose sharp and clear a rousing smack, 
 As 'twere a battery of bliss 
 Let off in one tremendous kiss.

 " What's that? " the startled master cries ; 
 
 " That, thir," a little imp replies, 
 
 " Wath William Willith, if you pleathe; 
 I thaw him kith Thuthanna Peathe." 
 With frown to make a statue thrill, 
 The master thundered, " Hither, Will ! " 
 Like wretch overtaken in his track, 
 With stolen chattels on his back, 
 Will hung his head in fear and shame, 
 And to the awful presence came — 
 A great, green, bashful simpleton, 
 The butt of all good-natured fun. 
 With smile suppressed, and birch upraised, 
 The threatener faltered : " I'm amazed 
 That you, my biggest pupil, should 
 Be guilty of an act so rude ; 
 Before the whole set school to boot — 
 What evil genius put you to't ? " 
 
 " 'Twas she herself, sir/' sobbed the lad ; 
 
 " I did not mean to be so bad ; 
 But when Susannah shook her curls, 
 And whispered I was 'fraid of girls, 
 And dursn't kiss a baby's doll, 
 I couldn't stand it, sir, at all, 
 But up and kissed her on the spot. 
 I know — boo — hoo — I ought to not, 
 But, somehow, from her looks — boo — hoo — 
 I thought she kind o' wished me to ! "

 NEW- YEARS NIGHT OF AN UNHAPPY MAN. 
 
 Have you ever observed how much more captivating a rhetorical 
 exercise is, when accompanied by appropriate action ? Make use of 
 the necessary gestures in such passages as, "up to the immovable, 
 unfading heaven, and down upon the still, pure, white earth," "grave 
 stood near him/' "right hand," "the left," "face upturned to 
 heaven" "a star shoot from heaven, and glittering in its fall, vanish 
 upon the earth," etc. I have - heard a young lady read this, and a 
 young man declaim it, with excellent effect. 
 
 1. On new-year's night, an old man stood at his window, 
 and looked with a glance of fearful despair, up to the im- 
 movable, unfading heaven, and down upon the still, pure, 
 white earth, on which no one was now so joyless and sleep- 
 less as he. His grave stood near him; it was covered only 
 with the snows of age, not with the verdure of youth ; and 
 he brought with him out of a whole, rich life, nothing but 
 errors, sins, and diseases ; a wasted body ; a desolate soul ; 
 a heart, full of poison ; and an old age, full of repentance. 
 
 2. The happy days of his early youth passed before him, 
 like a procession of specters, and brought back to him that 
 lovely morning, when his father first placed him on the 
 cross-way of life, where the right hand led by the sunny 
 paths of virtue, into a large and quiet land, full of light 
 and harvests ; and the left plunged by the subterranean 
 walks of vice, into a black cave, full of distilling poison, of 
 hissing snakes, and of dark, sultry vapors. 
 
 3. Alas, the snakes were hanging upon his breast, and 
 the drops of poison on his tongue; and he now, at length, 
 felt all the horrors of his situation. Distracted with un- 
 speakable grief, and with a face up-turned to heaven, he 
 cried, " My father ! give me back my youth ! O, place me 
 once again upon life's cross-way, that I may choose aright." 
 


## p. 78 (#84) ##############################################

78 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 But his father and his youth were long since gone. He saw 
 phantom-lights dancing upon the marshes and disappearing 
 at the church yard ; and he said, " These are my foolish 
 days ! " He saw a star shoot from heaven, and glittering in 
 its fall, vanish upon the earth. " Behold an emblem of my 
 career," said his bleeding heart, and the serpent tooth of re- 
 pentance digged deeper into his wounds. 
 
 4. His excited imagination showed him specters flying 
 upon the roof, and a skull, which had been left in the char- 
 nel-house, gradually assumed his own features. In the 
 midst of this confusion of objects, the music of the new year 
 flowed down from the steeple, like distant church-melodies. 
 His heart began to melt. He looked around the horizon, 
 and over the wide earth, and thought of all the friends of 
 his youth, who now, better and happier than he, were the 
 wise of the earth, prosperous men, and the fathers of happy 
 children ; and he said, " Like you, I also might slumber, 
 with tearless eyes, through the long nights, had I chosen 
 aright in the outset of my career. Ah, my father ! had I 
 hearkened to thy instructions, I too might have been happy." 
 
 5. In this feverish remembrance of his youthful days, a 
 skull bearing his own features seemed slowly to rise from the 
 door of the charnel-house. At length, by that superstition 
 which, in the new-year's night, sees the shadow of the fu- 
 ture, it became a living youth. He could look no longer; 
 he covered his eyes; a thousand burning tears streamed 
 down his cheeks, and fell upon the snow. In accents scarce- 
 ly audible, he sighed disconsolately : " O, days of my youth, 
 return, return ! " And they did return. It had only been 
 a horrible dream. But, although he was still a youth, his 
 errors had been a reality. And he thanked God, that he, 
 still young, was able to pause in the degrading course of

 vice, and return to the sunny path which leads to the land 
 of harvests. 
 
 6. Return with him, young man, if thou art walking in 
 the same downward path, lest his dream become thy reality. 
 For if thou turnest not now, in the spring time of thy days, 
 vainly, in after years, when the shadows of age are darken- 
 ing around thee, shalt thou call, "O, beautiful days of 
 youth, return ! " Those beautiful days — gone, gone forever, 
 and hidden in the shadows of the misty past — shall close 
 their ears against thy miserable cries, or answer thee in hol- 
 low accents, " Alas ! we return no more." — Richter. 
 
 PEOPLE WILL TALK 
 
 This should be read in the manner of addressing one personally. 
 It requires the conversational tone of a cultivated person. 
 
 1. We may go through the world, but it will be slow, 
 If we listen all that is said as we go. 
 
 We will be worried and fretted and kept in a stew ; 
 For meddlesome tongues must have something to do. 
 
 For people will talk, you know, people will talk ; 
 
 Oh, yes, they must talk, you know. 
 
 2. If quiet and modest, you'll have it presumed 
 Your humble position is only assumed — 
 
 You're a wolf in sheep's clothing, or else you're a fool; 
 But don't get excited, keep perfectly cool. 
 For people will talk. 
 
 3. If generous and noble, they'll vent out their spleen — 
 You'll hear some loud hints that you're selfish and mean ; 
 If upright and honest and fair as the day, 
 
 They'll call you a rogue in a sly, sneaking way. 
 For people will talk.

 4. And then, if you show the least boldness of heart, 
 Or slight inclination to take your own part, 
 They'll call you an upstart, conceited and vain ; 
 But keep straight ahead, and don't stop to complain. 
 
 For people will talk. 
 
 5. If threadbare your coat, and old-fashioned your hat, 
 Some one of course will take notice of that, 
 
 And hint rather strong that you can't pay your way, 
 But don't get excited, whatever you say. 
 For people will talk. 
 
 6. If you dress in the fashion, don't think to escape, 
 For they will criticise then in a different shape, 
 You're ahead of your means, or your tailor's unpaid ; 
 But mind your own business, there's nought to be made. 
 
 For people will talk. 
 
 7. They'll talk fine before you ; but then at your back, 
 Of venom and slander there's never a lack ; 
 
 How kind and polite in all that they say, 
 But bitter as gall when you are away. 
 For people will talk. 
 
 8. The best way to do is to do as you please, 
 
 For your mind (if you have one) will then be at ease ; 
 Of course you will meet with all sorts of abuse, 
 But don't think to stop them, it isn't any use. 
 
 For people will talk, you know, people will talk; 
 
 O, yes, they must talk, you know.

 INDEPENDENCE BELL. 
 
 "When it became certain that the Declaration of Independence 
 would be adopted and confirmed by the signatures of the delegates in 
 the Continental Congress, it was determined to announce the event 
 by ringing the old State House bell, which bore the inscription, ' Pro- 
 claim liberty to all the land; to all the inhabitants thereof! ' and the old 
 bellman posted his little boy at the door of the hall, to await the 
 instruction of the door-keeper when to ring. At the word that the 
 document had been signed, the little patriot scion rushed out, and 
 flinging up his hands, shouted, 'ring! Ring! King!' " 
 
 1. There was a tumult in the city, 
 
 In that quaint old Quaker town, 
 And the streets were rife with people 
 
 Pacing restless up and down ; 
 People gathering at the corners, 
 
 Where they whispered each to each, 
 And the sweat stood on their temples, 
 
 With the earnestness of speech. 
 
 2. As the bleak Atlantic currents 
 
 Lash the wild Newfoundland shore, 
 So they beat against the State House, 
 
 So they surged against the door; 
 And the mingling of their voices 
 
 Made a harmony profound, 
 Till the quiet street of Chestnut 
 
 Was all turbulent with sound. 
 
 3. " Will they do it?" " Dare they do it?" 
 
 " Who is speaking ? "—What's the news ? " 
 " What of Adams ? "— " What of Sherman ? " 
 " Oh ! God grant they won't refuse ! "

 " Make some way there !" — "Let me nearer!" 
 " I am stifling ! " " Stifle, then, 
 When a nations life's at hazard, 
 We've no time to think of men ! " 
 
 4. So they beat against the portal, 
 
 Men and women, maid and child; 
 And the July sun in heaven 
 
 On the scene looked down and smiled; 
 The same sun that saw the Spartan 
 
 Shed his patriot blood in vain, 
 Now beheld his soul in freedom 
 
 All unconquered, rise again. 
 
 5. So they surged against the State House, 
 
 While, all solemnly inside, 
 Sat the Continental Congress, 
 
 Truth and reason for their guide, 
 O'er a simple scroll debating — 
 
 Which, though simple it might be — 
 Yet should shake the cliffs of England 
 
 With the thunders of the free. 
 
 6. At the portal of the State House, 
 
 Like some beacon in a storm, 
 Round which waves are wildly beating, 
 
 Stood a boyish slender form : 
 With his eyes fixed on the steeple 
 
 And his ears agape with greed 
 To catch the first announcement 
 
 Of the signing of the deed. 
 
 7. Aloft, in that high steeple 
 
 Sat the bellman, old and gray —

 He was weary of the tyrant 
 
 And his iron-sceptered sway. 
 So he sat with one hand ready 
 
 On the clapper of the bell, 
 When his eye should catch the signal. 
 
 The happy news to tell. 
 
 8. See! See! The dense crowd quivers 
 
 Through all its lengthy line, 
 As the boy beside the portal 
 
 Looks forth to give the sign ! 
 With his small hands upward lifted, 
 
 Breezes dallying with his hair, 
 Hark ! with deep, clear intonation, 
 
 Breaks his young voice on the air. 
 
 9. Hushed the people's swelling murmur, 
 
 List the boy's strong joyous cry! 
 "Ring" he shouts, "Ring/ Grandpa! 
 
 Ring! Oh! Ring! for Liberty!" 
 And straightway, at the signal, 
 
 The old bellman lifts his hand, 
 And sends the good news, making 
 
 Iron music through the land. 
 
 10. How they shouted! what rejoicing! 
 
 How the old bell shook the air, 
 Till the clang of freedom ruffled 
 
 The calm gliding Delaware! 
 How the bonfires and the torches 
 
 Illumined the night's repose, 
 And from the flames, like Phoenix, 
 
 Fair Liberty arose.

 11. That old bell is silent now, 
 
 And hushed its iron tongue, 
 But the spirit it awakened 
 
 Still lives — forever young, 
 And while we greet the sunlight 
 
 On the Fourth of each July, 
 We'll ne'er forget the bellman, 
 
 Who between the earth and sky, 
 Rang out Our Independence; 
 
 Which, please God, shall never die.

 THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. 
 
 It will not be difficult to determine the kind of action necessary in 
 rendering this selection. In pronouncing the word God, the short 
 sound of the vowel should be slightly broadened; but do not say 
 " Gawd." 
 
 I have heard a lady pupil declaim this, with ver}^ good effect. 
 
 1. A fibm belief in the existence of God will heighten all 
 the enjoyments of life, and, by conforming our hearts to his 
 will, will secure the approbation of a good conscience, and 
 inspire us with the hopes of a blessed immortality. Never 
 be tempted to disbelieve the existence of God, when every- 
 thing around you proclaims it in a language too plain not to 
 be understood. Never cast your eyes on creation, without 
 having your souls expanded with this sentiment : There is a 
 God. 
 
 2. When you survey this globe of earth, with all its ap- 
 pendages ; when you behold it inhabited by numberless 
 ranks of creatures, all moving in their proper spheres, all 
 verging to their proper ends, all animated by the same

 great source of life, all supported at the same great boun- 
 teous table ; when you behold, not only the earth, but the 
 ocean, and the air, swarming with living creatures, all happy 
 in their situation ; when you behold yonder sun darting an 
 effulgent blaze of glory over the heavens, garnishing mighty 
 worlds, and waking ten thousand songs of praise; when 
 you behold unnumbered systems diffused through vast im- 
 mensity, clothed in splendor, and rolling in majesty; when 
 you behold these things, your affections will rise above all 
 the vanities of time; your full souls will struggle with ec- 
 staey, and your reason, passions, and feelings, all united, 
 will rush up to the skies, with a devout acknowledgment 
 of the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. 
 Let us behold Him, let us wonder, let us praise and adore. 
 These things will make us happy.

 ENERGY. 
 
 This selection would answer a good purpose for a class of five 
 students : each one declaiming a verse in turn. Each verse demands 
 some energy. 
 
 1. Energy is the soul of every great achievement: 
 w 7 hile enervation emasculates the spirit, and dooms the man 
 to obscurity and ill success. Men of feeble action are ac- 
 customed to attribute their misfortunes to what is vulgarly 
 termed " ill luck." They envy the men who climb the 
 ladder of eminence, and call them " the favorite children of 
 fortune — lucky men, and men of peculiar opportunity." 
 This is a Vain and foolish imagination. It is not ill for- 
 tune, so much as an enervated mind, that keeps thousands

86 INSTKUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 in inglorious obscurity. The blundering student, who 
 stammers out an ill-learned lesson in his college class, and 
 gains his diploma, at last, through indulgence rather than 
 merit, owes his degraded position more to that voluntary 
 mental imbecility which has ever shrunk from the labor of 
 study, than to any absolute mental inferiority. His tri- 
 umphant classmate, w T ho quits his college adorned with the 
 proudest honors of his Alma Mater, is as much indebted 
 to his persevering energy, as to his native genius, for his 
 honorable victory. He might, had he been equally supine, 
 have been equally degraded with his unhonored classmate. 
 But his energy saved him. So, in all the other walks of 
 life, energy produces good fortune and success, while en- 
 ervation breeds misfortune and " bad luck." 
 
 2. If any one desires a confirmation of these ideas, let 
 him carefully study the history of every man who has writ- 
 ten his name on the walls of the Temple of Fame. Let 
 him view such minds in their progress toward greatness. 
 He will see them rising step by step, in the face of stub- 
 born difficulties, which gave way before them only because 
 their courage would not be daunted, nor their energy 
 wearied. He will find no exception in the history of man- 
 kind. Supine, powerless souls have always fainted before 
 hostile circumstances, and sank beneath their opportunities; 
 while men of power have wrestled with sublime vigor 
 against all opposing men and things, and obtained success 
 because they would not be defeated. 
 
 3. I might illustrate these views from the biography of 
 any eminent man; but I select Christopher Columbus as 
 peculiarly adapted to my purpose. Bred to the profession 
 of seamanship, and having a strong passion for geographical 
 studies, his thoughtful mind conceived the idea that un-

 known empires existed west of the great Atlantic. He 
 dwelt upon this thought till it became fixed in his mind 
 with singular firmness. It fired his soul with noble enthu- 
 siasm ; it gave elevation to his spirit ; it clothed his person 
 with dignity, and inspired his demeanor with loftiness. Thus 
 animated, he resolved to realize the truth of his great concep- 
 tion. Now came the test of his character. The idea itself 
 was grand, and its conception bespoke the possession of a 
 towering and glorious intellect. But, to make that concep- 
 tion a reality, to prove himself a true son of genius, and not 
 a mere romantic dreamer, required the exercise of such a 
 measure of faith, self-reliance, and enduring energy as is 
 seldom demanded of any man, even in the greatest of human 
 enterprises. 
 
 4. But Columbus felt equal to his work, and he set about 
 with a purpose to do it. How sublime does he appear in 
 his conflict with poverty, ridicule, and ignorance! The 
 announcement of his beloved idea was greeted with torrents 
 of derisive sarcasm, from prince and peasant, from learned 
 savans and stupid dunces. And it was only after the most 
 energetic, and long-continued perseverence, that he obtain- 
 ed the long-delayed means, and set sail on seas w r hose 
 waters had never before been cleaved by a vessel's prow\ 
 With what high and confident expectation did the adventur- 
 ous discoverer pass the boundaries of former navigation ! 
 With what patient zeal did he overcome the superstition 
 which made cow T ards of his mariners, and the ignorant envy 
 which very nearly converted them into mutineers ! By the 
 force of his own indomitable will alone, he soothed their 
 fears, and held them to their duties, till he proudly anchored 
 his vessels off the shores of the New World. And when 
 the haughty flag of Spain flaunted in the breezes of the

 Western Hemisphere, as the sign of its subjugation to the 
 crown of Isabella, it chiefly proclaimed the moral majesty 
 of that unconquerable energy through which the noble- 
 minded Columbus had singly defied the most formidable 
 obstacles, and revealed a hidden world to the wondering 
 eyes of mankind. 
 
 5. Are you, my friend, an aspirant after distinguished* 
 success ? Then you must diligently cultivate an untiring, 
 persisting, victorious energy, like that which gave Colum- 
 bus his renown. Is your lot lowly and your sphere very 
 limited? Are your difficulties apparently insurmountable? 
 What then ? Are you, therefore, to write yourself a noth- 
 ing, and remain a cipher in society? Nay! You must 
 rather bring an irresistible force of character to bear upon 
 every work of life. Be supine in nothing. Never despair 
 of success in any judicious enterprise. Resolve to accom- 
 plish whatever you undertake; and though you may not 
 discover a new world, like Columbus ; nor introduce man- 
 kind to the occult mysteries of nature, like Newton • nor 
 attain the wealth of Rothschild, or Astor; yet you may 
 climb to the summit of your profession, attain to honorable 
 distinction, and transmit to your posterity that most valu- 
 able of all bequests, a good name. — Daniel Wise. 
 
 BATTLE OF WATERLOO. 
 
 Observe that the last line of the first stanza, all of the second stanza, 
 and the quotation in the fourth, are examples of extraordinary 
 elocution, demanding an exercise of the imagination and imitation. 
 The last line in the first, demands a very low pitch ; the last line in 
 the second, a very high pitch ; the quotation in the fourth, an aspi- 
 rated tone, or intense whisper. Elevate the pitch and increase the

 emphasis, in the use of "nearer, clearer, deadlier," giving to "dead- 
 lier" the highest pitch and greatest emphasis. A part of the second, 
 and all of the fourth, demand fast time. As an elocutionary exercise, 
 this selection is interesting and important. Study it. 
 
 1. There was a sound of revelry by night, 
 
 And Belgium's capital had gathered there 
 Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright 
 
 The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men. 
 A thousand hearts beat happily ; and when 
 
 Music arose with its voluptuous swell, 
 Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again, 
 
 And all went merry as a marriage bell; 
 
 But hush ! hark ! — a deep sound strikes like a rising knell ! 
 
 2. Did you not hear it? ISTo; 'twas but the wind, 
 
 Or the car rattling o'er the stony street : 
 On with the dance ! let joy be unconfined ; 
 
 Xo sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet 
 To chase the glowing hours with flying feet — 
 
 But, hark ! — that heavy sound breaks in once more, 
 As if the clouds its echo w T ould repeat, 
 
 And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before ! 
 
 Arm ! Arm ! it is — it is the cannon's opening roar ! 
 
 3. Ah ! then and there was hurrying to and fro, 
 
 And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress, 
 And cheeks all pale, wdiich but an hour ago 
 
 Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness; 
 And there were sudden partings, such as press 
 
 The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs 
 Which ne'er might be repeated — who could guess 
 
 If ever more should meet those mutual eyes, 
 
 Since upon night so sw r eet, such awful morn could rise. 
 
 4. And there was mounting in hot haste ; the steed, 
 
 The mustering squadron, and the clattering car

 Went pouring forward with impetuous speed, 
 
 And swiftly forming in the ranks of war ; 
 And the deep thunder, peal on peal afar, 
 
 And near, the beat of the alarming drum 
 Roused up the soldier ere the morning star; 
 
 While thronged the citizens with terror dumb, 
 
 Or whispering with white lips — "The foe! They come! 
 They come !" — Byron. 
 
 VIRGINIA HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 
 
 This is an excellent exercise in transition, with respect to pitch. 
 The narrative of the author requires the lowest pitch ; the shouts of 
 "Treason," the highest. The language of Henry requires a medium 
 pitch, the orotund tone, fast time and strong force. Be careful to 
 change from one pitch to another, at the proper places. 
 
 In 1765, the famous Stamp Act was passed. It had long 
 been contemplated by the enemies of America, but no Brit- 
 ish statesman, up to this time, had ventured to urge its pas- 
 sage. * * The House of Burgesses of Virginia was in 
 session when the news arrived. Odious as the measure was, 
 there was danger in opposing it, and no one durst introduce 
 the subject. Patrick Henry was the youngest member. 
 After waiting in vain for older men to lead the way, he 
 hastily drew up on the blank leaf of an old law-book five 
 resolutions, which in strong terms asserted the rights of the 
 colonies, and denied the authority of Parliament to impose 
 taxes upon them. The reading of these resolutions pro- 
 duced unbounded consternation in the House. The Speaker 
 and many of the members were royalists, and a protracted 
 and violent debate followed. But the eloquence of Henry 
 bore down all opposition. Indignant at the attempt to in-

 thrall his country , the fearless orator, in the midst of an im- 
 passioned harangue, exclaimed, " Caesar had his Brutus, 
 Charles I. his Cromwell, and George III. — M "Treason!" 
 shouted the Speaker. " Treason ! Treason ! " was heard in 
 different parts of the House. "And George III.," repeated 
 Henry with flashing eye and unfaltering voice, " may profit 
 by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it." 
 Again the young mountaineer triumphed. The resolutions 
 were carried. They were circulated throughout the colonies, 
 and everywhere excited the same determined spirit that they 
 breathed. — Quackenbos. 
 
 A X INTR OD UCTOR Y ADDRESS. 
 
 This address is suitable for a school entertainment. A literary en- 
 tertainment at the close of a term, or the school year, is pleasant and 
 profitable to all concerned, if properly conducted. The teacher should 
 choose a pupil, who can declaim well, to present this exercise. 
 
 Respected Friends: — The occasion which has called 
 us together, at this time, is one of no ordinary interest. 
 Again we have the pleasure of meeting those who are dear 
 to us, not in the halls of mirth and gayety, not at the festive 
 board, not where political strife has a ruling sway over the 
 passions of man, but where youth, in their simplicity and 
 tenderness, meet to unfold the intellect, and cherish those 
 virtues which secure honor and happiness for the future. 
 
 Expect not, kind friends, that we have invited you here 
 to charm you with strains of eloquence, or to exhibit our- 
 selves as masters of the art of speaking, but merely to 
 witness the efforts, of those who are striving to make im- 
 provement. Long and hard have we labored, under the 
 guidance of our teacher, to acquire a store of knowledge

 that shall fit us for usefulness in after life. Much is due to 
 the kind and persevering efforts of our teacher, who has so 
 earnestly labored to bring before you so many who are willing 
 to take an active part in the exercises of this occasion ; and 
 we sincerely hope that what you may now witness will not 
 be wholly void of interest to you. 
 
 We feel that our privileges have been great, and, if we * 
 have not made improvement, we shall be obliged to confess 
 that we have been negligent of our duties, and inattentive 
 to the instructions of our teacher; for we are sure that 
 every reasonable effort has been made to advance us in the 
 path of usefulness and knowledge. But, we humbly trust, 
 that our time and our advantages have not been wholly mis- 
 improved, and that we shall, on this occasion, furnish some 
 evidence to show that we have accomplished something. 
 We would not, at this time, forget that kind Providence 
 which has watched ,over us during the past year, and which 
 has so highly favored us and our dear friends. While our 
 hearts are truly grateful for the continuance of life, and so 
 many of life's blessings, let us not forget that 
 
 We shall fade in our beauty, the fair and bright, 
 Like lamps that have served for a festal night ; 
 We shall fall from our spheres, the old and strong, 
 Like rose-leaves swept by the breeze along ; 
 The worshiped as gods in the olden day, 
 We shall be like a vain dream, — passing away. 
 Passing away ! sing the breeze and rill, 
 As they sweep on their course by vale and hill. 
 Through the varying scenes of each earthly clime, 
 'Tis the lesson of nature, the voice of time, 
 And man, at last, like his fathers gray, 
 Writes in his own dust, passing away. 
 
 — From Northend's American Speaker.

 CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE. 
 
 This celebrated charge was made October 25th, 1854, in the Crimean 
 War, while the Russian army on the one side, and the French and 
 English on the other, were encamped near Balaklava, a village on the 
 northern shore of the Black Sea. The charge was exceedingly daring 
 and reckless. It was the result of a misunderstanding of orders. Of 
 630 men composing the brigade, only 150 returned. 
 
 This demands a full, strong voice, and an animated style of 
 delivery. 
 
 1. Half a league, half a league, 
 Half a league onward, 
 
 All in the valley of Death 
 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 " Forward, the Light Brigade ! 
 Charge for the guns ! " he said : 
 Into the valley of Death 
 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 
 2. " Forward, the Light Brigade ! " 
 
 Was there a man dismayed ? 
 Not though the soldiers knew 
 
 Some one had blundered ! 
 Theirs not to make reply, 
 Theirs not to reason why, 
 Theirs but to do and die : 
 Into the valley of Death 
 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 
 3. Cannon to right of them, 
 Cannon to left of them, 
 Cannon in front of them, 
 
 Volleyed and thundered ;

 Stormed at with shot and shell, 
 Boldly they rode, and well ; 
 Into the jaws of Death, 
 Into the mouth of Hell, 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 
 4. Flashed all their sabres bare, 
 Flashed as they turned in air, 
 Sabering the gunners there, 
 Charging an army, while 
 
 All the world wondered : 
 Plunged in battery smoke, 
 Right through the line they broke; 
 Cossack and Russian 
 Reeled from the saber stroke, 
 Shattered and sundered. 
 Then they rode back — but not. 
 
 Not the six hundred. 
 
 5. Cannon to right of them, 
 Cannon to left of them, 
 Cannon behind them, 
 
 Volleyed and thundered; 
 Stormed at with shot and shell 
 While horse and hero fell, 
 They that had fought so well 
 Came through the jaws of Death, 
 Back from the mouth of Hell, 
 All that was left of them — 
 
 Left of six hundred. 
 
 6. When can their glory fade ! 
 Oh, the wild charge they made !

 ONE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE. 
 
 John Fitzpatrick, one of the Light Brigade, died of starvation in 
 England. He had received a pension of six pence a day, which, 
 however, was withdrawn several years ago, and he endeavored to eke 
 out a miserable existence by riding in circus pageants. Old age and 
 disease unfitted him for this or any other work ; the only refuge for 
 the disabled soldier was the poor-house, from which he shrank in 
 horror. The verdict of the Coroner's jury was, " Died of starvation, 
 and the case a disgrace to the War 06106." 
 
 1. Speed the news! Speed the news! 
 Speed the news onward ! 
 
 " Died of starvation " one 
 
 Of the six hundred ; 
 One who his part had played 
 Well in the Light Brigade, 
 When through the vale of Death 
 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 
 2. Food to the right of him, 
 Food to the left of him 
 Food all around, yet 
 
 The veteran hungered; 
 He who through shot and shell 
 Fearlessly rode, and well, 
 And when ordered to charge, 
 
 Shrank not nor lingered.

 Back in dismay he drew, 
 Feeling he never knew 
 
 When cannon thundered. 
 His not to plead, or sigh, 
 His but to starve and die, 
 And to a pauper's grave 
 Sink with a soul as brave 
 As through the vale of death 
 
 Rode the six hundred. 
 
 4. Flashed a proud spirit there, 
 Up through the man's despair, 
 Shaming the servile there ; 
 Scaring the timid, while 
 
 Sordid souls wondered ; 
 Then turned to face his fate 
 Calmly, with soul as great 
 As when through shot and shell 
 
 He rode with six hundred 
 With high hope elate, 
 Laughing in the face of fate — 
 
 Rode with six hundred. 
 
 5. Hunger his mate by day, 
 Sunday and working day, 
 Winter and summer day — 
 
 Shame on the nation ! 
 Struggling with might and main, 
 Smit by disease and pain, 
 He, in Victoria's reign, 
 " Died of starvation."

 THE WILD FOURTH OF JULY ORATOR. 
 
 A young man who had great confidence in his oratorical ability, was 
 invited to deliver a Fourth of July oration. His gesticulation was so 
 frequent and vehement, and his whole manner of expression so un- 
 becoming, that he gained the above appellation. This, it is claimed, 
 is a specimen of his oration. See Caution 3d. 
 
 Ladies and Gentlemen : — This is the ever adorable, 
 eommemorable, and patriotic Fourth of July. This is the 
 day when the American Eagle burst from his iron cage, 
 and, with a Yankee Doodle scream, pounced upon his af- 
 frighted tyrants and tore their despotic habiliments into a 
 thousand giblets. This, fellow citizens, is the Fourth day 
 of July — a day well worthy to be the first day of the year,

 and a day which shall be emblazoned on our latest country's 
 history, when all other days have sunk into oblivious non 
 compos mentis. This, fellow citizens, is the day when our 
 ancestral progenitors unanimously fought, died and bled, in 
 order that we and our children's children might cut their 
 own vine and fig tree, without daring to molest anybody, 
 nor make anybody afraid. This, I repeat, is the Fourth of - 
 July ; and who is there that can sit supinely downward on 
 this prognostic anniversary without reverting his mental 
 reminiscences to the great epochs of the Revolution — to the 
 blood-bespangled plains of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, and 
 Yorktown,and track the heroic heroes of those times through 
 trackless snows, and blood-stained deserts, to the eternal 
 mansions of the free trade and sailor's rights. This is the 
 day when we ought to think about the adorable privileges 
 and prerogatives that fall like heavenly dew upon every 
 American citizen, from the shores of Maine to the Gulf of 
 Mexico, and from the ocean to the inland seas. This is 
 when we ought to think about the blessings that stretch 
 away from the roaring Atlantic to the yellow banks of the 
 California, and where the jingling of the golden boulders 
 mixes up w T ith the screams of the catamount, and where the 
 mountain goat leaps from rock to rock, and — and — where — 
 and where — and I thank you for your attention. 
 
 THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
 
 It will add much to the effect, if a flag be placed in the proper po- 
 sition, and the declaimer address it. In the absence of a flag, the 
 declaimer should imagine that one is to his right, and look mainly in 
 that direction. This selection is of special importance to the student 
 of elocution, and, when properly rendered, is thrillingly interesting.

 The first stanza is descriptive, and is expressed ir. the past tense. 
 The others are dramatic and are addressed directly to the flag, consti- 
 tuting an example of extraordinary elocution. 
 
 1. When Freedom, from her mountain height, 
 
 Unfurled her standard to the air, 
 She tore the azure robe of night, 
 
 And set the stars of glory there ; 
 She mingled with its gorgeous dyes, 
 The milky baldrick of the skies, 
 And striped its pure, celestial white 
 With streakings of the morning light; 
 Then from his mansion in the sun, 
 She called her eagle bearer down. 
 And gave into his mighty hand 
 The symbol of her chosen land. 
 
 2. Majestic monarch of the cloud ! 
 
 Who rear'st aloft thy regal form, 
 To hear the tempest trumping loud, 
 And see the lightning lances driven, 
 
 Where strive the w r arriors of the storm, 
 And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven ! 
 Child of the sun ! to thee 'tis given 
 
 To guard the banner of the free, 
 To hover in the sulphur smoke, 
 To ward away the battle stroke, 
 And bid its blendings shine afar, 
 Like rainbows on the cloud of war, 
 
 The harbinger of victory.

 When speaks the signal-trumpet tone, 
 And the long line comes gleaming on ; 
 Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet, 
 Has dimmed the glistening bayonet, 
 Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn, 
 To where thy meteor glories burn, 
 And, as his springing steps advance, 
 Catch war and vengeance from the glance; 
 And when the cannon's mouthings loud 
 Heave, in wild wreaths, the battle shroud, 
 And gory sabers rise and fall, 
 Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall; 
 Then shall thy victor glances glow, 
 And cowering foes shall sink below 
 Each gallant arm, that strikes beneath 
 That awful messenger of death. 
 
 4. Flag of the seas ! on ocean's wave 
 Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave; 
 When death, careering on the gale, 
 Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail, 
 And frighted waves rush wildly back, 
 Before the broadside's reeling rack, 
 The dying wanderer of the sea 
 Shall look at once to heaven and thee, 
 And smile to see thy splendors fly 
 
 In triumph o'er his closing eye.

 By angel hands to valor given ; 
 Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, 
 And all thy hues were born in heaven.

 VALEDICTORY ADDRESS. 
 
 This address is peculiarly suitable for the last day of the school 
 year. I have frequently heard it rendered and accompanied by the 
 tears of parents, pupils and teachers. Observe that the first verse is 
 to be addressed to the visitors ; the second, to the teacher or teachers ; 
 the third, to the other pupils of the school. 
 
 1. We thank you, friends, who have come hither on this 
 occasion, to encourage and cheer us with your presence. 
 We thank you, who have gone so far and learned so much 
 on your journey of life, that you so kindly look back and 
 smile upon us, just setting out on our pilgrimage. We 
 thank you who have climbed so high up the Hill of Science, 
 that you condescend to pause a moment in your course, and 
 bestow a cheering, animating glance on us, who, almost in- 
 visible in the distance, are toiling over the roughness of the 
 first ascent. May you go on your way in peace, your path, 
 like the sun, waxing brighter and brighter till the perfect 
 day; and may the light of your example long linger in 
 blessings on those of us who shall survive to take your 
 places in the broad and busy world ! 
 
 2. We thank you, respected instructor, for your paternal 
 care, your faithful counsels, and affectionate instructions. 
 You have opened before us those ways of wisdom which 
 are full of pleasantness and peace. You have warned us

 of danger, when danger beset our path ; you have removed 
 obstacles, when obstacles impeded our progress; you have 
 corrected us when in error, and cheered us when discour- 
 aged. You have told us of the bright rewards of knowl- 
 edge and virtue, and of the fearful recompense of ignorance 
 and vice. In the name of my companions, I thank you — 
 warmly, sincerely thank you for it all. Our lips cannot, 
 express the gratitude that glows within our hearts; but we 
 will endeavor, with the blessing of Heaven, to testify it in 
 our future lives, by dedicating all that we are, and all that 
 we may attain, to the promotion of virtue and the good of 
 mankind. 
 
 3. And now, my beloved companions, I turn to you. 
 Long and happy has been our connection as members of 
 this school; but with this day it must close forever. No 
 longer shall we sit in these seats to listen to the voice that 
 woos us to be wise ; no more shall we sport together on the 
 noisy green, or wander in the silent grove. Other scenes, 
 other society, other pursuits, aw T ait us. We must part; but 
 parting shall only draw closer the ties that bind us. The 
 setting sun and the evening star, which have so often wit- 
 nessed our social intimacies and joys, shall still remind us 
 of the scenes that are past. While we live on the earth, 
 may we cherish a grateful remembrance of each other ; and, 
 Oli ! in Heaven, may our friendship be purified and per- 
 petuated! And now, to old and young, to patrons and 
 friends, to instructor and associates, w r e tender our reluctant 
 and affectionate farewell.

 DEATH OF LITTLE JO. 
 
 It is proper to remain seated while reading this. The language of 
 little Jo should be rendered in a very feeble tone, and the manner 
 should indicate great suffering, and finally, death. The thoughtful 
 student will readily see where transitions with respect to tone and 
 manner should be made. This selection is greatly appreciated by 
 persons of good taste. 
 
 Jo is very glad to see his old friend; and says, when 
 they are left alone, that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. 
 Sangsby should come so far out of his way on accounts of 
 sich as him. Mr. Sangsby, touched by the spectacle before 
 him, immediately lays upon the table half-a-crown, that 
 magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds. 
 
 "And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?" inquires 
 the stationer with his cough of sympathy. 
 
 "Fm in luck, Mr. Sangsby, I am," returns Jo, "and 
 do n't want for nothing. I feel better you can't think, Mr. 
 Sangsby. I'm wery sorry that I done it, but I didn't go 
 fur to do it, sir." 
 
 The stationer softly lays down another half-crown, and 
 asks him what it is that he is sorry for having clone. 
 
 " Mr. Sangsby," says Jo, " I went and giv' a illness to 
 the lady as wos here, and none of em never says nothing to 
 me for having done it. The lady come herself and see me 
 yes'day, and she ses, ' Ah, Jo ! ' she ses, c We thought we'd 
 lost you, Jo ! ' she ses. And Mr. Woodcot, he come fur to 
 give me something fur to ease me, and when he come a 
 bendin' over me and a speakin' up so bold, I see his tears a 
 fallin', Mr. Sangsby." 
 
 The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on 
 the table. Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible 
 remedy will relieve his feelings.

 "Wot I wos thinkin' on, Mr. Sangsby," proceeds Jo, 
 "wos, as you wos able to write wery large p'raps?" 
 
 " Yes, Jo, please God," returns the stationer. 
 
 " Uncommon precious large, p'raps?" says Jo, with 
 eagerness. 
 
 " Yes, my poor boy." 
 
 Jo laughs with pleasure. " Wot I was thinkin' on then, * 
 Mr. Sangsby, wos, that when I wos moved on as fur as 
 ever I could go, whether you might be so good, p'raps, as 
 to write out wery large, so as any one could see it, that I 
 wos truly hearty sorry that I done it ; and that I never 
 went fur to do it ; and that I hoped Mr. Woodcot would 
 be able to forgive me in his mind. If the writin' could say 
 it wery large, he might." 
 
 "It shall say it, Jo; very large." 
 
 Jo laughs again. " Thankee, Mr. Sangsby. It 's wery 
 kind in you, sir, and it makes me feel better I wos before." 
 
 The meek little stationer, with a broken and unfinished 
 cough, slips down his fourth half-crown. He has never 
 been so close to a case requiring so many, and is fain to de- 
 part. And Jo and he, upon this little earth, shall meet no 
 more. No more. 
 
 (Another Scene — Mr. Woodcourt Enters.) 
 
 " Well, Jo, what is the matter ? Don't be frightened." 
 
 " I thought," says Jo, who has started, and is looking 
 round, " I thought I wos at Tom Allan's again. Ain't 
 there nobody here but you, Mr. Woodcot ? " 
 
 "Nobody." 
 
 "And I ain't took back to Tom Allan's, am I, sir?" 
 
 " No." 
 
 Jo closes his eyes, muttering, " I am wery thankful." 
 
 After watching him closely a little while, Allan puts his

 mouth very near his ear, and says to him in a low, distinct 
 voice : " Jo, did you ever know a prayer?" 
 
 " Xever knowed nothing, sir." 
 
 " Not so much as one short prayer ? " 
 
 " No, sir. Nothing at all. Mr. Chadbands he was a 
 prayin' wunst at Mr. Sangsby's and I heerd him, but he 
 sounded as if he wos a speakin' to hisself, and not to me. 
 He prayed a lot, but /couldn't make out nothing on it. I 
 never knowed what it was all about." 
 
 It takes him a long time to say this ; and few but an ex- 
 perienced and attentive listener could hear, or hearing, un- 
 derstand him. After a short relapse into sleep or stupor, 
 he makes, of a sudden, a strong effort to get out of bed. 
 
 " Stay, Jo, stay ! What now ? " 
 
 u It's time for me to go to that berryin' ground, sir," he 
 returns with a w r ild look. 
 
 " Lie down, and tell me. What berrying ground, Jo ? " 
 
 " Where they laid him as was wery good to me ; wery 
 good indeed, he wos. It's time for me to go down to that 
 berryin' ground, sir, and ask to be put along side of him." 
 
 "By-and-by, Jo; by-and-by." 
 
 "Ah ! P'raps they wouldn't do it if I was to go myself. 
 But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid 
 by him." 
 
 "I will, indeed." 
 
 "Thankee, sir! Thankee, sir! They'll have to get the 
 key of the gate afore they can take me in, for it 's alius

 CRIMINALITY OF DUELING. 
 
 In 1804, Alexander Hamilton was challenged by Aaron Burr to 
 light a duel. These statesmen had for a long time been rivals in law 
 and politics, and Burr envied Hamilton's well deserved popularity. 
 Hamilton yielded to the force of public opinion and accepted the 
 challenge, but fired his pistol in the air, and was killed by his antag- 
 onist. " On the day of his funeral, the whole City of New York was 
 in mourning. On the steps of Trinity Church Governor Morris, with 
 the four sons of the deceased by his side, pronounced a solemn oration 
 in honor of his slaughtered friend. Speeches, sermons and poems 
 innumerable were composed in honor of Hamilton; towns and 
 villages in all parts of America were called after his name ; and never

 up to that time, since the death of Washington, had any event pro- 
 duced so universal an expression of sympathy on that continent, as 
 the untimely and lamented end of the great Federalist." — Reithmullcr. 
 
 1. Hamilton yielded to the force of an imperious cus- 
 tom; and yielding, he sacrificed a life in which all had an 
 interest; and he is lost, lost to his country, lost to his 
 family, lost to us. For this rash act, because he disclaimed 
 it, and was penitent, I forgive him. But there are those 
 whom I can not forgive. I mean not his antagonist, over 
 whose erring steps, if there be tears in heaven, a pious 
 mother looks down and weeps. 
 
 2. If he be capable of feeling, he suffers, already, all that 
 humanity can suffer : suffers, and wherever he may fly, will 
 suffer, with the poignant recollection of having taken the 
 life of one, who was too magnanimous in return to attempt 
 his own. If he had known this, it must have paralyzed his 
 arm while he pointed at so incorruptible a bosom, the in- 
 strument of death. Does he know this now, his heart, if it 
 be not adamant, must soften ; if it be not ice, it must melt. 
 * * But on this article I forbear. Stained w r ith blood 
 as he is, if he be penitent I forgive him ; and if he be not, 
 before these altars, where all of us appear as suppliants, I 
 wish not to excite your vengeance, but rather, in behalf of 
 an object rendered wretched and pitiable by crime, to wake 
 your prayers. 
 
 3. But I have said, and I repeat it, there are those whom 
 I can not forgive. I can not forgive that minister at the 
 altar, who has hitherto forborne to remonstrate on this sub- 
 ject. I can not forgive that public prosecutor, who, 
 intrusted with the duty of avenging his country's wrongs, 
 has seen these wrongs and taken no measures to avenge 
 them. I can not forgive that judge upon the bench, or that

 governor in the chair of State who has lightly passed over 
 such offenses. I can not forgive the public, in whose 
 opinion the duelist finds a sanctuary. I can not forgive 
 you, my brethren, who till this late hour have been silent, 
 while successive murders were committed. 
 
 4. No ; I can not forgive you, that you have not in com- 
 mon with the freemen of this state, raised your voice to the 
 powers that be, and loudly and explicitly demanded an ex- 
 ecution of your laws; demanded this in a manner, which, 
 if it did not reach the ear of government, would at least 
 have reached the heavens, and have pleaded your excuse 
 before the God that filleth them; in whose presence as I 
 stand, I should not feel myself innocent of the blood that 
 crieth against us, had I been silent. 
 
 5. But I have not been silent. Many of you who hear 
 me are my witnesses : the walls of yonder temple, where I 
 have heretofore addressed you, are my witnesses, how freely 
 I have animadverted on this subject, in the presence both 
 of those who have violated the law T s, and of those whose in- 
 dispensable duty it is to see the laws executed on those who 
 violate them. I enjoy another opportunity ; and would to 
 God, I might be permitted to approach for once the last 
 scene of death. Would to God, I could there assemble, on 
 the one side, the disconsolate mother with her seven father- 
 less children, and, on the other, those who administer the 
 justice of my country. Could I do this, I would point 
 them to these sad objects. 
 
 6. I would entreat them, by the agonies of bereaved 
 fondness, to listen to the widow's heart-felt groans; to 
 mark the orphans' sighs and tears ; and having done this, I 
 would uncover the breathless corpse of Hamilton ; I would 
 lift from his gaping wound his bloody mantle; I would

 hold it up to heaven before them, and I would ask, in the 
 name of God, I would ask, whether at the sight of it they 
 felt no compunction. Ye who have hearts of pity ; ye who 
 have experienced the anguish of dissolving friendship ; who 
 have wept, and still w T eep over the moldering ruins of 
 departed kindred, ye can enter into this reflection. 
 
 7. Oh, thou disconsolate widow! robbed, so cruelly 
 robbed, and in so short a time, both of a husband and a son! 
 what must be the plenitude of thy suffering ! Could we 
 approach thee, gladly would we drop the tear of sympathy, 
 and pour into thy bleeding bosom the balm of consolation ! 
 But how could we comfort her whom God hath not com- 
 forted ? To his throne let us lift up our voices and weep. 
 Oh God ! if thou art still the widow's husband, and 
 the father of the fatherless ; if in the fullness of thy good- 
 ness, there be yet mercy in store for miserable mortals, pity, 
 oh, pity this afflicted mother, and grant that her hapless 
 orphans may find a friend, a benefactor, a father in Thee. 
 
 —Dr. NotL 
 
 THE THREE BLACK CROWS. 
 
 A teacher once whipped a rebellious boy, and succeeded in securing 
 his obedience to the regulations of the school. The whipping, though 
 severe, was suitably administered, and the boy proceeded with his 
 duties. The next day it was currently reported on the streets, that 
 the boy was whipped with three whips plaited together, and that he 
 was so severely injured, that he had to be carried to his room. 
 
 A tew days after, the teacher had occasion to stop at a village, eight 
 miles from the school in which the whipping was done, when an 
 elderly lady inquired of him, " Did you hear about that teacher up at 
 "Winchester, who whipped a boy so terribly the other day ? They say 
 that he just beat the boy's back into a perfect jelly! And," said 
 she, " it must be so, for somebody told us that saw the boy's back."

 " Why Madam, I am the man who did that whipping ; I know all 
 about it." 
 
 " Why law me ! are you the fellow ? " 
 
 " I am." 
 
 " I'm glad you told me, for I might a said something I'd a wished 
 I hadn't." 
 
 Such exaggerated reports remind one of " The Three Black Crows." 
 
 1. Two honest tradesmen meeting in the Strand, 
 One took the other briskly by the hand ; 
 
 " Hark ye," said he, "'tis an odd story this, 
 About the crows!" — "I don't know what it is," 
 Replied his friend, "No! I'm surprised at that; 
 Where I come from it is the common chat. 
 But you shall hear : an odd affair indeed ! 
 And that it happened, they are all agreed. 
 Not to detain you from a thing so strange, 
 A gentleman, that lives not far from 'Change, 
 This week, in short, as all the alley knows, 
 Taking a puke, has thrown up three black crows." 
 
 " Impossible!" — "Nay but it's really true, 
 I had it from good hands, and so may you." 
 
 " From whose, I pray?" So, having named the man, 
 Straight to inquire, his curious comrade ran. 
 
 " Sir, did you tell?" — relating the affair; — 
 
 " Yes, sir, I did; and if it's worth your care, 
 Ask Mr. Such-a-one, he told it me ; 
 But, by the by, 't was two black crows, not three." 
 
 2. Resolved to trace so wondrous an event, 
 Whip to the third, the virtuoso went : 
 
 " Sir," — and-so-forth — " Why, yes ; the thing's a fact, 
 Though, in regard to number, not exact : 
 It was not two black crows, 't was only one ; 
 The truth of that you may depend upon ; 
 The gentleman himself told me the case."

 "Where may I find him?" "Why, in such a place." 
 Away he goes, and, having found him out — 
 
 " Sir, be so good as to resolve a doubt." 
 Then, to his last informant, he referred, 
 And begged to know if true what he had heard. 
 
 " Did you, sir, throw up a black crow T ?" "Not I!" 
 
 " Bless me ! how people propagate a lie ! 
 Black crows have been thrown up, three, two and one, 
 And here I find, at last, all comes to none ! 
 But did you say nothing of a crow at all?" 
 
 "Crow — crow — perhaps I might, now I recall 
 The matter over." " And pray, sir, what was 't?" 
 
 " Why, I was horrid sick, and, at the last, 
 I did throw up, and told my neighbor so, 
 Something, sir, that was as black as a crow."

 OVER THE RIVER. 
 
 One reason why some students do not succeed better in elocution, 
 is, they do not appreciate a really fine selection. At first sight, many 
 persons would not consider this selection worthy of careful attention. 
 I have heard a young lady declaim it, with very fine effect. At the 
 close of each stanza, the look should be upward, and the arms extend- 
 ed as if about to greet one who had passed "over the river." 
 
 1. Over the river they beckon to me — 
 
 Loved ones who ? ve crossed to the farther side; 
 The gleam of their snowy robes I see, 
 
 But their voices are drowned in the rushing tide. 
 There's one with ringlets of sunny gold, 
 
 And eyes the reflection of heaven's own blue ; 
 He crossed in the twilight gray and cold, 
 
 And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.

 We saw not the angels who met him there; 
 
 The gates of the city we could not see : 
 Over the river, over the river, 
 
 My brother stands ready to welcome me ! 
 
 2. Over the river the boatman pale 
 
 Carried another — the household pet : 
 Her brown curls w T aved in the gentle gale — 
 
 Darling Minnie ! I see her yet. 
 She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands, 
 
 And fearlessly entered the phantom bark; 
 We watched it glide from the silver sands, 
 
 And all our sunshine grew strangely dark. 
 We know she is safe on the farther side, 
 
 Where all the ransomed and angels be : 
 Over the river, the mystic river, 
 
 My childhood's idol is waiting for me. 
 
 3. For none return from those quiet shores 
 
 Who cross with the boatman cold and pale; 
 We hear the dip of the golden oars, 
 
 And catch a glQam of the snowy sail, 
 And lo ! they have passed from our yearning heart ; 
 
 They cross the stream, and are gone for aye ; 
 We may not sunder the vail apart 
 > That hides from our vision the gates of day. 
 
 We only know that their barks no more 
 
 May sail with us o'er life's stormy sea; 
 Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore 
 
 They watch, and beckon, and wait for me. 
 
 4. And I sit and think, when the sunset's gold 
 
 Is flushing river, and hill, and shore,

 I shall one day stand by the water cold, 
 
 And list for the sound of the boatman's oar. 
 L shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail; 
 
 I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand; 
 I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale 
 
 To the better shore of the spirit land ; 
 I shall know the loved who have gone before ; 
 
 And joyfully sweet will the meeting be, 
 When over the river, the peaceful river, 
 
 The Angel of Death shall carry me.

 I'VE DRANK MY LAST GLASS, BOYS. 
 
 The most difficult part of this selection, is, the language of the little 
 girl. The conclusion of each stanza should be accompanied by an em- 
 phatic gesture. 
 
 1. Xo, comrades, I thank you; 
 
 Not any for me. 
 My last chain is riven, 
 
 Henceforward Fm free. 
 J will go to my home 
 
 And my children to-night 
 With no fumes of liquor 
 
 Their spirits to blight ; 
 And, with tears in my eyes, 
 
 I'll beg my poor wife, 
 To forgive me the wreck i 
 
 Fve made of her life. 
 I've never refused you before, 
 
 Xow let that pass;

 For I've drank my last glass, boys; 
 I've drank my last glass. 
 
 2. Just look at me now, boys, 
 
 In rags and disgrace, 
 With my bleared, haggard eyes, 
 
 And red, bloated face. 
 Mark my faltering step 
 
 And my weak, palsied hand, 
 And the mark on my brow 
 
 That is worse than Cain's brand. 
 See my crownless old hat, 
 
 And my elbows and knees 
 Alike warmed by the sun 
 
 Or chilled by the breeze. 
 Why even the children 
 
 Will hoot as I pass, 
 But IVe drank my last glass, boys; 
 
 I've drank my last glass. 
 
 3. You'd hardly believe, boys, 
 
 To look at me now, 
 That a mother's soft hand 
 
 Was once pressed on my brow 
 When she kissed me and blessed me 
 
 Her darling, her pride, 
 Ere she laid down to rest 
 
 By my dead Father's side. 
 But with love in her eyes 
 
 She looked up to the sky, 
 Bidding me meet her there, 
 
 As she whispered " Good by," 
 And I'll do it, God helping.

 Your smile I let pass; 
 For I've drank my last glass, boys ;

 4. Ah ! I reeled home last night ; 
 
 It was not very late ; 
 For I'd spent my last six-pence, . 
 
 And landlords won't wait 
 On a poor fellow who's 
 
 Left every cent in their till, 
 And has pawned his last bed 
 
 Their coffers to fill. 
 Oh, the torments I felt ! 
 
 And the pangs I endured 
 As I begged for one glass ! 
 
 Just one would have cured. 
 But they kicked me out doors ! 
 
 I let that, too, pass ; 
 For I've drank my last glass, boys ; 
 
 I've drank my last glass. 
 
 5. At home, my pet Susie, 
 
 With her soft golden hair, 
 I saw through the window, 
 
 Just kneeling in prayer. 
 From her pale bony hands 
 
 Her torn sleeves were hung down, 
 And her feet, cold and bare, 
 
 Shrank beneath her scant gown. 
 And she prayed ! prayed for bread ! 
 
 For one crust, there on the bare floor, 
 My pet darling plead. 
 
 And I heard ! with no penny

 6. For Susie, my darling, 
 
 My wee six-year old, 
 Though fainting with hunger 
 
 And shivering with cold, 
 There on the bare floor 
 
 Asked God to bless me. 
 And she said, " Don't cry, mamma, 
 
 He will ; for you see 
 I believe what I ask for." 
 
 Then, sobered, I crept 
 Away from the house, and 
 
 That night, when I slept, 
 Next my heart lay the pledge — 
 
 You smile ; let it pass ; 
 For I've drank my last glass, boys; 
 
 I've drank by last glass. 
 
 7. My darling child saved me. 
 
 Her faith and her love 
 Are akin to my dear 
 
 Sainted mother's above. 
 I'll make her words true, 
 
 Or I'll die in the race, 
 And sober I'll go 
 
 To my last resting place. 
 And she shall kneel there 
 
 And, weeping, thank God, 
 No drunkard lies under 
 
 The daisy-strewn sod.

 THE NEW CHURCH ORGAN. 
 
 In reading this selection, the tone and manner of an elderly lady 
 are necessary. 
 
 1 . They've got a brand-new organ, Sue, 
 
 For all their fuss and search ; 
 They've done just as they said they'd do, 
 
 And fetched it into church. 
 They're bound the critter shall be seen, 
 
 And on the preacher's right 
 They've hoisted up their new machine, 
 
 In every body's sight. 
 They've got a chorister and choir, 
 
 Ag'in' my voice and vote ; 
 For it was never my desire, 
 
 To praise the Lord by note. 
 
 2. I've been a sister good and true 
 
 For five an' thirty year; 
 I've done what seemed my part to do, 
 
 An' prayed my duty clear; 
 I've sung the hymns both slow and quick, 
 
 Just as the preacher read, 
 And twice, when Deacon Tubbs w T as sick, 
 
 I took the fork an' led !

 And now, their bold, new-fangled ways, 
 
 Is comin' all about; 
 And I, right in my latter days, 
 
 Am fairly crowded out! 
 
 3. To-day the preacher, good old dear, 
 
 With tears all in his eyes, 
 Read, " I can read my title clear 
 
 To mansions in the skies." 
 I always liked that blessed hymn-^ 
 
 I s'pose I al'ays will ; 
 It somehow gratifies my whim, 
 
 In good old Ortonville ; 
 But when that choir got up to sing, 
 
 I couldn't catch a word ; 
 They sung the most dog-gondest thing 
 
 A body ever heard ! 
 
 4. Some worldly chaps was standin' near ; 
 
 An' when I see them grin, 
 I bid farewell to every fear, 
 
 And boldly waded in. 
 I thought I'd chase their tune along, 
 
 An' tried with all my might ; 
 But though my voice is good an' strong, 
 
 I could n't steer it right ; 
 When they was high, then I was low, 
 
 An' also contrawise; 
 An' I too fast, or they too slow, 
 
 To " mansions in the skies." 
 
 5. An' after every verse, you know, 
 
 They play a little tune ;

 I didn't understand, an' so 
 
 I started in too soon. 
 I pitched it pretty middlin' high, 
 
 I fetched a lusty tone, 
 But oh, alas ! I found that I 
 
 AVas singin' there alone ! 
 They laughed a little, I am told ; 
 
 But I had done my best ; 
 And not a wave of trouble rolled 
 
 Across my peaceful breast. 
 
 6. And Sister Brown — I could but look — 
 
 She sits right front of me ; 
 She never was no singin' -book. 
 
 An' never went to be ; 
 But then she al'ays tried to do 
 
 The best she could, she said; 
 She understood the time right through, 
 
 An' kep' it with her head; 
 But when she tried this mornin', oh, 
 
 I had to laugh or cough! 
 It kep' her head a bobbin' so, 
 
 It e'en a' most came off! 
 
 7. An' Deacon Tubbs — he all broke down, 
 
 As one might well suppose ; 
 He took one look at Sister Brown, 
 
 And meekly scratched his nose. 
 He looked his hymn-book through and through, 
 
 And laid it on the seat, 
 And then a pensive sigh he drew, 
 
 And looked completely beat.

 An' when they took another bout, 
 
 He didn't even rise ; 
 But drawed his red bandanner out, 
 
 An' wiped his weepin' eyes. 
 
 8. I've been a sister good an' true, 
 
 For five-an'-thirty year; 
 I've done what seemed my part to do, 
 
 An' prayed my duty clear; 
 But Death will stop my voice, I know, 
 
 For he is on my track ; 
 And some day I to church will go, 
 
 And never more come back ; 
 And when the folks gets up to sing — 
 
 When'er that time shall be — 
 I do not want no patent thing 
 
 A-squealin' over me !

 THE POWER OF HABIT. 
 
 This is a very profitable reading exercise. Observe the transitions 
 with respect to pitch, time, and manner. The last quotation requires 
 very fast time. 
 
 I remember once riding from Buffalo to Xiagara Falls. 
 I said to a gentleman, " What river is that, sir ? " 
 
 " That," said he, "is Xiagara River." 
 
 "Well, it is a beautiful stream," said I; "bright, and 
 fair, and glassy. How far off are the rapids ? " 
 
 " Only a mile or two," was the reply. 
 
 " Is it possible that only a mile from us we shall find the 
 water in the turbulence which it must show near the Falls?"

 " You will find so, sir." 
 
 And so I found it; and the first sight of Niagara I shall 
 never forget. 
 
 Now, launch your bark on that Niagara River; it is 
 bright, smooth, beautiful, and glassy. There is a ripple at 
 the bow; the silver wake you leave behind adds to your en- 
 joyment. Down the stream you glide, oars, sails, and helm 
 in proper trim, and you set out on your pleasure excursion. 
 Suddenly some one cries out from the bank, " Young men, 
 ahoy !" 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 " The rapids are below you!" 
 
 "Ha! ha! we have heard of the rapids, but we are not 
 such fools as to get there. If we go too fast, then we shall 
 up with the helm and, steer to the shore; we will set the 
 mast in the socket, hoist the sail, and speed to the land. 
 Then on, boys ! don't be alarmed ; there is no danger." 
 
 " Young men, ahoy there!" 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 " The rapids are below you!" 
 
 " Ha ! ha ! we will laugh and quaff; all things delight us. 
 What care we for the future ! No man ever saw it. Suf- 
 ficient for the day is the evil thereof. We will enjoy life 
 while we may — will catch pleasure as it flies. This is en- 
 joyment; time enough to steer out of danger when we are 
 sailing swiftly with the current." 
 
 " Young men, ahoy ! " 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 "Beware! Bew^are! The rapids are below you!" 
 
 " Now you see the water foaming all around. See how 
 fast you pass that point ! Up with the helm ! Now turn ! 
 Pull hard ! Quick ! quick ! quick ! pull for your lives !

 pull till the blood starts from your nostrils, and the veins 
 stand like whip-cords upon your brow! Set the mast in 
 the socket ! Hoist the sail ! Ah ! ah ! it is too late ! 
 Shrieking, howling, blaspheming, over they go." 
 
 Thousands go over the rapids of intemperance every 
 year, through the power of habit, crying all the while, 
 " When I find out that it is injuring me, I will give it up."

 THE NEWS OF A DAY. 
 
 1. "Great battle! Times extra !" the newsboy cried, 
 
 But it scarcely rippled the living tide 
 That ebbed and flowed in the busy street, 
 With its throbbing hearts and its restless feet. 
 Again through the hum of the city thrilled — 
 " Great battle ! Times extra ! Ten thousand killed ! " 
 And the little carrier hurried away 
 With the sorrowful news of that winter day. 
 
 2. To a dreary room in the attic high 
 Trembled the words of that small, sharp cry, 
 And a lonely widow bowed down her head 
 And murmured, "Willie — my Willie is dead! 
 Oh, I feared it was not an idle dream 
 
 That led me, last night, to that deep, dark stream, 
 Where the ground was wet with a crimson rain, 
 And strewn all over with ghastly slain ! 
 The stars were dim, for the night was wild, 
 But I threaded the gloom till I found my child.

 Of the sudden blow and the quick, sharp pain, 
 But a little wound and a purple stain. 
 I tried to speak, but my voice was gone, 
 And my soul stood there in the cold gray dawn 
 Till they rifled his body with ruthless hand, 
 And covered him up with the reeking sand. 
 
 4. " Willie! oh, Willie! it seems but a day 
 
 Since thy baby-head on my bosom lay — 
 Since I heard thy prattle so soft and sweet, 
 And guided the steps of thy tottering feet; 
 And thou wert the fairest and last of three 
 That the Father in heaven had given to me. 
 All the life of my heart — love, hope, and joy — 
 Were treasured in thee, my strong, brave boy ; 
 And the last faint words thy father said 
 Were, ' Willie will mind thee when I am dead.' 
 But they tore the flag from thy death-cold hand, 
 And covered thee up in the reeking sand." 
 
 5. She read the names of the missing and slain, 
 But one she read over again and again ; 
 
 And the sad, low words that her white lips said 
 Were, " Company C, William Warren, — dead." 
 The world toiled on through the busy street, 
 With its aching hearts and unresting feet ; 
 The night came down to her cold hearth-stone, 
 And she still read on in the same low tone ; 
 And still the words that her white lips said 
 Were, " Company C, William Warren — dead." 
 
 6. The light of the morning chased the gloom 
 From the emberless hearth of that attic room, 
 And the city's pulses throbbed again, 
 
 But the mother's heart had forgotten its pain.

 She had gone through the gates to the better land 
 With that terrible list in her pale, cold hand —

 THE CHARCOAL MAN. 
 
 1. Though rudely blows the wintry blast, 
 And sifting snows fall w T hite and fast, 
 Mark Haley drives along the street, 
 Perched high upon his wagon seat ; 
 His sombre face the storm defies, 
 
 And thus from morn till eve he cries, — 
 
 "Charco'! charco'!" 
 While echo faint and far replies, — 
 
 "Hark,0! hark, O!" 
 "Charco'!"— "Hark, O!"— Such cheery sounds 
 Attend him on his daily rounds. 
 
 2. The dust begrimes his ancient hat ; 
 His coat is darker far than that; 
 'Tis odd to see his sooty form 
 
 All speckled with the feathery storm ; 
 
 Yet in his honest bosom lies 
 
 Nor spot, nor speck, — Though still he cries, — 
 
 ' 'Charco'! charco'!" 
 And many a roguish lad replies, — 
 
 "Ark, ho! ark, ho!" 
 "CharcoM" — "Ark, ho!" — Such various sounds 
 Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds. 
 
 3. Thus all the cold and wintry day 
 He labors much for little pay ;

 Yet feels no less of happiness 
 Than many a richer man, I guess, 
 When through the shades of eve he spies 
 The light of his own home, and cries, — 
 
 "Charco'! charco'!" 
 And Martha from the door replies, — 
 
 "Mark, ho! Mark, ho!" 
 "Charco'!"— "Mark, ho!"— Such joy abounds 
 When he has closed his daily rounds. 
 
 4. The hearth is warm, the fire is bright ; 
 
 And while his hand, washed clean and white, 
 Holds Martha's tender hands once more, 
 His glowing face bends fondly o'er 
 The crib wherein his darling lies, 
 And in a coaxing tone he cries 
 
 " Charco'! charco'!" 
 And baby with a laugh replies, — 
 
 "Ah, go! ah, go!" 
 " Charco' P— "Ah, go 1"— While at the sounds 
 The mother's heart with gladness bounds. 
 
 5. Then honored be the charcoal man ! 
 Though dusty as an African, 
 
 'Tis not for you, that chance to be 
 A little better clad than he, 
 His honest manhood to despise, 
 Although from morn till eve he cries, — 
 
 " Charco' ! charco'!" 
 While mocking echo still replies, — 
 "Hark, O! harkO!" 
 "Charco'!"— "Hark, O !"— Long may the sounds 
 Proclaim Mark Haley's daily rounds !

 EXPERIENCE WITH EUROPEAN GUIDES. 
 
 European guides know about enough English to tangle 
 everything up so that a man can make neither head nor tail 
 of it. They know their story by heart, — the history of 
 every statue, painting, cathedral, or other wonder they 
 show you. They know it and tell it as a parrot would, and 
 if you interrupt and throw them off the track, they have to 
 go back and begin over again. All their lives long they 
 are employed in showing strange things to foreigners and 
 listening to their bursts of admiration. 
 
 It is human nature to take delight in exciting admiration. 
 It is what prompts children to say "smart" things and do 
 absurd ones, and in other ways " show off" w^hen company 
 is present. It is what makes gossips turn out in rain and 
 storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news. 
 Think, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose 
 privilege it is, every day, to show to strangers wonders that 
 throw them into perfect ecstacies of admiration ! He gets 
 so that he could not by any possibility live in a soberer at- 
 mosphere. 
 
 After we discovered this, we never went into ecstacies any 
 more, — we never admired anything, — we never showed any 
 but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence 
 of the sublimest wonders a guide had to display. We had 
 found their weak point. We have made good use of it ever 
 since. We have made some of those people savage at 
 times, but we have never lost our serenity. 
 
 The doctor asks the questions generally, because he can 
 keep his countenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, 
 and throw more imbecility into the tone of his voice than 
 any man that lives. It comes natural to him.

 The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American 
 party, because Americans so much wonder, and deal so 
 much in sentiment and emotion before any relic of Colum- 
 bus. Our guide there fidgeted about as if he had swal- 
 lowed a spring mattress. He was full of animation, — full 
 of impatience. He said: "Come wis me, genteelmen ! 
 come ! I show you ze letter writing by Christopher Colum- 
 bo ! write it himself! write it wis his own hand ! come! " 
 
 He took us to the municipal palace. After much im- 
 pressive fumbling of keys and opening of locks, the stained 
 and aged document was spread before us. The guide's eyes 
 sparkled. He danced about us and tapped the parchment 
 with his finger: — 
 
 "What I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! 
 handwriting Christopher Columbo ! write it himself!" 
 
 We looked indifferent, — unconcerned. The doctor ex- 
 amined the document very deliberately, during a painful 
 pause. Then he said, without any show of interest, — 
 
 "Ah, Ferguson, what, — what did you say was the name 
 of the party who w T rote this?" 
 
 " Christopher Columbo ! ze great Christopher Columbo ! " 
 
 Another deliberate examination. 
 
 "Ah! did he write it himself, or, — or how?" 
 
 "He write himself! Christopher Columbo! he's own 
 handwriting, write by himself!" 
 
 Then the doctor laid the document down and said, "Why, 
 I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that 
 could write better than that." 
 
 " But zis is ze great Christo — " 
 
 " I don't care who it is ! It's the worst writing I ever 
 saw. Now you must n't think you can impose on us be- 
 cause we are strangers. We are not fools, by a good deal.

 If you have got any specimens of penmanship of real 
 merit, trot them out ! and if you haven't, drive on ! " 
 
 We drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, 
 but he made one more venture. He had something which 
 he thought would overcome us. He said : 
 
 "Ah, genteelmen, you come wis us! I show you beauti- 
 ful, oh, magnificent bust Christopher Columbo! splendid, 
 grand, magnificent ! " 
 
 He brought us before the beautiful bust, — for it was 
 beautiful, — and sprang back and struck an attitude. 
 
 "Ah, look, genteelmen ! beautiful, grand, bust Christo- 
 pher Columbo ! beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal ! " 
 
 The doctor put up his eye-glass, procured for such occa- 
 sions. 
 
 "Ah, what did you say this gentleman's name was?" 
 
 " Christopher Columbo ! ze great Christopher Columbo !" 
 
 " Christopher Columbo, — the great Christopher Colum- 
 bo. Well, what did he do ? " 
 • " Discover America ! discover America — oh, zediable ! " 
 
 " Discover America ? No, that statement will hardly 
 wash. We are just from America ourselves. Christopher 
 Columbo, — pleasant name. Is — is he dead?" 
 
 " Oh, corpo di Baccho ! three hundred year ! " 
 
 "What did he die of?" 
 
 " I do not know. I can not tell." 
 
 "Small-pox, think?" 
 
 "I do not know, genteelmen, — I do not know wkf he 
 die of." 
 
 "Measles, likely?" 
 
 " Maybe, — maybe. I do not know, — I think he die of 
 something." 
 
 "Parents living?"

 " Irn-posseeble ! " 
 
 "Ah, — which is the bust and which is the pedestal?" 
 
 " Santa Maria ! zis ze bust ! — zis ze pedestal!" 
 
 "Ah, I see, I see, — happy combination, very happy com- 
 bination, indeed. Is — is this the first time this gentleman 
 was ever on a bust ? " 
 
 That joke was lost on the foreigner, — guides can not 
 master the subtleties of the American joke. 
 
 We have made it interesting for this Roman guide. 
 Yesterday we spent three or four hours in the Vatican 
 again, that wonderful world of curiosities. We came very 
 near expressing interest sometimes, even admiration. It 
 was hard to keep from it. We succeeded, though. Xo- 
 body else ever did in the Vatican museums. The guide 
 was bewildered, — nonplussed. He walked his legs off, 
 nearly, hunting up extraordinary things, and exhausted all 
 his ingenuity on us, but it was all a failure; we never 
 showed any interest in anything. He had reserved what he 
 considered to be his greatest wonder till the last, — a royal 
 Egyptian mummy, the best preserved in the world, per- 
 haps. He took us there. He felt so sure this time, that 
 some of his old enthusiasm came back to him : — 
 
 " See, genteelmen ! Mummy ! Mummy ! " 
 
 The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever. 
 
 "Ah, Ferguson, what did I understand you to say the 
 gentleman's name was ? " 
 
 " Xame ? He got no name ! Mummy ! 'Gyptian 
 mummy ! " 
 
 " Yes, yes. Born here ? " 
 
 a ?so. 'Gyptian mummy," 
 
 " Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume ? w 
 
 " Xo ! Not Frenchman, not Roman ! Born in Egypta !"

 " Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. For- 
 eign locality, likely. Mummy, mummy. How calm he is, 
 how self possessed ! Is — ah ! — is he dead ? " 
 
 " Oh, sacre bleu! been dead three thousan' year' ! " 
 
 The doctor turned on him savagely: — 
 
 " Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this? 
 Playing us for Chinamen, because we are strangers and 
 trying to learn ! Trying to impose your vile second-hand 
 carcasses on us! Thunder and lightning ! I've a notion to 
 — to — if you've got a nice, fresh corpse fetch him out ! — 
 or we '11 brain you ! " 
 
 However, he has paid us back partly, and without know- 
 ing it. He came to the hotel this morning to ask if we 
 were up, and he endeavored, as well as he could, to describe 
 us, so that the landlord would know which persons he 
 meant. He finished with the casual remark that we were 
 lunatics. The observation was so innocent and so honest 
 that it amounted to a very good thing for a guide to say. 
 
 Our Eoman Ferguson is the most patient, unsuspecting, 
 long-suffering subject we have had yet. We shall be sorry 
 to part with him. We have enjoyed his society very much. 
 We trust he has enjoyed ours, but we are harrassed with 
 doubts.— Mark Tivain. 
 
 THE RUM MANIAC. 
 
 This and the following selection are examples of exceedingly difficult 
 personation. 
 
 1. " Say, Doctor, may I not have rum, 
 
 To quench this burning thirst within? 
 Here on this cursed bed I lie, 
 
 And can not get one drop of gin.

 I ask not health, or even life — 
 
 Life ! what a curse it's been to me ! 
 
 Fd rather sink in deepest hell, 
 Than drink again its misery. 
 
 2. " But, Doctor, may i not have rum ? 
 
 One drop alone is all I crave : 
 Grant this small boon — I ask no more — 
 
 Then I'll defy — yes e'en the grave; 
 Then, without fear, I'll fold by arms, 
 
 And bid the monster strike his dart, 
 To haste me from this world of woe, 
 
 And claim his own — this ruined heart. 
 
 3. " A thousand curses on his head 
 
 Who gave me first the poisoned bowl, 
 Who taught me first this bane to drink — 
 
 Drink — death and ruin to my soul. 
 My soul ! oh cruel, horrid thought ! 
 
 Full well I know thy certain fate ; 
 With what instinctive horror shrinks 
 
 The spirit from that awful state ! 
 
 4. " Lost — lost — I know forever lost ! 
 
 To me no ray of hope can come : 
 My fate is sealed ; my doom is — 
 
 But give me rum ; I will have rum. 
 But Doctor, don't you see him there ? 
 
 In that dark corner low he sits ; 
 See ! how he sports his fiery tongue, 
 
 And at me burning brimstone spits ! 
 
 5. " Say, don't you see this demon fierce? 
 
 Does no one hear ? will no one come ?

 Oh save me — save me — I will give — 
 But rum ! I must have — will have rum ! 
 
 Ah ! now he's gone ; once more I'm free : 
 He — the boasting knave and liar — 
 
 He said that he would take me off 
 
 Down to — But th£re ! my bed's on fire ! 
 
 6. " Fire ! water! help! come, haste — I'll die ; 
 
 Come, take me from this burning bed : 
 The smoke — I'm choking — can not cry; 
 
 There now — it's catching at my head! 
 But see ! again that demon's come ; 
 
 Look ! there he peeps through yonder crack ; 
 Mark how his burning eye-balls flash ! 
 
 How fierce he grins ! what brought him back ? 
 
 7. " There stands his burning coach of fire; 
 
 He smiles and beckons me to come — 
 What are those words he's written there ? 
 
 i In hell, we never want for rum ! ' " 
 One loud, one piercing shriek was heard ; 
 
 One yell rang out upon the air; 
 One sound, and one alone, came forth — 
 
 The victim's cry of wild despair. 
 
 8. " Why longer wait? I'm ripe for hell; 
 
 A spirit's sent to bear me down ; 
 There, in the regions of the lost, 
 
 I sure will wear a fiery crown. 
 Damned, I know, without a hope ! — 
 
 One moment more, and then I'll come ! — 
 And there I'll quench my awful thirst 
 
 With boiling, burning, fiery rum ! "

 The person declaiming this, should remain standing until he says, 
 " Lay me down in this hollow;" he should then be seated until he 
 comes to the part to be sung; while singing the quoted stanza, be 
 should stand, clasp the hands as in prayer, and look upward. He 
 should again be seated while rendering the last stanza. To secure a 
 deathly expression, the look must be vacant, and the eyeballs frequent-

 Keep your arms ready !

 Speak lowly !

 Lay me down in this hollow ; 
 
 We are out of the strife.

 When they came down the hill over sloughing and sand ? 
 But we stood — did we not — like immovable rock, 
 Unheeding their balls and repelling their shock? 
 
 Did you mind the loud cry, 
 
 When, as turning to fly, 
 Our men sprang upon them, determined to die ? 
 
 Oh, wasn't it grand ? 
 
 4. God help the poor wretches that fell in the fight ; 
 No time was there given for prayer or for flight. 
 They fell by the score, in the crash, hand-to-hand, 
 
 And they mingled their blood with the sloughing and sand. 
 Great heavens ! this bullet-hole gapes like a grave, 
 A curse on the aim of the treacherous knave ! 
 Is there never a one of you knows how to pray, 
 Or speak for a man as his life ebbs away? 
 
 Pray! pray! 
 Our Father! Our Father ! Why don't you proceed? 
 Can't you see I am dying ! Great God, how I bleed ! 
 Ebbing away ! ebbing away ! 
 The light of day is turning to gray. 
 
 Pray! pray! 
 Our Father in Heaven — boys, tell me the rest, 
 While I staunch the hot blood from this hole in my breast. 
 There's something about forgiveness of sin — 
 Put that in ! put that in ! and then 
 I'll follow your words and say an amen.

 And Wilson, my comrade — oh, was n't it grand,

 And were scattered like dust by our brave little crowd ? 
 Can't you say a short prayer for the dying and dead ?

 And quiet all his fierce alarms."

 It is light to my path when my sight has grown dim,

 "ROCK OF ages:' 
 
 1. " Rock of ages cleft for me," 
 
 Thoughtlessly the maiden sung; 
 Fell the words unconsciously 
 
 From her girlish, gleeful tongue; 
 Sang as little children sing ; 
 
 Sang as sing the birds in June ; 
 Fell the words like light leaves down 
 
 On the current of the tune — 
 " Rock of ages, cleft for me 
 
 Let me hide myself in Thee." 
 
 2. " Let me hide myself in Thee " — 
 
 Felt her soul no need to hide. 
 Sweet the song as song could be, 
 And she had no thought beside ;

 All the words unheedingly 
 
 Fell from lips untouched by care, 
 
 Dreaming not that they might be 
 On some other lips a prayer : 
 " Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 
 Let me hide myself in Thee." 
 
 3. " Rock of ages, cleft for me," — 
 
 ; Twas a woman sung them now, 
 Pleadingly and prayerfully ; 
 
 Everv word her heart did know. 
 Rose the song as storm-tossed bird 
 
 Beats with weary wing the air, 
 Every note with sorrow stirred, 
 
 Every syllable a prayer: 
 " Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee ! " 
 
 4. " Rock of ages, cleft for me," — 
 
 Lips grown aged sung the hymn, 
 Trustingly and tenderly, 
 
 Voice grown weak and eyes grown dim- 
 " Let me hide myself in Thee," 
 
 Trembling though the voice and low, 
 Ran the sweet strain peacefully, 
 
 Like a river in its flow ; 
 Sang as only they can, sing 
 
 Who life's thorny path have prest; 
 Sang as only they can sing 
 
 Who behold the promised rest : — 
 " Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee."

 " Rock of ages, cleft for me," — 
 
 Sung above a coffin-lid ; 
 Underneath, all restfully, 
 
 All life's joys and sorrows hid; 
 Nevermore, O storm-tossed soul ! 
 
 Nevermore from wind or tide, 
 Nevermore from billow's roll 
 
 Wilt thou need thyself to hide. 
 Could the sightless, sunken eyes, 
 
 Closed beneath the soft gray hair, 
 Could the mute and stiffened lips 
 
 Move again in pleading prayer, 
 Still, aye, still, the words would be,

 NO SECT IN HEAVEN. 
 
 Talking of sects till late one eve, 
 Of the various doctrines the saints believe, 
 That night I stood in a troubled dream, 
 By the side of a darkly-flowing stream. 
 
 And a " Churchman" down to the river came, 
 When I heard a strange voice call his name, 
 u Good father, stop ; when you cross this tide, 
 You must leave your robes on the other side." 
 
 But the aged father did not mind, 
 And his long gown floated out behind, 
 As down to the stream his way he took, 
 His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book.

 " I'm bound for Heaven, and when Fm there 
 I shall want my book of Common Prayer; 
 And though I put on a starry crown, 
 I should feel quite lost without my gown." 
 
 Then he fixed his eyes on the shining track, 
 But his gown was heavy, and held him back ; 
 And the poor old father tried in vain 
 A single step in the flood to gain. 
 
 I saw him again on the other side, 
 But his silk gown floated on the tide; 
 And no one asked in that blissful spot, 
 Whether he belonged to " the Church " or not. 
 
 When down to the river a Quaker strayed, 
 His dress of a sober hue was made ; 
 " My coat and hat must be all gray, 
 I can not go any other way." 
 
 Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin, 
 And steadily, solemnly, waded in, 
 And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight 
 Over his forehead, so cold and white. 
 
 But a strong wind carried away his hat, 
 A moment he silently sighed over that, 
 And then, as he gazed on the farther shore, 
 The coat, slipped off, and was seen no more. 
 
 As he entered Heaven, his suit of gray 
 Went quietly sailing away, away, 
 And none of the angels questioned him 
 About the w r idth of his beaver's brim.

 Next came Dr. Watts with a bundle of Psalms, 
 
 Tied nicely up in his aged arms, 
 
 And hymns as many, a very wise thing, 
 
 That the people in Heaven, " all round," might sing. 
 
 But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh, 
 As he saw that the river ran broad and high, 
 And looked rather surprised as, one by one, 
 The Psalms and Hymns in the waves went down. 
 
 And after him with his MSS., 
 
 Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness ; 
 
 But he cried, " Dear me, w T hat shall I do? 
 
 The water has soaked them through and through." 
 
 And there on the river, far and wide, 
 Away they went down the swollen tide, 
 And the saint astonished passed through alone, 
 Without his manuscripts up to the throne. 
 
 Then gravely walking, two saints by name, 
 Down to the stream together came ; 
 But as they stopped at the river's brink, 
 I saw one saint from the other shrink. 
 
 " Sprinkled or plunged, may I ask you, friend, 
 
 How you attained to life's great end ? " 
 " Thus, with a few drops on my brow," 
 " But I have been dipped as you see me now. 
 
 a 
 
 And I really think it will hardly do, 
 As I'm ' close communion/ to cross with you ; 
 You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss, 
 But you must go that way, and I'll go this."

 Then straightway plunging with all his might, 
 Away to the left — his friend at the right, 
 Apart they went from this world of sin, 
 But at last together they entered in. 
 
 And, now, when the river is rolling on, 
 
 A Presbyterian Church went dow T n ; 
 
 Of women there seemed an innumerable throng, 
 
 But the men I could count as they passed along. 
 
 And concerning the road, they could never agree, 
 The old or the new way, which it could be, 
 Nor even a moment paused to think 
 That both would lead to the river's brink. 
 
 And a sound of murmuring long and loud 
 Came ever up from the moving crowd, 
 " You're in the old way, and I'm in the new ; 
 That is the false, and this is the true ; " 
 Or, " I'm in the old way, and you're in the new; 
 That is the false, and this is the true." 
 
 But the brethren only seemed to speak, 
 Modest the sisters walked, and meek, 
 And if ever one of them chanced to say 
 What troubles she met with on the way, 
 How she longed to pass to the other side, 
 Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide, 
 A voice arose from the brethren then : 
 " Let no one speak but the i holy men ;' 
 
 For have ye not heard of the words of Paul, 
 i O let the women keep silence all ?' "

 I watched them long in my furious dream, 
 
 Till they stood by the borders of the stream, 
 
 Then, just as I thought, the two ways met, 
 
 But all the brethren were talking yet, 
 
 And would talk on, till the heaving tide 
 
 Carried them over side by side; 
 
 Side by side, for the way was one ; 
 
 The toilsome journey of life was done, 
 
 And all who in Christ the Saviour died, 
 
 Came out alike on the other side : 
 
 No forms, or crosses, or books had they, 
 
 Xo gowns of silk, or suits of gray, 
 
 No creeds to guide them, or MSS., 
 
 For all had put on Christ's righteousness.

 " BORROBOOLA GHA." 
 
 1. A stranger preached last Sunday, 
 
 And crowds of people came . 
 To hear a two-hour sermon 
 
 With a barbarous sounding name. 
 'Twas all about some heathens 
 
 Thousands of miles afar, 
 Who lived in a land of darkness, 
 
 Called Borroboola Gha. 
 
 2. So icell their wants he pictured, 
 
 That, when the plates were passed, 
 Each listener felt his pockets, 
 And goodly sums were cast;

 For all must lend a shoulder 
 
 To push a rolling car 
 That carries light and comfort 
 
 To"BorroboolaGha." 
 
 3. That night their wants and sorrows 
 
 Lay heavy on my soul, 
 And deep in meditation 
 
 I took my morning stroll, 
 Till something caught my mantle 
 
 With eager grasp and wild, 
 And, looking down with wonder, 
 
 I saw a little child — 
 
 4. A pale and puny creature, 
 
 In rags and dirt forlorn. 
 What could she want? I questioned, 
 
 Impatient to be gone. 
 With trembling voice she answered, 
 " We live just down the street, 
 And mammy she's a dyin', 
 
 And we've nothin' left to eat." 
 
 5. Down in a wretched basement, 
 
 With mould upon the walls, 
 Through whose half-buried windows 
 
 God's sunshine never falls — 
 Where cold, and want, and hunger 
 
 Crouched near her as she lay, 
 I found a fellow creature 
 
 Gasping her life away. 
 
 6. A chair, a broken table, 
 
 A bed of dirty straw,

 A hearth all dark and cheerless — 
 
 But these I scarcely saw 
 For the mournful sight before me — 
 
 The sad and sickening show. 
 Oh, never had I pictured 
 
 A scene so full of woe. 
 
 The famished and the naked, 
 
 The babes that pined for bread, 
 The squalid group that huddled 
 
 Around the dying bed — 
 All this distress and sorrow 
 
 Should be in lands afar : 
 Was I suddenly transplanted 
 
 To a BorroboolaGha?" 
 
 Ah ! no ; the poor and wretched 
 
 Were close behind the door, 
 And I had passed them heedless 
 
 A thousand times before. 
 Alas! for the cold and hungry 
 
 That meet me every day, 
 While all my tears were given 
 
 To the suffering far away. 
 
 There's work enough for Christians 
 
 In distant lands, we know; 
 Our Lord commands his servants 
 
 Through all the world to go. 
 Not only for the heathen, 
 
 This was the charge to them : 
 " Go preach the Word, beginning 
 
 First at Jerusalem."

 10. Oh, Christian, God has promised 
 
 Whoe'er to thee has given 
 A cup of pure cold water 
 
 Shall find reward in heaven. 
 Would you secure the blessing,

 Go find in yonder hovel 
 
 A " Borroboola Gha." 
 
 "CURFEW MUST NOT RING TO-NIGHT." 
 
 Slowly England's sun was setting o'er the hilltops far away, 
 Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day, 
 And the last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden fair, — 
 He with footsteps slow and weary, she with sunny, floating hair ; 
 He w T ith bowed head, sad and thoughtful, she with lips all cold and 
 
 white, 
 Struggled to keep back the murmer, — 
 
 " Curfew must not ring to-night." 
 
 "Sexton," Bessie's white lips faltered, pointing to the prison old, 
 
 With its turrets tall and gloomy, w r ith its walls dark, damp, and cold, 
 "I've a lover in that prison, doomed this very night to die, 
 At the ringing of the curfew — and no earthly help is nigh ; 
 Cromwell will not come till sunset," and her lips grew strangely 
 
 white 
 As she breathed the husky whisper, — 
 
 " Curfew must not ring to-night." 
 
 " Bessie," calmly spoke the sexton, every word pierced her young heart 
 
 Like the piercing of an arrow, like a deadly, poisoned dart, 
 "Long, long years I've rung the curfew from that gloomy, shadowed 
 tower ; 
 Every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight hour; 
 I have done my duty ever, tried to do it just and right, 
 Now I'm old I still must do it, 
 
 Curfew it must ring to-night."

 Wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thoughtful 
 
 brow, 
 And within her secret bosom Bessie made a solemn vow. 
 She had listened while the judges read without a tear or sigh, 
 'At the ringing of the curfew, Basil Underwood must die." 
 And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and 
 
 bright — 
 In an undertone she murmured, — 
 
 " Curfew must not ring to-night." 
 
 She with quick steps bounded forward, sprung within the old church 
 
 door, 
 Left the old man treading slowly paths so oft he'd trod before; 
 Not one moment paused the maiden, but w T ith eye and cheek aglow, 
 Mounted up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro ; 
 And she climbed the dusty ladder on which fell no ray of light, 
 Up and up — her white lips saying — 
 
 " Curfew shall not ring to-night." 
 
 She has reached the topmost ladder, o'er her hangs the great, dark 
 
 bell; 
 Awful is the gloom beneath her, like a pathway down to hell. 
 Lo, the ponderous tongue is swinging, 'tis the hour of curfew now. 
 And the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath, and paled 
 
 her brow. 
 Shall she let it ring? No, never! Flash her eyes with sudden light, 
 And she springs and grasps it firmly — 
 
 " Curfew shall not ring to-night." 
 
 Out she swung, far out, the city seemed a speck of light below, 
 'Twixt heaven and earth her form suspended, as the bell swung to 
 
 and fro, 
 And the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell, 
 But he thought it still was ringing fair young Basil's funeral knell. 
 Still the maiden clung most firmly, and with trembling lips and 
 
 white, 
 Said to hush her heart's wild beating, — 
 
 " Curfew shall not ring to-night." 
 
 It was o'er, the bell had ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped 
 
 once more 
 Firmly on the dark old ladder, where for hundred years before,

 Human foot had not been planted. The brave deed that she had 
 
 done 
 Should be told long ages after, as the rays of setting sun 
 Should illume the sky with beauty ; aged sires with heads of white, 
 Long should tell the little children, 
 
 Curfew did not ring that night. 
 
 O'er the distant hills came Cromwell ; Bessie sees him, and her br,ow. 
 Full of hope and full of gladness, has no anxious traces now. * 
 
 At his feet she tells her story, shows her hands all bruised and torn ; 
 And her face so sweet and pleading, yet with sorrow pale and worn, 
 Touched his heart w r ith sudden pity, lit his eye with misty light : 
 " Go, your lover lives," said Cromwell, 
 
 " Curfew shall not ring to-night ! " 
 
 GONE WITH A HANDSOMER MAN. 
 
 John. 
 
 I've worked in the field all day, a-plowin' the "stony streak;" 
 I've scolded my team till I'm hoarse ; I've tramped till my legs are 
 
 weak ; 
 I've choked a dozen swears (so as not to tell Jane fibs) 
 When the plow-p'int struck a stone and the handles punched my 
 
 ribs. 
 
 I've put my team in the barn, and rubbed their sweaty coats ; 
 I've fed 'em a heap of hay and a half a bushel of oats; 
 And to see the way they eat makes me like eatin' feel, 
 And Jane won't say to-night that I don't make out a meal. 
 
 Well said ! the door is locked ! but here she's left the key, 
 Under the step, in a place known only to her and me ; 
 I wonder who's dyin' or dead, that she's hustled off pell-mell: 
 But here on the table's a note, and probably this will tell. 
 
 Good God ! my wife is gone ! my wife is gone astray ! 
 
 The letter it says, "Good-bye, for I'm a-going away; 
 
 I've lived with you six months, John, and so far I've been true; 
 
 But I'm going away to-day w T ith a handsomer man than you."

 A han'sorner man than me ! Why, that ain't much to say; 
 There's han'sorner men than me go past here every day. 
 There's han'sorner men than me — I ain't of the han'som kind ; 
 But a lovin'er man than I was I guess she'll never find. 
 
 Curse her ! curse her ! I say, and give my curses wings ! 
 May the words of love I've spoke be changed to scorpion stings! 
 Oh, she filled my heart with joy, she emptied my heart of doubt, 
 And now, with a scratch of a pen, she lets my heart's blood out ! 
 
 Curse her ! curse her ! say I ; she'll some time rue this day ; 
 She'll sometime learn that hate is a game that two can play ; 
 And long before she dies she'll grieve she ever was born ; 
 And I'll plow her grave with hate, and seed it down to scorn ! 
 
 As sure as the world goes on, there'll come a time when she 
 Will read the devilish heart of that han'sorner man than me ; 
 And there'll be a time when he will find, as others do, 
 That she who is false to one can be the same with two. 
 
 And when her face grows pale, and when her eyes grow dim, 
 And when he is tired of her and she is tired of him, 
 She'll do what she ought to have done, and coolly count the cost; 
 And then she'll see things clear, and know what she has lost. 
 
 And thoughts that are now asleep will wake up. in her mind, 
 And she will mourn and cry for what she has left behind ; 
 And may be she'll sometimes long for me — for me — but no! 
 I've blotted her out of my heart, and I will not have it so. 
 
 And yet in her girlish heart there was some thin' or other she had 
 
 That fastened a man to her, and wasn't entirely bad ; 
 
 And she loved me a little, I think, although it didn't last ; 
 
 But I musn't think of these things — I've buried 'em in the past. 
 
 I'll take my hard words back,. nor make a bad matter worse; 
 She'll have trouble enough ; she shall not have my curse ; 
 But I'll live a life to square — and I will know that I can — 
 That she always will sorry be that she went with that han'somc 
 man. 
 
 Ah, here is her kitchen-dress! it makes my poor eyes blur; 
 It seems, when I look at that, as if 'twas holdin' her.

 And here are her week-day shoes, and there is her week-day hat, 
 And yonder's her weddin' gown : I wonder she didn't take that. 
 
 'Twas only this mornin' she came and called me her "dearest dear," 
 And said I was makin' for her a regular paradise here ; 
 
 God ! if you want a man to sense the pains of hell, 
 Before you pitch him in just keep him in heaven a spell T 
 
 Good-bye ! I wish that death had severed us two apart. 
 You've lost a worshiper here — you've crushed a lovin' heart. 
 I'll worship no woman again ; but I guess I'll learn to pray, 
 And kneel as you used to kneel before you run away. 
 
 And if I thought I could bring my words on heaven to bear, 
 And if I thought I had some little influence there, 
 
 1 would pray that I might be, if it only could be so, 
 As happy and as gay as I was half an hour ago. 
 
 Jane (entering.) 
 
 Why, John, what a litter here ! you've thrown things all around ! 
 Come, what's the matter now ? and what've you lost or found ? 
 And here's my father here, a-waiting for supper, too ; 
 I've been a-riding with him — he's that "handsomer man than you/' 
 
 Ha ! ha ! Pa, take a seat, while I put the kettle on, 
 
 And get things ready for tea, and kiss my dear old John. 
 
 Why, John, you look so strange! Come, what has crossed your 
 
 track? 
 I was only a-joking, you know ; I'm willing to take it back. 
 
 John (aside.) 
 
 Well, now, if this ain't a joke, with rather a bitter cream ! 
 It seems as if I'd woke from a mighty ticklish dream ; 
 And I think she "smells a rat," for she smiles at me so queer; 
 I hope she don't ; good Lord ! I hope that they didn't hear ! 
 
 'Twas one of her practical drives — she thought I'd understand ! 
 But 111 never break sod again till I get the lay of the land. 
 But one thing's settled with me — to appreciate heaven well, 
 'Tis good for a man to have some fifteen minutes of hell.

 ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
 
 'Twas the eve before Christmas; "Good-night" had been said, 
 
 And Annie and Willie had crept into bed; 
 
 There were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes, 
 
 And each little bosom was heaving with sighs, 
 
 For to-night their stern father's command had been given 
 
 That they should retire precisely at seven 
 
 Instead of at eight ; for they troubled him more 
 
 With questions unheard of than ever before : 
 
 He had told them he thought this delusion a sin — 
 
 No such being as " Santa Claus" ever had been — 
 
 And he hoped after this he should never more hear 
 
 How he scrambled down chimneys with presents each year. 
 
 And this was the reason that two little heads 
 
 So restlessly tossed on their soft, downy beds. 
 
 Eight, nine, and the clock. on the steeple tolled ten ; 
 
 Not a word had been spoken by either till then, 
 
 When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep, 
 
 And whispered, " Dear Annie, is you fast asleep?" 
 
 "Why no, brother Willie," a sweet voice replies, 
 
 "I've tried in vain, but I can't shut my eyes, 
 For somehow it makes me sorry because 
 Dear papa has said there is no 'Santa Claus.' 
 Now we know there is, and it can't be denied, 
 For he came every year before mamma died : 
 But then, I've been thinking that she used to pray, 
 And God would hear every thing mamma would say ; 
 And perhaps she asked Him to send Santa Claus here, 
 With the sack full of presents he brought every year." 
 
 "Well, why tan't we pay dest as mamma did then, 
 And ask Dod to send him with presents aden?" 
 
 "I've been thinking so too," and, without a word more, 
 Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor, 
 And four little knees the soft carpet pressed, 
 And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast. 
 
 "Now, Willie, you know, we must firnily believe 
 That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive ; 
 You must wait just as still till I say the 'Amen,' 
 And by that you will know that vour turn has come then,

 * Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me, 
 And grant us the favor we are asking of thee. 
 I want a wax dolly, a tea-set and ring, 
 And an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring. 
 Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see 
 That Santa Claus loves us far better than he ; 
 Don't let him get fretful and angry again 
 At dear brother Willie and Annie. Amen.' " 
 
 " Please, Desus, et Santa Taus turn down to-night, 
 And bring us some pesents before it is ight ; 
 I want he should div me a nice ittle sed, 
 With bright shinin unners and all painted ed ; 
 A box full of tandy, a book and a toy — 
 Amen — and den, Desus, I'll be a dood boy." 
 Their prayers being ended, they raised up their heads, 
 And, with hearts light and cheerful, again sought their beds ; 
 They were soon lost in slumber, both peaceful and deep, 
 And with fairies in Dreamland were roaming in sleep. 
 Eight, nine, and the little French clock had struck ten, 
 Ere the father had thought of his children again ; 
 He seems now to hear Annie's half-suppressed sighs, 
 And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes ; 
 
 "I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said, 
 
 " And should not have sent them so early to bed; 
 But then I was troubled, my feelings found vent, 
 For bank stock to-day has come down ten per cent. 
 But of course they've forgotten their troubles ere this, 
 And that I denied them the thrice asked for kiss ; 
 But, just to make sure, I'll steal up to their door, 
 For I never spoke harsh to my darlings before." 
 So saying, he softly ascended the stairs, 
 And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers; 
 His Annie's " bless papa" draws forth the big tears, 
 And Willie's grave promise falls sweet on his ears. 
 
 "Strange, strange, I'd forgotten," said he, with a sigh, 
 
 "How I longed when a child to have Christmas draw nigh. 
 I'll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said, 
 
 " By answering their prayers ere I sleep in my bed." 
 Then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down. 
 Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown,

 Donned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street, 
 
 A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet, 
 
 Nor stopped he until he had bought every thing, 
 
 From the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring; 
 
 Indeed he kept adding so much to his store 
 
 That the various presents outnumbered a score ; 
 
 Then homeward he turned with his holiday load, 
 
 And, with Aunt Mary's help, in the nursery 'twas stowed. 
 
 Miss Dolly was seated beneath a pine tree, 
 
 By the side of a table spread out for her tea ; 
 
 A work-box well filled in the centre was laid, 
 
 And on it the ring for which Annie had prayed. 
 
 A soldier in uniform stood by a sled, 
 
 "With bright shining runners and painted all red." 
 There were balls, dogs, and horses, books pleasing to see, 
 And birds of all colors were perched in the tree, 
 While Santa Claus, laughing stood up in the top, 
 As if getting ready more presents to drop ; 
 And. as the fond father the picture surveyed, 
 He thought for his trouble he had amply been paid, 
 And he said to himself, as be brushed off a tear, 
 
 "I'm happier to-night than I've been for a year; 
 I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before — 
 What care I if bank stock falls ten per cent, more. 
 Hereafter 111 make it a rule, I believe, 
 To have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas eve." 
 So thinking, he gently extinguished the light, 
 And tripped down the stairs to retire for the night. 
 As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun 
 Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one, 
 Four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide, 
 And at the same moment the presents 'espied. 
 Then out of then- beds they sprang with a bound, 
 And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found ; 
 They laughed and they cried in their innocent glee, 
 And shouted for " papa" to come quick and see 
 What presents old Santa Claus brought in the night 
 ( Just the things that they wanted,) and left before light; 
 
 "And now," added Annie in a voice soft and low, 
 
 "You'll believe there's a ' Santa Claus,' papa, I know."

 While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee, 
 Determined no secret between them should be, 
 And told in soft whispers how Annie had said 
 That their dear blessed mamma, so long ago dead, 
 Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair, 
 And that God, up in heaven had answered her prayer. 
 
 "Then we dot up and prayed dest as well as we tould, 
 And Dod answered our prayers — now wasn't he dood?" 
 
 "I should say that he was, if he sent you all these, 
 And know just what presents my children would please. 
 ( Well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf, 
 'Twould be cruel to tell him I did it myself. ) 
 Blind father ! who caused your stern heart to relent, 
 And the hasty words spoke so soon to repent? 
 'Twas the Being who made you steal softly up stairs, 
 And made you His agent to answer their prayers.

 THE EDITOR'S GUESTS. 
 
 The Editor sat in his sanctum, his countenance furrowed with care, 
 His mind at the bottom of business, his feet at the top of a chair, 
 His chair-arm an elbow supporting, his right hand upholding his 
 
 head, 
 His eyes on his dusty old table, with different documents spread : 
 There were thirty long pages from Howler, with underlined capitals 
 
 topped, 
 And a short disquisition from Growler, requesting his newspaper 
 
 stopped ; 
 There were lyrics from Gusher, the poet, concerning sweet flow 'rets 
 
 and zephyrs,, 
 And a stray gem from Plodder, the farmer describing a couple of 
 
 heifers ; 
 There were billets from beautiful maidens, and bills from a grocer 
 
 or two, 
 And his best leader hitched to a letter, which inquired if he wrote 
 
 it, or who ? 
 There were raptures of praises from writers of the weekly mellifluous 
 
 school,

 And one of his rival's last papers, informing him he was a fool ; 
 
 There wen 1 several long resolutions, with names telling whom they 
 
 were by, 
 Canonizing some harmless old brother who had done nothing worse 
 
 than to die; 
 There were traps on that table to catch him, and serpents to sting 
 
 and to smite him ; 
 There were gift enterprises to sell him, and bitters attempting to bite 
 
 him ; 
 There were long staring " ads" from the city, and money with never 
 
 a one, 
 Which added, "Please give this insertion, and send in your bill 
 
 when you're done; " 
 There were letters from organizations — their meetings, their wants, 
 
 and their laws — 
 Which said, " Can you print this announcement for the good of our 
 
 glorious cause?" 
 There were tickets inviting his presence to festivals, parties, and 
 
 shows, 
 Wrapped in notes with "Please give us a notice" demurely slipped 
 
 in at the close ; 
 In short, as his eye took the table, and ran o'er its ink-spattered 
 
 trash, 
 There was nothing it did not encounter, excepting perhaps it was 
 
 cash. 
 The Editor dreamily pondered on several ponderous things ; 
 On different lines of action, and the pulling of different strings ; 
 Upon some equivocal doings, and some unequivocal duns ; 
 On how few oc his numerous patrons were quietly prompt-paying 
 
 ones ; 
 On friends who subscribed "just to help him," and wordy encour- 
 agement lent, 
 And had given him plenty of counsel, but never had paid him a cent ; 
 On vinegar, kind-hearted people were feeding him every hour, 
 Who saw not the work they were doing but wondered that " printers 
 
 are sour! " 
 On several intelligent townsmen, whose kindness was so without 
 
 stint 
 That they kept an eye out on his business, and told him just what 
 
 he should print ;

 On men who had rendered him favors, and never pushed forward 
 
 their claims, 
 So long as the paper was crowded with "locals" containing their 
 
 names ; 
 On various other small matters, sufficient his temper to roil, 
 And finely contrived to he making the hlood of an editor hoil ; 
 And so one may see that his feelings could hardly he said to he 
 
 smooth, 
 And he needed some pleasant occurrence his ruffled emotions to 
 
 soothe : 
 He had it; for lo! on the threshold, a slow and reliable tread, 
 And a farmer invaded the sanctum, and these are the words that he 
 
 said: 
 
 "Good-mornin', sir, Mr. Printer; how is your body to-day? 
 I'm glad you're to home ; for )^ou fellers is al'ays a runnin' away. 
 Your paper last week wa'n't so spicy nor sharp as the one week 
 
 before : 
 But I s'pose when the campaign is opened, you'll be whoopin' it 
 
 up to 'em more. 
 That feller that's printin' The Smasher is goin' for you perty smart ; 
 And -our folks said this mornin, at breakfast, they thought he was 
 
 gettin' the start. 
 But I hushed 'em right up in a minute, and said a good word for 
 
 you; 
 I told 'em I b'lieved you was try in' to do just as well as you knew ; 
 And I told 'em that someone was sayin', and whoever 'twas it is so, 
 That you can't expect much of no one man, nor blame him for what 
 
 he don't know. 
 But, layin' aside pleasure for business, I've brought you my little boy 
 
 Jim; 
 And I thought I would see if you couldn't make an editor outen of 
 
 him. 
 
 "My family stock is increasin', while other folks' seems to run short. 
 I've got a right smart of a family — it's one of the old-fashioned sort : 
 There's Ichabod, Isaac, and Israel, a-workin' away on the farm — 
 They do 'bout as much as one good boy, and make things go off like

 But they're tol'able steady in one thing — they al'ways git round to 
 
 their meals. 
 There's Peter is busy inventin' (though what he invents I can't see,) 
 And Joseph is studyin' medicine — and both of 'em boardin' with 
 
 me. 
 There's Abram and Albert is married, each workin' my farm for 
 
 himself, 
 And Sam smashed his nose at a shootin', and so he is laid on the 
 
 shelf. 
 The rest of the boys are all growin', 'cept this little runt which is 
 
 Jim, 
 And I thought that perhaps I'd be makin' an editor outen o' him." 
 
 " He ain't no great shakes for to labor, though I've labored with him 
 
 a good deal, 
 And give him some strappin' good arguments I know he coulden't 
 
 help but to feel ; 
 But he's built out of second growth timber, and nothin' about him 
 
 is big 
 Exceptin' his appetite only, and there he's as good as a pig. 
 I keep him a-carryin' luncheons, and fillin' and bringin' the jugs, 
 And take him among the pertatoes, and set him to pickin' the bugs ; 
 And then there is things to be doin' a-helpin the women indoors ; 
 There's churnin' and washin' of dishes, and other descriptions of 
 
 chores ; 
 But he don't take to nothin' but victuals, and he'll never be much, 
 
 I'm afraid, 
 So I thought it would be a good notion to larn him the editor's trade. 
 His body's too small for a farmer, his judgment is rather too slim, 
 But I thought we perhaps could be makin' an editor outen o' him ! 
 
 " It ain't much to get up a paper — it woulden't take him long for to 
 learn ! 
 
 He could feed the machine, I'm thinkin' ; with a good strappin' fel- 
 low to turn. 
 
 And things that was once hard in doin', is easy enough now to do ; 
 
 Just keep your eye on your machinery, and crack your arrange- 
 ments right through. 
 
 I used for to wonder at readin', and where it was got up and how ; 
 
 But 'tis most of it made by machinery, I can see it all plain enough 
 now.

 And poetry, too, is constructed by machines of different designs, 
 Each one with a guage and a chopper to see to the length of the 
 
 lines ; 
 And I hear a New York clairvoyant is runnin' one sleeker than 
 
 grease, 
 And a-rentin' her heaven-born productions at a couple of dollars 
 
 apiece ; 
 An' since the whole trade has growed easy, 'twould be easy enough,* 
 
 I've a whim, 
 If you was agreed, to be makin' an editor outen of Jim! " 
 
 The Editor sat in his sanctum and looked the old man in the eye, 
 Then glanced at the grinning young hopeful, and mournfully made 
 
 his reply: 
 "Is your son a small unbound edition of Moses and Solomon both? 
 Can he compass his spirit with meekness, and strangle a natural 
 
 oath ? 
 Can he leave all his wrongs to the future, and carry his heart in his 
 
 cheek? 
 Can he do an hour's work in a minute, and live on a sixpence a 
 
 week ? 
 Can he courteously talk to an equal, and brow beat an impudent 
 
 dunce ? 
 Can he keep things in apple-pie order, and do half a dozen at 
 
 once? 
 Can he press all the springs of knowledge, with quick and reliable 
 
 touch, 
 And be sure that he knows how much to know, and knows how to 
 
 not know too much ? 
 Does he know how to spur up his virtue, and put a check-rein on 
 
 his pride ? 
 Can he carry a gentleman's manner within a rhinoceros' hide? 
 Can he know all, and do all, and be all, with cheerfulness, courage 
 
 and vim? 
 If so, we perhaps can be makin' an editor 'outen of him.' " 
 
 The fanner stood curiously listening, while wonder his visage o'er- 
 
 spread ; 
 And he said, " Jim, I guess we'll be goin' ; he's probably out of his 
 
 head."

 But lo! on the rickety stair-case, another reliable tread, 
 
 And entered another old farmer, and these are the words that he 
 
 said : 
 "Good-morning, sir, Mr. Editor, how is the folks to-day? 
 I owe you for next year's paper; I thought I'd come in and pay. 
 And Jones is a goin' to take it, and this is his money here; 
 I shut down on lendin' it to him, and coaxed him to try it a year. 
 And here is a few little items that happened last week in our town. 
 I thought theyd' look good for the paper, and so I just jotted 'em 
 
 down. 
 And here is a basket of cherries my wife picked expressly for you ; 
 And a small bunch of flowers from Jennie — she thought she must 
 
 send somethin' too. 
 You're doin' the politics bully, as all of our family agree ; 
 Just keep your old goose-quill a floppin', and give 'em a good one 
 
 for me. 
 And now you are chuck full of business, and I won't be takin' your 
 
 time ; 
 I've things of my own I must 'tend to — good-day, sir, I b'lieve I 
 
 will climb." 
 
 The Editor sat in his sanctum and brought down his fist with a thump: 
 " God bless that old farmer," he muttered, "he's a regular Editor's 
 trump." 
 
 And 'tis thus with our noble profession, and thus it will ever 
 be, still; 
 
 There are some who appreciate its labors, and some who perhaps 
 never will. 
 
 But in the great time that is coming, when loudly the trumpet 
 shall sound, 
 
 And they who have labored and rested shall come from the quiver- 
 ing ground ; 
 
 When they who have striven and suffered to teach and ennoble 
 the race, 
 
 Shall march at the front of the column, each one in his God-given 
 place, 
 
 As they pass through the gates of The City with proud and victo- 
 rious tread, 
 
 The editor, printer, and " devil," will travel not far from the head.

 NOTHING TO WEAR. 
 
 Miss Flora McFlimsey, of Madison Square, 
 Has made three separate journeys to Paris, 
 And her father assures me, each time she was there, 
 
 That she and her friend Mrs. Harris, 
 Spent six consecutive weeks without stopping, 
 In one continuous round of shopping ; 
 Shopping alone, and shopping together, 
 At all hours of the day, and in all sorts of weather ; 
 For all manner of things that a woman can put 
 On the crown of her head or the sole of her foot, 
 Or wrap round her shoulders, or fit round her waist, 
 Or that can be sewed on, or pinned on, or laced, 
 Or tied on with a string, or stitched on with a bow, 
 In front or behind, above or below: 
 For bonnets, mantillas, capes, collars, and shawls ; 
 Dresses for breakfasts, and dinners, and balls; 
 Dresses to sit in, and stand in, and walk in ; 
 Dresses to dance in, and flirt in, and talk in; 
 Dresses in which to do — nothing at all ; 
 Dresses for winter, spring, summer, and fall ; 
 All of them different in color and pattern, 
 Silk, muslin, and lace, crape, velvet, .and satin, 
 Brocade, and broadcloth, and other material, 
 Quite as expensive and much more ethereal. 
 
 And though scarce three months have passed since the day, 
 This merchandise went, on several carts, up Broadway, 
 This same Miss McFlimsey, of Madison Square, 
 The last time we met, was in utter despair, 
 Because she had nothing whatever to wear ! 
 Nothing to wear ! Now, as this is a true ditty, 
 I do not assert — this, you know, is between us — 
 That she's in a state of absolute nudity,

 Like Powers' Greek Slave, or the Medici Venus ; 
 But I do mean to say, I have heard her declare, 
 When, at the same moment, she had on a dress 
 Which cost five hundred dollars, and not a cent less, 
 And jewelry worth ten times more, I should guess, 
 That she had not a thing in the wide world to wear! 
 
 I should mention just here, that out of Miss Flora's 
 Two hundred and fifty or sixty adorers, 
 I had just been selected as he who should throw all 
 The rest in the shade, by the gracious bestowal 
 On my self, after twenty or thirty rejections, 
 Of those fossil remains which she called her " affections," 
 And that rather decayed, but well-known w r ork of art, 
 Which Miss Flora persisted in styling " her heart." 
 So we were engaged. Our troth had been plighted, 
 Not by moon-beam or star-beam, by fountain or grove, 
 But in a front parlor, most brilliantly lighted, 
 Beneath the gas-fixtures we whispered our love, 
 Without any romance, or raptures, or sighs, 
 And without any tears in Miss Flora's blue eyes. 
 Or blushes, or transports, or such silly actions. 
 It was one of the quietest business transactions, 
 With a very small sprinkling of sentiment, if any, 
 And a very large diamond imported by Tiffany. 
 While on her virginal lips I imprinted a kiss, 
 She exclaimed, as a sort of parenthesis, 
 And by way of putting me quite at my ease, 
 " You know, I'm to polka as much as I please, 
 And flirt when I like — now stop, don't you speak — 
 And you're not to come here more than twice in a week 
 Or talk to me either at party or ball, 
 But always be ready to come when I call ; 
 For this is a sort of engagement, you see, 
 Which is binding on you but not binding on me.

 Well, having thus wooed Miss McFlimsey and gained her, 
 
 With the silks, crinolines, and hoops that contained her, 
 
 I had, as I thought, contingent remainder 
 
 At least in the property, and the best right 
 
 To appear as its escort by day and by night ; 
 
 And it being the week of the Stuckup's grand ball — 
 
 Their cards had been out a fortnight or so, 
 
 And had set all the Avenue on the tip-toe — 
 
 I considered it only duty to call, 
 
 And see if Miss Flora intended to go. 
 
 I found her — as ladies are apt to be found, 
 
 When the time intervening between the first sound 
 
 Of the bell and the visitor's entry is shorter 
 
 Than usual — I found ; I won't say — I caught her — 
 
 Intent on the pier-glass, undoubtedly meaning 
 
 To see if perhaps in didn't need cleaning. 
 
 . She turned as I entered — " Why, Harry, you sinner, 
 I thought that you went to the Flashers to dinner ! " 
 
 " So I did," I replied, "but the dinner is swallowed, 
 And digested, I trust, 'tis now nine and more, 
 So being relieved from that duty, I followed 
 Inclination, which led me, you see, to your door. 
 And now Avill your ladyship so condescend 
 As just to inform me if you intend 
 Your beauty, and graces, and presence to lend, 
 (All which, when I own, I hope no one will borrow) 
 To the Stuckups whose party, you know, is to-morrow?" 
 
 The fair Flora looked up with a pitiful air, 
 And answered quite promptly, " Why Harry, mon cher, 
 I should like above all things to go with you there; 
 But really and truly — I've nothing to wear." 
 
 " Nothing to wear! go just as you are ; 
 Wear the dress you have on, and you'll be by far,

 I engage, the most bright and particular star 
 On the. Btuckup horizon" — I stopped, for her eye, 
 Notwithstanding this delicate onset of flattery 
 Opened on me at once a most terrible battery 
 Of scorn and amazement. She made no reply, 
 But gave a slight turn to the end of her nose 
 (That pure Grecian feature), as much as to say, 
 " How absurd that any sane man should suppose 
 That a lady would go to a ball in the clothes, 
 No matter how fine, that she wears every day ! " 
 
 So I ventured again — " Wear your crimson brocade," 
 
 (Second turn up of nose) — " That's too dark by a shade." 
 " Your blue silk"— " That's too heavy ; * . " Your pink*— "That's 
 
 too light." 
 " Wear tulle over satin" — "I can't endure white." 
 " Your rose-colored, then, the best of the batch" — 
 " I haven't a thread of point lace to match." 
 " Your brown moire antique" — " Yes, and look like a Quaker; " 
 "The pearl-colored " — "I would, but that plaguey dress-maker 
 
 Has had it a week" — "Then that exquisite lilac, 
 
 In which you would melt the heart of a Shylock." 
 
 (Here the nose took again the same elevation). 
 "I wouldn't wear that for the whole of creation." 
 " Why not? It's my fancy, there's nothing could strike it 
 
 As more comme il faut — " " Yes, but dear me, that lean 
 
 Sophronia Stuckup has got one just like it, 
 
 And I won't appear dressed like a Miss of sixteen." 
 "Then that splendid purple, that sweet Mazariue; 
 
 That zephyr-like tarleton, that rich grenadine." 
 " Not one of all which is fit to be seen," 
 
 Said the lady, becoming excited and flushed. 
 "Then wear," I exclaimed, in a tone which quite crushed 
 
 Opposition, " that gorgeous toilette which you sported 
 
 In Paris last spring, at the grand presentation,

 When you quite turned the head of the head of the nation ; 
 And by all the grand court were so very much courted." 
 The end of the nose was portentiously tipped up, 
 And both the bright eyes shot forth indignation, 
 As she burst upon me with the fierce exclamation, 
 
 " I have worn that three times at the least calculation, 
 And that and the most of my 'dresses are ripped up ! " 
 Here / ripped ovt something perhaps rather rash, 
 Quite innocent, though ; but, to use an expression 
 More striking than classic, it " settled my hash." 
 And proved very soon the last act of our session. 
 
 " Fiddlesticks, is it, sir? I wonder the ceiling 
 Doesn't fall down and crush you — oh, you men have no feeling, 
 You selfish, unnatural, illiberal creatures, 
 Who set yourselves up as patterns and preachers. 
 Your silly pretense — why, what a mere guess it is ! 
 Pray, what do you know of a woman's necessities ? 
 I have told you and shown you I've nothing to wear, 
 And it's perfectly plain you not only don't care, 
 But you do not believe me," (here the nose went still higher). 
 
 " I suppose if you dared, you would call me a liar. 
 Our engagement is ended, Sir — yes, on the spot ; 
 You're a brute, and a monster, and — I don't know what." 
 I mildly suggested the words — " Hottentot, 
 Pickpocket, and cannibal, Tartar, and thief," 
 As gentle expletives which might give relief; 
 But this only proved a spark to the powder, 
 And the storm I had raised came faster and louder, 
 It blew and it rained, thundered, lightened, and hailed 
 Interjections, verbs, pronouns, till language quite failed 
 To express the abusive, and then its arrears 
 Were brought up all at once by a torrent of tears. 
 
 Well, I felt for the lady, and felt for my hat, too, 
 Improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo,

 In lieu of expressing the feelings which lay 
 
 Quite too deep for words, as Wordsworth would say ; 
 
 Then, without going through the form of a bow, 
 
 Found myself in the entry — I hardly knew how — 
 
 On door-step and sidewalk, past lamp-post and square, 
 
 At home and up stairs, in my own easy chair ; 
 
 Poked my feet into slippers, my fire into blaze, 
 
 And said to myself as I lit my cigar, 
 
 Supposing a man had the wealth of the Czar 
 
 Of the Russians to boot, for the rest of his days, 
 
 On the whole, do you think he would have much to spare 
 
 If he married a woman with nothing to wear? 
 
 Since that night, taking pains that it should not be bruited 
 
 Abroad in society, I have instituted 
 
 A course of inquiry, extensive and thorough, 
 
 On this vital subject, and find, to my horror, 
 
 That the fair Flora's case is by no means surprising, 
 
 But that there exists the greatest distress 
 
 In our female community, solely arising 
 
 From this unsupplied destitution of dress, 
 
 Whose unfortunate victims are filling the air 
 
 With the pitiful wail of " Nothing to wear." 
 
 AVon't Stewart, or some of our dry-goods importers, 
 Take a contract for clothing our wives and our daughters? 
 Or, to furnish the cash to supply these distresses, 
 And life's pathway strew with shawls, collars, and dresses, 
 Ere the want of them makes it much rougher and thornier, 
 Won't some one discover a new California? 
 
 Oh ladies, dear ladies, the next sunny day 
 Please trundle your hoops just out of Broadway, 
 From its whirl and its bustle, its fashion and pride, 
 And the temples of Trade which tower on each side,

 To the alleys and lanes, where Misfortune and Guilt 
 
 Their children have gathered, their city have built ; 
 
 Where Hunger and Vice, like twin beasts of prey, 
 
 Have hunted their victims to gloom and despair ; 
 
 Raise the rich, dainty dress, and the fine broidered skirt, 
 
 Pick your delicate way through the dampness and dirt, 
 
 Grope through the dark dens, climb the rickety stair 
 
 To the garret, where wretches, the young and the old, 
 
 Half-starved and half-naked, lie crouched from the cold. 
 
 See those skeleton limbs, those frost-bitten feet, 
 
 All bleeding and bruised by the stones of the street ; 
 
 Hear the sharp cry of childhood, the deep groans that swell 
 
 From the poor dying creature who writhes on the floor, 
 
 Hear the curses that sound like the echoes of Hell, 
 
 As you sicken and shudder and fly from the door ; 
 
 Then home to your wardrobes, and say, if you dare — 
 
 Spoiled children of Fashion, — youVe nothing to wear! 
 
 And oh, if perchance there should be a sphere, 
 Where all is made right which so puzzles us here, 
 Where the glare, and the glitter, and the tinsel of Time 
 Fade and die in the light of that region sublime, 
 Where the soul, disenchanted of flesh and of sense, 
 Unscreened by its trappings, and shows, and pretense, 
 Must be clothed for the life and the service above, 
 With purity, truth, faith, meekness, and love ; 
 Oh, daughters of Earth ! foolish virgins, beware ! 
 Lest in that upper realm you have nothing to wear !

 ABEL LAW AND THE GHOST. 
 
 It has been about eighty-five years since Abel Law, a 
 round-favored, merry old soldier of the Revolutionary War, 
 was married. And he married a most abominable shrew. 
 Did you ever read of the temper of Shakspeare's Catharine ? 
 It could no more be compared to her's than the temper of 
 my wife to that of Lucifer's. She had a harsh, irregular 
 face, spread over with spots of white and red, like a cran- 
 berry marsh. She had eyes like a weasel's, and hair the 
 color of a wisp of straw; and a disposition like a cross-cut 
 saw. The appellation of this lovely dame was Nancy; now 
 don't forget her name. 
 
 Her brother David was a tall, good looking fellow, but 
 that was all; one of your great, big nothings, as we say 
 over here in Indiana, picking up old jokes and cracking 
 them on other folks. 
 
 Well, one night David resolved to have some fun, and 
 undertook to frighten his brother-in-law, Abel, who he 
 knew was on a journey, and would be returning that night 
 through a thick wood that stood down below T the house half a 
 mile or so. So with a long taper cap, made of white paper, 
 large enough to cover over a wig nearly as big as a corn 
 basket, and a sheet made to meet with both ends across his 
 breast — the way, you know, in which all ghosts are dressed 
 — he took his position near a huge oak tree, where he could 
 overlook the road, and see whatever might appear. 
 
 Now it happened, about an hour before, that Abel had 
 stopped at the table of an inn, to taste a flagon of malt 
 liquor, and some gin. This being done, he drove on, caring 
 no more for twenty ghosts, than if they w T ere so many posts. 
 
 At length, David grew tired of waiting; his patience was

 abating. Presently he hears the merry tones of his kins- 
 man's voice, and then the noise of wagon wheels among the 
 stones. Abel was quite elated; roaring with all his might, 
 and pouring forth scraps of old songs made in the Revolu- 
 tion. His head was full of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, and 
 Yorktown. And thus jovially lie drove on, scaring the 
 whip-poor-wills among the trees, with rhymes somewhat * 
 like these : [Sings] 
 
 " See the Yankees leave the hill 
 
 With baggernetts declining, 
 With lop-down hats and rusty guns, 
 
 And leather aprons shining. 
 See the Yankees — 
 
 Whoa!! Why, what's that?" said Abel, staring like a 
 cat, as fearfully that figure strode into the middle of the 
 road. " My conscience ! what a suit of clothes ! Some 
 crazy fellow, I suppose. Hallo! friend, what's your name? 
 By the powers of gin, that's a strange dress you travel in." 
 
 "Be silent, Abel; for I have come to read your doom. 
 Be quiet then while I your fate declare. I am a spirit" — 
 
 " Oh ! ! Ah ! ! ! I suppose you are ! But you w T on't hurt 
 me, and I'll tell you why. Here's a fact that you can't 
 deny : Spirits are either bad or good — now that's under- 
 stood. And if you're a good spirit you won't hurt me, and 
 if you're an evil — and Oh ! ! I dun no, you may be the 
 Devil!! and if that's the case, you'll recollect, I fancy, that 
 I'm married to your sister Nancy ! "

 DARirS GREEN AND HIS FLYING MACHINE. 
 
 If ever there lived a Yankee lad, 
 Wise or otherwise, good or bad, 
 Who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump 
 With flapping arms from stake or stump, 
 
 Or spreading the tail 
 
 Of his coat for a sail, 
 Take a soaring leap from post or rail, 
 
 And wonder why 
 
 He couldn't fly, 
 And flap and flutter and wish and try, — 
 If ever you knew a country dunce 
 Who didn't try that as often as once, 
 All I can say is, that's a sign 
 He never would do for a hero of mine. 
 
 An aspiring genius was D. Green : 
 
 The son of a farmer, — age fourteen; 
 
 His body was long and lank and lean, — 
 
 Just right for flying, as will be seen ; 
 
 He had two eyes as bright as a bean, 
 
 And a freckled nose that grew between, 
 
 A little awry, — for I must mention 
 
 That he had riveted his attention 
 
 Upon his wonderful invention, 
 
 Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings, 
 
 And working his face as he worked the wings, 
 
 And with every turn of gimlet and screw 
 
 Turning and screwing his mouth round too, 
 
 Till his nose seemed bent 
 
 To catch the scent, 
 Around some corner, of new-baked pies,

 And his wrinkled cheeks and squinting eyes, 
 Grew puckered into a queer grimace, 
 That made him look very droll in the face, 
 And also very wise. 
 
 And wise he must been, to do more 
 Than ever a genius did before, 
 Excepting Daedalus of yore, 
 And his son Icarus, who wore 
 
 Upon their backs 
 
 Those wings of wax 
 He had read of in old almanacks. 
 Darius was clearly of the opinion, 
 That the air is also man's dominion, . 
 And that, with paddle, or fin, or pinion, 
 
 We soon or late 
 
 Shall navigate 
 The azure as now we sail the sea. 
 The thing looks simple enough to me; 
 
 And if you doubt it, 
 Hear how Darius reasoned about it. 
 
 " The birds can fly, 
 
 An' why can't I? 
 
 Must we give in," 
 
 Says he with a grin, 
 " That the bluebird an' phoebc 
 
 Are smarter 'n we be ? 
 Jest fold our hands an' see the s waller 
 An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler ? 
 Does the little chatterin', sassy wren, 
 No bigger 'n my thum', know more 'n men ?

 Jest show me that, 
 
 Or prove that the bat 
 Hez got more brains than's in my hat, 
 An ? I'll back down, an' not till then/ 1 
 
 He argued further: " Nor I can't see 
 What's th' use o' wings to a bumble-bee, 
 Fur to git a livin' w T ith, more 'n to me; — 
 
 Ain't my business 
 
 Importanter 'n his'n is ? 
 
 That Icarus 
 
 Made a perty muss, — 
 Him an' his daddy Daedalus. 
 They might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax 
 Would n't stand sun-heat an' hard whacks. 
 
 I'll make mine o' luther, 
 
 Ur sumthin' ur other." 
 
 And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned : 
 
 But I ain't goin' to show my hand 
 
 To mummies that never can understand 
 
 The fust idee that's big an' grand. 
 
 They'd a made fun o' creation, 
 
 Afore it was brought to a termination." 
 
 So he kept his secret from all the rest, 
 
 Safely buttoned within his vest ; 
 
 And in the loft above the shed 
 
 Himself he locks, with thimble and thread, 
 
 And wax and hammers and buckles and screws, 
 
 And all such things as geniuses use ; — 
 
 Two bats for patterns, curious fellows ! 
 
 A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows ; 
 
 Some wire, and several old umbrellas;

 A carriage-cover for tail and wings ; 
 
 A piece of harness; and straps and strings; 
 
 And a big strong box, 
 
 In which he locks 
 These and a hundred other things. 
 
 His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke 
 
 And Nathan and Jatham and Solomon, lurk 
 
 Around the corner to see him work,— 
 
 Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk, 
 
 Drawing the wax-end through with a jerk, 
 
 And boring the holes with a comical quirk 
 
 Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk. 
 
 But vainly they mounted each other's backs, 
 
 And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks ; 
 
 With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks 
 
 He plugged the knot-holes and caulked the cracks ; 
 
 And a dipper of water, which one would think 
 
 He had brought up into the loft to drink 
 
 When he chanced to be dry, 
 
 Stood always nigh, 
 
 For Darius was sly ; 
 And whenever at work he happened to spy 
 At chink or crevice a blinking eye, 
 He let the dipper of water fly. 
 " Take that ! an* ef ever ye git a peep, 
 Guess you'll ketch a weasel asleep ! " 
 
 And he sings as he locks 
 
 His big strong box : 
 (Song.) 
 " The weasel's head is small an' trim, 
 An' he is little an' long an' slim,

 An' quick of motion an' nimble of limb, 
 
 An' ef you'll be 
 
 Advised by me, 
 Keep wide awake when you 're ketchin' him." 
 
 So day after day 
 He stitched and tinkered and hammered away, 
 
 Till at last 't w T as done, — 
 The greatest invention under the sun ! 
 " An' now," says Darius, " hooray fur some fun ! " 
 
 'Twas the Fourth of July, 
 
 And the weather was dry, 
 And not a cloud was on all the sky, 
 Save a few light fleeces, which here and there, 
 
 Half mist, half air, 
 Like foam on the ocean w T ent floating by, — 
 Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen 
 For a nice little trip in a flying machine. 
 Thought cunning Darius : " Now I sha' n't go 
 Along 'ith the fellers to see the show. 
 I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough ! 
 An' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off*, 
 
 I'll have full swing 
 
 Fur to try the thing, 
 An' practice a little on the wing." 
 
 " Ain't goin' to see the celebration?" 
 Says brother Nate. " No ; botheration ; 
 I've got sich a cold — a toothache — I — 
 My gracious !- — feel's though I should fly ! " 
 
 Said Jatham"'Sho! 
 
 Guess ye better go." 
 
 But Darius said " No !

 Should n't wonder 'f you might see me, though, 
 'Long 'bout noon, ef I git red 
 O' this jumping thumpin' pain "n my head." 
 For all the while to himself he said : — 
 
 " I tell ye what ! 
 I'll fly a few times around the lot, 
 To see how't seems, then soon's I've got 
 The hang o' the thing, ez likely 's not, 
 
 I'll astonish the nation 
 
 An' all creation, 
 By flyin' over the celebration ! 
 Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle : 
 I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull ; 
 I'll dance on the chimbleys ; I'll stand on the steeple ; 
 I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people ! 
 I'll light on the liberty-pole, an' crow; 
 An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below, 
 ' What world's this 'ere 
 
 That I've come near?' 
 Fur I'll make 'em b'lieve I'm a chap f 'm the moon ; 
 An' I'll try a race 'ith their ol' balloon ! " 
 
 He crept from his bed ; 
 And seeing the others were gone, he said, 
 " I'm gittin' over the cold'n my head." 
 
 And away he sped, 
 To open the wonderful box in the shed. 
 
 His brothers had walked but a little way, 
 When Jatham to Nathan chanced to say, 
 
 " What is the feller up to, hey ? " 
 
 " Do' no', — the's suthin' ur other to pay, 
 Ur he would n't 'a' stayed to hum to-day."

 Says Burke, " His toothache's all 'n his eye ! 
 
 He never 'd miss a Fo'th-o'-July,

 Then Sol, the little one, spoke : " Consarn ! 
 
 Le's hurry back an' hide 'n the barn, 
 
 An' pay him fur tellin' us that yarn ! " 
 " Agreed ! " Through the orchard they creep back, 
 
 Along by the fences, behind the stack, 
 
 And one by one, through a hole in the wall, 
 
 In under the dusty barn they crawl, 
 
 Dressed in their Sunday garments all ; 
 
 And a very astonishing sight was that, 
 
 When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat 
 
 Came up through the floor like an ancient rat. 
 And there they hid ; 
 And Reuben slid 
 
 The fastenings back, and the door undid. 
 " Keep dark ! " said he, 
 " While I squint an' see what the' is to see." 
 
 As knights of old put on their mail, — 
 
 From head to foot 
 
 An iron suit, 
 Iron jacket and iron boot, 
 Iron breeches, and on the head 
 No hat, but an iron pot instead, 
 
 And under the chin the bail, 
 (I believe they called the thing a helm,) 
 Then sallied forth to overwhelm 
 The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm, 
 
 So this modern knight, 
 
 Prepared for flight, 
 Put on his wings and strapped them tight, —

 Jointed and jaunty, strong and light, — 
 Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip, — 
 Ten feet they measured from tip to tip ! 
 And a helm had he, but that he wore, 
 Not on his head, like those of yore, 
 
 But more like the helm of a ship. 
 
 " Hush ! " Reuben said, 
 " He's up in the shed ! 
 He's opened the winder,— I see his head ! 
 He stretches it out, . 
 An' pokes it about, 
 Look in' to see 'f the coast is clear, 
 
 An' nobody near ; — 
 Guess he do' no' who's hid in here ! 
 He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill ! 
 Stop laffin', Solomon ! Burke, keep still ! 
 He's a climbin' out now — Of all the things ! 
 What's he got on ? I van, it's wings ! 
 An' that t' other thing? I vum, it's a tail! 
 An' there he sets like a hawk on a rail ! 
 Steppin' careful, he travels the length 
 Of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength, 
 Now he stretches his wings like a monstrous bat ; 
 Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that, 
 Fur to see 'f the' 's any one passin' by ; 
 But the' 's on'y a calf an' a goslin' nigh. 
 They turn up at him a Avonderin' eye, 
 To see — the dragon ! He's goin' to fly ! 
 Away he goes ! Jimminy ! what a jump !

 To the ground with a thump!

 As a demon is hurled by an angePs spear, 
 
 Heels over head, to his proper sphere, — 
 
 Heels over head, and head over heels, 
 
 Dizzily down the abyss he wheels, — 
 
 So fell Darius. Upon his crown, 
 
 In the midst of the barn-yard, he came down, 
 
 In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings, 
 
 Broken braces and broken springs, 
 
 Broken tail and broken wings, 
 
 Shooting stars, and various things, — 
 
 Barn-yard litter of straw and chaff, 
 
 And much that wasn't so nice by half. 
 
 Away with a bellow fled the calf, 
 
 And what was that? Did the gosling laugh? 
 
 'Tis a merry roar 
 
 From the old barn door, 
 And he hears the voice of Jatham crying, 
 " Say, D'rius ! how do you like flyin' ? " 
 
 Slowly, ruefully, where he lay, 
 Darius just turned and looked that way, 
 As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cuff. 
 " Wal, I like fiyin' well enough," 
 He said; "but the' ain't sich a thunderin' sight 
 O* fun in it when ye come to light." 
 
 (Moral.) 
 
 I just have room for the moral here : 
 And this is the moral, — Stick to your sphere. 
 Or if you insist, as you have the right, 
 On spreading you wings for a loftier flight, 
 The moral is ; — Take care how you light.

 THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE. 
 
 " I thought, Mr. Allan, when I gave my Bennie to his 
 country, that not a father in all this broad land made so 
 precious a gift, — no, not one. The dear boy only slept a 
 minute, just one little minute, at his post; I know that was 
 all, for Bennie never dozed over a duty. How prompt and* 
 reliable he was! I know he only fell asleep one little sec- 
 ond ; — he was so young, and not strong, that boy of mine ! 
 Why, he was as tall as I, and only eighteen ! and now they 
 shoot him because he was found asleep when doing sentinel 
 duty! Twenty-four hours, the telegram said, — only twenty- 
 four hours. Where is Bennie now?" 
 
 "We will hope with his heavenly Father," said Mr. 
 Allan, soothingly. 
 
 " Yes, yes ; let us hope ; God is very merciful ! 
 
 "'I should be ashamed, father!' Bennie said, 'when' I 
 am a man, to think I never used this great right arm/ — 
 and he held it out so proudly before me, — ( for my country, 
 wh^n it needed it ! Palsy it rather than keep it at the plow ! ' 
 
 " ' Go, then, go, my boy," I said, e and God keep you ! ' 
 God has kept him, I think, Mr. Allan ! " and the farmer 
 repeated these last words slowly, as if, in spite of his rea- 
 son, his heart doubted them. 
 
 " Like the apple of his eye, Mr. Owen, doubt it not ! " 
 
 Blossom sat near them listening, with blanched cheek. 
 She had not shed a tear. Her anxiety had been so con- 
 cealed that no one had noticed it. She had occupied her- 
 self mechanically in the household cares. Now she answer- 
 ed a gentle tap at the kitchen door, opening it to receive from 
 a neighbor's hand a letter. "It is from him," was all she said. 
 
 It was like a message from the dead ! Mr. Owen took the

 letter, but could not break the envelope, on account of his 
 trembling fingers, and held it toward Mr. Allan, with the 
 helplessness of a child. 
 
 The minister opened it, and read as follows : — 
 
 " Dear Father : — When this reaches you, I shall be in eter- 
 nity. At first, it seemed awful to me ; but I have thought 
 about it so much now, that it has no terror. They say they 
 will not bind me, nor blind me ; but that I may meet my 
 death like a man. I thought, father, it might have been on 
 the battle-field, for my country, and that when I fell, it would 
 be fighting gloriously ; but to be shot down like a dog for 
 nearly betraying it, — to die for neglect of duty! O father, I 
 wonder the very thought does not kill me! But I shall not 
 disgrace you. I am going to write you all about it ; and 
 when I am gone, you may tell my comrades. I can not now. 
 
 " You know I promised Jemmie Carr's mother I would look 
 after her boy; and, when he fell sick, I did all I could for 
 him. He was not strong when he was ordered back into the 
 ranks, and the day before that night, I carried all his lug- 
 gage, besides my own, on our march. Toward night we went 
 in on double-quick, and though the luggage began to feel 
 very heavy, everybody else was tired too ; and as for Jem- 
 mie, if I had not lent him an arm now and then, he would 
 have dropped by the way. I was all tired out when we came 
 into camp, and then it was JemrmVs turn to be sentry, and 
 I would take his place ; but I was too tired, father. I could 
 not have kept awake if a gun had been pointed at my head; 
 but I did not know T it until — well, until it was too late." 
 
 "God be thanked !" interrupted Mr. Owen, reverently. " I 
 knew Bennie was not the boy to sleep carelessly at his post." 
 
 "They tell me to-day that I have a short reprieve, — 
 given to me by circumstances, — ' time to write to you/ our

 good Colonel says. Forgive him, father, he only does his 
 duty; he would gladly save me if he could; and do not lay 
 my death up against Jemmie. The poor boy is broken- 
 hearted, and does nothing but beg and entreat them to let 
 him die in my stead. 
 
 " I can't bear to think of mother and Blossom. Comfort 
 them, father ! Tell them I die as a brave boy should, and 
 that, when the war is over, they will not be ashamed of me, 
 as they must be now. God help me ; it is very hard to bear! 
 Good-by, father ! God seems near and dear to me ; not at 
 all as if He wished me to perish forever, but as if He felt 
 sorry for His poor, sinful, broken-hearted child, and would 
 take me to be with Him and my Saviour in a better — bet- 
 ter life." 
 
 A deep sigh burst from Mr. Owen's heart. "Amen," he 
 said solemnly, — "Amen." 
 
 " To-night, in the early twilight, I shall see the cows all 
 coming home from pasture, and precious little Blossom stand 
 on the back stoop, waiting for me, — but I shall never, never 
 come! God bless you all ! Forgive your poor Bennie." 
 
 Late that night the door of the " back stoop" opened soft- 
 ly, and a little figure glided out, and down the foot-path that 
 led to the road by the mill. She seemed rather flying than 
 walking, turning her head neither to the right nor the left, 
 looking only now and then to Heaven, and folding her hands, 
 as if in prayer. Two hours later, the same young girl stood at 
 the Mill Depot, watching the coming of the night train ; and 
 the conductor, as he reached down to lift her into the car, 
 wondered at the tear-stained face that was upturned toward 
 the dim lantern he held in his hand A few questions and 
 ready answers told him all ; and no father could have cared 
 more tenderly for his only child, than he for our little Blossom.

 She was on her way to Washington, to ask President 
 Lincoln for her brother's life. She had stolen away, leaving 
 only a note to tell her father where and why she had gone. 
 She had brought Bennie's letter with her: no good, kind 
 heart, like the President's, could refuse to be melted by it. 
 The next morning they reached New York, and the conductor 
 hurried her on to Washington. Every minute, now, might 
 be the means of saving her brother's life. And so, in an in- 
 credibly short time, Blossom reached the Capital, and hast- 
 ened immediately to the White House. The President had 
 but just seated himself to his morning's task, of overlooking 
 and signing important papers, when, without one word of 
 announcement, the door softly opened, and Blossom, with 
 downcast eyes, and folded hands, stood before him. 
 
 " Well, my child/' he said, in his pleasant, cheerful tones, 
 "what do you want so bright and early in the morning?" 
 
 " Bennie's life, please sir," faltered Blossom. 
 
 " Bennie ? Who is Bennie ? " 
 
 " My brother, sir. They are going to shoot him for 
 sleeping at his post." 
 
 " Oh, yes," and Mr. Lincoln ran his eye over the papers 
 before him. "I remember! It was a fatal sleep. You see, 
 child, it was at a time of special danger. Thousands of lives 
 might have been lost for his culpable negligence." 
 
 "So my father said," replied Blossom, gravely; "but poor 
 Bennie was so tired, sir, and Jemmie so weak. He did the 
 work of two, sir, and it was Jemmie's night, not his ; but 
 Jemmie was tired, and Bennie never thought about himself, 
 that he was tired to. 
 
 "What is this you say, child? Come here; I do not 
 understand," and the kind man caught eagerly, as ever, at 
 what seemed to be a justification of an offense.

 Blossom went to him : he put his hand tenderly on her 
 shoulder, and turned up the pale, anxious face toward his. 
 How tall he seemed, and he was President of the United 
 States too ! A dim thought of this kind passed for a mo- 
 ment through Blossom's mind ; but she told her simple 
 and straightforward story, and handed Mr. Lincoln Ben- 
 nie's letter to read. 
 
 He read it carefully ; then, taking up his pen, wrote a 
 few hasty lines, and rang his bell. 
 
 Blossom heard this order given : " Send this dispatch 
 
 at ONCE." 
 
 The President then turned to the girl and said : " Go 
 home, my child, and tell that father of yours, who could 
 approve his country's sentence, even when it took the life 
 of a child like that, that Abraham Lincoln thinks the life 
 far too precious to be lost. Go back, or — wait until to- 
 morrow ; Bennie will need a change after he has so bravely 
 faced death ; he shall go with you." 
 
 "God bless you, sir," said Blossom ; and who shall doubt 
 that God heard and registered the request ? 
 
 Two days after this interview, the young soldier came to 
 the White House with his little sister. He was called into 
 the President's private room, and a strap fastened " upon 
 the shoulder." Mr. Lincoln then said: "The soldier that 
 could carry a sick comrade's baggage, and die for the act so 
 uncomplainingly, deserves well of his country." Then Ben- 
 nie and Blossom took their way to their Green Mountain 
 home. A crowd gathered at the Mill Depot to welcome 
 them back; and as farmer Owen's hand grasped that of his 
 boy, tears flowed down his cheeks, and he was heard to say 
 fervently, " The Lord be praised ! "

 1. The feast was o'er. Xow brimming wine, 
 In lordly cup, was seen to shine 
 
 Before each eager guest ; 
 And silence filled the crowded hall 
 As deep as when the herald's call 
 
 Thrills in the loyal breast. 
 
 2. Then up arose the noble host, 
 
 And, smiling, cried : " A toast ! A toast ! 
 
 To all our ladies fair ; 
 Here, before all, I pledge the name 
 Of Santon's proud and beauteous dame, 
 
 The Lady Gundamere." 
 
 3. Quick to his feet each gallant sprang, 
 Aud joyous was the shout that rang, 
 
 As Stanley gave the word; 
 And every cup was raised on high, 
 Nor ceased the loud and gladsome cry 
 
 Till Stanley's voice was heard.

 And lowly bent his haughty head ; 
 " That all may have their due, 
 Xow each in turn must play his part 
 And pledge the lady of his heart, 
 Like gallant knight and true." 
 
 5. Then, one by one, each guest sprang up, 
 And drained in turn the brimming cup, 
 
 And named the loved one's name; 
 And, each, as hand on high he raised, 
 His lady's grace and beauty praised, 
 
 Her constancy and fame.

 On him are fixed those countless eyes ; 
 
 A gallant knight is he ; 
 Envied by some, admired by all. 
 Far famed in lady's bower and hall, 
 
 The flower of chivalry.

 And held the sparkling cup on high : 
 
 " I drink to one/' he said, 
 " Whose image never may depart 
 Deep graven on this grateful heart, 
 Till memory be dead ; 
 
 8. " To one whose love for me shall last 
 
 When lighter passions long have past, 
 
 So deep it is and pure ; 
 Whose love hath longer dwelt, I ween, 
 Than any yet that pledged have been 
 
 By these brave knights before." 
 
 9. Each guest upstarted at the word, 
 And laid a hand upon his sword 
 
 With fiery-flashing eye ; 
 And Stanley said : " We crave the name, 
 Proud knight, of this most peerless dame, 
 
 Whose love you count so high." 
 
 10. St. Leon paused, as if he would 
 
 Not .breathe her name in careless mood 
 
 Thus lightly to another ; 
 Then bent his noble head, as though 
 To give that word the reverence due, 
 And gently said, " My mother."

LECTURING. 
 
 The business of lecturing, is now so popular in many 
 places, that it is regarded as almost a special profession. 
 By it, the best thoughts and the most valuable experience 
 of the best men and women, are presented to the public in 
 the most effective manner. Many persons who do not ap- 
 preciate or even understand the productions of good writers, 
 will readily acknowledge the power and influence of an able 
 lecturer. It really seems that " truths divine come mended 
 from the tongue " of a good speaker. 
 
 A successful lecturer is supposed to be a person who has 
 not only learned much from books, but has also gained 
 much from travel and observation. Yet there are many 
 such persons who can accomplish little or nothing, when 
 attempting to speak in public, on account of a lack of rhe- 
 torical discipline. There can be no doubt that the principal 
 secret of success on the part of the lecturer or orator, is his 
 elocutionary power. For with most people, " It does not 
 matter so much about the character of your compositions, 
 as how they are pronounced." 
 
 I do not wish to lead the student into the error of suppos- 
 ing that it is not essential, that a lecture should be carefully 
 prepared. Indeed, the better the thought and sentiment 
 are, the better opportunity there is for good elocution. It 
 is a great mistake to suppose that many good speeches are 
 the result of simply a sudden elocutionary effort, made

 under the inspiration of genius. Charles Sumner carefully 
 revised one of his greatest speeches four times, before de- 
 livering it in the United States Senate. But, mark you, af- 
 ter preparing his speech with such great care, he delivered it. 
 
 In the preparation of original orations or lectures, the 
 most common fault to which young speakers are addicted, is 
 to suppose that they can not succeed well, unless they deal 
 with grand and sublime ideas, expressed in peculiarly classi- 
 cal terms: and in the delivery of their productions, it is 
 often evident that their thoughts are concentrated more upon 
 themselves, than upon their subjects. Great anxiety is 
 frequently manifested in efforts to display much learning 
 and superior mental ability. We have been alternately 
 amused and disgusted, in listening to a youth of sixteen or 
 eighteen years of age, vainly endeavoring to express borrow- 
 ed ideas, which are within the comprehension of only mature 
 and well informed minds. The pedantic youth, in his public 
 addresses, always wishes to say something about "ancient 
 Greece and Rome;" "the Dark Ages;" "the dim and misty 
 past;" "the arts and sciences;" "the present age of the 
 world;" "the great continent of America;" "the grand 
 and glorious universe ; " " the celestial grandeur of the 
 ethereal blue ; " etc. Now the sooner such aspirants come 
 down to the earth we live upon, and talk about practical 
 matters which they know something about, the sooner will 
 they accomplish something in their rhetorical efforts. The 
 student is here warned against all attempts to make a show 
 of himself. In presuming to give expression to original 
 thought and feeling, be honest; be earnest; be yourself; taking 
 care, however, to use every opportunity for improving 
 yourself. 
 
 We have observed that pedantry is not confined alone to

 young speakers. Some lecturers of ability and erudition, 
 seem to have accomplished their purpose when they have 
 mystified their ideas in the use of a set of words which their 
 hearers do not understand. Others delight in dealing in 
 such abstract ideas, and in indulging in such metaphysical 
 speculations, that to follow T them, is a task which few of 
 their hearers perform. The custom of using Greek and 
 Latin terms, when addressing persons who know nothing 
 about these languages, is a form of pedantry w r hich ought 
 to be met w r ith demonstrations of ridicule. The student 
 should understand in the beginning, that in order to succeed 
 well, he must not only study his subject, but he must also 
 study his audience ; then the degree of intelligence, and even 
 the prejudices of the audience should determine, to some 
 extent, the form and style of the lecture. We understand 
 that the principal objects of public speaking, are, to instruct 
 the people, and persuade them to do right ; and the only 
 way to accomplish those objects, is, to make your hearers 
 understand and feel what you say. 
 
 If a lecture is first written in full, and is worth hearing, 
 it is w r orth committing to memory, in order that it may be 
 delivered in a proper manner. The style in which we often 
 see addresses read from manuscript, is almost intolerable. 
 If the ideas and language of a discourse are not borrowed 
 or stolen, the task of committing it to memory is not a diffi- 
 cult one. Hence, there is little excuse for being tied to a 
 manuscript. If notes are used, and the speaker gives more 
 attention to the notes that to his audience, the audience will 
 generally return the compliment, by giving more attention 
 to something else than to him. 
 
 It will be observed in the lecture which follows, that the 
 matter demands a variety of pitch, time, force, tone, and

 manner. And without these varieties of vocal expression 
 and manner, the student need not expect to hold the atten- 
 tion of an audience, throughout any discourse of considera- 
 ble length. 
 
 The student will also observe that the historic present, or 
 extraordinary form of elocution is frequently used. When 
 this form of description can be well used, it is always better* 
 to do so. But when not well used, in all original discourses 
 it defeats the speaker's own purpose.— W. H. Fertich.

MANHOOD, 
 
 A special definition of the term manhood, is the state 
 of being a man ; manly quality ; courage, bravery, firmness, 
 and resolution. A more general meaning of the term is 
 that degree of excellence in the masculine character, which 
 ought to command our respect and admiration. 
 
 I have a hope that this occasion will be of some interest 
 to the ladies present, because I am convinced that there is 
 nothing "under the sun," in which a woman is so much 
 interested, as in a good specimen of manhood. I do not 
 mean that there is a good specimen before you for examina- 
 tion, I only mean that your attention will be called to some 
 of the qualities which go to make up true manhood. 
 
 There was a time when a superior type of manhood was sup- 
 posed to consist of only a high degree of physical strength. 
 At that time, the strongest men physically, were made kings 
 and the weakest ones were killed. Among the aborigines 
 of this country, the men of influence and authority needed 
 only to possess superior physical skill and cunning, united 
 with a very low type of bravery. With such ideas of man- 
 hood, it is not surprising that women were assigned positions 
 of subordination and servility. The savage who would 
 have deigned to treat his wife with respect, and as though 
 she were his equal, would have been derisively ostracised. 
 He would have been considered altogether too unmanly to 
 be ranked as an equal with his fellows. Xo such thing as 
 gallantry, in the social sense, was known among them.

 Thus we see that a barbarous people may, in some respects, 
 sink below the level of even the brute creation. 
 
 The mistaken ideas of the ancients, in regard to true 
 manhood, were certainly deplorable. Yet it does not fol- 
 low, that all the people with whom we have to do, are very 
 far removed from the moral condition of the Antediluvians, 
 or the natives of America. While many understand full 
 well that muscle does not make the man, they are greatly 
 mistaken in regard to the qualities which do make the man. 
 
 Every teacher should not forget that his pupils are 
 educated, in part, by the examples set before them in society. 
 Hence, every boy in ,the land has certain imbibed ideas of 
 manhood, whether they be false or true. He has his ideal 
 man in view, and is constantly forming his character in ac- 
 cordance with the model. Not only the patriot, the philan- 
 thropist, and the Christian gentleman furnish examples 
 which are studied and imitated, but the circus rider, with 
 his pompous display of physical skill and daring; the 
 pugilist, with his display of animal strength and courage ; 
 the fop, with his gaudy dress, his wonderful appreciation of 
 hair, and his lack of brains ; the other shams of society, who 
 delight in simulation and dissimulation ; who anxiously 
 labor to appear to be what they are not, and not to be what 
 they are ; whose happiness is dependent upon the cut of a 
 coat, the fit of a boot, the style of a hat, or the prospect of a 
 mustache : all these and many worse characters combine to 
 furnish the strong delusions to which many boys and young 
 men become the victims. To dispel these delusions, and to 
 develop the ability which enables a youth to detect a coun- 
 terfeit gentleman, ought to be the cherished ambition of 
 every faithful teacher. 
 
 But what are some of the results of this society teaching ?

 First of these, I allude to the foolish estimate placed upon 
 dress. It is proper for teachers to recognize the fact, that 
 the ability to dress well, is considered essential to manhood. 
 Indeed, this ability is prized so highly, on the part of some, 
 that they cultivate no other. Now to dress neatly and sen- 
 sibly, is proper and in keeping with good taste, but it by 
 no means follows that it is an element of manhood. There 
 are many degraded villians, entirely destitute of any manly 
 quality, who can dress more elegantly than men who have 
 rendered themselves deservedly immortal. The young man 
 who delights in making a display of a huge watch chain ; 
 who is bedecked with rings, charms, and other gewgaws, 
 and supposes that these articles add to his dignity and 
 worth, stands in great need of instruction : and the teacher 
 who makes a display of extra appendages of gilt ornament 
 before his pupils, does them harm. 
 
 There are several reasons for believing that God in- 
 tended women to be the ornamental part of society; and 
 the ornamentation of a good looking lady, seems eminently 
 proper; but all efforts to ornament a man, are about as 
 pertinent as to put a lace collar on a monkey. 
 
 It is possible to tell a great deal about a man, from his 
 dress, provided it be of a foppish character; otherwise it is 
 unfair to estimate a man from his dress : for 
 
 u Who shall judge a man from nature? 
 
 AVho shall know him by his dress? 
 Paupers may be fit lor princes.

 In judging of a man from his appearance only, no other 
 article of apparel has so much to do with the estimate made, 
 as the hat he wears. In many places, I notice a prejudice 
 in favor of the tall, silk hat. Even railway conductors, 
 brakemen, and men filling other public positions, will gen- 
 erally treat a man more civilly, answer his questions more 
 politely, if he is wearing what they call a "plug" hat. It 
 is a great mistake to suppose that this style of hat is an ex- 
 ponent of manhood, since it is worn by the most stupid 
 dunces and silly ignoramuses, as well as by many real men. 
 I have nothing to say for or against any style of hat, I 
 only insist that one's manhood is not in his hat. " The 
 dress does not make the man," and "All is not gold that 
 glitters," are adages containing depths of meaning, which 
 every teacher should demonstrate ; and this he should do in 
 behalf of the common intelligence of those under his care. 
 
 The next delusion to which I invite your attention, is the 
 use of tobacco. It is a fact, that nearly every boy or man 
 who has contracted the habit of using tobacco, did so be- 
 cause he thought it was a manly habit. Who has not ob- 
 served the spurious dignity which a young man assumes, 
 when he has sufficiently deadened his nervous sensibility to 
 endure the sickening narcotic? Notice, if you please, the 
 peculiar air of importance which a young man assumes in 
 the manipulation of a cigar, after the most approved fash- 
 ion : the usual slant of the cigar at an angle of twenty or 
 thirty degrees from a horizontal ; its position between the 
 first and second fingers, and the skillful stroke of the little 
 finger in disposing of the ashes on the burning end. All 
 these demonstrations are familiar parts of this most bogus 
 exhibition of manhood. 
 
 I am aware that there are many good and earnest Chris-

 tians who use tobacco; many real gentlemen who use it; but 
 these are such as are conscious of the character of the habit, 
 and resist its unmanly tendency. 
 
 Now a hog always makes the mistake, to regard nobody 
 as more decent than he ; and many tobacco users make 
 exactly the same mistake. I notice school houses where 
 children ought to be taught morals and manners, and 
 churches dedicated to the worship of God, shockingly pol- 
 luted with the filthy products of this most dirty habit. On 
 railroad trains I notice men who have a mustache and 
 whiskers, and look fierce ; who wear coats and boots after 
 the latest pattern; sport an abundance of jewelry and a silk 
 hat; and who, doubtless, would be greatly insulted if it 
 were hinted that they are guilty of any unmanly conduct. 
 And yet these fellows will audaciously deposit their tobacco 
 filth about on the floor, compelling nicely dressed ladies 
 and decent men to actually wade about in it, the while 
 totally indifferent to the feelings, the taste, or even the com- 
 fort of their fellow passengers. Such conduct is anything 
 but gallant, courteous, polite or decent. 
 
 Not long since, I had the pleasure of meeting Prof. 
 Burns, author of " Burns' Grammar." We w T ere sitting in 
 the room of a hotel, when a man near us began smoking his 
 tobacco in a huge pipe. As the tobacco smoke really made 
 the Professor sick, he politely requested the man to leave 
 off smoking, at the same time giving his reasons for making 
 the request. " What ! " said the man, " do you s'pose I 
 haven't a right to smoke in here? Guess I pay my bills." 
 " No," said the Professor, " you have no more right to 
 poison my brain with your tobacco smoke, than you have 
 to render yourself a nuisance in any other way ; and more

 Mian that, it is a principle of manhood, to regard the corn- 
 fort of those about us." And the Professor was right. 
 
 My strongest hope for improvement in this matter, is in 
 the public schools of our country. When a large county in 
 Indiana has only Jive teachers who use tobacco, it seems 
 prophetic of a more decent, if not a better time in the 
 future. Let every boy understand that the use of tobacco 
 in no way elevates the degree of one's manhood, but that 
 the tendency is in the other direction. 
 
 Another habit which is deplorably common, and which 
 is contracted with the idea that it is manly, is profane 
 swearing. Now it is not my purpose to prove by the Bible 
 that swearing is wrong. I believe that the precepts and 
 commands of the Bible, ought to be respected and obeyed; 
 and that such respect and obedience ought to be exem- 
 plified in our public schools. But I prefer, on this occa- 
 sion, to consider profanity only in its relation to a merely 
 respectable manhood. 
 
 There is no escaping the deduction, that profanity is a 
 very gross form of vice, for which there is not even the 
 most flimsy excuse. It is usually practiced by those who 
 have no command of good language, and who suppose that 
 to be earnest and emphatic, they must be profane. Pro- 
 fanity is especially the language of the refuse of mankind, 
 the worthless, the degraded, the vile, and those who merely 
 hang on at the tail-end of society. I am aware that some 
 may say, and do say, " I know of a great statesman, and a 
 brave general, who use profane language, and they are cer- 
 tainly superior types of manhood." I know there are men 
 of great intellect, bravery, and chivalry, who are so 
 morally deformed as to use profane language. But their 
 profanity is no part of their intelligence; their profanity

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 193 
 
 is 110 part of their bravery ; their profanity is no part of 
 any of their commendable qualities; neither do any of 
 their commendable qualities in any way atone for their pro- 
 fanity. Profanity helps no man's ability^ bravery, chiv- 
 alry, manners, or any part of his manhood. While it is 
 true that a man may be intellectually grand, and at the 
 same time morally deformed, it is equally true, that if a 
 man is morally deformed, he is deficient in the highest and 
 best part of his manhood. 
 
 There is probably no sane person who does not believe in 
 the existence of a God, and that he is the author and propri- 
 etor of all things, and infinitely wise and good. This being 
 the case, how unaccountably astonishing it is, that any but 
 an insane person can use the name of God for low and vul- 
 gar purposes ! A man does not wish the name of his w r ife 
 to be used more often than is necessary, and when her name 
 is used, he is particular about it being used respectfully. A 
 young man of honor, would not permit the name of his 
 mother, or his sister, to be tossed about from lip to lip by 
 foul-mouthed men, for vulgar purposes. And yet theie are 
 men who will sweep out of heaven, as it were, all the sacred 
 appellations of the Deity, use them to point the edge of 
 their evil passions, in the expression of the most degraded 
 thoughts that a polluted mind is capable of conceiving. If 
 there is good reason for being careful of the manner in 
 which the name of a friend is used, there is much greater 
 reason for being careful of the manner in which the name 
 of God is used. 
 
 Let us suppose that a man does not believe in any system 
 of Christian religion, or even in the existence of God, and 
 that he habitually uses profane language in the presence of 
 other people. Such conduct is, nevertheless, unmanly, be-

194 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 cause there are those continually about us, who do believe 
 in a system of Christian religion, and who greatly respect 
 and reverence their Creator. And to use profane language 
 in the presence or hearing of such people, is to do great 
 violence to their feelings. If I am a Christian, and try to 
 serve God and keep his commandments, a man has no more 
 right to swear in my ear, than he has to insult my father 01^ 
 mother. It does not require a high degree of manhood, or 
 even of common decency, to have a respect for the intelli- 
 gent opinions and feelings of those about us, and yet we 
 find scores and hundreds of men continually pouring out 
 their billingsgate and profanity, into the ears of Christian 
 people, entirely regardless of their suffering. 
 
 In this connection it is proper to bear in mind, that the 
 highest, noblest, and most sacred thoughts of men, are 
 involved in their religion, no matter what that religion is : 
 in their ideas of God and the Savior, of heaven and the fu- 
 ture life. And if my neighbor is living in the faith of God, 
 and believes that it is by the death of the Savior that he is 
 spared, and has gathered around these names the sweetest 
 thoughts and the purest sanctities of which the soul is 
 capable, and has dressed them with all that is beautiful in 
 this life and the life to come ; so that all he is, and all he 
 expects to be, are involved in them, then who is he that 
 dares to profane the sanctity of these emotions, by indulging 
 in his presence in vile and villianous oaths ! To do so, is 
 to be guilty of the coarsest rudeness, the most cruel impo- 
 liteness, and, therefore, unmanly conduct toward those peo- 
 ple to whom God's name is sweet and sacred. 
 
 It is a notorious fact, that men and boys do most of the 
 swearing in this country. Comparatively few women 
 swear. It is thought to be a horrid practice for a woman 
 


## p. 195 (#201) ############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 195 
 
 to swear, and so it is; but it is time that all our young 
 people were taught what many older persons have failed to 
 learn, that it is just as improper for a man to swear, as it is 
 for a woman to swear. The notion, that it is so much 
 worse for a woman to smoke a cigar, or use profane lan- 
 guage than for a man to do so, has no foundation whatever 
 in logic or justice. A respectable young lady ought to be 
 just as much ashamed to publicly court the favor of a vul- 
 gar, profane, and drunken young man, as the young man is 
 to be seen in the company of a vulgar, profane, and 
 drunken young woman. By all means, let a man's man- 
 hood be estimated by the same moral standard, as a 
 woman's womanhood ; and let the brand of social ostracism 
 be applied as promptly and vigorously in the one case, as 
 in the other. 
 
 But I can not further discuss this topic now T . I trust 
 that my fellow teachers will. For the teacher, who fails to 
 study the character and consequences of this evil, and to 
 instruct his pupils in the same, fails in the discharge of a 
 very plain duty. 
 
 I come now to consider a quality which has usually been 
 looked upon as the very essence of manhood; namely, the 
 quality of courage or bravery. A spirit of bravery has 
 always been admired, even by women; and fondly cher- 
 ished and sedulously cultivated by men. There is scarcely 
 any thing more insulting to the average man, than to be 
 branded as a coward. That there is a kind of courage 
 which belongs to true manhood, is certainly true ; and that 
 there is a kind of courage which belongs to true doghood, 
 is equally true. That kind of courage which prompts a 
 man to resent the application of those foul epithets, which 
 only indecent men use; that kind of courage which

196 INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 
 
 prompts a boy to fight another because he calls him hard 
 names; that kind of courage which supports the pugilist 
 in his animal profession; that kind of courage which 
 courts opportunities for street brawls and fisticuffs; in 
 short, that kind of courage which is nothing more than a 
 lower-animal ferocity, is especially the kind of courage 
 that belongs to doghood. 
 
 How strange that any man should condescend to emulate 
 the lower animals in a matter, in which he can not hope to 
 excel! He ought to know that so far as mere animal 
 ferocity is concerned, a common dog is always a man's 
 equal, and a tiger is greatly his superior. 
 
 There is an essential difference, between animal courage 
 and manly courage, which every school boy ought to under- 
 stand. For too many young men suppose that a prostration 
 of moral principle, and a stifling of all kindly and sympa- 
 thetic feeling, are necessary to a possession of real courage. 
 Such young men usually carry about their persons, revol- 
 vers, knives, and other death-dealing instruments. Now, 
 the custom of carrying deadly weapons in this country, in 
 times of peace, under ordinary circumstances, is simply a 
 proof of cowardice, of w r hich no truly brave man is guilty. 
 
 In the late war, a regiment was raised in one of our 
 northern cities, composed entirely of street rowdies, and 
 men who were notorious for rushing into brawls, with 
 bow T ie-knife and pistol. It was supposed that these men 
 would make capital soldiers, and distinguish themselves in 
 the service by their contempt of all danger. But as might 
 have been reasonably expected, they utterly failed to make 
 any honorable record. They could kill a man in the city at 
 night, and rob him, but as soldiers, they were cowardly, 
 unreliable and worthless. They only illustrated the fact,

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 197 
 
 that coarseness, roughness, brutality and wickedness, are 
 not essential elements in the character of a brave man. 
 
 in an Indiana regiment of which I had the honor to be a 
 member, there was a Captain who was noted as a pugilist. 
 When we were in camp and out of danger, he would fight 
 the men of his own company, and the men of other com- 
 panies. But I remember that, in the battle of Franklin, 
 our Brigadier General justly branded him as a coward, for 
 having failed to perform a duty assigned him. 
 
 I think the pugilist sustains the same relation to a gen- 
 tleman, that a worthless cur does to the most faithful and 
 useful of his species. An Englishman once offered to bet a 
 large sum of money, that when a certain terrier which he 
 owned, was engaged in fighting, he would suffer three of his 
 legs to be cut off, without relinquishing his hold. The bet 
 was taken, and the dogs were set to fighting, when the 
 brute actually suffered one leg to be taken off after another, 
 and finally suffered death rather than cease to fight. When 
 I think of this incident, I scarcely know w r hich animal to 
 pity more, the ferocious quadruped, or the brutal biped, 
 who could engage in such inhuman business and call it 
 sport. While this species of the dog is remarkable for his 
 ferocity and endurance, he possesses no other quality which 
 commends him to our admiration. He is the meanest, most 
 unreliable and worthless dog among dogs. So, I think, the 
 pugilist is the meanest, most unreliable, and worthless man 
 among men. 
 
 Every boy should understand that Christian gentility and 
 manly courage are entirely compatible, and that the latter 
 quality is most frequently found where the former exists. 
 Indeed, the loftiest courage, the most daring bravery, and 
 the grandest heroism, have been exhibited in the lives and

 deaths of moral and Christian men. Many examples are 
 convenient, some of which could be presented to the pupils 
 of our public schools, with great profit. Washington and 
 many of his cotemporary countrymen were splendid ex- 
 amples. Col. Ellsworth and the whole company of men he 
 raised for the government service, were good examples. 
 Ah, what a splendid array of manly fellows ! Not one of j 
 whom used tobacco or intoxicating liquors; not one of 
 whom used profane language; not one of whom gambled 
 or indulged in the vices of the camp; all gallantly rushing 
 to the defense of their country, and a more efficient com- 
 pany of soldiers never took part in a hotly contested battle. 
 And when their virtuous and daring leader espies a rebel 
 flag displayed above the roof of a hotel in Alexandria, he 
 rushes up the stairway, to haul down the flag of treason, 
 and as he descends with it in his hand, is brutally shot by 
 an enemy to the government, which Ellsworth cherished 
 with unbounded, patriotic devotion. Indignation is 
 blended with the tears we shed, when such specimens of 
 manhood are sacrificed upon the altar of our country. 
 
 For another example, I refer with pride to the brave and 
 efficient Commodore Foote. On the Sabbath before he 
 started on the expedition for the capture of Forts Henry 
 and Donelson, he attended, as was his custom, the public 
 worship of God, at Cairo, Illinois. For some reason the 
 minister did not appear. The Commodore ascended the 
 steps to the pulpit, offered a fervent prayer, took a text 
 from the Bible, spoke briefly from it and exhorted his fellow 
 soldiers and the people, to put their trust in God and keep 
 his commandments. And when his flag-ship is under the 
 severest fire from Fort Donelson, the heavy shot rattling 
 like thunder-bolts about him, the pilot in mangled death at

 his side, and himself severely wounded, he is cool, calm and 
 hopeful in the discharge of his duties, anxious only for his 
 men, and the cause for which he is shedding his blood. No 
 wonder his men had such confidence in their grand, old 
 Commander! 2?b wonder they declared they would go 
 wherever he commanded them ! No wonder he was suc- 
 cessful in his perilous undertakings! Had the Federal 
 Army been officered throughout, with such splendid men as 
 Commodore Foote, the Rebellion would have been crushed 
 in half the time it took, and with half the cost of blood and 
 treasure. 
 
 In the little city of Muncie, Indiana, there lives a man 
 whose modesty, gentility, and Christian bearing, do not 
 point him out as a man of any special bravery. A common 
 rowdy would, doubtless, take him to be a coward. The 
 man to whom I refer, is Lieut. Henry Swain. When our 
 regiment was hotly engaged before Nashville, Lieut. Swain 
 lost his horse. In the retreat that followed, I noticed him 
 at my side, making his way on foot. Knowing that he was 
 fatigued, I offered him my horse to ride a part of the way. 
 u No, thank you," said he, "I think I can reach the main 
 line in safety." But the main line fell back about a mile 
 farther, making the distance too great for him to pass on 
 foot, and he was taken prisoner. Not, however, until he 
 had fired his last shot and was surrounded by a half-dozen 
 rebel cavalry-men. And when on board the ill-fated Sul- 
 tana, he was by her explosion, thrown at night into the 
 swollen waters of the Mississippi, he had the presence of 
 mind to save himself, and the courage to save others who 
 would have perished but for his assistance. There is not a 
 braver man in his state than Lieut. Swain ; neither is there 
 a more peaceable and pleasant gentleman.

 A pernicious error into which many young men are led, 
 is to suppose that courage is a negative quality, whereas, it 
 is positive. True courage is not the absence of something, it 
 is the presence of something. It has been well said, that 
 
 "The brave man is not he who feels no fear, 
 For that were stupid and irrational ; 
 But he whose noble soul his fear subdues, 
 And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from.*' 
 
 The best illustration of this truth that ever came under 
 my own observation, was furnished by the gallantry and 
 heroism of Lieut. Watt, of the 9th Indiana Cavalry. He 
 was placed in temporary command of a company which had 
 lost all its commissioned officers. In a charge that was 
 made near Duck River, Tennessee, his company was as- 
 signed a position immediately on an open pike. Besides 
 the infantry that were to be encountered, the pike was 
 swept by two pieces of artillery. Lieut. Watt was not so 
 " stupid and irrational " as to be indifferent to the dangers 
 of his position, and just before the bugles sounded the 
 charge, we observed that his countenance was as pale as 
 death ; but his " noble soul " enabled him to be true to his 
 trust and to prove that he was the man for the place. As 
 the horses press forward into a quick trot, and then into a 
 gallop, the Lieutenant is seen at the head of his company, 
 and with nearly every leap of his large, black horse, he cries 
 out, in a clear and steady voice, "Charge 'em, boys! 
 Charge 'em, boys ! " Then, with coolness and precision, he 
 proceeds to deliver to the enemy the contents of one of his 
 revolvers. But when he has fired only two or three shots, 
 he throws up his hands and falls backward from his horse. 
 And when sadly we picked him up from the spot where he

 fell, we noticed that his body was pierced by three of the 
 enemy's bullets. But because Lieut. Watt turned pale and 
 seemed deeply agitated, did he not give proof of cowardice ? 
 I say no; that only proved that he appreciated the dangers 
 of his position. To rush into battle without thought of 
 danger, requires imbecility and down-right stupidity ; and 
 these qualities are negative and do not belong to manly 
 courage. 
 
 In the exhibition of manly courage, it is not so necessary 
 to stifle the natural instinct of self-preservation, as it is to 
 govern that instinct by an earnest desire to accomplish a 
 good purpose. It is this noble purpose, together with the 
 energy and perseverance to carry out that purpose, that 
 constitutes the requisite for any really brave act. 
 
 Picture to your minds a calm, moonlit sea, over whose 
 tranquil bosom is gliding in solemn majesty, a splendid 
 ship. Among the dark forms upon her deck may be dis- 
 cerned a pale-faced boy, some sixteen years old. He is 
 leaning over the bulwarks, absorbed in dreamy reverie. 
 His imagination is traversing the future of his career. 
 Filled with the gay illusions of hope, he peoples the years 
 to come with images of success. He beholds himself 
 rising from post to post in his dangerous profession, till he 
 fancies himself the commander of a great fleet. He wins 
 brilliant victories; wealth, honors, fame surrounded him. 
 He is a great man. His name is in the mouth of the 
 world. There is a circle of glory round his brow. Filled 
 with the idea, he starts. His young heart heaving with 
 great purposes, his eyes gleaming with the fire of his en- 
 kindled soul, his slender form expanding to its utmost 
 height, and his lips moving with energy, he paces the silent 
 deck, exclaiming, " I will be a hero; and, trusting in Provi-

 dence, I will brave every danger." Such was the romantic 
 dream, and the courageous determination of young Horatio 
 Nelson, afterward the hero of the Nile, the victor of Tra- 
 falgar, and the greatest naval commander in the world. 
 Much like his purpose, was that of the young man who 
 said, " AVhile I calculate upon difficulty in the battle of life,^ 
 I calculate also upon success. And the only condition 
 upon which I predicate this proposition, is, if the Lord is 
 willing. For I am determined," said he, "that not even 
 the Devil, with all his slaves and co-workers, shall ever 
 cheat me out of an honorable distinction and a good 
 name." 
 
 A man who is really brave will do whatever he believes 
 is right, regardless of the expressed opinion of others. A 
 man who accepts a challenge to fight a duel for fear of being 
 called a coward, only gives proof of his cowardice. 
 
 When, in the spring of 1856, Charles Sumner was 
 assailed in the Senate chamber by Preston S. Brooks, for 
 words spoken in debate, Henry Wilson, on the floor of the 
 Senate, characterized that act as " Brutal, murderous, and 
 cowardly." These words drew forth a challenge from 
 Brooks, to which Mr. Wilson replied in words which ought 
 to give him ever enduring honor. He said, " I have always 
 regarded duelling as a lingering relic of barbarism, which 
 the law of the country has branded as a crime. While, 
 therefore, I religiously believe in the right of self-defense, 
 in its broadest sense, the law of my country, and the 
 matured convictions of my whole life, alike forbid me to 
 meet you for the purpose indicated in your letter." This 
 noble response to the representative of counterfeit chivalry, 
 was quite effectual. He had no desire to prosecute a quarrel 
 with a man who " religiously believed in the right of self-

 defense in its broadest sense/' and he wisely concluded to 
 let Mr. Wilson alone. 
 
 A company of gentlemen was once assembled, among 
 whom were Col. Payne and Gen. Washington. Some sub- 
 ject arose which caused considerable discussion. The differ- 
 ence of opinion was so decided, that in the warmth of the 
 debate, the General, departing from his usual manner, 
 applied some offensive epithet to Col. Payne. This so 
 offended the Colonel that he sprang to his feet and struck 
 the General so violently as to knock him down. At this, 
 the others interfered and prevented further difficulty. At 
 that time, it was the custom among g^itlemen when one was 
 offended, to challenge the offender to fight a duel. And as 
 the General had received a blow 7 , it was expected that he 
 would challenge Col. Payne to meet him with deadly 
 weapons and wipe out the insult in blood. But the great 
 Washington, in this case as in many others, taught them 
 and us an important lesson in true manhood. Meeting 
 Col. Payne soon after, he advanced toward him with extended 
 hand, and said, " Col. Payne, I used language to you that 
 w T as unbecoming a gentleman, and you knocked me down. 
 If you have had satisfaction, now let us be friends." 
 Washington possessed that grand, moral courage, which 
 enabled him to apologize to a friend, when he had done him 
 an injury. And no man who is in the possession of genuine 
 courage, will allow a spurious dignity to prevent him from 
 making an apology when it is due. Pupils ought to be 
 taught to apologize for wrong conduct, and teachers ought 
 to have the courage to apologize to their pupils, if by hasty 
 or thoughtless conduct, the feelings of a pupil have been 
 injured. 
 
 Courage is a matter of education, and teachers ought to

 see well to the development of this valuable quality. The 
 study of history and biography is, doubtless, well calcu- 
 lated to develop a patriotic courage. But there is another 
 kind of courage with which the teacher is more directly 
 concerned, and which pertains to the more ordinary duties 
 of life. I refer simply to self-possession in the discharge of 
 duty. Especially that self-possession which enables one to 
 appear before a public audience without being afraid of 
 himself and his friends. There is certainly much greater 
 reason for being frightened at an army of enemies, than at 
 an audience of friends, though the former, I believe, is 
 considered much moje dishonorable. The person who is 
 frightened by appearing before an audience, usually ex- 
 hibits the same symptoms, that attend any other kind of 
 fright. It is noticeable that his respirations are very fre- 
 quent, which proves that the heart is beating too rapidly. 
 Sometimes his face is red, sometimes, pale ; and regardless 
 of the temperature, his perspiration is unusually profuse. 
 And if he is not frightened, I want to know what is the 
 matter with him. Take for example the man who was 
 elected to the legislature of his state, but who, unfortun- 
 ately, had not developed any ability for speaking in public. 
 When the legislature was in session, a question came before 
 that body, upon which he felt it to be his duty to say some- 
 thing. His conversation in private was good enough, but 
 on this occasien when he arose,, he stammered, stuttered, 
 blundered, and amid the roars of the house, sat down with- 
 out#having succeeded in saying any thing that he intended 
 to say. I am informed that his case was something like 
 this: "Mr. Speaker, I — I — I am sensible — I — I am in- 
 deed, that — th — that — though I — I sh — sh — should want — 
 should want words, why — why — why I must proceed.

 And, for the first time in my life, I — I — I think — I think 
 that no man sh — sh — should sh — sh — shrink, and therefore 
 for — for one, I — I — I'll — I'll speak out freely. Ho — ho — 
 hold on ! I'm — I'm not yet done. In — In the name of 
 those honorable men who — who sent me here to — to — to — 
 to speak for them,- why — why, as I said before, to — to — to — 
 to do my duty to my constituency, why — w T hy — I — I — I'll 
 — I'll — I'll say no more," Even the kind of courage 
 which enables a man to face a cannon and fight a battle, 
 will not always support him when facing an audience. I 
 know of no better place to develop this much needed 
 ability, than in the public schools of our country; and I 
 know of but little of our education that is more practical 
 or important. 
 
 From what has been said, it would be inferred that 
 knowledge and discipline are necessary to the possession of 
 true manhood. While most persons agree in this fact, there 
 are many who continually deceive themselves by placing 
 too great an estimate on that kind of social culture, which 
 simply enables a young man to pass himself w r ell in the 
 social forms of society. It is this superficial social culture 
 that enables a young man to win the affections of a young 
 lady, of whom he is not at all worthy ; and sad indeed must 
 be the life, and gloomy the prospect of that young woman, 
 when, too late, she learns that these merely social accom- 
 plishments may exist, without having any foundation what- 
 ever in the principles of true manhood. 
 
 \\e obtain this social culture, by mingling in good 
 society and practicing its customs. Persons who live in 
 sparsely settled districts, have few opportunities for culti- 
 vating this social ability, and are sometimes called "country 
 Jakes." In cities, the social powers are very early, and

 often prematurely developed. It seems that the premature 
 development of the social powers, has a tendency to beget 
 a conceit on the part of boys and young men, which is a 
 great disadvantage to them. Some of them flatter them- 
 selves that they are wiser than their parents or teachers, 
 and have little respect and no reverence for any of their 
 superiors. Not so with those "country Jakes." Feeling 
 their need of knowledge and discipline, they are teachable 
 and anxious to be instructed from whatever source possible. 
 Hence, the reason, that so great a proportion of them be- 
 come our most eminent and useful men. Abraham Lincoln 
 was a striking specimen of a "country Jake," and an 
 American President, of whom this great nation is justly 
 proud. 
 
 It is of vital importance that every boy should under- 
 stand, that obedience to all proper authority, is an element of 
 success in life, and therefore an element of true manhood. 
 
 It is related that an English farmer once sent a boy to 
 guard a gate, in order to prevent a party of huntsmen from 
 passing through a certain field. The hunting party proved 
 to be none other than the Duke of Wellington and some of 
 his friends. One after another of the party rode up, and 
 commanded the boy to open the gate. He told each, that 
 he had been ordered by his master to keep the gate closed, 
 and that he intended to obey the orders. Threats and 
 bribes were alike offered in vain. After a while the Duke 
 himself advanced, and said, "My boy, you do not know 
 me. I am the Duke of Wellington, and one not accustomed 
 to be disobeyed, and I command you to open that gate, that 
 I and my friends may pass through." 
 
 The boy politely lifted his cap before the man whom all 
 England delighted to honor, then answered firmly: 
 


## p. 207 (#213) ############################################

INSTRUCTIVE ELOCUTION. 207 
 
 " I am sure the Duke of Wellington would not wish me 
 to disobey orders. I must keep this gate shut, nor allow 
 any one to pass without my master's permission." 
 
 Then the sturdy old warrior lifted his hat, and said : " I 
 honor the boy or the man who can neither be bribed nor 
 frightened into disobeying the orders of his master. With 
 an army of such men I could conquer, not only the French, 
 but the world." And, handing the boy a glittering sove- 
 reign, the old Duke put spurs to his horse and galloped 
 away. 
 
 I may here remark that this boy, with his exalted ideas 
 of obedience, accomplished what the great Napoleon, with 
 his gallant French army, failed to accomplish — he defeated 
 the Duke of Wellington. 
 
 One of the most deplorable results growing out of per- 
 verted view r s of social propriety, is the cruel indifference 
 with which many boys and young men regard their parents. 
 Verging into manhood so far as physical development is 
 concerned, they foolishly suppose that it is unmanly to feel 
 and manifest affection for their parents. And for a young 
 man to kiss *his mother, is regarded by them as positive 
 proof of childishness. Such a young man usually refers to 
 his father and mother, as "the old man" and "the old 
 woman." Let such young men know that the noble-minded 
 and heroic Ellsworth, in the last letter that he ever wrote to 
 his parents, addressed them as his " Dear Father and 
 Mother," — concluding his letter thus: "My darling and 
 ever loved parents, good by. God bless, protect, and care 
 for you." Then if any young man is in doubt about the 
 nobility, the true dignity, and manly character of Col. Ells- 
 worth, let him read this just tribute to his memory: 
 
 "Sprung from the ranks of the people, reflecting their

 impulses, sharing in their sympathies, — young, gallant, and 
 generous, — lofty of spirit, earnest of purpose, severely tem- 
 perate, combining all that youth emulates, that manhood 
 loves, and that old age admires, Col. Ellsworth was alike 
 the idol of those who knew him, and foremost in the ranks 
 of those to whom the country looked as the exemplars of 
 its youth, and the defenders of its honor." 
 
 When waiting one day for the arrival of a train at a rail- 
 way depot, I noticed a fine-looking man, about thirty years 
 of age, leading a pretty little girl by the hand. They were, 
 evidently, father and daughter. When the train arrived, 
 there were several passengers who stepped from the cars to 
 the platform, and among them was an elderly lady, who 
 proved to be the mother of the gentleman alluded to. Ap- 
 proaching her, he grasped her hand and said, " I am glad 
 to see you mother," and putting his arm about her he affec- 
 tionately kissed her. And I said, to myself, " Splendid, 
 sir ! Splendid ! "■ And I now say that his conduct was 
 commendable and manly. The young man who is ashamed 
 to kiss his mother, will soon be ashamed to kiss his wife. 
 And judging from my observation thus far in life, I am led 
 to the conclusion that a woman is not happy for any great 
 length of time, unless she is statedly kissed. 
 
 These perverted views of manly dignity, induce many 
 persons to suppose that it is unmanly to shed tears. While 
 the privilege of crying is freely accorded to any woman, it 
 is believed that a man ought not to cry. The fact is, the 
 man who sheds tears under peculiar circumstances, gives 
 proof of strength rather than weakness, and shows that he is 
 in possession of a quality that is eminently human. The 
 school-boy who confesses his guilt, and is sufficiently humil- 
 iated to shed tears, deserves honor, and ought to be com-

 mended by his teacher; while the jeers of his more imbecile 
 companions, ought to meet with prompt and severe censure. 
 The idea that it is unmanly to shed tears, has no foundation 
 in sense or propriety. When the great patriot of France, 
 Gen. La Payette, visited this country in 18*24, and stood by 
 the grave of Washington, he icept over the remains of his 
 departed friend. When the brave Gen. Fremont was or- 
 dered to send his best regiments East, leaving his friend, 
 Gen. Lyon unsupported and in danger, he cried about the 
 matter, not like a child, but like a man. When the gallant 
 Colonel of the 57th Indiana Regiment, saw his men falling 
 thick and fast around him before Atlanta, he cried like a 
 man and fought like a hero. When the Son of God, the 
 Savior of the world, witnessed the grief occasioned by the 
 death of Lazarus, he mingled his tears with those of the be- 
 reaved friends. That stupid imbecility which prevents a 
 man from shedding tears under any circumstances, is rather 
 an abnormal condition, and does not belong to true man- 
 hood. 
 
 Our intellectual and social culture has something to do 
 with our manhood. Our merely moral culture has more to 
 do with it. But there is another power which awakens and 
 develops a manhood of which no other agent is capable. 
 For an illustration, go with me, in your imagination, to an 
 English village as it appeared some two hundred years ago. 
 As your eye wanders among its ancient cottages, with huge 
 gable-ends and roofs of thatched straw, let it rest upon a 
 group of young men, surrounding one whose mean dress 
 and bag of tools proclaim him to belong to the humble fra- 
 ternity of traveling tinkers. lie is the chief speaker in the 
 group, and his conversation is remarkable only for its extrav- 
 agant profanity. With a vulgar air, and a boisterous man-

 ner, he rolls out a filthy stream of oaths from the fountain 
 of his deeply polluted spirit. Suddenly, however, his vile 
 speech is arrested by the presence of a woman, who pushes 
 her way through the crowd, and gazing earnestly in the 
 blasphemer's face, rebukes him for his indecent language, 
 and says it makes her tremble to hear him swear. The 
 young man stands amazed and stricken under this rebuke. 
 Deep, big thoughts rush through his startled soul; he 
 inwardly but sternly resolves to be a better man. That 
 day's events form an epoch in his life. Ere long it becomes 
 known that the swearing tinker is transformed into the ex- 
 emplary Christian. Soon his voice is heard preaching 
 Christ. But persecution breaks forth against him, and he 
 is cast into prison. For twelve long years he lies confined 
 in a miserable dungeon, for the notable offense of preaching 
 the Gospel ! But, from that dim apartment, he sends forth 
 a book, whose original conception, grand and beautiful 
 imagery, touching pathos, purity of style and truthfulness 
 to nature arid experience, give its author an almost unrivaled 
 fame. And to-day the loftiest sons of genius hunt out the 
 grave of John Bunyan, the converted tinker, the author of 
 the " Pilgrim's Progress," and as they stand over the sweet 
 dreamer's ashes, they sigh for the inspiration which gave 
 enchantment to his pen. But what was the agent that called 
 the hidden powers of Bunyan's intellect into action, and 
 directed them to such a brilliant end ? But for the Christian 
 Religion, which awakened and developed all the good there 
 was ever in him, instead of being a star of surpassing 
 beauty, shedding the purest rays of light upon the human 
 intellect, he Avould have lived a loathsome human reptile, 
 crawling in the dust, and spitting the venom of death upon 
 mankind. He would have died "silent, unseen, unlamented."

 Whatever we may teach in our school rooms, or whatever 
 we may fail to teach; whatever may be our opinions, or 
 our prejudices in regard to true manhood, this fact is in- 
 disputable : In a life of manly piety, there is a power cal- 
 culated to elevate the standard of our manhood, to a degree 
 that can not be reached by all other agencies combined. 
 
 But what is the relation of the successful teacher, to this 
 manhood as exhibited in the after lives of his pupils? 
 Much as I should like to dwell on this thought, I shall 
 only briefly illustrate it. 
 
 Behold a splendid scene enacted at the close of the Rev- 
 olutionary War. Cornwallis and his army had surren- 
 dered, and the people w r ere returning thanks to God for 
 their deliverance. Washington accompanied by LaFayette 
 and other officers, pays a visit to his mother at Fredricks- 
 burg, Virginia. For six years the mother has not seen her 
 son, and now he comes loaded with honors — the nation's 
 idol. The citizens of the place give a grand ball in honor 
 of their illustrious visitors. The spacious saloon is bril- 
 liantly lighted, and is soon filled with the gay and the gal- 
 lant. There were those chivalrous Frenchmen in their gor- 
 geous uniforms, and those sturdy continentals, whose daring 
 courage and unconquerable spirit had triumphed over the 
 disciplined bravery of their English opponents. There, too, 
 w r ere the mothers of that heroic age, with their blushing 
 daughters, all radiant with the sunny spirit of joy that 
 reigned throughout that brilliant and patriotic assembly. 
 
 Presently the doors open to admit a personage whose en- 
 trance awakens universal attention. His presence kindles 
 every eye and heart with the ardor of rapturous enthusi- 
 asm. His figure is tall and commanding, and he treads the 
 floor with unsurpassed dignity, yet without haughtiness.

 He presents to their gaze the rare sight of a Christian sol- 
 dier and an unambitious statesman. He combines in his 
 character all the excellent qualities which make him the 
 embodiment of all that is good and great in manhood. He 
 is the man whose military prowess, and overawing influ- 
 ence, had sustained the spirit of the Revolution in its dark- 
 est hour, had crowned it with success, and earned forhim- 
 self the glorious pre-eminence of being " first in war, first 
 in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen." 
 Never was homage more sincerely rendered to any man 
 than to Washington, on this occasion, and never was it 
 more richly deserved. Nor is it possible to imagine a 
 greater, grander earthly joy, than that which must have 
 pervaded his bosom. 
 
 But there was another heart that shared in the joy of that 
 occasion. Leaning on the arm of the hero, in simple state- 
 liness of mien, walked Mary, the mother of Washington. 
 She had trained him in his boyhood. She had taught him 
 the lessons w T hich constituted the foundation of his success. 
 She had repressed the growth of evil qualities in his mind 
 and heart, and cultivated that divine life in his soul, which 
 led him to take counsel of the God of battles — the great 
 Governor of nations. And her early influence over her 
 illustrious son, was well understood, and silently acknowl- 
 edged even by that gay assembly. Yea, her son had owned 
 it — was proud of it. He laid his loftiest honors at her feet, 
 and prized her smile above the noisy voices of fame.^ The 
 joy of Washington must have been great, but the joy of his 
 mother, Avas, at least, equal. And it is her joy, her honor, 
 and her happiness, that are, at least in part, the legitimate 
 heritage of the faithful, earnest teacher, who takes the place 
 of many parents, and awakens and develops a true manhood

 in his pupils. May an understanding of this relation, help 
 us to prepare anew, for a more faithful discharge of the 
 really great duties of the teacher. 
 
 In conclusion, allow me to call your attention to an inci- 
 dent which furnishes us with probably the grandest exhibi- 
 tion of heroic manhood, on record. I do not again refer to 
 a soldier, and I may here remark, that it is not necessary to 
 be a soldier, in order to be a hero. I refer to John 
 Maynasd, who was the helmsman of the Ocean Queen, 
 and a man of unquestionable piety. The Ocean Queen 
 sailed on the Great Lakes; and when on Lake Erie one 
 day, she accidentally caught fire. The fire was not discov- 
 ered until too late to quench the flames, and the only hope 
 of saving the crew, was to run the steamer to the shore. 
 Hence, everything depended on the faithfulness of the 
 helmsman. The event, which resulted in the death of 
 Maynard, is well described in the following lines: 
 
 " 'Twas on Lake Erie's broad expanse, 
 
 One bright midsummer day, 
 The gallant steamer Ocean Queen, 
 
 Swept proudly on her way. 
 Bright faces clustered on the deck, 
 
 Or leaning o'er the side, 
 Watched carelessly the feathery foam, 
 
 That flecked. the rippling tide. 
 
 Ah, who beneath that cloudless sky, 
 
 That smiling bends serene, 
 Could dream that danger, awful, vast, 
 
 Impended o'er the scene — 
 Could dream that ere an hour had sped, 
 
 That frame of sturdy oak

 Would sink beneath the lake's blue waves, 
 Blackened with fire and smoke? 
 
 A seaman sought the captain's side, 
 
 A moment whispered low; 
 The captain's swarthy face grew pale, 
 
 He hurried down below. 
 Alas, too late! Though quick and sharp 
 
 And clear his orders came, 
 No human efforts could avail 
 
 To quench th' insidious flame. 
 
 The bad news quickly reached the deck, 
 
 It sped from lip to lip, 
 And ghastly faces everywhere 
 Looked from the doomed ship. 
 1 Is there no hope — no chance of life ? ' 
 
 A hundred lips implore; 
 ( But one/ the captain made reply, 
 i To run the ship on shore.' 
 
 A sailor, whose heroic soul 
 
 That hour should yet reveal, — 
 By name John Maynard, eastern born, — 
 Stood calmly at the wheel. 
 ' Head her south-east ! ' the captain shouts, 
 
 Above the smothered roar, 
 ' Head her south-east without delay ! 
 Make for the nearest shore ! ' 
 
 No terror pales the helmsman's cheek, 
 Or clouds his dauntless eye, 
 
 As in a sailor's measured tone 
 His voice responds, 6 Ay, Ay ! '

 Three hundred souls, — the steamer's freight, — 
 
 Crowd forward wild with fear, 
 While at the stern the dreadful flames 
 
 Above the deck appear. 
 
 But half a mile, but half a mile, — 
 
 A hundred hands stretch eagerly to shore, — 
 But half a mile, that distance sped 
 
 Peril shall all be o'er. 
 ' John Maynard, can you still hold out ? ' 
 
 He heard the captain cry, 
 A voice from out the stifling smoke, 
 
 Faintly responds, ' Ay ! Ay ! ' 
 
 John Maynard watched the nearing flames, 
 
 But still, with steady hand 
 He grasped the wheel, and steadfastly 
 He steered the ship to land. 
 ( John Maynard/ with an anxious voice, 
 
 The captain cries once more, 
 i Stand by the w r heel five minutes yet, 
 And we will reach the shore/ 
 Through flames and smoke that dauntless heart 
 
 Responded firmly still ; 
 Unawed, though face to face with death, 
 'With God's help I will!' 
 
 The flames approach with giant strides, 
 
 They scorch his hands and brow; 
 One arm disabled seeks his side, 
 
 ' Ah, he is conquered now ! ' 
 But no, his teeth are firmly set, 
 
 He crushes down the pain, —

 He guides the ship again. 
 
 One moment yet ! one moment yet ! 
 
 Brave heart, thy task is o'er ! 
 The pebbles grate beneath the keel, 
 
 The steamer touches shore. 
 Three hundred grateful voices rise, 
 
 In praise to God, that He 
 Hath saved them from the fearful fire, 
 
 And from th ? ingulfing sea. 
 
 But where is he, that helmsman bold? 
 
 The captain saw him reel — 
 His nerveless hands released their task, 
 
 He sank beside the wheel. 
 The wave received his lifeless corpse, 
 
 Blackened with smoke and fire. 
 God rest him ! Never a hero had 
 
 A nobler funeral pyre ! " — W. H. Fertich.
