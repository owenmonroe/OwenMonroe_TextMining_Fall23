ANNEX LIB.
ISBISTER'S · Lessons on Elocution.
a book in which there is a good deal of freshness and
method, even when the author is teaching very much what
jers on elocution have taught before him, while here and there
breaks out into actual originality; but whether it is original
er it is familiar instruction inspired anew, it is clear always
sé author is thinking of the necessary results and how to reach
them, and not very much of rules and principles which have been laid
down by masters who have gone before him.
• Mr. ISBISTER begins with an analysis of the sounds and articula-
tions of our language, and an inquiry into the manner in which they
are represented by letters and syllables. Some pages are devoted
to an explanation of the operations of the organs of speech by which
each particular sound and articulation is produced, and in this way,
while the pupil is learning useful facts in what may be called the
physiology of speech, he is going through a course of exercise in enunci-
ation, and learns to discriminate and to make distinctions, many of
which probably he never before gave a thought to. In a book of so
little bulk not very much room can be given to enunciation, but there
is enough if teacher and pupil will dwell upon and make practice of
the instruction given. More space is naturally devoted to expression.
In one of his earliest paragraphs on expression Mr. ISBISTER mentions
an essential element in good reading which, we think, has generally
escaped the attention of writers on the subject (the habit of keeping
the eye in advance of what is being read].
There can be no doubt that a good reader must be able to read by
sight much faster than he can read by speech, and the student will do
well to train himself in rapid reading by the eye, so that he may give
expression to each word by the light of a knowledge of what is coming.
Mr. ISBISTER is, we think, the first to attempt to turn to account
the modern work of the grammatical analysis of sentences in elocution,
Analysis, according to our author, is the true guide to the logical
pause in reading, there being no other sufficient guide. ...
Introducing, therefore, his exercise on the pause by analysis, in a
long passage from the “Deserted Village,” he says of what he calls the
“logical pause":-
“It has for its object the separation of the sentence into its logical elements, and
indicates the breaks or pauses of the sense formed at each recurring group of words
made up of the subject predicate and object, and their extensions. As already
explained, these must be considered as forming so many oratorical words, indivisible
in meaning, however made up of grammatical parts.”
* Nearly half the book is occupied with the instructions and technical
exercises ; the remainder consists of well-chosen selections for training
and practice, nearly all the pieces being articulated and annotated.
For example, we have a short extract of about five and twenty lines
from “Paradise Lost,” commencing “Whence, and what art thou,
execrable shape ?" and the lines are dotted down with little figures,
these figures standing also at the head of the extract with these indica-
tions of the expr
s marked : “1, angry
questioning ; 2,
disdainful defiance;

tion in general,

PREFACE.
The present little work takes up a middle ground between
the numerous Speakers' aiming more specifically to teach
Declamation or Oratory, and the still more numerous class of
‘Readers,' or 'Collections' where the object is mainly, if not
entirely, by means of extracts selected from various authors,
to convey information or entertainment to the reader. It
aims primarily to teach the art of easy, correct, and tasteful
reading, as an accomplishment and a necessary part of a good
education, and in connection with this, and as an essential
preliminary to excellence in it, to impart the habit of a
close study of what is read, with a view to a thorough un-
derstanding of the meaning. With these objects, the pupil
is conducted, first, through a series of Exercises in “Arti-
culation,' showing the powers of the letters, the mechanism
by which the various sounds are produced, the effect of accent,
syllabication, &c., illustrated by numerous examples, which,
while they will afford ample practice in mastering the most
difficult combinations, are well calculated to awaken the at-
tention and excite the interest even of very young children.
From Articulation, the learner is led by easy gradations to
'Expression,' where the effects of emphasis, inflection, and
pauses, in modifying the force and application of words, are
illustrated by appropriate Exercises. To promote the habit
of a close study of the meaning, an analysis is given of an
extract from the 'Deserted Village' of Goldsmith, setting out
in detail the principal and subordinate sentences of which it
consists, from which it will be seen how much all real grace
and propriety of utterance depend on a perception of the
logical relations of the successive sentences and their several
parts. Extracts are also given, with marginal references

and annotations intended to draw the attention of the pupil
to the alternations of thought and feeling in the passages
selected, so as to serve as a guide to their proper expression
in reading and delivery. The habit of a critical analysis of
what is read being once formed, such aids may, as the pupil
advances, be dispensed with, and they are accordingly by
degrees discontinued. When this end has been attained,
nature and habit will suggest the proper delivery, and rules
and directions for the purpose become unnecessary. *
An additional reason which has influenced the compiler in
the publication of this little volume has been the desire to
furnish a Selection of Extracts, which, while they supply
some of the most exquisite specimens of the literature of
our native land, in almost every variety of style, are suitable
for repetition by pupils of both sexes in schools. The good
old practice of learning by heart' is, under the pressure of
the numerous subjects which now demand attention in
education, in some danger of losing its hold on schools.
There can be no better means, however, for developing the
taste and storing the memory with a choice vocabulary, than
the practice of recitation, which, while it softens and refines
the feelings, raises, by the study of the masterpieces of our
literature, the general tone of the mind and of our thoughts,
makes us familiar with the beauties of our language, and
brings us into direct converse with some of the best and
greatest men of all times. The teacher who has not given
this important subject the attention it deserves, will do weli
to read the following extract from a lecture by Mr. Vernon
Lushington, which will be found well deserving of perusal.
On Learning by Heart.
Till he has fairly tried it, I suspect a reader does not know how
much he would gain from committing to memory passages of real
excellence; precisely because he does not know how much he over-
looks in merely reading. Learn one true poem by heart, and see if
you do not find it so. Beauty after beauty will reveal itself, in
chosen phrase, or happy music, or noble suggestion, otherwise un-
dreamed of. It is like looking at one of Nature's wonders through

larger sense of ORATORY, is taken up in the more advanced work, The Illustrated

PREFACE.
a microscope. Again : how much in such a poem that you really
did feel admirable and lovely on a first reading, passes away, if you
do not give it a further and much better reading !-passes away
utterly, like a sweet sound, or an image on the lake, which the first
breath of wind dispels. If you could only fix that image, as the
photographers do theirs, so beautifully, so perfectly! And you can
do so! Learn it by heart, and it is yours for ever!
I have said, a true poem; for naturally men will choose to learn
poetry—from the beginning of time they have done so. To immortal
verse the memory gives a willing, a joyous, and a lasting home. How.
ever, somne prose is poetical, is poetry, and altogether worthy to be
learned by heart; and the learning is not so very difficult. It is
not difficult or toilsome to learn that which pleases us; and the
labour, once given, is forgotten, while the result remains.
Poems and noble extracts, whether of verse or prose, once so
reduced into possession and rendered truly our own, may be to us
a daily pleasure ;-better far than a whole library unused. They
may come to us in our dull moments, to refresh us as with spring
flowers ; in our selfish musings, to win us by pure delight from the
tyranny of foolish castle-building, self-congratulations, and mean
anxieties. They may be with us in the work-shop, in the crowded
streets, by the fireside; sometimes, perhaps, on pleasant hill-sides,
or by sounding shores;-noble friends and companions—our own!
never intrusive, ever at hand, coming at our call !
Shakspeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Tennyson,—the words of such
men do not stale upon us, they do not grow old or cold. . . . Further:
though you are young now, some day you will be old. Some day
you may reach that time when a man lives in greater part for
memory and by memory. I can imagine a chance renewal, chance
visitation of the words long remembered, long garnered in the heart,
and I think I see a gleam of rare joy in the eyes of the old man.
For those, in particular, whose leisure time is short, and precious
as scant rations to beleaguered men, I believe there could not be a
better expenditure of time than deliberately giving an occasional
hour-it requires no more to committing to memory chosen pas-
sages from great authors. If the mind were thus daily nourished
with a few choice words of the best English poets and writers ; if
the habit of learning by heart were to become so general, that, as a
matter of course, any person presuming to be educated amongst us
might be expected to be equipped with a few good pieces,- I believe
it would lead, far more than the mere sound of it suggests, to the
diffusion of the best kind of literature, and the right appreciation of
it, and men would not long rest satisfied with knowing a few stock
pieces. ....

PREFACE.
The only objection I can conceive to what I have been saying is,
that it may be said that a relish for higher literature belongs only
to the few; that it is the result of cultivation ; and that there is no
use in trying to create what must be in general only a fictitious
interest. But I do not admit that literature, even the higher litera-
ture, must belong to the few. Poetry is, in the main, essentially
catholic-addressed to all men; and though some poetry requires
particular knowledge and superior culture, much, and that the
noblest, needs only natural feeling and the light of common expe-
rience. Such poetry, taken in moderation, followed with genuine
good-will, shared in common, will be intelligible and delightful to
most men who will take the trouble to be students at all, and ever
more and more so.
Perhaps, also, there may be a fragment of truth in what Charles
Lamb has said,—that any spouting withers and blows upon a fine
passage;' that there is no enjoying it after it has been 'pawed about
by declamatory boys and men. But surely there is a reasonable
habit of recitation as well as an unreasonable one; there is no need
of declamatory pawing. To abandon all recitation, is to give up
a custom which has given delight and instruction to all the races of
articulately speaking men. If our faces are set against vain display,
and set towards rational enjoyment of one another, each freely giving
his best, and freely receiving what his neighbour offers, we need not
fear that our social evenings will be marred by an occasional recita-
tion, or that the fine passages will wither. And, moreover, it is not
for reciting's sake that I chiefly recommend this most faithful form
of reading-learning by heart.
I come back, therefore, to this, that learning by heart is a good
thing, and is neglected amongst us. Why is it neglected ? Partly
because of our indolence, but partly, I take it, because we do not
sufficiently consider that it is a good thing, and needs to be taken in
hand. We need to be reminded of it: I here remind you. Like a
town-crier, ringing my bell, I would say to you, Oyez, oyez! Lost,
stolen, or strayed, a good ancient practice-the good arcient prac-
tice of learring by heart. Every finder should be handsomely
rewarded,' . ...
If any ask, “What shall I learn ?' the answer is, Do as you do
with tunes – begin with what you sincerely like best, what you would
most wish to remember, what you would most enjoy saying to your-
self or repeating to another. You will soon find the list inex-
haustible. Then keeping up' is easy. Everyone has spare ten
minutes; one of the problems of life is how to employ them use-
fully. You may well spend some in looking after and securing this
good property you have won.

INTRODUCTION.
PART I. ELOCUTION.
1. Elocution is the art of delivering written or spoken lan
guage in the way best calculated to express the sense, beauty,
or force of the words employed by the speaker.
2. The requisites of a good delivery are :-
1. The clear Enunciation of separate words and their ele-
ments.
2. The just Expression of the sense of words in connected
discourse.
3. Appropriate Gesture, comprehending under this head the
attitude, motions, and aspect of countenance most suitable to lend
animation and force to speech.
ENUNCIATION.
3. Enunciation is the distinct utterance of words in read-
ing and speaking.
4. Enunciation depends for its distinctness on due atten-
tion to
1. Articulation.
2. Syllabication.
3. Accent.
ARTICULATION
5. A good articulation consists in giving every letter and
syllable of a word its due proportion of sound and distinct-
n988.
6. In a perfect alphabet every sound would have its own letter,
and every letter its own sound. But ours is not a perfect alpha-
bet; for while there are forty-two simple sounds in the language,

there are but twenty-six letters by which they can be expressed.
These sounds and the expedients adopted for representing them are
exhibited in the following table, where they are indicated by the
italic letters.

ALPHABETIC EQUIVALENTS.
7. Tried by the test of the foregoing table, the English
alphabet is both defective and redundant. There are simple
sounds in the language for which there are no separate
letters, and there are letters which represent several distinct
sounds. Nor do the irregularities of our alphabet end here;
for, as is shown in the subjoined lists, these sounds can in
their turn be represented by a variety of other letters and
combinations which are equivalent to them. A careful study
of these equivalents is necessary to a complete view of the
elementary sounds of the language.

CONSONANT SOUNDS.
8. To ensure a clear and distinct articulation it is neces-
sary, while giving to each vowel its proper sound, to take es-
pecial care to give full effect to the consonants, simple and
compound, and more particularly those with which words
begin and terminate. It is the consonant sounds which are
mainly subservient to articulation; and hence the pupil
should be well exercised in the repetition of such sounds,
particularly those which he finds difficult to his organs. The
following exercises, arranged with reference to the organs of
speech, by which the requisite sounds are in each case pro-
duced, will be found well suited for this purpose. The let-
ters requiring particular attention are printed in italics.
9. The sound of the consonants is modified by the position of
the tongue, palate, lips, and teeth, and by the degree in which the
air is permitted to pass between them or through the nose in
the act of articulation.* Hence the terms, lingual (Lat. lingua,
* An articulate sound, in its literal meaning, is a sound proceeding from the
articulation or jointing of the organs (Lat. articulus, a joint), and articulation is
thus the art of closing or joining the organs in the production of speech

The column headed 'voiceless, includes the consonants which
are produced by the breath alone without voice; and that headed
• voice' those to which voice is superadded. The distinction,
which will be readily observed in attempting to pronounce the
sounds represented by the corresponding pairs of consonants, p-b,
t-d, f-v, k-g, is one of some importance in Elocution. The voice
consonants partake much of the nature of vowels; and it is a
pleasure to a good reader,' says Mr. Smart, 'when he has such
sounds to utter. He dwells upon them, throws into them all the
voice they are capable of receiving, and, through their means,
mellows his whole pronunciation. But to an uncultivated reader
all sounds come alike indifferent. He clutters them together,
curtails them of their due length, deprives them of the share of
voice which belongs to them, and thereby reduces them all to
mutes or aspirates.'

Vowel Sounds.
10. The vowel sounds, for the purposes of reading, may
, be divided into two classes, the accented or long vowels,
and the unaccented or short vowels. While the proper pro-
nunciation of the consonant sounds, is essential to distinct
articulation, it is of primary importance that attention be
paid also to the vowel sounds, as the proper use of these fur-
nishes one of the most effectual safeguards against every form
of provincialism. One of the most striking defects in the
reading and speaking of ill-educated persons is a vulgar pro-
nunciation of the vowels, more especially those not under
accent. Thus we hear possible, singular, regular, particular,
sounded as if written possuble, singlar, reglar, particlar.
In the following exercises a full and prolonged sound is to
be given to the long vowels marked by an accent, while a
shorter but still distinct sound is to be given to the unac-
cented vowels, printed in italics, in the second extract.

Temperature depends upon the property all bodies possess, more or
less, of perpetually absorbing and emitting or radiating heat. When
the interchange is equal, the temperature of a substance remains the
same; but when the radiation exceeds the absorption it becomes
colder, and vice versa. The radiation is abundant when the sky is
still, clear and blue; but clouds intercept it, so that a thermometer
rises in cloudy weather and sinks when the air becomes clear and
calm ; even a slight mist diminishes radiation from the earth because
it returns as much heat as it receives. The temperature of the air is
subject to such irregularities from these circumstances, and from the
difference of the radiating powers of the bodies at the surface of the
globe, that it is necessary to find by experiment the mean or average
warmth of the day, month, and year at a great variety of places, in
order to have a standard by which the temperature in different
parallels of latitude may be compared.—Mrs. Somerville.
SYLLABICATION.
11. When the student has attained a complete command
over the articulation of the elementary sounds, he should
proceed to analyse the construction of syllables, more espe-
cially those combinations which do not readily unite in one
byllabic impulse. The chief difficulties in such combina-
tions arise from the presence of allied or reduplicated conso-
nants, or a hiatus of vowels, where the sounds are apt with
careless readers and speakers to run into each other, pro-
ducing an indistinctness of utterance, and not unfrequently
a confusion of the sense. The best rule in all such cases is,
to take care that the organs completely finish one articulation
before beginning to form another. Where a word or a sen-
tence ends, and the next begins with the same or an allied
consonant, a difficulty of utterance arises that should be ob-
viated by dwelling on the final consonant, and then taking
up the one at the beginning of the next word in a second
impulse of the voice with a short pause between.

ACCENT.
12. While exercises like the foregoing cannot fail to prove
useful in acquiring a clear and firm articulation, care must
be taken to avoid the fault of a measured and pedantic man-
ner of speaking and reading, which an exaggerated distinct-
ness of pronunciation is apt to produce. The best corrective
to this is a proper use of accent, which is that stress of the
voice by which one syllable of a word is made more promi-
nent than others, and by which the necessary variety and
animation are imparted to speech. Accent being a matter of
usage, for which there is no rule but the language of good
society and the practice of the best speakers, the student's
only sure guide is reference to a dictionary—a laborious pro-
cess, but which will yield results in time. We can only here
notice, among other illustrations of the importance of accent,
a few of that large class of words, which, though composed of
the same letters, assume with a change of accentuation a dif.
ferent meaning.

-EXPRESSION.
13. After the student has acquired distinctness of arti.
culation and the correct pronunciation of single words, he
may proceed to the next stage in the study of Elocution-
Expression, which deals with groups of words, and the sense
expressed by them when they are combined in sentences.
In this process he has not, as before, merely to give each word
its full sound; he must mould the pronunciation of each
according to the meaning it is designed to convey, and in
accordance with certain laws of speech by which, in a col-
location of sounds the object of which is to produce a definite
impression on the mind, some must be subordinated to others,
and some modified só as to harmonise with those which
precede or follow. Expression depends for its effectiveness
on attention to
1. Inflection.
3. Emphasis.
2. Modulation.
4. Pause.
14. The basis of Expression is a right understanding of the
meaning, and the best key to this meaning is a familiarity with
the principles of construction developed by the logical analysis of
the sentence. The simplest form of the sentence is that where it
is formed of a single subject and a single predicate, e.g., boys-
read;' and here the most uncultivated reader can hardly fail to
give each word its proper expression. When this sentence be-
comes enlarged by the addition of an object or other accessories,
e. 8The
The-boys-of-this-class ... will-read ... a-lesson-in-history,'
the members of the sentence, though consisting of several gram-
matical parts, are in meaning indivisible, and in delivery may be
regarded as one word of many syllables, subject to the same
general laws of expression as when the members consisted of
single words. The student who keeps this principle before him,
will always be in the right track for reading even the most com-
plicated passages with an intelligent appreciation of the sense to
be conveyed. Practice will lead him to the habit of keeping the
eye so far in advance of the lips, as to enable him to grasp the pur-
port of a sentence, and rapidly analyse it before he has actually
begun to read it, an accomplishment without which he can
never become an effective reader, and which will be found not so
difficult in practice as it may appear in description.
INFLECTION.
15. Inflection is the name applied to the slides which the
voice makes in going from one note to another in reading or
speaking.


## p. 10 (#22) ##############################################

ELOCUTION.
16. All notes of the voice are either Continuative, Acute,
or Grave, or a combination of these.
When the tone is continuative, it is called a Monotone.*
When it slides upwards, the Rising Inflection.
When it slides downwards, the Falling Inflection.
When the slides are united, the Circumflex Inflection
17. Inflection may be illustrated by a reference to the distinc-
tion between musical and speaking sounds. Musical sounds con.
tinue for a given time on one point or pitch of the musical scale,
and leap as it were from one note to another as in striking the
keys of the pianoforte. The sounds produced in speaking,
instead of dwelling on the note they begin with, slide either up-
wards or downwards, as in the mewing sound produced in playing
the violin when the finger is made to slide up and down the
string while the bow is drawn across it. It is to these waves or
bendings of the voice that the name Inflection (Lat. inflecto, I
bend) is applied. The rise and fall of the sounds produced by
inflection, their swelling or sinking according to the requirements.
of the sense, constitute one of the greatest charms of good
reading.
Monotone or Subdued Inflection,
18. The Monotone is well suited for the delivery of pas-
sages of a solemn or elevated character, which raise emotions
of sublimity, awe, reverence or terror.
Ex. 13.
Examples of Monotone.
And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was on
the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved on the face of
the waters.
Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble.
He cometh up like a flower, and is cut down : he fleeth also as a
shadow, and continueth not.
High on a throne of royal state, which far
Outshone the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind,
Or where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,
Satan exalted sat.
A monotone in the strict sense cannot be properly included under the head
of Inflection, which from its very definition implies a constant change of voice.
But there is in reality no such thing as an unvaried repetition of the same tona
in speaking. What is called a monotone is-to employ Mr. Bell's definition-
. an emphatic prolongation of the continuative tone in which the inflections
are subdued as much as possible. It is in this approximative sense only of
subdued inflections that monotones are employed in elocution.

Aow reverend is the face of this tall pile,
Whose ancient pillars rear their marbled heads,
To bear aloft its arched and ponderous roof,
By its own weight made steadfast and immovable,
Looking tranquillity! It strikes an awe
And terror on my aching sight; the tombs
And monumental caves of death look cold,
And shoot a chillness to my trembling heart.
Methought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more !
Macbeth doth murder sleep--the innocent sleep
Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care-
The death of each day's life-sore labour's bath-
Balm of hurt minds—great Nature's second course
Chief nourisher in life's feast.
Still it cried, 'Sleep no more !' to all the house :
.Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more!'
Table of Inflections,
19. Of Inflections, properly so called, there are, as already
stated, three kinds. As a general rule, the rising inflection
is used at that part of a sentence where the sense is incom-
plete, and the falling inflection where the sense is completed.
The circumflex or compound inflection both ascends and
descends in what may be described as a wave of the voice,
and is generally used in vehement interrogation, or in the
expression of contempt, irony, sarcasm, derision, contrast,
or reproach. The Exercises which follow afford examples of
each of these kinds of inflection.
Anyone who understands the distinction between the principal
and the secondary clauses of a sentence, will readily recognise the
situations where a rising or a falling inflection should take place.
For the assistance of the reader the rising inflection is indicated
in the following Exercises by the acute accent (); the falling by
the grave (); and the compound by the circumflex accent (^3
when it commences with a rising and ends with a falling slide of
the voice, and by the circumflex reversed (w) when it commences
with a falling and ends with a rising slide.

20. Writers on Elocution lay down a variety of rules to guide
the pupil in the use of inflections, but it may be doubted whether
they are of much practical value. Besides the fact that all voices
are not of the same compass, and cannot be inflected with the
same ease, variety, or effect, such rules can only in a very few
cases be regarded as absolute. Individual taste and judgment,
based on a thorough understanding of the subject-matter, must
decide in general when the voice must rise and fall. Some of the
leading canons given in works on Elocution may be noticed.
Use the Rising Inflection. 1. Between the subject and predicate. 2
Between the principal subordinate clauses of a complex sentence. 3.
Between the parts of a compound sentence signifying concession, com-
parison, or contrast. 4. After exclamations of surprise in the echo of
words. 5. After questions introduced by verbs.
Use the Falling Inflection. 1. At the end of a sentence. 2. At the end of
clauses completing the sense. 3. After exclamations of solemnity, awe, or
strong admiration. 4. After questions introduced by pronouns and
adverbs.
MODULATION.
21. The key or scale of the inflections may frequently be
varied to express more forcibly the emotions inspired by the
subject. Sometimes the feeling embodied in the passage to
be read or spoken may be most appropriately expressed by
pitching the voice in a high key, at other times in a low key.
The changes or shifts of the voice in passing from one key to
another constitute the special subject of Modulation, which
teaches the proper adaptation of the tones of the voice to the
character of the matter to be delivered. Every change of
modulation is usually accompanied by changes of Tone and
Time.
The change of voice is sometimes made to a proximate key; at
other times a bold and abrupt transition to a remote key is


## p. 13 (#25) ##############################################

EXPRESSION.
13
necessary to produce the desired effect. These abrupt transitions
constitute the distinction between Modulation and Inflection, which
proceeds in a continuous and unbroken movement from one note
of the vocal scale to another.*
Tone.
22. Every person in reading and speaking assumes a
certain pitch or key, which may be either high or low, accord-
ing to the nature of the subject, and which exercises a
governing influence on the variations of the voice above and
below it. The voice has been considered capable of assuming
three such keys—the low, the high, and the middle. From
these the inflections may proceed upwards or downwards,
ranging through the various degrees of intonation necessary
to express the different shades of passion and emotion.
A distinction should be observed between the terms high and
low, and loud and soft, which are often but erroneously regarded
as synonymous. The latter, like the forte and piano in music to
which they precisely correspond, denote merely the degree of force
or volume of sound it may be deemed necessary to use in the same
key, while the former intimate a change of key altogether. A
sound may be high and soft, as well as high and loud. Pitch is
thus independent of force, though force adds frequently much to
the effect of pitch.
Low Tone.
23. The Low Tone falls below the usual speaking key, and
is employed in expressing emotions of fear, caution, secresy,
solemnity, and tender emotions generally.
El. 15.
O coward conscience, how dost thou affright me!
The light burns blue. It is now dead midnight;
Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
Tread softly, bow the head-
In reverent silence bow,
No passing bell doth toll,
Yet an immortal soul
Is passing now.
Speak low,' he cries, and gives his little band :
• Mamma's asleep upon the dew cold sand :
Alas! we both with cold and hunger quake:
Why do you weep? Mamma will soon awake.'
* In the language of music, from which the term has been borrowed, modula-
tion means the change of the key or mode in conducting the melody and in a
narrower sense the transition from one key to another.

Middle Tone.
24. This is the tone of common discourse, and is used in
ordinary conversation, narrative, reflection, &c.
Ex. 16.
I have seen
A curions child who dwelt upon a tract
Of inland ground, applying to his ear
The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell;
To which in silence hushed, his very soul
Listened intently; and his countenance soon
Brightened with joy; for murmurings from within
Were heard—sonorous cadences; whereby,
To his belief, the monitor expressed
Mysterious union with its native sea.
Even such a shell the universe itself
Is to the ear of Faith ; and there are times,
I doubt not, when to you it doth impart
Authentic tidings of invisible things;
Of ebb and flow, and ever-during power,
And central peace subsisting at the heart
Of endless agitation.
High Tone.
25. The High Tone is that which rises above the usual
speaking key, and is used in expressing elevated and joyous
feelings and strong emotions.
Ex. 17.
Fight, gentlemen of England ! fight, bold yeomen!
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head;
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom;
Advance our standards! set upon our foes !
Our ancient word of courage, fair St. George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons !
Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.
Strike-till the last armed foe expires ;
Strike--for your altars and your fires;
Strike—for the green graves of your sires,
God—and your native land. .
Time.
26. Time is an important element in modulation, as much
of the sentiment and effect of a passage depends on the slow
or rapid utterance with which it is pronounced. Like Tone,

15
with which it is closely connected in Expression, it may be
considered under three heads; as Quick, Moderate, and Slow.
27. Between these limits there may of course be many varieties
in the rate or movemen: of words in speaking. Some writers on
Elocution have attarapted to apply a definite notation, borrowed
from the language of music, to the principal varieties, e. g.
Adagio, my slow. Staccato, successive, sharp, distinct tones.
Andante, middle degree. Sostenuto, successive tones blended.
Allegro, quick.
Ritardando, slackening the time.
Presto, very quick. Accelerando, quickening the time.
Quick Time.
28. Quick Kate is used to express joy, mirth, raillery, viam
lent anger, and excited states generally.
Ex. 18. Now strike the golden lyre again!
A louder yet, and yet a louder strain !
Break his bands of sleep asunder,
And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder!
Hark! hark !—the horrid sound
Has raised up his head
As awaked from the dead,
And, amazed, he stares around.
* Revenge! revenge!' Timotheus cries-
See the Furies arise,
See the snakes that they rear,
How they hiss in their hair,
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes !
Behold a ghastly band,
Each a torch in his hand;
These are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain.
And unburied remain
Inglorious on the plain!
Give the vengeance due
To the valiant crew.
Behold how they toss their torches on high,
How they point to the Persian abodes,
And glitt'ring temples of the hostile gods.
The princes applaud with a furious joy ;
And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;
Thaïs led the way
To light them to their prey,
And, like another Helen, fired another Troy.

ment, and unimpassioned speech,

EMPHASIS.
31. Emphasis is a special stress laid upon one or more
words of a sentence, in order to give them the prominence
and importance which the author intends. Emphasis gene-
rally may be divided into two kinds :
1. Emphasis of Sense.
2. Emphasis of Feeling.
32. Words may be rendered prominent or emphatic in several
ways, e.g. By an increased stress of the voice on the emphatic word ;
by varying the inflection, to denote antithesis, doubt, negation,
irony, &c.; by varying the time, by prolonging or abridging the
sound of the emphasised word; by altering the pitch, to express
any sudden emotion, or in descending from a higher to a lower
note, or vice versa; by the use of monotone, to give expression to
solemn or sublime passages; or by the pause, by which the emphatic
word is separated from those parts of the sentence which precede
or follow it. To determine the emphatic word of a sentence, as
well as the degree and kind of emphasis to be employed, the
reader must be governed wholly by the sentiment to be conveyed.
The idea is sometimes entertained that emphasis consists merely
in force or loudness of tone. But it should be borne in mind that
the most marked emphasis may often be expressed by a whisper.
Emphasis of Sense.
33. The Emphasis of Sense is a stress laid upon one or more
kords in a sentence to bring out its meaning more clearly.
34. The reader must be guided in the application of the Em-
phasis of Sense by the grammatical arrangement of the words of
the sentence, and by the relation which the whole sentence bears
to the context. The importance of Emphasis is such that, if it
be not laid in the proper place, the meaning of the sentence will
be completely altered. This will be obvious from the following
examples, which have been arranged in the form of question and
answer, and it will be seen that the answers vary in each cas
according to the position of the emphatic word.
Ex. 22.
Variation of the Sense by Emphasis.
Shall you ride to town to-day?
No; but I shall to-morrow.
Shall you ride to town to-day ?
No; I shall ride into the country.
Shall you ride tú town to-day?
No; I propose to walk.

ELOCUTION.
Shall you ride to town to-day ?
No; I shall send my servant.
Shall you ride to town to-day ?
Yes ; why did you think I would not ?
In all these Examples it will be seen that there is an opposition or anti-
thesis implied. When the question is asked, "Shall you ride to town
to-day?' the emphatic 'to-day' is in opposition or contrast to the state.
ment that I shall go to-morrow. Hence this kind of Emphasis is often
described as antithetic, in contrast to the absolute Emphasis of Feeling, which
distinguishes words without suggesting relation or contrast.
Emphasis of Feeling.
35. Emphasis of feeling is a stress laid upon words, nou
because the sense intended to be conveyed requires it, but
because it is prompted by the force of the speaker's own
feelings.
36. This species of Emphasis, used under strong emotion and in
vehement or impassioned discourse, is one of the chief instruments
of effective speaking. It is an expression of strong feeling in a
form that breaks through ordinary rules, and renders the most
insignificant particle important. As it distinguishes words with-
out any suggestion of contrast or relation, it is, as already stated,
sometimes called general or absolute Emphasis, in contradis-
tinction to antithetic Emphasis, where contrast is always implied.
It is not so much regulated by the sense of the author as by the
taste and feelings of the reader, and therefore does not admit
of any precise rules. Its use will be best illustrated by a few
Examples.
Ex. 23. Examples of the Emphasis of Feeling.
But see! the enemy retire.
Why will ye die? O house of Israel.
To-morrow, didst thou say? TO-MORROW ?
It is a period nowhere to be found
In all the hoary registers of time.
--What men could do
Is done already; heaven and earth will witness,
If Rome must fall, that we are innocent.
There was a time, my fellow citizens, when the Lacedemonians
were sovereign masters by sea and land; when their troops and
forts surrounded the entire circuit of Attica; when they possessed
Eubea, Tanagra, the whole Baotian district, Megara, Egina,
Cleone, and the other islands; while this state had not one ship,
no, not-one-wall.

EXPRESSION.
PAUSE.
37. Pauses are suspensions of the voice in reading and
speaking, used to mark various states of feeling, and to give
effect to expression. Like emphasis, with which it is closely
allied, it may be considered under two heads,—the Logical
Pause and the Pause of Feeling.
38. The Pause is one of the most effective elements in reading and
declamation, and its importance cannot be too strongly impressed
on the pupil. The ordinary marks of punctuation, though useful so
far as they go, are insufficient for the purposes, not only of ex-
pression, but of sense, even when they are (as they are not always)
correctly placed ; for as Mr. Walker justly observes, ‘Not half
the pauses are found in printing which are heard in the pronuncia-
tion of a good reader or speaker. The difficulty of laying down
absolute rules for the proper use of these pauses, is shown by the
arbitrary and perplexing directions on this subject given in most
of our current text-books on elocution. In the following Exercises
an attempt has been made to place the theory of pauses on its
only true basis, the relations developed by the logical analysis of
the sentence.
The Logical Pause,
39. This Pause has for its object the separation of the
sentence into its logical elements, and indicates the breaks
or pauses of the sense formed at each recurring group of
words made up of the subject predicate and object, and their
extensions. As already explained (§ 14), these must be con-
sidered as forming so many oratorical words, indivisible in
meaning, however made up of grammatical parts.
40. In the following extract from the Deserted Village' of
Goldsmith, the logical relations of the successive sentences and
their several parts, and the pauses founded on them, are indicated
to the eye by breaks in the proper places. Each sentence is sepa-
rated into its logical elements, and the distinction between prin-
cipal and subordinate clauses is indicated by a very simple
notation. Principal clauses are distinguished by capital letters,
and the clauses subordinate to them by a corresponding small
letter, the degree of subordination in each case being indicated by
the index figure attached to the letter, as shown in the following
scheme:
Principal Clauses A, B, C, D, E, &c.
Subordinate (1st remove a, 2a,, 3a,; b, 26, 36,, &c.

2nd remove ag, 2a2, 3a, ; 62, 26, 36, &c.

The perpendicular line denotes the Cæsural Pause.
* A full account of the Analysis of Sentences, with an explanation of the
aotation here employed, will be found in the writer's Elements of English
Grammar.'

Up yonder hill the village murmur rose; -
*There, - as I pass'd / with careless step and slow,-
'The mingled notes came soften'd from below;-
The swain responsivel - as the milk-maid sung, -
The sober herdſ - that low'd to meet their young;-

The watch-dog's voicel - that bay'd the whispering wind,-
And the loud laugh - that spoke the vacant mind :-

These all in sweet confusion sought the shade, -
And fill'd each pause - the nightingale had made.-
But now the sounds of population fail, -
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale, -
No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread, -

All but yon widow'd, solitary thing, -
That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;
She, wretched matron, forced, in age, for bread,
To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,
To pick her wintry fagot|from the thorn,
To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn;
She only left of all the harmless train,
The sad historian of the pensive plain. -
Near yonder copse, - where once the garden smiled, -
And still where many a garden-flower grows wild, -
There, - where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,-
The village preacher's modest mansion rose. -
A man he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich/with forty pounds a year; -
Remote from towns he ran his godly race, -
Nor e'er had changed, | - nor wish'd to change, his place;-
Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power
By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;-
For other aims his heart|had learned to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched than to rise. -
His house was known to all the vagrant train, -
He chid their wanderings, | - but relieved their pain ;-
The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,-
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ;-

Pause of Feeling.
41. As in the corresponding part of Emphasis, no precise
rules can be laid down for the use of the ‘Pause of Feeling,'
the right application of which must depend on the nature of
the subject, and the taste and judgment of the reader. The
following Exercise is given rather with the view of showing
how the learner under the direction of his teacher may mark
such passages for himself than as an absolute standard of cor-
rectness. The varieties of type are an attempt to denote to
the eye the degree of stress to be given to each emphatic word.
No exact time can be fixed for the length of the pause, which

ought to be made long or short according to the nature and
sentiment of the passage which is being read. The voice
should have a tone of continuance throughout, which consti-
tutes the difference between a pause and a break.
Ex. 25.
HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY.
Marked for the Pause and Emphasis of Feeling.
TO BE - or not to be - that is the question; -
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune -
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And - by opposing - end them ? - To DIE ? - TO SLEEP -
No more - and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to - 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. TO DIE - to SLEEP •
TO SLEEP! - Perchance to - DREAM! - Ay, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of DEATH what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil -
Must give us pause. THERE's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time -
The oppressor's wrong - the proud man's contumely ·
The pangs of despis'd love - the law's delay -
The insolence of office - and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes -
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare boš kin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life -
But that the dread of SOMETHING after death -
The undiscovered country - from whose bourn
No traveller returns - puzzles the will -
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus CONSCIENCE does make COWARDS of us all -
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn away
And lose the name of ACTION.

saw them now about him. There was no grey mist before them -
as there had been sometimes in the night. He knew them EVERY-
ONE and called them by their names. And who is THJS? Is this
my old nurse?'. asked the child - regarding with a radiant smile
& figure coming in. Yes - YES. No other stranger would have
shed those tears at sight of him - called him her DEAR boy - her
PRETTY boy - her own · poor - BLIGHTED child. No other woman
would have stooped down by his bed - and taken up his wasted
hand - and put it to her lips and breast - as one who had some
right to fondle it. No other woman would have so forgotten every-
body there - but him and Floy - and been so full of TENDERNESS
and PITY.
*Floy! this is a kind - good face - I am glad to see it again.
Don't go away - old nurse - Stay here - Good-bye!'
GOOD-BYE - my child' - cried Mrs. Pipchin - hurrying to the
bed's head - Not good-bye!'
*Ah, yes - good - bye! Where's papa ?'
He FELT his father's breath upon his cheek before the words had
parted from his lips. The feeble hand - waved - in the air - as if
it cried - 'good-bye' again.
Now lay me down - and - Floy - come close to me - and let me -

SISTER and BROTHER wound their arms around each other - and
the golden light came streaming in - and fell upon them - locked
together.
How fast the river runs - between its green bank and the
rushes - Floy! But its very near the sea - I hear the WAVES !
They always said so!'.
Presently he told her that the motion of the boat upon the
stream was lulling him to REST - how green the banks were now-
how bright the flowers growing on them - how tall the rushes !
Now - The boat was out at sea - but gliding smoothly on. And
NOW - there was a shore before him.
Who stood on the BANK ?
He put his hands TOGETHER - as he had been used to do, at his
PRAYERS. He did not remove his arms to do it - but they saw him
fold them so - behind his sister's NECK.
• Mama is like you - Floy - I know her by the face. But - tell
them that - the picture - on the stairs - at school - is not DIVINE

· PART II.
EXERCISES IN READING,
ILLUSTRATING THE FOREGOING RULES AND PRINCIPLES.
42. The principal points in connection with Enunciation and Ex-
pression, to which the attention of the learner should be directed,
have now been touched upon briefly, but it is hoped with sufficient
fulness for all practical purposes, in the foregoing pages. But to
secure good reading, which is the foundation of good speaking, some
additional practice will be necessary in the reading of more extended
passages. The extracts which follow range over almost every variety
of style, from simple narrative and description, and lively dialogue
and repartee, to the lofty line of Shakspeare and Milton. The
marginal references are intended to draw the attention of the pupil
to the alternations of thought and feeling in the passages selected,
so as to serve as a guide to their proper expression in reading and
delivery. The marks for emphasis in the earlier Exercises are de-
signed to indicate the words and phrases on which stress should be
laid ; the degree of such stress being left, under the guidance of
the teacher, to the judgment of the pupil. As he advances these
marks are discontinued, as it is considered that he will by that time
be able to dispense with such aids. A few practical directions are
appended, which it is hoped may not be without use to young
readers. The great rule for good reading, however, to which re-
ference has been more than once made a thorough mastery of the
sense-must be the constant aim of the learner. When this end
has been attained, nature and habit will spontaneously suggest the
proper delivery, and then rules or directions for the purpose become
unnecessary.
SHORT DIRECTIONS FOR YOUNG READERS.
1. When you read stand in an erect position, with your head well up, your
shoulders thrown back to expand the chest, and your face t
who hears you.
2. Hold your book about six or eight inches in front of the body, and as high
as the centre of the breast, so as not to compel you to stoop or to bend the head
in reading.*
3. Breathe as much as possible through the nostrils and not through the
mouth; and manage your inspirations so as not to create unnecessary pauses
or alterations in the tone of the voice in reading.
4. Read slowly, and with due attention to the stops, emphases, and pauses.
5. Pronounce each word distinctly, and be particular in articulating clearly
and audibly the final letters and syllables of words, and the closing words of
sentences.
6. Let the tones of your voice in reading be the same as if you were speaking.
7. Before reading any passage aloud, read it over carefully to yourself and
study it.

Education.
I CONSIDER a human soul without education, like
márble in the quàrry, which shows none of its in-
herent beauties until the skill of the polisher fetches Narration
out the colours, makes the surface shine, and dis-
covers every ornamental cloud, spot, and véin that
runs through the body of it. Education, after the
same manner, when it works upon a noble mind,
draws out to view every latent vìrtue and perfection, Comparisca
which, without such helps, are never áble to make
their appearance.
If my reader will give me léave to change the
allusion so soon upon him, I shall make use of the
same instance to illustrate the force of education,
which Aristotle has brought to explain his doctrine
of substantial forms, when he tells us that a statue
lies híd in a block of marble, and that the art of the
státuary only clears away the superfluous matter
and removes the rubbish. The figure is in the
stone, and the scúlptor only finds it. What sculpture
is to a block of marble, education is to a human
soul. The philosopher, the saínt, or the hèro—the Enumera-
wise, the good, or the great man-very often lies +
hid and concealed in a plebèian, which a proper
education might have disintérred, and have brought
to light. I am therefore much delighted with
reading the accounts of savage nations, and with
contemplating those vírtues which are wíld and un-
cultivated ; to see courage exerting itself in fièrce-
ness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in cúnning,
pátience in sullenness and despair.
It is an unspeakable blessing to be born in those
parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge
flourish; though it must be conféssed there are, Gratitude
even in thèse parts, several poor uninstructed per-
sons, who are but little above the inhabitants of
those nátions of which I have been here speaking ;
as those who have had the advantages of a more
liberal education, rise above one another by several
different degrees of perfection. For, to return to

If there be anything that makes húman nature

must be príde. They know so well the vanity of
those imáginary perfections that swell the heart of

Noble Revenge.
A YOUNG officer (in what army no matter) had so Narrative
far forgotten himself, in a moment of irritátion, as
to strike a private soldier, full of personal dignity
(as sometimes happens in all ranks), and distin-
guished for his courage. The inexorable laws of
military díscipline forbade to the injured soldier
any pràctical redress. He could look for no retaliá-
tion by acts. Words only were at his command;
and, in a tumult of indignation, as he turned away,
the soldier said to his officer that he would make Menace
him repènt it.' This, wearing the shape of a ménace,
naturally rekìndled the officer's anger, and inter-
cèpted any disposition which might be rising within
him towards a sentiment of remòrse ; and thus the
irritation between the two young men grew hótter
than before.
Some weeks after this a partial action took place Animated
with the enemy. Suppose yourself a spectator, and Description
looking down into a válley occupied by two armies.
They are facing each other, you see, in martial
arrày. But it is no more than a skirmish which is
going on ; in the course of which, however, an occa-
sion suddenly aríses for a desperate service. A
redoubt, which has fallen into the enemy's hands,
must be recaptured at any price, and under círcum-
stances of all but hopeless difficulty. A strong párty
has volunteered for the service ; there is a cry for
somebody to head them ; you see a soldier step out
froin the ranks to assume this dangerous leadership ;
the party moves rapidly fòrward ; in a few minutes
it is swallowed up from your eyes in clouds of
smoke ; for óne half-hour from behind these clouds
you receive hieroglyphic reports of bloody strìfe-
fierce repeating signals, flashes from the gùns, roll-

THE shades of night were falling fast,
As through an Alpine village passed
A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,
A banner with the strange device,
Excelsior!
2His brow was sad ; 3his eye beneath
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,
4 And like a silver clarion rung
The accents of that unknown tongue,--
Excelsior !
5In happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and bright;
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,
And from his lips escaped a groan,-
Excelsior!

Dark lowers the tempest overhead,
The roaring torrent is deep and wide!'
And loud that clarion voice replied,-

Thy weary head upon this breast !'
A tear stood in his bright blue eye,
But still he answered, with a sigh,-

Beware the awful avalanche!'
This was the peasant's last Good-night;

of Human Life.

POETS and Philosophers have delighted to compare the
course of human life to that of a river ; perhaps a still apter
simile might be found in the history of a glacier.
?Heaven-descended in its origin, it yet takes its mculd
and conformation from the hidden womb of the mountains
which brought it forth. At first, soft and ductile, it acquires
a character and firmness of its own, as an inevitable destiny
urges it in its onward career. Jostled and constrained by
the crosses and inequalities of its prescribed path, hedged in
by impassable barriers which fix limits to its movements, it
yields groaning to its fate, and still travels forward seamed
with the scars of many a conflict with opposing obstacles.
All this while, although' wasting, it is renewed by an un-
seen power--it evaporates, but is not consumed. On its
surface it bears the spoils which, during the progress of its
existence, it has made its own; often weighty burdens devoid
of beauty or value, - at times precious masses, sparkling
with gems or with ore.

stoops into an attitude of decrepitude ;-it drops the burdens,
one by one, which it had borne so proudly aloft ; its dissolu-
tion is inevitable. “But as it is resolved into its elements, it
takes all at once, a new, and livelier, and disembarrassed
form :—from the wreck of its members it arises, “another,
yet the same,'-a noble, full-bodied, arrowy stream, which
leaps rejoicing over the obstacles which before had staid its
progress, and hastens through fertile valleys towards a freer
existence, and a final union in the ocean with the Boundless
and the Infinite.

Hark! 'tis the twanging horn! O'er yonder bridge,
That with its wearisome but needful length
Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon
Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright,
He comes, the herald of a noisy world,
2With spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks,
News from all nations lumbering at his back.
True to his charge the close-packed load behind,
sYet careless what he brings, his one concern
Is to conduct it to the destined inn,
And having dropped the expected bag-pass on.
He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,
Cold and yet cheerful : messenger of grief
Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some,
To him indifferent whether grief or joy.

Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet

Or nymphs responsive, equally affect
His horse and him, unconscious of them all.

Of all the figures in that large family group which sur-
rounds George and his queen, the prettiest, I think, is the
father's darling, the Princess Amelia, pathetic for her beauty,
her sweetness, her early death, and for the extreme passion
ate tenderness with which her father loved her. This was
his favourite amongst all the children : of his sons, he loved
the Duke of York best. >Burney tells a sad story of the
poor old man at Weymouth, and how eager he was to have
this darling son with him. The King's house was not big
enough to hold the Prince ; and his father had a portable
house erected close to his own, and at huge pains, so that
his dear Frederick should be near him. He clung on his
arm all the time of his visit ; talked to no one else ; had talked
of no one else for some time before. The Prince, so long
expected, stayed but a single night. He had business in
London the next day, he said. The dulness of the old
King's court stupefied York and the other big sons of George
III. They scared equerries and ladies, frightened the
modest little circle with their coarse spirits and loud talk.
Of little comfort, indeed, were the King's sons to the King.
But the pretty Amelia was his darling; and the little
maiden, prattling and smiling in the fond arms of that old
father, is a sweet image to look on. . . . . . . . .
The Princess wrote verses herself, and there are some
pretty plaintive lines attributed to her, which are more
touching than better poetry :--

• Unthinking, idle, wild, and young,
I laughed, and danced, and talked, and sung:
And, proud of health, of freedom vain,
Dreamed not of sorrow, care, or pain:
Concluding, in those hours of glee,
That all the world was made for me.
• But when the hour of trial came,
When sickness shook this trembling frame,
When folly's gay pursuits were o'er,
And I could sing and dance no more,
It then occurred, how sad 'twould be
Were this world only made for me.'
The poor soul quitted it—and ere yet she was dead the
agonized father was in such a state, that the officers round
about him were obliged to set watchers over him, and from
November. 1810, George III. ceased to reign. All the
world knows the story of his malady; all history presents no
sadder figure than that of the old man, blind and deprived
of reason, wandering through the rooms of his palace, ad-
dressing imaginary parliaments, reviewing fancied troops,
holding ghostly courts. I have seen his picture as it was
taken at this time, hanging in the apartment of his daughter,
the Landgravine of Hesse Hombourg—amidst books and
Windsor furniture, and a hundred fond reminiscences of her
English home. The poor old father is represented in a
purple gown, his snowy beard falling over his breast—the
star of his famous Order still idly shining on it. He was not
only sightless : he became utterly deaf. All light, all reason,
all sound of human voices, all the pleasures of this world of
God, were taken from him. Some slight lucid moments he
had ; in one of which, the Queen, desiring to see him, entered
the room, and found him singing a hymn, and accompanying
himself at the har psichord. When he had finished, he
knelt down and prayed aloud for her, and then for his
jamily, and then for the nation, concluding with a prayer for
himself, that it might please God to avert his heavy calamity
from him, but if not, to give him resignation to submit. Ho
then burst into tears, and his reason again fled.
What preacher need moralise on this story ; what words
save the simplest are requisite to tell it? It is too terrible
for tears. The thought of such a misery smites me down in
submission before the Ruler of kings and men, the Monarch
Supreme over empires and republics, the inscrutable Dis-
spenser of life, death, happiness, victory. 660 brothers,' I

But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,

- It happened once, that a young Yorkshire clown,
But newly come to far-famed London town,
Was gaping round at many a wondrous sight,
Grinning at all he saw with vast delight,
Attended by his terrier, Tyke,
Who was as sharp, as sharp may be ,
And thus the master and the dog, d’ye see,
Were very much alike.
After wand'ring far and wide,
And seeing all the streets and squares,
And Temple Bar, and Cross's bears,
The Mansion-house, the Regent's Park,
And all in which your cocknies place their pride ;
After being quizz’d by many a city spark,
For coat of country cut, and red-hair'd pate,
He came at length to noisy Billingsgate;
He saw the busy scene with mute surprise,
Opening his ears and eyes
At the loud clamour, and the monstrous fish,
Hereafter doom'd to grace full many a dish.
Close by him was a turbot on a stall,
Who, with stretch'd mouth, as if to pant for breath,
Seem'd in the agonies of death :

A flat you see—so something like yourself.'

His mouth is open, put your finger in,
And then you'll know.''Why,' replied the wight,

Shall put his tail there, an' ye like.'

Who bit it too with all his might;

Than off he ran, the fish still holding tight;
And though old Ling began to swear and rail,

I may therefore now indulge in expressing feelings towards
it, which delicacy, rather to the law than the traffic, might,
before that period, have rendered it proper to suppress.
After a long and most unaccountable silence of the law on
this head, which seemed to protect, by permitting, or at least
by not prohibiting the traffic, it has now spoken out; and the
veil which it appeared to interpose being now withdrawn, it
is fit to let our indignation fall on those who still dare to
trade in human flesh, not merely for the frauds of common
smugglers, but for engaging in crimes of the deepest die ;-
Pin crimes always most iniquitous, even when not illegal; but
which are now as contrary to law as they have ever been to
honesty and justice. I must protest loudly against the abuse
of language, which allows such men to call themselves traders
or merchants. It is not commerce, but crime, that they are
driving. I too well know, and too highly respect that most
honourable and useful pursuit, that commerce, whose pro-
vince it is to humanise and pacify the world. So alien in its
nature to violence and fraud,-so formed to flourish in peace
and in honesty,—so inseparably connected with freedom, and
goodwill, and fair dealing, I deem too high of it to endure
that its name should, by a strange perversion, be prostituted
to the use of men who live by treachery, rapine, torture, and
murder ! I spoke literally and advisedly; I meant to use no
figurative phrase; and I know I was guilty of no exaggera-
tion: I was speaking of the worst form of that crime. For
ordinary murders there may even be some excuse. Revenge
may have arisen from the excess of feelings honourable in
themselves. A murder of hatred or cruelty, or mere blood-
thirstiness, can only be imputed to a deprivation of reason;
5but here we have to do with cool, deliberate, mercenary
murder ! nay, worse than this; for the ruffians who go on
the highway, or the pirates who infest the seas, at least ex-
pose their persons, and, by their courage, throw a kind of
false glare over their crimes. But these wretches durst not
do this; they employ others, as base as themselves, only
that they are less cowardly : they set on men to rob and kill,
in whose spoils they are willing to share, though not in their
dangers. Traders, or merchants, do they presume to call
themselves ? and in cities like London and Liverpool, the
very creations of honest trade? I, at length, will give them
the right name, and call them cowardly suborners of piracy
and mercenary murder !

The Grave.

tion. 5. Solemn entreaty. 6. Warning.
THE sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which
we refuse to be divorced. Every other wound we seek to
heal-every other affliction to forget ; but this wound we
consider it a duty to keep open—this affliction we cherish
and brood over in solitude..Where is the mother who
would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom
from her arms, though every recollection is a pang? Where
is the child that would willingly forget the most tender of
parents, though to remember be but to lament? Who,
even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over
whom he mourns ? Who, even when the tomb is closing
upon the remains of her he most loved ; when he feels his
heart, as it were, crushed in the closing of its portal ; would
accept of consolation that must be bought by forgetfulness?
No, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest
attributes of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its
delights; and when the overwhelming burst of grief is
calmed into the gentle tear of recollection; when the sudden
anguish and the convulsive agony over the present ruins of
all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive medi-
tation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness, who
would root out such a sorrow from the heart? Though it may
sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of
gaiety; or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom;
yet, who would exchange it, even for a song of pleasure, or
the burst of revelry? No, there is a voice from the tomb
sweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the dead to
which we turn even from the charms of the living. Oh,
the grave the grave Lit buries every error-covers every
defect-extinguishes every resentment. From its peaceful
bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections.
Who can look down upon the grave even of an enemy, and
not feel a compunctious throb, that he should ever have
warred with the poor handful of earth that lies mouldering
before him!
*But the grave of those we loved—what a place for medi-
tation! There it is that we call up in long review the whole
history of virtue and gentleness, and the thousand endear-
ments lavished upon us, almost unheeded in the daily course
of intimacy—there it is that we dwell upon the tenderness,
the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene. The bed
of death, with all its stifled griefs—its noiseless attendance-

its mute, watchful assiduities. The last testimonies of ex-
piring love! The feeble, fluttering, thrilling-oh! how
thrilling !-pressure of the hand. The last fond look of the
glazing eye, turning upon us, even from the threshold of
existence! The faint, faltering accents, struggling in death
to give one more assurance of affection !
5Ay! go to the grave of buried love, and meditate! there
settle the account with thy conscience for every past benefit
unrequited-every past endearment unregarded, of that de-
parted being, who can never-never-never return to be
soothed by thy contrition !
If thou art a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the
soul, or a furrow to the silver brow of an affectionate parent
-if thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the fond
bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms, to
doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth—if thou art
a friend, and hast ever wronged, in thought, or word, or
deed, the spirit that generously confided in thee—if thou art
a lover, and hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true
heart which now lies cold and still beneath thy feet ;—then
be sure that every unkind look, every ungracious word,
every ungentle action, will come thronging back upon thy
memory, and knocking dolefully at thy soul—then be sure
that thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the
grave, and utter the unheard groan, and pour the unavail-
ing tear; more deep, more bitter, because unheard and
unavailing.
Then weave thy chaplet flowers, and strew the beauties
of nature about the grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou
canst, with these tender yet futile tributes of regret ; but
take warning by the bitterness of this, thy contrite affliction
over the dead, and henceforth be more faithful and affection.

Been thus encountered :—a figure like your father
Arm’d at all points, exactly cap-à-pie,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them : thrice he walked
By their opprest and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his trincheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stood dumb and spoke not to him.

But answer made it none : yet once methought,

Itself to motion, like as it would speak :
But even then, the morning cock crew loud ;
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanished from our sight.

With golden waves ; and on thy mountains flocks
Bleat numberless ; while, roving round their sides,
Bellow the blackening herds in lusty droves.
Beneath, thy meadows glow, and rise unequalled
Against the mower's scythe. On every hand
Thy villas shine. Thy country teems with wealth;
And property assures it to the swain,
Pleased and unwearied in his guarded toil.
Full are thy cities with the sons of art;
And trade and joy, in every busy street,
Mingling are heard : even Drudgery himself,
As at the car he sweats, or dusty hews
The palace stone, looks gay. Thy crowded ports,
Where rising masts an endless prospect yield,
With labour burn, and echo to the shouts
Of hurried sailor, as he hearty waves
His last adieu, ind, loosening every sheet,
Resigns the spreading vessel to the wind.

Scattering the nations where they go ; and first

The River Amazon.
This noble stream, which exceeds in magnitude the largest
rivers in the Old World, takes its rise from two sources, the
one of which is found in the glaciers of Lauricocha (one of
the loftiest of the Cordillera range), the second in the summit
of Mount Caillonia, in the same lofty chain. Swelled by the
tributary streams of the Yupurce and the Rio Negro on the
• left bank, and by the Yavare, the Yutay, and the Yurna,
the Mugua, the Rio de los Capanachuas, and the Pachera,
on the right, it flows for a long period through mountain
gorges of prodigious depth and surpassing beauty. After
emerging from the Andes, it winds in a lazy current through
the immense savannahs of South America, and does not
reach the ocean till it has run a course of 315 leagues after
its junction with the Rio Negro.
From its source to the sea is 1,035 leagues, or 2,700 miles.
Its breadth, after it emerges into a plain, is generally from
two to three miles, and its depth is seldom less than eighty
fathoms. After its junction with the Xuaga, however, its
expanse becomes so great that in mid-channel the opposite
cuasts can hardly be seen, and it flows in a vast estuary, so
level that the traces of the tide are seen at the distance of
200 lengues from the sea coast. A vehement struggle ensues

at its mouth between the river flowing down and the tide
running up; twice every day they dispute the pre-eminence,
and animals equally with men withdraw from the terrible
conflict. In the shock of the enormous masses of water, a
ridge of surf and foam is raised to the height of 180 feet;
the islands in the neighbourhood are shaken by the strife;
the fishers, the boatmen, and the alligators withdraw trem-
bling from the shock. At spring-tides, such is the vehe-
mence of this collision, that the opposite waves precipitate
themselves on each other like hostile armies ; the shores are
covered to a great distance on either side with volumes of
foam ; huge rocks, whirled about like barks, are borne aloft
on the surface; and the awful roar, re-echoed from island to
island, gives the first warning to the far-distant mariner that
he is approaching the shores of South America.

sable pall as for the burial of yesterday; the clumps of dark
trees, their giant plumes of funeral feathers waving sadly to
and fro ; all hushed, all noiseless, and in deep repose, save
the swift clouds that skim across the moon, and the cautious
wind, as creeping after them upon the ground, it stops to
listen and goes rustling on, and stops again, and follows, like
a savage on the trail. Whither go the clouds and winds so
eagerly? If like guilty spirits they repair to some dread
conference with powers like themselves, in what wild region
do the elements hold council, or where unbend in terrible
disport? Here! Free from that cramped prison called
earth, and out upon the waste of waters ;-here, roaring,
raging, shrieking, howling all night long. Hither come the
sounding voices from the caverns on the coast of that small
island, sleeping a thousand miles away so quietly in the
midst of angry waves ; and hither, to meet them, rush the
blasts from unknown desert places of the world. Here, in
the fury of their unchecked liberty, they storm and buffet
with each other, until the sea, lashed into passion like their
own, leaps up in ravings mightier than theirs, and the whole
scene is whirling madness. On, on, on, over the countless
miles of angry space roll the long, heaving billows. Moun-
tains and caves are here, and yet are not, for what is now
the one, is now the other; then all is but a boiling heap of
rushing water, pursuit, and flight, and mad return of wave
on wave, and savage struggling, ending in a spouting up of
foam that whitens the black night; incessant change of place,
and form, and hue ; constancy in nothing but eternal strife.
On, on, on they roll, and darker grows the night, and louder
howl the winds, and more clamorous and fierce become the
million voices in the sea, when the wild cry goes forth upon
the storm, 'A ship!' Onward she comes, in gallant combat
with the elements, her tall masts trembling, and her timbers
starting on the strain ; onward she comes, now high upon
the curling billows, now low down in the hollows of the sea,
as hiding for the moment from its fury; and every storm
voice in the air and water cries more loudly yet, 'A ship!'
Still she comes striving on; and at her boldness and the
spreading cry, the angry waves rise up above each other's
hoary heads to look ; and round about the vessel, far as the
mariners on her decks can pierce into the gloom, they press
upon her, forcing each other down, and starting up and
rushing forward from afar, in dreadful curiosity. High over
her they break, and round her surge and roar, and, giving
place to others, moaningly depart, and dash themselves to
fragments in their baffled anger. Still she comes onward

Of tempests, and the dangers of the deep,
And pause at times, and feel that we are safe ·

Woo terror to delight us. But to hear
The roaring of the raging elements ;
To know all human skill, all human strength,
Avail not; to look around, and only see
The mountain-wave incumbent, with its weight
Of bursting waters, o'er the reeling bark ;
Ah, me! this is indeed a dreadful thing :
And he who hath endured the horror once
Of such an hour, doth never hear the storm
Howl round his home but he remembers it,
And thinks upon the suffering mariner.

Of flowers yet fresh with childhood ; on the ear

All silently their tears of love distil,

Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.
Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven,
If in your bright leaves, we would read the fate
Of men and empires,—'tis to be forgiven,
That in our aspirations to be great
Our destinies O'erleap their mortal state,
And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
A beauty and a mystery, and create
In us such love and reverence from afar,
That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a
star.
All heaven and earth are still,—though not in sleep,
But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep :-
All heaven and earth are still : From the high host
Of stars to the lulled lake, and mountain coast,
All is concentered in a life intense,
Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
But hath a part of being, and a sense
Of That which is of all Creator and Defence.
The sky is changed ! and such a change! Oh Night,
And Storm, and Darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,
From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
Leaps the live thunder !-not from one lone cloud,
But every mountain now hath found a tongue ;
And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,

And this is in the night :-Most glorious night!
Thou wert not sent for slumber ! let me be
A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,-
A portion of the tempest and of thee !
How the lit lake shines,-a phosphoric sea, -
And the big rain comes dancing to the earth !
And now again 'tis black-and now, the glee
Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,
As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake’s birth.

Ex. 54.
One Niche the Highest.
The scene opens with a view of the great Natural Bridge
in Virginia. There are three or four lads standing in the
channel below, looking up with awe to that vast arch of un-
hewn rocks which the Almighty bridged over those everlasting
butments, 'when the morning stars sang together.' The
little piece of sky spanning those measureless piers is full of
stars, although it is mid-day. It is almost five hundred feet
from where they stand, up those perpendicular bulwarks of
limestone to the key of that vast arch, which appears to
them only the size of a man's hand. The silence of death is
rendered the more impressive by the little stream that falls
from rock to rock down the channel. The sun is darkened,
and the boys have uncovered their heads, as if standing in
the presence-chamber of the Majesty of the whole earth. At
last this feeling begins to wear away; they look around them,
and find that others have been there before them. They see
the names of hundreds cut in the limestone butments. A
new feeling comes over their young hearts, and their knives
are in their hands in an instant. What man has done, man
can do,' is their watchword, while they draw themselves up,
and carve their names a foot above those of a hundred full-
grown men who have been there before them.
They are all satisfied with this feat of physical exertion, ex-
cept one, whose example illustrates perfectly the forgotten
truth, that there is no royal road to learning. This ambitious
youth sees a name just above his reach—a name which will be
green in the memory of the world when those of Alexander,
Cæsar, and Bonaparte shall rot in oblivion. It was the name
of Washington. Before he marched with Braddock to that
fatal field, he had been there and left his name, a foot above
any of his predecessors. It was a glorious thought to write his
name side by side with that great father of his country. He

grasps his knife with a firmer hand, and clinging to a little
jutting crag, he cuts again into the limestone, about a foot
above where he stands; he then reaches up and cuts another
for his hands. 'Tis a dangerous adventure ; but as he puts
his feet and hands into those gains, and draws himself up
carefully to his full length, he finds himself a foot above
every name chronicled in that mighty wall. While his com-
panions are regarding him with concern and admiration, he
cuts his name in wide capitals, large and deep, into that
flinty album. His knife is still in his hand, and strength in
his sinews, and a new-created aspiration in his heart. Again
he cuts another niche, and again he carves his name in larger
capitals. This is not enough; heedless of the entreaties of
his companions, he cuts and climbs again. The gradations
of his ascending scale grow wider apart. He measures his
length at every gain he cuts. The voices of his friends wax
weaker and weaker, till their words are finally lost on his ear.
He now for the first time casts a look beneath him. Had
that glance lasted a moment, that moment would have been
his last. He clings with a convulsive shudder to his little
niche in the rock. An awful abyss awaits his almost certain
fall. He is faint with severe exertion, and trembling from
the sudden view of the dreadful destruction to which he is
exposed. His knife is worn half-way to the haft. He can
hear the voices, but not the words, of his terror-stricken
companions below. What a moment! what a meagre chance
to escape destruction ! there is no retracing his steps. It is
impossible to put his hands into the same niche with his feet,
and retain his slender hold a moment. His companions
instantly perceive this new and fearful dilemma, and await
his fall with emotions that "freeze their young blood.' He
is too high to ask for his father and mother, his brothers
and sisters, to come and witness or avert his destruction.
But one of his companions anticipates his desire. Swift as
the wind, he bounds down the channel, and the situation of
the fated boy is told upon his father's hearthstone.
Minutes of almost eternal length roll on, and there are
hundreds standing in that rocky channel, and hundreds on
the bridge above, all holding their breath, and awaiting the
fearful catastrophe. The poor boy hears the hum of new and
numerous voices both above and below. He can just dis-
tinguish the tones of his father, who is shouting with all the
energy of despair,-- William ! William ! Don't look down!
Your mother, and Henry, and Harriet, are all here praying
for you! Don't look down ! Keep your eyes towards the
top?' The boy didn't look down. His eye is fixed like a

softest places in that vast pier! How he avoids every flinty

sister, on the very spot, where, if he falls, he will not fall.

himself directly under the middle of that vast arch of rock,
earth, and trees. He must cut his way in a new direction to
get from this overhanging mountain. The inspiration of
hope is in his bosom; its vital heat is fed by the increasing
shouts of hundreds perched upon cliffs, trees, and others
who stand with ropes in their hands upon the bridge above,
or with ladders below. Fifty more gains must be cut before
the longest rope can reach him. His wasting blade strikes
again into the limestone. The boy is emerging painfully foot
by foot, from under that lofty arch. Spliced ropes are in the
hands of those who are leaning over the outer edge of the
bridge. Two minutes more and all will be over. That blade
is worn to the last half-inch. The boy's head reels; his eyes.
are starting from their sockets. His last hope is dying in
his heart, his life must hang upon the next gain he cuts.
That niche is his last. At the last flint gash he makes, his
knife-his faithful knife-falls from his little nerveless hand,
and, ringing along the precipice, falls at his mother's feet.
An involuntary groan of despair runs like a death-knell
through the channel below, and all is still as a grave. At a
height of nearly three hundred feet, the devoted boy lifts his
hopeless heart and closing eyes to commend his soul to God !
'Tis but a moment, there ! one foot swings off !-he is reel-
ing—trembling-toppling over into eternity. Hark !-a shout
falis on his ear from above! The man who is lying with half
his length over the bridge, has caught a glimpse of the boy's.
head and shoulders. Quick as thought the noosed rope is
within reach of the sinking youth. No one breathes. With
a faint convulsive effort, the swooning boy drops his arm into
the noose. Darkness comes over him, and with the words
‘God!' and 'Mother!' whispered on his lips just loud
enough to be heard in heaven-the tightning rope lifts him
out of his last hollow niche. Not a lip moves while he is

The Song of Steam.
Harness me down with your iron bands-
Be sure of your curb and rein ;
For I scorn the power of your puny hands
As the tempest scorns a chain.
How I laughed, as I lay concealed from sight
For many a countless hour,
At the childish boast of human might,
And the pride of human power!
When I saw an army upon the land,
A navy upon the seas,
Creeping along, a snail-Íike band,
Or waiting the wayward breeze ;
When I marked the peasant faintly reel
With the toil which he daily bore,
As he feebly turn’d at the tardy wheel,
Or tugg'd at the weary oar.
When I measured the panting courser's speed,
The flight of the carrier dove,
As they bore the law a king decreed,
Or the lines of impatient love ;
I could not but think how the world would food
As these were outstripped afar
When I should be bound to the rushing keel,
Or chained to the flying car.
In the darksome depths of the fathomless mine
My tireless arm doth play,
Where the rock never saw the sun decline,
Or the dawn of a glorious day.
I bring earth’s glittering jewels up
From the hidden cave below,
And I make the fountain's granite cup
With a crystal gush overflow.

Ex. 56. The Schoolmaster and the Conqueror.
But there is nothing which the adversaries of improvement
are more wont to make themselves merry with than what is
termed the 'march of intellect ;' and here I will confess,
that I think, as far as the phrase goes, they are in the right.
It is a very absurd, because a very incorrect expression. It
is little calculated to describe the operation in question. It
does not picture an image at all resembling the proceedings of
the true friends of mankind. It much more resembles the
progress of the enemy to all improvement. The conqueror
moves in a march. He stalks onward with the 'pride, pomp,
and circumstance of war'_banners Aying-shouts rending
the air-guns thundering—and martial music pealing, to
drown the shrieks of the wounded, and the lamentations for
the slain. Not thus the schoolmaster, in his peaceful voca-
tion. He meditates and prepares in secret the plans which
are to bless mankind; he slowly gathers round him those
who are to further their execution--he quietly, though
firmly, advances in his humble path, labouring steadily, but
calmly, till he has opened to the light all the recesses of
ignorance, and torn up by the roots the weeds of vice. His
is a progress not to be compared with anything like a march;
but it leads to a far more brilliant triumph, and to laurels
more imperishable, than the destroyer of his species, the
scourge of the world, ever won. Such men-men deserving

them among the persevering, resolute, industrious Swiss; I
have found them among the laborious, the warmhearted,
the enthusiastic Germans; I have found them among the
highminded, but enslaved Italians ; and in our own country,
God be thanked, their number everywhere abound, and are
every day increasing. Their calling is high and holy ; their
fame is the property of nations ; their renown will fill the
earth in after ages, in proportion as it sounds not far off in
their own times. Each one of those great teachers of the
world, possessing his soul in peace, performs his appointed
course ; awaits in patience the fulfilment of the promises ;
and, resting from his labours, bequeaths his memory to the
generation whom his works have blessed, and sleeps under
the humble but not inglorious epitaph, commemorating one
in whom mankind lost a friend, and no man got rid of an

While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue

Vainly the fowler's eye
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.
Seek'st thou the plashy brink
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
On the chafed ocean-side ?
There is a Power, whose care
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,-
The desert and illimitable air,-
Lone wandering, but not lost.
All day thy wings have fanned,
At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
Though the dark night is near.

Grass.
Gather a single blade of grass, and examine for a minute,
· quietly, its narrow sword-shaped strip of fluted green.
Nothing, as it seems there, of notable goodness or beauty.
A very little strength, and a very little tallness, and a few
delicate long lines meeting in a point—not a perfect point
neither, but blunt and unfinished, by no means apparently
a much-cared-for example of Nature's workmanship; made,
as it seems, only to be trodden on to-day, and to-morrow to
be cast into the oven ; and a little pale hollow stalk, feeble
and flaccid, leading down to the dull brown fibres of roots.
And yet, think of it well, and judge whether of all the
gorgeous flowers that beam in summer air, and of all strong
and goodly trees, pleasant to the eyes or good for food-
stately palm and pine, strong ash and oak, scented citron,
burdened vine-there be any by man so deeply loved, by
God so highly graced, as that narrow point of feeble green.
It seems to me not to have been without a peculiar signi-
ficance that our Lord, when about to work the miracle, which
of all that He showed, appears to have been felt by the
multitude as the most impressive—the miracle of the loaves
-commanded the people to sit down by companies ‘upon
the green grass. He was about to feed them with the prin-
cipal produce of the earth and sea, the simplest representa-
tions of the food of mankind. He gave them the seed of the
herb : he bade them sit down upon the herb itself, which
was as great a gift, in its fitness for their joy and rest, as its
perfect fruit for their sustenance ; thus, in this single order

Rustenance of man, to the simplest and most despised of all
the leafy families of the earth. And well does it fulfil its
mission. Consider what we owe merely to the meadow grass,
to the covering of the dark ground by that glorious enamel,
by the companies of those soft, and countless, and peaceful
spears. The fields ! Follow but forth for a little time the
thoughts of all that we ought to recognise in those words.
All spring and summer is in them—the walks by silent,
scented paths—the rests in noonday heat-the joy of herds
and flocks—the power of all shepherd life and meditation-
the life of sunlight upon the world, falling in emerald
streaks, and in soft blue shadows, where else it would have
struck upon the bare, dark mould, or scorching dust-pastures
beside the pacing brooks—soft banks and knolls of lowly
hills—thymy slopes of down overlooked by the blue line of
lifted sea-crisp lawns all dim with early dew, or smooth in
evening warmth of barred sunshine, dinted by happy feet,
and softening in their fall the sound of loving voices : all
these are summed in those simple words; and these are not
all. We may not measure to the full the depth of this
heavenly gift, in our own land; though still, as we think of
it longer, the infinite of that meadow sweetness, would open
on us more and more, yet we have it but in part. Go out,
in the spring time, among the meadows that slope from the
shores of the Swiss lakes to the roots of their lower moun-
tains. There, mingled with the taller gentians and the
white narcissus, the grass grows deep and free; and as you
follow the winding mountain paths, beneath arching boughs
all veiled and dim with blossom,-paths that for ever droop
and rise over the green banks and mounds sweeping down in
scented undulation, steep to the blue water, studded here
and there with new-mown heaps, filling all the air with
fainter sweetness-look up towards the higher hills, where
the waves of everlasting green roll silently into their long
inlets among the shadows of the pines ; and we may, perhaps,
at last know the meaning of those quiet words of the 147th
Psalm, 'He maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.'
There are also several lessons symbolically connected with
this subject, which we must not allow to escape us. Observe,
the peculiar characters of the grass, which adapt it especially
for the service of man, are its apparent humility, and cheer-
fulness. Its humility, in that it seems created only for lowest
service,-appointed to be trodden on, and fed upon. Its
cheerfulness, in that it seems to exult under all kinds of
violence and suffering. You roll it, and it is stronger the
next day ; you mow it, and it multiplies its shoots, as if it

were grateful; you tread upon it, and it only sends up
richer perfume. Spring comes, and it rejoices with all the
earth, -glowing with variegated flame of flowers,—waving
in soft depth of fruitful strength. Winter comes, and though
it will not mock its fellow plants by growing then, it will not
pine and mourn, and turn colourless or leafless as they. It
is always green ; and is only the brighter and gayer for the
hoar-frost.

Ex. 59. Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel.
Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel, writing in a book of gold :-
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the presence in the room he said,
“What writest thou ?' The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, The names of those who love the Lord.'
And is mine one ?' said Abou. 'Nay, not so,'
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
But cheerly still ; and said, 'I pray thee then,
Write me as one who loves his fellow-men.'
The angel wrote and vanished. The next night
It came again with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had bless'
And lo ! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began
to move in, glittering like the morning star, full of life,

heart I must have to contemplate without emotion that
elevation and that fall ! Little did I dream that, when she
added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant,
respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the
sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom ;
little did I dream that I should have lived to see such
disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a
nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought ten
thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to
avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the

Death of Marie-Antoinette.
On Monday, the 14th of October, 1793, a cause is pending
in the Palais de Justice, in the new Revolutionary Court,
such as these old stone walls never witnessed,—the trial of
Marie-Antoinette. The once brightest of queens, now tar-
nished, defaced, forsaken, stands here at Fouquier-Tinville's
judgment-bar, answering for her life. The indictment was
delivered her last night. To such changes of human fortune
what words are adequate ? Silence alone is adequate.
Marie-Antoinette, in this her utter abandonment and hour
of extreme need, is not wanting to herself, the imperial
woman. Her look, they say, as that hideous indictment
was reading, continued calm ; "she was sometimes observed
moving her fingers as when one plays on the piano. You
discern, not without interest, across that dim revolutionary
bulletin itself, how she bears herself queen-like. Her
answers are prompt, clear, often of laconic brevity ; resolu-
tion, which has grown contemptuous, without ceasing to be
dignified, veils itself in calm words. 'You persist then in
denial ?'' "My plan is not denial; it is the truth I have
said, and I persist in that.'
At four o'clock on Wednesday morning, after two days
and two nights of interrogating, jury-charging, and other
darkening of counsel, the result comes out-sentence of
death! Have you anything to say?' The accused shook
her head without speech. Night's candles are burning out ;
and with her too time is finishing, and it will be eternity and
-day. This hall of Tinville's is dark, ill-lighted except where
she stands. Silently she withdraws from it, to die. : ..
Is there a man's heart that thinks without pity of those
long months and years of slow, wasting ignominy; of thy
birth, soft cradled in imperial Schönbrunn, the winds of
heaven not to visit thy face too roughly, thy foot to light on
softness, thy eye on splendour; and then of thy death, or
hundred deaths, to which the guillotine and Fouquier-Tin-
ville's judgment-bar were but the merciful end? Look
there, o man born of woman ! The bloom of that fair face
is wasted, the hair is grey with care ; the brightness of those
eyes is quenched, their lids hang drooping; the face is stony
pale, as of one living in death. Mean weeds, which her own
hand has mended, attire the queen of the world. The
death-hurdle where thou sittest pale, motionless, which only
curses environ, has to stop; a people, drunk with vengeance,
will drink it again in full draught, looking at thee there.

shudder with yet another pang; her startled blood yet again
suffuses with the hue of agony that pale face, which she
hides with her hands. There is there no heart to say, God
pity thee! O think not of these; think of Him whom thou
worshippest, the Crucified—who also treading the wine-press

and made it holy, and built of it a sanctuary of sorrow' for
thee and all the wretched. Thy path of thorns is nigh

The Death Bed.
We watched her breathing through the night,
Her breathing soft and low,
As in her breast the wave of life
Kept heaving to and fro.
So silently we seemed to speak,
So slowly moved about,
As we had lent her half our powers,
To eke her living out.
Our very hopes belied our fears,
Our fears our hopes belied,
We thought her dying when she slept,
And sleeping when she died.
For when the morn came dim and sad,
And chill with early showers,
Her quiet eyelids closed,-she had
Another morn than ours.

Resignation.
There is no flock, however watched and tended,
But one dead lamb is there !
There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,
But has one vacant chair !
The air is full of farewells to the dying,
And mournings for the dead;
The heart of Rachel, for her children crying,
Will not be comforted !

Let us be patient! These severe afflictions
Not from the ground arise,
But oftentimes celestial benedictions
Assume this dark disguise.
We see but dimly through the mists and vapours,
Amid these earthly damps ;
What seem to us but sad funereal tapers,
May be heaven's distant lamps.
There is no Death! What seems so is transition;
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
Whose portal we call death.
She is not dead,—the child of our affection,
But gone unto that school
Where she no longer needs our poor protection,
And Christ himself doth rule.
In that great cloister's stillness and seclusion,
By guardian angels led,
Safe from temptation, safe from sin's pollution,
She lives, whom we call dead.
Day after day we think what she is doing
In those bright realms of air;
Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,
Behold her grown more fair.
Thus do we walk with her, and keep unbroken
The bond which nature gives,
Thinking that our remembrance, though unspoken,
May reach her where she lives.
Not as a child shall we again behold her ;
For when with raptures wild
In our embraces we again enfold her,
She will not be a child ;
But a fair maiden, in her Father's mansion,
Clothed with celestial grace ;
And beautiful with all the soul's expansion
Shall we behold her face.
And though at times impetuous with emotion
And anguish long suppressed,
The swelling heart heaves moaning like the ocean,
That cannot be at rest –

Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on!
The night is dark, and I am far from home-
Lead Thou me on!
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene,-one step enough for me.
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on.
I loved to choose and see my path ; but now,
Lead Thou me on!
I loved the garish day, and spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will : remember not past years.
So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on,
O’er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone;
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

Mysterious Night ! when our first parent knew
Thee from report divine, and heard thy name,
Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
This glorious canopy of light and blue?
Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,
Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,
Hesperus with the host of heaven came,
And lo ! creation widened in man's view.
Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
Within thy beams, o sun ! or who could find,
Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,
That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind.

Ode on the Passions. ·
When Music, heavenly maid ! was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Throng'd around her magic cell ;
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possess'd beyond the Muse's painting,
By turns they felt the glowing mind
Disturb’d, delighted, rais'd, refin'd;
Till once, 'tis said, when all were fir'd,
Fill’d with fury, rapt, inspir’d,
From the supporting myrtles round
They snatch'd her instruments of sound;
And as they oft had heard apart
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each (for madness ruled the hour)
Would prove his own expressive pow'r.
First FEAR his hand, his skill to try,
Amid the chords, bewilder'd laid-
And back recoil'd, he knew not why,
E'en at the sound himself had made.
Next ANGER rush’d, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings own’d his secret stings :
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept with hurried hand the strings.
With woeful measures wan DESPAIR-
Low sullen sounds his grief beguil'd ;
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;
'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.
But thou, O HOPE! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure ?
Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail !
Still would her touch the strain prolong ;
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She call’d on Echo still through all the song ;
And where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close ;
And Hope enchanted smild, and wav'd her golden hair:

REVENGE impatient rose ;
He threw his blood-stain’d sword in thunder down,
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast so loud and dread,
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe
And ever and anon he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat ;
And though sometimes, each dreary pause betweeu,
Dejected PITY at his side
Her soul subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild unalter'd mien,
While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his
head.
Thy numbers, JEALOUSY, to nought were fix'd ;
Sad proof of thy distressful state ;
Of diff'ring themes the veering song was mix'd,
And now it courted LOVE, now raving call’d on HATE.
With eyes uprais’d, as one inspir'd,
Pale MELANCHOLY sat retir'd,
And from her wild sequester'd seat,
In notes by distance made more sweet,
Pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul;
And dashing soft from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels join'd the sound ;
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole:
Or o'er some haunted streams with fond delay
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musing,
In hollow murmurs died away.

Laodamia.*
• With sacrifice before the rising morn
Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired ;
And from the infernal Gods, ’mid shades forlorn
Of night, my slaughtered lord have I required ;
Celestial pity I again implore :
Restore him to my sight-great Jove, restore !
So speaking, and by fervent love endowed
With faith, the suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;
While, like the sun emerging from a cloud,
Her countenance brightens—and her eye expands;
Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;
And she expects the issue in repose.
O terror ! what hath she perceived ? O joy!
What doth she look on ? Whom doth she behold ?
Her hero slain upon the beach of Troy?
His vital presence ? his corporeal mould ?
It is - if sense deceive her not—'tis He !
And a god leads him, winged Mercury !
Mild Hermes spake—and touched her with his wand
That calms all fear : Such grace hath crowned thy prayer,
Laodamia ! that at Jove's command
Thy husband walks the paths of upper air :
He comes to tarry with thee three hours' space ;
Accept the gift ; behold him face to face !
Forth sprang the impassioned Queen her lord to clash;
Again that consummation she assayed ;
But unsubstantial form eludes her grasp
As often as that eager grasp was made.
The phantom parts—but parts to re-unita,
And re-assume his place before her sight.
· Protesilaus, lo ! thy guide is gone !
Confirm, I pray, the vision with thy voice :
This is our palace,-yonder is thy throne ;
Speak, and the floor thou tread'st on will rejoice.
Not to appal me have the Gods bestowed
This precious boon; and blest a sad abode.'
Great Jove, Laodamia ! doth not leave
His gifts imperfect :-spectre though I be,
I am not sent to scare thee or deceive;
But in reward for thy fidelity.
* Laodamia, after her husband Protesilaus was slain before Troy, begged the
Gods to allow her to see him for only three hours. The request was granted;
and when Protesilaus was carried back by Hermes, Laodamia died of grief.

For this the passion to excess was driven,
That self might be annulled ; her bondage prove
The fetters of a dream, opposed to love.'

Round the dear shade she would have clung—'tis vain :
The hours are past-too brief had they been years ;
And him no mortal effort can detain.
Swift, towards the realms that know no earthly day,
He through the portal takes his silent way,
And on the palace floor a lifeless corse she lay.
She-who, though warned, exhorted, and reproved,
Thus died, from passion desperate to a crime
By the just Gods, whom no weak pity moved,
Was doomed to wear out her appointed time,
Apart from happy ghosts, that gather flowers
Of blissful quiet ’mid unfading bowers.
Yet tears to mortal suffering are due;
And mortal hopes defeated and o’erthrown
Are mourned by man,-and not by man alone,
As fondly he believes.—Upon the side
Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)
A knot of spiry trees for ages grew
From out the tomb of him for whom she died;
And ever, when such stature they had gained
That Ilium's walls were subject to their view,
The trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
A constant interchange of growth and blight.

Then before her time she diod.

Walking up and pacing down,

All the heavens, seem to twinkle

From the bells, bells, bells, bells-
From the jingling and the tingling of the bells.

What a world of happiness their harmony foretells !
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight !
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune.
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloiis
On the moon !
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells !
How it swells ;-how it dwells
On the Future ! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing

Hear the loud alarum bells-Brazen bells !
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells !
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune.
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire',
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavour
Now-now to sit or never,

Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

Had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
And on that cheek, an d o'er that brow,

But tell of days of goodness spent.

Proudly rainparted with rocks —
And Ocean, 'mid his uproar wild,
Speaks safely to his island-child !
Hence, for many a fearless age
Has social Quiet loved thy shore
Nor ever proud invader's rage
Or sacked thy towers, or stained thy fields with gore.

THE ELEMENTS OF EUCLID.
PROP. 1.—PROBLEM.
To describe an equilateral triangle upon a given finite straight line.
*(References.-Def. 15; ax. 1; post. 1, 3.)
Let AB be the given straight line.
It is required to describe on AB an equilateral triangle.
E
CONSTRUCTION
From the centre A, at the distance AB, describe the circle BCD;
(post. 3)
from the centre B, at the distance BA, describe the circle ACE;
and from the point C, in which the circles cut one another, draw the
straight lines CA, CB, to the points A, B. (post. 1.)
Then ABC shall be an equilateral triangle.
DEMONSTRATION
Because the point A is the centre of the circle BCD,
therefore AC is equal to AB; (def. 15)
and because the point B is the centre of the circle ACE,
therefore BC is equal to BA.
But it has been proved that CA is equal to AB;
therefore CA, CB are each of them equal to AB;
but things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another ;
(ax. 1)
therefore CA is equal to CB ;
-
wherefore CA, AB, BC are equal to one another;
and the triangle ABC is therefore equilateral;
and it is described upon the given straight line AB.
Which was required to be done.

From cent. A, with rad. AB, desc. O BCD, (Post. 3.)
from cent. B, with rad. BA, desc. O ACE, (Post. 3.)

Then ABC is an equilat. A.
A is cent. O BCD,
AC = AB (Def. 15.)
And
B is cent. O ACE,
BC = AB (Def. 15.)

HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY.
Marked for the Pause and Emphasis of Feeling.
TO BE - or not to be - that is the question ; .
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune -
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And - by opposing - end them ? - To DIE? - TO SLEEP -
No more - and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to - 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. TO DIE - TO SLEEP •
TO SLEEP! - Perchance to - DREAM! - Ay, there's the rub-
For in that sleep of DEATH what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil -
Must give us pause. THERE's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time.
The oppressor's wrong - the proud man's contumely -
The pangs of despis'd love - the law's delay -
The insolence of office - and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes -
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life -
But that the dread of SOMETHING after death -
The undiscovered country - from whose bourn
No traveller returns - puzzles the will -
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus CONSCIENCE does make cOWARDS of us all.

mine 4 honour ; and have respect to mine honour, that you
may believe. 3 Censure me, in your wisdom; and awake
your senses, that you may the better judge.—If there be
any in this assembly, any dear friend of Cæsar's, 6 to him I
say, that Brutus' love to Cæsar was no less than his. 10 If,
then, that friend demand why Brutus rose against Cæsar,
6 this is my answer; not that I loved Cæsar less, but that I
loved Rome more. Had you rather Cæsar were living, and
die all slaves ; 10 than that Cæsar were dead, to live all free-
men ?–4 As Cæsar loved me, I weep for him ; 6 as he was
fortunate, I rejoice at it; las he was valiant, I honour him ;
