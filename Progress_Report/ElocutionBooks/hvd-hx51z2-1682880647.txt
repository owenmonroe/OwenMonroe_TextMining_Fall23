PRE FACE.
WHEN I delivered, as usual, my Public Introductory
Lecture to the students forming the Class for the Study
and Practice of the Art of Public Reading and Speaking,
in the Evening Class Department of King's College, London,
at the beginning of the present Winter Session, I did not in
the least anticipate it would be favoured with the gratifying
and flattering notices it received from the Times, Daily News,
Lancet, and other leading organs of the Press. To them all
I beg to express my most sincere thanks and grateful sense
of obligation.
I regret that the incessant work of my vocation has
delayed until the present time my being able to comply
with the request with which I have been honoured for its
publication; but the Lecture, save as regards the citation
of authorities, was wholly extempore, and it is only now that
I have been able to find time to reproduce in writing the
thoughts to which I gave expression in my opening address,
on the evening of October 7th, together with such additions.
and authorities as might render it more worthy of being
presented to the general public.

THE CULTURE OF VOICE AND SPEECH.
I HAVE invited you here this evening, in pursuance of the
course I have adopted ever since I have had the honour of
holding my present appointment in this College, to listen to
some introductory remarks in reference to the special work
entrusted to my charge in this department, and which I
have ventured to term "A Lecture on Elocution, considered
in reference to Public and Social Life."
The great German philosopher, Wilhelm von Humboldt,
who has been so justly termed the father of Comparative
Philology, in discussing the subject of language generally,
says: "We must exclude from the definition of language
everything but actual speaking.
The essence of
language lies in the living utterance-in that which does not
suffer itself to be apprehended in the sundered elements of
written words.
It is only by the spoken word that
the speaker breathes, as it were, his own life into the souls
of his hearers.
Written language is only an im-
perfect and mummy-like embalming, of which the highest
use is that it may serve as a means of re-producing the living
utterance." And more recently the Rev. Canon Kingsley,
in one of his delightful essays, begins it with the remark
that: "To the minute philosopher few things seem more
miraculous than human speech."
Let the assertions, then, of the philosopher and the divine,
serve as the text for the discourse which I propose offering
you this evening, on the importance of cultivating, to the

utmost of our ability, those faculties of the mind and those.
organs of the body, which, in their just combination of action,
and in their highest order of development, constitute the
accomplished speaker or reader, or in other words the science.
and art of elocution. Let me endeavour to show you why
elocution should form a part of our education-not only as
regards the effects to be produced on others, when we read
or speak, but as regards its reflex advantages on ourselves,
not merely mentally, but physically. Let me support my
various assertions, and the propositions I hope to establish
to your satisfaction, by the testimony of authorities of the
highest order, and against whom no possible suspicion can
exist of having any personal interest to serve. Let me try,
at least, fairly to examine and answer some of the principal
objections which have, from time to time, been brought
against the study of elocution by persons who, I think,
have not maturely considered what true elocution really is,
and have confounded two things we are but too apt to
confuse in our progress through life-viz., abuse with use.
This, then, is the outline of the course I propose taking
this evening; and to which, without further preface, I now
solicit your kind attention.
It is well, in all discussions, that we should start, if
possible, with clear definitions of our subjects, and that our
terms should be accurately defined. My subject then,
to-night, is elocution, and the two aspects under which I
propose to regard it, are (1) In reference to Public, and (2)
In regard to Social Life.
Let me take these, then, in their due order. What do I
mean by elocution? Suppose I answer this question first
of all in a somewhat negative fashion, and tell you what I
do not mean whenever I have occasion to make use of
this much abused word-elocution. I do not mean, then,
anything pompous, stilted, bombastic, or "stagey." I do


## p. 7 (#11) ###############################################

7
not mean anything pedantic, stiff, formal, or unnatural.
If elocution either meant, or, properly understood and
rightly taught, tended to anything of the kind, I should
be the very last to say one word on its behalf, either here
or elsewhere.
So much, then, for the negative portion of my answer;
and now let me try to give you the affirmative. If you
ask me to define what it is I do mean by elocution, I think
I should reply somewhat in the following manner: I should
say, first of all, it is the perfectly audible, distinct, pure, and
effective pronunciation which is given to words when they
are arranged into sentences, and form written or extempo-
raneous composition, either in the shape of prose or poetry.
Besides this purity of intonation and clearness of articula-
tion, I include under the term all those appropriate inflec-
tions and modulations of the speaking voice: the due
observance of the great physiological law of poise; the
notation of another element, scarcely less important, that
of Quantity; proper pauses, and right discrimination in
degrees of emphasis, all of which are requisite in order
to render delivery most effective in its results, not only
as regards the judgment and intellect, but the feelings
and emotions of those whom we address. Nor does my
definition stop here; for I include, moreover, when suit-
able to the occasion, all the ever varying accompaniments
of the human countenance and figure-the manifold play
of feature, attitude, and gesture. And I do so because
nature has a language unspoken as well as spoken, and
the flash of indignation from the eye, the frown of anger on
the brow, the lip smiling with pleasure, or curled in scorn
and contempt-nay, the simple raising of a hand in appeal
or in deprecation will often convey the particular passion or
emotion of the moment as eloquently as any words can do,
however aptly chosen. Thus, then, you will see that under


## p. 8 (#12) ###############################################

8
my definition of elocution, I mean a delivery which not
only expresses fully the grammatical or logical sense of
all the words employed, so as to be thoroughly heard,
understood, and felt by the hearer, but, at the same time,
gives the whole sentence which such words compose all
the power, beauty, grace, and melody of which its form
of construction is capable. And last, though not least,
in the elements of my definition is the knowledge of
the means by which all this may be done with personal
ease, freedom, and self-possession on the part of the speaker
or reader, when he is made acquainted with the physiology
and proper use of the respiratory, vocal, and speech organs
in their due co-ordination of action.
This, then, is my ideal of elocution; a high one, I confess !
But it is well, in all that is deserving of study, whether in
the world of art, science, or ethics, to keep a high ideal before
us; to which let us strive our utmost to approximate, even
though that ideal we may never hope actually to attain.
That elocution, then, is an art which requires much study
to develope it in all its full power and beauty, even when
nature has been liberal in bestowing a fine and flexible voice
and quickness of appreciation in matters of taste and sym-
pathy of feeling, will, I think, be conceded without much
hesitation. This, being conceded, we come now to the all-
important question-are we sufficiently rewarded for all the
time, thought, and study, we may give to the acquisition of
this art? Are we sufficiently requited for all the pains we
may bestow in becoming thoroughly acquainted with its
theory, and then carrying out and developing that theory in
practice? I think we are, both in regard to public and
social life. Let me glance, first, at those spheres of life,
which we may term public, and under which head I would
take, as illustrations, the minister of religion generally, with-
out reference to any particular church or creed; the advocate

in our courts of law, and the speakers in our houses of
parliament and at public meetings. All these so far
resemble each other in their vocation that their aim is,
when engaged in their professional or public duties, to
convince the judgment of their hearers of the truth or
soundness of the views which the speaker is enforcing, or
else to persuade them to a certain course of conduct or
action. The minister of religion, moreover, has, by the
mode in which his more specially sacred functions are
performed, to endeavour to excite, to the fullest degree,
the devotional feelings of his congregation. And through
what channel are all these desired ends and aims to be
attained? Through words spoken by the living human
voice, with all its marvellous sympathetic powers of into-
nation, inflection, and modulation, enforced as
enforced as far as
possible by the expression of the countenance and gesture.
Let me venture to quote a few passages-not from any
professional writer on, or teacher of, elocution (for that, as I
said at first, I shall avoid doing as much as possible), but
from an article lately published by an eminent American
divine (the Rev. E. Kirk, of Boston), "on the preparation
required for the public duties of the ministry," which is not
less applicable to the subject, I think, in England than in
America:-
-
"It is easy to recognize the difference between a speaker
who is agreeable and one who is disagreeable; between one
who is powerful and another who is feeble. Nor can any
one entertain a doubt whether the difference is not just as
obvious in the pulpit as in the senate, forum, or on the public
platform. Every preacher, I should think, would desire so
to deliver his sermon as that his meaning should be clearly
perceived, and his sentiments deeply felt, rather than to utter
it in a manner unintelligible and unimpressive. Every con-
gregation of worshippers would prefer in their pastor a good

10
delivery to an awkward and disagreeable style of speaking.
Let two men of equal piety and scholarship be presented to
any of our religious societies, the one a man of easy, becom-
ing carriage in the pulpit, of apparently simple, natural, and
powerful utterance; the other uncouth in attitude and move-
ment, indistinct and stammering in his enunciation, and
wearisome in his drawling tones. Can any man in his
senses doubt which of the two would be chosen? No!
Thus far the case is plain. But if we go back from this,
and observe this finished speaker practising in the detail of
his studies and vocal exercises, there we shall find some
demurring. Many who admire the orator are averse to the
process of discipline which gave him the better style. There
is, in other words, a prejudice in the community, and among
many excellent candidates for the ministry, in regard to
elocution as an art to be obtained by study and practice.
This prejudice is worthy of a candid examination and an
earnest effort to remove it. In the minds of some, the study
and practice of elocution is connected, if not identified, with
the idea of substituting sound and emotion for sense and
truth. To such persons it may be suggested that there is no
necessity for this substitution. The importance of elocution
pre-supposes the importance of other things; and for men.
who are morally and intellectually qualified to act as preachers,
the importance of effective delivery and manner can scarcely
be overrated. To overlook it is a proof neither of piety,
dignity, nor wisdom. If there were some ethereal way of
communicating with the mind, if the process of preaching
were designed to be mesmeric, and people were to be put to
sleep, instead of being aroused, in order to instruct and im-
press them, we might dispense with elocution and the culture
it requires. But so long as men are in the body, it will be
found requisite for the most effective exercise of the ministry
that a part of clerical education consists in the study and


## p. 11 (#15) ##############################################

11
practice of elocution. That necessity is founded on these two
facts-that the communication of thought and feeling de-
pends upon the right exercise of our bodily organs; and
that those organs are within the domain of that great law
which requires the cultivation of the faculties. It is not
sufficient for the purposes of electrical power that the battery
be fully charged: a good conductor must be added. Alas!
how much of the preaching to which we have to listen is of
the class of non-conductors! In the minds of others, again,
elocution is identified with an ostentatious exhibition of the
graces and the accomplishments of the speaker. But this is
confounding the use with the abuse of a good thing. Since
it is a man who is to be heard and seen, and since there is
but one right way of speaking or reading aloud, while there
are a thousand wrong ways, the man will do well to learn the
right way. And if the agreeable impression produced by
an agreeable voice, manner, and person can conduce to the
right impression of truth, the very purity of his desire to do
good should induce him to cultivate voice, manner, and
person. There is nothing in the study of elocution, rightly
understood and practised, that need awaken personal vanity.
Nor is there any more inducement for an eloquent man to
display all the means by which he acquired the power of
commanding the sympathies and interest of his audience
than there is for a learned man to parade all his learning, or
to become a mere pedant. Others fear that they shall be
tempted to turn their chief attention in the pulpit to tones
and gestures, and thus degrade their high vocation. This,
again, is no necessary consequence, and would be simply a
perversion of the art. The greatest orator, in an extempo-
raneous address, pays strict attention to the minutest rules
of grammar, but there is no interruption in all this to the
concentrated action of his understanding; no extinction to
the fiery current of his feeling. The rules of elocution are

12
designed to form the man, to correct the bad habits of atti-
tude, speech, and gesture, and to make the voice, countenance,
and body in every way fit instruments for a mind full of noble
thoughts and powerful emotions.”
There is one objection more to which I turn, and
which I hope to answer, and then I proceed to a different
part of my subject. You may have heard well meaning
persons, but who cannot, I think, have maturely considered
the matter, object to the resources of the art of elocution
(which, after all, means only the aggregate of all that
constitutes a good delivery), being introduced into the
reading-desk and pulpit, and say that it savours of irreverence
to privately rehearse, over and over again, public prayers
addressed to the Deity, or to read the lessons from the Bible,
with all the rules of elocution so fully carried out, that the
standard which has been set up for the right performance of
their various ministerial functions shall be satisfied; and
that to study the most effective manner in which a sermon
can be delivered, as a great tragedian would study the part
he has to perform, is to reduce the high calling of the
preacher to an unworthy level. Now, in answer to this, let
me, in the first place, ask-how is the singing of hymns and
anthems managed in our cathedrals, churches, and chapels ?
Is their conducting left to persons wholly unskilled in
the art of vocal music? Do not organists and choristers
meet and practise, and rehearse, over and over again, the
anthems, psalms, and hymns they have to sing, until all is
thought of sufficient excellence to be played and sung in
public worship? Why? I presume for one reason, to warm
and excite, as much as possible, the devotional feelings of
the congregation. Now, then, I ask, are psalms, hymns,
and anthems, less direct appeals to God, than the prayers in
our Liturgy; and do not all claim to be parts of divine
service? I answer, what is not thought to be waste of time


## p. 13 (#17) ##############################################

13
nor irreverence in the one case is equally neither waste of
time nor irreverence in the other.
In the Contemporary Review, for the month of October,
1872, in a very scholarly article, entitled "The Ethics of
Ritual," by the Rev. J. B. Mayor, you will find this passage,
which I think very applicable to my subject:-
“The readings from the Bible, when we pass beyond those
narrative passages, which can never be wholly without
interest, even for the least awakened mind, call for much
thought and much knowledge to understand their general
drift.
If we have fallen into the habit (so much
fostered by our sermons) of looking upon each text, merely
as a peg on which to hang a meditation, without reference
to the context, or the readers to whom it was primarily
addressed, 'the Word' will be no light to our eyes, or
guide to our feet; we shall simply see our own fancies
reflected everywhere. There is no learning-no advance.
Much may be done by an intelligent reader to enforce
the meaning of what he reads by variation of tone, and
pause, and emphasis. Such semi-dramatic reading seems
to us to be almost essential, if the minds of the uneducated
are to be reached; and for their sakes, at any rate, we
much regret the prevalent use of the monotone in reading
the lessons in ritualistic churches."
•
To read the Liturgy and to preach a sermon well is an art
that requires just as much to be studied and practised as the
singing of hymns and anthems is an art that requires proper
training and cultivation. If we are to have public worship
at all, I say every part of it should be made as excellent
as possible, and no part of it be in any way neglected.
And now I glance very briefly-for my time is limited,
and I have other topics on which I desire to touch before
I finish my remarks-at the professions of the advocate,
the lecturer, and public speakers generally. I am perfectly


## p. 14 (#18) ##############################################

14
well aware that anything like grandiloquence, declamation,
poetical flights, and rhetorical appeals are quite alien to our
present national character. Modern taste and general tone
of thought and feeling in our English courts of justice are
utterly opposed to all useless declamatory froth and mere rhe-
torical display. And certainly it is only comparatively but
rarely that the circumstances of a case afford any just ground
for what would be termed the higher flights of eloquence; and
in the present day perspicuity of language and earnestness
of manner are, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the
chief requisites of an advocate, as well as of public speakers
generally. Still the barrister is not always arguing dry,
abstruse, and intricate points of law before Courts of Equity,
or Judges sitting in Banco; and in one branch of it, at least,
he will have to address juries drawn from many grades of
society in the metropolis, as well as at assizes and sessions,
with whom, I am disposed to think, a powerful delivery and
earnest manner have, to say the least, a very strong influence.
Well, what advantages will the advocate, lecturer, or
public speaker derive from a knowledge of elocution? I
can answer these, at any rate. He will learn the mode
in which the speaking voice is formed, so as to fill easily
the whole area of the court or hall in which his duties have
to be performed; and he will learn the secret of combining
distinctness with audibility, so that nothing shall be lost of
what he has to say to his hearers; and he will acquire
the means of delivering the most important words and
passages in the most effective manner. He will obtain,
too, such a mastery and power of discipline over his
voice as to be able to control it, from the loudest tone
down to little more than a mere whisper, and be able to
properly inflect and modulate it, according to the results
he wishes to produce upon his hearers. There are, I
think, no small advantages as regards others; but are


## p. 15 (#19) ##############################################

15
there any more selfish benefits which a knowledge of
elocution will confer upon the public speaker or reader
himself? There are, most undoubtedly. It cannot be
too strongly insisted upon that there is a wrong, as well
as a right, way of using the vocal and speech organs in
all public speaking and reading. If there is a way of
diminishing the exhaustion and lessening the sense of
fatigue after speaking or reading in public; if there is
a way of preventing altogether some of the much com-
plained of disastrous physical effects of public speaking
and reading, surely a wise and prudent man will not
think the matter beneath his notice. By the disastrous
effects, I mean the malady commonly known as "clerical
sore-throat," and kindred diseases, which result from a
disarrangement of the functions of the throat and chest.
It cannot be too strongly urged that there is a mode
of employing the vocal organs in the larynx which most
needlessly and seriously inflames the membrane that lines
the throat, and the delicate structure of the bronchial
tubes; and uselessly wastes the general nervous energy
of the system. All this could be entirely avoided by
learning to use the various organs of voice and speech
in their right sequence of action, so that proper respira-
tion, vocal utterance, and the law of poise be all duly
and harmoniously carried on. Then an hour's speaking
or reading aloud will be, not a fatigue for the body, but
merely a healthful and beneficial exercise. Is this any
exaggeration? I have the testimony afforded by the
experience of many public speakers and preachers, who,
by proper exercises, have entirely recovered the use of
the vocal powers they had lost, and have acquired the
power of speaking or preaching with an ease to which
they were previously entire strangers. Let me content
myself with only one, a clergyman (the Rev. Ch. Butcher),


## p. 16 (#20) ##############################################

16
who kindly permits me to quote his words, and who says:
"I assure you, I formerly felt more fatigued after reading
the Litany in a small country church than I do now after
taking three full services in the large church of St. Clement
Danes, Strand, in every part of which I am told that I am dis-
tinctly heard."* There can be no doubt (to use the words of
Professor McIlvaine of New York) that those wasting throat
diseases, with which clergymen are afflicted more than any
other class of public speakers, are traceable physiologically
to bad management of the voice, to the violation of those
laws which nature has prescribed; laws which, like all others
established by the God of nature, can never be violated with
impunity. This view is confirmed by the fact, to which
many can bear witness, that no more effectual remedy for
those diseases has been discovered than a course of sound
elocutionary training.
Now, then, I come to another division of my subject. I
have to regard elocution as I have defined it, in its relation-
ship to social life. I contend that, when properly understood
and practised, it is worthy of taking rank as one of the fine
arts.-Rather a bold proposition, it may be said. Well, let
me ask, what are the fine arts? You will answer, doubtless,
music, vocal and instrumental, the dramatic art, painting,
drawing, sculpture, architecture in its highest forms, etc.
Yes, but why do you call these arts fine arts? I suppose
you will answer somewhat after this manner- “We call
them fine arts, because they are all of them arts that give
beauty and grace to civilized life; or they are arts which
combine, in a high degree, the gratification of pure and
*The same clergyman, now the Consular Chaplain at Shanghai, China,
in a letter I have received from him since the delivery of this lecture, dated
from the Chaplaincy, Shanghai, August 18th, 1873, says :-"I am sure
elocution is the healthiest thing in the world. I have an immense church,
and three services a day-and this with the thermometer at 90° for three
months of the year—and yet I am never ill, or sensible of fatigue."


## p. 17 (#21) ##############################################

17
refined taste, with the exercise of an enlightened intellect
and an exalted imagination. If this is a true definition of
the fine arts (and none I fancy will question it), then I
think that elocution as shown, not in the elaborate and
impassioned speech of the great statesman, advocate, or
divine, but in a much humbler and more ordinary form,
may be ranked in the same category. Let me take the
instance of some simple, though beautiful poem, read aloud
in the family or social circle; and then, if it has been
rendered with purity of intonation, and all those proper
inflections and modulations of the voice, together with due
discrimination in emphasis, and all the other elements
requisite to convey the true meaning and expression, let
me ask whether it is not one of those arts which impart
a charm to social intercourse, and lend a grace to ordinary
life-in a word, whether it is not one of the fine arts?
When all the requisites that form a really good reader are
taken into consideration, I think we may well wonder, not
so much that the accomplishment is far too generally
neglected, but that it does not form, with all who look upon
education in its true light and meaning, the drawing out
of all our best faculties, an important means in early—nay,
in all stages of life, as well as in all classes of society, for
refining and elevating the mind, for cultivating the sym-
pathies, and for quickening and developing those habits of
perception and appreciation of the beautiful in all arts,
which, when once acquired, generally endure throughout
life, and are so precious in themselves, and so valuable to us
and our fellow-creatures.
One of the greatest thinkers of our age whose loss is felt
to be more than a national calamity—for it is a loss, indeed,
to the philosophy of the civilized world, I mean John Stuart
Mill-thus, in his autobiography, just published, speaks of
elocution :-

"In going through Plato and Demosthenes, since I could
now read these authors, as far as the language was con-
cerned, with perfect case, I was not required to construe
them sentence by sentence, but to read them aloud to my
father, answering questions when asked; but the particular
attention which he paid to elocution (in which his own
excellence was remarkable) made this reading aloud to
him a most painful task. Of all things which he required
me to do, there was none which I did so constantly ill,
or in which he so perpetually lost his temper with me.
He had thought much on the principles of the art of
reading, especially the most neglected parts of it, the in-
flections and modulations of the voice, as writers on elocution
call them (in contrast with articulation on the one side, and
expression on the other), and had reduced it to rules,
grounded on the logical analysis of a sentence. These
rules he strongly impressed upon me, and took me sev
severely
to task for every violation of them; but I even then remarked
(though I did not venture to make the remark to him) that,
though he reproached me when I read a sentence ill, he never,
by reading it himself, showed me how it ought to be read. A
defect running through his otherwise admirable modes of
instruction, as it did through all his modes of thought, was
that of trusting too much to the intelligibleness of the
abstract, when not embodied in the concrete. It was at a
much later period of my youth, when practising elocution
by myself, or with companions of my own age, that I, for
the first time, understood the object of his rules, and saw the
psychological ground of them. At that time, I and others
followed out the subject into its ramifications, and could
have composed a very useful treatise, grounded on my
father's principles. He, himself, left those principles
and rules unwritten. I regret that when my mind was
full of the subject, from systematic practice, I did not

put them, and our improvements of them, into a formal
shape."
? *
So also the excellent and eloquent Scotch divine, who has
so lately passed away from us, Dr. Guthrie, in his auto-
biography just published, thus expresses his opinion of the
importance of the arts of elocution, and the importance he
attached to its acquisition :-
"I had, when a student in divinity, paid more than
ordinary attention to the art of elocution, knowing how
much of the effect produced on the audience depended on
the manner as well as the matter; that, in point of fact, the
manner is to the matter as the powder is to the ball. I had
attended elocution classes winter after winter, walking across
half the city and more, after eight o'clock at night, fair night
and foul, and not getting back to my lodgings till about
half-past ten. There I learned to find out and correct many
acquired and more or less awkward defects in gesture-to be,
in fact, natural; to acquire a command over my voice so as to
suit its force and emphasis to the sense, and to modulate it so
as to express the feelings, whether of surprise or grief, indigna-
tion, or pity. I had heard very indifferent discourses made
forcible by a vigorous, and able ones ones reduced to feebleness
by a poor, pithless delivery. I had read of the extraordinary
pains Demosthenes and Cicero took to cultivate their manner
and become masters of the arts of elocution; and I knew
how, by a masterly and natural use of these, Whitfield
could sway the crowds that gathered to hear him at early
morn on the commons of London, as a breeze does the stand-
ing corn, making men at his pleasure weep or laugh by the
way he pronounced' Mesopotamia.' Many have supposed that
I owe any power I have of modulating my voice, and giving
effect thereby to what I am delivering, to a musical ear.
On the contrary, I am, as they say in Scotland, timmer

tuned '-have not the vestige even of the musical faculty,
never knowing when people go off the tune but when they
stick!"
You will grant, I imagine, that the dramatic art, in its
highest forms and embodiments, is one of the fine arts. If
it is so, let me strengthen my position by the support given
to my argument by that well-known American divine, Dr.
Channing. In discussing the drama and dramatic amuse-
ments generally, he asks, "whether there is not a source of the
highest intellectual pleasure, having the closest possible
approximation to the drama, viz., recitation or reading
aloud? To hear a work of genius (he says) recited or read
by a man of fine taste, enthusiasm, and powers of elocution,
is a very high and pure gratification. Were this art only
more cultivated and encouraged amongst us, great numbers
of persons, now insensible to the most beautiful compositions,
might be awakened to their full excellence and power. It
is not easy to conceive a more effectual way of spreading a
refined taste through a community. Should this only be
established among us successfully, the result would be that
the power of recitation would be more extensively called
forth, and this would be a most valuable addition to our
social and domestic pleasures."
I might quote many other authorities, English as well as
American, but on this point I will content myself with but
one more, a name of high and well deserved reputation,
Professor John Hullah, of this college. Mr. Hullah has
recently published a most able little work "On the Cultiva-
tion of the Speaking Voice," which I would strongly recom-
mend to any one who wishes to see how closely allied to the
music of speech is the the music of song. Indeed, it would
be difficult to draw the exact line of demarcation-if indeed
there is one at all-between the music of elocution, as shown
in the pure vocal tone, the widely ranging and proper


## p. 21 (#25) ##############################################

21
inflections and modulations of the voice in the recitation of
some grand or beautiful poem, and the music of song, as
shown in the powerful and expressive recitative of a Santley or
Sims Reeves in an oratorio by Handel or Haydn. It would
be almost impossible, I think, to say where the music of the
one art ends and that of the other begins. All the terms
that are used in music are in general applicable to elocution.
Piano and forte, with their various degrees; crescendo, and
diminuendo, legato, sostenuto, and staccato; Time, andante,
and allegro, and their modifications, the marks of emphasis,
expression; and à piacere or ad libitum-all these are
terms of art which may be applied as fitly to elocution as to
song. But can we go beyond this? Can the music of
speech be noted, its inflections in the range which the voice
takes rising or falling in the musical scale be duly marked,
the duration of the vowel in the syllables of words or in
monosyllabic words rightly indicated; can all this be done by
external signs or technical marks of indication?
It can.
But to go further than this, can the music of speech, as
shown in elocution, be divided into bars-regular and
systematic bars-upon fixed and definite principles, as in the
music of song? It can, and here is the proof. There lies
before me on this table a book more than a century old, of
which I apprehend the majority in this room have never seen
the name or heard of the author. It is entitled "Prosodia
Rationalis," and the author is Joshua Steele. It is an old
book, a rare book, and a very learned book. As I open it
and shew these pages to you, I imagine that any one on
bestowing a mere cursory glance at them would think I was
showing him the score of some song composed a hundred
years ago. It is, indeed, a grand and solemn theme to
which these notes are set; and how I wish I could but hear
them once more rendered by the great artist, whose recital
of them thrilled all hearts at our great National Theatre in

1772; for this is Hamlet's famous soliloquy on death and
immortality as rendered (with some slight variations suggested
by the author of the work) by that greatest of actors of the
last century, David Garrick. Here you have all the technical
signs which indicate quantity, inflections, and modulation;
the poise which marks the bars, &c.; the very interpretation
of the great tragedian, noted from actual observation by
Mr. Steele, handed down to us, and rendered capable of
being perpetuated for the instruction of future generations.
Time warns me that I must not dwell further on this portion
of my argument. To those who wish to make fuller investi-
gation into the subject I would name particularly, in addition
to the authors to whom I have already referred, the great
American work written "On the Voice" by the celebrated
physician, Dr. Rush; the Abbé Thibont's work, entitled
"Action Oratoire ;" and the treatise by the late John
Thelwall "On English Rhythmus," based avowedly on
Joshua Steele's system, as developed in his "Prosodia
Rationalis."
But now in this place arises the question-is there need
for any such instruction in elocution? Do we really want
it at the present time? Let me, as an answer, give you a
passage which
you will find in a charming volume of short
essays published during the last year by that original thinker
and accomplished writer, Sir Arthur Helps, under the title
of "Brevia":-
"How few men can talk distinctly and clearly! With
how many persons, especially the young of this generation,
is their talk a something which combines a lisp, a mutter, a
mumble, and a moan! How many times in the course of
a conversation amongst English people do you not hear the
question- What did you say?' Then as to the reading-I
put it to this intelligent company. Do you know amongst
your numerous friends and acquaintances ten persons who


## p. 23 (#27) ##############################################

23
can read aloud really well? You are silent. Then, as to
public speaking-how few have attained to any proficiency
in this art, which, however, is not a very difficult art. It is
a thousand pities there are not more proficients in this art;
for if there were it would not have so exorbitant a value put
upon it, and men who are proficient in it would not occupy
so great a position in the State as they do now. The man
who can do a thing well is, unfortunately, often now the last
man who can speak about it in public well, or even talk
about it well."—Brevia, p. 145.
Sir Arthur Helps laments in these strong terms the preva-
lence of inaudible, indistinct, and expressionless reading and
speaking. But can we wonder at it when, as a part of our
regular education, it is so wholly neglected. I am aware
that during the last ten years the elocution of the English
language has been much more made a subject of study and
practice at private schools of repute, for both sexes, than was
formerly the case. But still, at the present moment, there is
no regular professorship founded or endowed for giving
instruction in the art at either of our great universities;
and (as far as I can speak from my own experience) the only
public educational institutions, where lectures or courses of
instruction have been given in the art of reading and speak-
ing our native tongue properly and effectively, are this
College, University College, Wellington College, the City of
London College, the Royal Naval School, the Polytechnic,
the Birkbeck, and the Quebec Institutions. As far as I know,
there is nothing of the kind at the present moment at Eton,
at Harrow, at Rugby, at Winchester, at Westminster, St.
Paul's, the Charterhouse, or Christ's Hospital. If I am wrong
in this statement most gladly shall I receive the information
that I am mistaken. Now, then, what are the results of this
neglect? I put the question, but, as before, I would prefer
that the answer should be given by another rather than


## p. 24 (#28) ##############################################

24
myself. Let it come then from the Rev. Francis Trench,
who, in a lecture delivered by him in London some time ago
on "Good and Bad Reading in Church, School, and Home,”
says:-
"I must confess I can recall nothing worse than ordinary
school reading and recitation (mark, I say ordinary, because I
am well aware that there are some exceptions), whether in
the institutions for the rich or for the poor in our land.
Many amongst us can remember very well the method in
which we ourselves said our scholastic lessons in our former
days. Whether any improvement in this method has of late
taken place, I am unable to say. I trust that it may be so;
but at the public school where I myself was, and one, too,
not inferior in repute to any in the land—I mean Harrow—
the utmost attainable speed in recitation was allowed, a false
key and monotonous delivery of the worst kind was never
corrected or rebuked, no attempt whatever was made to
render or to keep the utterance in harmony with the sense;
and bad habits of delivery were formed and allowed, in a
manner almost too strange for belief, and on which I can
only now look back with exceeding surprise. Nor do I
conceive that the system was in the least better at other
schools. I cannot let them escape. For should the Etonian,
the Winchester, Rugby, or Westminster man, or the repre-
sentative of any other public school, ask me what grounds I
have for such a statement, my answer to the challenge would
be, that at college I had full means and opportunity to judge
from the reading of the students there. They were gathered
from all schools of distinction; and to any one hearing them
it was evident enough that the general delivery at other
schools was by no means superior to that which was
allowed, and which prevailed at my own. A system this
not only most objectionable, and most injurious at the time
even to a just impression of the sense of the passage read,


## p. 25 (#29) ##############################################

25
but also so lasting in its evil consequences, that many never
are emancipated or escape from them. I say this advisedly;
and even those who do escape often only escape after many
years, and with no little difficulty. Hence, I believe,
originates much of the bad reading which we hear in public
worship. Hence, I believe, originates that monotonous
cadence and drawl, which is so adverse to the due expression
by the reader, and to the due comprehension by the hearer,
of any passage read. The ear may be lulled, but the mind
is not reached; at least, if reached, it is reached in spite of
the reader's bad tone and enunciation. And here I quote
the words of one who felt this evil very deeply, and laboured
very constantly for its removal, or, at least, its mitigation -
the Rev. C. Simeon. How often,' said he, are the prayers
of the Church spoiled, and good sermons rendered uninterest-
ing, by bad delivery on the part of ministers.'"
"
Mr. Trench then proceeds to show in detail how the same
lamentable neglect of the art of reading aloud prevails.
equally in private schools, from the highest to the lowest
class, and calls attention to the fact, that even at the time
when he was speaking, so glaring was the evil in our
national schools, that a circular letter, had been sent from
Her Majesty's Board of the Privy Council to the various
inspectors of schools, stating that "complaints have been
made to their lordships concerning the very small degree of
attention which reading (as part of elocution) receives in
elementary schools, and making it imperative to include an
exercise on the art of reading in the oral part of the next
Christmas examination at the training-schools.
Even now, as we have seen, there is no complaint more
general than the rarity of good readers, even in those
professions and in those ranks of society where better
things might have been expected. About twelve years
ago, in consequence of a notification on the part of

26
the late Bishop of Rochester, that a certificate of
competence as a reader would be required in the case
of candidates for ordination in his lordship's diocese,
a general awakening to the importance of the subject seemed
to take place among clergy and laity, and for several weeks
one could hardly take up a newspaper, from The Times
to the humblest provincial journal, without seeing leading
articles and letters on "Clerical Elocution."
But no adequate practical result of any substantial and
permanent nature followed from all these discussions. It
was an illustration of the old proverb, "Great cry, but little
wool." Complaints teemed on all sides, but there was little
done to remedy the complaint. Several of the bishops have,
I know, from that time advised young curates and candidates
for orders to take a regular course of instruction in the art of
public reading, from those whom they thought were compe-
tent, from natural qualifications, education, position and
experience, to teach that art. But beyond this nothing has
been done, and the evil is nearly, if not quite, as prominent
and widely spread as ever.
What a very able writer says, under the signature of
"Rhetor," in a letter to the editor of The English Church-
man, dated October 3, 1861, may be reproduced now with
as much truth as then. The laity (he says towards the close
of his letter) complain, and most justly, of the bad reading
inflicted on them Sunday after Sunday. But how can it be
otherwise while the present system lasts? Candidates for
the ministry have no proper instruction, either in the public
schools or universities. They enter on their professional
duties with provincialisms and cockneyisms uncorrected, and
read positively worse than many of their congregation.
The varieties of professional incapacity are endless; the
mutterer, who swallows all his final syllables; the drawler,
who wearies with his tediousness; the gabbler, who rushes


## p. 27 (#31) ##############################################

27
through the service at express speed; the preacher, who
mistakes prayers for sermons; the spouter, who mouths the
prayers with the most painful affectation. All these evils
are the necessary consequences of the inadequate estimate of
the end in view, and the means to be employed for its
attainment.
On the occasion of the distribution of Prizes to the
Students of the Evening Classes Departmant, a few years
ago, the present Archbishop of York, who occupied the chair
as President of the meeting, adverted at considerable length
to the Class for instruction in Public Reading and Speaking,
of which I have the honour to be the Lecturer. His Grace
said, "that in his opinion there was no subject of more
general importance than this. It was scarcely possible to
attend any Church or public assembly of any kind without
meeting with instances of defective articulation, inaudibility,
indistinctness of utterance, or other faults in delivery. In
place of clear, fluent enunciation, true expression and feeling,
we too often meet with instances in which the reading and
speaking are characterised by the absence of almost every
requisite that should mark a good delivery. He himself had
not seldom heard readers and speakers in which all the five
vowels were so untruly sounded, that it was really diffi-
cult to say which vowel was the one intended to be
uttered. There were also often strong provincialisms and
other faults in the intonation and pronunciation, which,
with care and attention, might often be speedily removed
under the instruction of an able and judicious teacher, but
which, while they existed, were most unpleasing to persons of
refined ear and cultivated taste. These various faults in
delivery which he had enumerated too often marred the
effect of our Church services, the reading of the Holy Scrip-
tures, and the delivery of Sermons. He, therefore, saw, with
great gratification, that in this department of King's


## p. 28 (#32) ##############################################

28
College there were lectures and instruction given in the
art of Public Reading, and attended by so large a class,
and that prizes also were awarded for excellence in elocu-
tion."
With regard to public speaking, which he saw was in the
syllabus coupled with instruction in public reading, his Grace
said, "that if, as he understood, was meant by this, the
actual practice in the art of discussion, of clothing thoughts
in clear and fluent language addressed to others, and so
acquiring ease and expression in delivery, as well as con-
fidence and self-possession, it was deserving of every
encouragement, and met with his warmest approval; for
few things were more painful to witness than the nervous-
ness, hesitation, and embarrassment of an untrained speaker,
who often had excellent matter for a speech, but knew not
how to deliver it, from want of training and practice. In
this country, and in this age, almost every great religious,
political, and social movement was effected by the agency of
public speaking, and the advantages of being well versed in
this art, as well as in that of public reading, were becoming
every day more apparent."
I cannot do better here than quote a very striking and
appropriate passage from Professor Seeley's essay on
"English in Schools," very recently published. He says:-
"The students being assumed able to read, the first thing
is to teach them to read well. By reading well, I do not
mean merely correctly, but distinctly and expressively. I mean,
in short, that they should be taught elocution. To this I
attach the greatest importance. It is more than a hundred
years since Bishop Berkeley propounded the question,
whether half the learning and talent of England were not
wholly lost because elocution was not taught in schools and
colleges. The same question might be repeated now; so
slow are we English people in taking a hint. But it is not


## p. 29 (#33) ##############################################

29
for its practical use only that I wish to see elocution intro-
duced into education; not so much to prevent English
people from swallowing their words, as they do now, to the
astonishment and dismay of foreigners who are trying to
learn our language; nor yet that those whose profession or
business in after life demands public speaking, or reading,
may be taught to speak and read with effect. It is mainly
because I think that by this means, more than any other,
may be evoked in the minds of the young a taste for poetry
and eloquence. This taste is really very universal: generally,
where it appears wanting, it is only dormant; and it is
dormant because no means have ever been taken to cultivate
the sense of rhythm, and to make the delightfulness of speech
understood."-Lectures and Essays by J. R. Seeley, M. A.,
Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge,
pp. 231-2.
Now let me consider another question. Have we in our
modern composite English language an instrument fitted for,
and worthy of, the application of all the elements of artistic
and refined elocution? Is it that harsh, rugged, and un-
musical tongue which some persons assert it to be? I
utterly deny that the modern English of good composition
is a harsh and rugged language when properly read or
spoken, unless words of harsh and rugged sound be intro-
duced purposely on the principle of concord between sound
and sense-a principle that is to be found more or less
apparent and developed in all languages with which I
have any sort of acquaintance. Why has the reproach of
being "harsh and rugged" so often been cast upon our
language by foreigners, as well as Englishmen, and a con-
trast, disadvantageous to us, been drawn between our tongue
and that of Italy or Spain, for example? I think I can give
a sufficient reason as an answer. The elements of all tone,
inflection, and modulation in human speech are obviously


## p. 30 (#34) ##############################################

30
and necessarily the vowels. Let any of us hear the average
educated Italian or Spaniard read or speak his own tongue
and we are struck at once with the beauty of the sound of
the language. Again I ask why? Probably the answer
will be "because Italian and Spanish abound in so many
fine, rich, open vowels," and, so far as it goes, the reason
given in such answer is true enough; but it is not the whole
reason. Observe a little more closely and you will find, as
a rule, generally that the Italian or the Spaniard forms the
vowels purely and sonorously, dwells upon them properly, so
that he has ample material for due inflection and modulation,
and thus his own pronunciation contributes largely to the
musical quality, richness, and beauty of the sound of the
language of which he is so justly proud. Now, then, in
contrast to this, note the ordinary delivery of the average
Englishman, who has had no acquaintance with the elements
of elocution, or with reading aloud, or public speaking, con-
sidered as an art, and I think you will find as a rule that the
lungs are but seldom inflated sufficiently, or the glottis
opened enough for the pure sound of the different vowels,
that they are but seldom duly dwelt upon and properly in-
flected and modulated, and very little use is made of the
many and complicated functions of the larynx; neither do
the articulating organs, such as the tongue, lips, &c., perform
their part in pronunciation with sufficient energy and pre-
cision of action. Hence that loose, muffled, and indistinct
delivery, which the Saturday Review, not so very long ago,
in a most excellent and amusing essay "On Voices," charac-
terised as "fluffy," and asserted that this "fluffiness” of
style was the special characteristic of the average English-
man's speech. Hence that unmusical and expressionless
"gabble," which so often pains and wearies our ears in the
reading desk, pulpit, and public meeting, and which has
brought down upon our glorious English tongue-that


## p. 31 (#35) ##############################################

31
tongue which the great German philoligist, Jacob Grimm,
asserts to possess "a veritable power of expression and com-
prehension unsurpassed by any language on earth, whether
ancient or modern "-the reproach of being "harsh and
rugged." No! I say again, most emphatically, the reproach
is not deserved. Our English language has not merely a
sufficiency of consonants to give it nerve, energy, and power,
but quite a sufficient recurrence of vowels, if justice is only
done to them, to give it full beauty and melody of sound in
pronunciation. I give this challenge-Let anyone hear a
fine passage from Shakespeare, Milton, or Tennyson, for
instance, read by an accomplished and refined reader, well
endowed with good natural gifts, and capable, by study and
practice in the art of elocution, of conveying all that the
poet would desire to the senses and feelings of his audience,
and then say, if he honestly can, that our English language
is wanting either in grandeur or beauty of sound.
So far, then, I have been considering this subject in the
light of a high and pure pleasure, which should be cultivated
by us for the sake of the gratification which it yields to
others, and as a great addition to our social enjoyments.
But I cannot conclude without adverting to it under a more
selfish aspect.
It seems to me one of the beneficent laws of
the Creator that all good is, in the language of our great
dramatist, "twice blest, blessing him that gives and him
that takes." So, too, as regards the art for which I appear as
advocate to-night. The vocal and speech organs cannot be
properly developed by a course of true elocutionary practice
without the whole system gaining wonderfully in physical
health and vigour. I might quote many high medical
authorities in support of this assertion, but I will content
myself with only citing one; for it is a name of one of the
highest authority on such subjects, you will admit, when I
tell you it is the name of that eminent physician and accom-

32
plished man who passed away from us but so recently, the
late Sir Henry Holland. In Sir Henry Holland's "Medical
Notes," at p. 422, I read as follows:-
"Might not more be done in practice towards the prevention
of pulmonary disease, as well as for the general improvement
of health by expressly exercising the organs of respiration-that
is by practising according to method those actions of the
body through which the chest is in part filled or emptied of
air? Though suggestions to this effect occur in some of our
best works on consumption, as well as in the writings of cer-
tain continental physicians, they have hitherto had less than
their due influence, and the principle as such is comparatively
little recognized, or brought into general application. In
truth, common usage takes for the most part a directly
opposite course; and, under the notion or pretext of quiet,
seeks to repress all direct exercise of this important function
in those who are presumed to have any tendency to pul-
monary disorders.
As regards the modes of exer-
cising the function of respiration, they should be various, to
suit the varying powers and exigencies of the patient.
Reading aloud (clara lectico) is one of very ancient recom-
mendation, the good effects of which are not limited to this
object alone. It might indeed be well were the practice of
distinct recitation, such as implies a certain effort of the
organs beyond that of mere ordinary speech, more generally
used in early life, and continued as a habit, or regular exer-
cise, but especially by those whose chests are weak, and who
cannot sustain stronger exertions. Even singing may for
the same reasons be allowed in many such cases, but within
much narrower limits, and under much more cautious notice
of the effects than would be requisite in reading. If such
caution be duly used as to posture, articulation, and the
avoidance of all excess, these regular exercises of the voice may
be rendered as salutary to the organs of respiration as they are


## p. 33 (#37) ##############################################

33
agreeable in their influence on the ordinary voice. The common
course of education is much at fault in this respect. If some
small part of the time given to crowding facts on the mind
not yet prepared to receive or retain them were employed
in fashioning and improving the organs of speech under
good tuition, and with suitable subjects for recitation, both
mind and body would often gain materially by the substitu-
tion."
I might quote opinions to precisely the same effect from
the works on consumption and other diseases of the respira-
tory organs, of Dr. James Bright., Dr. Godwin Timms,
Combe, Mayo, and other eminent physicians and physiolo-
gists, but there is no need to multiply quotations; suffice it
to say that all these high medical authorities concur in the
same opinion, viz., that "reading aloud" is, when conducted
on sound principles, an exercise for the delicate and for the
robust, as healthy and strengthening to the body as it is
pleasant and profitable to the mind.
Some time since a benevolent gentleman, aware of the
importance of good reading, and anxious to encourage the study
of the art, liberally made an offer to both our great Universi-
ties to found a prize of the annual value of £40 to be given to
the best reader. After, I believe, some hesitation, the offer
was accepted by Cambridge, and the results, I understand,
have been very encouraging. But, up to the present time,
Oxford has declined the proffered gift. I have no authority
to state the grounds of the rejection, but I have reason to
believe it was on account of the alleged difficulty of deciding
to whom, at the times of competition, the prize for good
reading should be awarded. Now I must confess to failing
to see the soundness of this objection, when we have had for
for so many years at King's College the establishment of
classes for cultivating the art of public reading, and of
annually awarding prizes for proficiency.
And certainly


## p. 34 (#38) ##############################################

34
here there has been very little, if any, difficulty in deciding
at the examination who was the student to whom such prize
should be awarded. On more than one occasion I believe
two students have been found equal in point of merit, and
then the council of King's College have generously given
two prizes. If such an occurrence happened at the Univer-
sity of Oxford, surely the prize of £40 might be divided
between the two competitors. I can only hope that in a
short time Oxford may be induced to reconsider her decision,
and follow the course taken by her sister University of Cam-
bridge.
But Time warns me that I must draw these introductory
remarks to a close. I have viewed the subject of elocution
under various aspects, and I have endeavoured to show why
it is well worthy of being studied for the sake of its good
results on others, and also for your own sakes personally.
And I trust I have said enough to prove that the hours you
will spend here in the study and practice of the art of
public reading and speaking will be hours neither wasted nor
misapplied.

PRESS NOTICES
ON MR. PLUMPTRE'S LAST EDITION OF "KING'S COLLEGE LECTURES
ON ELOCUTION."
In Indian Institutions we labour under difficulties in regard to pronunciation which
it is hard to combat. The native student enters upon the study of the English lan-
guage just as an Englishman would undertake the study of French or German: to both
the language is foreign. Under such circumstances the importance of the purest and
most effective mode of pronunciation cannot be overrated. But if it is difficult for
Indian students to learn the proper pronunciation of single words, it is still more diffi-
cult for them to learn how to pronounce those words when they are arranged into
sentences. And here immediately arises the necessity of encouraging instruction in
that art of which Mr. Plumptre is as complete a master as a teacher. In language as
simple as it is emphatic Mr. Plumptre proves beyond a doubt why elocution should be

studied by all persons of both sexes, and his arguments must be read to be appreciated.
It is a melancholy fact that, while in England there are not wanting masters of almost
every art and science, few are to be found, even in that abode of vigour and wisdom,
who can justly appreciate and effectually practise the noble art of expressing their
'thoughts in speech as vigorously as they can conceive and write them. We quite agree
with the learned author that perfect elocution owes much to talent and nature; but
we also concur in his opinion that, to acquire proficiency in the art, our natural capa-
cities require to be fostered by assiduous cultivation. Those who neglect the study on
the score that as a natural gift it cannot be acquired put forward, they forget, but a
lame excuse for their own indolence and apathy. As our readers will see, we have but
briefly glanced at the instructive work before us. On another occasion we hope to
lead our readers more deeply into the various subjects that Mr. Plumptre discusses; and
we do not hesitate to say that any one who wishes to gain an insight into the masterly
thoughts of the eloquent writer would be amply repaid by a perusal of Mr. Plumptre's
King's College Lectures on Elocution." Western Star" (India), Jan., 1871.
Mr. Plumptre has now for several years fulfilled with signal ability the duties
devolving upon him as the Lecturer upon Public Reading and Speaking at King's Col-
lege, London, in the Evening Classes Department. Happily he has afforded us, one
and all, the opportunity for judging of him, not merely by hearsay-of estimating him
not simply by the range or scope of his reputation. He has now given to the outer
public the means of weighing in the balance his various capabilities as an instructor in
elocution. He has, in the shape of a goodly volume of 200 pages octavo, presented to
every one who lists a series of fourteen of these famous King's College Lectures of his
on Elocution-fourteen subdivisions of a most instructive and comprehensive theme-
the substance of the Introductory Course of Lectures and Practical Instruction he has
now for some time past been annually delivering. The book is dedicated, by permission,
to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. It is followed by two very remarkable appendices-
one of them singularly instructive, the other very curiously interesting. So far as any
merely printed book on elocution could accomplish its object, this one by Mr. Plumptre
is entitled to our highest commendation. The eye, the face, the voice, the gesture, are
of course all wanting, but the argument throughout is so lucid in itself, while the illus-
trations of that argument are so animated and so singularly felicitous, that reading the
work attentively page by page and lecture by lecture is the next best thing to seeing
and hearing the gifted professor himself, when he is, in his own person, exemplifying
the manifold and ever-varying charms of the all-conquering art of the Rhetorician and
Elocutionist." Sun," March 5, 1870.
This, although not a law book, is a book for lawyers. Practical treatises on various
branches of the law may be essential to store the mind of the advocate with ideas, but
unless he has the power of expressing them in such a way as to command the attention
of the court, his learning will prove of but little avail. To a barrister the brains are
of but little use without the tongue, and even the tongue, however fluent, may fail to give
due expression to the ideas, unless the voice is properly regulated so as to pronounce
with both clearness and force the words that are uttered, and the gestures of the body
enforce what the language has attempted to impress. Many are the failures of those
who would otherwise have been successful advocates from want of attention to the

principles of elocution. Their matter has been excellent, but their manner has been so.
bad as entirely to destroy the effect that their address must otherwise have produced.
We would point to instances of the kind in Parliament, at the Bar, and in the Pulpit.
To all such persons the work before us will be found invaluable; and, indeed, there
are few, if any, whose duties require them to speak in public, who will fail to derive
advantage from its perusal. The subject is treated in a thoroughly practical manner,
and is fully investigated with care and judgment. Mr. Plumptre speaks with the
authority of a professor, and he appears to understand his subject entirely, and in all
its different branches. He is quite aware of all the difficulties to be encountered, and
is ready with advice how to meet them. His work evinces considerable research,
extensive classical and general knowledge, and is, moreover, full of interesting matter.
We commend it heartily alike to those who aspire to become orators in Parliament, to
"the Clergy, and to the Bar.-"Quarterly Law Review," May, 1870.
In these days, when Lectures and " Penny Readings" are patronized by the " upper
ten thousand," and Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Baronets, M.P.'s, and
Esquires take part in them, and when at public dinners no one is supposed to be
unaccustomed to public speaking," it is highly desirable that those who appear on
the platform, or who rise at public banquets, should be able to go through their parts
satisfactorily. To accomplish this there are only two ways, one, to take lessons in
elocution, the other, to read works published with a view of imparting as much
practical instruction as can possibly be imparted by precept, where practice cannot
be attained. Mr. C. J. Plumptre, Lecturer at King's College, London, has just
published a volume upon the Principles and Practice of Elocution, which will be
found to be of the highest value to every one who is called on, either constantly or
at intervals, to speak in public. As a teacher Mr. Plumptre is most skilful: he is a
master of his art, and those who cannot avail themselves of his services will do well
to study his treatise, which is lucid, sound, and practical. The "King's College
Lectures" of Mr. Plumptre have been honoured by the patronage of the Prince of
Wales, to whom the volume is by permission dedicated.—“ Court Journal," December,
11, 1869.

Mr. Plumptre will be known to most of our readers as a very scientific and
successful teacher of elocution; and in this volume he has put forth the substance
of the course of lectures that he delivers at King's College, with such alterations
and additions as may meet the wants of those who are unable to avail themselves
of oral instruction. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the advantage of obtaining
complete command of all the powers of the voice, or to point out how very much
a good manner of delivery may promote the success of a medical practitioner.
These considerations are obvious; and if they stood alone we should hardly have
thought the lectures within our province as reviewers. We find, however, that Mr.
Plumptre enters at length, and with much ability, into the curative treatment of
impediments of speech. We have perused this portion of the treatise with great
care, and have much pleasure in bearing testimony to its great merit. The views
advanced rest upon sound physiology, and the practice advocated is in complete
accordance with them. Mr. Plumptre states, and our experience enables us to
confirm his opinion, that all cases of stammering and stuttering are curable, if
only the patient will exercise a certain degree of care and perseverance. It is

common for medical practitioners to be consulted about such impediments; and
we feel sure that in Mr. Plumptre's lectures they will find not only much valuable
practical information, but also a basis of sound principles, upon which the
details of treatment may be founded. We recommend the book very warmly to
our readers." Lancet," February 12, 1870.
Professor Plumptre, who is so well known for his elocutionary powers, has just
published a volume of fourteen of his lectures on elocution, delivered some time
since at King's College, London. The book is a handsome volume of more than
200 pages, and is dedicated to the Prince of Wales. A more entertaining work
it would be difficult to find, and it is one which we cordially recommend to the
student of divinity, the barrister, and the debater; in a word, to all who desire
to cultivate the faculty of speech, and to be able to express their ideas with
clearness, force, and elegance." Irish Gazette," March 19, 1870.
Every one ought to cultivate the art of reading; for though, perhaps, persons
may not be required to speak in public, few people escape the task of reading
aloud for the benefit of their own family and friends. What a difference it makes
if this is done effectively, and how few are able to read with proper energy,
correctness, and variety! This is not a book to review, but to recommend to those
who are cultivated enough to appreciate the advantages of good reading and
speaking. It contains the best possible directions for the management and
modulation of the voice." Victoria Magazine," April, 1870.
Mr. Plumptre gives in his valuable work a series of practical suggestions which will
be most useful to the student, whether he may be preparing for the pulpit, the bar, or
the platform." Oxford University Herald," October, 1870.
These Introductory Lectures by Mr. Plumptre are most lucidly illustrative of the
principles and practice of that art of elocution of which he is himself, in both senses,
a master, particularly of elocution considered in reference to the learned professions
and to Parliament. Mr. Plumptre appears with admirable credentials before his
pupils at the University, and before all those who, either in Oxford or in London,
may aspire, under his able tuition, to prepare themselves by an elocution course for the
the Church, for the Bar, or for Parliament. He is himself a barrister, and is the
hon. secretary of the Public Reading Society of which Lord Brougham is the president.
As one of the most accomplished readers of that society, he has frequently had occa-
sion to signalize here, in the metropolis, his capabilities as an elocutionist-capabilities
naturally very considerable, but beyond that, by study and practice admirably cultivated.
'Sun," March 20.

This volume contains lectures, delivered by Mr. Plumptre, designed to impress upon
his audience the importance of acquiring the art of elocution. In that region his
remarks were properly directed to the clergy and the students for the Church; but
all that he said about the value, nay, the necessity for learning to speak and read, and
his contention that it was quite as much an art to be studied as singing, drawing,

or any other accomplishment, are equally applicable to our own profession. Certainly
a tolerable speaker is not quite so rare among the lawyers as a tolerable reader among
the clergy, but we must admit that good reading or speaking is still very rare in
either branch of the profession. Even barristers, whose express business it is to
speak, rarely deem it necessary to make a study of the art they are to practise every
day of their lives. The solicitors have more excuse for the neglect of it, for they are
not necessarily called on to speak; they may escape if they will, though they are
always looked to as the proper persons to sustain a discussion in a public meeting,
and a lawyer who cannot talk is not held in the same public estimation as one who
Our own opinion of the importance of making a study of the arts of reading
and speaking is best shown by our endeavour to assist those who may desire to attain
those accomplishments with such hints as experience and study have suggested. If
any doubt the utility of, or even the necessity for, this acquirement, let them read
Mr. Plumptre's little volume, and it will convince them.
We believe that a
great stimulus has been given to the subject in Oxford by these lectures, and their
wider diffusion will, we hope, produce equally good results, not only among the lawyers,
but among the general public." The Law Times," April 27.
can.
A lucid summary of a course of sound and practical lectures on elocution.
The glimpse of his system which they enable us to obtain gives us a very high idea
of Mr. Plumptre's skill and method as a teacher, and we heartily wish him success in
his zealous attempt to secure an adequate recognition of this important but most
universally neglected branch of a liberal education.—"Spectator," March 16.
Mr. Plumptre's lectures are here published in a condensed form, so as to impart as
much practical instruction as can be conveyed in a manner necessarily imperfect
We intend now to give an analysis of what is here advanced, not only
because the experiment is an important one in its probable results, but also because
of the valuable practical information which this little volume conveys.—" Clerical
Journal," April 9.
Mr. Plumptre's lectures are sound and practical, entering not only into the principles
but the practice of elocution; and they will be found to be of great value by the young
clergyman or barrister, and, indeed, by every educated gentlemen who is called on,
either constantly, or at intervals, to speak in public—and who is not? Mr. Plumptre
suggests the establishment of a professorship of elocution at Oxford, a step which
certainly seems to us a move in the right direction." The Oriental Budget," July.
The neglect of the art of public speaking has always been a just reproach to this
country, when, by the form of the government, every one has an equal chance
reaching the highest honours in the state. This crying neglect, it will be seen by the
title of the above work, the author has attempted to correct, and that by a series of
lectures, in which the subject is handled in all its branches, and in a most admirable
and perspicuous manner. Mr. Plumptre has literally left nothing to be desired, so
clearly and so ably has he conveyed his sentiments and opinions on this question. We
have great pleasure in rendering our unqualified praise both of the style and composi-
tion of this very useful work." The Era," August 4.

This treatise embodies the substance of a course of introductory lectures on the
principles and practice of elocution, delivered in Oxford during the Michaelmas term
of last year. The author is well and favourably known here, as well as in London,
where his efforts as a teacher of this most valuable art have been highly appreciated,
and attended with gratifying success. . Mr. Plumptre is evidently a master
of the art, and we strongly recommend his treatise to all to whom the subject upon
which it treats can be of the least service." Oxford University Herald," March 9.

Mr. Plumptre is thoroughly proficient in the elocutionary art, and his book will be

Having so recently expressed our opinion on the merits of Mr. Plumptre's lectures,
and on his abilities as an elocutionist, we need not do more on the present occasion
than cordially to recommend his book to the notice of our readers." Oxford
Journal," March 2.
We now turn to Mr. Plumptre's volume of Lectures, and although its main
object is to show the value and necessity of elocution, and to announce
that he
intends to devote some of his time both in London and Oxford to the instruction of
the clergy and others in this important but neglected branch of their education, the
following extracts will be read with interest, and will be found to be of of much use to
our readers." The English Churchman," September 12.
[From the "Institute and Lecturers' Gazette" for November, 1873.]
"THE CULTURE OF SPEECH."
Judging from the highly laudatory notices which have appeared in The Times, The
Daily News, and other leading organs of the press, on the opening address on "Elocu-
tion considered in reference to Public and Social Life," delivered at King's College,
London, on Tuesday night, October 7, by Mr. C. J. Plumptre, Lecturer on Public
Reading and Speaking, in the Evening Classes Department of King's College, greater
public attention has been drawn to the importance of the subject discussed than on any
former occasion when Mr. Plumptre has opened his classes at that great Institution
with his usual annual public lecture.
The Times of October 11, after some prefatory remarks on the Lecture, goes on to
say—“Mr. Plumptre enlarged upon the many uses of accurate and cultivated speech,
not only in the public advocacy of opinions and in the transaction of public business,
but also in domestic life, from which he proposed to banish the familiar but often
annoying forms of interrogation-"I beg your pardon," "What did you say?" &c.
and then explained that a knowledge and practice of the best methods of filling the
lungs and of exerting the vocal organs was not only conducive to the comfort of the
audience, but also to that of the speaker or reader himself, who might thus be enabled
to use the voice with great power and for considerable periods of time without appreciable
fatigue, and especially without that dryness of the tongue and throat which compel un-
skilled orators to seek frequent assistance from the conventional water-bottle. He sup-

ported his views and arguments by many quotations from writers and speakers of emi-
nence, among others from the Archbishop of York, who, in distributing prizes at King's
College, had laid much stress upon the importance of training in elocution, not only the
clergy, but their often afflicted congregations. Sir Arthur Helps was cited in support
of the value of the art as a branch of education, and Sir Henry Holland to show the
salutary effect of proper vocal exercise upon the lungs. The lecturer concluded a very
interesting discourse amid the hearty applause of his hearers."
The Daily News of October 10 gives a very full report of the same lecture, which
we give in extenso in another column.
66
The Lancet of October 18 has also an excellent article on the subjects of Mr.
Plumptre's lecture, but of course regards it almost entirely from the medical point of
view, and says if elocution were only cultivated by those who most need it Clergy-
man's sore-throat" would cease to exist; and laryngeal and bronchial affections
generally would be diminished if the vocal organs received early and adequate training.
The Greeks and Romans were much in advance of us as elocutionists. Contrast the
divine in the pulpit with the Roman orator as he is pictured in antique gems; the
square, precise, semi-animate bearing in the one case, with the easy sway of the person
in the other. Reading aloud (clara lectio) after meals was recommended as an aid to
digestion by the Roman physicians; and justly, for reading as they practised it meant
the dilation of the chest, the full, deep respiration, the rise and fall of the diaphragm,
the mental exhilaration which the vocal utterance of exalted ideas implies. The dry-
ness of the throat, the breakdown from huskiness, the undignified recourse to the
water-bottle, so common to our platforms, were unknown to them. We have still some
things to learn from antiquity, and the use of the voice, with its accompaniment of
appropriate gesture in public speaking, is one of them.
Even "Punch," in his issue of October 18, lends his efficient though humorous aid to
66 The Culture of Speech" in the following paragraph :-" Mr. Plumptre, the celebrated
Elocutionist, declares his desire to teach everybody to speak plainly and distinctly,
and so to banish from use the phrase "I beg your pardon" and "What did you
say?" He will do good service. Nobody has more right to mumble, so that one
has difficulty in hearing him, than he has to write badly, so that one has difficulty
in reading him. But Mr. Plumptre, as a man of the world, must know that, as
Falstaff says, there is such a malady as not marking. He must also know that
many carnally-wise people cause a speech to be repeated, that they may gain more
time to consider their answer. These nuisances cannot be cured even by Mr.
Plumptre's excellent teaching. As to the first, it may be noticed that a man
seldom fails to hear, when anybody he deems his superior, or from whom he is
trying to gain anything, is talking to him; and therefore his inattention on other
occasions is an insolence. As for the Fabian, he is to be baffled and disconcerted
by making your second speech utterly unlike your first, and thus "selling" him,
when his painful grin of discontent will pleasingly confess his dodge. We would
supplement Mr. Plumptre's endeavours with these suggestions, and we most heartily
wish him all success."
99
Certainly the extracts we have given above show that the culture of speech has
received an impetus from some of the leading organs of public opinion in the daily
and weekly press, greater than it has met with for a long time past; and we rejoice
to see that the subject of Elocution in Public and Social Life has met with the
attention it deserves.
