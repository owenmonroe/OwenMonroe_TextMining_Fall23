From THE SENATUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW.
COLLEGE, 9th December, 1864.
SIR,--The Senate, at their meeting yesterday, agreed to recognize attendance at your
Classes as qualifying Students of Divinity of this University to become competitors for
the Dowanhill Prizes, about to be instituted.
I remain, Sir, yours faithfully,
DUN. H. WEIR, Clerk of Senate
WALTER BAYNHAM, Esq,
From Professor NICHOL, Professor of English Language and Literature,
University of Glasgow.
THE COLLEGE, Glasgow, 16th December, 1864.
HAVING heard Mr. W. BAYNAAM read, I can confidently recommend him as a Teacher
of Elocution. His delivery is effective and graceful. He renders some of the most
subtle passages of our English Classics in a clear and unaffected style, which evinces a
scholarly appreciation of the authors he has studied, as well as a thorough knowledgo
of the rules of his art, and a full command of an excellent voice.
JOHN NICHOL.

PREFACE.
a
With respect to the position which the words of the Compiler of this
Treatise holds in relation to the Extracts which are to follow, it is con-
ceived that “only in such a world he fills up a place which may be better
supplied when he has made it empty:"_that the more room he leaves for
the language of others, the more gratifying it will be to the reader.
Briefly, then, he would introduce his book as one whose nature, end, and
aim may be recognized by its title: A New Hand-book of Elocution.
The Novelty to which it lays claim is confined chiefly to the selections,
most of which are now introduced into an Elocutionary Manual for the
first time. They have been chosen after due deliberation, assisted by
an experience gleaned from many years' acquaintance with the class-room
and public platform. They are presented therefore with the pleasing
confidence of knowing that they will not alone instruct and interest
the Private Student, but will be found correspondingly suggestive and
EFFECTIVE to the Professional Reader and Reciter.
The Work embraces whatever belongs to the domain of reading or
oratory. It sets out with TWELVE SIMPLE RULES, which are conceived to
be sufficient to enable any Tyro to read audibly, distinctly, and
with intelligence. Speaking from experience, the Compiler can affirm
that however useful certain Elocutionary Problems (with Phrases
no less Problematical) may have been and are to some, they have
never in one single instance helped him or any one of his pupils. In all
cases SIMPLICITY has been found to be the secret of success.
The pupil
should carefully avoid a slavish copy of the master, but he can no more
hope to attain to eminence without a Living Example, than a blind man
could hope correctly to imitate nature. Sight and sound are indispensable
to attain proficiency in the Art; and without an INSTRUCTOR who can
shew his disciples reasons for alteration of tone, and practically demon-
strate changes of gesture, the concentrated essence of all that has been
written on the Theory of Elocution is comparatively USELESS. With
regard to Rules, there are certain principles that can never fail to afford
help in respect to reading at sight; but when the scholar has attained to a
clear and vigorous delivery, with a just appreciation of the Meaning of the
respective pieces, the best rules will be found to have grown obsolete, and
as cumbersome as the iron frame-work is to the well-set limbs of an active
child.
Careful attention has been paid to selections of what are called
Elocutionary Extracts ;” and accordingly, in the DRAMATIC SCENES,

PREFACE.
SHAKESPERIAN SOLILOQUIES, and extracts from Paradise Lost, there
are ample subjects for exercise in the more graceful, elaborate and
impassioned style of ORATORY OF THE Past: but the transition apparent
in the tone, words, and manner of Modern Eloquence has rendered
it necessary to glean from the Field of more Recent AUTHORS ;
and a choice has been made of those Extracts best calculated
to cultivate à colloquial style of delivery, and impart an Elocution
that shall be as gracefully apparent in Drawing-Room conversation as
in declamation from Pulpit, Platform or Bar. For this purpose there
are introduced not merely the usual tripologies and dialogues, but the
Compiler has appended Scenes which, in more than one instance, embrace
seven or eight characters, and also a Debate containing eleven.
Weighing the fact that the book will be used principally by the YOUNG,
whatever has been thought dull, feeble, prolix, or common-place, has been
carefully excluded, and nothing is now offered which is not bound up
with that never failing charm-A STORY.
To YOUNG LADIES it is believed the New Hand-Book will be very
acceptable. Many complaints have not unreasonably been made at finding
that pieces adapted for the fairer sex have, from some unexplained causes,
been omitted in other Treatises. In the present Work pot a few have
been selected from those which appeal almost exclusively to the softer
sympathies and feminine interests. With the knowledge of the im-
portance of rivetting the attention of the VERY YOUNG, by keeping within
the limits of their comprehension, the latter portion is devoted almost
exclusively to Selections from those authors most adapted to Interest,
Amuse, and Instruct the tender intellect.
The embarrassment which must beset compilers will be perhaps appar.
ent in the present case. Some standard pieces which many Elocutionists
have been privileged to insert in Full, have here from their length and
other circumstances been compressed, and in some cases most reluc-
tantly altogether omitted. In expressing the obligations which he is
under to Messrs. Carlyle, Browning, C. Dickens, and other living
celebrities, as well as to the various Publishers, some apology is
offered for the liberties which it has been found necessary to take
in abridging, simplifying, and otherwise slightly altering the words of
their productions.

NEW
CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION.
ONE NICHE THE HIGHEST
TAE scene opens with a view of the great Natural Bridge
in Virginia. There are three or four lads standing in the
channel below, looking up with awe to that vast arch of
unhewn rocks. It is almost five hundred feet from where
they stand, up those perpendicular bulwarks of limestone to
the key of that vast arch, which appears to them only of the
size of a man's hand. The silence of death is rendered more
impressive by the little stream that falls from rock to rock
down the channel. The sun is darkened, and the boys have
uncovered their heads, as if standing in the presence-chamber
of the Majesty of the whole earth. At last this feeling begins
to wear away; they look around them: and find that others
have been there before them. They see the names of hundreds
cut in the limestone butments. A new feeling comes over
their young hearts, and their knives are in their hands in an
instant. “What man has done, man can do,” is their watch-
word, while they draw themselves up, and carve their name
a foot above those of a hundred full-grown men who have
been there before them.
They are all satisfied with this feat of physical exertion-
except one, whose example illustrates perfectly the forgotten
truth, that there is “no royal road to learning.” This
ambitious youth sees a name just above his reach-
which will be green in the memory of the world when those
of Alexander, Cæsar, and Buonaparte shall rot in oblivion.
It was the name of Washington. He had been there and left
his name, a foot above any of his predecessors. It was a
glorious thought to write his name side by side with that
great father of his country. He grasps his knife with a
firmer hand, and, clinging to a little jutting crag, he cuts
-a name

again into the limestone, about a foot above where he stands;
he then reaches up and cuts another for his hands. 'Tis a
dangerous adventure; but as he puts his feet and hands into
those gains, and draws himself up carefully to his full length,
he finds himself a foot above every name chronicled in that
mighty wall. While his companions are regarding him with
concern and admiration, he cuts his name in wide capitals,
large and deep into that flinty album. His knife is still in
his hand, and strength in his sinews, and a new-created
aspiration in his heart. Again he cuts another niche, and
again he carves his name in larger capitals. This is not
enough; heedless of the entreaties of his companions, he cuts
and climbs again. The gradations of his ascending scale grow
wider apart. He measures his length at every gain he cuts.
The voices of his friends grow weaker and weaker, till their
words are finally lost on his ear. He now for the first time
casts a look beneath him-had that glance lasted a moment,
that moment would have been his last. He clings with a
convulsive shudder to his little niche in the rock. An awful
abyss awaits his almost certain fall. He is faint with severe
exertion, and trembling from the sudden view of the dreadful
destruction to which he is exposed. His knife is worn half-
way to the haft. He can hear the voices, but not the words,
of his terror-stricken companions below. What a moment!
what a meagre chance to escape destruction! there is no re-
tracing his steps. It is impossible to put his hands into the
same niche with his feet and retain his slender hold a moment.
His companions instantly perceive this new and fearful dilem-
ma, and await his fall with emotions that “freeze their young
blood.” He is too high to ask for his father and mother,
his brothers and sisters, to come and witness or avert his de-
struction. But one of his companions anticipates his desire.
Swift as the wind, he bounds down the channel, and the
situation of the fated boy is told upon his father's hearth-
stone.
Minutes of almost eternal length roll on, and there are
hundreds standing in that rocky channel, and hundreds on the
bridge above, all holding their breath, and awaiting the fear-
ful catastrophe. The poor boy hears the hun of new and
numerous voices both above and below. He can just dis-
tinguish the tones of his father, who is shouting with all the
energy of despair:“ William! William! Don't look down!
Your mother, and Henry, and Harriet, are all here praying
for you! Don't look down! Keep your eye towards the top !"
The boy did'nt look down. His eye is fixed like a flint

towards Heaven, and his young heart on Him who reigns

and another foot is added to the hundreds that remove him
from the reach of human help from below. How carefully he
uses his wasted blade! How anxiously he selects the softest
places in that vast pier! How he avoids every flinty grain!
How he economizes his physical powers, resting a moment at
each gain he cuts! How every motion is watched from below!
There stands his father, mother, brother, and sister, on the
very spot, where if he falls he will not fall alone.
The sun is half-way down in the west. The lad has made
fifty additional niches in the mighty wall, and now finds him-
self directly under the middle of that vast arch of rock, earth,
and trees. He must cut his way in a new direction to get
from this overhanging mountain. The inspiration of hope is
in his bosom ; its vital heat is fed by the increasing shouts of
hundreds, perched upon cliffs and trees, and others who stand
with ropes in their hands upon the bridge above, or with
ladders below. Fifty more gains must be cut before the
longest rope can reach him. His wasting blade strikes
again into the limestone. The boy is emerging painfully
foot by foot from under that lofty arch. Spliced ropes are in
the bands of those who are leaning over the outer edge of the
bridge. Two minutes more and all will be over. That blade
is worn to the last half-inch. The boy's head reels; his eyes
are starting from their sockets. His last hope is dying in his
heart; his life must hang upon the next gain he cuts. That
niche is his last. At the last flint gash he makes, his knife-
his faithful knife-falls from his little nerveless hand, and
ringing along the precipice, falls at his mother's feet. An
involuntary groan of despair runs like a death-knell through
the channel below, and all is still as the grave. At the height
of nearly three hundred feet, the devoted boy lifts his hope-
less heart and closing eyes to commend his soul to God. 'Tis
but a moment—there! one foot swings off he is reeling-
trembling-toppling over into eternity. Hark !-a shout falls
on his ears from above! The man who is lying with half his
length over the bridge, has caught a glimpse of the boy's
head and shoulders. Quick as thought, the noose rope is
within reach of the sinking youth. No one breathes. With
a faint convulsive effort, the swooning boy drops his arm into
the noose.
Darkness comes over him, and with the words
“GOD!” and “MOTHER !” whispered on his lips just loud
enough to be heard in heaven, the tightening rope lifts bim
out of his last shallow niche. Not a lip moves while he is

HOW LADY BLANCHE ARUNDEL HELD
WARDOUR FOR KING CHARLES.
[By kind permission of CHARLES DICKENS, Esq.)
The first of May, the garland day, that ushers in the spring,
Saw Wardour Castle fair and strong in arms for Charles the
king;
The elms were black with noisy rooks, the meadows gilt with
flowers,
With rosary of blossoms, Time counts the dying hours.
The butler moved his casks about, the chaplain was at bowls,
The grooms were hissing in the stalls, the boys played with
the foals,
The Lady Blanche among her maids was busy as the best,
Unconscious that the carrion crow was hovering o'er her nest.
All suddenly a group of us upon an outer wall,
Was startled by a warning shout from those within the hall,
And through the wind-toss'd avenue, from out a storm of
dust,
Galloped a wounded serving-man, whose helmet was all rust.
One-two-then three, poor frightened knaves, with faces
gashed and torn,
One with a broken sword red-wet, who screamed upon a horn;
And then a rout of flying men groaning and very white,
Each swearing, as he hoped for grace, Cromwell would come
that night.
That night our scouts were pouring in, each paler than the
last,
The shepherds brought us news of Strode, and every troop
they'd passed ;
A moment Lady Blanche turned pale, but soon flushed angry
red,
To think Old England's golden crown should deck a brewer's
head.

LADY BLANCHE ARUNDEL.

All night the melting lead was poured into our bullet moulds,
The trusty pikes were lifted down from the long ratched-
holds,
Great stones were piled upon each ledge, the guns were duly
scoured,
Upon the highest tower, our flag of angry challenge lowered.
She never chid her serving maids about their tapestry;
And yet, of all that busy hive she was the fair Queen Bee.
For idleness, or ribaldry, or drunken revelling sport,
Dared never e'en to set a foot within the inner court.
Her husband and her lord was gone unto the tented field,
To wring from stone-faced Puritans what Puritans would
yield;
She was alone without a friend, yet never thought of fear,
For gathered in her castle-walls was food for seven year.
That sullen night, just at the dusk, from out those garden
trees
A muffled drum, with mournful throb, sounded upon the
breeze;
And dark and slow the Puritans began their leaguer then,
Not in the open manly way of honest gentlemen.
They burnt our stacks, they fired our barns, they harried us
all day;
At night they poured the hot shot in where we stood firm at
bay.
They scorched our walls, they blacken'd doors, they splinter'd
roof and pane,
But to the brave old trusty place no entrance could they gain.
One day a pale-faced trumpeter the rebel dogs sent in,
The gall and bile were oozing through his scurvy, sallow skin;
He bade us all surrender to this Cromwell, “England's lord:”
The women were to go in peace; the men-yield to the sword.
Then Lady Blanche tore up the roll, and trod it under foot;
We drove the crop-ear from the gate, with scoffing laugh and
hoot;
We crush'd his trumpet, snapp'd his staff, and set the dogs
at him:
Ha !—but for Lady Blanche's grace they'd torn him limb from
limb.

Their swords smote blunt upon our steel, and keen upon our
buff, .
The coldest-blooded man of us had battering enough;
'Twas butt and butt, and point and point, and eager pike to
pike,
'Twas foin and parry, give and take, as long as we could
strike.
There, in the breach stood Lady Blanche, a banner in her
hand,
Urging us on with voice and look to scourge this currish
band.
She stood amid the fire and flame in the red gap of wall,
An angel sent to comfort us—the bravest of us all.
The fire-balls vex'd us night and day; their mines shook down
a tower,
Their bullets upon door and roof fell in unpitying shower;
;
At last, on specious promises of mercy to us all,
Our Lady Blanche hung out a flag of white upon the wall.
They burnt our stables, stole our deer, caught all our fattest
carp;
They felled the old oaks in the park with axes keen and
sharp;
Unearth'd our leaden conduit-pipes and melted them in bars;
Tore our great pictures into strips, and split the floors in
stars.
This was the way the Rebel Dogs a sacred treaty kept,
Yet God had not forgotten us, nor had His justice slept;
For that day week Newcastle's "lambs” fell on this lying
rout,
Shot, piked, and sabred half the troop, and burnt the others
out.

With a great many more of lesser degree,--
In sooth a goodly company;
And they served the Lord Primate on bended knee.
Never,
I
ween,
Was a prouder seen,
Read of in books, or dreamt of in dreams,
Than the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of Rheims!
In and out
Through the motley rout
That little Jackdaw kept hopping about;
Here and there
Like a dog in a fair,
Over comfits and cates,
And dishes and plates,
Cowl and cope, and rocket and pall,
Mitre and crosier! he hopp'd upon all!
With saucy air,
He perch'd on the chair
Where, in state, the great Lord Cardinal sat
In the great Lord Cardinal's great red hat;
And he peer'd in the face
Of his Lordship's Grace,
With a satisfied look, as if he would say,
“We two are the greatest folks here to-day!”
And the priests, with awe,
As such freaks they saw,
Said, “ Whatever has come to that little Jackdaw !",
The feast was over, the board was clear'd,
The flawns and the custards had all disappear'd.
And six little singing-boys,--dear little souls !
In nice clean faces, and nice white stoles,
Came, in order due,
Two by two,
Marching that grand refectory through!
A nice little boy held a golden ewer,
Emboss'd, and fill'd with water as pure
As any that flows between Rheims and Namur,
Which a nice little boy stood ready to catch
In a fine golden hand-basin made to match.
Two nice little boys, rather more grown,
Carried lavender-water and eau-de-Cologne;
And a nice little boy had a nice cake of soap
Worthy of washing the hands of the Pope.

One little boy more
A napkin bore,
Of the best white diaper, fringed with pink,
And a Cardinal's Hat mark'd in “ permanent ink.”
The great Lord Cardinal turns at the sight
Of these nice little boys dress'd all in white:
From his finger he draws
His costly turquoise;
And, not thinking at all about little Jackdaws,
Deposits it straight
By the side of his plate,
While the nice little boys on his Eminence wait;
Till, when nobody's dreaming of any such thing,
That little Jackdaw hops off with the ring!
There's a cry and a shout,
And an awful rout,
And nobody seems to know what they're about,
But the monks have their pockets all turn’d inside out;
The friars are kneeling,
And hunting, and feeling
The carpet, the floor, and the walls, and the ceiling.
The Cardinal drew
Off each plum-colour'd shoe,
And left his red stockings exposed to the view;
He peeps, and he feels
In the toes and the heels;
They turn up the dishes,—they turn up the plates,-
They take up the poker and poke out the grates,
-They turn up the rugs,
They examine the mugs:-
But, no!--no such thing;
They can't find THE RING!
And the abbot declared that, “when nobody twigg'd it,
Some rascal or other bad popp'd in, and prigg'd it !”
The Cardinal rose with a dignified look,
He call’d for his candle, his bell, and his book!
In holy anger and pious grief,
He solemnly cursed that rascally thief !
He cursed him at board, he cursed him in bed;
From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head;
He cursed him in sleeping, that every night
He should dream of all evil, and wake in a fright;

He cursed him in eating, he cursed him in drinking,
He cursed him in coughing, in sneezing, in winking;
He cursed him in sitting, in standing, in lying ;
He cursed him in walking, in riding, in flying,
He cursed him living, he cursed him dying !
Never was heard such a terrible curse!
But what gave rise
To no little surprise,
Nobody seem'd one penny the worse !
The day was gone,
The night came on,
The monks and the friars they search'd till dawn;
When the sacristan saw,
On crumpled claw,
Come limping a poor little lame Jackdaw !
No longer gay,
As on yesterday;
His feathers all seem'd to be turn'd the wrong way ;-
His pinions droop'd—he could bardly stand,
His head was as bald as the palm of your hand;
His eye so dim,
So wasted each limb,
That, heedless of grammar, they all cried, “THAT'S HIM!
That's the scamp that has done this scandalous thing!
That's the thief that has got my Lord Cardinal's Ring!"
The poor little Jackdaw,
When the monks he saw,
Feebly gave vent to the ghost of a caw;
And turn’d his bald head, as much as to say,
“ Pray, be so good as to walk this way!”
Slower and slower
He limp'd on before,
Till they came to the back of the belfry door,
Where the first thing they saw,
'Midst the sticks and the straw,
Was the Ring in the nest of that little Jackdaw!
Then the great Lord Cardinal call’d for his book,
And off that terrible curse he took;
The mute expression
Served in lieu of confession,
And, being thus coupled with full restitution,
The Jackdaw got plenary absolution !

Was so changed in a moment, 'twas really absurd.
He grew sleek, and fat;
In addition to that,
A fresh crop of feathers came thick as a mat!
His tail waggled more
Even than before;
But no longer it wagg'd with an impudent air,
No longer he perch'd on the Cardinal's chair.
He hopp'd now about
With a gait devout;
At Matins, at Vespers, he never was out;
And, so far from any more pilfering deeds,
He always seem'd telling the Confessor's beads.
If any one lied,—or if any one swore,-
Or slumber'd in prayer-time and happen'd to snore,
That good Jackdaw
Would give a great “Caw!"
As much as to say, “ Don't do so any more !"
While many remark’d, as his manners they saw,
That they
had known such a pious Jackdaw!"
He long lived the pride
Of that country side,
And at last in the odour of sanctity died;
When his words were too faint
His merits to paint,
The Conclave determined to make him a Saint;
And on newly-made Saints and Popes, as you know,
It's the custom at Rome new names to bestow,
So they canonized him by the name of Jim Crow!

" THE MAN OF THE WORLD."
SIR PERTINAX. EGERTON.
Sir P. Charles, I have often told you, and now again I tell
you, once for aw, that the manæuvres of pliability are as
necessary to rise in the world as wrangling and logical
subtlety are to rise at the bar: why, you see, sir, I have
acquired a noble fortune, a princely fortune—and how do you
think I raised it?
Eger. Doubtless, sir, by your abilities.

Sir P. Doubtless, sir, you are a blockhead: nae, sir, I'll tell
you how I raised it:-sir, I raised it-by booing—[Bows very
low]—by booing: sir, I never could stand straight in the
presence of a great mon, but always booed, and booed, and
booed—as it were by instinct.
Eger. How do you mean by instinct, sir?
Sir P. How do I mean by instinct !—Why, sir, I mean by
-by-by the instinct of interest, sir, which is the universal
instinct of mankind. Sir, it is wonderful to think what a
cordial, what an amicable-nay, what an infallible influence
booing has upon the pride and vanity of human nature.
Charles, answer me sincerely, have you a mind to be convinced
of the force of my doctrine by example and demonstration?
Eger. Certainly, sir.
Sir P. Then, sir, as the greatest favour I can confer upon
you, I'll give you a short sketch of the stages of my booing,
as an excitement, and a landmark to boo by, and as an
infallible nostrum, for a man of the world to rise in the world.
Eger. Sir, I shall be proud to profit by your experience.
Sir P. Vary weel, sir; sit ye down then, sit you down here.
- [They sit]-And now, sir, you must recall to your thoughts,
that your grandfather was a man whose penurious income of
captain's half-pay was the sum total of his fortune; and, sir,
aw my provision fra him was a modicum of Latin, an expert-
ness in arithmetic, and a short system of worldly counsel; the
principal ingredients of which were, a persevering industry, a
rigid economy, a smooth tongue, a pliability of temper, and a
constant attention to make every mon well ple
sed with
himself.
Eger. Very prudent advice, sir.
Sir P. Therefore, sir, I lay it before you. Now, sir, with
these materials I set out, a raw.boned stripling fra the North,
to try my fortune with them here, in the Sooth; and my first
step in the world was a beggarly clerkship in Sawney Gordon's
counting house, here in the city of London, which you 'll say
afforded but a barren sort of prospect.
Eger. It was not a very fertile one indeed, sir.
Sir P. The reverse, the reverse. Weel, sir, seeing myself
in this unprofitable situation, I reflected deeply; I cast about
my thoughts morning, noon, and night; and marked every
man and every mode of prosperity; at last I concluded that a
matrimonial adventure, prudently conducted, would be the
readiest gait I could gang for the bettering of my condition,
and accordingly I set aboot it. Now, sir, in this pursuit,
beauty ah! beauty often struck my een, and played about

my heart; and fluttered, and beat, and knocked, and knocked;
but the devil an entrance I ever let it get: for I observed,
sir, that beauty is, generally, a--proud, vain, saucy, expensive,
impertinent sort of a commodity.
Eger. Very justly observed.
Sir P. And therefore, sir, I left it for prodigals and cox-
combs, that could afford to pay for it; and, in its stead, sir,
mark! I looked out for an ancient, weel-jointured, super-
annuated dowager; a comsumptive, toothless, phythisicky,
wealthy widow; or a shrivelled, cadaverous piece of deformity,
in the shape of an izzard, or an appersi-and-or, in short, ainy
thing, ainy thing that had the siller--the siller-for that, sir,
was the north-star of my affections. Do you take me, sir?
was nae that right?
Eger. O doubtless, doubtless, sir.
Sir P. Now, sir, where do you think I ganged to look for
this woman with the siller?—nae till court, nae till playhouses
or assemblies—nae, sir, I ganged till the kirk, till the Ana-
baptist, Independent, Bradlonian, and Muggletonian meetings;
till the morning and evening service of churches and chapels
of ease, and till the midnight, melting, conciliating love-feasts
of the Methodists; and there, sir, at last I fell upon an old,
slighted, antiquated, musty maiden, that looked-ha, ha, ha!
she looked just like a skeleton in a surgeon's glass case.
Now,
sir, this miserable object was religiously angry with herself
and all the world; had nae comfort but in metaphysical
visions and supernatural deliriums—ha, ha, ha! Sir, she was
as mad—as mad as a Bedlamite.
Eger. Not improbable, sir: there are numbers of poor
creatures in the same condition.
Sir P. Oh, numbers, numbers. Now, sir, this cracked
creature used to pray, and sing, and sigh, and groan,
and
weep,
and wail, and gnash her teeth, constantly, morning and even-
ing, at the Tabernacle at Moorfields; and, as soon I found
she had the siller, aha! guid traith, I plumped me down upon
Ι
my knees, close by her-cheek by jowl-and prayed, and
sighed, and sung, and groaned, and gnashed my teeth as
vehemently as she could do for the life of her; ay, and turned
up the whites of mine een, till the strings awmost cracked
again. I watched her motions, handed her till her chair,
waited on her home, got most religiously intimate with her in
a week—married her in a fortnight-buried her in a month;-
.touched the siller, and with a deep suit of mourning, a melan-
choly port, a sorrowful visage, and a joyful heart, I began the
world again; and this, sir, was the first boo—that is, the first

THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.
THE sleep of the fugitives lasted for several hours. The
trapper was the first to shake off its influence, as he had been
the last to court its refreshment. Rising, just as the gray
light of day began to brighten that portion of the studded
vault which rested on the eastern margin of the plain, he sum-
moned his companions from their warm lairs, and pointed
out the necessity of their being once more on the alert.
See, Middleton !” exclaimed Inez, in a sudden burst of
youthful pleasure, that caused her for a moment to forget
her situation, “ how lovely is that sky! surely it contains a
promise of happier times!”
“ It is glorious !” returned her husband. " Glorious and
heavenly is that streak of vivid red; and here is a still
brighter crimson. Rarely have I seen a richer rising of the
sun.'
“Rising of the sun!" slowly repeated the old man, lifting
his tall
person
from its seat with a deliberate and abstracted
air, while he kept his eye riveted on the changing and
certainly beautiful tints that were garnishing the vault of
heaven. “Rising of the sun!—I like not such risings of the
-Ah's me! the Indians have circumvented us. THE
PRAIRIE IS ON FIRE!"
“Oh, dreadful!” cried Middleton, catching Inez to his
bosom, under the instant impression of the imminence of their
danger. “ There is no time to lose, old man; each instant is
a day. Let us fly!”
“Whither?" demanded the trapper, motioning him, with

calmness and dignity, to arrest his steps. “In this wilder-
ness of grass and reeds, we are like a vessel in the broad
lakes without a compass. A single step on the wrong course
might prove the destruction of us all. It is seldom danger is
so pressing that there is not time enough for reason to do its
work, young officer; therefore, let us await its biddings."
“For my part,” said Paul Hover, looking about him with
an unequivocal expression of concern, “I acknowledge, that
should this dry bed of weeds get fairly in a flame, a bee would
have to make a flight higher than common to prevent his
wings from being scorched. Therefore, old trapper, I agree
I
with the captain, and say, Mount and Run!"
“ Ye are wrong-ye are wrong ;-man is not a beast, to
follow the gift of instinct, and to snuff up his knowledge by a
taint in the air or a rumbling in the ground; but he must see,
and reason, and then conclude. So, follow me a little to the
left, where there is a rising in the ground whence we may
make our reconnoitrings.”
The old man waved his hand with authority, and led the
way, without further parlance, to the spot he had indicated ;
followed by the whole of his alarmed companions. An eye
less practised than that of the trapper might have failed in
discovering the gentle elevation to which he alluded; and
which looked on the surface of the meadow like a growth a
little taller than common.
When they reached the place, however, the stunted grass
itself announced the absence of that moisture which had fed
the rank weeds of most of the plain, and furnished a elue to
the evidence by which he had judged of the formation of the
ground hidden beneath. Here a few minutes were lost in
breaking down the tops of the surrounding herbage—which,
notwithstanding the advantage of their position, rose even
above the heads of Middleton and Paul-and in obtaining a
look-out that might command a view of the surrounding sea
of fire.
The examination which his companions so instantly and so
intently made, rather served to assure them of their desperate
situation than to appease their fears. Huge columns of smoke
were rolling up from the plain, and thickening in gloomy
masses around the horizon. The red glow which gleamed
upon the enormous folds, now lighting the volumes with the
glare of the conflagration, now flashed to another point, as the
flame beneath glided ahead, leaving all behind enveloped in
awful darkness, and proclaiming louder than words the char-
acter of the imminent and rapidly approaching danger.

THE PRAIRIE ON FIRE.

The naturalist stood, tablets in hand, looking at the awful
spectacle with as much composure as though the conflagration
had been lighted in order to solve the difficulties of some
scientific problem. Aroused by the question of his companion,
he turned to his equally calm though differently occupied
associate—the trapper: demanding, with the most provoking
insensibility to the urgent nature of their situation=“ Vener-
able hunter, you have often witnessed similar prismatic
experiments-
" It is time to be doing," cried Middleton; “ the flames are
within a quarter of a mile of us, and the wind is bringing
them down in this direction with dreadful rapidity.”
- Anan! the flames! I care but little for the flames! If I
only knew how to circumvent the cunning of the Tetons as I
know how to cheat the fire of its prey, there would be
nothing needed but thanks to the Lord for our deliverance.
Do you call this a · FIRE'? If you had seen what I have wit-
nessed in the eastern hills; when mighty mountains were like
the furnace of a smith, you would have known what it was to
fear the flames, and to be thankful that you were spared.
Come, lads, come; 'tis time to be doing now, and to cease
talking, for yonder curling flame is truly coming on like a
trotting moose. Put hands upon this short and withered
grass where we stand, and lay bare the 'arth.”
The subtle element seized with avidity upon its new feul,
and in a moment, forked flames were gliding among
the grass,
as the tongues of ruminating animals are seen rolling among
their food, apparently in quest of its sweetest portions.
Now,” said the old man, holding up a finger, and laughing
in his peculiarly silent manner, "you shall see fire fight fire.
Ah's me!
many is the time I have burned a path from wanton
laziness to pick my way across a tangled bottom.”
“But this is not fatal?” cried the amazed Middleton;
you not bringing the enemy nigher to us, instead of avoiding
it?”
“Do you scorch so easily? Your grandfather bad a tougher
skin. But we shall live to see,—we shall all live to see.
The experience of the trapper was in the right. As the fire
gained strength and heat, it began to spread on three sides,
dying of itself on the fourth for want of aliment. As it
increased, and the sullen roaring announced its power, it
cleared everything before it, leaving the black and smoking
soil far more naked than if the scythe had swept the place.
The situation of the fugitives would still have been hazardous,
had not the area enlarged as the flame encircled them. But,

by advancing to the spot where the trapper had kindled the
grass, they avoided the heat; and in a very few moments the
flames began to recede in every direction, leaving them
enveloped in a cloud of smoke, but perfectly safe from the
torrent of fire that was still furiously rolling onward.
“ Most wonderful!” said Middleton, when he saw the com-
plete success of the means by which they had been rescued
from a danger that he had conceived to be unavoidable. “The
thought was a gift from Heaven.”
“Old trapper,” cried Paul, thrusting his fingers through
his shaggy locks, “I have lined many a loaded bee into his
hole, and know something of the nature of the woods; but
this is robbing a hornet of his sting without touching the
insect!”
“ It will do-it will do,” returned the old man, who, after
the first moment of his success, seemed to think no more of
the exploit. “Let the flames do their work for a short half
hour, and then we will mount. That time is needed to cool
the meadow; for these unshod beasts are tender on the hoof
as a barefooted girl.”
The veteran, on whose experience they all so implicitly
relied for protection, employed himself in reconnoitring objects
in the distance, through the openings which the air occasion-
ally made in the immense bodies of smoke, that by this time
lay in enormous piles on every part of the plain.–J. Fenimore
Cooper.
LADY MABEL'S LOVERS.
[By kind permission of CHARLES DICKENS, Esq.]
MOUNT PLEASANT'S wide-spread terraces were tadiant in the
sun,
The flowers their dewdrop coronets were wearing every one,
Uncrown'd, yet with a royal train, did Lady Mabel pace, ,
The gentle morning sunshine shone softly on her face.
The sunny porch bore “1500,” carved in letters long and
quaint,
The chapel had its western windows guarded by many a saint,
From the gatehouse spread the gardens, girt by marble
statues round,
Wbere the yew-tree's sable hedges, by rich belts of flowers
were bound.

LADY MABEL'S LOVERS.
19
Half a dozen silken suitors followed pretty Lady Mabel,
Smirking, simpering, bowing, prating, past each oriel and gable,
Waving plumes and fluttering satins--one alone, now three,
then two,
They paced the lozenge-paven terrace, by the close-clipp'd
walls of yew.
One was fixing firm his feather, with a shrill uneasy laugh,
One his scented glove was pulling, or was tying up his scarf;
One was stooping, gay adjusting fluttering ribbons on his knee,
Or was merry, disentangling chains and badges two or three.
One proposed full cups of clary; one cried out to “boot and
horse;'
The lawyer he was recommending "no eviction, if by force;"
The fop was picking clove carnations for the Lady Mabel's
hair,
Vowing by “Sir Phæbus' chariot” that she was excelling
fair.”
Far behind them, lone and musing, sober-garb'd and very sad,
Paced a poet-student, sunken-cheek'd and thin; the lad
By his mistress was unnoticed, by the pages held at scorn:
He stood
upon that terrace walk the unhappiest creature born.
Careless the lady paced along, her train borne up by twice
three pages;
The falcon on her little wrist fretted in pretty wanton rages.
One cord of pearls alone she wore, twisted around her hair;
Whene'er she moved, a breath of spring filled all the amorous
air.
Suddenly beside a fountain; on her lovers Mabel turn'd,
A maiden blush was on her cheek, her eyes with anger burn'd.
“ Villain suitors !” cried the lady, eating up my poor estate;
I, Penelope unguarded, still for a deliverer wait.
a
“Is there no one really loves me? none to free me from
these knaves?
From their insolence release me-none to chase away these
slaves ?
Smell-feasts, who with churlish clamour, seek
defence
less hand,
Only that they may the sooner gnaw into my gold and land?

Silent stood that flock of suitors, not one sought to lead the
rest;
But each one, sullen, flung his cloak athwart his craven breast,
Then stepped the gentle student-boy before those recreant men,
And drew his sword, and cried aloud, “BACK EACH ONE TO
HIS DEN!”
Then
every
face
grew
black to hear that bitterness of speech,
From every gilded sheath flash'd out the angry sword of each:
“Let's whip this bookworm, poor and hungry, to his scurvy
garret lair,
To read his Ovid's wanton songs, and pine and scribble there."
Then as a traveller would turn to brush the gnats away,
The lover strode, his eyes flash'd red, as royal stag at bay;
He would not draw his sword for fear to fright the lady fair,
But leapt and seized the foremost man, his strong hand in his
hair.
From one he tore his feather'd hat, from one he reut his cloak,
Though blood ran out and daubed his face, still fell his angry
stroke.
A wild bull goring could not drive with more impetuous horn
Than he, the stripling so despised, when he arose in scorn.
They fled,—the cowards ! every one,—with gems the walks
were strewn:
Here lay a broach of Indian pearl, and there an emerald
stone;
They threw their swords away and fled, -each pale as parted
corse,
They did not stay to rest or eat, but took at once to horse.
A moment pale and motionless the poet stood—nor spoke-
Look'd with fix'd eyes as in a trance-neither the silence
broke.
He spurned the jewels with his foot, then knelt to kiss her
hand-
He the poor vagrant London poet, and she the lady of the
land.
Humbly Mabel turned to thank him, with an almost tearful
smile,
Looking at his breast and forehead, lest some wound should
bleed the while.

THE LITTLE VULGAR BOY.

Low he bow'd, and was departing, picking up a broken sword,
Fearing ambush from the vengeance of some bruised and
beaten lord.

“Edward,” said she, soft and gently, as a whisper in a dream:
Like a prophet's revelation then upon him burst love's beam.
He turn'd, and kiss'd her lips and forehead, and one long
wind driven tress,
Then whisper'd, and a soft low murmur, scarcely syllabled,
said, “YES.”
-All the Year Round.
THE LITTLE VULGAR BOY.
.
'Twas in Margate last July, I walk'd upon the pier,
I saw a little vulgar Boy-I said, “ What makes you
here?
The gloom upon your youthful cheek speaks anything but joy;"
Again I said, “What makes you here, you little vulgar Boy?'
He frowned, that little vulgar Boy-he deem'd I meant to
scoff-
And when the little heart is big, a little “sets it off;"
He put his finger in his mouth, his little bosom rose-
He had no little handkerchief to wipe his little nose.

“Hark! ,don't you hear, my little man kit's striking Nine,"
I said,
“ An hour when all good little boys and girls should be in
bed.
Run home and get your supper, else your Ma' will scold-
Oh! fie!
It's very wrong indeed for little boys to stand and cry!"
The tear-drop in his little eye again began to spring,
His bosom tħrobb'd with agony—he cried like anything!
I stoop'd,—and thus amidst his sobs I heard him murmur-
“ Ah!
I haven't got no supper! and I haven't got no Ma!!
“My father he is on the seas--my mother's dead and gone!
And I am here, on this here pier, to roam the world alone;
I have not had, this live-long day, one drop to cheer my heart,
No 'brown' to buy a bit of bread with--let alone a tart.

“If there's a soul will give me food, or find me in employ.
By day or night, as I'm a sight:"(he was a vulgar Boy;)
“ And now I'm here, from this here pier it is my fixed intent
To jump, as Mister Levi did, from of the monument!”

“Cheer up! cheer up! my little man-cheer up!" I kindly said,
“You are a naughty boy to take such things into your head:

My landlady is Mrs. Jones—we must'nt keep her up-
There's roast potatoes at the fire-enough for me and you-
Come home, you little vulgar Boy-I lodge at Number 2."
I took him home to Number 2, the house beside “The Foy,"
I bade him wipe his dirty shoes—that little vulgar Boy-
And then I said to Mistress Jones, the kindest of her sex,
Pray be so good as go and fetch a pint of double X!"
But Mrs. Jones was rather cross, she made a little noise,
She said she “ did not like to wait on little vulgar boys."
She with her apron wiped the plates, and, as she rubb’d the
delf,
Said I might “go to Jericho, and fetch my beer myself!"

I did not go to Jericho-I went to get the beer,
I changed a shilling—but that's neither there nor here!
It was not so much for myself as for that vulgar child
And I said “A pint of double X, and please to draw it
mild !”.
When I came back I gazed about—I gazed on stool and
chair
I could not see my litttle friend—because he was not there!
I peep'd beneath the table-cloth-beneath the sofa toom
I said, “ You little vulgar Boy! why what's become of you?"
I could not see my table-spoons- I look’d, but could not see
The little fiddle-pattern'd ones I use when I'm at tea;
I could not see my sugar-tongs-my silver watch-oh, dear!
I know. 'twas on the mantel-piece when I went out for beer.

A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch

I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury; and am armed
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The

Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse, more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty:
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Shy. I have possessed your grace of what I purpose.
And by our holy sabbath have I sworn,
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter, and your city's freedom.
You 'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that
But
say
it is
my
humour: Is it answered ?
What if
my
house be troubled with a rat,
And I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats
To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet?--
Some men there are love not a gaping pig
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
Now, for your answer.
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig:
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate, and a certain loathing,
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
Bass. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
Shy. I am not bound to please thee with my answer,
Bass. Do all men kill the things they no not love?
Shy. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Bass. Every offence is not a hate at first.
Shy. What, would'st thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?
Ant. I pray you, think: you question with the Jew.
You may as well stand upon
the beach,
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf,
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise,
When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that (than which what's harder?)

Make no further offers, use no further means,

But, with all brief and plain conveniency,
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
Bass. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
Shy. If every ducat in six thousand ducats,
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them,-I would have my bond.
Duke. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
Shy. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them:-Shall I
say
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, and let
their palates
Be seasoned with such viands? You will answer,
The slaves are ours !-So do I answer you.
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine, and I will have it:
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice:
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
Duke. Upon my power, I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.
Solan.
My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.
Duke. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
Bass. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man! courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
Ant. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me:
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.
Gra.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
Shy. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

And for thy life let justice be accused;
Thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith,

Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
Shy. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud :
Repair thy wit, good youth; or it will fall
To cureless ruin.--I stand here for law.

Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you, as you do proceed-
You stand within this danger, do you not?
Ant. Ay, so he says.
Por.
Do
you
confess the bond ?
Ant. I do.
Por.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
Shy. On what compulsion must I ? tell me that.
Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes;
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shews the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,
It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then shew likest God's

When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this
That in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do
pray
for
mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much,
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
Shy. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my
bond.
Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?
Bass. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, thrice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I'll be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right do a little wrong;
And curb this cruel demon of his will.
Por. It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent;
And many an error, by the same example,
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ?
No, not for Venice.

Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart;Be merciful;
Take thrice thy money: bid me tear the bond.
Shy. When it is paid according to the tenor.

You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

The flesh ?

I have them ready.
Por. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he should bleed to death.

'Twere good you do so much for charity.

Ant. But little; I am arm'd, and well prepared.--
Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you
well !
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein fortune shews herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use,
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow,
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Por. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine ;
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

Por. Tarry a little ;-there is something else,
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are a pound of flesh;
Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;

One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods

If it be proved against an alien,

He seek the life of any citizen,

Therefore, thou must be hanged at the state's charge.
Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive into a fine.
Por. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that:
You take my house, when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take
When
you do take the means whereby I live.
Por. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
Gra. A halter gratis; nothing else, I pray you.
Ant. So please my lord the duke, and all the court,
To quit the fine for one half of his goods;
I am content, so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter;
Two things provided more,--that for this favour,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift
Here in the court, of all he dies possessed
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
Duke. He shall do this: or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.

ON EDUCATION.
Of all the blessings which it has pleased providence to allow
us to cultivate, there is not one that breathes a purer fra-
grance, or bears a heavenlier aspect, than education. It is
a companion which no misfortune can depress, no clime
destroy, no enemy alienate, no despotism enslave: at home a
friend, abroad an introduction, in solitude a solace, in society
an ornament: it chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at
.once a grace and government to genius. Without it, what
is man? A splendid slave! a reasoning savage, vacillating
between the dignity of an intelligence derived from God,
and the degradation of passions participated with brutes;
and, in the accident of their alternate ascendancy, shuddering
at the terrors of a hereafter, or embracing the horrid hope of
annihilation.
What is this wondrous world of his residence?
“A mighty maze, and all without a plan:”
a dark, and desolate, and dreary cavern, without wealth, or
ornament, or order. But light up within it the torch of
knowledge, and how wondrous the transition! The seasons
change, the atmosphere breathes, the landscape lives, earth
unfolds its fruits, ocean rolls in its magnificence, the heavens
display their constellated canopy, and the grand animated
spectacle of nature rises revealed before him, its varieties
regulated, and its mysteries resolved! The phenomena which
bewilder, the prejudices which debase, the superstitions which
enslave, vanish before education.
Like the holy symbol which blazed upon the cloud before
the hesitating Constantine, if man follow but its precepts,
purely, it will not only lead him to the victories of this world,
but open the very portals of Omnipotence for his admission.

once studded with the stars of empire and the splendours of
philosophy. What erected the little state of Athens into a
powerful commonwealth, placing in her hand the sceptre of
legislation, and wreathing round her brow the imperishable
chaplet of literary fame? What extended Rome, the haunt
of banditti, into universal empire? What animated Sparta
with that high, unbending, adamantine courage, which con-
quered nature herself, and has fixed her in the sight of future
ages, a model of public virtue, and a proverb of national
independence? What but those wise public institutions
which strengthened their minds with early application, in-
formed their infancy with the principles of action, and sent
them into the world, too vigilant to be deceived by its calms,
and too vigorous to be shaken by its whirlwinds?– Phillips.
THE OLD STATUE.
I.
In the market-place of Ypres, three hundred years ago,
A crumbling statue, old and rent by many a lightning blow,
Stood-sad and stern, and grim and blank, upon its mossy base,
The woes of many centuries were frozen in its face.
It was a Cæsar some men said, and some said Charlemagne,
Yet no one knew when he it aped, began, or ceased to reign,
Nor who it was, or what it was could any rightly say,
For the date upon its pedestal was fretted quite away.
When blue and ghastly moonshine fell, severing the shadows
dark,
And stars above were shining out with many a diamond spark,
It used to cast its gian't shade across the market square,
And through the darkness and the shine it fixed its stony stare.
'Twas said that where its shadow fell on a certain day and year,
An hour at least past midnight when the moon was up and
clear,
Near to that statue's mouldy base, deep hid beneath the
ground,
A treasure vast, of royal wealth, was certain to be found.
Slow round, as round a dial-plate, its sharp dark shadow
passed,
On fountain and cathedral roof, by turns, eclipse it cast;

Before it fled the pale blue light, chased as man's life by Death,
And deep you heard the great clock tick, like a sleeping giant's
breath.
II.
In that same market-place there lived an alchemist of fame,
A lean and yellow dark-eyed man, Hans Memling was his
name,
In scarlet hood and blood-red robe, in crimson vest and gown,
For twenty years, the moonlight through, he'd sat and watch'd
the town.
Like one flame lit he used to peer between the mullions there,
As yonder stars shot blessed light through the clear mid-
night air;
When chess-board, chequer'd black and white, part silver and
part jet,
The city lay in light and shade, barr'd with the moonbeam's net.
When gable-ends and pinnacles, and twisted chimney-stalks,
Rose thick around the market square, and its old cloister'd
walks,
When gurgoyles on the minster tower made faces at the moon,
And convent gardens were as bright as if it had been noon,-
Memling—the miser alchemist—then left his crimson vials,
His Arab books, his bottled toads, his sulphurous fiery trials,
His red-hot crucibles, and dyes that turned from white to blue,
His silver trees that starry rose the crystal vases through.
His room was piled with ponderous tomes, thick-ribb’d and
silver-clasp'd,
The letters twined with crimson flowers, the covers golden-
hasp'd,
With dripping stills and furnaces, whose doors were smoulder'd
black,
With
maps
of stars and charts of seas lined with untraversed
track.
In dusty corners of his room, black spiders mischief knit,
A skeleton, bound hand and foot, did ever by him sit.
Pale corpses, prison’d in glass, stood round bis chamber
barr'd,
Two mummies at his blister'd door kept ever watch and ward.
The “Red man" he had long since bound—the “Dragon” he
had chased,
No spell of Arab alchemist but he had long since traced,

They said he only stirr'd the lead and straight it turn'd to gold,
And so his wickedness and wealth increased a hundred-fold.
Slow round, as round a dial-plate, the statue's shadow pass’d,
On fountain and cathedral roof, by turns, eclipse it cast,
Before it fled the pale blue light, chased as man's life by Death,
Deep low you heard the great clock tick, like a sleeping giant's
breath.
III.
The moonbeams, in cascades of light, pour'd from the poplar's
crown,
Rippling in silvery lustre the leafy columns down,
They roof'd the town hall, fair and bright, with bonny silver
slates,
They even turn'd to argent pure the bars of the prison grates.
That day at sunset there had come a voice unto this man,
And said as plain as demon.voice or friendly spirit can,
“Go, Memling, dig beneath the base of the statue in the square,
The SECRET OF ALL SECRET's hid beneath the earth-heaps
there."
He shook his fist at stars and moon, then shut his furnace up,
First draining off a magic draught from an Egyptian cup,
For he dreamt he saw his room piled full of solid bars of gold,
Great bags of jewels, diamond-blocks, spoil of the kings of old.
The fitting hour was just at hand, the alchemist arose,
Upon the eaves the rain-drop tears in ice-jags shining froze,
His starry lantern duly lit, with cold he crept and shook,
As with his pickaxe and his spade, his stealthy way he took.
The shadow mark'd the fitting place, King Saturn ruled the
hour,
The devil floating o'er his slave smiled at his puny power;
Hans Memling plied his crowbar fast—the thirteenth blow he
gave,
The ponderous statue fell and crushed the brains out of the
knave.
Then clear and still the moonshine pure upon the lone square
lay,
No shadow left to sully it, it spread as bright as day;
At dawn they found Hans Memling, crushed, dead-cold
beneath the stone,
BUT WHAT HE SAW, AND WHAT HE FOUND, HAS NEVER YET BEEN
KNOWN.

“That's the third umbrella gone since Christmas. What
were you to do? Why, let him go home in the rain, to be
I'm very certain there was nothing about him that
could spoil. Take cold, indeed! He doesn't look like one of
the sort to take cold. Besides, he'd have better taken cold
than take our only umbrella. Do you hear the rain, Mr.
Caudle? I say, do you hear the rain? And as I'm alive,
if it isn't St. Swithin's day! Do you hear it against the
windows? Nonsense; you don't impose upon me. You
can't be asleep with such a shower as that! Do you hear it,
I say? Oh, you do hear it? Well, that's a pretty flood, I
think, to last for six weeks; and no stirring all the time out
of the house. Pooh! don't think me a fool, Mr. Caudle.
Don't insult me. He return the umbrella? Anybody would
think you were born yesterday. As if anybody ever did return
an umbrella! There-do you hear it? Worse and worse?
Cats and dogs, and for six weeks always six weeks. And
no umbrella?
“I should like to know how the children are to go to
school to-morrow? They shan't go through such weather,
I'm determined. No: they shall stop at home and never
learn anything—the blessed creatures !-sooner than go and
get wet.
And when they grow up, I wonder who they 'll
have to thank for knowing nothing-who, indeed, but their
father? People who can't feel for their own children ought
never to be fathers.
“ But I know why you lent the umbrella. Oh, yes; I
know very well. I was going out to tea at dear mother's
to-morrow-you knew that; and you did it on purpose.
Don't tell me; you hate me to go there, and take every
mean advantage to hinder me. But don't
you think it, Mr.
Caudle. No, sir; if it comes down in buckets-full, I'll go
all the more. No: and I won't have a cab. Where do you
think the money's to come from? You've got nice high
notions at that club of yours. A cab, indeed! Cost me
sixteen-pence at least, sixteen-pence! two-and-eightpence, for
there's back again. Cabs, indeed! I should like to know
who's to pay for 'em; I can't pay for 'em, and I'm sure you
can't, if you go on as you do; throwing away your property,
and beggaring your children-buying umbrellas!

and what's more, I'll walk every step of the way,-and you
know that will give me my death. Don't call me a foolish
woman, it's you that's the foolish man. You know I can't
wear clogs; and with no umbrella, the wet's sure to give me
a cold-it always does. But what do you care for that?
Nothing at all. I may be laid up for what you care, as I
daresay I shall--and a pretty. doctor's bill there'll be. I
hope there will! It will teach you to lend your umbrellas
again. I shouldn't wonder if I caught my death; yes: and
that's what you lent the umbrella for. Of course !
“ Nice clothes I shall get, too, trapesing through weather
like this. My gown and bonnet will be spoilt quite. Needn't
I wear 'em then? Indeed, Mr. Caudle, I shall wear 'em. No
sir, I'm not going out a dowdy to please you or anybody
else. Gracious knows! it isn't often that I step over the
threshold; indeed, I might as well be a slave at once,-better,
I should say. But when I do go out, Mr. Caudle, I choose to
go like a lady. Oh! that rain-- if it isn't enough to break
in the windows.
“Ugh! I do look forward with dread for to-morrow! How
I am to go to mother's I'm sure I can't tell. But if I die,
I'll do it. No, sir; I won't borrow an umbrella. No; and
you shan't buy one. Now, Mr. Caudle, only listen to this:
if you bring home another umbrella, I'll throw it in the street.
I'll have my own umbrella, or none at all.
“Ha! and it was only last week I had a new nozzle put to
that umbrella. I'm sure, if I'd have known as much as I do
now, it might have gone without one for me. Paying for new
nozzles, for other people to laugh at you. Oh, it's all very
well for you—you can go to sleep. You've no thought of
your poor patient wife, and your own dear children. You
think of nothing but lending umbrellas!
“Men, indeed!- call themselves lords of the creation !
pretty lords, when they can't even take care of an umbrella !
“I know that walk to-morrow will be the death of me.
But that's what you want then you may go to your club,
and do as you like—and then, nicely my poor dear children
will be used—but then, sir, then you'll be happy. Oh, don't
tell me! I know you will. Else you'd never have lent the
umbrella!
“ You have to go on 'Thursday about that summons; and, of
course, yon can't go. No, indeed, you
don't
go
without the
umbrella. You may loose the debt for what I care—it won't
be so much as spoiling your clothes-better loose it: people
deserve to loose debts who lend umbrellas!

“And I should like to know how I'm to go to mother's
without the umbrella? Oh, don't tell me that I said I would
go—that's nothing to do with it; nothing at all. She'll
think I'm neglecting her, and the little money we were to
have, we shan't have at all, because we've no umbrella.
“ The children, too! Dear things! They'll be sopping
wet: for they shan't stop at home—they shan't loose their
learning; it's all their father will leave 'em, I'm sure. But
they shall go to school. Don't tell me I said they shouldn't:
you are so aggravating, Caudle; you'd spoil the temper of an

umbrella!"---Douglas Jerrold.
THE TRIAL BY COMBAT.
The Grand Master at once commanded the herald to stand
forth and do his devoir. The trumpets then again flourished,
and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed aloud,- Oyez,
oyez, oyez.--Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free
blood who will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the
Jewess, Rebecca; and to such champion the Reverend and
Valorous Grand Master, here present, allows a fair field, and
equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else appertains
to a fair combat.” The trumpets again sounded, and there
was a dead pause of many minutes.
“No champion appears for the appellant,” said the Grand
Master. “Go, herald, and ask her whether she expects any
one to do battle for her in this her cause.” The herald went
to the chair in which Rebecca was seated, and spoke to her in
these terms: "Damsel, the Honourable and Reverend the
Grand Master demands of thee if thou art prepared with a
champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if thou dost
yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?"
“Say to the Grand Master," replied Rebecca, “that I
maintain my innocence, and do not yield me as justly con-
demned, lest I become guilty of mine own blood. Say to him,
that I challenge such delay as his forms will permit, to see if

God, whose opportunity is in man's extremity, will raise me
up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed, may
His holy will be done !” The herald retired to carry this
answer to the Grand Master.
“God forbid," said Lucas Beaumanoir, " that Jew or Pagan
should impeach us of injustice !-Until the shadows be cast
from the west to the eastward will we wait to see if a champion
shall appear for this unfortunate woman. When the day is
so far past, let her prepare for death."
The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master
to Rebecca, who bowed her head submissively, folded her
arms, and, looking up towards heaven, seemed to expect that
aid from above which she could scarce promise herself from
man.
66
a
It was the general belief that no one could or would appear
for a Jewess accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated
by Malvoisin, whispered to each other that it was time to
declare the pledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant à
knight, urging his horse to speed, appeared on the plain,
advancing towards the lists. A hundred voices exclaimed,
champion! a champion!” And despite the prepossessions and
prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously as the
knight rode into the tilt-yard. The second glance, however,
served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited.
His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared
to reel from fatigue; and the rider, however undauntedly he
presented himself in the lists, either from weakness, weariness,
or both, seemed scarcely able to support himself in the saddle.
To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his
name, and purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and
boldly, “I am a good knight and noble, come hither to sustain
with lance and sword the just and lawful quarrel of this
damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York; to uphold the
doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and to
defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and
liar; as I will prove in this field with my body against his, by
the aid of Heaven, of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint
George, the good knight."
“The stranger must first shew," said Malvoisin, “ that he
is a good knight, and of honourable lineage. The Temple
sendeth not forth her champions against nameless men.”
“My name," said the knight, raising his helmet, “is better
known, my lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I
am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.”
“I will not fight with thee at present," said the Templar.

in a changed and hollow voice. “Get thy wounds healed,
purvey thee a better horse, and it may be I will hold it worth
my while to scourge out of thee this boyish spirit of bravade."
“Ha! proud Templar," said Ivanhoe, “hast thou forgotten
that twice thou didst fall before this lance? Remember the
lists at Acre-remember the Passage of Arms at Ashby_
remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of Rotherwood, and
the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that thou
wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the
honour thou hadst lost! By that reliquary, and the holy
relic it contains, I will proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in
every court in Europe-unless thou do battle without further
delay.”
Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards
Rebecca, and then exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe,
“Dog of a Saxon! take thy lance, and prepare for the death
thou hast drawn upon thee!”
" Does the Grand Master allow me the combat ?" said
Ivanhoe.
“I may not deny what thou hast challenged," said the
Grand Master, “provided the maiden accepts thee as her
champion. Yet I would thou wert in better plight to do
battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever been, yet
would I have thee honourably met with.”
“ Thus—thus as I am, and not otherwise,” said Ivanhoe;
“it is the judgment of God—to His keeping I commend my-
self.-Rebecca," said he, riding up to the fatal chair, “ dost
thou accept of me for thy champion ?"
“I do,” she said, “ I do,"_fluttered by an emotion which
the fear of death had been unable to produce—“I do accept
thee as the champion whom Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no-
no—thy wounds are uncured. Meet not that proud man-
why shouldst thou perish also ?”
But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his
visor and assumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same;
and his esquire remarked, as he clasped his visor, that his
face, which had, notwithstanding the variety of emotions by
which he had been agitated, continued during the whole
morning of on ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very
much flushed.
The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, up-
lifted his voice, repeating thrice" Faites vos devours, preux
chevaliers !” After the third cry, he withdrew to one side of
the lists, and again proclaimed that none, on peril of instant
death, should dare, by word, cry, or action, to interfere with

or disturb this fair field of combat. The Grand Master, who
held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca's glove, now
threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal words,
" Laissez aller.”
The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other
in full career. The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less
exhausted rider, went down, as all had expected, before the
well-aimed lance and vigorous steed of the Templar. This
issue of the combat all had foreseen; but although the spear
of Invanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield of Bois-
Guilbert, that champion, to the astonishment of all who
beheld it, reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell in the
lists.
Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was
soon on foot, hastening to mend his fortune with his sword;
but his antagonist arose not. Wilfred, placing his foot on his
breast, and the sword's point to his throat, commanded him
to yield him, or die on the spot. Bois-Guilbert returned no
answer.

un-
Slay him not, Sir Knight," cried the Grand Master,
shriven and unabsolved-kill not body and soul! We allow
him vanquished.”
He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm
the conquered champion. His eyes were closed—the dark
red flush was still on his brow. As they looked on him in
astonishment, the eyes opened—but they were fixed and
glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to the
palid hue of death.
Unscathed by the lance of his enemy,
he had died a victim to the violence of his own contending
passions.
“This is indeed the judgment of God," said the Grand
Master, looking upwards —" Fiat voluntas tua!”

CLARENCE'S DREAM.
SIR ROBERT BRAKENBURY. DUKE OF CLARENCE.
Bruk. Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?
Clar. O, I have passed a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as am a Christian faithful
man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days;
So full of dismal terror was the time.

CLARENCE'S DREAM.
41
Brak. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
Clar. Methought that I had broken from the Tower
And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;
And in my company my brother Gloster,
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches; thence we look'd toward England,
And cited up a thousand heavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,
That had befall’n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloster stumbled, and, in falling,
Struck me (that thought to stay him) overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
O Lord ! methought what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears,
What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
Brak. Had you such leisure in that time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
Clar. Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
Brak. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
Clar. Ah, no, my dream was lengthened after life;
0, then began the tempest to my soul !
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul?
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
Who cried aloud, “What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ?"
And so he vanish’d: Then came wandering by

A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud, -
“Clarence is come,-false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury ;-
Seize on him, furies take him to your torments!”
With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise,
I trembling waked, and, for a season after,
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made my dream.
Brak. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
Clar. O, Brakenbury, I have done these things,
That now give evidence against my soul,-
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
But Thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute Thy wrath on me alone:
. O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep.
Brak. I will, my lord; God give your grace good rest
[Clar. retires.
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,-
Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.
Princes have but their titles for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imaginations,
They often feel a world of restless cares :
So that between their titles and low name,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame. --Shakespeare.

Blithe was the Captain's gallant heart, for things had pro-
spered well,
Soon should he reach his home on shore with much good news
to tell;
Good news for his Parsee merchants, and for the fair young
wife,
Whose sweet affection made the joy and beauty of his life.
Soon should he kiss his bonnie boy, and hold him on his knee,
Awhile he'd listen eager-eyed to stories of the sea;
Soon should he kiss his latest-born, and then the Captain
smiled,
Smiled father-like to think of her, his little unseen child.
Hark! what terrific cry was that of horror and affright,
Which broke like some tempestuous sound the stillness of the
night,
Rousing the crew from rest and sleep to tremble with dismay,
Waking the Captain's sunny dreams of harbour far away?
Oh, Captain, wake! 'Tis but a dream—the harbour is not won,
Thou dost not clasp thy Mary's hand, or kiss thy little son;
Thy baby sweetly sleeps ashore—that shore is far from thee-
Oh, Captain, wake! for none but God can save thy Golden
Bee.
“ FIRE!”_'twas an awful sound to hear on solitary seas,
With double danger in the breath of every fresh’ning breeze;
An awful sight it was to see the vessel all alight,
As if a blazing meteor dropped into the darksome night.
Foremost and calm amid his crew the Captain gave command,
Nor backward in a moment's need to help with skilful hand,
Awhile the courage in his voice and firmness on his brow
Imparted strength and hope to hearts which ne'er had drooped
till now.
“Get out the boats !" with firm quick voice the short com-
mand was said,
And no man spoke, but straight and swift the order was
- obeyed;
Then one by one the crew stepped forth—but all looked back
with tears,
Upon the bonnie Golden Bee, their home of many years.

But first the Captain snatched from flame, and pressed within
his breast,
A relic of departed days, of all his heart loved best:
A little Prayer-book, well-worn now, a gift in early life,
Sweet token from his early love ere yet he called her wife.
Then out upon a lonely sea, six hundred miles from land,
The solitary boat sailed forth with that courageous band;
Sailed forth as drifts a wither'd leaf upon the surging tide,
With only hope to be their strength, and only God as guide.
Eh, God! it was a fearful thing to float and drift away,
Upon so wide a wilderness, day after weary day,
With meagre store of food and drink which, ere two days had
rolled,
They measured out as never yet a miser did his gold.
Oh, Captain!" cried a sailor boy, "I ran away to sea,
And well I know my mother's heart has sorely grieved for me ;
Will some one take my parting love?-I shall not reach the
shore."
And then he smiled a saintly smile, nor smiled nor spoke no
a
more.
The red sun dipp'd into the sea, and lit the west afar,
The crimson clouds paled one by one, beneath the evening
star;
A calm of even-tide enwrapp'd both breeze and sky and wave,
When in God's great cathedral vault the sailor found a grave.
V
They wept no more—but, silent, stood and watched the placid
deep;
Thinking with wistful hearts of him who slept such blessed
sleep.
And one-a gaunt and giant man-sent forth a bitter cry,
And clenched his hand, and shrieked aloud, “OH, MASTER,
LET US DIE!”.
T
OH, LET US DIE! The words rang forth through the sweet
summer air,
As if a mad and tortured soul breath'd out its last wild
prayer.
They sounded far athwart the sea, and up into the sky,
Till even silence seemed to make the echo, “LET US DIE !"

WRECK OF THE GOLDEN BEE.

Then rose the Captain, sternly sad, and where the sun had set,
He waved one hand, and cried in tones which could command
them yet:
66
Oh, comrades ! will you see His works, and doubt that HE
can still
Save o'en in the eleventh hour, if such should be HIS WILL?
Oh, whilst there's life, despair not! Have we mothers,
children, wives !
Does not THEIR memory give us all the strength of double lives?
Mind ye not how the widow's cruse, though wasted, filled
again:
We've yet the widow's God o'erhead, and yet a little grain."

PART II.
Where palaces of merchant kings in marbled splendour rise-
And gleam beneath the burning blue of fair Calcutta's skies
Where orange groves and myrtle bowers weigh down the
sultry air,
The Captain's fair young wife abode, and watch'd his coming
there.
She never heard the billows roar, or saw a ship at sea,
Without a thought of those who steer'd the bonnie Golden
Bee;
She never kiss'd her babes at night, or woke at dawn of day,
Without a prayer that God would speed her sailor on his way.
One night rose up a fierce monsoon, and with a sudden roar,
Startled the waves from twilight rest, and dashed against the
shore;
Where all night long they shrieked and wailed, and sobbing
sunk to sleep,
As dying groans of shipwreck'd men fade on the silent deep.
The Captain's babes serenely slept, and through the tempest
smiled,
As sweet forget-me-nots bloom fair amid an Alpine wild;
The mother, weeping, clasp'd her hands, and pacing to and
fro,
Pray'd, with a white-faced misery, in murmurs faint and low.
“Oh, God! who 'mid ten thousand worlds has fixed Thy
glorious seat,
And cares for every human heart that worships at Thy feet.

Pity my happy, helpless babes--my watchful agony,
And guide my husband's precious life in safety back to me
Days glided by, and brought the time when every ship might
be
That one for which her soul was sick of wistfulness to see;
Days grew to weeks, and still she watch'd, and hoped, and
pray'd the same,
For the Golden Bee's safe advent which never, never came.
She held her children to her heart, and pray'd without a word
(Ofttimes the heart's unspoken prayer by Heaven is soonest
heard);
And if the heedless play'd or slept, the passion of her grief
Would spend itself in wailing tears, which brought her no
relief.
Then, as a soft and tranquil day follows a night of rain,
And drooping flowers will feel the sun, and ope their leaves
again,
For sweetest sake of feeble babes, no helper by save ONE,
She learned to lead a widow'd life, and say, “ THY WILL BE
DONE.'
One night the moon escaped from clouds, and with a pale
light gleam'd
Over the sea, which felt the glow, and murmur'd as it
dream'd;
Her bright boy cradled at her feet, her baby on her breast,
She sung her evening cradle song, and hush'd the pair to rest.

Awhile the elder child still drows'd, and like a drove in June,
Cooed from his little drowsy nest unto his mother's tune,
A ship that bore a foreign flag rode calmly with the tide,
And dropp'd its anchor in the port, by the fair city's side.
Before the mother's voice had ceased its chanting, fond and
sweet,
A distant footstep echoed through the silence of the street;
And when the boy's blue dreamy eyes sought for her face no
more,
A shadow fleck'd the window panes, and paused without the
door.

A shadow of a human form, but oh, so white and wan!
As if the strong vitality of manhood must be gone;

Then came a low breathed, tender voice, it only murmured
6 WIFE!”
And heart to heart the two were clasp'd, called back to new
glad life.
For hours they hardly spoke a word, but shedding blessed
tears,
Pour'd out their prayers of thankfulness to One who always
hears;
Those tears fell on their sleeping babes. O children, ye
receive
Such pure baptismal rite as Church or Priesthood ere can give.
-All the Year Round.
THE BASHFUL MAN.
I LABOUR under a species of distress, which, I fear, will at
length drive me utterly from this society, in which I am most
ambitious to appear; but I shall give you a short sketch of
my origin and present situation, by which you will be enabled
to judge of my difficulties.
You must know, I am of such extreme susceptibility of
shame, that, on the slightest subject of confusion, my blood
all rushes into my cheeks, and I appear a perfect full-blown
rose.
Sir Thomas Friendly, who lives about three miles distant,
is a baronet, with an estate of about two thousand pounds
a-year, adjoining that which I purchased. He has two small
sons and five tall daughters, all grown-up, and living at
Friendly-Hall, dependent on their father. Conscious of my
unpolished gait, I have, for some time past, taken private
lessons from a professor, who teaches “grown-up gentlemen
“
to dance ;” and although I at first found wondrous difficulty
in the art he taught, yet my knowledge of the mathematics
was of prodigious use, in teaching me the equilibrium of my
body, and the due adjustment of the centre of gravity to the
five positions. Having now acquired the art of walking
without tottering, and learned to make a bow, I boldly
ventured to accept the baronet's invitation to a family dinner;
not doubting but my new acquirements would enable me to
see the ladies with tolerable intrepidity; but alas! how vain
are all the hopes of theory, when unsupported by habitual
practice! As I approached the house, a dinner-bell alarmed
"

my fears, lest I had spoiled the dinner by want of punctuality.
Impressed with this idea, I blushed the deepest crimson
as my name was repeatedly announced by the several livery
servants, who ushered me into the library, hardly knowing
whom or what I saw. At my first entrance, I summoned all
my fortitude, and made my newly-acquired bow to Lady
Friendly; but, unfortunately, bringing back my left foot
into the third position, I trod upor the gouty toe of poor
Sir Thomas, who had followed close at my heels to be the
nomenclator of the family. The confusion this accident
occasioned in me is hardly to be conceived, since none but
bashful men can judge of my distress. The baronet's polite-
ness by degrees dissipated my concern; and I was astonished
to see how far good-breeding could enable him to suppress
his feelings, and to appear at perfect ease after so painful an
accident.
The cheerfulness of her ladyship, and the familiar chat of
the young ladies, insensibly led me to throw off my reserve
and sheepishness, till at length I ventured to join in the
conversation, and even to start fresh subjects. The library
being richly furnished with books in elegant bindings, I con-
ceived Sir Thomas to be a man of literature; and ventured to
give my opinion concerning the several editions of the Greek
classics—in which the baronet's ideas exactly coincided with
my own! To this subject I was led by observing an edition
of Xenophon, in sixteen volumes; which (as I had never
before heard of such a thing) greatly excited my curiosity,
and I approached to examine what it could be. Sir Thomas
saw what I was about, and (as I supposed) willing to save me
I
trouble, rose to take down the book, which made me more
eager to prevent him; and, hastily laying my hand on the
first volume, I pulled it forcibly—when, lo! instead of books,
a board, which, by leather and gilding, had been made to
look like sixteen volumes, came tumbling down, and, un-
luckily, pitched upon a wedgewood inkstand on the table
under it." In vain did Sir Thomas assure me there was no
harm done. I saw the ink streaming from an inlaid table
on the Turkey carpet; and, scarce knowing what I did,
attempted to stop its progress with my cambric handker-
chief. In the height of this confusion, we were informed
that dinner was served up.
In walking through the hall and suite of apartments to the
dining-room, I had time to collect my scattered senses; till I
was desired to take a seat at table, betwixt Lady Friendly
and her eldest daughter. Since the fall of the wooden Xeno-

phon, my face had been continually burning like a fire-brand;
and I was just beginning to recover myself, and to feel com-
fortably cool, when an unlooked for accident rekindled all my
heat and blushes. Having set my plate of soup too near the
edge of the table, in bowing to Miss Dinah, who politely
complimented the pattern of my waistcoat, Í tumbled the
whole scalding contents into my lap. In spite of an imme-
diate supply of napkins to wipe the surface of my clothes,
they were not stout enough to save me from the painful
effects of this sudden fomentation, and for some minutes, my
legs seemed stewed in a boiling caldron; but recollecting
how Sir Thomas had disguised his torture when I trod
upon his gouty toe, I firmly bore my pain in silence, and
sat with my lower extremities parboiled, amidst the stifled
giggling of the ladies and servants. I will not relate the
several blunders which I made during the first course, or the
distresses occasioned by my being desired to carve a fowl, or
help to various dishes that stood near me, spilling a sauce-
boat, and knocking down a salt-cellar; rather let me hasten
to the second course, where fresh disasters quite over-
whelmed me.
I had a piece of rich sweet pudding on my fork, when Miss
Louisa Friendly begged to trouble me for part of a pigeon
that stood near me. In my haste, scarce knowing what I
did, I whipped the pudding into my mouth-hot as a burning
coal! it was impossible to conceal my agony; my eyes were
starting from their sockets! At last, in spite of shame or
resolution, I was obliged to- -drop the cause of torment on
my plate. Sir Thomas and the ladies all compassionated my
misfortune, and each advised a different application. One
recommended oil, another water, but all agreed that wine
was perhaps the best for drawing out the heat; and a glass
of sherry was brought me from the side-board—I snatched
it up with eagerness : but oh! how shall I tell the sequel?
Whether the butler by accident mistook, or purposely. de-
signed to drive me mad, I know not; but he gave me the
strongest brandy, with which I filled my mouth, already
flayed and blistered. Totally unused to every kind of ardent
spirits, with my tongue, throat, and palate as raw as beef,
what could I do? I could not swallow, and, clapping my
hands upon my mouth, the burning liquor squirted through
my nose and fingers, like a fountain, over all the dishes, and
I was crushed by bursts of laughter from all quarters. In
vain did Sir Thomas reprimand the servants, and Lady
Friendly chide her daughters; the measure of my shame and

their diversion was not yet complete. To relieve me from
the intolerable state of perspiration which this accident had
caused, without considering what I did, I wiped my face
with that ill-fated kandkerchief, still wet from the conse-
quences of the fall of Xenophon, and covered my features
with streaks of ink in every direction! The baronet himself
could not support this shock, but joined his lady in the
general laugh; while I sprang from the table in despair,
rushed out of the house and ran home in an agony of con-
fusion and disgrace, which the most poignant sense of guilt
could not have excited.
Let me entreat that you will not add to my sufferings by
ungenerous ridicule; or still further increase my unhappy
notoriety, by making my infirmity, at any future time, the
subject of your conversation.—Mackenzie.

As dust! dross! offals! Let me at them !-Nay,

As I pass on,—“There goes my lord!" Aha!

And I'll go too; so on your wilfulness
Shall fall whate'er of evil may ensue.
Is't fit you waste your choler on a burr?
The nothings of the town; whose sport it is
To break their villain jests on worthy men,
The worthier the fitter! fie for shame!

No more than heed a cur.

Tal. You're right, sir; right.
For twenty crowns !-so there's my rapier up!.
You've done me a good turn against my will;
Which, like a wayward child, whose pet is off,
That made him restive under wholesome check,
I now right humbly own and thank
you
for.
Clif. No thanks, good Master Walter, owe you me.
I'm glad to know you, sir,
Wal. I pray you, now.
How did you learn my name? Guess'd I not right?
Was't not my comely hunch that taught it you?
Clif. I own it.
Wal. Right I know it; you tell truth,
I like
you
for't.
Clif. But when I heard it said
That Master Walter was a worthy man,
Whose word would pass on 'change soon as his bond;
A liberal man- —for schemes of public good
That sets own tens where others units write;
A charitable man—the good he does,
That's told of, not the half-I never more
Could see the hunch on Master Walter's back!
Wal. You would not flatter a poor citizen?
Clif. Indeed, I flatter not!
Wal. I like
your face-
A frank and honest one! Your frame's well knit,
Proportioned, shaped !
Clif. Good, sir!
Wal. Your name is Clifford.
Sir Thomas Clifford. Humph! You're not the heir
Direct to the fair baronetoy. He
That was, was drowned abroad. Am I not right?
Your cousin was 't not?—so succeeded you
To rank and wealth your birth ne'er promised you.
Clif. I see you know my history,
Wal. I do.
You 're lucky who conjoin the benefits
Of
penury and abundance: for I know

You do not blush, I see. That's right! Why should you?

What merit to be dropp'd on fortune's hill?

Wal. A prudent rule!
The turf is a seductive pastime?
Clif. Yes.
Wal. You keep a racing stud? You bet?
Clif. No, neither.
'Twas still my
father's precept—“
“ Better owe
A yard of land to labour, than to chance
Be debtor for a rood !”
Wal. 'Twas a wise precept.
You've a fair house-you'll get a mistress for it ?

Wal. In time? 'Tis time thy choice were made !
Is 't not so yet? Or is thy lady love
The newest still thou seest?
Clif. Nay, not so.
I'd marry, Master Walter, but old use-
For since the age of thirteen, I have lived
In the world-has made me jealous of the thing
That flatter'd me with hope of profit. Bargains
Another would snap up, might lie for me ;
Till I had turn'd and turn'd them! Speculations,
That promised twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,

When others were afloat, and out at sea;
Whereby I made small gains, but miss'd great losses.
As ever, then, I look'd before I leap'd,
So do I now.

To lift her to his state, and partner her!

That Cupid has not toy'd with; and a warm one-

Where nought but what is costly flourishes!
A consort for a king, sir !—You shall see her!

Methinks I see me at the altar-foot!
Her hand fast lock'd in mine the ring put on!
My wedding-bell rings merry in my ear;
And round me throng glad tongues that give me joy
To be the bridegroom of so fair a bride!

the Corporal. “He shall be supported ;” said my uncle
Toby. “He'll drop at last," said the Corporal; “and what
will become of his boy?” “He shall not drop;” said my
uncle Toby, firmly. A-well-a-day, do what we can for
him," said Trim, maintaining his point," the poor soul will
die." He shall not die, by HEAVEN;" cried my uncle Toby.
The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to heaven's chancery
with the oath, blushed as he gave it in; and the Recording
Angel, as he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon the word
and blotted it out for ever!
My uncle Toby went to his bureau-put his purse into his
pocket, and having ordered the Corporal to go early in the
morning for a physician, he went to bed and fell asleep.
The sun looked bright, the morning after, to every eye in
the village, but Le Fevre's and his afflicted son's; the hand
of death pressed heavy upon his eyelids; and hardly could
the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle-when my uncle
Toby (who had got up an hour before his wonted time)
entered the Lieutenant's room, and without preface or
apology, sat himself down upon the chair by the bedside, and
(independently of all modes and customs) opened the curtain,
in the manner an old friend and brother-officer would have
done it, and asked him how he did;-how he had rested in
the night; what was his complaint;, where was his pain;
—and what he could do to serve him?-and, without giving
him time to answer any one of the inquiries, went on and
told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with
the Corporal, the night before, for him.
“ You shall go home directly, Le Fevre,” said my uncle
Toby, “to my house ;-and we'll send for a doctor to see
what's the matter ;-and we'll have an apothecary ;-and the
Corporal shall be your nurse ;-and I'll be your servant, Le
Fevre !"
There was a frankness in my uncle Toby,—not the effect
of familiarity, but the cause of it --which let you at once
into his soul, and shewed you the goodness of his nature ;-
to this, there was something in his looks, and voice, and
manner, superadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfor-
tunate, to come and take shelter under him; so that, before
my uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was
making to the father, had the son insensibly pressed up close
to his knees, and had taken hold of the breast of his coat,
and 'was pulling it towards him. The blood and spirits of

Are most select and generous, chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry..
This above all,—To thine ownself be true;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!-Shakespeare.
POOR MARGARET.
[By kind permission of CHARLES DICKENS, Esq.]
Poor Margaret's window is alight;
Poor Margaret sits alone;
Though long into the silent night,
And far the world is gone.
She lives in shadow till her blood
Grows blackened, soul and all;
Upon her head a mourning hood,
Upon her heart a pall.
Her heart is wandering in a whirl,
And she must seek the tomb
Where lies her long-lost little girl,
Oh well with them for whom
Love's morning star comes round so fair
As evening star of faith,
Already up and shining, ere
The dark of coming death.
But Margaret cannot reach a hand
Beyond the dark of death;
Her spirit swoons in that high land
Where breathes no human breath:
She cannot look upon the grave
As one eternal shore,
From which a soul may take the wave
For heaven, to sail or soar.

All the young mother in her old voice
Its waking moan will make;
A young aurora light her eyes
With radiance gone to wreck!
And then at dawn sbe will return
To her old self again,
Eyes dim and dry, heart gray and dern,
And querulous in her pain.
“We never loved each other much,
I and my poor good-man !
But on the child we lavish'd such
A love as overran
All boundaries, loving her the more
Because our love was pent;
Striving as two seas try to pour
Their strength through one small rent.
“ For children come to still link hands,
When souls have fallen apart;
And hide the rift when either stands
At distance heart from heart.
So on our little one we'd look,
Press hands with fonder grasp,
As though we closed some holy book,
Softly with golden clasp.
“Our little Golden-heart, her name,
And all things sweet and calm,
And pure and fragrant, round her came
With gifts of bloom and balm.
And there she grew, my queen of all,
Golden, and saintly-white,
Just as at Summer's smiling call
The lily stands alight.
“ To knee or nipple grew the goal
Of her wee stately walk;
The voice of my own silent soul
Was her dear baby-talk.
Then darklingly she pined and faild,
And looking on our dead,
The father wailed awhile and ail'd,
Turn'd to the wall and said:
««'Tis dark and still our house of life,
The fire is burning low,

Our pretty one is gone, and, wife,
Tis time for me to go:
Our Golden-heart has gone to sleep,
She's happ'd in for the night;
And so to bed I'll quietly creep,
And sleep till morning light.'"
Once more poor Margaret arose,
And pass'd into the night:
Long shadows weird of tree and house
Made ghosts i' the wan moonlight !
She pass'd into the churchyard, where
The many glad life-waves
That leapd of old, have stood still there
In
green
and
grassy graves.
“Oh, would my body were at rest
Under this cool grave sward !
Oh, would my soul were with the blest,
That slumber in the Lord !
They sleep so sweetly underground
For death hath shut the door,
And all the world of sorrow and sound
Can trouble them no more.”
A spirit feel is in the place,
That makes the
poor
heart
gasp;
Her soul stands white up in her face
For one warm human clasp !
To-night she sees the grave astir,
And, as in prayer she kneels,
The mystery opens unto her:
She for the first time feels
The spirit world may be as near
Her, moving silent round,
As are the dead that sleep a mere
Short fathom underground.
And there be eyes that see the sight
Of lorn ones, wandering, vex'd
Through some long, sad, and shadowy night
Betwixt this world and next.
Doorways of fear are eye
and
ear,
Through which the wonders go ;
And through the night with glow-worm light
The church is all aglow!

She enters : all the air
With faces fills, divine and dim,
The blessed dead are there.
One came and bade poor Margaret sit,
Seem'd to her as it smiled,
A great white bird of God alit
From the marble forest wild.
“ LOOK TO THE ALTAR !" there a spell
Fix'd her; she saw up start
A woman, like a soul in hell:
'Twas her own Golden-heart.

“It would have been thus, mother dear,
And so God took her, from
All trials and temptations here,
To His eternal home;
And

Where death can never part.”
She looked up in that angel's face :
'Twas her own Golden-heart.
The lofty music rose again
From all those happy souls,
Till all the windows thrill'd, as when
The organ thunder rolls;
And all her life is like a light,
Weak weed the stream doth sway
Until it reaches its full height,
Breaks, and is borne away.

Her life stood still to listen to
That music! then a hand
Took hers, and she was floated through
The mystic border-land.
'Twas Golden-heart! from that eclipse
She drew her into bliss :
Two spirits closed at dying lips,
In one immortal kiss.
Next day, an early worshipper
Was kneeling in the aisle ;
A statue of life that did not stir
But knelt on with a smile

THE HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.

Upon the face that smiled with light,
As though, when left behind,
It smiled on with some glorious sight,
Long after the eyes were blind.
-All the Year Round.
THE HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.
JOHN GILPIN was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
A train-band Captain eke was he
Of famous London town.
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
Though wedded we have been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we
No holiday have seen.
" To-morrow is our wedding-day,
And we will then repair
Unto the Bell at Edmonton,
All in a chaise and pair.
“ My sister and my sister's child,
Myself and children three,
Will fill the chaise, so you must ride.
On horseback after we.”
He soon replied—“I do admire
Of womankind but one,
And you are she my
dearest dear,
Therefore it shall be done.
I am a linen draper bold,
As all the world doth know,
And my good friend the Calender
Will lend his horse to go.”
Quoth Mrs. Gilpin " That's well said;
And for that wine is dear,
We will be furnish'd with our own,
Which is both bright and clear.”
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;
O'erjoyed was he to find
That though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.
"

The morning came, the chaise was brought,
But yet was not allow'd
To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say
that she was proud.
So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog
To dash through thick and thin.
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
Were never folk so glad,
The stones did rattle underneath
As if Cheapside were mad.
John Gilpin at his horse's side
Seized fast the flowing mane,
And
up
he got in haste to ride,
But soon came down again.
For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,
His journey to begin,
When turning round his head. he saw
Three customers come in.
So, down he came; for loss of time,
Although it grieved him sore,
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
Would trouble him much more.
'Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind,
When Betty screaming came down stairs,
“ The wine is left behind !”
“Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
My leathern belt likewise,
In which I bear my trusty sword
When I do exercise."
Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,
Had two stone bottles found,
To hold the liquor that she loved,
And keep it safe and sound.
Each bottle had a curling ear;
Through which the belt he drew,
And hung a bottle on each side,
To make his balance true.

Then over all that he might be
Equipp'd from top to toe,
His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,
He manfully did throw.
Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed,
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones
With caution and good heed.
But finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot,
Which gall’d him in his seat.
So, “Fair and softly," John he cried,
But John he cried in vain;
That trot became a gallop soon,
In spite of curb or rein.
So
stooping down, as needs he must
Who cannot sit upright,
He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,
And eke with all his might.
His horse, who never in that sort
Had handled been before,
What thing upon his back had got
Did wonder more and more.
Away went Gilpin neck or nought,
Away went hat and wig!
He little dreamt when he set out
Of running such a rig!
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,
Like streamer long and gay,
And loop and button failing both,
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern
The bottles he had slung,
A bottle swinging at each side,
As hath been said or sung.
The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,
Up flew the windows all,
And every soul cried out, “ WELL DONE!"
As loud as he could bawl.

Away went Gilpin—who but he?
His fame soon spread around-
“He carries weight, he rides a race!
'Tis for a thousand pound!"
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view,
How in a trice the turnpike-men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now, as he went bowing down
His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shattered at a blow.
Down ran the wine into the road.
Most piteous to be seen,
Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
As they had basted been.
But still he seem'd to carry weight,
With leathern girdle braced,
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist.
Thus all through merry Islington,
These gambols he did play,
And till he came unto the “ Wash"
Of Edmonton so gay.
And there he threw the wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop,
Or a wild
goose
at play.
At Edmonton his loving wife
From the balcony spied
Her tender husband, wond'ring much
To see how he did ride.
STOP, STOP, JOHN GILPIN !-Here's the house”
They all at once did cry;
• The dinner waits and we are tired :".
Said Gilpin-"So' AM I."
But yet his horse was not a whit
Inclined to tarry there;
For why? his owner had a house
Full ten miles off at Ware.

So like an arrow swift he flew,
Shot by an archer strong:
So did he fly—which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the Calender's
His horse at last stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbour in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him :-
“What news? what news? your tidings tell.
Tell me you must and shall-
Say why bare-headed you are come,
Or why you come at all ?”
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke,
And thus unto the Calender
In
merry guise he spoke:-
“I came because your horse would come;
And if I well forbode,
My hat and wig will soon be here,
They are upon the road."
The Calender, right glad to find
His friend in merry pin,
Return'd him not a single word,
But to the house went in.
Whence straight he came with bat and wig;
A wig that flow'd behind,
A hat not much the worse for wear,
Each comely in its kind.
He held them up, and in his turn
Thus shew'd his ready wit:-
“ My head is twice as big as yours,
They therefore needs must fit.
“But let me scrape the dirt away
That hangs upon your face;
And stop and eat for well you may
Be in a hungry case."

Said John-"It is my wedding day,
And all the world would stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton
And I should dine at Ware.”
So, turning to his horse, he said.
“ I am in haste to dine;
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
You shall go back for mine.”
Ah! luckless speech and bootless boast!
For which he paid full dear;
For, while he spake a braying ass
Did sing most loud and clear.
Whereat his horse did snort as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And gallop'd off with all his might,
As he had done before.
Away went Gilpin, and away
Went Gilpin's hat and wig!
He lost them sooner than at first,
For why?—they were too big!
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
Her husband posting down
Into the country far away,
She pulled out half a crown;
And thus unto the youth she said
That drove them to the Bell,-
“ This shall be yours when you bring back
My husband safe and well.”
The youth did ride, and soon did meet
John coming back amain;
Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
By catching at his rein;
But not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done,
The frighted steed he frighted more,
And made him faster run.
Away went Gilpin, and away
Went post-boy at his heels!
The post-boy's horse right glad to miss
The lumb'ring of the wheels.

Six gentlemen upon the road,
Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With post-boy, scamp'ring in the rear,
They raised the hue and cry:
“Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman"-
Not one of them was mute;
And all and each that pass'd that way
Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gate again
Flew open in short space;
The toll-men thinking, as before,
That Gilpin rode a race.
And so he did, and won it too,
For he got first to town;
Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
He did again get down.
Now let us sing, “ Long live the king,
And Gilpin long live he;
And when be, next doth ride abroad,
May I be there to see!"

Abs. Not a word of her, sir.
Sir Anth. Odd so-I mustn't forget her though. Yes,
Jack, the independence I was talking of is by a marriage-
the fortune is saddled with a wife—but I suppose that makes
no difference.
Abs. Sir! sir! you amaze me!
Sir Anth. Why, what on earth 's the matter with the fool?
Just now you were all gratitude and duty.
Abs. I was, sir,-you talked to me of independence and a

promise to love, and to marry her directly.

Sir Anth. I am sure, sir, 'tis more unreasonable in you to
object to a lady you know nothing of!
Abs. You must excuse me, sir, if I tell you, once for all,

SACK OF THE BASTILLE.
[By kind permission of ThomAS CARLYLE, Esq.)
All the morning, since nine, there has been a cry everywhere-
“ To the Bastille !” Repeated “ deputations of citizens” have
been here, passionate for arms, whom De Launay has got
dismissed by soft speeches through port-holes. Towards noon
Elector Thuriot de la Rosiere gains admittance ; finds De
Launay indisposed for surrender ; nay, disposed for blowing
up the place rather.
Woe to thee, De Launay, in such an hour, if thou canst not
(taking some one firm decision) rule circumstances ! Soft
speeches will not serve; hard grapeshot is questionable ; but
hovering between the two is unquestionable. Ever wilder
swells the tide of men; their infinite hum waxing ever louder
into imprecations,—perhaps into crackle of stray musketry;
which latter, on walls nine feet thick, cannot do much
execution. The outer drawbridge has been lowered for
Thuriot; new “ deputation of citizens " (it is the third, and
noisiest of all) penetrates that way into the outer court. Soft
speeches producing no clearance of these, De Launay gives
fire; pulls up his drawbridge. A slight sputter—which has
kindled the too combustible chaos—made it a roaring fire-
chaos! Bursts forth insurrection, at sight of its own blood
(for there were deaths by that sputter of fire), into endless
rolling explosion of musketry, distraction, execration ;-and
overhead, from the fortress, let one great gun, with its grape-
shot, go booming, to shew what we could do, The Bastille is
besieged !
On, then, all Frenchmen that have hearts in
bodies!
Roar with all your throats of cartilage and metal, ye Sons of
Liberty! stir spasmodically whatsoever of utmost faculty is in
you,--soul, body, or spirit,--for it is the hour! Smite, thou
Louis Tournay,-cartwright of the Marais,-old soldier of
the Regiment Dauphine; smite at that outer drawbridge
though the fiery hail whistles round thee! Never, over nave
or felloe, did thy axe strike such a stroke! Down with it,
man! down with it to Orcus! let the whole accursed edifice
sink thither, and tyranny be swallowed up for ever! Mounted

stuck into joints of the wall”) Louis Tournay smites : brave
Aubin Bonnemere (also an old soldier) seconding him; the
chain yields, breaks; the huge drawbridge slams down,
thundering. Glorious ! and yet, alas, it is still but the out-
works! The eight grim towers, with their Invalide musketry,
their paving-stones and cannon mouth, still soar aloft intact;
ditch yawning impassable, stone-faced; the inner drawbridge
with its back towards us. The Bastille is still to take.
Frantic patriots pick up the grape-shots: bear them, still
hot (or seemingly so), to the Hotel de Ville. Paris, you
perceive, is to be burnt! Flessells is."pale to the very lips,"
for the roar of the multitude grows deep. Paris wholly has
got to the acme of its frenzy; whirled all ways by panic mad-
At every street barricade there whirls simmering a
minor whirlpool, strengthening the barricade, since God knows
what is coming; and all minor whirlpools play distractedly
into that grand Fire-Maelstrom which is lashing round the
Bastille.
Blood flows-the aliment of new madness. The wounded
are carried into houses of the Rue Cerisaie; the dying leave
their last mandate not to yield till the accursed stronghold
fall. And yet, alas ! how fall ? The walls are so thick!
Deputations (three in number) arrive from the Hotel de
Ville; Abbe Fauchet (who was one) can say with what
almost superhuman courage of benevolence.
These wave
their town flag in the arched gateway, and stand rolling their
drum—but to no purpose. In such crack of doom De Launay
cannot hear them, dare not believe them : they return with
justified rage, the sound of lead still singing in their ears.
How the great Bastille clock ticks (inaudible) in its inner
court there, at its ease, hour after hour, as if nothing special
for it or the world was passing ! It tolled one when the
firing began, and is now pointing towards five, and still the
firing slacks not. Far down in their vaults the seven
prisoners hear muffled din as of earthquakes; their turnkeys.
answer vaguely.
What shall De Launay, do? One thing only De Launay
could have done—what he said he would do. Fancy him
sitting, from the first, with lighted taper, within arm's length
of the
powder magazine, motionless (like an old Roman senator,
or bronze lamp-holder), coldly apprising Thuriot, and all men,
by a slight motion of his eye, what his resolution was.
Harmless he sat there while unharmed: but the king's fortress
meanwhile could, might, would, or should, in no wise be
surrendered, save to the king's messenger.
One old man's

W
life is worthless, so it be lost with honour; but think ye,
brawling canaille, how will it be when a whole Bastille springs
skywards ! In such statuesque, taper-holding attitude, one
fancies De Launay might have left Thuriot, the red clerks of
the Basoche, Curé of Saint Stephen, and all the tag-rag-and-
bobtail of the world, to work their will.
For four hours now has the world bedlam roared ; call it
the world chimæra, blowing fire. The poor Invalides have
sunk under their battlements, to rise only with reversed
muskets. They have made a white flag of napkins; go
beating the chamade, or seeming to beat, for one can hear
nothing. The very Swiss at the portcullis look weary of
firing, disheartened in the fire deluge. A port-hole at the
drawbridge is opened, as by one that would speak. See
Hussier Maillard, the shifty man! On his plank, swinging
over the abyss of that stony ditch-plank resting on parapet,
balanced by weight of patriots-he hovers perilious ! such a
dove towards such an ark! Deftly, thou shifty usher! one
man already fallen, lies smashed far down there against the
masonry. Usher Maillard falls not; deftly, unerring he
walks with outspread palm.
The Swiss holds a paper
through his port-hole; the shifty usher snatches it, and
returns. Terms of surrender, “ Pardon, immunity to all.
Are they accepted ?" Foi ďofficier” (on the word of an
officer), answers half-pay Hulin-or half-pay Elie--for men do
not agree on it—"they are !” Sinks the drawbridge; Usher
Maillard bolting it when down; rushes in the living deluge-
the Bastille is fallen! Victoire! La Bastille est prise!

a
I sleep so sound all night, mother, that I shall never wake,
If you do not call me loud, when the day begins to break;
But I must gather knots of flowers, and buds, and garlands
gay,
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
As I came up the valley,—whom think you should I see
But Robin leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel-tree;
He thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave him yesterday-,
But I'm to be Queen of the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
He thought I was a ghost, mother,--for I was all in white,
And I ran by him without speaking, like a flash of light.
They call me cruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
Little Effie shall go with me to-morrow to the green,
And
you 'll be there too, mother, to see me made the Queen;
For the shepherd lads on every side'll come from far away,
And I'm to be Queen o’the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
The honeysuckle round the porch has wov'n its wavy bowers,
And by the meadow-trenches, blow the faint sweet cuckoo-
flowers;
And the wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and
hollows gray :
And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
The night winds come and go, mother, upon the meadow grass,
And the happy stars above them seem to brighten as they pass;
There will not be a drop of rain the whole of the livelong day,
And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
the May.
All the valley, mother, 'ill be fresh and green and still,
And the cowslip and the crowfoot are over all the hill,
And the rivulet in the flowery dale 'll merrily glance and play;
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'
the May.
So
you must wake and call me early,—call me early, nother
dear;
To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad new year:

To-morrow 'ill be of all the year the maddest, merriest day;
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o?
the May.
NEW YEAR'S EVE.
If you 're waking call me early,-call me early, mother dear;
For I would see the sun rise upon the glad new year:-
It is the last new year that I shall ever see,
Then you may lay me low i' the mould and think no more of
me.
To-night I saw the sun set: he set and left behind
The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace of mind;
And the new year's coming up, mother, but I shall never see
The blossom on the blackthorn, the leaf upon
the tree.
Last May we made a crown of flowers; we had a merry day;
Beneath the hawthorn on the green they made me Queen of
May:
And we danced about the May-pole and in the hazel copse,
Till Charles's wain came out about the tall white chimney tops.
There's not a flower on all the hills :—the frost is on the
pane ;-
I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again:
I wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on high:-
I long to see a flower so before the day I die.
The building rook 'll caw from the windy tall elm tree,
And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea;
And the swallow 'll come again with summer o'er the wave,
But I shall lie alone, mother, within the mouldering grave.
Upon the chancel casement, and upon
of mine,
In the early,-early morning the summer sun 'll shine,
Before the red cock crows from the farm upon the hill,
When you are warm asleep, mother, and all the world is still.
When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning
that
grave
light,
You'll never see me more in the long gray fields at night;
When from the dry, dark wold, the summer airs blow cool
On the oat-grass and the sword-grass, and the bulrush in the
pool.
You 'll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn shade,
And you'll come sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid-

I shall not forget you, mother, I shall hear you when you pass,
With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant grass.
I have been wild and wayward, -but you 'll forgive me now;
You 'll kiss me, my own mother, upon my cheek and brow-
Nay, nay, you must not weep, nor let your grief be wild;
You shall not fret for me, mother, you have another child.
If I can,—I'll come again, mother, from out my resting-place;
Though you 'll not see me, mother, I shall look upon your face,
Though I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken what you say,
And be often, often with you
when
you
think I'm far away.
Good night!—good night !-when I have said “good night"
for evermore,
And you see me carried out from the threshold of the door,
Don't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing green,
She'll be a better child to you than ever I have been.
She'll find my garden tools upon the granary floor;
Let her take 'em, they are hers; I shall never garden more;
But tell her, when I'm gone, to train the rosebush that I set
About the parlour window, and the box of mignonette.
Good night, sweet mother: call me before the day is born,
All night I lay awake, but I fall asleep at morn;
Ι
But I would see the sun rise upon the glad new year,-
So, if you ’re waking, call me.--call me early, mother dear.
CONCLUSION.
I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am:
And in the fields all around I hear the bleating of the lamb.
How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!
To die before the snow-drop came,--and now the violet's here.
O sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies,
And sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot rise,
And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that blow,
And sweeter far is death than life;—to me that long to go.
It seem'd so hard at first, mother, to leave the blessed sun,
And now it seems as hard to stay, and yet His will be done!
But still I think it can't be long before I find release;-
And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peaco.
Oh, blessings on his kindly voice, and on his silver hair!
And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there!

me in:
For my
was
Oh, blessings on his kindly heart, and on his silver head !
A thousand times I blest him, as he knelt beside
my
bed.
He shew'd me all the mercy,—for he taught me all the sin;-
Now, though my lamp was lighted late, there's One will let
Nor would I now be well,-mother,—again, if that could be,
desire is but to pass to Him that died for me.
I did not hear the dog howl,-mother,-or the death-watch
beat,
There came a sweeter token when the night and morning
meet;
But sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,
And Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign.-
All in the wild March morning I heard the angels call;-
It when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;-
The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,
And in the wild March morning I heard them call my
soul.
For lying broad awake I thought of you and Effie dear;
I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here:
With all my strength I pray'd for both, and so I felt resign'd,
And
up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.
I thought that it was fancy, and I listen'd in my bed,
And then did something speak to me-I know not what was
said,
For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,
And up the valley came again the music on the wind.
But you were sleeping : and I said, “It's not for them ; it's
mine!
And if it comes three times, I thought, I take it for a sign.”
And once again it came, and close beside the window-bars,
Then seem'd to go right up to Heaven, and die among the stars.
So now I think my time is near. I trust it is. I know
The blessed music went that way my soul will have to go.
And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day;
But, Effie, you must comfort her when I am pass'd away.
Oh, look! the sun begins to rise, the heavens are in a glow;
He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know:
And there I move no longer now, and there his light may
shine
Wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.

ELIZA'S ESCAPE.
77
O sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is done,
The voice, that now is speaking, may be beyond the sun :-
For ever and for ever with those just souls and true
And what is life that we should moan?—why make we such
ado?
a
For ever and for ever all in a blessed home-
And there to wait a little while till you and Effie come
To lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your breast-
And the “wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at
rest."
-Tennyson.
ELIZA'S ESCAPE.
THE frosty ground creaked beneath her feet, and she trembled
at the sound; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent
the blood backward to her heart, and quickened her foot-
steps. She wondered within herself at the strength that
seemed to be come upon her; for she felt the weight of her
boy as if it had been a feather, - and every flutter of fear
seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on,
while from her pale lips burst forth, in frequent ejaculations,
the
prayer to a Friend above, “ Lord help; Lord save me.”
If it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were
going to be torn from you by a brutal trader to-morrow
morning-if you had seen the man, and heard that the papers
were signed and delivered, and you had only from twelve
o'clock till morning to make good your escape-how fast
could you walk? How many miles could you make in those
few brief hours, with your darling at your bosom—the little
sleepy head on your shoulder--the small soft arms trustingly
holding on to your neck ?
For the child slept. At first the novelty and alarm kept
him waking ; but his mother so hurriedly repressed every
breath or sound, and so assured him that if he were only still
she would certainly save him, that he clung quietly round
her neck, only asking, as he found himself sinking to sleep-
“Mother, I don't need to keep awake, do I?"
“No, my darling; sleep, if you want to."
“But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let him get
me?”
“No! so may Heaven help me!" said his mother, with a
paler cheek, and a brighter light in her large dark eyes.

" You're sure,
an't
you,
mother?"
“ Yes, sure!” said the mother, in a voice that startled
herself; for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within
that was no part of her; and the boy dropped his little
weary head on her shoulder, and was soon asleep. How the
touch of the child's warm arms, and his gentle breathing,
seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements! It seemed
to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams, from
every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding
child. Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body,
that for a time can make flesh and nerve impregnable, and
string the sinews like steel, so that the weak become so
mighty.
An hour before sunset, she entered a village by the Ohio
river, which lay, like Jordan,' between her and the Canaan of
liberty on the other side.
It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and
turbulent; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily
to and fro in the turbid waters. Owing to the peculiar form
of the shore on the Kentucky side, the land bending far out
into the water, the ice had been lodged and detained in great
quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round the
bend was full of it, piled one cake over another, thus forming
a temporary barrier to the descending masses, which lodged
and formed a great undulating raft, filling up the whole river,
and extending almost to the Kentucky shore.
Eliza stood for a moment contemplating this unfavourable
aspect of things, which she saw at once must prevent the
usual ferry boat from running, and then turned into a small
public-house on the bank to make a few inquiries.
6. Take him into this room,” said the hostess, opening into a
small bed-room where stood a comfortable bed. Eliza laid
the weary boy upon it, and held his hands in hers till he was
fast asleep. For her there was no rest. As a fire in her
bones, the thoughts of the pursuer urged her on; and she
gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters, that
·lay between her and liberty.
In consequence of all the various delays, it was about three-
quarters of an hour after Eliza had laid her child to sleep in
the village tavern that the pursuing party came riding into the
same place. Eliza was standing by the window, looking out
in another direction, when Sam's quick eye caught a glimpse
of her. Haley and Andy were two yards behind. At this
crisis Sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and uttered
a loud and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her at

once; she drew suddenly back,—the whole train swept by the
window, round to the front door.
A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one
moment to Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to the
river. She caught her child, and sprang down the steps
towards it. The trader caught a glimpse of her, just as she
was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself from
his horse, and calling loudly to Sam and Andy, he was after
her like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her
feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground, and an instant
brought her to the water's edge. Right on behind they came;
and, nerved with strength such as God gives only to the
desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she vaulted
sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of
ice beyond! It was a desperate leap-impossible to anything
but madness and despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy
instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she
,
did it.
The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted
pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she stayed
there not a moment. With wild cries and desperate energy
she leaped to another and still another cake,- stumbling-
leaping-slipping--springing upwards again! Her shoes are
gone—her stockings cut from her feet-while blood marked
every step; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as
in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up
the bank.--Mrs. H. B. Stowe.

An' because they loved Erin, an' scorned to sell it,
A
prey for the bloodhound, a mark for the bullet
Unsheltered by night, and unrested by day,
With the heath for their barrack, revenge for their pay;
An' the bravest and hardiest boy iv them all
Was Shamus O'Brien, from the town of Glingall.
His limbs were well set, an' his body was light,
An' the keen-fanged hound had not teeth half so white;
But his face was as pale as the face of the dead,
An' his cheek never warmed with the blush of the red;
An' for all that he wasn't an ugly young bye,
For a demon himself couldn't blaze with his eye,
So droll an' so wicked, so dark an' so bright,
Like a fire-flash that crosses the depth of the night!
An' he was the best mower that ever has been,
An' the illigantest hurler that ever was seen.
An' his dancin' was sich that the men used to stare,
An' the women turn crazy, he done it so quare;
An' by gorra, the whole world gev it into there.
An' it's he was the boy that was hard to be caught,
An' it's often he run, and it's often he fought,
An' it's many the one can remember right well
The quare things he done: an' it's often I heerd tell
How he lathered the yeomen, himself again four,
An' stretched the two strongest on old Galtimore.
But the fox must sleep sometimes, the wild deer must rest,
An' treachery prey on the blood iv the best;
Afther many a brave action of power and pride,
An' many a hard night on the mountain's bleak side,
An' a thousand great dangers and toils overpast,
In the darkness of night he was taken at last.
Now, Shamus, look back on the beautiful moon,
For the door of the prison must close on you soon,
An' take your last look at her dim lovely light,
That falls on the mountain and valley this night;
One look at the village, one look at the flood,
An' one at the sheltering, far-distant wood;
Farewell to the forest, farewell to the hill,
An' farewell to the friends that will think of
you
Farewell to the pathern, tbe hurlin', an' wake,
And farewell to the girl that would die for your sake.

An' the turnkey resaved him, refusing all bail;
The fleet limbs wor chained, an' the sthrong handswor bound,

An' the dreams of his childhood kem over him there
As gentle an' soft as the sweet summer air;
An' happy remembrances crowding on ever,
As fast as the foam-flakes dhrift down on the river,
Bringing fresh to his heart merry days long gone by,
Till the tears gather'd heavy and thick in his eye.
But the tears didn't fall, for the pride of his heart
Would not suffer one drop down his pale cheek to start;
An' he sprang to his feet in the dark prison cave,
An' he swore with the fierceness that misery gave,
By the hopes of the good and the cause of the brave,
That when he was mouldering in the cold grave
His enemies never should have it to boast
His scorn of their vengeance one moment was lost;
His bosom might bleed, but his cheek should be dbry,
For undaunted he lived, and undaunted he'd die.
Well, as soon as a few weeks was over and gone,
The terrible day iv the thrial kem on,
There was sich a crowd there was scarce room to stand,
An' sodgers on guard, an' dhragoons sword in hand;
An' the court-house so full that the people were bother'd,
Au' attorneys an'criers on the point of being smothor'd;
An' counsellors almost gev over for dead,
An' the jury sitting up in their box overhead;
An' the judge settled out so detarmined and big,
With his gown on his back, and an illigant new wig;
An' silence was called, an' the minute it was said
The court it was still as the heart of the dead,
An' they heard but the openin' of one prison lock,
An' Shamus O'Brien kem into the dock.
For one minute he turn'd his eye round on the throng,
An' he look'd at the bars, so firm and so strong,
An' he saw that he had not a hope nor a friend,
A chance to escape, nor a word to defend;
An' he folded his arms as he stood there alone,
As calm and as cold as a statue of stone;
An' they read a big writin', a yard long at laste,
An' Jim didn't understand it, nor mind it a taste,
An' the judge took a big pinch iv snuff, and he says,
“ Are you guilty or not, Jim O'Brien, av you plase?"
An' all held their breath in the silence of dhread,
An' Shamus O'Brien made answer and said:

That should call to my cheek, as I stand alone here,
The hot blush of shame, or the coldness of fear,
Though I stood by the grave to receive my death-blow
Before Heav'n and the world I would answer you, No!
But if you would ask me, as I think it like,
If in the rebellion I carried a pike,
An' fought for ould Ireland from the first to the close,
An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes,
I answer you, Ves; and I tell you again,
Though I stand here to perish, it's my glory that then
In her cause I was willing my veins should run dhry.
An' that now for her sake I am ready to die.”
Then the silence was great, and the jury smiled bright,
An' the judge wasn't sorry the job was made light;
By my sowl, it's himself was the crabbed ould chap!
In a twinklin' he pulled on his ugly black cap.
Then Shamus's mother in the crowd standin' by,
Called out to the judge with a pitiful cry:
“0, judge darlin', don't, O, don't say the word!
The crathur is
mercy, my lord;
He was foolish, he didn't know what he was doin';
You don't know him, my lord-Oh, don't give him to ruin !
He's the kindliest crathur, the tendherest-hearted;
Don't part us for ever, we that's so long parted.
Judge, mavourneen, forgive him, forgive him, my lord,
An' God will forgive you-Oh, don't say the word!"
That was the first minute that O'Brien was shaken,
When he saw that he was not quite forgot or forsaken;
An' down his pale cheeks, at the word of his mother,
The big tears wor runnin' fast, one afther th' other;
An' two or three times he endeavoured to spake,
But the sthrong manly voice used to falther and break;
But at last, by the strength of his high-mounting pride,
He conquer'd and masther'd his grief's swelling tide,
“An'," says he, “mother, darlin', don't break your poor heart,
For, sooner or later, the dearest must part;
And all know it's betther than wandering in fear
On the bleak, trackless mountain, among the wild deer,
To lie in the grave, where the head, heart, and breast,
From thought, labour, and sorrow for ever shall rest.
Then, mother, my darlin', don't cry any more,
Don't make me seem broken, in this, my last hour:
For I wish, when my head's lyin' undher the raven,
No thrue man can say that I died like a craven!"

Then towards the judge Shamus bent down his head,
An' that minute the solemn death sentence was said.
The mornin' was bright, and the mists rose on high,
An' the lark whistled merrily in the clear sky,
But why are the men standin' idle so late?
And why do the crowds gather fast in the strate?
What come they to talk of? what come they to see?
An' why does the long rope hang from the cross-tree?
O Shamus O'Brien! pray fervent and fast;
May the saints take your soul, for this day is your last;
Pray fast and pray sthrong, for the moment is nigh,
When, sthrong, proud, and great as you are you must die.
An' fasther, an' fasther, the crowd gather'd there,
Boys, horses, and gingerbread, just like a fair;
An' whisky was sellin', and cussamuck too,
An' ould men an' young women enjoyin' the view.
An' ould Tim Mulvany, he med the remark,
There wasn't sich a sight since the time of Noah's ark.
An' be gorry, 'twas thrue for him, for divil sich a scruge,
Sich divarshin and crowds, was known since the deluge;
For thousands were gather'd there, if there was one,
Waiting till such time as the hangin' 'id come on,
At last they threw open the big prison gate,
An' out came the sheriffs and sodgers in state,
An' a cart in the middle, an' Shamus was in it,
Not paler, but prouder than ever, that minute.
An' soon as the people saw Shamus O'Brien,
Wid prayin' and blessin' and all the girls cryin',
A wild wailing sound kem on by degrees,
Like the sound of the lonesome wind blowing through trees.
On, on to the gallows the sheriffs are gone,
An' the cart an' the sodgers go steadily on;
An' at every side swellin' around of the cart,
A wild, sorrowful sound, that 'id open your heart.
Now under the gallows the cart takes its stand,
And the hangman gets up with the rope in his hand;
An' the priest, havin' blest him, goes down on the ground,
An' Shamus O'Brien throws one last look round.
Then the hangman dhrew near, an' the people grew still,
Young faces turn'd sickly, and warm hearts turn chill;
An' the
rope bein' ready, his neck was made bare,
For the gripe iv the life-strangling chord to prepare;
An' the good priest has left him, havin' said his last prayer.

But the good priest done more, for his hands he unbound,
And with one daring spring Jim has leapt on the ground;
Bang! bang! go the carbines, and clash go the sabres ;
He's not down! he's alive still! now stand to him neigh-
bours !
Through the smoke and the horses he's into the crowd, -
By St. Janus, he's free!-than thunder more loud,
By one shout from the people the heavens were shaken,-
One shout that the dead of the world might awaken.
The sodgers ran this way, the sheriffs ran that,
And Father Malone lost his new Sunday hat;
To-night be'll be sleepin' in Aherloe Glin,
An' bad luck 's in the dice if you catch him ag’in.
Your swords they may glitter, your carbines go bang,

But if you want hangin' it's yourself you must hang.

It stood in the artist's studio: all Florence came to look at
it, all examined it with curiosity, all admired it with eager-
ness, all pronounced it the capo ď opera of Donatello. The
whole town were in raptures; and lovely ladies, as they bent
from their carriages to answer the salutes of the Princes and
Dukes (instead of the common-place frivolities of fashion),
said, “ Have you seen the new statue by Donatello?"
Is there an art like that of sculpture? Painting is a
brilliant illusion-a lovely cheat. Sculpture, while it repre-
sents a reality, is itself a reality. The pencil pours its fervid
hues upon perishable canvass, and they fade with the passing
air; but the chisel works in eternal marble-strikes out a
creation immortal as the globe, and beautiful as the soul.
“I told thee, Donatello,” said Lorenzo, “thou would'st
excel all thy rivals!”
“Fling by thy chisel now," cried another, “ thou canst add
nothing to that?"
“I shall cease, hereafter, my devotion to the antique!" cried
a third.
The
power
of Phidias !” exclaimed one.
« The execution of Praxiteles !” said another.
“ You will draw votaries from Venus," whispered a soft
Italian girl, as she turned her melting eyes on the old man.
“ The Apollo will hereafter draw his bow unheeded !" cried
an artist, whom many thought the best of his day.

Among the crowds who flocked to the studio of Donatello,
there was a youth who had given some promise of excellence.
Many said that, with intense study, he might one day make
his name heard beyond the Alps; and some went so far as to
hint, that in time he might tread close on the heels even of
Donatello himself: but these were sanguine men, and great
friends of the young man; besides, they spoke at random.-
They called this student Michael Angelo.
He had stood a long time regarding it with fixed eyes and
folded arms. He walked from one position to another,
measured it with his keen glances from head to foot, regarded
it before, behind, and studied its profiles from various points.
The venerable Donatello saw him, and awaited his long and
absorbed examination, with the flattered pride of an artist,
and the affectionate indulgence of a father. At length Michael
Angelo stopped once more before it; inhaled a long breath,
and broke the profound silence. “It wants only one thing,”
muttered the gifted boy.
“ Tell me," cried the successful artist, “ what it wants.
This is the first censure which my St. George has elicited.
Can I improve? Can I alter? Is it in the clay or the marble?
Tell me!”
But the critic had disappeared.
Donatello knew the mighty genins of Michael Angelo. He
had beheld the flashes of the sacred fire, and watched the
development of the spirit within him.
“ What !" cried the old man, “ Michael Angelo gone to
Rome, and not a word of advice about my statue The
scape-grace! but I shall see him again, or, by the mass, I
will follow him to the eternal city. His opinion is worth
that of all the world! But one thing !" He looked at it
again-he listened to the murmurs of applause which it drew
from all who beheld it- -a placid smile settled on his face.
“ But one thing—what can it be?”
Years rolled by. Michael Angelo remained at Rome, or
made excursions to other places, but had not yet returned to
Florence. Wherever he had been, men regarded him as a
comet--something fiery, terrible, tremendous, sublime. His
fame spread over the globe; what his chisel touched it hal-
lowed. He spurned the dull clay, and struck his vast and
intensely brilliant conceptions at once from the marble.
Michael Angelo was a name to worship-a spell in the arts-
an honour to Italy—to the world. What he praised, lived;
what he condemned, perished.
As Donatello grew old, his anxiety grew more powerful to

know what the inspired eyes of the wonderful artist had
detected in his great statue.
At length the immortal Florentine turned his eyes to his
native republic, and, as he reached the summit of the hill
which rises on the side of Porta Romana, he beheld the
magnificent and glorious dome, and Campanile, shining in the
soft golden radiance of the setting sun, with the broad-topped
tower of the Palazzo Vecchio lifted in the yellow light, even
as at this day it stands.
Ah, death! can no worth ward thee? Must the inspired
artist's eyes be dark, his hand motionless, his heart still, and
his inventive brain as dull as the clay he models? Yes!
Donatello lies stretched on his last couch, and the light of
life is passing from his eyes; yet even in that awful hour, his
thoughts ran on the wishes of his past years, and he sent for
the Florentine artist. His friend came instantly.
“I am going, Michael, my chisel is idle,-my vision is
dim; but I feel thy hand, my noble boy, and I hear thy kind
breast sob. I glory in thy renown; I predicted it, and I
bless my Creator that I have lived to see it; but before I
sink into the tomb, I charge thee, on thy friendship; on thy
religion answer my question truly.”
“ As I am a man, I will.”
“Then tell me (without equivocation) what it is that my
St. George wants ?”
“ The gift of speech !” was the reply.
A gleam of sunshine fell across the old man's face. The
smile lingered on his lips long after he lay cold as the marble
upon which he had so often stamped the conceptions of his
genius.

the exterior of the Chiesa d'or San Micheles.--Scottish Annual.

Neither my place, nor aught I heard of business,
Hath raised me from my bed; nor doth the general care
Take hold on me; for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,
And it is still itself.
Duke. Why, what's the matter?
Bra. My daughter! O, my daughter!
Duke. Dead?
Bra. Ay, to me;
She is abused, stolen from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebankes :
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not-
Duke. Whoe'er he be, that in this foul proceeding,
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself,
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,
After your own sense; yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.
Bra. Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor; whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate, for the state affairs,
Hath hither brought.
Duke. We are very sorry for it.
What, in your own part, can you say to this?
[To Othello.]
Bra. Nothing, but this is so.
Oth. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta’en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her;
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Řude am I in my speech,
And little bless'd with the set phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now, some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field;
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
In speaking for myself; yet by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,

What conjuration, and what mighty magic,
(For such proceedings I am charged withal,)
I won his daughter with.
Bra. A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, everything,
To fall in love with what she feared to look on !
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect,
That will confess-perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature; and must be driven
To find out practices of foul perdition,
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again,
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.
Duke. To vouch this is no proof,
Without more certain and more overt test,
Than these thin habits, and poor
likelihoods
Of modern seeming, do prefer against him.
1 Sen. But, Othello, speak :
Did you, by indirect and forced courses,
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections ?
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?
Oth. I do beseech you,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
And let her speak of me before ber father;
If you do find me foul in her report,
The trust, the office, I do hold of you,
Not only take away, but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life.
Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither.
Oth. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
(Exeunt Iago and Attendants.]
And, till she come, as truly as to Heaven
I do confess the vices of
my blood,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
And she in mine.

I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it.
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field;
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the eminent deadly breach;
Of being taken by the insolent foe,
And sold to slavery; of my redemption thence,
And portance in my travel's history.
These things to hear,
Would Desdemona seriously incline;
But still the house affairs would draw her thence;
Which ever as she could with haste despatch,
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour; and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively; I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffered. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore,-in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange;
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful :
She wish'd she had not heard it; yet she wish'd
That Heaven had made her such a man : she thank'd me,
And bade me if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint, I spake;
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd;
And I loved her, that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used;
Here comes the lady, let her witness it.
Enter DESDEMONA.
Duke. I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,
Take up this mangled matter at the best ;
Men do their broken weapons rather use,
Than their bare hands.

If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress !

OUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOURS.
They were a young lad of eighteen or nineteen, and his
mother, a lady of about fifty, or it might be less. The mother
wore a widow's weeds, and the boy was also clothed in deep
mourning. They were poor-very poor; for their only means
of support arose from the pittance the boy earned by copying
writings for booksellers.
They had removed from some country place and settled in
London ; partly because it afforded better chances of employ-
ment for the boy, and partly, perhaps, with the natural desire
to leave a place where they had been in better circumstances,
and where their poverty was known. They were proud
under their reverses, and above revealing their wants and
privations to strangers. How bitter those privations were,
and how hard the boy worked to remove them, no one ever
knew but themselves. Night after night-two, three, four
hours after midnight-could we hear the occasional raking
up of the scanty fire, or the hollow or half-stified cough,

which indicated his being still at work; and day after day,
could we see more plainly that nature had set that unearthly
light in his plaintive face which is the beacon of her worst
disease.
Actuated, we hope, by a higher feeling than mere curiosity,
we contrived to establish, first an acquaintance, and then a
close intimacy, with the poor strangers. Our worst fears
were realized; the boy was sinking fast. Through a part of
the winter, and the whole of the following spring, the mother
attempted to procure needlework embroidery-anything for
bread.
A few shillings now and then, were all she could earn.
The boy worked steadily on; dying by minutes, but never
once giving utterance to complaint or murmur.
One beautiful autumn evening we went to pay our custom-
ary visit to the invalid. His little remaining strength had
been decreasing rapidly for two or three days preceding, and
he was lying on the sofa at the open window, gazing at the
setting sun. His mother had been reading the Bible to
him, for she closed the book as we entered, and advanced to.
meet us.
“I was telling William,” she said, " that we must manage
to take him into the country somewhere, so that he may get
quite well. He is not ill, you know, but he is not very
strong, and has exerted himself too much lately.” Poor
thing! The tears that streamed through her fingers, as she
turned aside, too plainly shewed how fruitless was the attempt
to deceive herself.
We sat down by the head of the sofa, but said nothing,
for we saw the breath of life was passing gently, but rapidly
from the young form before us. At every respiration, his
heart beat more slowly.
The boy placed one hand in ours, grasped his mother's
arm with the other, drew her hastily towards him, and
fervently kissed her cheek. There was a pause. He sunk
back upon his pillow, and looked long and earnestly in his
mother's face.
William, William !” murmured the mother after a long
interval, “ don't look at me so-speak to me, dear.”
The boy smiled languidly, but an instant afterwards his
features resolved into the same cold, solemn gaze.
William, dear William ! rouse yourself, dear; don't look
at me so, love-pray don't! Alas! alas ! what shall I do!”
cried the widow, clasping her hands in agony—“my dear boy!
he is dying!"

The boy raised himself by a violent effort, and folded his
hands together—"Mother! dear, dear mother, bury me in
the open fields—anywhere but in these dreadful streets. I
should like to be where you can see my grave, but not in
these close crowded streets; they have killed me; kiss me
again, mother; put your arm round my neck—”
He fell back, and a strange expression stole upon his
features; not of pain or suffering, but an indescribable fixing
of every line and muscle.
THE BOY WAS DEAD.
MAUD MÜLLER.
MAUD MÜLLER, on a summer's day,
Raked the meadows sweet with hay.
Beneath her torn hat glow'd the wealth
Of simple beauty and rustic health.
Singing, she wrought, and a merry glee
The mock-bird echo'd from his tree.
But, when she glanced to the far-off town,
White from its hill-slope looking down,
The sweet song died, and a vague unrest
And a nameless longing fill'd her breast-
A wish that she hardly dared to own,
For something better than she had known.
The Judge rode slowly down the lane,
Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane.
He drew his bridle in the shade
Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,
And ask a draught from the spring that flow'd
Through the meadows across the road.
She stoop'd where the cool stream bubbl’d up,
And filled for him her small tin cup,
And blush'd as she gave it, looking down
On her feet so bare, and her tatter'd gown.
“ Thanks!” said the Judge, "a sweeter draught
From a fairer hand was never quaff’d.”

He spoke of the grass, and flowers, and trees,
Of the singing birds and the humming bees;
Then talked of the haying, and wonder'd whether
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.
And Maud forgot her briar-torn gown,
And her graceful ankles bare and brown;
And listen'd, while a pleased surprise
Look'd from her long-lashed hazel eyes.
At last, like one who for delay
Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away.
Maud Müller looked and sigh'd: “Ah me!
That I the Judge's bride might be!
“ He would dress me up in silks so fine,
And praise me at his toast and wine.
“My father should wear a broad-cloth coat:
My brother should sail a painted boat.
“I'd dress my mother so grand and gay,
And the baby should have a new toy each day.
“ And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor;
And all should bless me who left our door."
The Judge look'd back as he climb'd the hill,
And saw Maud Müller standing, still.
“ A form more fair a face more sweet,
Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.
“ And her modest answer and graceful air,
Shew her wise and good as she is fair.
“Would she were mine, and I to-day
Like her a harvester of hay:
“No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,
And weary lawyers with endless tongues,
“ But low of cattle and song of birds,
And health of quiet and loving words.”
But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold,
And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.

So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,
And Maud was left in the field alone.

But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,
When he humm'd in court an old love tunc;
And the young girl mused beside the well,
Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.
He wedded a wife of richest dower,
Who lived for fashion, as he for power.
Yet oft, in his marble bearth's bright glow,
He watch'd a picture come and go:
And sweet Maud Müller's hazel eyes
Look'd out in their innocent surprise.
Oft when the wine in his glass was red,
He long'd for the wayside well instead.
And closed his eyes on his garnish'd rooms,
To dream of meadows and clover blooms.
And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain;
“Ah, that I were free again!
“ Free as when I rode that day,
Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay."
She wedded a man unlearned and
poor,
And many children played round her door.
But care and sorrow, and racking pain,
Left their traces on heart and brain.

And oft, when the summer sun shone hot
On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,
And she heard the little spring-brook fall
Over the roadside, through the wall,
In the shade of the apple-tree again
She saw a rider draw his rein:
And, gazing down with timid grace,
She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
Stretch'd away into stately halls; ;

And therefore lost that title of respect,
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

King. Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye;
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory;
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us: when we need
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.

But I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd,
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd,
Shew'd like a stubble-land at a harvest home:
He was perfumed like a milliner;
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose, and took't away again;
And still he smil'd, and talk’d:
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
He call'd them—untaught knaves, unmannerly,
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He question'd me; among the rest, demanded
My prisoners, in your majesty's behalf.

To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
Out of my grief and my impatience,
Answered neglectingly, I know not what:
He should, or he should not; for he made me mad,
To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,
Of guns, and drums, and wounds,-heaven save the mark !
And telling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was sparmaceti for an inward bruise;

Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,

At such a time, with all the rest re-told,
May reasonably die, and never rise
To do him wrong, or any way impeach
What he then said, so he unsay

King. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners;
But with proviso and exception,-
That we, at our own charge, shall ransom straight
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against the great magician, bold Glendower;
Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
Shall we buy treason ? and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves ?
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
For I shall never hold that man my friend,
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
But by the chance of war: to prove that true,
Needs no more but one tongue; forall those wounds,
Those mouth'd wounds, which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
In single opposition, hand to hand,
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
Three times they breath’d, and three times they did drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;

Name, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don't know
that everybody else has two names. Never heerd of sich a

Thinks it long enough for him. He don't find no fault with

he's dead, if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here, but believes
it'll be something very bad to punish him, and serve him
right- and so he'll tell the truth.
That graceless creature only knows that the dead man
(whom he recognized just now by his yellow face and black
hair) was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets.
That one cold winter night, when he, the boy, was shivering
in a doorway near his crossing, the man turned to look at
him, and came back, and, having questioned him and found
he had not a friend in the world, said, “Neither have I. Not
one!” and gave him the price of a supper and a night's
lodging. That the man had often spoken to him since; and
asked him whether he slept sound at night, and how he bore
cold and hunger, and whether he ever wished to die, and
similar strangè questions. That when the man had no money,
he would say in passing, “I am as poor as you to-day,
Jo;" but that when he had any, he would always (as the boy
most heartily believes) been glad to give him some.
“He wos wery good to me,” says the boy, wiping his eyes:
with his wretched sleeve. “ Wen I see him a-layin' so
stritched out just now, I wished he could have heerd me tell
. him so.
He wos wery good to me, he wos!"
With the night comes a slouching figure through the
tunnel-court, to the outside of the iron gate of the churchyard.
It holds the gate with its hands, and looks in between the
bars; stands looking in for a little while.
It then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step,
and makes the archway clean. It does so very busily and
trimly; looks in again, a little while; and so departs, mutter-

the manner of his tribe in a difficulty, sideways against the
boarding, resting one of his high shoulders against it, and
covertly rubbing his right hand over his left, and his left foot
over his right.
“You hear what she says, and I know it's true. Have
you been here ever since?”
“Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all-Alone's till this blessed
morning,'' replies Jo, hoarsely.
“ Why have you come here now?"
Jo looks all around the confined court, looks at his
questioner no higher than the knees, and finally answers :
“I don't know how to do nothink, and I can't get nothink
to do. I'm wery poor and ill, and I thought I'd come back
here when there warn't nobody about, and lay down and hide
somewheres as I knows on till arter dark, and then go and
bég a trifle of Mr. Snagsby. He wos allus willing fur to give
me somethink, he was, though Mrs. Snagsby she wus allus a
chivying on me-like everybody everywheres."
“ Where have you come from?”
“ Aye!” says Allan. · Why, what have you been
doing ?”
“ Nothink, sir. Never done nothink to get myself into no
trouble, 'cept in not moving on and the Inkwhich. But I'm
a-moving on now. I'm a-moving on to the berrying ground-
that's the move as I'm up to.”
“Now, Jo," says Allan, keeping his eye upon him, “come
with me, and I will find you a better place than this to lie
down and hide in.
Jo takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt,
close to the houses on the opposite side of the street. In this
order the two came up out of Tom-all-Alone's into the broad
rays of the sunlight and the purer air. .
A breakfast-stall at a street corner suggests the first thing
to be done. What is a dainty repast to Jo is then set be-
fore him, and he begins to gulp the coffee, and to gnaw the
bread-and-butter, looking anxiously about him in all directions
as he eats and drinks, like a scared animal.
But he is so sick and miserable, that even hunger has
abandoned him. “I thought I was a-inost a-starvin, sir,” says
Jo, soon putting down his food; “but I don't no nothink-not
even that. I don't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking
on 'em.” And Jo stands shivering, and looking at the break-
fast wonderingly.
Allan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse, and on his
chest. “Draw breath, Jo!" "It draws," says Jo, "as heavy

as a cart.” He might add, “and rattles like it; “but he only
mutters, “I'm a-moving on, sir.”
For the cart so hard to draw, is near its journey's end, and
drags over stony ground. Not many times can the sun rise,
and behold it still
upon
its
weary
road.

Jo is in a sleep, or in a stupor to-day, and Allan Woodcourt,
newly arrived, stands by him, looking down upon his wasted
form. After a while, he softly seats himself upon the bedside
with his face towards him, and touches his chest and heart.
The cart had very nearly given up, but labours on a little
more.
>
“Well, Jo! what is the matter? Don't be frightened.”
“I thought,” says Jo, who was started and is looking
round, “I thought I was in Tom-all-Alone's agin. Ain't
there nobody here but you, Mr. Woodcot?”
"Nobody."
“And I ain't took back to Tom-all-Alone's. Am I, sir?"
"No." Jo closes his eyes, muttering, “I'm wery thankful.”
After watching him closely a little while, Allan puts his
mouth very near his ear, and says to him in a low distinct
voice:
“Jo! Did you ever know a prayer?”
“ Never knowd nothink, sir."
“ Not so much as one short prayer?"
“No, sir. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands he wos a-prayin
wunst at Mr. Snagsby's, and I heerd him; but he sounded as
if he wos a-speakin' to hisself, and not to me. He prayed a
lot, but I couldn't make out nothink on it. Different times,
there was other gen'lmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin,
but they all mostly sed as the t'ther wuns prayed wrong, and
all mostly sounded to be a-talking to theirselves, or a-passing
blame on the t'thers, and not a-talkin to us. We never
knowd
nothink. I never knowd what it was all about."
It takes him a long time to say this : and few but an
experienced and attentive listener could hear, or, hearing, un-
derstand him. After a short relapse into sleep or stupor, he
makes, of a sudden, a strong effort to get out of bed.
• Stay, Jo. What now?"
“It's time for me to go to that there berryin' ground, sir,”
be returns with a wild look.
“ Lie down, and tell me what berryin' ground, Jo!"
“Where they laid him as wos wery good to me, wery good
to me, indeed he was. It's time fur me to go down to that
there berryin' ground, sir, and ask to be put along with him.

I wants to go there and be berried. He used fur to say to
me,
I am as poor as you to-day, Jo, he says. I wants to tell
him that I am as poor as him now, and have come there to
be laid along with him.”'
“By-and-by, Jo. By-and-by.”
"Ah! P'raps they wouldn't do it if I was to go myself.
But will you promise to have me took there, sir, and laid along
with him.”
“I will, indeed.”
“ Thank’ee, sir. "They 'll have to get the key of the gate

Fast. The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road
is very near it's end.

Bass. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me?
Shall I know your answer?
Shy. Three thousand ducats, for three months, and Antonio
bound.
Bass. Your answer to that.
Shy. Antonio is a good man.
Bass. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary.
Shy. Oh! no, no, no, no;-my meaning, in saying he is a
good man, is to have you understand me, that he is sufficient;
yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to
Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon
the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England,
and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats, water-
rats, water-thieves, and land-thieves—I mean, pirates; and
then, there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.— The
man is, notwithstanding, sufficient:--three thousand ducats:-
I think I may take his bond.
Bass. Be assured you may.
Shy. I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
I will bethink me.
May I speak with Antonio?
Bass. If it please you to dine with us.
Shy. Yes, to smell pork! to eat of the habitation which
your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I will
buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you,
and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with
you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto?– Who
is he who comes here?
Enter ANTONIO.
Bass. This is Signior Antonio.
Shy. [Aside.] How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him, for he is a Christian:
But more, for that, in low simplicity,
He lends out money gratis, and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest: Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!
Bass. Shylock, do you
hear?
Shy. I am debating of my present store;

And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats: What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft: how many months
Do you desire?—Rest you fair, good signior:
[To Antonio.]
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
Ant. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow,
By taking, nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom :-Is he yet possessed.
How much you would?
Shy. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
Ant. And for three months.
Shy. I had forgot,-three months, you told me so.
Well, then, your bond ; and, let me see—but hear you:
Methought you said, you neither lend, nor borrow,
Upon advantage.
Ant. I do never use it.
Shy. Three thousand ducats,—'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.
Ant. 'Well, Shylock, shall we be beholden to you?
Shy. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft,
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my monies, and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug:
For suffrance is the badge of all our tribe:
You call me-misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well, then, it now appears, you need my help:
Go to then; you come to me, and you say,
Shylock, we would have monies; You say so:
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold; monies is your suit.
What should I say to you? Should I not say,
Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? or
Shall I bend low, and in a bondsman's key,
With 'bated breath, and whispering humbleness,
Say this,
Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last,
You spurn'd me such a day; another time,

you storm!
You called me-dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much monies.
Ant. I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friend; (for when did friendship take
A breed of barren metal of his friend ?)
But lend it rather to thine
enemy;
Who, if he break, thou may’st with better face
Exact the penalty.
Shy. Why, look you,
,
how
I would be friends with you, and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants, and take no doit
Of usance for my monies, and you 'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.
Ant. This were kindness.
Shy. This kindness will I shew:-
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond ; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum, or sums, as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
Ant. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
And say, there is much kindness in a Jew.
Bass. You shall not seal to such a bond for me,
I'd rather dwell in my necessity.
Ant. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
Shy. 0, Father Abraham! what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them to suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this:
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man,
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so: if not, adieu :
And, for my love, I pray you, wrong me not.

Ant. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
Shy. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond.
And I will go and purse the ducats straight:
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave; and presently
I will be with you.
[Exit.]
Ant. Hie thee, gentle Jew.
This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
Bass. I like not fair terms, and a villain's mind,
Ant. Come on; in this there can be no dismay,
My ships come home a month before the day. (Exeunt.]

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.
[By kind permission of ROBERT BROWNING, Esq.]
HAMELIN Town's in Brunswick,
By famous Hanover city;
The river Weser, deep and wide,
Washes its wall on the southern side;
A pleasanter spot you never spied;
But, when begins my ditty,
Almost five hundred years ago,
To see the townsfolk suffer so
From vermin was a pity.
Rats!
They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
And even spoiled the women's chats,
By drowning their speaking
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.
At last the people in a body
To the Town Hall came flocking:
66 'Tis clear,” cried they, “our Mayor's a noddy;
And as for our Corporation-shocking

To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
For dolts that can't or won't determine
What's best to rid us of our vermin!
You hope, because you're old and obese,
To find in the furry civic robe ease?
Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking,
To find the remedy we're lacking,
Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!”
At this the Mayor and Corporation
Quaked with a mighty consternation.
An hour they sate in council,
At length the Mayor broke silence:
“ For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;
I wish I were a mile hence!
It's easy to bid one rack one's brain-
I'm sure my poor head aches again
I've scratched it so, and all in vain,
Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!"
Just as he said this, what should hap
At the chamber door but a gentle tap?
“Bless us,” cried the Mayor, “what's that!”
(With the Corporation as he sat,
Looking little though wondrous fat;
Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister,
Than a too-long-opened oyster,
Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous
For a plate of turtle green and glutinous),
Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?
Anything like the sound of a rat
Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"
-
a
“Come in!”--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:
And in did come the strangest figure.
His queer long coat from heel to head
Was half of yellow and half of red;
And he himself was tall and thin,
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,
And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,
But lips where smiles went out and in-
There was no guessing his kith and kin!
And nobody could enough admire
The tall man and his quaint attire :
Quoth one: “It's as my great-grandsire,

Had walked this way from his painted tombstone."

He adyanced to the council-table:
And, “ Please your honours,” said he “I'm able,
By means of a secret charm, to draw
All creatures living beneath the sun,
That creep, or swim, or fly, or run
After me so as you never saw!
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm,
The mole, and toad, and newt, and viper;
And people call me the Pied Piper.
(And here they noticed round his neck
A scarf of red and yellow stripe,
To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;
And at the scarf-end's hung a pipe;
And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying
As if impatient to be playing
Upon this pipe, as low it dangled
Over his vesture so old-fangled.)
Yet,” said he, “poor piper as I am,
In Tartary I freed the Cham,
Last June, from his huge swarm of gnats;
I eased in Asia the Nizam
Of a monstrous brood of vampire bats :
And, as for what your brain bewilders,
If I can rid your town of rats
Will you give me a thousand guilders?”
“One ? fifty thousand !”—was the exclamation
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
Into the street the Piper stept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept
In his quiet pipe the while;
Then, like a musical adept,
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, -
And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled
Like a candle flame where salt is sprinkled;
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,
You heard as if an army muttered;
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
And out of the house the rats came tumbling.

Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers.
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,
Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives-
Followed the Piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped advancing,
And step for step they followed dancing,
Until they came to the river Weser
Wherein all plunged and perished
- Save one, who, stout as Julius Cæsar,
Swam across and lived to carry
(As he the manuscript he cherished)
To Rat-land home his commentary,
Which
was,
“At the first shrill notes of the pipe,
I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,
And putting apples, wondrous ripe,
Into à cider-press's gripe;
And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,
And a leaving ajar of conserve cupboards,
And a drawing the corks of train-oil flasks.
And a breaking the hoops of butter casks;
And it seemed as if a voice
(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery,
Is breathed) called out, Oh! rats, rejoice!
The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
To munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,
Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!
And just as a bulky sugar puncheon,
All ready staved, like a great sun shone
Glorious scarce an inch before me,
Just as methought it said, come, bore me!
- I found the Weser rolling o'er me.”

“Go,” cried the Mayor, “ and get long poles !
Poke out the nests and block up the holes !
Consult with carpenters and builders,
And leave in our town not even a trace
Of the rats!”—when suddenly up the face
Of the Piper perked in the market-place,
With a “FIRST, IF YOU PLEASE, MY THOUSAND GUILDERS!”

A thousand guilders? The Mayor looked blue;
So did the Corporation too.
For council dinners made rare havock
With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;
And half the money would replenish
Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.
To pay this sum to a wandering fellow
With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!
“Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,
“ Our business was done at the river's brink;
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.
So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink
From the duty of giving you something to drink,
And a matter of money to put in your poke;
But, as for the guilders, what we spoke
Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.
Beside, our losses have made us thrifty;
A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!
The piper's face fell, and he cried,
“No trifling! I can't wait, beside !
I've promised to visit by dinner-time
Bagdat, and accepted the prime
Of the Head Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,
For having left in the Caliph's kitchen,
Of a nest of scorpions no survivor-
With him I proved no bargain-driver,
With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!
And folks who put me in a passion
May find me pipe to another fashion.”
“How?” cried the Mayor, “d'ye think I'll brook
Being worse treated than a Cook ?
Insulted by a lazy ribald
With idle pipe and vesture piebald ?
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,
Blow your pipe there till
you
burst!”
Once more he stept into the street;
And to his lips again
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet
Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
Never gave the enraptured air)

THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.
111
There was a rustling, that seemed like a bustling
Of merry crowds justling, at pitching and hustling,
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,
And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,
Out came the children running.
All the little boys and girls,
With
rosy
cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter,
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood
As if they were changed into blocks of wood,
Unable to move a step, or cry
To the children merrily skipping by
And could only follow with the eye
That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
But how the Mayor was on the rack,
And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,
As the Piper turned from the High Street
To where the Weser rolled its waters
Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
However he turned from South to West,
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,
And after him the children pressed;
Great was the joy in every breast.
“ He never can cross that mighty top!
He's forced to let the piping drop,
And we shall see our children stop!”
When lo, as they reached the mountain's side,
A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
And the Piper advanced and the children followed,
And when all were in to the very last,
The door in the mountain side shut fast.
Did I
say
all ? No! one was lame,
And could not dance the whole of the way;
And in after years, if you would blame
His sadness, he was used to say,
“It's dull in our town since my playmates left;
I can't forget that I'm bereft
Of all the pleasant sights they see.
Which the Piper also promised me;
For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,

Joining the town and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
And everything was strange and new;
The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,
And their dogs outran our fallow deer,
And honey-bees had lost their stings;
And horses were born with eagle's wings;
And just as I became assured
My lame foot would be speedily cured,
The music stopped and I stood still,
And found myself outside the Hill,
Left alone against my will,
To go now limping as before,
And never hear of that country more!"

a
Alas, alas, for Hamelin !
There came into many a burgher's pate
A text which says, that Heaven's Gate
Opes to the Rich at as easy rate
As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South
To offer the Piper by word of mouth,
Wherever it was men's lot to find him,
Silver and gold to his heart's content,
If he'd only return the way he went,
And bring the children behind him.
But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,
And Piper and dancers were gone
for
ever,
They made a decree that lawyers never,
Should think their records dated duly
If, after the day of the month and year,
These words did not as well appear,
“ And so long after what happened here
On the twenty-second of July,
Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:'
And the better in memory to fix
The place of the children's last retreat,
They called it, the Pied Piper's street-
Where any one playing on pipe or tabor,
Was sure for the future to lose his labour.
Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
To shock with mirth a street so solemn;

They wrote the story on a column,

And on the great church window painted
The same, to make the world acquainted
How their children were stolen away;
And there it stands to this very day.
And I must not omit to say
That in Transylvania there's a tribe
Of alien people that ascribe
The outlandish
ways
and dress
On which their neighbours lay such stress,
To their fathers and mothers having risen
Out of some subterraneous prison
Into which they were trepanned
Long time ago in a mighty band
Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,
But how or why they don't understand.
So, Willy, let you and me be wipers
Of scores out with all men-especially pipers:
And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,
If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.
A STRANGE PROPOSAL.
[By kind permission of CHARLES MATHEWS, Esq.]
SIR CHARLES COLDSTREAM. LADY CLUTTERBUCK
Lady C. Sir Charles Coldstream, I presume. I have not
I
the pleasure of knowing you, and I believe you have not the
honour of knowing me.
Sir C. [A side.] A good beginning.– [Aloud.] May I take
the liberty of enquiring, madam—but pardon me--first, I
believe, you are a widow?
Lady C. Yes, sir.-[Aside.] How very odd !
Sir C. Then permit me to offer you a chair.—[Aside.] I

Lady C. Sir Charles, we will proceed to business.

Sir C. Might I ask, madam--we are neighbours, I believe!
Lady.C. My house is close to yoursma mere cottage, but I
remain there with pleasure, as it was there I lost my poor
husband.
Sir C. I understand, the pleasures of memory;--and have
we bachelors suffered for any length of time the disgrace of
your widowhood ?
Lady C. Sir!
Sir C. I say, madam, is it long that you have enjoyed your
misfortune?
Lady C. Oh, a considerable period.
Sir C. A good match, the lamented Clutterbuck?
Lady C. Åh-h, sir, Í have been wedded twice. My first,
poor Ironbrace, wooed me from a flourishing business in town.

Sir C. Good?
Lady C. No, sir, wealthy; while I had nothing to offer him,

Sir C. Ah! little enough!
Lady C. Sir!
Sir C. I simply remarked, that in this money-making age,
mere virtue-unfortunately—but pray proceed.
Lady C. Three months after marriage, news reached me of
his death. I immediately quitted London with what fortune
I possessed, to hide my tears at a watering-place, where I met
Sir Stephen Clutterbuck, a little wizen old gentleman, who
wore powder; but one couldn't look upon that as a physical
objection, you know, sir-
Sir C. On the contrary, madam.
Lady C. He offered me his hand and heart a heart of five-

Sir C. Just now, you said he had a carriage.
Lady C. So he had, but no horses—'twas only jobbed.
Sir C. Oh, Corpo di Bacco,-then 'twas a swindle!
Lady C. He soothed my indignation-for he had a good
heart withal-by making me the only atonement in his
power.
Sir C. I see he left the country.
Lady C. No, he died.
Sir C. That was rather handsome of him.
Lady C. Yes. However, notwithstanding his behaviour, I
mourned him the regular time.
Sir C. It does honour to your head and heart, madam.
Lady C. [She rises.] But in your delightful conversation, I
forgot the object of my visit.
Sir C. [Puts chairs up.] Your pardon: my steward will give
you a check for twenty guineas.
Lady C. You are generosity itself.
Sir C. Not at all.
Lady C. Good morning, Sir Charles.
Sir C. Permit me; delighted to have made the acquaint-

Lady C. [Looks astonished.] Oh, Sir Charles !
Sir C. I never pay compliments; but of all the women I
ever adored, (that is, the days when I did adore,) out of about
two hundred, I may say, who have possessed my heart, there
were several who could not in justice compare with you.

Sir C. Do me the favour to look at me-observe me criti-

the question is indelicate;—but if that comet still existed, we
should be precisely of the same age.

Sir C. No, madam; I and the comet.

Sir C. It was, madam.
Lady C. Oh!
Sir C. Madam, I am by nature melancholy.
Lady C. You? Why you have been saying all manner of
funny things to me this half hour.
Sir C. You are mistakon : they were melancholy truths,
positively. Why, 'twas only last week I made my will, left
all my property amongst some friends, who are now on a visit
here, before I carried out a fancy I had entertained for some
time of hanging myself on a tree!
Lady C. Hanging yourself on a tree !
Sir C. Or throwing myself into the river: I've a window
here convenient—the water flows to the wall.
Lady C. Oh, you are joking !
Sir C. But since I have seen you my mind is changed : I
have taken another fancy, one in which you can assist me.

Sir C. You! listen: I have a house in town-estates in the
three kingdoms, and one for a freak in the Isle of Man—I've

Sir C. I am, as I have told you, only thirty-three; and
according to the highest female authorities, this cannot be
designated a paw-(Holds out his hand,],—will you accept it?

declaration of love ?
Sir C. Quite the contrary-it is a proposal of marriage.

A STORY A LA MODE.
I am a native of Ireland, and am fifty-three years of age; my
profession is that of a clergyman of the Established Church.
I am a plain and simple man in my customs, and in my
creed
a lover of the truth, no matter where it is sought or upon
what it is based. This statement will, I trust, absolve me
from a superstitious belief, and free me from the necessity of
endeavouring to explain one of those mysterious incidents on
which learning can throw no light, and as to the cause of
which Nature is still silent.
On the 10th of September, 1853, I was travelling on the
Great Northern Railway to a small town in Yorkshire.

weather was miserably cold and wet, and the rain strcamed
down the glass of the carriage windows like a flood of tears.
We had left the King's Cross Terminus at 45 minutes past
8 P.M., and it was now much past midnight. I sat listlessly
with my watch in my hand, mentally calculating how long it
would be ere my journey would be at an end and my mission
fulfilled.
I have stated that I am a minister of the Church of England;
and, amongst the sacred duties of my office, I am sometimes
called
upon to perform even a sadder one than that of attending
the dying bed—I allude to that of bearing the tidings to the
unconscious survivors. It was upon one of these mournful
missions that I was then bound-the more mournful, perhaps,
from the knowledge which I had that the relatives were
expecting the deceased himself instead of his sad messenger.
The deceased had unexpectedly been stricken with fever, and
I had been summoned suddenly to attend his last moments.
To my astonishment I had recognized in his features those
of an old college chum and schoolmate; and in compliance
with his latest request, I was hastening to apprise his family
of the melancholy event-hoping that I might be able to
add words of divine comfort and support; and that God
would be pleased to make me the humble instrument of
leading them, in their first lonely hour of bereavement, to
the resignation which had soothed the last hours of the
departed.
My journey at length came to an end, and I stood upon
the little station at Marketsbury. The guard had remounted
his solitary seat; the farewell shriek of the engine had died
away in the damp night air. I had watched the red, round,
fiery bull's-eye at the back of the last carriage disappear
behind a bend in the road; and the train had resumed its
course through the chilly wind and the lonesome night, when,
upon glancing round, I found I was the only passenger that
had alighted at Marketsbury. The station looked gloomy
enough at that hour, as I was conducted by the porter through
the little office to a door at the further end of it; and still
more miserable did it appear when the door had closed behind
me, and I found myself on a dark and desolate heath at half-
past two o'clock on a cold and rainy morning.
The town of Marketsbury presented anything but a cheering
appearance-a dozen or two of gas-lamps, weak and watery in
the distance, being the only indication I had of its existence.
A large barren common was before me, facing the road on
which I stood; and whether I should turn to the right hand

came.
or to the left, or boldly plunge across the waste, I was in doubt.
The rain came down in torrents, and each moment it increased.
I was already half drenched, and as to the best course to
adopt I was quite undecided. To get a conveyance to
Marketsbury was out of the question, and to walk to the
town in such a deluge, with nothing but the distant gas-lamps
to mark the way, seemed all but an impossibility. Thinking
the station would probably be closed for the night, I deter-
mined to seek some shed in its vicinity, and there remain
till at least the rain had abated or a conveyance could be
procured.
Hopelessly I was passing the station, when I fancied I saw
a small ray of light struggling through the chinks in the door.
Insignificant as it appeared it gave me confidence; and with
my knuckles I rapped at the door without delay. No answer
The sound was borne away on the night wind; and
the rain dripped dismally from the leaden roof into the pools
beneath. As the necessity for seeking the shelter of a shed,
in which to remain for the night, became the more inevitable,
so in proportion did my desire for a more comfortable resting-
place increase. I knocked again this time much louder than
I had knocked before. There was a momentary pause; I then
heard a shuffling of feet, a key was turned sharply, and the
railway porter stood before me.
He was a broad-shouldered, thick-set man, rather above the
middle height than below it, and had a red, round, good-
humoured face—the features of which were, however, all but
obscured by an enormous beard of sandy-coloured hair. He
was also very fat; and the suit of corduroy which he wore
fitted him so tightly, that when he walked he appeared in a
perpetual state of bursting. I remembered his face at once, and
recognized him as the man who had taken my ticket. I had
also heard the policeman call him Proggles.
The man looked with an air of astonishment at receiving a
visitor so late, or rather so early, an hour: and, as he held
the door partly open, began with “ No train till three, sir.”
I could see the office clock from where I stood. It was
half past two already; so, without hesitation, I entered the
little office.
“Going up, sir?" inquired the porter, as he pushed a large,
leather-backed arm-chair towards a stove, in which the embers
of a fire were gradually dying out.
“ No; I am waiting till the rain holds up or until the mail
train arrives, when I may stand a chance of getting a convey-
ance to Marketsbury."

"
“ You're pretty well wet through, sir," said the man, putting
more coals upon the fire, and raking out some of the ashes.
"Take your coat off—a cold's more easily caught than got rid
of.”
Mr. Proggles having raised the gas a little, retired into a
dark corner of the office and was seen no more.
Having divested myself of my wet coat and boots, I sat down
in the old-fashioned chair that the porter had drawn out; and,
throwing my head back, took a survey of my temporary
lodging.
It was furnished in the usual style—the customary number
of life assurance prospectuses hanging upon the walls; the
broad, brown desks, with large flat-bottomed ink-stands; the
pigeon-hole receptacles of the passengers' money; the invari-
able number of bundles, baskets, fishing-rods—left by the
travellers by the last train, or awaiting the arrival of those by
the next;-everything bespeaking a railway station of a little
Yorkshire town. A broad white-faced office-clock was fixed
above the fireplace before which the porter had placed the
chair; on my right hand was the small latticed window at
which the rain was beating; and on my left hand was the
little door through which I had but just now passed.
Fatigued as I was, from having travelled so many hours
without intermission, I imagined there would be little diffi-
culty in gaining repose ;. but in this I was mistaken. A
strange restlessness of mind and body pervaded me; and,
try what I would, I could not bring myself to the quietude
that precedes sleep.
I sat by the office fire watching the coals as they dropped
from one shapeless mass to another; and in their strange
forms I mentally saw old faces, half forgotten; while memory
conjured up many a kindly word and cherished look.
Thoughts of the past glanced rapidly through my mind; the
days of boyhood dwindled into those of age; and I, a gray-
haired man, sat wondering how the time had fled since I and
he whose eyes I had lately closed in death had many a college
laugh and pleasant game. How far into the future my
imagination might have carried me I cannot say; but my
thoughts appeared gradually to resolve themselves into one
strange fancy. My attention became rivetted to the ticking
of the office clock.
Never once in all the wanderings of my mind-while con-
juring up the memories of the past or picturing what joys or
sorrows looked out of the distant future—had I become
entirely lost to its solitary sound; it seemed to share my grief,

.to tune my thoughts; but now, as I buried my head in the
thick horse hair oozing out of the back of my chair, it roused
me—for its tongue appeared to tick (as if uttering the word
uppermost in mind) my dead friend's name! So strong an
impression did it make upon me, that I started up to assure
myself I had not dreamed it. All was quiet within-no
sound broke the stillness but the dripping of the rain on the
window-sill and the ticking of the clock; but the wind rising,
howled a mournful accompaniment over the dreary common.
We had stared at each other (I and the clock) for some time,
when, chancing to look down, I found that I was not alone.
Unobserved by me, Mr. Proggles, the porter, had come out
of his obscure retreat, and, like myself, had his eyes fixed on
the clock. Its broad white face seemed to look down on us,
and its long, thin-pointed hands proclaimed the hour of night.
“ Can't sleep, sir?"
“ You're right. I cannot.”
" 'More can I, sir.”
And having thus delivered himself, Mr. Proggles became
again absorbed in the clock.
The place looked so desolate, and my restlessness so hope-
less, that I thankfully seized on the chance of entering into
conversation.
“ You've not much rest of a night, I suppose.
always being disturbed ?"
“I've pretty much of that, sir," answered Proggles, putting
his shiny cap on one side the better to scratch his head.
“What with one thing, and what with another, I never get
what one may call-a good night's rest.”
“You have a day porter, of course, to relieve you?"
Seeing that I was inclined to converse, Mr. Proggles drew
a very low wooden bench close to the fender, on which he
endeavoured to seat himself. I have before remarked he was
Very corpulent, and that his clothes fitted him tightly. His
efforts, therefore, to lower himself were painful in the extreme;
and why his corduroys did not burst in his efforts is a mystery
I have never yet been able to solve. As his posture was
anything but a comfortable one, either for himself or for me-
his knees being ona par with his whiskers—I remarked, “ You
must be rather confined for room there. I am not at all tired.
Take my chair, whilst I try to warm myself by a turn up and
down the room.”
Mr. Proggles opened his eyes very wide, and gazed at me
for some time, then shook his head, and answered, “ No,
thankee,” most emphatically,
You are

you?"
There was something so earnest in the man's look, and so
strange a determination in his brief reply, that I felt com-
pelled to ask him if he had any objection to the chair.
“No,” he replied; “I haven't no objection; only I'd rather
not.”
After a short pause he resumed—his hands in his pockets
and his eyes upon the ground. “Why, you see, sir- but
mind, I know you 'll laugh at me; leastways, what is to
say the same tiing, you won't believe what I'm going to tell
When I had set Mr. Proggles' mind at rest by assuring
him that I saw no reason to doubt his veracity, and that
my mood was not by any means one for laughter, he
demanded-
“Do you believe in presentments ?”
“In what?"
“In presentments;-a something as comes across you not
of what is a-going on, but of what is a-coming on?"
“ You mean presentiments?”
“ Well; so long as you knows what I means, never mind
what you calls it. Well, sir,” continued he, nodding his
head at the clock above the fireplace, “ that's a presentment
to me."
6 That clock?"
Yes, sir; that clock."
He stopped for the moment, as if either afraid or ashamed
to go on; and, in an abrupt and hurried tone he continued,
Well, sir; to come back to the point, Do you or do you
not believe in presentments?"
“Well," I replied, “ I am inclined to think I do."
“Well, you're inclined to think you do. Well, sir, I
wasn't suppositious at one time; I laughed at people who
talked of presentments, but I don't now; although, mind you
(here Mr. Proggles raised his forefinger impressively), all
what I've seen may turn out nothing. I've had no proof as
yet-as yet, mind you. Do you know anything of Markets-
bury?" he inquired.
On my replying in the negative, he proceeded,
“Ah, then, of course you don't know nothing about what
I'm a-going to tell you; you didn't know the party-but,
either way, that makes no difference. Well, sir, some few
months ago, a young fellow came down here with his wife
and a youngster. I took bis ticket at that 'ere door. I didn't
want no one to tell me he hadn't got too much (of what we
all want more or less on) pride, nor too great a stock of (what

we all think we got too little on) money; so I wasn't sur-
prised when he asked me to find him a cheap lodging. I
took him, sir, to the house of a friend of mine who'd got a
room to let; and found out next morning he'd come down to
one of our doctors here, to be his
young man."
“A doctor's young man?” I repeated with some degree of
curiosity, for I began to feel a strange interest in the story.
“He lodged with my friend, sir; and, not that she listened,
but plaster only dividing them, she couldn't help a-hearing
what was talked about sometimes.”
I could not understand why he did so; but as Proggles
arrived at this portion of his narrative, he dropped his voice
and looked around as if fearful that we had unseen listeners.
“ The young man's wife warn't what she seemed to be.
The cotton dress she wore on some of our coldest days
warn't what she'd always worn; and my missus felt tim-
orous of addressing sich conversation to her as she did to
some that she know'd. My friend, sir, finds out it was a
runaway match; and that the dad of the doctor's young man
didn't do as was expected when the young man come and
knuckled down, and begged him for the sake of somebody
who was there, and for the sake of a little somebody who
wasn't (but who'd make one of the family they thought
shortly), to forgive him for having married somebody the dad
didn't wish him to. The young man, sir, one morning looks
a deal whiter in the face, and comes down to ask of me what
time the first train started for London; and that day, sir, I
heard he'd got a letter, and that his dad was dead. All that,
night my friend heard him a-sobbin' like a little child, for the
old man was gone without forgiving him. Well, sir, next
morning, bad as he was for he'd always been weak and
delicate ever since he come-he made ready for to go. With
his wife and young 'un he comes down to this office; and if
I was to live to be a centurion-no, not for a hundred years
-should I ever forget that parting. My friend says and I
thinks her fully justified in her expression) that she's certain
sure that that poor girl had got a-something on her mind-a
presentment, sir, that she'd never see him again. Lor bless
you, sir! she cried as if her heart would break."
The speaker had a singular catching in his voice as he related
this, and his eyes blinked as if they'd got something in them
they were not used to. There was a brief silence, during
which the clock kept on repeating my dead friend's name.
"I shall see you again soon, ,'” continued the porter, blink-
ing, and looking at the fire as if that caused him to do so; " I

shall be here again by Monday week,' the young man said, sir;
but for all this the wife didn't seem satisfied. She put her
arms close round him, as if she thought once parted, parted
for good and all. None of us knows, sir, what he was a-
thinkin' on; but on getting into the carriage he says, 'Why,
Emmy, my pet! why, what's the matter? I shan't be gone
above ten days;' and then he laughs and says, 'I shan't forget
you, darling! you'll never leave my mind. I'll be down by
the mail on Monday night. He asked me if it didn't come
in at three. “At 10 minutes past,' says I. • Cheer up,' he
says to his wife, as I slammed the carriage door. “Look out
for me at 10 minutes past three on Tuesday morning. I'll be
with you. Good-by, Proggles; I SHALL SEE YOU FIRST, BEFORE
I GET HOME. Good-by.
God bless you
!'
The interest that I felt at the commencement of the story
had gradually increased. The place where he lived; his occu-
pation; his cause of leaving; the very time he started—all
corresponded so minutely, that it left not a shadow of doubt
upon my mind that the DOCTOR'S YOUNG MAN AND MY DEAD
FRIEND WERE ONE AND THE SAME!
“ A few days after,” Proggles went on to say, "there comes
a letter from the young man a-saying that, as no will hadn't
been found, he being an only child, the property was his.
Monday week comes at last; that train that you come by was
in, sir; and, very shortly after, the whistle of the mail train
was heard. I took my place to collect the tickets; all as
come down by it passed by me; but the young man wasn't
aniong them—that I'll take my “’davy' on. Before I shut
the door and locked up for the night, I looked round just to
see that all was safe. I stood where I stand now, sir; that
same little jet of gas was a-burning about as high as it does
not too much light to see by, but enough for what I
That cheer was there, on the same spot where you are
sitting; and in that cheer, as plain as I sees you and
you sees
me, as close as I am to you now, I sees that young man then !
HE SAID HE'D SEE ME FUST; and so he kept his word.”
Steadily and resolutely my eyes encountered those of my
companion. Our hearts beat loudly, but the clock ticked
louder than them both. The almost awful stillness broken by
no sound but one-the chain of evidence that had, link by link,
proved unmistakably that he who had fulfilled his promise,
and had occupied the very seat in which I sat, was no other
than he who had died in my arms on that same night-
rendered me motionless; and, dreading the answer I should
receive, I asked,

“ What was his name?”
“Swinden, sir.”
- Too true-too true!”
“Stop, sir, till I've told

all. I

when I saw all this. I knew it was the time he said he'd
Mind what I say. I tells my story to our clerk here,
he laughs at me; to the doctor-he tells me to take a cooling
draught; to the clergyman-who talks about a hoverwrought
imagination ;-but they've changed their tone now. Mrs.
Swinden, sir, was sitting up for him, and was a-standing at
the door to meet him. A figure comes along the road and
goes straight past her in at the open door. She followed it.
There w'ere she'd always used to see him-sitting by the fire-
side-she saw him then! She spoke; made up for to touch
him; but a horrid thought comes across her, and she screams.
When my friend brings her to, out of the faint in which she
found her, his cheer was empty, as it had been since he left it.
Nothing from that time to this has been heard of him; we
don't know whether he's alive or dead. Since Monday night
I've scarcely closed my eyes a-thinking of what I saw. It
may be fancy, sir; but I've a strange presentment, somehow,
that as at that time he was seen so at that time, sir, I shall
hear of him again."
So very still—so like the silence that overhangs the
dwellings of the dead—was the quiet that had crept about us,
that I almost feared to break it by a word or motion. In a
short time, however, my companion had learned from me the
time, the manner, and the cause of my poor old school-friend's
death.
I had scarcely uttered the last words, and was confronting

What's the need ?
It hath already publicly been read
And on all sides the authority allow'd;
You may
then
spare
that time.
Wol.
Be't so :-Proceed.
Scribe. Say, Henry king of England, come into the court,
Crier. Henry king of England, come into the court.
King. Here.
Scribe. Say, Katharine queen of England, come into the
court.
Crier. Katharine queen of England, come into the court.
[the QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair,
goes about Court, comes to the King, and kneels
at his feet; then speaks.]
Q. Kath. Sir, I desire you, do me right and justice;
And to bestow your pity on me: for
I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
Born out of your dominions; having here
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
In what have I offended you? what cause
Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,
That thus you should proceed to put me off,
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness
I have been to you a true and humble wife,
At all times to your will conformable:
Even in fear to kindle your dislike,
Yea, subject to your countenance; glad, or sorry,
As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire,
Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love, although I knew
He were mine enemy.
What friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger, did I
Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice
He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind
That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
Upward of twenty years.
If, in the course
And
process
of this time, you can report,
And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty
Against your sacred person, in God's name,
Turn me away; and let the foul’st contempt
Shut door upon me, and so give me up

TRIAL OF QUEEN KATHARINE.

To the sharpest kind of justice. Please you, sir,
The king, your father, was reputed for
A prince most prudent; of an excellent
And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,
My father, King of Spain, was reckon'd one
The wisest prince, that there had reign'd by many
A year before—It is not to be question'd
That they had gather'd a wise council to them
Of every realm, that did debate this business,
Who deem'd our marriage lawful_Wherefore I humbly
Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
I will implore; if not, i' the name of Heav'n
Your pleasure be fulfilled !
[resumes her seat.]
Woł. [rises.]
You have here, lady,
(And of your choice,) these reverend fathers; men
Of singular integrity and learning,
Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled
To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless,
That longer you defer the court; as well
For your own quiet, as to rectify
What is unsettled in the king.
Camp.
Hath spoken well, and justly: Therefore, madam,
It's fit this royal session do proceed;
And that, without delay, their arguments
Be now produced, and heard.

Lord cardinad,
To you I speak.

Wol.
Your pleasure, madam?
Q. Kath.
Sir,
I am about to weep; but, thinking that
We are a queen, (or long have dream'd so,) certain
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
I'll turn to sparks of fire.
Wol.
Be patient yet.
Q. Kath. I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
Or heav'n will punish me. I do believe,
Induced by potent circumstances, that
You are mine enemy; and make my challenge:
You shall not be my judge; for it is you
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me,
Which heav'n's dew quench! Therefore, I say again,
I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
Refuse you for my judge: whom, yet once more,

I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
At all a friend to truth.
Wol.
I do profess,
You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
Have stood to charity, and displayed the effects
Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
For you, or any; how far I have proceeded,
Or how far further shall, is warranted
By a commission from the consistory,
Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
That I have blown this coal; I do deny it:
The king is present: if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
And worthily, my falsehood? yea, as much
As
you have done my truth. If he know
That I am free of your report, he knows
I am not of your wrong. Therefore, in him
It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to
Remove these thoughts from you : The which before
His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking,
And to say so no more.
Q. Kath.
My lord, my lord,
I am a simple woman, much too weak
To oppose your cunning. You are meek and humble-mouth'd;
You sign your place and calling, in full seeming
With meekness and humility; but your heart
Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
You have, by fortune, and his highness' favours
Gone slightly o'er low steps: and now are mounted,
Where powers are your retainers: and your words,
Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
You tender more your person's honour than
Your high profession spiritual. That again
I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,
And to be judged by him.
[She curtseys to the King and offers to depart.]
Camp.
The queen is obstinate,
Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
Disdainful to be tried by it; 'tis not well.

FALSTAFF'S ADVENTURES.
FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, Poins, and PRINCE OF WALES.
Poins. WELCOME, Jack; where hast thou been?
Fal. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
marry, and amen. Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead
this life long, I'll sew nether-stocks, and mend them, and
foot them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of
sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
Prince. Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
pitiful-hearted Titan !—that melted at the sweet tale of the
sun? If thou didst, then behold that compound.
Fal. You rogue, here's lime in this sack, too; there is no-
thing but roguery to be found in villainous man; yet a
coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it;a
villainous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou
wilt; if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face
of the earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not
three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is
fat, and grows old, heaven help the while! A bad world, I
say! A plague of all cowards, I say still.
Prince. How now, woolsack! what mutter you?
Fal. A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy king-
dom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore
thee like a flock of wild geese, I'll never wear hair on my
face more.
You Prince of Wales !
Prince. Why, how now, Jack,-what's the matter?
Fal. Are you not a coward? answer me to that: and Poins
there?
Prince. Ye fat paunch, an' ye call me coward, I'll stab
thee.
Fal. I call thee coward! I'll see thee hanged ere I call
thee coward; but I would give a thousand pounds I could

shoulders, you care not who sees your back; call you that
backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing !
Give me them that will face me; give me a cup of sack; I
am a rogue if I drunk to-day.
Prince. Oh villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
drinkest last.
Fal. All's one for that. A plague of all cowards still,
say I!

Prince. What's the matter ?
Fal. What's the matter? Here be four of us here have
ta'en a thousand pounds this morning.
Prince. Where is it, Jack; where is it?
Fal. Where is it? taken from us, it is; a hundred upon
poor four of us.
Prince. What, a hundred, man?
Fal. I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen
of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by miracle. I
am eight times thrust through the doublet; four through the
hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hacked
like a hand-saw,-
,_ecce signum. I never dealt better since I
was a man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards!-Let
them speak; if they speak more or less than truth, they are
villains, and the sons of darkness.
Prince. Speak, sirs :-how was it?
Gad. We four set upon some dozen-
Fal. Sixteen, at least, my lord.
Gad. And bound them. As we were sharing, some six or
seven fresh men set upon us-
Fal. And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
Prince. What, fought ye with them all?
Fal. All? I know not what ye call all; but if I fought
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish; if there were
not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no
two-legged creature.
Poins. 'Pray heaven, you have not killed some of them.
Fal. Nay, that's past praying for; I have peppered two of
them: two, I am sure, I have paid; two rogues in buckram
suits. I tell thee what, Hal-if I tell thee a lie, spit in my
fące, call me horse-Thou knowest my old ward-here I lay,
and thus I bore my point: four rogues in buckram let drive
at me
Prince. What, four? thou saidst but two, even now.
Fal. Four, Hal-I told thee four.
Poins. Ay, ay,-he said four.

Fal. These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me;
I made no more ado, but took all their seven points in my
target, thus.
Prince. Seven ? why there were but four, even now!
Fal. In buckram?
Poins. Ay, four in buckram suits.
Fal. Seven, by these hilts, or I'm a villain else.
Prince. Prythee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
Fal. Dost thou hear me, Hal?
Prince. Aye, and mark thee too, Jack.
Fal. Do so; for it is worth the listening to. These nine in
buckram, that I told thee of
Prince. So, two more already.
Fal. Their points being broken-
Poins. Down fell their hose.
Fal. Began to give me ground; but I followed me close,
came in foot and hand; and, with a thought, seven of the
eleven I paid.
Prince. Oh, monstrous ! eleven buckram men grown out
of two !
Fal. But as ill luck would have it, three misbegotten
knaves in Kendal green, came at my back, and let drive
at me;-for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see
thy hand.
Prince. These lies are like the father that begets them;
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained
knot-pated fool, obscene, greasy, tallow-keech-
Fał. What, art thou mad? art thou mad ? is not the truth
the truth?
Prince. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand ?
Come, tell us your reason; what sayest thou to this?
Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
Fal. What, upon compulsion ? No: were 1 at the strap-
pado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on
compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons
were as plenty as blackberries, I would give no man a reason
upon compulsion, I.
Prince. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; thou sanguine
coward, thou bed-presser, thou horseback-breaker, thou huge
hill of flesh-
Fal. Away, you starveling, you eel-skin, you dried neat's
tongue, you stock-fish-Oh, for breath to utter what is
like thee !--you tailor's yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you
vile standing tuck.

Prince. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and,
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me
speak but this.
Poins. Mark, Jack.
Prince. We two saw you four set on four: you bound them,
and were masters of their wealth. Mark' now, how plain a
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you four;
and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize, and have it;
yea, and can shew it you here in the house:-and, Falstaff,
you carried your fat away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity,
and roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as ever I
heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as
thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick,
what device, what starting-hole, canst thou now find out, to
hide thee from this
open
and
apparent shame?
Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack, What trick hast thou now?
Fal. By the lord, I knew ye! as well as he that made ye!
Why-hear ye, my masters—was it for me to kill the heir
apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou
knowest, I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct:
the lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct is a great
matter; I was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better
of myself and thee during my life; I, for a valiant lion, and
thou for a true prince. But, by the sun, lads, I am glad you
have the money. Hostess, clap to the doors; watch to-night,
pray to-morrow. Gallant lads! boys, hearts of gold! all the
titles of true fellowship come to you. What, shall we be
merry? shall we have a play extempore?
Prince. Content: and the argument shall be thy running
away.
Fal. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an' thou lovest me.

GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT.
[By kind permission of ROBERT BROWNING, Esq.]
I SPRANG to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;
“GOOD SPEED!” cried the watch, as the gate bolts undrew;
“SPEED!” echoed the wall to us galloping through;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.

GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT.
133
Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,
Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
Lockeren, the cocks crew, and twilight dawned clear;
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;
At Düffeld, 'twas morning as plain as could be;
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half chime,
So Joris broke silence with “ YET THERE IS TIME!"
a
At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one,
To stare through the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
With resolute shoulders, each butting away
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.
And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;
And one eye's black intelligence—ever that glance
O’er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!
And the thick heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, “ STAY SPUR!"
“Your Ross galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,
We'll remember at Aix”—for one heard the quick wheeze
Of her chest, saw her stretched ned's and staggering knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
So we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;
Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
And “ GALLOP,” gasped Joris, " FOR AIX IS IN SIGHT!”
"
“ How they 'll greet us!” and all in a moment his roan
Rolled neck and crop over, lay dead as a stone;

And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-socket's rim.
Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called
my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
And all I remember is, friends flocking round
As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground,
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due, who brought good news from
Ghent.
QUEEN MAB.
MERCUTIO.
Mer. O, THEN, I see queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her waggon-spokes made of long-spinners' legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers ;
The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small gray-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid:
a
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
(Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.)
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love!
On courtier's knees, that dream on courtsies straight;
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;

a
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream.
Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit:
And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
Tickling a parson as he lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches! ambuscadoes! Spanish blades!
Of healths five fathom deep, and then anón
Drums in his ear; at which he starts, and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab. --Shakespeare.

VALUE OF ATTENTION.
“ COURAGE_PERSEVERE.” This is the motto of a friend and
worker. Not because the eyes of Europe are upon you, for
I don't in the least believe it; nor because the eyes of even
England are upon you, for I don't in the least believe it;
not because your doings will be proclaimed with blast of
trympet at street corners, for no such musical performances
will take place; not because self-improvement is at all certain
to lead to worldly success, but simply because it is good and
right of itself, and because, being so, it does assuredly bring
with it its own resources and its own rewards. I would
further commend to you a very wise and witty piece of
advice on the conduct of the understanding which was given
more than half a century ago by the Rev. Sydney Smith-
wisest and wittiest of the friends I have lost. He says—and
he is speaking, you will please understand, as I speak, to a
school of volunteer students-he says: “ There is a piece of
foppery which is to be cautiously guarded against, the foppery
of universality, of knowing all sciences and excelling in all
arts - chemistry, mathematics, algebra, dancing, history,
reasoning, riding, fencing, Low Dutch, High Dutch, and
natural philosophy. In short, the modern precept of educa-
tion very often is, Take the Admirable Crichton for your
model, I would have you ignorant of nothing.' Now," says
he, “my advice, on the contrary, is to have the courage to be
ignorant of a great number of things, in order that you may
avoid tho calamity of being ignorant of everything.".

The one serviceable, safe, certain, remunerative, attainable
quality in every study and in every pursuit is the quality of
ATTENTION. My own invention or imagination, such as it is,
I can most truthfully assure you, would never have served
me as it has, but for the habit of commonplace, humble,
patient, daily, toiling, drudging attention. Genius, vivacity,
quickness of penetration, brilliancy in association of ideas-
such mental qualities, like the qualities of the apparition
of the externally armed head in Macbeth, will not be com-
manded; but attention, after due term of submissive service,
always will. Like certain plants which the poorest peasant
may grow in the poorest soil, it can be cultivated by any one,
and it is certain in its own good season to bring forth flowers
and fruit.—Dickens.
DEATH OF MINNEHAHA.
O The long and dreary Winter!
O the cold and cruel Winter!
Ever thicker, thicker, thicker
Froze the ice on lake and river.
Vainly could the hunter force a passage;
Vainly walked he through the forest
Sought for bird or beast and found none,
In the ghastly, gleaming forest,
Fell, and could not rise from weakness;
Perished there from cold and hunger.
Into Hiawatha's wigwam,
Came two guests, and silent,
Sat there without word of welcome
In the seat of Laughing Water;
FAMINE one, the other FEVER.
And the lovely Minnehaha
Shuddered as they looked upon her,
Shuddered at the words they uttered,
Lay down on her bed in silence,
Lay there trembling, freezing, burning,
At the looks they cast upon her,
At the fearful words they uttered.
In the wigwam with Nokomis,
With those gloomy guests, that watched her,
With the Famine and the Fever,

She was lying, the Beloved,
She the dying Minnehaha.
“ Hark!” she said, “I hear a rushing,
Hear a roaring and a rushing,
Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to me from a distance!”
“ No, my child !” said old Nokomis,
“'Tis the night-wind in the pine trees!"
“ Look!” she said; “I see my father,
Standing lonely at his doorway,
Beckoning to me from his wigwam,
In the land of the Dacotahs!”
“No, my child!” said old Nokomis,
“ 'Tis the smoke, that waves and beckons !”
“Ah!” she said, “ the eyes of Pauguk
Glare upon me in the darkness !
I can feel his icy fingers
Clasping mine amid the darkness!
HIAWATHA! HIAWATHA !”
And the desolate Hiawatha,
Far
away
amid the forest,
Miles away among the mountains,
Heard that sudden cry of anguish,
Heard the voice of Minnehaha
Calling to him in the darkness,
“HIAWATHA! HIAWATHA!”
Over snow-fields waste and pathless,
Under snow-encumbered branches,
Homeward hurried Hiawatha,
Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,
Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing
6 Wahonomin! Wahonomin!"
Would that I had perished for you,
Would that I were dead as you are!
66 Wabonomin! Wahonomin!”
And he rushed into the wigwam.
Saw the old Nokomis slowly
Rocking to and fro and moaning;
Saw his lovely Minnehaha
Lying dead and cold before him;
And his bursting heart within him
Uttered such a cry of anguish,
That the forest moaned and shuddered,
That the very stars in heaven
Shook and trembled with his anguish.

Then they buried Minnehaha.
In the snow a grave they made her,
In the forest deep and darksome,
Underneath the moaning hemlocks;
Clothed her in her richest garments,
Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,
Covered her with snow like ermine;
Thus they buried Minnehaha.
And at night a fire was lighted;
On her grave four times 'twas kindled,
For her soul upon its journey
To the Islands of the Blessed.
From his doorway Hiawatha
Saw it burning in the forest,
Stood and watched it at the doorway,
That it might not be extinguished,
Might not leave her in the darkness.
" Farewell!” said he, “ Minnehaha!
Farewell, O my Laughing water!
All
niy
heart is buried with you,
All my thoughts go onward with you!
Come not back again to labour,
Come not back again to suffer,
Where the Famine and the Fever
Wear the heart and waste the body,
Soon my task will be completed,
Soon your footsteps I shall follow
To the Islands of the Blessed,
To the Kingdom of Ponemah!
To the Land of the Hereafter!"-Longfellow.

Quince. Marry, our play is—The most lamentable comedy,
and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
Bottom. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by
the scroll:-Masters, spread yourselves.
[They stand in a line.]
Quince. Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
Bottom. Ready! Name what part I am for, and proceed.
Quince. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
Bottom. What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
Quince. A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
Bottom. That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it; if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes ; I will move
storms, I will condole in some measure. To the rest:-yet
my chief humour is for a tyrant; I could play Ercles rarely;
or a part to tear a cat in; to make all split. [Recites with a

Flute. What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
Quince. It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
Flute. Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard
coming.
Quince. That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.
Bottom. An' I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too.
I'll speak in a monstrous little voice;—“Thisby, Thisby-
Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady
dear!”
Quince. No, no; you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you
Thisby.
Bottom. Well, proceed.

Quince. Robert Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.
Snout. Here ! Peter Quince.
Quince. You, Pyramus's father; myself, Thisby's father,
and prologue; Snug, the joiner, you, the lion's part :-and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.
Snug. Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
Quince. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
roaring.
Bottom. Let me play the lion too, I will roar that I will
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will
make the duke say, “let him roar again, let him roar again."
Quince. An' you should do it too terribly, you would fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek: and that
were enough to hang us all.
All. That would hang us every mother's son.
Bottom. I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion
but to hang us: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will
roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you as
'twere any nightingale.
Quince. You can play no part but Pyramus: for Pyramus
is a sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one 'shall see in a
summer's day; a most lovely, gentleman-like man; therefore
you must needs play Pyramus.
Bottom. Well, I will undertake it. Peter Quince-
Quince. What say'st thou, bully Bottom!
Bottom. There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a
sword' to kill himself whith the lies congt abide. How
answer you that?
Starveling. I believe
We must teave the
Killing out, then
all is done.
or
Bottom. Not farwhit? I have a device will make all well.
Write me a prologue: and let the prologue seem to say, we
will do no harm with our swords; and that Pyramus is not
killed indeed; and, for the more better assurance, tell them
that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom, the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.
Snout. Will not the ladies bet mard of the lion.
Starveling. I fear it, I promise
you.

your lion living: and we ought to look to it.
Snout. Therefore, another prologue must tell he is not a
lion.
Bottom. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
be seen through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak
through, saying thus, or to the same defect,“ Ladies, or fair
ladies, I would wish you, or I would request you, or I would
entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours.

think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life:
no, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are;” and
there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly he
is Snug the joiner.
Quince. Well, it shall be so. But there are two hard things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know,
Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight. Else one must
come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and say he
comes to disfigure, or to present the person of moonshine.
Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in the
great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did
talk through the chinks of a wall.

Bottom. Some man or other must present a wall; and let
him haye some plaster, or some loam, or some rough cast about
him, to signify wall; or let him hold his finger thus, and
through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.-

My neck in a tender embrace !

Ere the world and its wickedness made me
A partner of sorrow and sin,
When the glory of God was above me,
And the glory of gladness within
Oh, my heart grows weak as a woman's,
And the fountains of feeling will flow,
When I think of the paths, steep and stony,
Where the feet of the dear ones must go ;
Of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them,
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild;
Oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy,
As the innocent heart of a child !
a
They are idols of hearts and of households,
They are angels of God in disguise;
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,
His glory still gleams in their eyes;
Oh! those truants from home and from heaven,
They have made me more manly and mild!
And I know how Jesus could liken
The Kingdom of God to a child.
Seek not a life for the dear ones,
All radiant as others have done,
But that life may have just enough shadow
To temper the glare of the sun;
I would pray God to guard them from evil,
But my prayer would bound back to myself.
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,
But a sinner must pray for himself.
The twig is so easily bended,
I have banished the rule and the rod;
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,
They have taught me the goodness of God;
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;
My frown is sufficient correction;
My love is the law of the school.
I shall leave the old house in the autumn,
To traverse its threshold no more;
Ah! how I shall sigh for the dear ones,
That meet me each morn at the door!
I shall miss the “good-nights” and the kisses,
And the gush of their innocent glee,

PUNISHMENT OF A SPY.
I SHALL never forget the delightful sensation with which I
exchanged the dark, smoky, smothering atmosphere of the
Highland hut, in which we had passed the night so uncomfort-
ably, for the refreshing fragrance of the morning air, and the
glorious beams of the rising sun, which, from a tabernacle of
purple and golden clouds, were darted full on such a scene of
natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my
eyes. To the left lay the valley, down which the Forth wan-
dered on its easterly course, surrounding the beautiful detached
hill with all its garland of woods. On the right, amid a pro-
fusion of thickets, knolls, and crags, lay the bed of a broad
mountain lake, lightly curled into tiny waves by the breath
of the morning breeze, each glittering in its course under the
influence of the sunbeams. High hills, rocks, and banks,
waving with natural forests of birch and oak, formed the
borders of this enchanting sheet of water; and, as their leaves
rustled to the wind and twinkled in the sun, gave to the
depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity. Man alone
seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in a scene where
all the ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted.
It was under the burning influence of revenge that the
wife of Macgregor commanded that the hostage exchanged
for her husband's safety should be brought into her presence.
I believe her sons had kept this unfortunate wretch out of
her sight for fear of the consequences; but, if it was so, their
humane precaution only postponed his fate. They dragged
forward at her summons a wretch already half dead with
terror, in whose agonized features I recognized, to my horror
and astonishment, my old acquaintance Morris.

He fell prostrate before the female chief with an effort to
clasp her knees, from which she drew back, as if his touch
had been pollution: so that all he could do, in token of the
extremity of his humiliation, was to kiss the hem of her
plaid. I never heard entreaties for life poured forth with
such agony of spirit. The ecstacy of fear was such, that,
instead of paralysing his tongue (as on ordinary occasions), it
even rendered him eloquent, and, with cheeks as pale as
ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes that seemed to be
taking their last look of all mortal objects, he protested, with
the deepest oaths, his total ignorance of any design on the
life of Rob Roy, whom he swore he loved and honoured as
his own soul. In the inconsistency of his terror, he said he
was but the agent of others, and he muttered the name of
Rashleigh. He prayed but for life—for life he would give all
he had in the world; it was but life he asked — life if it were
to be prolonged under tortures and privations; he asked only
breath, though it should be drawn in the damps of the lowest
caverns of their hills.
It is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing, and
contempt with which the wife of Macgregor regarded this
wretched petitioner for the poor boon of existence.
“I could have bid you live," she said, “had life been to
you the same weary and wasting burden that it is to me-
that it is to every noble and generous mind. But you !
Wretch! you could creep through the world unaffected by its
various disgraces, its ineffable miseries, its constantly accumu-
lating masses of crime and sorrow—you could live and enjoy
yourself, while the noble-minded are betrayed—while name-
less and bircbless villains tread on the neck of the brave and
long-descended : You could enjoy yourself, like a butcher's
dog
in the shambles, battening on garbage, while the slaughter
of the brave went on around you! This enjoyment you shall
not live to partake of; you shall die, base dog, and that before
yon cloud has passed over the sun.”
She gave a brief command in Gaelic to her attendants, two
of whom seized upon the prostrate suppliant, and hurried him
to the brink of a cliff which overhung the flood. He set up
the most piercing and dreadful cries that fear ever uttered.
I may well term them dreadful, for they haunted my sleep
for
years afterwards. As the murderers, or executioners (call
them as you will), dragged him along, he recognized me even
in that moment of horror, and exclaimed, in the last articulate
words I ever heard him utter, “Oh, Mr. Osbaldistone, save
me! save me!”

MARSTON MOOR.

I was
so much moved by this horrid spectacle, that,
although in momentary expectation of sharing his fate, I did
attempt to speak in his behalf; but, as might have been
expected, my interference was sternly disregarded. The
victim was held fast by some, while others, binding a large
heavy stone in a plaid, tied it round his neck, and others
again eagerly stripped him of some part of his dress. Half
naked, and thus mannacled, they hurried him into the lake
(there about twelve feet deep), drowning his last death-shriek
with a wild halloo of vindictive triumph; over which, how-
ever, the yell of mortal agony was distinctly heard. The
heavy burden splashed in the dark blue waters of the lake,
and the Highlanders, with their pole-axes and swords,
watched an instant, to guard lest, extricating himself from
the load to which he was attached, he might have struggled
to regain the shore. But the knot had been securely bound;
the victim sunk without effort; the waters, which his fall had
disturbed, settled calmly over him, and the unit of that life,
for which he had pleaded so strongly, was for ever withdrawn
from the sum of human existence. -Sir Walter Scott.

To horse! to horse ! Sir Nicholas! White Guy is at the door,
And the raven wbets his beak o'er the field of Marston Moor.

And she brought a silken banner down the narrow turret-

And mournful was the smile which o'er those lovely features
ran,

SHERIDAN'S RIDE.
Up from the south at break of day, bringing to Winchester
| fresh dismay, the affrighted air with a shudder bore, like a
herald in haste, to the chieftain's door, the terrible grumble
and rumble and roar, telling the battle was on once more-
and Sheridan twenty miles away! And wilder still those
hillows of war thundered along the horizon's bar; and louder
yet into Winchester rolled the roar of that red sea uncon-
trolled, making the blood of the listener cold-as he thought
of the stake in that fiery fray, with Sheridan twenty miles
away! But there is a road from Winchester town, a good,
broad highway leading down; and there, through the flash of
the morning light, a steed as black as the steeds of night, was
seen to pass as with eagle flight;--as if he knew the terrible
need, he stretched away with the utmost speed; hills rose and
fell—but his heart was gay, with Sheridan fifteen miles away!
Still sprung from these swift hoofs, thundering South, the
dust, like the smoke from the cannon's mouth, or the trail of
a comet sweeping faster and faster; foreboding to traitors the
doom of disaster: the heart of the steed and the heart of the
master were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls, im-
patient to be where the battle-field calls; every nerve of the
charger was strained to full play, with Sheridan only ten miles
away! Under his spurring feet, the road like an arrowy

Alpine river flowed; and the landscape sped away behind like
an ocean flying before the wind; and the steed, like a bark
fed with furnace ire, swept on with his wild eyes full of fire :
but, lo! he is nearing his heart's desire—he is snuffing the
smoke of the roaring fray, with Sheridan only five miles away!
The first that the General saw, were the groups of stragglers,
and then, the retreating troops !—What was done—what to
do-a glance told him both ; and striking his spurs, with a
terrible oath, be dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzas,
and the wave of retreat checked its course there, because the
sight of the master compelled it to pause. With foam and with
dust the black charger was gray; by the flash of his eye, and
his red nostril's play, he seemed to the whole great army to
say, “I have brought you Sheridan, all the way from Win-
chester down to save the day! Hurrah! hurrah for Sheridan !
hurrah! hurrah for horse and man! and when their statues
are placed on high under the dome of the Union sky,--the
American soldier's Temple of fame,-there, with the glorious
general's name, be it said in letters both gold and bright:

MR. TWIDDLE'S TROUBLE.*
.
As to who and what I am, and the infirmity under which I
suffer, the following brief sketch will explain.
My name is Teviotdale Twiddle; my age-two-and-twenty;
income-four hundred a-year; condition-Bachelor; pro-
fession - Gentleman. The affliction which threatens to
consume my transitory existence is one far more easily
imagined than endured or even described. I suffer from
a species of nervousness that exhibits itself in a propensity
to meddle with every object that comes within reach.
Nothing can escape my proclivity to tampering; and, most
unfortunately for myself, everybody and every article con-
cerned, all these individual volitions are exhibited on my
part without my having at the time the slightest idea of
what I am doing. So that I am, during my paroxysm, as it
were quite powerless, a victim to a spell, which neither
Age, Physic, or Advice have yet been found potent enough to,

exorcise. Say that I talk to a friend in the street, I discover
myself fingering his chain, or fumbling over his shirt collar.
Only last week I was ignominiously dismissed the house of a
most valued clerical acquaintance through unconsciously
pulling off the apron of the maid servant and tying it round
myself
, whilst making preliminary enquiries on the doorstep
of the rectory. An event which occurred last Thursday week,
crowned all my preceding misfortunes. You must know that
on the previous evening I was present at one of the most
fashionable concerts of the season. Enraptured with one of
the divine airs from “Martha,” I all at once discovered myself
breathing on, polishing, looking through and unscrewing a pair
of opera glasses which somebody had placed
my
immediate
proximity. I was of course confused; and, looking round, I
encountered the eyes of a young lady fixed on me as firmly as
a bee on a sunflower. I was enraptured; for the moment
entranced-spell-bound by her beauty. She was evidently
the owner of the glasses; she tried to take them from me, but
as she, naturally enough, extended her hand, I, with my
habitual infirmity, no less naturally took her hand in mine;-on
my honour, I assure you the act was purely involuntary on
my part. Her friends immediately remonstrated; I attempted
to apologise, but in vain; redress or explanation was peremp-
torily refused; several misguided individuals in the gallery
shouted ORDER,” some one in the front seats cried SEND
FOR THE POLICE;" and, overwhelmed with confusion, I found
myself being ignominiously carried out of the hall. Bent on an
explanation, I hurried to the music-sellers where the tickets
were procured and places booked. I gave them a description
of the whole party, and ascertained that they came from the
house of a Mrs. Scripp, who resided in the neighbourhood.
Scripp! the name was familiar; I remembered that a fourth .
cousin of that name on my mother's side who, (so I was once
told), resided somewhere in India. On that Thursday after-
noon I accordingly called at the house, asked for the mistress,
sent in my card, and was ushered into the drawing-room. My
first impression from the manner in which the servant answered
my preliminary enquiry, was that I had been expected; this
idea however was immediately dispelled, by the way in which
the girl read my name on the card. I repeat, I was shewn
into the drawing-room, and left alone. Whilst I ruminated
on the most effectual method of introducing the painful nature
of the business that brought me there, as my thoughts became
more and more concentrated on what would probably be my
reception, my unhappy failing obtruded itself with a force

that my sturdiest resolution could not withstand. Every
article in the room came in its turn to be the object of my
tampering proclivity. I will not allude to the fancy Oriental
dusting brush, the feathers of which I plucked out so vehe-
mently, and in proportion to the rapidity of my thoughts,
that in less than two minutes, it was as bald as the head of a
sucking pig; neither will I advert to a bottle of Eau de
Cologne, with which in my melancholy excited unconscious-
ness, I saturated my pocket handkerchief and every chair
and Anti-macassar in the immediate vicinity; I will not
dwell upon the fact that of the plants in the adjoining
conservatory, I plucked several stems perfectly bare; nor
my feelings on being subsequently informed that I had
decorated
my
button-hole with a Rhododendron. These
extraordinary evidences of my incomprehensible malady are
scarcely worthy of a thought, in comparison with the all but
unutterable dilemma with which I was almost immediately to
be overwhelmed. One object in the apartment was destined
to inflict on me, in fifteen minutes, more anxiety, misery, and
despair than in the existence of half a century I could attempt
to adequately describe. My recreant fingers happened to stray
upon-what? A NECKLACE!—A DIAMOND NECKLACE! which
was lying comfortably ensconced in an open velvet case on the
table. On it my gaze became instantly rivetted. I took it in
my hands; inspected it! " Diamonds! hers of course!” I
muttered, alluding to the beautiful proprietress of the opera
glass. "" Diamonds ! not half so brilliant as her eyes ! A
necklace too! Fancy! it has clasped her neck, her swan-like
throat, so white, so majestic! Ah!” I continued as I contem-
plated it, “what's my throat in comparison with hers; it would
go about half-way round that I suppose.” Instantly I was as-
sailed by my insane desire, my unconquerable weakness ! why
shouldn't I try it on and see what a brute I looked, how much of
the mere animal was man, compared with that most graceful
female of all the feminine gender? I took the necklace up, put
it at the back of my neck; was taking the exact measurement
of that part of my anatomy in proportion to hers, when—the
parlour door was suddenly opened, and—“My mistress will
see you directly,” said the servant girl entering. I started-
"Oh goodness gracious! Horror of horrors !"
THE NECKLACE SLIPPED DOWN MY BACK !!!
I desperately thrust one hand down my back, and the other
up inside my coat-tails to stop its further progress; and, in
this agonizing posture, found myself face to face with the
astonished handmaid.

« What's the matter, sir?" gasped the girl.
“Matter! nothing," I answered.
I'm feeling for my
gloves."
“ Lor' bless us, sir!” rejoined the girl, “Do you keep your
gloves there?"
I don't know what I answered, but I continued to dive fur-
ther and further into the recesses of my back: I was just clutch-
ing the perambulating object of my search, when I raised my
eyes and encountered a demure looking genteel lady of some
fifty-five summers,—she was gazing through a pair of gold
spectacles on me in my interesting posture, evidently with a
species of bewildered fascination.
“Good morning, ma'am," I stammered, as I struggled into
an erect posture; “Mrs. Scripp?"
She said nothing, but with an astonished matronly dignity
motioned me to take a seat. Then there ensued an ominous
pause. The necklace, by jerky stages, was steadfastly resolved
on making its pilgrimage down my back; it was every moment
sinking more hopelessly; as a last resource, to impede its pro
gress, I spasmodically buttoned my coat, and clapped my
hand to the centre of my back.
“You seem uneasy,” frigidly observed the old lady.
“Yes, madam," I replied, confusedly, as I felt the necklace
taking another leap; that is, if I must tell you, I
suffering from--from-CORNS," I added, to clinch the ex-
planation.
The old lady positively glared at me through her gold spec-
tacles. I felt her do it--for I was burning all over to that ex-
tent with the sudden consciousness of the profound mystery
and indignation into which my reply had plunged her, that not
for worlds could I have summoned courage to look her in the
face.
“With CORNS, sir?” she ejaculated. “What! IN THE
MIDDLE OF YOUR BACK ?”
I think I heard myself trying to make some sound expres-
sive of a laugh; but if I did, it was one of the most ghastly
attempts that mortal ears were ever called on to endure.
May I inquire the object of your visit? Mr. said
Mrs. Scripp
widdle, ma'am, Teviotdale Twiddle." I felt those gold
spectacles were piercing me again, and every moment was
consigning the necklace further and further into unexplored
regions: if I could but get her out of the room, but for an
instant, whilst I divested myself of my coat and vest, I should
be satisfied; but such an idea was hopeless, there she sat,

with an immovable dignity, and those gold spectacles, under
which all my words, thoughts, acts, my very limbs them-
selves,-all but my back, seemed PARALYZED. I expected every
moment the gold spectacles would be removed from me, only
to discover the empty case, and that the necklace was missing.
“Mr. Twiddle, Teviotdale Twiddle," I found myself
murmuring. I am most respectably connected. I've four
hundred a year and-
“I'm not aware that it's necessary to present your cre-
dentials, Mr.-_"
“ Twiddle, ma'am, Teviotdale Twiddle."
As I said this, I put my hand out, as if accidentally, on to
the tenantless case and closed it, but, oh! unfortunately she
saw the action. True, she had not discovered the necklace
had been abstracted; but the very fact of my tampering with
the case, when the loss should eventually be known, together
with the circumstantial evidence of the necklace being found
in my possession, would be sufficient to convict me.
In
imagination I was already sentenced to fourteen years' trans-
portation at the very least. The crisis was approaching: how
on earth could I now enter into an explanation about the
opera-glass of the preceding evening; that very fact, when
coupled with my present wretched and inextricable situation,
would serve but to confirm suspicion, and brand me at once
as one of the most fashionable and consummate burglars that
the age had yet produced. Already I pictured myself making
one in those forcible representations of convicts which are so
unpleasantly attractive in the Penny Illustrated Police News,
and fancy sketched me shorn of my auburn whiskers and
golden locks, in canvas trousers, with a crimson shirt, and
à battered nose, leading a band of bushrangers to a nocturnal
murderous pillage. Oh! if a trap door could but have been
found to swallow me up in that drawing room! or if some
professional prestidigateur could only have been induced to
wave by his wand that fugitive necklace to its home again.
My fate was all but sealed: I was conceiving how I should
make the confession—the icy stare with which the extricated
article would be received; how every striving on my part to
lud date the mystery would gradually contract in my utter-
ance, and finally shrink before the interpretation those gold
spectacles would put upon it, when there flashed upon me a
happy thought I remembered suddenly that I had distant
relatives of the name of Scripp living somewhere in India.
In an instant I had hazarded the experiment-unfortunately,
as it turned out-with the most disastrous results.

“I beg your pardon,” I stammered out, “but the fact is, I
am nearly related to your family.”
" To my family?” echoed the old lady.
“Yes! by the Indian branch,—the Scripps of-of-of Bom-
bay," I said, ap-hazard.
The old lady rose, stared, retreated several paces, became
instantly flushed; then beaming with excitement and delight,
she exclaimed, “ You are he, then. I thought so from the
first ? ”
Advancing towards me, she took me by both hands, shook
them violently, and finally fell upon my neck in a shower' of
tears and hysterical sobs.
“Goodness gracious, ma'am !" I exclaimed, struggling to
release myself, for I felt sure my chair, having upon it now
the additional weight of Mrs. Scripp, would every moment
give way.
· Pray, compose yourself; what is the matter ?”
“ After so many years of absence, too !” said the lady, " to
think we should meet and be about to part like this. You,
too; HER HUSBAND :" and down on my neck the old lady sank
once more, and the chair gave again an ominous wriggle and
a creak. I felt as if I were stricken motionless to the spot.
What could I do? What had I done? She was evidently
mistaking me for some one-who, I had not the slightest idea.
Why did
you send us in a false name?” said the old lady,
disentangling me from her embrace ; "was it done to give us
the greater surprise? Oh, you wicked Don Juan, you ! but
you want to see your wife, of course; so you shall see her-
she has been expecting you all day.” She advanced towards
the bell-pull.
Bless my soul, did I dream, or was the old lady mad. My
situation was every minute growing more and more alarming.
I had never met with anything so awful.
“Ma'am," I began, imploringly. “Don't! pray don't,
Ma'am !"
“Ma'am ! call me Mamma ! for, though we have never met
before, have we not been related for years! Mary said you
would be here to-day. I didn't believe it, but”-
"Don't Ma'am-Mamma, I mean-excuse me ma'am, I'm
not here at all—that is, he isn't here at all-I ought to be
somebody else; but I'm not, I'm not he-so I'd rather not
see SHE-I am Teviot Twiddle- -excuse me.”
“ What !” exclaimed the old lady, pausing.
“I can't express to you what I feel,” I began—this was
literally the fact, for, with every movement, the diamonds
were cutting into my back like a twenty-bladed knife-_“I

cannot express the regret I feel at having been thus the inno-
cent cause of your agitation; but
I felt the gold spectacles were through me again.
You ’re mistaken ! I'm not the—the individual you take
me for."
The gold spectacles, though still on me, were gradually
sinking aghast into a chair.
“I regret exceedingly that I have intruded, I assure you;
but my name is Teviotdale Twiddle, I am four-and-twenty
years of age
The gold spectacles, I felt, were absolutely quivering with
embarrassment, and glaring with astonished indignation. Once
more the wearer moved towards the door-
“I apprehend you, sir," she said.
No, no," I replied—in my excited imagination connecting
the term with police phraseology and the necklace. “ Don't!
I'm a perfect paragon of honesty! I wouldn't wrong you or
any human being of a farthing."
The gold spectacles were now looking at me through and
through ; the gaze gradually relaxed into one of reproach,
then into something of pity; lastly, unmistakably into fear.
The old lady moved stealthily towards the door; it was all
over: she evidently thought me insane-another instant, the
door had closed on her-I was once more ALONE.
Time was precious,- ,-a few moments and the servants would
be there to remove me as a lunatic or expel me as an impostor :
only to brand me subsequently as a housebreaker. Heart,
soul, and action-all were instantly combined to recover the
unhappy cause of my seemingly endless misery. I seized the
tongs-down my back they went in the search : they grasped
-
it-but for a moment and down, and down the necklace slid
more frantically than before. I took off my coat-vest-no
use. Suddenly I shook myself violently—my body first, and
afterwards my leg; when, to my inexpressible joy, I felt the
necklace sliding gradually ; but, unfortunately, instead of
finding its way, as I fondly anticipated it would, to the
ground, it lodged in the heel of my boot. Any one would
suppose that I might now have seized on my prize and restored
it immediately; but no! that boot was destined but to add to
my still further discomfiture. The bootmaker had made it so
tight that when it was off you couldn't get it on, and when it
was on you couldn't get it off. All that I remember for the
next three minutes is, the entrance of the servant, my induc-
ing her, by half a sovereign, to procure me a bootjack; and
finally, contemplating with unutterable satisfaction the boot

off :-lying before me, as if its neck was broken; and the
diamond necklace in my hand-regained. With one sad,
never-to-be-erased-from-my-memory incident, I conclude.
I had recovered the diamonds; my boot was off; but how
on earth was I to get it on again; how, when, and where
could I find a pair of boothooks! in vain I searched: fruitlessly
I turned over the work basket, pulled open drawers, explored
every table: in desperation I seized on a paper knife and a
pen !--they snapped with the first tug. At length I grasped
Ι
the poker, and encased that through one strap. I then ex-
perimentalized, but inefficiently, through the other, with the
shovel,—the latter fire-iron was too large. Dragging myself
across the room with the poker dangling at my bootless heel,
I seized on the leg of one chair, and seating myself firmly on
another-unfortunately it was the one I had occupied when
Mrs. Scripp had been overcome—I determined to pull on
that boot or perish in the attempt. With a violent effort, my
veins starting to my forehead, my face purple with my pre-
vious exertions, with rigid muscles and extended leg, I threw
my concentrated strength into the act and flung myself back.
The chair, whose powers of endurance had been already tried to
the utmost, yielded to the shock and gave way.
-I am conscious of witnessing he ceiling, floor, and furni-
ture turn suddenly topsy-turvy, like a flash of lightning,
of there being a wild and awful crash, as of falling steel,
of the first object that met my eyes being my boots elevated
into the air, of my face being exactly opposite the gasalier in
the centre of the ceiling, and the back of my
head being
amongst the fire-irons in an upturned fender.---All this took
place just as the door opened, and Mrs. Scripp, her niece, and
somebody else came into the room. In this ambiguous
position we formed an interesting group: I remaining for
some moments motionless and speechless, gazing on their
astonished faces, without the slightest attempt at recognition
or explanation, they in their turn staring silently at me.
This was the final and most impressive of the tableaux.
All was eventually explained: I was really a relative-but a
very distant one. The niece of Mrs. Scripp, the young lady
who had been the innocent cause of all my misfortunes, had
been married in India, and had returned some months before,
leaving her husband to follow her. He had been expected on
the day and at the very hour on which I made
my memorable
visit; butreally-the facts have affected me so much in
thus attempting to relate them that-pardon me-excuse me
- I can say no more.- Walter Baynham.

Eve. My friends, pray be seated; I wish to consult
you. This day twelve months I succeeded to an immense
income, and as, by a happy coincidence, on the same day I
secured your esteem, so now I wish to ask you
if
you
think
I could have spent that income in a way more worthy your
good opinion.
Gloss. Impossible! excellent taste-beautiful house!
Blount. Vewy good horses.
Lady Frank. Splendid pictures!
Graves. And a magnificent cook!
Omnes. [except Sir John). Very true!
Eve. What say you, Sir John? You may think me a little
extravagant; but you know that in this world the only
way to shew one's self thoroughly respectable is to make a
thoroughly respectable show.
Sir John. Certainly-certainly! No, you could not have
done better.
Geor. Certainly. Don't retrench, Alfred !

Stout. Plebeian, sir! worse than plebeian !-it is against
all the rules of public morality: Every one knows, now-a-
days, that extravagance is a benefit to the population-
encourages art-employs labour--and multiplies spinning-
jennies.
Eve. You reassure me! I own I did think that a man
worthy of friends so sincere might have done something
better than feast-dress-drink-play-
Gloss. Nonsense !-we like you the better for it.
Eve. And you are as much my friends now as when you
offered me £10 for

Come, my friends---come; when the standard of money goes

SYMPATHY.
WHENEVER We are formed by nature for any active purpose,
the passion which animates us to it is attended with delight,
or a pleasure of some kind, let the subject matter be what it
will: and, as our Creator has designed we should be united
together by so strong a bond as that of sympathy, he has
therefore twisted along with it a proportionable quantity of
this ingredient; and always in the greatest proportion where
our sympathy is most wanted, --in the distresses of others.
If this passion was simply painful, we should shun, with the
greatest care, all persons and places that could excite such a
passion; as some, who are so far gonė in indolence as not to
endure any strong impressions, actually do. But the case is
widely different with the greater part of mankind : there is
no spectacle we so eagerly pursue, as that of some uncommon
and grievous calamity; so that, whether the misfortune is
before our eyes, or whether they are turned back to it in
history, it always touches with delight; but it is not an un-
mixed delight, but blended with no small uneasiness. The
delight we have in such things, hinders us from shunning

scenes of misery; and the pain we feel, prompts us to relieve
ourselves in relieving those who suffer: and all this (anteced-

purposes, without our concurrence.—Burke.
COPPERFIELD'S COURTSHIP.
[By kind permission of Messrs. CHAPMAN & HALL.]
:
I was articled to Spenlow and Jorkins. I had ninety pounds
a-year from my aunt. My rooms were engaged for twelve
months, certain. About this time I made three discoveries:
first, that my landlady, Mrs. Crupp, was a martyr to a curious
disorder called “the spazzums," which was generally accom-
panied by inflammation of the nose. Secondly, that something
peculiar in the temperature of my pantry made the brandy
bottles burst. Thirdly, that I was alone in the world, and
much given to record that fact in fragments of English versi-
fication.
On the day I was articled, Mr. Spenlow remarked that he
should have been happy to have seen me at his house in
Norwood, to celebrate our becoming connected, but for his
domestic arrangements being in some disorder, on account of
the expected return of his daughter from finishing her educa-
tion in Paris. In a week or two he referred to this, and said,
that if I would do him the favour to come down on Saturday
and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy. Of
course I said I would do him the favour, and he was to drive
me down in his phaeton, and bring me back.
There was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house, and
though it was not the best time of the year for seeing a garden,
it was so beautifully kept, I was quite enchanted.
“ Here
Miss Spenlow walks by herself," I thought. “ Dear me!”
We went into the house, which was cheerfully lighted up,
and into a hall where there were all sorts of hats, caps, great-
coats, plaids, gloves, whips, and walking sticks. " Where is
Miss Dora?" said Mr. Spenlow. “Dora!" I thought. “What
?.
a beautiful name!”
We turned into a room near at hand, and I heard a voice
say, “Mr. Copperfield, my daughter Dora.” It was no doubt
Mr. Spenlow's voice, but I didn't know it, and I didn't care
whose it was. All was over in a moment. I had fulfilled my
destiny: I was a captive and a slave. I loved Dora Spenlow to

distraction. She was more than human to me,--she was a
fairy, a sylph,—I don't know what she was: anything that no
one ever saw, and everything that everybody ever wanted. I
was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant. There
was no pausing on the brink--no looking down or looking back.
I was gone headlong before I had sense to say a word to her.
I don't remember who was there except Dora; I have not the
least idea of what we had for dinner except Dora; my im-
pression is that I dined off Dora entirely. She had the most
delightful little voice, the gayest little laugh, the pleasantest.
and most fascinating little ways that ever led a lost youth into
hopeless slavery. All I know of the rest of the evening, is,
that I heard the empress of my heart sing enchanted ballads
in the French language, generally to the effect that whatever
was the matter we ought always to dance, Ta ra la, Ta ra
la ! That I retired to bed in a maudlin state of mind, and
got up in a crisis of feeble infatuation. It was a fine morning,
and early, and I thought I would go and take a stroll in the
garden, and indulge my passion by dwelling on her image.
On my way through the hall I encountered her little dog, who
was called Jip. I approached him tenderly, for I loved even
him, but he shewed his whole set of teeth, got under a chair
expressly to snarl, and wouldn't hear of the least familiarity.
I had not been walking long when I turned a corner, and-
met-HER.
“ You-are-out early, Miss Spenlow.”
“It's so stupid at home on a Sunday morning when I don't
practice. I must do somethiug. Besides it's the brightest
time of the whole day. Don't you
think so !”
I hazarded a bold flight, and said, that it was very bright
to me then, though it had been very dark a minute before.
“Do you mean a compliment? or that the weather has
changed ?”
I stammered worse than before, in replying, that I meant
no compliment, but the plain truth; I was not aware of any
change having taken place in the weather. It was in the state
of my own feelings.
“ You have just come home from Paris ?” said I.
Yes,” said she. “Have you ever been there ?"
6 No!"
“Oh! I hope you 'll go soon! You would like it so much !”
Traces of deep-seated anguish appeared in my countenance.
That she should hope I would go, that she could think it
possible I could, was insupportable. I depreciated Paris, I
depreciated France. I said I wouldn't leave England under

existing circumstances for any earthly consideration. She was
shaking the curls again, when the little dog came running along
the ground to our relief. He was mortally jealous of me, and
persisted in barking at me. She took him up in her arms and
oh, my gracious !-caressed him. If it had lasted any longer, I
think I should have gone down on my knees on the gravel walk.
How many cups of tea I drank because she made it I don't
know. But I perfectly remember that I sat swallowing tea
until my whole nervous system (if I had any in those days)
must have gone by the board. By-and-bye we went to church.
I heard Dora sing, and the congregation vanished. A sermon
was delivered-of course, about Dora-and I am afraid that is
all I know of the service. We had a quiet day. No company, a
walk, a family dinner of four, and an evening of looking over
books and pictures. Ah! little did Mr. Spenlow imagine, when
he sat opposite to me after dinner that day with his pocket
handkerchief over his head, how fervently I was embracing him
in fancy as his son-in-law. Little did he think, when I took
leave of him at night, that in the same fancy) he had just
given his consent to my being engaged to Dora, and that I
was invoking blessings on his head! It came to pass that Mr.
Spenlow told me this day week' was Dora's birthday, and that
he would be glad if I would come down and join a little pic-
nic on the occasion. I went out of my senses immediately,
became a mere driveller next day, on receipt of a little lace-
edged sheet of note-paper,—“Favoured by papa. To remind.”
At six in the morning I was at Covent Garden Market buying
a bouquet for Dora ; at ten I was on horseback. I hired a
gallant grey for the occasion—with the bouquet in my hat to
keep it fresh_trotting down to Norwood. There was a young
lady with her, one comparatively stricken in years—almost
twenty I should say. Her name was Miss Mills. Dora called
her Julia. She was the bosom friend of Dora! Happy Miss
Mills! My jealousy of the ladies knew no bounds. But all
of my own sex, especially one imposter with a Red Whisker,
were my mortal foes.
We unpacked our baskets, and employed ourselves in
getting dinner ready. Red Whisker pretended he could
make a salad. Some of the young ladies washed the lettuces
for him, and sliced them under his directions. Dora was one
of these. I felt that fate had pitted me against this man, and
one of us must fall. Red Whisker made his salad, (I wondered
how they could eat it, nothing should have induced me to
touch it). By-and-bye I saw him, with the majority of a
lobster on his plate, eating his dinner at the feet of Dora.

merry, I know, but it was hollow merriment. I attached my-
self to a young creature in pink, with little eyes, and flirted
with her desperately. I caught Dora's eye, and I thought it
looked appealing, but it looked at me over the head of Red
Whisker, and I was adamant. Whilst the remnants of the
dinner were being put away, I strolled by myself among the
trees in a raging and remorseless state. I was debating whether
I should pretend I was not well and fy—I don't know where
-upon my gallant grey; when Dora and Miss Mills met
“Mr. Copperfield," said Miss Mills, “ you are dull."
I begged her pardon, “ Not at all.”
“ And Dora you are dull!”
Oh, dear no! Not in the least.”
" Mr. Copperfield and Dora. Do not allow a trivial mis-
understanding to wither the blossoms of spring, which once
put forth and blighted, can never be renewed. I speak from
the past—the irrevocable past. The oasis in the desert of
Sahara must not be plucked up idly.” I hardly knew what I,
did, I was burning all over to that extraordinary extent;
but I took Dora's little hand and kissed it and she let me.
I kissed Miss Mill's hand, and we all seemed to go straight
up to the seventh heaven, and we did not come down again.
We stayed there all the evening. “Dora is coming to stay with
me," said Miss Mills, “ she is coming home with me to-mor-
If you would call I am sure papa would be happy to see
you.” What could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss
Mills' head ! and store Miss Mills' address in the securest
corner of my memory!
When I awoke next morning, I was resolute to declare my
passion to Dora, and know my fate. Happiness or misery was
now the question. Arrayed at a vast expense, I went to Miss
Mills', fraught with a declaration. Mr. Mills was not at home.
I did not expect he would be : nobody wanted him. Miss
Mills was at home; Miss Mills would do. I was shewn into a
room up-stairs where Miss Mills and Dora were : Jip was
there. Miss Mills was copying music—a new song, Affection's
Dirge. Dora was painting flowers. What were my feelings
when I recognized my own flowers;—the identical Covent
Garden purchase. I can't say that they were very like, or
that they resembled any flowers that have ever come under
my observation; but I knew from the paper round them,
which was very accurately copied, what the composition was.

Miss Mills was very glad to see me, and very sorry that
papa was not at home: but I thought we all bore that with
uncommon fortitude. Miss Mills, laying down her pen, got
up and left the room. 1 began to think I would put it off till
to-morrow.
“I hope your poor horse wasn't tired when he got home at
night! It was a long way for him!”
I began to think that I would do it to-day.
“ It was a long way for him," said I, “for he had nothing
to uphold him on the journey.'
-“ Wasn't he fed, poor thing?" asked Dora.
I began to think I would put it off till to-morrow.
“Ye-yes,” said I, “ he was well taken care of—I mean,
that he hadn't the unutterable happiness of being so near you.”
“ You didn't seem sensible of that happiness yourself at one
time of the day.”
I scw I was in for it, and it must be done on the spot.

were sitting by Miss Kitt.” (Kitt was the name of the creature

why you should, or why you shouldn't, call it a happiness at
all. But of course you don't mean what you say. Jip, you .
naughty boy, come here."
I don't know how I did it. I intercepted Jip. I had Dora
in my arms. I was full of eloquence. I never stopped for a
word. I told her how I loved her. I told her I should die
without her. I told her that I idolized and worshipped her.
Jip barked madly all the time. Dora hung her head and
trembled, my eloquence increased the more. If she would
like me to die for her, she had but to say, the word, and I was
ready. Life without Dora's love was not a thing to have, on
any terms: I couldn't bear it, and I wouldn't. I had loved
her every minute, day and night, since I first saw her. I
loved her at that minute to distraction. I should always love
her every minute to distraction. Lovers had loved before,
lovers would love again; but no lover had ever loved, might,
could, would, or should ever love as I loved Dora. The more
I raved, the more Jip barked. So Dora and I were engaged.

COUNT ABEL.
[By kind permission of CHARLES DICKENS, Esq.]
THROUGH the woods of Normandy, and past the yellow
haunted meres,
Rode Count Abel, at the sunrise, in a girth of fifty spears;
Bright his eye, and broad his forehead; and in many a
wrinkled mass
Rolled his tawn hair down his shoulders, like a scarp of
shining brass.
Bridal colours, gorgeous favours, knight and swart retainers
wore,
And the keen points of their lances twisted rosé and lily bore;
Cheerly blew the morning breezes; cheerly over holt and lea,
Rang the silver-hearted steeples to the bridal company.
As they pricked with jest and laughter through the blasted
Linden dells,
On the wind there slid the clamours, low and long, of funeral
bells,
Solemn wailings, like the noises heard upon a northern shore,
When the grim sea-caves are tideless, and the storm strives
at their core.
As along the dusky pine-lands in a silent band they spurred,
The bell-throated lamentation louder to the south was heard,
Peals of heart-deliver'd anguish, seething, steaming to the
skies,
Like the writhing smoke uplifted from some mountain sacrifice.
Where a freshet, amber-sided, trickled lightnings through the
gorse,
The brave bridegroom, fair Couat Abel, turn’d aside and
reined his horse;
Placed his hand within his bosom, and from out his doublet's
fold
Slowly drew, with trembling hand, a jewelled disk of ruddy
gold.
“Come hither, Bertrand, to my side; come hither, loving
trusty knight;
Look, and tell me what thou seest hidden in the locket bright?
By the sword that smote thy shoulders, and the great badge
thou dost wear,
Take the trinket in tby palm, and say what thou beholdest
there."

“I see the love-lock of thy bride, my gentle sister Madeline;
Whiter than the sea-creek, chafing nightly in the sad moon-
shine;
Grayer than the sunless snow-drift clinging to the summer
crag-
Grayer than the death-lock gathered from the poll of a strang-
led hag."
“May HE shield us, good Sir Bertrand; it was only yesternight,
Once, and twice, and thrice I kissed it in the swinging cresset
light,
And I saw it brown and golden as the antlers of the deer,
When their great heads bourgeon, oak-like, in the spring-time
of the year.”
“SPUR ON;"—they galloped o'er the swarth; they plunged into
the roaring ford;
The riders' brows were damp with sweat; the swift strong
horses' flanks were gored;
Upon glittering plume and bonnet the hot sun of July shone,
And ever cried the frightened Count, “SPUR ON, SPUR ON, good
friends, SPUR ON.
High on the swart ridge of a hill they paused a little space
for breath,
The long, green valley of Rennay, with many a brook, sheamed
underneath;
A funeral train crept up the slopes, with holy chants, and
sacred rights,
With cowlèd priests, and wimpled nuns, and singing clerks
and acolytes.
And, in the middle of the train, prone on a bier of satin fair,
Did sleep the Lady Madeline, a white rose in her ashbud
hair;
Her sad palms clasped above her breast, in the mute trustful-
ness of faith,
And on her cheek and on her lids, the mystic presences of
DEATH.
Down rode Count Abel from the group, and rein'd his horse
beside the dead,
Look'd in her face, and to her brow he slowly bent his plumèd
head.
“ Tell me, O Heaven, he cried aloud, and sudden dropp'd
the silken rein,
“ What foul misdeed assoils my soul that thou hast cut my
heart in twain ?"

Then rising, to the blinded heavens he stretched his hands
despairing forth,
Shrieked, reeled aslant his saddle bows, and, falling headlong,
smote the earth.
Yet clutched he fondly in his hand the locket rich with jewels
fair,
And rounding in its goodly orb the white prophetic lock of
hair.
Still up the valley passed the train, with holy chants and
pious rights,
With cowlèd priets, and wimpled nuns, and singing clerks
and acolytes.
But men aver the lady's eyes did slowly open bright and

Sir W. Now, my dear, that we are alone, I must tell you
that your behaviour has been abominable.
Mar. Oh! has it? Now if I didn't think I was quite the
lady!
Sir W. What with your directions respecting your animals,
and your reference to your cousin Joe, and the old woman your
schoolmistress, and your ridiculous eulogium on the uniform
of the yeomanry, I thought I should have taken to my heels
and have run out of the house.
Mar. I wish you had I know I should have got on much
better without

my elbow. And as for my cousin Joe,
he may be a stupid fellow and all that, but he's a very good
fellow, and if he don't know how to make a proper bow, or a
long speech like you do—such as when I've heard you
practising to yourself about railroads, and borrowing money,
and taxes, and the state of the nation, and situation of the
population, and that horrible education-he can talk so as I
can understand him, and that's more than I always can when
you talk-or anybody else, for the matter o' that. And if
I did like the sojers I used to see so often, what harm was
there in that? I'm sure the captain was a fine man, a very
fine man, 1 hiskers and all, and I've often looked at him till
I've felt as I could eat him.

Sir W. I know that you mean no harm-I know that your
heart is pure; but you must learn to be conscious of your
present station in society. The diamond, though of value in
its rough and original state, must be polished and set before
it can be worn. Now, to-day, when I rang for the cook and

to ask for what I liked better than anything.
Sir W. And are you aware what you did ask for?
Mar. I only asked for a toad in a hole.
Sir W. And didn't you perceive the vain endeavour of the
servant to conceal his laughter? didn't you perceive my face
suffused with blushes ?
Mar. Well, I speak according to my knowledge, and I
know I always speak the truth and what I want to say, with-
out any beating about the bush; and that's much better than
being deceitful and making believe to be glad to see people
when you really wish 'em at Jericho, and go grinning and
smiling up to 'em, and shaking hands, when in your heart
you'd like to shake 'em inside out and make use of fine
words and say beautiful things when you don't mean it. You
may call it polish if you like, but I call it telling lies.

break his little fiddle over his head for him !

for you-says his name is Cousin Joe.

Joe. Yes.
Mar. That's right.
Joe. I'm going up to a place in London. You see, mother
knows somebody there, and as I didn't care much about
farming, and always had a kind o' sort o' notion of being a
bit of a gentleman, why, they said I was cut out for sarvice;
and the end of it is, I'm going to London to be a page to a
fine lady:
Mar. La! Joe !
Joe. The very thing for a genteel youth like me, they say.
I ain't to wear these clothes then. No, I'm to be all over
buttons, and have a hat with gold lace, and my hair is to be
curled every morning, and I'm to carry letters in to missus on
a silver plate, and walk arter her with the lap-dog in the
street, and take care nobody's sarcy to her.
Mar. Can't you stop here a day or two before you go to
your place? we would have such fun-for though my husband
has often said that none of my family must come here, as he
wanted me to forget all their ways, yet as you are here, I
think I could coax him to let you stop. Sit down, Joe--
here's a chair. Well, and so—and how's your mother?
Joe. Hearty.
Mar. And what's the news?-tell me all you can think of.
Has Tom Dixon married Lizzie Turvey yet?
Joe. No; they were going to be married only a week ago,
and when they got to the church Tom took fright and ran all
the way home again, and left Lizzie Turvey crying her eyes
out at the porch door.
Mar. You don't say so! Well, I always said Tom was a
fool. How comfortable this is, to have somebody to talk to
in one's own fashion! I do feel so free and easy again! Well,
and tell me, Joe, is Dame Willows living?
Joe. No-died six months ago.
Mar. Did she leave all her money to her nephew, Jem Porter?
Joe. No, bless your life! Oh, there's such work!
Mar. Come, go on!-go on! and tell me.
Joe. You see, Jem made sure of the money, and lived in

Tom Hammer, the blacksmith ?
Mar. Yes.
Joe. Well, if he ain't gone and bought all Merryweather's
pigs, I'm a Dutchman! And Merryweather 's gone to America,
and the eldest daughter's married Sam Holloway, the cutler,

with three children, and she might have had Master Pollard

he's in prison; and Johnny Trotter, the postman, has
opened a grocer's shop; and they've pulled down the old

a large lamp over his door, with big blue and red bull's eyes;

me, or I shall tumble down and break something!"
Mar. Yes! and Joe, when my father used to take you and
I to market, and we used to sit at the bottom of the cart and
eat apples.
Joe. And when sometimes I used to try to give you a kiss,
what knocks on my nose you used to give!

in time, you will not be ashamed of me. When you want me
to learn, teach me yourself—a loving word and gentle patience,

A DARK NIGHTS WORK.
NIGEL became more interested in the volume at the second
than at the first attempt which he made to peruse it. The
narratives, strange and shocking as they were to human feel-
ing, possessed yet the interest of sorcery or of fascination
which rivets the attention by its awakening horrors. Much
was told of the strange and horrible acts of blood by which
men, setting nature and humanity alike at defiance, had, for
the thirst of revenge, the lust of gold, or the cravings of irre-
gular ambition, broken into the tabernacle of life. Yet more
surprising and mysterious tales were recounted of the mode
in which such deeds of blood had come to be discovered and
revenged. Animals, irrational animals, had told the secret,
and birds of the air had carried the matter. The elements
had seemed to betray the deed which had polluted them-
carth had ceased to support the murderer's steps, fire to
warm his frozen limbs, water to refresh his parched
lips, air to relieve his gasping lungs. All, in short, bore
evidence to the homicide's guilt. In other circumstances,
the criminal's own awakened conscience pursued and brought
him to justice; and in some narratives the grave was said
to have yawned, that the ghost of the sufferer might call for
revenge.
It was now wearing late in the night, and the book was
still in Nigel's hands, when the tapestry which hung behind
him flapped against the wall, and the wind produced by its
motion waved the flame of the candles by which he was read-
ing. Nigel started and turned round, in that excited and
irritated state of mind which arose from the nature of his
studies, especially at a period when a certain degree of super-
stition was inculcated as a point of religious faith.

meagre form, and ghastly aspect of old Trapbois, once more
in the very act of extending his withered hand towards the
table which supported his arms. Convinced by this untimely
apparition that something evil was meditated towards him,
Nigel sprung up, seized his sword, drew it, and, placing it at
the old man's breast, demanded of him what he did in his
apartment at so untimely an hour. Trapbois shewed neither
fear nor surprise, and only answered by some imperfect
expressions, intimating he would part with his life rather
than with his property; and Lord Glenvarlock, strangely
embarrassed, knew not what to think of the intruder's
motives, and still less how to get rid of him. As he again
tried the means of intimidation, he was surprised by a
second apparition from behind the tapestry, in the person
of the daughter of Trapbois, bearing a lamp in her hand.
She also seemed to possess her father's insensibility to
danger, for, coming close to Nigel, she pushed aside impe-
tuously his naked sword, and even attempted to take it out
of his hand.
“For shame,” she said; “your sword on a man of eighty
years and more!—this the honour of a Scottish gentleman!
give it to me to make a spindle of !”
“ Stand back," said Nigel; “I mean your father no injury-
but I will know what has caused him to prowl this whole day,
and even at this late hour, around my arms."
56 Your arms!” repeated she; “ alas, young man, the whole
arms in the Tower of London are of little value to him, in
comparison with this miserable piece of gold which I left this
morning on the table of a young spendthrift, too careless to
put what belonged to him into his own purse.
So saying she shewed the piece of gold, which, still remain-
ing on the table where she had left it, had been the bait
that attracted old Trapbois so frequently to the spot; and
which, even in the silence of the night, had so dwelt on
his imagination, that he had made use of a private passage
long disused to enter his guest's apartment, in order to
possess himself of the treasure during his slumbers. He
now exclaimed, at the highest tones of his cracked and feeble
voice-
“ It is mine-it is mine!-be gave it to me for a considera-
tion—I will die ere I part with my property!”
“It is indeed his own, mistress," said Nigel, “and I do
entreat you will • restore it to the person on whom I have
bestowed it, and let me have my apartment in quiet.
“ I will account with you for it, then," said the maiden,

reluctantly giving to her father the morsel of Mammon, on
which he darted as if his bony fingers had been the talons of
a hawk seizing its prey; and then making a contented mut-
tering and mumbling, like an old dog after he has been fed,
and just when he is wheeling himself thrice round for the
purpose of lying down, he followed his daughter behind the
tapestry, through a little sliding door, which was perceived
when the hangings were drawn apart.
“ This shall be properly fastened to-morrow," said the
daughter to Nigel, speaking in such a tone that her father,
deaf, and engrossed by his acquisition, could not hear her;
“ to-night I will continue to watch him closely-I wish you
good repose.”
These few words, pronounced in a tone of more civility than
she had yet made use of towards her lodger, contained a wish
which was not to be accomplished, although her guest, pre-
sently after her departure, retired to bed.
There was a slight fever in Nigel's blood, occasioned by the
various events of the evening, which put him, as the phrase
is, beside his rest. Perplexing and painful thoughts rolled on
his mind like a troubled stream, and the more he laboured to
lull himself to slumber, the further he seemed from attaining
his object. He tried all the resources common in such cases;
kept counting from one to a thousand, until his head was
giddy-he watched the embers of the wood fire till his eyes
were dazzled-he listened to the dull moaning of the wind,
the swinging and creaking of signs which projected from the
houses, and the baying of here and there a homeless dog, till
his very ear was weary.
Suddenly, however, amid this monotony, came a sound
which startled him at once. It was a female shriek. He sat
up in his bed to listen, then remembered he was in Alsatia,
where brawls of every sort were current among the unruly
inhabitants. But another scream, and another, and another,
succeeded so close, that he was certain, though the noise was
remote and sounded stifled, it must be in the same house with
himself.
Nigel jumped up hastily, put on a part of his clothes, seized
his sword and pistols, and ran to the door of his chamber.
Here he plainly heard the screams redoubled, and, as he
thought, the sounds came from the usurer's apartment. All
access to the gallery was effectually excluded by the interme-
diate door, which the brave young lord shook with eager but
vain impatience. But the secret passage occurred suddenly
to his recollection. He hastened back to his room, and suc

ceeded with some difficulty in lighting a candle, powerfully
agitated by hearing the cries repeated, yet still more afraid
lest they should sink into silence.
He rushed along the narrow and winding entrance, guided
by the noise, which now burst more wildly on his ear; and,
while he descended a narrow staircase which terminated the
passage, he heard the stifled voices of men, encouraging,
as it seemed, each other.—“Strike her down-silence her
-beat her, brains out!”—while the voice of his hostess,
though now almost exhausted, was repeating the cry of
Murder,” and “Help.” At the bottom of the staircase
was a small door, which gave way before Nigel as he pre-
cipitated himself upon the scene of action,-a cocked pistol
in one hand, a candle in the other, and his naked sword under
66
his arm.
Two ruffians had, with great difficulty, overpowered, or
rather, were on the point of overpowering, the daughter of
Trapbois, whose resistance appeared to have been most des-
perate, for the floor was covered with fragments of her clothes
and handfuls of her hair. It appeared that her life was about
to be the price of her defence, for one villain had drawn a long
clasp knife, when they were surprised by the entrance of
Nigel, who, as they turned towards him, shot the fellow with
the knife dead on the spot; and, when the other advanced to
him, hurled the candlestick at his head, and then attacked
him with his sword. It was dark, save some pale moonlight
from the window; and the ruffian, after firing a pistol, with-
out effect, and fighting a traverse or two with his sword, lost
heart, made for the window, leaped over it, and escaped.
Nigel fired his remaining pistol after him at a venture, and
then called for light.
“ There is light in the kitchen," answered Martha Trapbois,
with more presence of mind than could have been expected.
“Stay, you know not the way; I will fetch it myself.-Oh !
my father--my poor father !—I knew it would come to this
and all along of the accursed gold — They have MURDERED
him !”—Sir Walter Scott.

Flash'd all at once in air,
Startling the people there,
While upon every stair,
Swift footsteps thunder'd.
Plunging through steam and smoke
Blinded with dust of coke,
Watching each engine stroke,
Up and down platforms still
Folks ran and blunder'd.
Then they rushed back, but not,
Not the Six Hundred.
Goods trains to right of them,
Excursions to left of them,
Cattle behind them bellow'd and thunder'd.
Storm'd at with bell and yell,
Thinking it quite a sell,
Losing their only train,
Taunting their fate in vain,

ENOCH ARDEN.
[By kind permission of Messrs. A. STRAHAN & Co.]
Now when the dead man come to life beheld
His wife his wife no more, and saw the babe
Hers, yet not his, upon the father's knee,
And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,
And his own children tall and beautiful,
And him, that other, reigning in his place,
Lord of his rights, and of his children's love,-
He stagger'd and shook, holding the branch ;-and fear'd
To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,
Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,
Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.
He therefore turning softly like a thief,
Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,
And feeling all along the garden wall,
Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,
Crept to the gate, and open'd it, and closed,
As lightly as a sick man's chamber door
Behind him, and came out upon the waste.
And there he would have knelt, but that his knees
Were feeble, so that falling prone, he dug
His fingers into the wet earth, and pray'd.
- Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?
O God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou
That did’st uphold me on my lonely isle,
Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness

A little longer! aid me, give me strength
Not to tell her, never to let her know.
Help me not to break in
upon
her
peace.
My children too! must I not speak to these?
They know me not. I should betray myself.
Never: no father's kiss for me—the girl
So like her mother, and the boy, my son.”
Their speech and thought and nature fail'd a little,
And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced
Back toward his solitary home again,
All down the long and narrow street he went
Beating it in upon his weary brain,
As tho it were the burthen of a song,
“ Not to tell her, never to let her know.”
For thro' that dawning gleam'd a kindlier hope
On Enoch, thinking “after I am gone,
Then may she learn I loved her to the last.”
He call’d aloud for Miriam Lane and said,
“ Woman, I have a secret-only swear,
Before I tell you—swear upon the book
Not to reveal it, till you see me dead.”
Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,
“Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?"
“ Know him?" she said “I knew him far
away.
Ay, ay, I mind him coming down the street;
Held his head high, and cared for no man, he.”
Slowly and sadly Enoch answer'd her;
“His head is low, and no man cares for him.
I think I have not three days more to live;
I am the man.”
Then he told her of his voyage,
His wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,
His gazing in on Annie, his resolve,
And how he kept it.
“ Mark me and understand.
While I have power to speak. I charge you now
shall see her, tell her that I died
Blessing her, praying for her, loving her;
Save for the bar between us, loving her
As when she laid her head beside my own.
And tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw
So like her mother, that my latest breath
Was spent in blessing her and praying for her.
And tell my son that I died blessing him.

And say to Philip that I blest him too;
He never meant us anything but good.
But if my children care to see me dead,
Who hardly knew me living, let them come,
I am their father; but she must not come,
For my dead face would vex her after-life.
And now there is but one of all my blood,
Who will embrace me in the world-to-be:
This hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,
And I have borne it with me all these years,
And thought to bear it with me to my grave;
But now my mind is changed, for I shall see jim,
My babe in bliss: wherefore, when I am gor,
Take, give her this, for it may
comfort her:
It will moreover be a token to her,
That I am he.”
Then the third night after this,
While Enoch slumber'd motionless and pale,
And Miriam watch'd and dozed at intervals,
There came so loud a calling of the sea,
That all the houses in the haven rang.
He woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad
Crying with a loud voice “ A SAIL! A SAIL!
I AM SAVED;" and so fell back and spoke no more.

CHARLOTTE CORDAY.
[By kind permission of THOMAS CARLYLE, Esq.]
It is yellow July evening, we say, the thirteenth of the
month; eve of the Bastile day,—when“ M. Marat,” four years
ago, in the crowd of the Pont Neuf, shrewdly required of that
Besenval Hussar-party, which had such friendly dispositions,
“to dismount, and give up their arms, then;" and became nota-
ble among Patriot men. Four years: what a road he has
travelled ; -and sits now, about half-past seven of the clock,
stewing in slipper-bath; sore afflicted; ill of Revolution Fever,
--of what other malady this History had rather not name.
Excessively sick and worn, poor man; with precisely eleven-
pence-halfpenny of ready money, in paper; with slipper-bath; ;
strongthree-footed stool for writing on, the while; and a squalid

ment in Medical-School Street; thither and not elsewither has

his road led him. Not to the reign of Brotherhood and Perfect
Felicity; yet surely on the way towards that !Hark! a rap
again! A musical woman's voice, refusing to be rejected: it
is the Citoyenne who would do France a service. Marat, re-
cognizing from within, cries,“ Admit her." Charlotte Corday is
admitted.
As for Charlotte Corday, her work is accomplished; the
recompense of it is near and sure. The chère amie, and
neighbours of the house, flying at her, she “overturns some
movables,” entrenches herself till the gendarmes arrive; then
quietly surrenders; goes quietly to the Abbaye Prison: SHE
ALONE QUIET, all Paris sounding, in wonder, in rage or admira-
tion, round her. Duperret is put in arrest, on account of her;
his Papers sealed—which may lead to consequences. Fauchet, in
like manner; though Fauchet had not so much as heard of her.
Charlotte, confronted with these two Deputies, praises the
grave firmness of Duperret, censures the dejection of Fauchet.
On Wednesday morning, the thronged Palais de Justice
and Revolutionary Tribunal can see her face; beautiful and
calm: she dates it “fourth day of the Preparation of Peace.”
A strange murmur ran through the Hall, at sight of her;
you could not say of what character. Tinville has his
indictments and tape-papers; the cutler of the Palais Royal
will testify that he sold her the sheath-knife: “ All these
details are needless,” interrupted Charlotte; “IT IS I THAT
KILLED MARAT." By whose instigation?—“By no one's.”
What tempted you, then? 66 His crimes. I killed one man,"
added she, raising her voice extremely (extrêmement), as they
went on with their questions, “I killed one man to save a
hundred thousand; a villain to save innocents; a savage wild-
beast to give repose to my country. I was a Republican
before the Revolution; I never wanted energy."
There is
therefore nothing to be said. The public gazes astonished:
the hasty limners sketch her features, Charlotte not disap-
proving: the men of law proceed with their formalities.
The doom is DEATH AS A MURDERES$. To her Advocate she
gives thanks; in gentle phrase, in high-flown classical spirit.
To the Priest they send her she gives thanks; but needs not
any shriving, any ghostly or other aid from him.
On this same evening therefore, about half past seven o'clock,
from the gate of the Conciergerie, to a City all on tiptoe, the
fatal Cart issues; seated on it a fair young creature, sheeted in
red smock of Murderess; so beautiful, serene, so full of life;
journeying towards death, -alone amid the World. Many také
off their hats, saluting reverently; for what heart but must be

touched ? Others growl and howl. Adam Lux, of Metz,
declares that she is greater than Brutus; that it were beautiful
to die with her;
the head of this young man seems turned. At
the Place de la Révolution, the countenance of Charlotte wears
the same still smile. The executioners proceed to bind her
feet; she resists, thinking it meant as an insult; on a word of
explanation, she submits with cheerful apology! As the last
act, all being now ready, they take the neckerchief from her
neck; a blush of maidenly shame overspreads that fair face and
neck; the cheeks were still tinged with it when the executioner
lifted the severed head, to shew it to the people. “It is most
true,” says Forster," that he struck the cheek insultingly; for
I saw it with my eyes: the Police imprisoned him for it."
In this manner have the Beautifulest and the Squalidest come
in collision, and extinguished one another. Jean-Paul Marat
and Marie Anne Charlotte Corday both, suddenly, are no more.
“Day of Preparation of Peace?” Alas, how were peace
possible or preparable, while, for example, the hearts of lovely
Maidens, in their convent stillness, are dreaming not of Love-
paradises and the light of life, but of Codrus'-sacrifices and
Death well-earned? That Twenty-five million hearts have got
to such temper, this is the Anarchy; the soul of it lies in this;
whereof not peace can be the embodiment! The death of
Marat whetting old animosities tenfold, will be worse than any
Oye hapless Two, mutually extinctive, the Beautiful
and the Squalid, sleep ye well, -in the Mother's bosom that
bore
youl
both !
This is the History of Charlotte Corday; most definite,
most complete; angelic-dæmonic: like a Star! Adam Lux
goes home, half delirious; to pour forth his Apotheosis of her
in paper and print; to propose that she have a statue with this
inscription, Greater than Brutus. Friends represent his danger:
Lux is reckless; thinks it were beautiful to die with her.-

You do allure, with success sure,

You have the heart, besides the art,
Of spying all the honey
In ev'ry flow'r about your bow'r,
Should it be dark or sunny.
And while you tell, with magic spell,
The weak points (not in thunders),
We drink them up in sugar'd cup,
The physic working wonders.
You've taught us when, and yet again,
Our lung power to restrain,
At passage soft, nor soar aloft
When we should quiet remain.
And like a pin, to shew therein
The point of ev'ry word;
Nor by address to make a mess
With emphasis absurd.
At commas keep the voice from sleep,
A moment pausing there;
But colons bold require a hold
Two seconds—to make them square.
We change the voice, from tasteful choice,
At paragraphs and breaks,
As rule will shew, by which we go

For Roman right! though none, it seems, dare stand
To take their share with me. Ay, cluster there!
Cling to your master,-judges, Romans, slaves!
His charge is false! - I dare bim to his proofs.
You have
my answer: let
my
actions speak !
Cic. Deeds shall convince you! Has the traitor done?
Cat. But this I will avow, that I have scorned,
And still do scorn, to hide my sense of wrong;
Who brands me on the forehead, breaks my sword,
Or lays the bloody scourge upon my back,
Wrongs me not half so much as he who shuts
The gates of honour on me,-turning out
The Roman from his birthright,-and for what
To fling your offices to every slave;
Vipers, that creep where man disdains to climb;
And having wound their loathsome track to the top
Of this huge mouldering monument of Rome,
Hang hissing at the nobler men below.
Cic. This is his answer ! Must I bring more prcofs?
Fathers, you know their lives not one of us,
But lives in peril of his midnight sword.
Lists of proscription have been handed round,
In which your properties are made
Your murderer's hire.
Fathers of Rome! If.men can be convinced
By proof, as clear as daylight, here it is !
Look on these letters ! Here's a deep-laid plot
To wreck the province; a solemn league,
Made with all form and circumstance. The time
Is desperate,—all the slaves are up,-Rome shakes :-
The heavens alone can tell how near our
We stand even here! The name of Catiline
Is foremost in the league. He was their king.
Tried and convicted traitor! Go from Rome!
Cat. Come, consecrated lictors, from your
thrones!
Fling down your sceptres !-take the rod and axe,
And make the murder, as you make the law!

A STORM AT SEA.

“ Don't you think that,” I asked the coachman, in the first
stage out of London, “a very remarkable sky? I don't re-
member to have seen one like it."
“Nor I-not equal to it,” he replied. “That's wind, sir.

There'll be mischief done at sea, I expect, before long."

As the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely
overspreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on
to blow harder. It increased until our horses could scarcely
face the wind. Many times, in the dark part of the night, we
were often in serious apprehensions that the coach would
be blown over. Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this
storm, like showers of steel; and, at those times, when there
was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got, we were fain to
stop, in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle.
As we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which
this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore, its force became
more and more terrific. Long before we saw the sea, its spray
was on our lips, and showered salt rain upon us. The water
was out, over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent
to Yarmouth; and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks,
and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us.
When we came within sight of the sea, the waves on the
horizon, caught at intervals above the rolling abyss, were like
glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings. When
at last we got into the town, the people came out to their
doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair, making a wonder
of the mail that had come through such a night.
Joining these groups, I found bewailing women whose
husbands were away in herring boats, which there was too
much reason to think might have foundered before they could
run in anywhere for safety. Grizzled sailors were among
the
people shaking their heads, as they looked from water to
sky, and muttering to one another.
I went back to the inn. If such a wind could rise, I think
it was rising. The howl and roar, the rattling of the doors and
windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking
of the very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious
tumult of the sea, were more fearful than in the morning.
I could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue
steadfast to anything. Something within me, faintly answer-
ing to the storm without, tossed up the depths of my memory,
and made a tumult in them. Yet, in all the hurry of my
thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea—the storm
and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-
ground.
I went to bed. I have an impression that for a long time,
though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes,
it was always blowing in my dream. At length, I lost that
feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with two dear
friends, at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading.

A STORM AT SEA.
195
The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant, that I
could not hear something I much desired to hear, until I made
a great exertion and awoke. It was broad day-eight or nine
o'clock; the storm raging, in lieu of the batteries; and some
one knocking and calling at my door.
“ What is the matter?” I cried.
“ A WRECK! Close by.!"
The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; “A
WRECK! A WRECK ! A WRECK !” and I wrapped myself in my
clothes as quickly as I could, and ran into the street. Numbers
of people were there before me, all running in one direction
to the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many,
and soon came facing the wild sea. The sea, having upon it
the additional agitation of the whole night, was infinitely
more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every appearance
it had then presented, bore the expression of being swelled ;
and the height to which the breakers rose, and, looking over
one another, bore one another down, and rolled in in inter-
minable hosts, was most appalling. I was so confused that I
looked out to sea for the wreck, and saw nothing but the
foaming heads of the great waves. A half-dressed boatman,
standing next to me, pointed with his bare arm. Then, O
great Heaven! I saw it, close in upon
The second mast
was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a wild
confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had
struck once. She was parting amidships. There was a great
cry of pity from the beach; four men arose with the wreck out
of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast ;
uppermost, an active figure with curling hair. There was a
bell on board. As the ship rolled and dashed, like a desperate
creature driven mad, the bell rang; and its sound—the knell
of those unhappy men—was borne towards us on the wind.
Again we lost her, and again she rose. Two men were gone.
The agony on shore increased : men groaned, and clasped their
hands, women shrieked, and turned away their faces. Some
ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying for “HELP”
where no help could be; I found myself one of these, fran-
tically imploring a knot of sailors whom I Ảnew, not to let
those two lost creatures perish before our eyes.
They were making out to me, in an agitated way, that the
lifeboat had been manned an hour ago, and could do nothing ;
and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to
wade off with a rope, and establish a communication with the
shore, there was nothing left to try, when saw them part,
and Ham come breaking through them to the front. I ran to
us !

him. The determination in his face, and his look out to sea
awoke me to a knowledge of his danger. I held him back
with both arms; and implored the men with whom I had
been speaking, not to listen to him, not to do murder, not to
let him stir from off that sand! Another cry arose on shore;
and looking to the wreck, we saw the cruel sail, with blow on
blow beat off the lower of the two men, and fly up in triumph
round the active figure left alone upon the mast.
“Mas'r Davy," Ham said, cheerily grasping me by both
hands, “ if my time is come, 'tis come; if 'tant, I'll bide it.
Lord above bless you, and bless all! Mates, make me ready!
I'm a going off !”
The wreck was breaking up. She was parting in the middle:
the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread;
still, he clung to it. He had a singular red cap on; and as the
few yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and
bulged, he was seen by all of us to wave it. I saw him do it,
and thought I was going distracted, when his action brought
an old rememberance to my mind of a once dear friend.
Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence
of suspended breath behind him, and the storm before, until
there was a great retiring wave; when, with a backward
glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round
his body, he dashed in after it, and in a moment was buffeting
with the water: rising with the hills, falling with the valleys,
lost beneath the foam. The distance was nothing; but the
power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly. At length
he neared the wreck. He was so near, that with one more of
his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it-when, a high,
green, vast hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from
beyond the ship, he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty
bound-and THE SHIP WAS GONE!
Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask
had been broken. Running to the spot where they were
hauling in, I saw consternation in
every
face. They drew him

HORATIUS.
197
By the Nine Gods he swore it, and named a trysting day,
And bade his messengers ride forth,
East and west and south and north,
To summon his array.
The Fathers of the City, they sat all night and day,
For every hour some horseman came with tidings of dismay.
“ Their van will be upon us before the bridge goes down;
And if they once may win the bridge, what hope to save the
town ?"
Then out spake brave Horatius,-the Captain of the Gate-
“ To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late:
And how can man die better than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods?
“Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may;
I—with two more to help me -will hold the foe in play.
In yon straight path a thousand may well be stopped by
three-
Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with
me?"

Then out spake Spurius Lartius—a Ramnian proud was he:
“ Lo, I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with
thee.'
And out spake strong Herminius--of Titian blood was he:
“I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee.”
“Horatius," quoth the Consul, “ As thou sayest, so let it be:
And straight against that great array forth went the daunt-
less Three.
But now no sound of laughter was heard among the foes;
A wild and wrathful clamour from all the vanguard rose.
But meanwhile axe and lever have manfully been plied ;
And now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.
“ Come back, come back, Horatius !" loud cried the Fathers
all,
“ Back, Lartius! back, Herminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"
Back darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back;
And, as they passed, beneath their feet, they felt the timbers
crack :
But with a crash like thunder fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the
stream:
And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,
As to the highest turret-tops was splashed the yellow foam.

Alone stood brave Horatius,—but constant still in mind,
Thrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind.
“Down with him!” cried false Sextus, with a smile on his
pale face.
“Now yield thee!" cried Lars Porsena, “Now yield thee to
our grace.”
Round turned he,
-as not deigning those craven ranks to see;
Nought spake he to Lars Porsena, to Sextus nought spake he;
But he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home;.
And he spake to the noble river that rolls by the towers of
Rome
Oh, Tiber ! father Tiber! to whom the Romans pray,
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms, take thou in charge this

So he spake, and speaking sheathed the good sword by his
side,
And with his harness on his back, plunged headlong in the
tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;
But friends and foes in dumb surprise,
With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank:
And when above the surges they saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer.
Never, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,
Struggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing-place;
But his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,
And our good father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.
And now he feels the bottom; now on dry earth he stands;
Now round him throng the Fathers to press
his
gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping
loud,
He enters through the River-Gate, borne by the joyous crowd.
When the goodman mends his armour,
and trims his helmet's
plume;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily goes flashing through the
loom;
With weeping and with laughter still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old.

DEBATE.
WHICH DOES THE MOST TO MAKE THE ORATOR-KNOWLEDGE,
NATURE, OR ART?
Eleven Speakers.
[By kind permission of Messrs. LONGMAN & Co.]
Opener. THE question which I have had the honour to
propose cannot fail to be both interesting and instructive
to us.
I seek to know whether the Orator owes his power
and success to his Knowledge, to his Natural genius, or to
his study of the Art of Speech? I am of opinion that the
Orator owes most to Nature. The gift of speech is as much a
talent as the gift of music or any other talent with which a man
is born. Experience is the ground on which I build my belief.
How often do you see a man who knows a subject thoroughly,
and yet cannot say five consecutive words upon it: whilst, on
the other hand, how frequently do you find that a man, only
slightly versed in the same topic, will make you a striking
speech upon it, full of wit, grace, and eloquence! That the
power of speech is a gift of Nature, is proverbial: and, in my
opinion, justly so; for observation continually shews us that
even in early youth, when knowledge is scanty, the faculty is
often strikingly developed; whilst in the maturity of manly
age, when knowledge is full, and (as far as earth can make it
so) complete, the faculty is frequently altogether absent. And
as to Art: How very common and numerous are the instances
where, after instructing a young man in elocution, till he has
practised as long (and almost as painfully) as Demosthenes, he
starmers and stutters so dreadfully if he bave a sentence or
two to say, that you feel quite a pain and pity for him; whilst,
on the contrary, you continually find that men who have
never been taught the Art of Speech at all, become accom-
plished and striking Orators! These instances seem to me
quite sufficient to prove that Oratory is a natural, and not an
acquired power.
Second Speaker. Our friend who has opened this debate, has
spoken so very slightingly of the Art of speech, that I feel
(although the humblest champion of the cause) obliged to
venture a word or two in its defence. In my opinion it is
Art to which the Orator is mainly indebted for his success.
I take as an instance of the value of Art, the case of Demos-
thenes. This great Orator, the greatest that the world has
ever seen, was originally so vile a speaker, that his audiences


## p. 200 (#216) ############################################

200

hissed him from their presence. Now he had genius, for a
greater mind never existed: and Knowledge, for he had been
instructed by the wisest philosophers: but being deficient in
Art, he was so graceless and unpleasing that men would not
listen to him. When, however, he devoted himself to the
study of the Art, he conquered his defects, and won not
merely contemporary applause (which is the total meed of
most orators), but the applause and admiration of the whole
world until now.
Third Speaker. Sir, I am of opinon that it is neither to
Nature nor to Art that the success of an Orator is owing, but
to Knowledge. Take three different men; a man of plain
practical Knowledge, a man of lofty Genius, and a man of
consummate Art; and give them a subject to debate. You
will find, that whilst the man of Genius thrills and delights
you with his eloquence, whilst the man of Art enchants you
with his elegance of action and delivery, the man of Know-
ledge is the one who in the end convinces you. Genius
without Knowledge is dazzling, but useless; Art without
Knowledge is empty and vain ; but Knowledge without either
Art or Genius, can still be of service to truth, and still
acquire respect from all men.
Fourth Speaker. Sir, I really cannot understand how the
gentleman who spoke before the last speaker can fancy that
Art is superior to Nature in Oratory. Why, what is Art?
Simply the copy of nature. What is great, effective, elegant,
striking, and graceful in natural speech has been formed into
a code by observant men, and this is the derivation of the art
of Oratory! Now, surely, the original must be greater than
the imitation ! Surely the Genius must be greater than the
Art! Look to the rules of the Art themselves, and you
will
find the admission there. For what is the first maxim of the
Elocution Teacher ? “ Be natural;” “Study nature ;'
." “ Be in
earnest." What is this but a direct admission that Nature is
the great Orator, after all, and that Genius is greater than
Art, and is its model? This is all I have to say, sir, on the
subject.
Fifth Speaker. Sir, Power is of no value without impetus.
A Steam Engine may be of great strength; but without fuel
it is worthless, and without guidance it can do no work. Just
in like manner, a man of genius is useless without Knowledge,
and ineffective without Art. Mere greatness is nothing, and
can do nothing; it is like a perfect lamp unfilled and un-
trimmed. Now, it is very difficult to say whether we are
most indebted for the light to the lamp, to the oil, or to the
a

2
trimming. Without the oil the lamp could not be lighted ;
without the lamp the oil would be of no service; and without
the trimming, the lamp would burn so ill as to be nearly use-
less, and very disagreeable. As I must choose between the
three sources of the Orator's success, I give my vote for Know-
I
ledge. For as it is the oil which is the real source of light, no
matter what the lamp may be, so it is Knowledge that is
the true illuminator of speech, no matter who may be the
utterer.
Sixth Speaker. I think it is Rousseau who says that Oratory
requires such a combination of qualities that he wonders how
any man dares to open his mouth in public. “ Combination of
qualities:" mark that phrase ! qualities, not acquirements, are
needed by the Orator : qualities of genius, not qualities com-
municated by knowledge. Insight, judgment, comparison,
method, boldness, and constructiveness; these are the quali:
ties on which a man depends in Oratory; and these, you will
observe, are all born gifts, and not acquired faculties. It
follows, therefore, that to Genius, or Nature, the Orator is
mainly indebted. Genius without Art will make a man a
better speaker than Art without Genius : for Genius will
always give eloquence, whilst Art at the most can only give
fluency. Genius is the possession of mental power: Art is only
the means of its development. Genius is the stream, and Art
the channel : it needs no logic to prove that Genius must be
the greater of the two: for as a stream will make itself a
channel, whatever may obstruct it, so Genius will find for
itself a means of development, however great and numerous
may be the difficulties in its way.
Seventh Speaker. Sir, I am inclined to think that a very impor-
tant cause of an Orator's success has been hitherto quite over-
looked. I think that to confidence a speaker is very deeply
indebted for his triumphs. Many a man who possesses all the
other sources of power referred to- Genius, Knowledge, and
the theory of Art-is so abashed and confused when he begins
to speak, that, with all his talent, his attempts end in failure;
whilst, on the contrary, you often find that a man who
possesses this quality of confidence succeeds in winning the
attention and applause of his audience, although he is neither
a man of Genius, nor of Knowledge, nor of Taste. Now, I
presume, that this quality of confidence is a gift of nature, a
peculiarity of constitution. Some men are naturally timid,
others naturally brave : the timid ones, of course, will be
nervous, apprehensive, and abashed when they address an
audience; whilst the brave ones will be bold and courageous.
.

202
NEW CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION.
Oratory, then, depends mainly on nature, I believe : as a
man is naturally constituted, so will he be able, or unable
to speak.
Eighth Speaker. The last speaker has told us, sir, that it is
to confidence, and to mental and physical constitution, that
the Orator owes most of his success: let me say a few words
to you on this point. Now I think that confidence is not a
gift of nature at all, and has nothing whatever to do with man's
constitution. Confidence depends partly on Knowledge, and
partly on Practice, or Art. Many men are nervous because
they fear that they shall break down: this must result from a
want of confidence in their knowledge. How can they fear
failure, if they knew they could prove the truth of what they
have to say? But I think that the chief cause of nervousness
in speaking is want of practice. The voice sounds strangely to
a young speaker: he does not know it: the many faces he sees
before him, all looking at him, cause his bewilderment:
memory fails him, he becomes perplexed, forgetful, and
incoherent: hence he fails. But practice remedies all this.
He gets used to the sound of his voice, and to the attention
of his auditors: he feels less trepidation every time he speaks,
his memory improves, and gathers strength by exercise: his
thoughts arise more continuously and more regularly, and he
becomes able at length to utter his thoughts with certainty and
effect. The debt he owes to Art is a very great one, even in
a physical point of view. Art improves, strengthens, and
tunes his voice; drills his body into proper postures; gives
elegance to his action and dignity to his appearance; and
corrects the faults of his utterance.
Ninth Speaker. Sir, I think that success in Oratory depends
more upon moral character than upon Genius, Knowledge, or
Art. The man of truth, of rectitude, and of goodness, is the
greatest Orator after all. For moral goodness gives con-
sciousness of right; consciousness gives earnestness; earnest-
ness gives eloquence; and eloquence never fails to find
striking language and impressive action. How was it that
the oratory of Paul made Felix tremble? Not because the
apostle was an orator“ stamped by nature," as one gentleman
said; for he was a mean-looking, and, I believe, deformed
man; but because he spoke with the fervour and earnestness
which always attend conviction, of “righteousness and the
world to come.” There was no Genius in this : there was no
Art in it: but it was simply the moral conviction of a true-
hearted man flashing out of his soul. And thus you will
always find that earnest and good men are eloquent men.

I do not say "fluent;" fluency is not eloquence, by any
means : fluency belongs to words, eloquence to thought. Give
a man a subject which engages his whole heart and soul, and
whether he be educated or uneducated, a genius or an artist, a
man of universal knowledge, or a man of limited experience,
you
will see that he will speak well and forcibly and effectively
upon that subject whenever he treats of it. I have a far
greater faith in moral conviction than in intellectual strength,
stores of knowledge, or artistical perfection: the Orator who
speaks from the heart is the only true Orator: the only
Orator whose fame will really last. With these sentiments.
Sir, I must be excused from giving a vote upon this question,
Tenth Speaker. Sir, with all due respect to the gentleman
who cited Demosthenes as a proof of the value of Art in
Oratory, I must be allowed to express my opinion that the
great Orator referred to, owed less to Art than we (some of us)
imagine. Art led him to conquer many natural defects and
difficulties : but it was the perception and conviction of the
Genius within him, that induced him to study Art as he did.
Unless it can be shewn that the same amount of study would
make a man a Demosthenes, it must be admitted that
Demosthenes was an Orator naturally superior to other men;
and consequently that on Nature, more than Art, oratorical
success depends. When he said, 6 LET US MARCH AGAINST
PHILIP: LET US CONQUER OR DIE,” it was not the blazing eye,
not the energetic arm, not the loud voice, not the determined
manner of the speaker that led the vast crowd he addressed
to echo his appeal: it was the sentiment, the truth he uttered,
that aroused his auditors. His soul saw and spoke to their
souls: and the manner was nothing, as compared with the
matter of his speech. Upon Nature, therefore, acting upon
knowledge, the success of the Orator seems entirely to depend.
These, sir, are my opinons on this subject.
Eleventh Speaker. Sir, it appears to me that Demosthenes
himself opposes the arguments of his defenders and champions.
They maintain that success in Oratory depends on genius; he
on the contrary asserts that it depends on Art. What is the
first requisite in an Orator? he was asked. Action, was his
reply. What the second $ Action. What the third ? Action.
By Action he here means Elocution, or the Art of delivery.
If, then, it is the opinion of the greatest master of speech
ever known, that Art does more for the Orator than Nature,
how can we suppose or contend that Nature is superior to
Art? To Art, therefore, I give the highest place. Taught by
Art, the student will gather wisdom, enlarge his mind,

cultivate his perception, exercise his imagination, strengthen
bis memory, accumulate ideas, supply himself with facts and
illustrations, practise himself in logic, proof, and philosophy,
observe the emotions of feeling and passion, learn how to
portray them, and beyond all this, train his mind into habits
of thought and virtue, and his physical powers into pliancy,
gracefulness, and strength. This, you may depend, will make
a man a far greater Orator than he will become under the mere
impulse of genius, or aided by the most extended human
knowledge.
Opener (in reply). Sir, I have been led by this debate to
see that excellence in Oratory depends not upon any one of
the elements to which my question refers, but upon all. Mere
genius will never make an Orator: nor will mere Knowledge;
nor will mere Art; it is only by the union of the three that a
successful Orator can be formed. I would not bestow too
much attention upon Art; for it has a tendency to mechanize
and unspiritualize the mind: but I would keep it in its due
place, and perpetually fix attention upon the more important
elements beyond it. Above all, I would instruct the mind of
the student in truth and virtue. I would say to him, “Let
truth be your aim, and to that, and that only, bow. You
have but one cause to serve: yes, understand me well! you
must serve the cause of goodness, and that cause alone, or
your acquirements will be a curse to you rather than a bless-

SIR PETER. LADY TEAZLE.
Sir P. WHEN an old bachelor marries a young wife,
what
is he to expect? 'Tis now six months since Lady Teazle
made me the happiest of men—and I have been the most
miserable dog ever since! We tiffed a little going to church,
and fairly quarrelled before the bells had done ringing. I
was more than once nearly choked with gall during the honey-
moon, and had lost all comfort in life before my friends had

done wishing me joy. Yet I chose with caution-a girl bred
wholly in the country, who never knew luxury beyond one
silk gown, nor dissipation above the annual gala of a race-
ball. Yet now she plays' her part in all the extravagant
fopperies of the fashion and the town, with as ready a grace
as if she had never seen a bush or a grass-plot out of Grosvenor
Square! I am sneered at by all my acquaintance, and para-
graphed in the newspapers. She dissipates my fortune, and
contradicts all my humours; yet, the worst of it is, I doubt
I love her, or I should never bear all this. However, I'll
never be weak enough to own it. Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle,
I'll not bear it!
Lady T. Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, as
you please; but I ought to have my own way in everything,
and what's more, I will, too.
Sir P. Very well, ma'am, very well ;-so a husband is to
have no influeuce, no authority?
Lady T. Authority! no to be sure;-if you wanted authority
over me, you should have adopted me and not married me:
I am sure you were old enough.
Sir P. Old enough —ay, there it is. Well, well, Lady
Teazle, though my life may be made unhappy by your temper,
I'll not be ruined by your extravagance.
Lady T. My extravagance! I'm sure, I'm not more ex-
travagant than a woman of fashion ought to be.
Sir P. No, no, madam, you shall throw away no more sums
on such unmeaning luxury. 'Slife! to spend as much to
furnish
your
dressing-room with flowers in winter, as would
suffice to turn the Pantheon into a green-house, and give a
fête champêtre at Christmas, but you forget what your situation
was when I married you.
Lady T. No, no, I don't; 'twas a very disagreeable one, or I
should never have married you. O, yes! I remember it very
well, and a curious life I led. My daily occupation to inspect
the dairy, superintend the poultry, make extracts from the
family receipt-book, and—comb my aunt Deborah's lap-dog.
Sir P. I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes, madam,
these were the recreations I took you from; but now you
must have your coach-vis-à-vis—and three powdered foot-
men before your chair; and, in the summer, a pair of white
cats to draw you to Kensington gardens. No recollection, I
suppose, when you were content to ride double, behind the
butler, on a dock'd coach-horse?
Lady T. No-I swear I never did that: I deny the butler
and the coach-horse.

Sir P. You did! He was blind of one eye, and his name was
Dobbin. This madam, was your situation; and what have I
done for you? I have made you a woman of fashion, of for-
tune, of rank; in short, I have made you my wife.
Lady T. Well, then,-and there is but one thing more
you can make me, to add to the obligation, and that is-
Sir P. My widow, I suppose?
Lady T. Hem ! hem!
Sir P. I thank you, madam-but don't flatter yourself;
for though your ill-conduct may disturb my peace, it shall
never break my heart, I promise you; however, I am equally
obliged to you for the hint.
Lady T. Then why will you endeavour to make yourself
so disagreeable to me, and thwart me in every little elegant
expense?
Sir P. 'Slife, madam, I say, had you any of these little
elegant expenses when you married me?
Lady T. Lud, Sir Peter! would you have me be out of the
fashion?
Sir P. The fashion, indeed! what had you to do with the
fashion before you married me?
Lady T. For my part, I should think you would like to
have your wife thought a woman of taste.
Sir P. Ay—there again—taste-Zounds! madam, you had
no taste when you married me!
Lady T. That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter;—and after
having married you, I should never pretend to taste again, I
allow. Do be good-humoured now, and let me have two
hundred pounds, will you!
Sir P. Two hundred pounds! What, an't I to be in a good
humouſ without paying for it? But speak to me thus, and
i'faith there's nothing I could refuse you; you shall no longer
reproach me with not giving you an independent settlement.
I mean shortly to surprise you. But shall we always live
thus, hey?
Lady T. If f you please. I'm sure I don't care how soon we
leave off quarrelling, provided you 'll own you were tired first.
Sir P. Well-then let our future contest be, who shall be
most obliging.
Lady T. I assure you, Sir Peter, good nature becomes you
-you look now as you did before we were married, when
you used to walk with me under the elms, and tell me stories
of what a gallant you were in your youth, and ask me if
I thought I could love an old fellow who would deny me
nothing-didn't you

Sir P. Yes, yes, and you were as kind and attentive to me
then-
Lady T. Ay-80 I was, and would always take your part,
when my acquaintance used to abuse you, and turn you into
ridicule.
Sir P. Indeed!
Lady T. Ay, and when my cousin Sophy has called you a
stiff, peevish old bachelor, and laughed at me for thinking of
marrying one who might be my father, I have always
defended you, and said, “ I didn't think you so ugly by any
means, and I dare say you'd make a very good sort of a
husband.”
Sir P. And you prophesied right, and we shall now be the
happiest couple-
Lady T. And never differ again?
Sir P. No, never, never, never!—though at the same time,
indeed, my dear Lady Teazle, you must watch your temper
very seriously; for in all our little quarrels, my dear, if you
recollect, my love, you always began first.
Lady T. I beg your pardon, my dear Sir Peter; indeed
you always gave the provocation.
Sir P. Now see, my angel take care-contradicting isn't
the way to keep friends.
Lady T. Then don't you begin it, my love!
Sir P. There, now! you—you are going on.
You don't
perceive, my life, that you are just doing the very thing which
you know always makes me angry.
Lady T. Nay, you know if you will be angry without any
reason, my dear-
Sir P. There! now you want to quarrel again.
Lady T. No, I am sure I don't; but if you will be so
peevish-
Sir P. There now! who begins first?
Lady T. Why you, to be sure. I said nothing—but there's
no bearing your temper.
Sir P. No, no, madam; the fault's in your own temper.
Lady T. Ay, you are just what my cousin Sophy said you
would be.
Sir P. Your cousin Sophy is a forward impertinent
gipsy.
Lady T. You are a great bear, I'm sure, to abuse my
relations.
Sir P. Now may all the plagues of marriage be doubled on
me, if ever I try to be friends with you any more!
Lady T. So much the better.

Sir P. No, no, madam; 'tis evident you never cared a pin
for me, and I was a madman to marry you—a pert, rural
coquette, that had refused half the honest 'squires in the
neighbourhood.
Lady T. And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you—an old
dangling bachelor, who was single at fifty, only because he
never could meet with any who would have him.
Sir P. Ay, ay, madam; but you were pleased enough to
listen to me; you never had such an offer before.
Lady T. No! didn't I refuse Sir Tivy Terrier, who every
body said would have been a better match? for his estate is
just as good as yours, and he has broke his neck since we
have been married.
Sir P. Oh! oh! oh! I have done with you, madam! You
are an unfeeling, ungrateful,—but there's an end of every-
thing. A separate maintenance as soon as you please. Yes,
madam, or a divorce !—I'll make an example of myself for the
benefit of all old bachelors—we will separate, madam.
Lady T. Agreed ! agreed !-And now, my dear Sir Peter,
we are of one mind once more, we may be the happiest
couple--and never differ again.
[Exit.]
Sir P. Plagues and tortures! Can't I make her angry
either! Oh, I am the most miserable fellow! but I'll not
bear her presuming to keep her temper: no! she may break
my heart, but she shan't keep her temper.

VICTIMS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
MR. HERBERT TOMLINSON was a widower with a grown-up
daughter, who was eighteen years older than himself. Mr.
Tomlinson was thirty years of age. Georgina, his daughter,
fat and fair, was forty-eight. Mr. Tomlinson had married for
money; his wife had departed a twelvemonth previously,
bequeathing him as her only legacy, her daughter by her
first husband. Under this incubus the hopes of her step-
father were perpetually withering. Georgina would persist in
always calling him “PAPA.” Georgina was always more dutiful
in this respect in the presence of young unmarried ladies, and
so devoted herself to Mr. Tomlinson that scarcely an hour in-
tervened in which parent and child were parted. Actuated, no
doubt, by feelings purely disinterested, Mr. Tomlinson en-
deavoured, as he said, "to marry her off;" but to no purpose.

a
In vain did he speak to gushing young strangers of having a
little “ Popsey
Popsey” at home: when brought face to face with
Georgina, the stoutest heart quailed. Mr. Tomlinson, tan.
talized by so many failures in contracting a matrimonial
engagement for his child, determined, as a last resource, to
negotiate nuptials for himself. But here he was doomed to be
discomfited. Georgina
Georgina was a bombshell, whose devastating
influence was felt far and wide. Whenever Mr. Tomlinson
presented his daughter to the object of his affections, there
was an end of him. Seven times had he been engaged, the
day actually fixed, when his daughter's age and appearance
shook, and finally shattered the promised heritage. Driven
to desperation, Mr. Tomlinson secretly engaged himself to a
young lady-Miss Ada Tumbleton—who lived with her
papa in a pretty cottage in a rural village in the west of Eng-
land.
Down in Devonshire Herbert and Ada were to be married.
Affairs had reached this desirable aspect of_consummation
when, on a bright autumn morning, Mr. Tomlinson was
equipped for a trip to Torquay, to be married the following
day. The cab was already in waiting to convey him to the
Great Western Terminus, when a loud double knock was
heard, and enquiring voices sounded in the hall.
“Mrs. Burnside,” whispered Tomlinson over the <a isters,
“ I'm not at home, mind! D’ye hear ? Not at home.”
It was too late.
“Not at home !" responded a rich, fat, lumbering voice,
“not at home; well said, son-in-law."
A heavy pair of large creaking boots, and the pattering of
two very small thin ones, were heard ascending the stairs,
and Mr. Thomas Tumbleton, accompanied by his daughter,
Miss Ada Tumbleton, entered the room.
“Aha, my porcupine !” exclaimed the owner of the boots,
"what do you say to this-you're not at home, are you?
Come and embrace us.”
Mr. Tomlinson obeyed, and, with his carpet-bag and
umbrella, shook hands extensively with Mr. Tumbleton's
carpet-bag and umbrella, and proceeded to perform a similar
congratulatory movement, but on a decidedly more circum-
scribed principle, with Miss Ada.
“Who'd have thought of seeing you here?” said Tom-
linson.
“I've just arrived from the terminus," said Tumbleton';
“ You know how ill I've been, only fancy, now," he
continued, sitting on the sofa, and spreading his two hands

over a white waistcoat of considerable dimensions, and
making quite a small tour round the regions adjoining.
“Every time I eat, and, indeed I may say every time I
don't eat, I feel a sort of amall down here, and then all
through here, and all round here, a kind of a__”
“What?” impatiently demanded Tomlinson.
“ That's the point! I don't know, my daughter don't
know, my doctor don't know; so Ada decided we should take
a trip to town, and that I should get cured at St. George's
Hospital, she should get married at St. George's Church, and
we'd stop at your house in the meantime.”
" What on earth 's to become of me?" thought Tomlinson,
“I shall have Georgina home in a minute !”
“ By-the-bye," said Tumbleton, seating himself in Tomlin-
son's easy chair, on one side of the fire-place, whilst Ada,
engaged in some mysterious needle-work, occupied the other.
“I've got a bone to pick with you, sir.”
“ Me?" echoed Tomlinson, with his back to the grate.
"You've got a daughter, have you?”
Mr. Tomlinson gave such a start against the mantelpiece
that it was a mercy he didn't shake off the heads of the
cherubins on the framework of the mirror that was fixed
above it, with the shock.
The shot had been fired.
“Didn't I," he hesitated. " Bless
my
heart! well, really,
it was one of those trifling minutiæ I quite omitted to
mention."
“And where is Little Popsey ?" enquired Tumbleton.
““ Where's what?” asked Tomlinson in return, suddenly
raising his eyes.
" LITTLE POPSEY."
A transient gleam of hope flashed upon the hapless bride-
groom. They as yet knew nothing of the disastrous rock on
which his seven previous matrimonial ventures has been
wrecked. That which was of vital import was the conceal-
ment of his daughter's age.
“ Where is LITTLE POPSEY, eh ?"
Mr. Tomlinson resumed his place at the fireside, and replied
that "that little pet was asleep.".
“Dear little thing !” exclaimed Ada, “ is it weaned ?"
“Oh, yes—it's weaned ! "
“ Any teeth yet?"
« Rather.”
" How many?"
“Eighteen hundred and twenty-four," answered the despe

rate Tomlinson, driven into a mental whirlpool between the
date when Georgina had first shed those articles and her dental
offspring at the present date.
“I've worked her such a dear little cap, she'll look like a
little angel in it," said Ada, holding up approvingly the
mysterious needlework.
Tomlinson stared vacantly at the opposite wall, as the
vision of his innocent Georgina, thus decorated, rose on his
imagination, and he murmured-
“ So she will--a cherub!”
“I shall have her in my arms all day long,” exclaimed Ada.
Her betrothed poked the fire without saying anything, but
he thought that if that elevating proposition were carried out
to the letter, the arms of his affianced might ache considerably
before night. An hour afterwards witnessed Mr. Tumbleton
and his daughter, in a “ Hansom "cab, driving off to consult
the lights of medical science on the subject of his mysterious
Mr. Tomlinson's time was precious. What was to de done?
His destiny must be decided, and speedily. He paced up
and down his apartment with his hands in the pockets of
his lavender trousers; then he looked out at the window, up
at the clouds-nobody was there who could suggest anything;
then he gazed into the street and excited the hopes of eighteen
cabmen, who instantly hailed him and proceeded to drag
eighteen horses; with their respective vehicles attached, to
the curbstone. Then he finally took up his old position on
the hearthrug, and gazed enquiringly at the coals.
They'll want to see the BABY,” he muttered; “Little
Popsey ! and when I pop into their arms a tender suckling
in its forty-eighth year. Crack! Good-bye to my marriage
again! That'll make the eighth !"
Who would take this unsaleable piece of goods off his hands
even for a month? If he could but marry her to a coasting
captain who came back once in five years, or to somebody who
would take her to the Antipodes.
“No! no! no!" said Tomlinson, crossing his room, and
flattening his nose against the window-pane; “I must drag
my 'tin kettle about with me for life."
Again he interrogated the clouds, and again he stimulated
the cabmen with hopes, and again he experienced the in-
capacity of each to help him in his case; again he was sinking
into a hopeless and agitated reverie when he was roused by a
something falling on to his balcony.

It was a tobacco pipe.
Now, if there is one thing more than another calculated to
irritate the nerves of an independent gentleman of an excitable
temperament, it is the being brought suddenly into conscious-
ness that any projection of his house is being made a receptacle
for the superfluities of his neighbours. Mr. Tomlinson rapidly
opened his window, stepped on to the aforesaid balcony, and
casting his eyes towards the upper story of the adjacent house
encountered a very Red smoking-cap, rather Red face, em-
bellished
with unmistakably Red whiskers and moustache. The
body of the owner of these appendages was then extended more
than half-way out of his window in search of his shattered pipe.
" I say, Sir !" shouted Tomlinson, looking upwards.
“Well, Sir !" shouted his neighbour, glancing downwards.
“ Don't throw your pipes on my balcony !”
“ What business has your balcony under my pipes?”
Ten minutes afterwards, and Tomlinson was again upon the
balcony. Three more pipes, with sundry fragmentary evi-
dences of cigars, had garnished that protuberance; but its
proprietor was calm-deathly calm.
“Sir," said Tomlinson, “I believe I may say Captain ? "
6. What's the difficulty now?”
“None whatever, Sir; may I say Captain?”
I
“Crump."
6. Then, I'll say Crump."
“No, Captain Crump.'
“ Exactly. Will you do me the honour of stepping into my
house for five minutes ?”
The Captain acquiesced; he would light a cigar, and wait
upon Mr. Tomlinson in an instant.
“Here's a chance!” thought Tomlinson, as he heard
Georgina's voice in the hall. “Here's an officer always on
the move, quartered in every part of the globe !"
If he could but induce the Captain to take his daughter and
her fortune, he felt he could brave the effects that the know-
ledge of the trick of passing her off as “Little Popsey” would

“My dear Sir," said Tomlinson, advancing to meet the
captain with extended hand, “I am most happy to see you
and your cigar. Take a seat, pray."
Captain, you 'll excuse me asking you a question. Are
you a married man?"
The Captain opened his eyes, and blew such a volume of
smoke through his nostrils, that it was full five seconds before
Tomlinson recovered sufficiently to resume the subject.

“Is your regiment quartered in town for long?"
“In ten days we're off to Canada.”
Tomlinson's agitation increased : he immediately rang the
bell, and ordered luncheon and pale ale. The Captain declined
the latter beverage: “He had been on the sick list lately, and
was obliged to diet himself on brandy and water.”
“Take a glass now," said Tomlinson, producing a decanter.
" Hot or cold-with or without?"
“Stop a minute," said the Captain, throwing himself back
in the easy chair. “ What does this mean-what's the
programme?"
“I like your face," said Tomlinson, eyeing him with the air
of a connoisseur.
“And I, your manners,-if the brandy's good.”
“It is; and if not, I've something for you to take after it.”
“ What's that? something stronger?”
" Much. A WIFE!!!”
Captain Crump paused, closed his left eye, and laid his right
finger to the right side of his nose.
“I prefer the brandy!”
Charming person,” urged Tomlinson.
“ Pooh!”
The Captain rose.
“Draws! Sings! Plays!" said Tomlinson, in a louder voice.
6. Stuff !”
“Three hundred a year !!” shouted Tomlinson.
The Captain stopped suddenly, sat down in the nearest
chair, and stared hard.
“ You 're joking !”
“I'm serious.”
“Marry three hundred a-year!”
“Easily!”
Whilst Tomlinson sought Georgina, Captain Crump con-
gratulated himself on having popped upon two good things
besides his pay—those articles were a neighbour with strong
brandy, and a wife with three hundred a-year.
His impatience was becoming uncontrollable when the door
opened and Papa and Child entered.
“My dear friend,” faltered Tomlinson, with an inward
misgiving that his dear friend would call him out directly he
looked in a certain direction. “ Allow me to introduce my
daughter, Georgina."
“ Innocent and beautiful young creature !" commenced the
Captain. He turned, stopped, opened his eyes, slowly removed
his cigar from between his lips, drew himself up so high that

“What!” he gasped, “WHY, SHE'S TWICE AS OLD AS YOU ARE.
It's impossible! I CAN'T DO IT!” With an unutterable look
at Georgina, and one never to be erased from the memory of
Tomlinson, the Captain strode out of the room. He paid his
rent; called a cab; and was never heard of in that neighbour-
hood again."
“A thunderbolt in petticoats !” exclaimed the miserable
Tomlinson, looking fiercely in the direction of his child's
apartment. “ After all, what is she to me?

shouldn't have objected to her as mother-in-law, but as a
daughter, she's preposterous. Ridiculous !”
As he said this he gave an indignant kick at a pair of
corpulent slippers that had been left on the hearthrug. He
paused. The slippers belonged to Tumbleton.
“ What an idea!” he involuntarily exclaimed. Why
shouldn't she be my mother? It's the only way she can

Ada had encountered Georgina. Tumbleton had met
Tomlinson's thunderbolt. All was over. The old gentleman
had mistaken her for Tomlinson's mother; the young lady
was outrageous at the duplicity of her swain. Tumbleton
dived into the dining-room and laughed. Ada bounced into
parlour and pouted; Georgina double-locked herself in her
bedroom and screamed ; and Tomlinson sought each and
every room by turns, anathematizing himself, the world in
general, and Georgina in particular. His rounds had ter-
minated in meeting Tumbleton in the dining-room.
“Done !” exclaimed Tomlinson, sitting down in despair.
“I don't object," answered Tumbleton.
“But your daughter does. Is there nothing that can
induce her to hold, her engagement still?"
“ Only one thing.”

“Of course," responded Tomlinson, “But I confined my

“ Mine's intellectual !" echoed Tumbleton. "Imagine to

Mr. Tomlinson slowly advanced, took Tumbleton's right
hand within one of his own, leisurely turned back the cuff
of the old gentleman's coat with the other, and felt his
patient's pulse.
“Humph !” he muttered, drawing his hand across his chin,
“ Frequent, Intermittent, Inconsistent, Indolent, Eloquent.”
“ Bless me!” exclaimed Tumbleton, starting.
“How old are you?” enquired Tomlinson.
“Fifty-four last birthday,"answered the trembling Tumbleton,
“I thought so. Had the measles ?”
Tumbleton nodded.
“I thought so. Mumps ?"
Tumbleton shook his head.
“I thought not."
Tomlinson planted his hands firmly on his hips as he
surveyed his victim, and replied, “The case is clear; your
attack is a chronical complication of epidemical sensations,
acting through the nervous membranes, associated with the
diaphonous cuticle, covering the inner metamsychosis of your
periosteum.”
“That's IT!” cried Tumbleton, jumping up, “ that's where
my complaint lies! It's MY PERIOSTEUM!"
“Where is it situated ?” he asked.
“ Everywhere," answered the young practitioner.
“ Is there a remedy?”
“Out of nine patients I lost eight."
“ But the ninth ?"
" Cured.”
“How?”
“ You'd never submit."
“I would I will. What did you do to number nine?"
" I MARRIED HIM.”
A cold perspiration diffused itself over 'every fibre of
Tumbleton's body.
“Of course," pursued Tomlinson, “ Cause of complaint—the
Nerves! The nerves disarranged can only be reduced to
order--calmed and soothed by a soft and winning wife.",

the recesses of his travelling bag, from which he extracted a
Bradshaw.
“ What are you doing?”
“Going to see when the next train starts for Torquay.”
“Why there ?"
“ I don't know any one who's got that medicine here."
“What !” cried Tomlinson, forcing Mr. Tumbleton into a
chair so rapidly, that that gentleman's fat legs flashed into the
air as if they had been blown up by gunpowder. “ Ungrateful
man! can you have beheld, unmoved, the agitation of a
young, fresh heart, palpitating within a yard of your in-
sensible bosom?”
“ Who? Which? Where?” enquired the bewildered Tumble-
ton.
What answer Tomlinson made is not recorded. Suffice it
to say, that on a bright May morning, exactly a month from
that date, Mr. Thomas Tumbleton was married to Miss
Georgina ; and Mr. Tomlinson wa
engaged in a similar
ceremony with Miss Ada. It was a touching sight. In the
presence of the officiating clergyman and clerk, Mr. Tomlinson
solemnly blessed his children, the late Miss Georgina and
Mr. Thomas Tumbleton; and Mr. Thomas Tumbleton blessed
his children, Mr. Herbert Tomlinson and the late Miss Ada
Tumbleton. From subsequent correspondence of a year's later
date we learn that the nerves of Mr. and Mrs. Tumbleton
received a terrible shock by the announcement that a son and
heir had been bequeathed to the house of Tomlinson; that
Mr. Tumbleton has since suffered severely from an attack of
mental exhaustion, consequent on endeavouring to decide what
relation the new-comer bears towards him. Being conscious
that he, Tumbleton, being now Tomlinson's father, has also
become by marriage Tomlinson's son, it occurs to him now
that his, Tumbleton's daughter has now become his mother;
so the question is whether the infant Tomlinson, born to
his daughter, is in point of law his grandchild or his brother !
All his enquiries, made through periodicals on this subject,
have been replied to with “ DECLINED WITH THANKS."—Walter

I married late, but I would wish to see
My grandchild on my knees before I die:
And I have set my heart upon à match.
Now therefore look to Dora; she is well
To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
She is my brother's daughter: he and I
Had once hard words, and parted, and he died
In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
His daughter Dora : take her for your wife;
For I have wished this marriage, night and day,
For many years.
But William answered short;
“I cannot marry Dora; by my life,
I will not marry Dora.” Then the old man
Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:
“ You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!
But in my time a father's word was law,
And so it shall be now for me.
Look to it;
Consider, William : take a month to think,
And let me have an answer to my wish;
Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,
And never more darken my doors again.”
But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,
And broke away. The more he look'd at her
The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
The month was out he left his father's house,
And hired himself to work within the fields;
And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed
A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison.
Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd
His niece and said: “My girl, I love you well;
But if you speak with him that was my son,
Or change a word with her he calls his wife,
My home is none of yours. My will is law."
And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,
“It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change !"

And days went on, and there was born a boy
To William; then distresses came on him;
And day by day he passed his father's gate,
Heart-broken, and his father helped him not.
But Dora stored what little she could save,
And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know
Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
On William; and in the harvest time he died.
Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought
Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:
“I have obeyed my uncle until now,
And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me
This evil came on William at the first.
But, Mary, for the sake of him that's
gone,
And for your sake, the woman that he chose,
And for this orphan, I am come to you:
You know there has not been for these five years
So full a harvest: let me take the boy,
And I will set him in my uncle's eye
Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,
And bless him for the sake of him that's gone.”
And Dora took the child, and went her way
Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound
That was unsown, where many poppies grew.
Far off the farmer came into the field
And spied her not; for none of all his men
Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
And Dora would have risen and gone to him,
But her heart failed her; and the reapers reap'd,
And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
But when the morrow came, she rose and took
The child once more, and sat upon the mound;
And made a little wreath of all the flowers
That grew about, and tied it round his bat
To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.
Then when the farmer pass'd into the field
He spied her, and he left his men at work,
And came and said; “Where were you yesterday?
Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"
So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,
And answer'd softly, “ This is William's child!"
“ And did I not,” said Allan, “ did I not
Forbid
Dora?" Dora said again:

betwixt you
“Do with me as you will, but take the child
And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"
And Allan said, “I see it is a trick
Got
up
and the woman there.
I must be taught my duty, and by you !
You knew my word was law, and yet you dared
To slight it. Well--for I will take the boy;
But go you hence, and never see me more.'
So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud
And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,
And the boy's cry came to her from the field,
More and more distant.
Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood
Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
To God, that helped her in her widowhood.
And Dora said, “ My uncle took the boy;
But, Mary, let me live and work with you:
He
says
that he will never see me more."
Then answer'd' Mary, “ This shall never be
That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:
And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,
For he will teach him hardness, and to slight
His mother; therefore thou and I will go,
And I will have my boy, and bring him home;
And I will beg of him to take thee back:
But if he will not take thee back again,
Then thou and I will live within one house,
And work for William's child, until he grows
Of age to help us.”
?
:
So the women kiss'd
Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.
The door was off the latch: they peep'd, and saw
The boy sat up betwixt his grandsire's knees,
Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,
And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,
Like one that lov'd him:
Then they came in : but when the boy beheld
His mother, he cried out to come to her:
And Allan sat him down, and Mary said:
“O father!-if you let we call you som
I never came a-begging for myself,
Or William, or this child; but now I come

For Dora: take her back; she loves you well
Oh sir, when William died, he died at peace
With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said
He could not ever rue his marrying me-
I had been a patient wife: but, sir, he said
That he was wrong to cross his father thus :
•God bless him!' he said, "and may he never know
The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turn'd
His face and pass'd—unhappy that I am!
But now, sir, let me have my boy, for you
Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight
His father's memory; and take Dora back,
And let all this be as it was before."
So Mary said, and Dora hid her face
By Mary. There was silence in the room;
And all at once the old man burst in sobs:-
“I have been to blame-to blame. I have killed my
"
son.
I have kill'd him—but I loved him-my dear son.
May God forgive me!-I have been to blame.
Kiss me my children.”
Then they clung about
The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times.
And all the man was broken with remorse;
And all his love came back a hundredfold;
And for three hours he sobb’d o'er William's child,
Thinking of William.
So those four abode
Within one house together; and as years
Went forward, Mary took another mate;
But Dora lived unmarried till her death.-Tennyson.

grave in the attempt.
Enter DOMINIE SAMPSON, looking at his clothes.
Dom. Truly, my outward man doth somewhat embarrass
my sensations of identity. My vestments are renovated

Meg. Stop !—I command thee!

Mey. No, I am not mad !I've been imprisoned for mad-

her! I am perturbed at thy words_Woman, I conjure thee!
Nay, then, will I flee incontinently!
Meg. Halt! stand fast, or ye shall rue the day, while a limb

Dom. Conjuro te, nequissima, et scelestissima!
Meg. What gibberish is that? Go from me to Colonel Man-

Dom. I am fugacious.

Meg. Drink ! and put some heart in you.
Dom. Lo; I obey!

Meg. Can your learning tell what this is?
Dom. Praised be thy bounty-wine.
Meg. Will

Dom. I will, most pernicious—that is, pertinacious-
Meg. Then tell Colonel Mannering, if ever he owed a debt
to the House of Ellangowan, and hopes to see it prosper, he

below the Tower of Derncleugh, and fail not on his life ! you
know the spot?
Dom. I do-where you once dwelt, most accursed--that is,
most accurate.
Meg. Ay, Abel Sampson, there blazed my hearth for many
a day! and there, beneath the willow, that hung its garlands
over the brook, I've sat, and sung to Harry Bertram, songs of
the olden time. That tree is withered now, never to be green
again; and old Meg Merrilies will never sing blythe songs
But I charge you, Abel Sampson, when the heir shall
have his own-as soon he shall-

Dom. Woman !-what sayest thou ?
Meg. That you tell him not to forget Meg Merrilies, but
to build the old walls in the glen, for her sake, and let
those that live there be too good to fear the beings of another
world; for, if ever the dead come back among the living, I'll
be seen in that glen many a night after these crazed bones are
whitened in the mouldering grave. I have said it, old man!
you shall see him again, and the best lord he shall be that
Ellangowan has seen this hundred years. The moment is
at hand, when all shall behold
Bertram's right, and Bertram's might,
Meet on Ellangowan's height.

THE DAY IS DONE.
The day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of Night,
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.
I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
That my soul cannot resist:
A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.
Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of day.
Not from the grand old masters,
Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of Time.
For, like strains of martial music,
Their mighty thoughts suggest

Read from some humbler poet,

As showers from the clouds of summer,

Who, through long days of labour,
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.

And the cares that infest the day,

And as silently steal away.-Long fellow.

Never, so much as in a thought unborn,
Did I offend your highness.
Duke F. Thus do all traitors :
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace
itself.
Let it suffice thee, that I trust thee not.
Ros. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Duke F. Thou art thy father's daughter, there's enough.
Ros. So was I, when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I, when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much,
To think my poverty is treacherous.
Cel. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
Duke F. Ay, Celia, we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.
Cel. I did not then entreat to have her stay,
It was your pleasure and your own remorse;
I was too young that time to value her,
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why, so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled, and inseparable.
Duke F. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Her very silence and her patience,
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool: She robs thee of thy name:
And thou wilt shew more bright, and seem more virtuous,
When she is gone: then open not thy lips;
Firm and irrevocable is
my
doom
Which I have pass'd upon her: she is banish'd.
Cel. Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege;
I cannot live out of her company.
Duke F. You are a fool. - You, niece, provide yourself;
If you out-stay the time, upon mine honour,
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
Cel. O my poor Rosalind ! whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers ? I will give thee mine.

Shall we be sunder'd ? shall we part, sweet girl ?

my
father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me, how we may fly,
Whither to go, and what to bear with us :
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
Ros. Why, whither shall we go ?
Cel. To seek my uncle.
Ros. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
Cel. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
And with a kind of umber'smirch
my
face;
The like do you; so shall we pass along,
And never stir assailants.
Ros. Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man ?
A boar-spear in my hand; and (in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will)
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside ;
As
many
other mannish cowards have,
That do outface it with their semblances.
Cel. What shall I call thee, when thou art a man ?
Ros. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
And therefore look you call me, Ganymede.
But what will
you
be called ?
Cel. Something that hath a reference to my state;
No longer Celia, but Aliena.
Ros. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
Cel. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him: Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together;
Devise the fittest time, and safest way
To hide us from pursuit, that will be made
After my flight: Now go we in content
To liberty, and not to banishment. --Shakespeare.

GOODY GRIM VERSUS LAPSTONE.
MATTHEWS (" AT HOME.")
This trial happened in a certain town, which, for reasons,
shall be nameless, and is as follows:-Goody Grim inhabited
an almshouse, No. 2; Will Lapstone, a superannuated
cobbler, lived in No. 3; and a certain Jew Pedlar, who hap-
pened to pass through the town where those almshouses
were situated, could only think of number One. Goody
Grim was in the act of killing one of her own proper pigs; but
the animal, disliking the ceremony, burst from her hold—ran
through the semi-circular legs of the aforesaid Jew,-knocked
him in the mud,—ran back to Will Lapstone's the cobbler,
upset a quart bottle full of gin belonging to the said Lapstone,
and took refuge in the cobbler's state bed.
The parties, being, of course, in the most opulent circum-
stances, consulted counsel learned in the law. The result
was, that Goody Grim was determined to ing an action
against Lapstone “ for the loss of her pig with a curly tail ;"
and Lapstone to bring an action against Goody Grim for the
loss of a quart bottle full of Hollands gin; and Mordecai to
bring an action against them both for “de losh of a tee-totum
dat fell out of his pocket in the rencounter.” They all
delivered their briefs to counsel, before was considered they
were all parties and no witnesses. But Goody Grim, like a
wise old lady as she was, now changed her battery, deter-
mined to bring an action against Lapstone, and bind over
Mordecai as an evidence.
The indictment set forth, “That he, Lapstone, not having
the fear of the Assizes before his eyes, but being moved by
pig, and instigated by pruinsence, did, on the first day of
April, a day sacred in the annals of law, steal, pocket, hide,
and crib, divers, that is to say, five hundred hogs, sows,
boars, pigs, and porkers with curly tails; and did secrete the
said five hundred hogs, sows, boars, pigs, and porkers with
curly tails, in the said Lapstone's bed, against the peace of
our Lady the Queen, her crown, and dignity.”
Mordecai was examined by counsellor Puzzle.
“ Well, sir, what are you?”
“I sells old clo', and sealing-vax, and puckles.”
“I did not ask you what you sold; I ask you what you
are?”
“ I am about five and forty.”
“I did not ask your age; I ask you what you are ?"

totum is derived from the Latin terms of te and tutum, which
mean 'keep yourself safe. And this man, but for my sagacity,
observation, and so forth, would have kept himself safe; but
now he has, as the learned Lord Verulam expresses it, 'let
the cat out of the bag.'
“I vill take my oash I had no cat in ma bag."
My lord, by his own confession he was about to vend a
tee-totum.”
“My lord, one of the witnesses has owned that the pig had
a curly tail. Now, my lord, I presume if I prove the pig had
,
a straight tail, I consider the objection must be fatal.”
“Certainly; order the pig into court.”
Here the pig was produced; and, upon examination, it was
found to have a straight tail, which finished the trial. The
learned Judge, in summing up the evidence, addressed the
jury:-
:-“Gentlemen of the jury, it is wholly unnecessary to
recapitulate the evidence; for the removal of this objection
removes all ground of action. And, notwithstanding the
ancient statute, which says, Serium pigum, et boreum pigum,
et vendi curlum tailum,' there is an irrefragable proof, by
ocular demonstration, that Goody Grim's grunter had a
straight tail, and, therefore, the prisoner must be acquitted.”
- This affair is thrown into Chancery, and it is expected it
will be settled about the end of the year 1970.-Smith.

Kath. Sir, it is in mercy to mankind I make it. What
would be a fond husband's sufferings, were he to see the wife
of his bosom sinking under the degrading consciousness that
she was unworthy of him?
Chas. Unworthy!
Kath. Would he not cast her from him? Yes, yes he would
do so I must live on, unloved.
Chas. [A side.] She is irresistible !—Madam, I offer to you
my hand and heart. [kneels.]
Kath. I must retire. My maid shall return, and speak a
few words to you; and then, after you have seen your uncle,
you may visit me again. [Kath. is wheeled out.]

Chas. Well, positively, that is the laziest proceeding I ever
witnessed. I suppose she was too faint to move. Well, Susan,
how is your mistress? She is a charming creature.
What a
happy girl you are—what a sweet mistress you have got !
Sus. She is charming-poor thing!
Chas. Poor thing?—what do you mean by poor thing?
Sus. Oh, it's very sad !
Chas. What is sad?
Sus. You saw my mistress whisper me?
Chas. Yes, to be sure! but there's nothing so sad in a
whisper.
Sus. Indeed, but there is, though! She desired me to
reveal the affair to you: she had not courage to tell you
herself. To be sure, you must have known it, sooner or later.
Chas. What can you mean?—You frighten me out of my
wits?
Sus. It's a sad affliction for her!-a very great defect !
she's much to be pitied.
Chas. A defect? another defect? and I have committed my-
self!—I've proposed ! what is it?—
Sus. Oh, sir!
Chas. Speak out, do!
Sus.. Many years ago
Chas. That's as bad as once upon a time.” Pray go on l
make haste.
Sus. My mistress was thrown from her horse-
Chas. Yes—well-she was not killed; so, what then?
Sus. Fractured limb-
Chas. Oh! What limb ?
Sus. Foot-broke it-all to bits-and-
Chas. Well speak!
Sus. Amputation !
Chas. Horror!-What?
Sus. She has got a cork foot !
Chas. A cork foot! Horror! What have I done! engaged
myself to a—a cork foot. What am I about to do? renounce
her! see her no more because she is unfortunate-no, no. I'm
no such cold-hearted coward! Oh, here she is. [Kate is

Chas. No, you wrong me!

ANNABEL LEE.
It was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the Sea,
that a Maiden there lived, whom you may know by the name of
Annabel Lee; and this Maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love, and be loved by me? I was a child, and she
was a child, in this kingdom by the Sea ; but we loved with a
love that was more than love,-I and my Annabel Lee; with
e
a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven coveted her and

me! And this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom
by the Sea, a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling my beautiful
Annabel Lee; so that her high-born kinsmen came, and
bore her away from me, to shut her up in a sepulchre—in this
kingdon by the Sea. The Angels, not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me; yes! that was the reason (as all
men know, in this kingdom by the Sea) that the Wind came
out of the cloud by night, chilling and killing my Annabel
Lee. But our love it was stronger by far than the love of
those who were older than we--of many far wiser than we;
and neither the Angels in heaven above,-nor the Demons
down under the sea,- -can ever dissever my soul, from the soul
of the beautiful Annabel Lee! For the moon never beams
without bringing me dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
and the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes of the
beautiful Annabel Lee; and so, all the night tide, I lie down
by the side of my darling-my darling-my life and my bride;
in her pulchre there by the Sea,—in her tomb by the
sounding Sea !—Poe.
ADVICE TO PLAYERS.
SPEAK the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of
our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand—thus; but
use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may
say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me
to the soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the
groundlings: who, for the most part, are capable of nothing
but inexplicable dumb show and noise: I would have such a
fellow whipped, for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods
Herod: pray you, avoid it.—Be not too tame neither, but let
your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the
word, the word to the action; with this special observance,
that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so
overdone is from the purpose of playing; whose end both at
the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror
up to nature; to shew virtue, her own feature, scorn her own
image, and the very age and body of the time, his form and
pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it

make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of which one must, in your allowance,
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. Oh! there be players
that I have seen play,—and heard others praise, and that
highly-not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the
accent of Christian, nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, or man,
have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of
Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.-Shakespeare.

BLANCHE OF DEVAN.-PART I.
All in the Trossachs' glen was still,
Noontide was sleeping on the hill :
Sudden his guide whoop'd loud and high-
“Murdoch! was that a signal cry?”-
He stammer'd forth—“I shout to scare
Yon raven from his dainty fare."
He look'd—he knew the raven's prey,
His own brave steed :"Ah! gallant grey!
For thee—for me, perchance—'twere well
We ne'er had seen the Trossachs' dell-
Murdoch, move first-but silently;
Whistle or whoop, and thou shalt die!"
Jealous and sullen, on they fared,
Each silent, each upon his guard.
Now wound the path its dizzy ledge
Around a precipice's edge,
When lo ! a wasted female form,
Blighted by wrath of sun and storm,
In tatter'd weeds and wild array,
Stood on a cliff beside the way,
And glancing round her restless eye,
Upon the wood, the rock, the sky,
Seem'd nought to mark, yet all to spy.
Her brow was wreath'd with gaudy broom,
With gesture wild she waved a plume
Of feathers, which the eagles fling
To crag and cliff from dusky wing;
Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
Where scarce was footing for the goat.
The tartan plaid she first descried,
And shriek'd till all the rocks replied ;

As loud she laugh'd when near they drew,
For then the Lowland garb she knew;
And then her hands she wildly wrung,
And then she wept, and then she sung-
She sung !—the voice, in better time,
Perchance to harp or lute might chime;
And now, though strain’d and roughen'd, still
Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.
“ They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,
They say my brain is warp'd and rung-
I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
I cannot pray in Highland tongue.
But were I now wbere Allan glides,
Or heard my native Devan'setides,
So sweetly would I rest, and pray
That Heaven would close my wintry day!"

She hovers o'er the hollow way,
And flutters wide her mantle

As the lone heron spreads his wing,
By twilight, o'er a haunted spring."

“A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
When Roderick foray'd Devan-side;
The gay bridegroom resistance made,
And felt our chief's unconquer'd blade.
I marvel she is now at large,
But oft she 'scapes from Maudlin's charge.-
Hence, brain-sick fool!”—he rais'd his bow :-
“Now, if thou strikest her but one blow,
I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
As ever peasant pitch'd a bar !"-
“ Thanks, champion, thanks! these I prepare,
To seek my true love through the air !
I will not lend that savage groom,
To break his fall, one downy plume!
No deep amid disjointed stones,
The wolves shall batten on his bones,
And then shall his detested plaid,
By bush and briar in mid-air staid,
Wave forth a banner fair and free,
Meet signal for their revelry."-

Characters. — MAJOR DICEBOROUGH, MACKINTOSH SMYTHE,
MR. MURRAY, and SERVANT.
Enter DICEBOROUGH and SERVANT.
Major. No one of the name of Murray called, you say?
Serv. No, sir.
Major. Past twelve o'clock! Strange! I'm surprised that
he hasn't sent, if he's prevented from coming. Let me see
Mr. Smythe the instant he arrives; and-d’ye hear ? should
Mr. Murray call, you can say you're not sure if I'm in, for
I've been called out every five minutes since ten o'clock; but
you 'll see. Go! [Exit Servant.] That will sound well-
give him a higher opinion of the whole affair, and perhaps
induce him to risk a few more thousands in the scheme. So
the train is laid, I hold the match in my hand ; let me get
but this money, and the explosion may take place when and
where it will. Let me calculate my chances. Mr. Williams
(Murray's father-in-law) has already taken twenty £50 shares
in my company, having full faith in our wonderful scheme,
and never doubting the names of the management, of which,
under twelve aliases, I happen to have constituted myself
Chairman, Secretary, and Board of Directors. Mr. Murray's
sister-in-law is in my power; her reputation lies in this
very bundle of letters, all confessing, in her own handwriting,
the wrong done to her sister seventeen years ago. Under a
threat of exposure I have induced her to promise that Murray
shall invest almost all his capital in our new company; and

at the door.] Who's there? Come in.
Enter MR. MACKINTOSH SMYTHE, with newspaper in one hand
and his hat in the other.
Smythe. Read that, and see if that dosen't take the grin out
of ye.
Major. Electrics at two-and-a-half discount! Why, they
were at two-and-a-half premium only yesterday.
Smythe. The game's up, and the birds had better be flying;
the balance at the banker's not worth a rap, and the best
advice I can give is, that we both try a change of air for a
year or two at the antipodes.
Major [Points to a large black note-case that lay upon the
table]. Before the day is out, my boy, I'll have that filled!
Smythe. From old Williams?
Major. No; from his son-in-law, Mr. James Murray!
Smythe. He's a Yorkshireman: and those from the north
are keener than many suppose them; but [closing the door, and
speaking in a lower tone) good luck to ye, my boy! and may
ye never die till the evil one's tired of ye living!

Enter MR. MURRAY.
Major. Glad to see you, my dear fellow; take a seat, pray.
Murray. Thank you.
Major. Some idea of taking shares, I presume? Just so.
You've not done much in that sort of thing, evidently, or
you'd know at once that shares in a company like ours can't
be had for the mere asking—there's a perfect rush for them
at present.
Murray. Indeed; you surprise me.
Major. I daresay I do; you don't know half the worth of
the
company,
I can assure you.
Murray. I daresay not.
Major. In ten minutes I'll put you in possession of certain
facts to be realized, and the profits to be amassed, by
connecting one's-self with the Society that will form our
present subject of discourse. [They seat themselves.] Of all
enterprizes which appeal to the world in general, and to the
mercantile world in particular, none has ever excited a
greater consternation in the business firmament than that

of our Patent-Electric-Inexplosible-Easy-Transit Company.
The reason is obvious-steam is at length superseded, safety
insured; with an equal amount of profit to director, share-
holder, and passenger. Its claims must be felt by communities
in England, Ireland, Europe, America, and, in point of fact,
we may almost include Australia, and the world at large. The
enterprize must arouse the sympathies of the rich and poor;
and you, Mr. Murray, as a Christian, as a man of intellect
and of refinement, must at once give it a cordial welcome, as
being one of the means of a rapid development of civilization
and of
peace. Do we rejoice in a new discovery? Not only
can the fact be made known, but the talented discoverer be at
once conveyed to regions hitherto inaccessible under a long
and perilous journey.
It is no idle chimera. The names of
the directors, although unknown to London, are a tower of
strength on the Continent. The date of the running of the
first train is actually fixed: and when the start takes place,
who can say where it will stop. The profits will, of course,
depend upon the scale of charges, which are rated at a fifth
Less than those at present charged by even the most economic
railway company. Looking into the future, as, of course, men
of business we are bound to do, we at once perceive the total
annihilation of all traffic by steam, and an enormous profit to
the shareholders (that will be added as a bonus) from the
amount to be realized from the sale of iron that will be thereby
rendered useless. And now, my very dear sir, in order both
for your interest and my own, I'll at once enrol your name
for-let me see five hundred shares, did you say?:
Murray. Not exactly!
Major. Five hundred--that wasthe number your sister named?
Murray. My sister. Yes--perhaps so.
Major. I suppose what is said by her is the same as if said
by you?
Murray. Not exactly.
Major. Well, let's lose no more time! how many do you
want ?
Murray. None at all.
Major. What d'ye mean?
Murray. What I say.
Major. Then, may I inquire what business you have with
me this morning?
Murray. Certainly.
Major. What is it?
Murray. I came to give you something, and to take away
another something in exchange.

Major. I'm no hand at riddles! Speak plainly!
Murray. I will. What I have to give you is the twenty
shares you
induced
my
father-in-law to take. What you must
give me are the letters addressed to you by my sister; to a
plain question I return an equally plain answer.
Major. Give back the money! My dear Mr. Murray, if
you have nothing better to do than to bring your nonsensical
demands to my office, in the name of common sense, pray keep
away. The Stock Exchange is the mart for buying, my trade
is that of selling shares. For your fool's errand concerning
the letters-how you got your information, I neither know
nor care to inquire. Take no for my answer; and make your-
self scarce.
Murray. I expected your answer; but I think you 'll change
your mind.
Major. Oh, you do, do you! Well, let's hear your pro-
position. I like novelty, and your plan will at least amuse,
if it does nothing else. I shall take the liberty of smoking, if
you've no objection, and all I beg of you is to make your
story short. [Major Diceborough lights. his cigar, lounges com-
fortably back in his easy chair.] Now I'm at your service.
Proceed.
Murray. I don't know whether you are aware of what
position I once held in London. Five years ago I was a city
merchant:-one of the firm of Mathieson & Co. I was the Co.
Amongst the many bill transactions of our house, one was
presented at our office from a firm in Spain, which was
accordingly paid. Upon advising our correspondents of the
fact, they at once replied that the party who had presented
the bill, was doubtless a clerk whom they had despatched
to London with Bills, of whom nothing had since been
heard.—May I be permitted to join you in a cigar? His
photograph was enclosed; and we were requested to take
measures for his arrest. Nothing, however, was heard of him,
and the transaction was overlooked. In the course of two
years the firm was dissolved : Mr. Mathieson died, and I
retired.—Would you oblige me with a light? I've forgot my
matches.-_THE PHOTOGRAPH REMAINED IN MY POSSESSION. At
the time the money was paid, there was apparently no person
present but an old clerk (now deceased); but the junior
partner sat in an inner room,—I'm hardly lighted yet,—and
through the glazed door which separated it from the office, he
distinctly saw the features of the man who presented the bill;
they corresponded as exactly with the photograph, AS THOSE OF
THE PHOTOGRAPH NOW DO WITII YOURS. [Diceborough sinks back

book; and shall part with them only upon one condition.
Major. How dare you insinuate?' Leave my house this
instant!
Murray. I'm not going to take it with me; I'm too good å
judge of what it contains.
Major. Will you compel me to force you! (about to strike
him?
Murray. [Putting him into his seat.] No; quite the opposite.
You have compelled me, you see, to force you. I must finish
my story: you'd better hear it quietly.
Major. Go on.
Murray. Are you listening? Well, then, both the bill and the
photograph are nere, and I shall part with them but on
certain terms.
Major. Out with them. What are they?
Murray. That you return the money of which you have
defrauded
my
father-in-law, and restore the letters extorted
from my self-accused sister.
Major. [Unlocks drawer.] There is the money.
Murray. And there is the bill. Now the letters.
Major. There! [Giving them.]
Murray. And there is the photograph.

not for long. Like other public nuisances, you must be

VIRGINIA.
[By kind permission of Messrs. LONGMAN & Co.]
OVER the Alban mountains, the light of morning broke;
From all the roofs of the Seven Hills curled the thin wreaths
of smoke :
The city gates were open; the Forum, all alive
With buyers and with sellers, was humming like a hive:
Blithely on brass and timber the craftsman's stroke was
ringing,
And blithely o'er her panniers the market-girl was singing;
And blithely young Virginia came smiling from her home-
Ah! woe for young Virginia, the sweetest maid in Rome.
With her small tablets in her hand, and her satchel on her
arm,
Forth she went bounding to the school, nor dreamed of shame
or harın.

VIRGINIA,
241
She crossed the Forum, shining with the stalls in alleys gay,
And just had reached the very spot whereon I stand this day,
When
up
the varlet Marcus came; not such as when, erewhile,
He crouched behind his patron's heels, with the true client
smile:
He came with lowering forehead, swollen features, and
clenched fist,
And strode across Virginia's path, and caught her by the
wrist :
Hard strove the frighted maiden, and screamed with look
aghast-
And at her scream from right and left the folk came running
fast;
And the strong smith, Muræna, gave Marcus such a blow,
The caitiff reeled three paces back, and let the maiden go :
Yet glared he fiercely round him, and growled, in harsh fell
tone,
“She's mine, I will have her: I seek but for mine own.
She is my slave, born in my house, and stolen away and sold,
The year of the sore sickness, ere she was twelve hours old.
I wait on Appius Claudius; I waited on his sire:
Let him who works the client wrong beware the patron’s ire!"
-But ere the varlet Marcus again might seize the maid,
Who clung tight to Muræna's skirt, and sobbed, and shrieked
for aid,
Forth through the throng of gazers the young Icilius pressed,
And stamped his foot, and rent his gown, and smote upon
his breast,
And beckoned to the people, and, in bold voice and clear,
Poured thick and fast the burning words which tyrants quake
to hear.

Straightway Virginius led the maid a little space aside,
To where the reeking shambles stood, piled up with horn and
hide;
Hard by, a flesher on a block had laid his whittle down-
Virginius caught the whittle up and laid it in his gown;
And then his eyes grew very dim, and his throat began to
swell,
And in a hoarse, changed voice he spake," Farewell, sweet
child, farewell!
Oh ! how I loved my darling! Though stern I sometimes be,
To thee, thou know'st, I was not so. Who could be so to
thee?

And how my darling loved me! How glad she was to hear
My footstep on the threshold, when I came back last year!
Aud how she danced with pleasure to see my civic crown,
And took my sword, and hung it up, and brought me forth
my gown :
Now, all those things are over-yes, all thy pretty ways-
Thy needlework, thy prattle, thy snatches of old lays;
And none will grieve when I go forth, or smile when I return,
Or watch beside the old man's bed, or weep upon his urn.
--The time is come! See, how he points his eager hand this
way!
See, how his eyes gloat on thy grief, like a kite's upon the
prey.
With all his wit he little deems, that, spurned, betrayed,
bereft,
Thy father hath, in his despair, one fearful refuge left.
He little deems, that in this hand I clutch what still can save
Thy gentle youth from taunts and blows, the portion of the
slave;
Yea, and from nameless evil, that passeth taunt and blow-
Foul outrage, which thou knowest not, which thou shalt
never know?
Then clasp me round the neck once more, and give me one
more kiss;
And now, mine own dear little girl, there is no way-BUT
THIS!”
- With that he lifted high the steel, and smote her in the
side,
And in her blood she sank to earth, and with one sob she
died !-Macaulay.

Well,
Verges. Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can
write and read.
Dogb. Come hither, neighbour . Seacoal : You have been
blessed with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by na-
ture.
Seacoal. Both which, Master Constable-
Dogb. You have : I knew it would be your answer.
for your favour, sir, why, give hearty thanks, and make no
boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear
when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here
to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch : therefore, bear you the lantern. [Gives it.] This is
your charge :
-You shall comprehend all vagrom men; you
are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
Seacoal. How if he will not stand ?
Dogb. Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go ; and
presently call the rest of the watch together, and be thankful
you are rid of a knave.
Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
of the prince's subjects.
Dogb. True; and they are to meddle with none but the
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in the
streets; for, for the watch to babble and talk, is most toler-
able and not to be endured.
Seacoal. We will rather sleep than talk; we know what
belongs to a watch.
Dogb. Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend : only,
have a care that your bills be not stolen :-Well, you are to
call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get
them to bed.
Seacoal. How if they will not?
Dogb. Why, then, let them alone till they are sober : if
they make you not then the better answer, you may say, they
are not the men you took them for.
Seacoal. Well, sir.
Dogb. If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men,
;
the less you męddle or make with them, why, the more is for
your honesty.

down the prince's officer, coXCOMB. Come, bind them. Thou

Dogb. Dost thou not suspect my place ? Dost thou not
suspect my years ? Oh, that he were here, to write me down
an ass !—but masters, remember, that I am an ass : though it
be not written down, yet forget not, that I am an ass :—No,
thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon
thee by good witness! I am a wise fellow; and, which is
more, an officer; and, which is more, a house-holder; and,
which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina; and
one that knows the law, go to; and a rich fellow enough, go
to; and a fellow that hath had losses ; and one that hath two
gowns, and every thing handsome about him.-Bring him
away. Oh, that I had been writ down an ass !
THE THREE WARNINGS.
THE tree of deepest root is found
Least willing still, to quit the ground;
'Twas therefore said by ancient sages,
That love of life increased with years
So much, that in our later stages,
(When pains grow sharp, and sickness rages),
The greatest love of life appears.
This strong affection to believe-
Which all confess, but few perceive,-
If old assertions can't prevail,-
Be pleased to hear a modern tale.
When sports went round, and all were gay
On neighbour Dobson's wedding-day;-
Death call’d aside the jocund groom
With him into another room;
And looking grave,
“ You must,” says he,
“Quit your sweet bride and come with me.
“With you!” and quit my Susan's side!
"With you,” the hapless husband cried,
Young as I am! 'tis monstrous hard:
Besides, in truth, I'm not prepared;
My thoughts on other matters go,
This is my wedding-day, you know.”

What more he urged, I have not heard ;-
His reasons could not well be stronger;
So Death the poor delinquent spared,
And left to live a little longer.
Yet, calling up a serious look,
(His hour-glass trembled while he spoke) -
Neighbour," said he, “ farewell; no more
Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour;
And farther,—to avoid all blame
Of cruelty upon my name,
To give you time for preparation,
And fit
you
for
your
future station,
Three several warnings you shall have
Before you're summoned to the grave:
Willing for once I'll quit my prey,
And grant a kind reprieve;
In hopes you'll have no more to say,
But when I call again this way,
Well pleased the world will leave.”-
To these conditions both consented,
And parted perfectly contented.
What next the hero of our tale befell,
How long he lived, how wisely well;
How roundly he pursued his
course,
And smoked his pipe, and stroked his horse,
The willing muse shall tell :-
He chaffer'd then, he bought, he sold :
Nor once perceived his growing old,
Nor thought of death as near:
His friends not false, his wife no shrew,
Many his gains, his children few;
He pass'd his smiling hours in peace,
And still he view'd his wealth increase.
While thus, along life's dusty road,
The beaten track content he trod,
Old Time (whose haste no mortal spares)
Uncall'd, unheeded, unawares,
Brought on his eightieth year:-
When, lo! one night, in musing mood,
As all alone he sat,
The unwelcome messenger of fate
Once more before him stood.
Half kill'd with anger and surprise,
“ So soon return'd!" old Dobson cries
:

“So soon, do you call it?" Death replies,
“Surely, my friend, you're but in jest:
Since I was here before,
'Tis six and thirty years at least,
And you are now fourscore.”
“So much the worse,” the clown rejoin'd;
“ To spare the aged would be kind: -
Besides, you promised me Three warnings
Which I have look'd for nights and mornings,
And for that loss of time and ease,
I can recover damages.”

“I know," says Death, “ that, at the best,
I seldom am a welcome guest;
But don't be captious, friend, at least;
I little thought you'd still be able
To stump about your
farm and stable;
Your years have run to a great length,
I wish you joy though of your strength. ”
Hold,” says the farmer, “not so fast;
I have been lame these four years past.”
" And no great wonder,” Death replies,
However, you still keep your eyes;
And sure, to see one's loves and friends,
For legs and arms may make amends.
" Perhap," says Dobson," so it might,
But latterly I've lost my sight."

* This is a shocking tale, in truth;
But there's some comfort still,” says Death:
“ Each strives your sadness to amuse-
I warrant, you hear all the news.”
“ There's none,” he cries; “and if their were,
I'm grown so deaf, I could not hear.”
“ Nay, then,” the spectre stern rejoin'd,
“ These are unjustifiable yearnings;
If you are LAME, and DEAF, and BLIND,
You have your three sufficient warnings;
So come along, no more we'll part.”
He said, and touch'd him with his dart;
And now old Dobson, turning pale,
Yields to his fate.-So ends my tale.—Anonymous.

A DISABLED SOLDIER.
“ WHEN my time had expired, I worked my passage home;
and glad was I to see Old England again, because I loved my
country. I was afraid, however, that I should be indicted for
a vagabond once more; so did not much care to go down into
the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs when
I could get them.
“I was very happy in this manner for some time, till one
evening coming home from work, two men knocked me down,
and then desired me to stand. They belonged to a press-
gang. I was carried before the justice; and, as I could give
no account of myself, I had my choice left, whether to go on
board a man-of-war, or list for a soldier. I chose the latter;
and, in this post of a gentleman, I served two campaigns in
Flanders, was at the battles of Val and Fontenoy, and received
but one wound, through the breast here; but the doctor of our
regiment soon made me well again.
“When the peace came on, I was discharged; and, as I
could not work, because my wound was sometimes trouble-
some, I listed for a landsman in the East India Company's
servịce. I here fought the French in six pitched battles ;
and I verily believe that, if I could read or write, our captain
would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good
fortune to have any promotion; for I soon fell sick, and so
got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my
pocket. This was at the beginning of the present war; and
I hoped to be set on shore, and to have the pleasure of spend-
ing my money. But the Government wanted men, and so I
was pressed for a sailor before ever I could set foot on shore.
“The boatswain found me, as he said, an obstinate fellow.
He swore he knew that I understood my business well, but
that I wanted to be idle. But I knew nothing of sea-busi-
ness; and he beat me without considering what he was about.
I had, still, however, my forty pounds, and that was some
comfort to me under every beating; and the money I might
I
have had to this day, but that our ship was taken by the
French, and so I lost all.
“ Our crew was carried into Brest, and many of them died,
because they were not used to live in a jail; but, for my part,
it was nothing to me, for I was seasoned. One night, as I
was sleeping on the bed of boards, with a warm blanket about
me (for I always loved to lie well), I was awakened by the
boatswain, who had a dark lantern in his hand. "Jack' says

he to me, 'will you knock out the French sentry's brains ?
• I don't care,' says I, striving to keep myself awake, if I
lend a land.' Then follow me,' says he; ' and I hope we shall
do business.' So up I got, and went with him to fight the
Frenchmen.
Though we had no arms, we went down to the door,
where both the sentries were posted, and rushing upon them,
seized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down.
From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and, seizing
the first boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to sea.
We had not been here three days, before we were taken up
by the Dorset privateer, who were glad of so many good hands,
and we consented to run our chance. However, we had not
as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with
the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but
twenty-three, so to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The
fight lasted for three hours, and I verily believe we should
have taken the Frenchman, had we but had some more men
left behind; but, unfortunately, we lost all our men just as
we were going to get the victory.
“I was once more in the power of the French, and I believe
it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to
Brest; but by good fortune we were retaken by the Viper.
I had almost forgot to tell you that in that engagement I was
wounded in two places: I lost four fingers of the left hand,
and my leg was shot off. If I had had the good fortune to
have lost my leg and the use of my hand on board a king's
ship, and not aboard a privateer, I should have been entitled
to clothing and maintenance during the rest of my life. But
that was not my chance; one man is born with a silver spoon
in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However,
blessed be God ! I enjoy good health, and will for ever love
Liberty and Old England. Liberty, Property, and Old Eng-
and for ever, huzza.'
Thus saying, he limped off, leaving me in admiration at his
intrepidity and content. Nor could I avoid acknowledging
that an habitual acquaintance with misery serves better than
philosophy to teach us to despise it.

INCIDENT IN THE FRENCH CAMP.
a
You know, we French stormed Ratisbon:
A mile or so away
On a little mound, Napoleon
Stood on our storming-day;
With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow
Oppressive with its mind.
Just as perhaps he mused, "My plans
That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes
Waver at yonder wall,
Out 'twixt the battery smokes there flew
A rider, bound on bound
Full galloping; nor bridle drew
Until he reached the mound.
!
Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
By just his horse's mane, a boy;
You hardly could suspect-
(So tight he kept his lips compressed,
Scarce any blood came through)
You looked twice ere you saw his breast
Was all but shot in two.
“ Well,” he cried, “ Emperor, by God's
grace
We've got you Ratisbon !
The Marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon
To see your flag-bird flap his vans
Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!” The chief's eye flashed; his plans
Soared up again like fire.
The chief's eye flashed; but presently
Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the
other eagle's eye
When her bruised eaglet breathes :
“ You ʼRE WOUNDED !” « Nay,” his soldier's pride
Touched to the quick, he said :
" I'M KILLED, SIRE!” And, his chief beside,
Smiling the boy fell dead.-Browning.

TELL, ALBERT (his Son), GESLER, and SARNEM.

thy knees, and beg for mercy.
Ges. Does he hear?
Sar. He does, but braves thy power, Down, slave, and

ask for life.
Ges. [to Tell.] Why speak'st thou not?
Tell. For wonder! Yes, for wonder that thou seem'st a
man.
Ges. What should I seem ?
Tell. A monster.
Ges. Ha! Beware !-think on thy chains.
Tell. Think on my chains ! How came they on me?
Ges. Dar'st thou question me! Beware my vengeance.
Tell. Can it more than kill?
Ges. Enough ; it may do that.
Tell. No, not enough:-it cannot take away
the
grace
of
life—the comeliness of look that virtue gives—its port erect,
with consciousness of truth its rich attire of honourable
deeds—its fair report that's rife on good men's tongues :—it
cannot lay its hand on these, no more than it can pluck his
brightness from the sun, or with polluted finger tarnish it.
Ges. But it may make thee writhe.
Tell. It may, and I may say, “Go on!” though it should
make me groan again.
Ges. Whence comest thou ?
Tell. From the mountains; there they watch no more the
avalanche.
Ges. Why so ?
Tell. Because they look for thee.
The hurricane comes
unawares upon them: from its bed the torrent breaks and
finds them in its track-
Ges. What then ?
Tell. They thank kind providence it is not thou !—Thou
hast perverted nature in them. The earth presents her fruits
to them, and is not thanked. There's not a blessing Heaven
vouchsafes them, but the thought of thee doth wither to a
curse—as something they must lose, and had far better lack.
Ges. 'Tis well. I'd have them as their hills—that never
smile, though wanton summer tempt them e'er so much.
Tell. But they do sometimes smile.
Ges. Ah !When is that?

Tell. When they do talk of vengeance ! and the true hands
are lifted up to Heaven on every hill for justice on thee!

Now I will take ex-

thy skill
with that same bow. 'Tis said thy arrows never miss.
Tell. What is the trial.
Ges. Thou look'st upon thy boy as though instinctively thou
guessest it.
Tell. Look upon my boy! What mean you? Look upon
my boy as though I guessed it!-Guessed at the trial thou
wouldst have me make!-- Guessed it—instinctively! Thou
dost not mean—no, nomThou wouldst not have me make a
trial of my skill upon my child ? Impossible! I do not guess
thy meaning.
Ges. I'd see thee hit an apple on his head, three hundred
paces off.
Tell. Great Heaven !
Ges. On this condition I will spare his life and thine.
Tell. Ferocious monster! make a father murder his own
child !—'Tis beyond horror ! 'tis too much for flesh and blood
to bear.
Ges. Dost thou consent?
Tell. My hands are free from blood, and have no gust for
it, that they should drink my child's. I'll not murder my
boy for Gesler ?
Boy. You will not hit me, father. You'll be sure to hit the
apple. Will you not save me, father ?

Tell. Speak not to me;-let me not hear thy voice—thou

Ges. When all is ready. Sarnem, measure hence the dis-
tance—three hundred paces.
Tell. Will he do it fairly?
Ges. What is't to thee, fairly or not?
Tell. Oh, nothing! a little thing! a very little thing! I only
shoot at my child? [Sarnem prepares to measure.] Villain,
stop! You measure 'gainst the sun.
Ges. And what of that? What matter whether to or from
the sun?

the mark, and not on him that shoots: I will not shoot against
the sun.

Tell. You've picked the smallest one.
Ges. I know I have. Thy skill will be the greater if thou
hittest it.
Tell. True true! I did not think of that. I wonder I
did not think of that. A larger one had given me a chance
to save my boy. Give me my bow and quiver.
Ges. [To an attendant.] Give him a single arrow.
Tell. (Looks at it and breaks it.] Let me see my quiver. It
is not one arrow in a dozen I would use to shoot with at a

Ges. Shew him the quiver.

meanwhile Tell conceals an arrow under his garment. He then
selects another arrow.]
Tell. Is the boy ready? Keep silence now for Heaven's
sake, and be my witnesses, that, if his life's in peril from my
hand, 'tis only for the chance of saving it. For mercy's sake
keep motionless and silent !

with the apple on the arrow's point.]

The night was falling dreary in merry Bandon town,
When in his cottage weary an Orangeman lay down,
Beside the waters, laving the feet of aged trees,
The Orange banners waving, flew boldly in the breeze-
In mighty chorus meeting, a hundred voices join,
And fife and drum were beating the “Battle of the Boyne."
Ha! toward his cottage hieing, what form is speeding now,
From yonder thicket flying, with blood upon his brow?

“Hide-hide me, worthy stranger, though Green my colour be,
And in the day of danger may Heaven remember thee?
In yonder vale contending alone against that crew,
My life and limbs defending, an Orangeman I slew.
-Hark! hear that fearful warning ! there's death in every
tone-
Oh, save my life till morning, and Heaven prolong your own."
The Orange heart was melted in pity to the Green;
He heard the tale, and felt it his very soul within.
“ Dread not that angry warning, though death be in its tone,
I'll save your life till morning, or I will lose my own.'
Now, round his lowly dwelling, the angry torrent pressed
A hundred voices swelling, the Orangeman addressed —
“ Arise, arise, and follow the chase along the plain!
In yonder stony hollow your only son is slain!"
With rising shouts they gather upon the track amain,
And leave the childless father aghast with sudden pain.
He seeks the righted stranger in covert where he lay-
“ Arise!” he said, “ all danger is gone and passed away!
I had a son-one only, one loved as my life,
Thy hand has left me lonely, in that accursed strife.
I pledged my word to save thee until the storm should cease,
I keep the pledge I gave thee-arise, and go in peace!"
The stranger soon departed from that unhappy vale;
The father, broken-hearted, lay brooding o'er the tale.
Full twenty summers after, to silver turned his beard;
And yet the sound of laughter from him was never heard.

The night was falling dreary in merry Wexford town,
When in his cabin weary, a peasant laid him down.
Beside the waters, laving the feet of aged trees,
The Green flag, gaily waving, was spread against the breeze,
In mighty chorus meeting loud voices filled the town,
And fife and drum were beating, "Down, Orangeman, lie down.'
Hark ! 'mid the stirring clangour that woke the echoes there,
Loud voices, high in anger, rise on the evening air.
Like billows of the ocean, he sees them hurry on-
And, 'mid the wild commotion, an Orangeman alone.
My hair,” he said, “ is hoary, and feeble is my hand,
And I could tell a story would shame your cruel band.
Full twenty years and over have changed my heart and brow,
And I am grown a lover of peace and concord now.

It was not thus I greeted your brother of the Green,
When fainting and defeated I freely took him in.
I pledged my word to save him from vengeance rushing on,
I kept the pledge I gave him, though he had killed my son.”
That aged peasant heard him, and knew him as he stood,
Remembrance kindly stirred him, and tender gratitude.
With gushing tears of pleasure, he pierced the listening train,
“I'm here to pay the measure of kindness back again !”
Upon his bosom falling, the old man's tears came down;
Deep memory recalling that cot and fatal town.
“ The hand that would offend thee, my being first shall end;
I'm living to defend thee, my saviour and my friend!”
”
He said, and slowly turning, addressed the wondering crowd;
With fervent spirit burning, he told the tale aloud.
Now pressed the warm beholders their aged foe to greet:
They raised him on their shoulders and chaired him through
the street.
As he had saved that stranger, from peril scowling dim,
So in his day of danger did Heaven remember him.
By joyous crowds attended, the worthy pair were seen,
And their flags that day were blended, of Orange and of Green

Upon the witness of these gentlemen,

In the dead waste and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point, exactly, cap-a-pie,
Appears before them, and, with a solemn march,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them, the third night kept the watch:
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes : I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
Ham. But where was this?

But answer made it none: yet once, methought,

But, even then, the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.

Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

THE SHERIFF OF SAUMUR.
ONCE when the king was travelling through
His realm, as kings were wont to do
In ancient times, when royalty
Was deemed å goodly sight to see,
It chanced the Sheriff of Saumur
(A city in the royal tour,)
Was chosen by the magistrates
To meet the monarch at the gates,
And in a handsome speech declare
How glad and proud the people were
To see his Majesty ; and say
Such compliments as subjects pay,
As being but the proper thing
On such occasions, to the king.
“Sire!” said the sheriff (so the speech
Began, of course,) “Sire! we beseech
Your gracious majesty to hear
The humble words of hearty cheer
With which-great Sire !-with which, through me,
The people greet your majesty.
We are so glad to see you, Sire,
That-that -” And here the speech hung fire!
"So glad—the people of our town-
That—that—" And here the man broke down!
Whereat a courtier said, “I'm sure
These worthy people of Saumur
Are glad; my liege, to see you here;
That seems to me extremely clear;
And don't his Honour's speech confess it?
So glad, indeed, they CAN'T EXPRESS IT!"-J. G. Saxe,

SPEECH OF BELJAL DISSUADING FROM WAR.
259
SPEECH OF BELIAL DISSUADING FROM WAR.
I SHOULD be much for open war, Oh Peers, as not behind in
liate, if what was urged main reason to persuade immediate
war, did not dissuade me. most, and seem to cast ominous con-
jecture on the whole success :—when he, who most excels in
fact of arms, in what he counsels and in what excels: mistrust-
ful, grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution; as
the scope of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what
revenge? The towers of heaven are filled with armèd watch,
that render all access impregnable; oft on the bordering deep
encamp their legions, or, with obscure wing, scout far and
wide into the realm of night, scorning surprise. Or, could
we break our way by force, and at our heels all hell should
rise in blackest insurrection, to confound heaven's purest
light; yet, our Great Enemy, all incorruptible, would on His
throne sit unpolluted; and the etherial mould, incapable of
stain, would soon expel her mischief, and purge off the baser
fire victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope is flat despair.
We must exasperate the Almighty Victor to spend all his rage
--and that must end us! that must be our cure, TO BE NO
MORE: Sad Cure! for, who would lose, though full of pain, this
intellectual being? those thoughts that wander through
eternity, to perish rather,swallowed up and lost in the wide
womb of uncreated night, devoid of sense and motion! And
who knows, (let this be good,) whether our angry Foe can
give it? or will ever? How he can- -is doubtful; that He never
will is sure.
Will He, so wise, let loose at once his ire,-be-
like through impotence, or unaware,—to give his enemies
their wish; and end them in His anger, whom his anger saves
to punish endless? " Wherefore cease we then?” say they
who counsel war; “we are decreed, reserved, and destined to
eternal woe: whatever doing, what can we suffer more?' what
can we suffer worse?" Is this then worse, thus sitting, thus
consulting, thus in arms! What! when we fled amain,
pursued and struck with Heaven's afflicting thunder, and be-
sought the deep to shelter us? this Hell then seemed a refuge
from those wounds; or when we lay chained on the burning
lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindled
those grim fires, awaked, should blow them into sevenfold
rage, and plunge us in the flames; or, from above, should
intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague
us! What if all her stores were opened, and this firmament
of hell should spout his cataracts of fire,-impendent horrors,

threatening hideous, fall one day upon our heads! while we,
perhaps, designing or exhorting glorious war, caught in a fiery
tempest, shall be hurled, each on his rock transfixed :-the
sport and prey of racking whirlwinds; and for ever sunk under

everlasting groans, unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, ages of
hopeless end! This would be worse! War, therefore, open or

MARGUERITE OF FRANCE.
The Moslem spears were gleaming round Damietta's towers,
Though a Christian banner from her wall waved free its lily-
flowers.
Ay! proudly did the banner wave, as queen of earth and air;
But faint hearts throbbed beneath its folds in anguish and
despair.
Deep, deep in Paynim dungeon their kingly chieftain lay,
And low on many an Eastern field, their knighthood's best
array
'Twas mourning when at feast they met, the wine-cup round to
send;
For each that touched it silently then missed a gallant friend.
And mournful was their vigil on the beleaguered wall,
And dark their slumber,-dark with dreams of slow defeat
and fall.
Yet a few hearts of chivalry rose high to breast the storm,
And one-of all the loftiest there—thrilled in a Woman's
form!
A Woman, meekly bending o'er the slumber of her child,
With her soft, sad eyes of weeping love,—as the Virgin
Mother's mild!
Oh! roughly cradled was the babe, 'midst the clash of spear
and lance,
And a strange wild bower was thine, young queen! fair Mar-
guerite of France!
A dark and vaulted chamber, like a scene for wizard-spell,
Deep in the Saracenic gloom of the warrior citadel;
And there, 'midst arms, the couch was spread, and with
banners curtained o'er,
For the daughter of the minstrel-land, -the gay Provençal
shore.

MARGUERITE OF FRANCE.

For the bright queen of St. Louis, the Star of court and hall!
But the deep strength of the gentle heart, wakes to the tem-
pest's call.
Her lord was in the Payniin's hold; his soul with grief
oppressed;
Yet calmly lay she, desolate, with her young babe on her
breast!
There were voices in the city, voices of wrath and fear-
“ The walls grow weak, the strife is vain-we will not perish
here!
Yield ! yield! and let the Crescent gleam o'er tower and bas-
tion high!
Our distant homes are beautiful-we stay not here to die.”
They bore those fearful tidings to the sad queen where she
lay-
They told a tale of wavering hearts, of treason and dismay:
The blood rushed through her pearly cheeks, the sparkle to
а.
her eye--
“Now call me hither those recreant knights---from the bands
of Italy !"
Then through the vaulted chamber stern iron footsteps rang;
And heavily the sounding floor gave back the sabre's clang.
They stood around her-steel-clad men, moulded for storm
and fight;
But they quailed before the loftier soul, in that pale aspect
bright.
Yes! as before the falcon shrinks the bird of meaner wing,
So shrank they from the imperial glance of her,—that fragile
thing!
And her flute-like voice rose clear and high, through the din
of arms around
Sweet, and yet stirring to the soul, as a silver clarion's sound.
“ The honour of the Lily is in your hands to keep,
And the banner of the Cross, for Him who died on Calvary's
steep ;
And the
city which, for Christian prayer, hath heard the holy
Bell :-
And is it these your hearts would yield to the godless infidel ?
“ Then bring me here a breast-plate and a helm, before ye fly,
And I will gird my woman's form, and on the ramparts die !

And the boy-whom I have born for woe, but never for

Shall go within mine arms to death-meet for his royal race !

Then go, and, with the Cross, forsake the princely babe of
France!
But tell
your
homes
you left one heart to perish undefiled;
A Woman, and a Queen, to guard her honour and her child !"
Before her words they thrilled :-like hares when winds are
in the woods;
And a deepening murmur told of men roused to a loftier
mood.
And her babe awoke to flashing swords, unsheathed in many
a hand,
As they gathered round the helpless one, again a noble band !
“We are thy warriors, Lady ! true to the cross and thee !
The spirit of thy kindling words on every sword shall be.
Rest, with the fair child on thy breast; Rest-we will guard
thee well.

LUCY GRAY.
OFT I had heard of Lucy Gray,
And when I cross'd the wild,
I chanced to see, at break of day,
The solitary child.
No mate, no comrade, Lucy knew;
She dwelt on a wild moor-
The sweetest thing that ever grew
Beside a human door!
You yet may spy the fawn at play,
The hare
upon
the
green,
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.
« To-night will be a stormy night-
You to the town must go;
And take the lantern, child, to light
Your mother through the snow.”

LUCY GRAY.

“ That, father, will I gladly do!
'Tis scarcely afternoon-
The minster clock has just struck two,
And yonder is the moon!"
At this the father raised his hook
And snapp'd a faggot band ;
He plied his work, and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.
Not blyther is the mountain roe;
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse the powd'ry snow
That rises up like smoke.
The storm came on before its time;
She wander'd up and down,
And many a hill did Lucy climb,
But never reach'd the town.
The wretched parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve-them for a guide.
At daybreak on a hill they stood
That overlook'd the moor,
And thence they saw the bridge of wood
A furlong from their door.
And, turning homeward, now they cried,
" In heaven we all shall meet!”
When in the snow the mother spied
The print of Lucy's feet.
Then downward from the steep hill's edge
They track'd the foot-marks small,
And through the broken hawthorn hedge,
And by the long stone wall.
And then an open field they crossid,
The marks were still the same;
They track'd them on, nor ever lost,
And to the bridge they came.
They follow'd from the stony bank
The footmarks one by one,
Into the middle of the plank,
And further there were none.

Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living child;
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome wild.
O'er rough and smooth she trips along,
And never looks behind,
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind. — Wordsworth.
THE JESTER CONDEMNED TO DEATH.
ONE of the Kings of Scanderoon,
A Royal Jester,
Had in his train a gross buffoon,
Who used to pester
The court with tricks inopportune,
Venting on the highest folk his
Scurvy pleasantries and hoaxes.
It needs some sense to play the fool,
Which wholesome rule
Occurr'd not to our jackanapes,
Who consequently found his freaks
Lead to innumerable scrapes,
And quite as many kicks and tweaks,
Which only seemed to make him faster
Try the patience of his master.
Some sin, at last, beyond all measure,
Incurr'd the desperate displeasure
Of his serene and raging highness:
Whether he twitch'd his most revered
And sacred beard,
Or had intruded on the shyness
Of the Seraglio, or let fly
An epigram at royalty,
None knows: his sin was an occult one;
But records tell us that the Sultan,
Meaning to terrify the knave,
Exclaim'd—“'Tis time to stop that breath;
Thy doom is seal’d: presumptuous slave!
Tbou stand'st condemned to certain death.

CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE,

Silence, base rebel! no replying !
But such is my indulgence still,
That, of my own free grace and will,
I leave to thee the mode of dying."
“Thy royal will be done—’tis just,"
Replied the wretch, and kiss'd the dust;

Your Majesty's humane decree
Has deign'd to leave the choice to me,
I'll die, so please you—OF OLD AGE!”—Horace Smith.

Not though the soldiers knew

Their's not to make reply,
Their's but to do and die;-

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,

Volleyed and thundered :
Stormed at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well;
Into the jaws of death,
Into the mouth of hell,-

Flashed all at once in air,

Charging an army,--while
All the world wonder'd:
Plunged in the battery smoke,
Fiercely the line they broke;

Pieeled from the sabre stroke,
Shaken and sundered:
Then they rode back,—but not,-
Not the six hundred !

Up from the mouth of hell,
All that was left of them,-
Left of six hundred !

DEATH OF MARMION.
With fruitless labour, Clara bound and strove to stanch the
gushing wound: the Monk, with unavailing cares, exhausted
all the Church's prayers. Ever, he said, that, close and near,
a lady's voice was in his ear, and that the priest he could not
hear, for that she ever sung, -—“ In the lost battle, borne down
by the flying, where mingles war's rattle with groans of the
dying!” So the notes rung;-"Avoid thee, fiend !-with
cruel hand, shake not the dying sinner's sand !--Oh, look my
son, upon yon sign of the Redeemer's grace divine; Oh, think
on faith and bliss !—By many a death-bed I have been, and
many a sinner's parting seen, but never aught like this."

EVE OF WATERLOO.

The war, that for a space did fail, now trebly thundering
swell’d the gale, and STANLEY! was the cry ;-a light on
Marmion's visage spread, and fired his glazing eye: with
dying hand, above his head he shook the fragment of his
blade, and shouted “ VICTORY !_CHARGE, CHESTER, CHARGE !
ON, STANLEY, ON!” were the last words of Marmion.—Sir
Walter Scott.
EVE OF WATERLOO.
THERE was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell;
But hush ! hark ! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell I
Did ye not hear it ?No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
On with the dance ! let joy be unconfined ; .
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet;
But hark !—that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before !
ARM! ARM! IT IS—IT IS--THE CANNON'S OPENING ROAR!
Within a windowed niche of that high hall
Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain ; he did hear
That sound the first amidst the festival,
And caught its tone with Death’s prophetic ear;
And when they smiled because he deemed it near;
His heart more truly knew that peal too well
Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell :
He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.
Ah ! then, and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness ;

And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated : who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise !
And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
And near, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While throng'd the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering, with white lips-“THE FOE! THEY COME !
THEY COME!”
And wild and high the “ Cameron's gathering" rose,
The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes :-
How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills-
Savage and shrill ! But with the breath which fills
Their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers
With the fierce native daring which instils
The stirring memory of a thousand years,
And Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears
And Ardennes waves above them her
green leaves,
Dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
Over the unreturning brave,-alas !
Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
Of living valour, rolling on the foe,
And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.
Last noon, beheld them full of lusty life,
Last eve, in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
The midnight, brought the signal-sound of strife,
The morn, the marshalling in arms,—the day
Battle's magnificently-stern array!
The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
The earth is cover'd thick with other clay,
Which her own clay shall cover, heap'd and pent,
Rider and horse,-friend, foe,-in one red burial blent !

Mar. The usual fate of a large mansion. Having first
ruined the master by good house-keeping, it at last comes to
levy contributions as an inn.

I have been often surprised that you who have seen so much
of the world could never yet acquire a requisite share of
Mar. Where could I have learned that assurance you talk
of? My life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn, in
seclusion from that part of the creation that chiefly teach
men confidence.
Hast. You look sometimes for all the world as if you wanted
an opportunity of stealing out of the room.
Mar. Why, man, that's because I do want to steal out of
Faith, I have often formed a resolution to break
the ice, and rattle away at any rate ; but I don't know how-
a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my
resolution. An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty,
but I'll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impu-
dence. I can't say fine things to ladies--they freeze, they
petrify me. They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain,
or some such bagatelle ; but to me, a modest woman, drest
out in all her finery, is the most tremendous object of the
whole creation.
Hast. I pity you! But how do you intend behaving to the
lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father?
Mar. As I behave to all other ladies. Bow very low-
answer yes, or no, to all her demands ; but for the rest, I don't
think I shall venture to look in her face till I see my father's

Miss N. My dear Mr. Hastings ! To what accident am I to
ascribe this happy meeting?
Hast. Rather let me ask the same question, as I could never
have hoped to meet Miss Neville at an inn.
Miss I. An inn ! you mistake : my aunt, my guardian,
lives here. What could induce you to think this house an inn?

Mar. The assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond

and then, I suppose, we are to run the gauntlet through all
the rest of the family. What have we got here.

most fortunate accident! Who do you think has just alighted?
Mar. Cannot guess.
Hast. Miss Hardcastle, and Miss Neville. Give me leave
to introduce Miss Constance Neville to your acquaintance.
Happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called, on their
return, to take fresh horses here. Miss Hardcastle has just
stepped into the next room, and will be back in an instant.

conscience, and here comes something to complete my embar-

much of the finest company, can find little entertainment in
an obscure corner of the country.
Mar. I have lived, indeed, in the world, Madam ; but I

I have been but an observer

Miss H. An observer like you, upon life, were I fear
disagreeably employed, since you must have had much more
to censure than to approve.
Mar. Pardon me, Madam : I was always willing to be
amused. The folly of most people is rather an object of my
mirth than uneasiness.

your whole life. Well ! Miss Hardcastle, I see that you and
Mr. Marlow are going to be very good company. I believe
our being here will but embarrass the interview.

EVENING IN PARADISE.

EVENING IN PARADISE.
Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray had in her
sober livery all things clad: Silence accompanied; for Beast
and Bird, they to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
were slunk,-all but the wakeful nightingale; she, all night
long, her amorous descant sung; Silence was pleased. Now
glowed the Firmament with living sapphires: Hesperus, that
led the starry host, rode brightest; till the Moon, rising in
clouded majesty, at length (apparent queen!) unveild her
peerless light, and o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.
When Adam thus to Eve:-“Fair Consort, the hour of night,
and all things now retired to rest, mind us of like repose;
since God hath set labour and rest, as day and night, to men
successive; and the timely dew of sleep, now falling with
soft slumbrous weight, inclines our eyelids; other creatures
all day long rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; man
hath his daily work of body or mind appointed, -which
declares his dignity, and the regard of Heaven on all his
ways; while other animals unactive range, and of their
doings God takes no account. To-morrow, ere fresh morning
streak the east with first approach of light, we must be risen,
and at our pleasant labour,-to reform yon flowery arbours,
yonder alleys green-our walk at noon, with branches over-
grown,—that mock our scant manuring, and require more
hands than ours to lop their wanton growth: those blossoms
also, and those dropping gums, that lie bestrewn, unsightly
and unsmooth, ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
meanwhile, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest." To whom
thus Eve with perfect beauty adorned :-"My Author and
Disposer! what thou bid’st, unargued I obey; so God ordains;
God is thy law, thou mine: to know no more is woman's
happiest knowledge and her praise. With thee conversing, I
forget all time; all seasons, and their change, all please alike.
Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, with charm of
earliest birds; pleasant the Sun, when first, on this delightful
land, he spreads his orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and
flower, glistening with dew; fragrant the fertile Earth after
soft showers; and sweet the coming on of grateful Evening
mild; then silent Night, with this her solemn bird, and this
fair moon, and these—the gems of Heaven!—her starry train:
but neither breath of Morn, when she ascends with charm of

this her solemn bird; nor walk by Moon, or glittering star-
light,-WITHOUT THEE, IS SWEET — Milton.
SOMEBODY'S DARLING.
INTO a ward of the white-washed halls,
Where the dead and the dying lay,
Wounded by bayonets, shells, and balls,
Somebody's darling was borne one day-
Somebody's darling, so young and so brave,
Wearing yet on his pale sweet face,
Soon to be hid in the dust of the grave,
The lingering light of his boyhood's grace.
Matted and damp are the curls of gold,
Kissing the snow of that fair young brow,
Pale are the lips of delicate mould
Somebody's darling is dying now.
Back from his beautiful blue-veined brow,
Brush all the wandering waves of gold;
Cross his hands on his bosom now-
Somebody's darling is still and cold.
Kiss him once for Somebody's sake,
Murmur a prayer soft and low;
One bright curl from the cluster take
They were Somebody's pride, we know:
Somebody's hand has rested there;
Was it a mother's, soft and white?
And have the lips of a sister fair
Been baptized in those waves of light?
God knows best; he was somebody's love;
Somebody's heart enshrined him there;
Somebody wafted his name above,
Night and morn, on the wings of prayer.
Somebody wept when he marched away,
Looking so handsome, brave and grand;
Somebody's kiss on his forehead lay,
Somebody clung to his parting hand.

Yearning to hold him again to her heart;
There he lies—with his blue eyes dim,
And smiling, childlike lips apart.

Pausing to drop on his grave a tear;
Carve on the wooden slab at his head,

MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSSE, ANGUS, and WITCHES.
Ban. How far is 't call'd to Forres! What are these,
So wither'd, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.
Macb. Speak, if you can,-What are you?
1st Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis !
2nd Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
3rd Witch. All hail, Macbeth! that shall be KING HEREAFTER.
Ban. Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fairl--I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that, indeed,
Which outwardly you shew! My noble partner
Ye greet with present grace, and great prediction
Of noble having, and of royal hope,
That he seems wrapt withal: To me you speak not:
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say, which grain will grow, and which will not ;
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor you hate.
1st Witch. Hail !
2nd Witch. Hail !
3rd Witch. Hail !
1st Witch. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

2nd Witch. Not so happy, yet much happier.
3rd Witch. Thy sons be kings, though thou be none:
So, all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
1st Witch. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail !
Macb. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more !
By Sinel's death, I know, I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor ? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentlemen; and, to be King,
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you.
(Witches vanish.]
Ban. The earth has bubbles as the water has,
And these are of them :-whither are they vanish'd ?
Macb. Into the air; and what seemed corporal melted
As breath into the wind.--'Would they had staid !
Ban. Were such things here, as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten of the insane root,
That takes the reason prisoner.
Macb. Your children shall be kings!
Ban. YOU SHALL BE KING!
Macb. And thane of Cawdor too; went it not so ?
Ban. To the self-same tune and words. Who's here?
Rosse. The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success: and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend,
Which should be thine, or his: Silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the self-same day.
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afеar'd of what thyself didst make
Strange images of_DEATH. As thick as tale,
Came post with post; and every one did bear,
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane !
For it is thine.
Ban. What, can the women speak true?
Macb. Glamis, and thane of Cawdor:
The greatest is behind.—Thanks for your pains.-
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

When those, that gave the thane of Cawdor to me,
Promised no less to them?
Ban. That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But, 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths ;
Win us with honest trifles, to betray us
In deepest consequence.-
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
Ι
Macb. Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill; cannot be good : If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor :
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion,
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings :
My thought, whose murder yet is fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man, that function
Is smother'd in surmise; and nothing is,
But what is not.
- Ban. Look, how our partner's rapt.
Macb. If chance will have me King, why,chance may crown me,
stir.
Ban. New honours come upon
him
Like our strange garments,--cleave not to their mould,
But with the aid of use.
Macb. Come what come may;
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
Ban. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
Macb. Give me your favour :—my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them.-Let us toward the king.--
Think upon what hath chanced; and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

A RAILWAY CHASE.
[By kind permission of his friend The Author.)
The runaway engine and train had got the start of them by
nearly two miles. If the express was true to her time, there
was no hope. In five or six minutes there would be a collision,
But if the express was in the least behind, there was still a
desperate chance. Away, then, and away!
On they went, with thundering crank and grinding steel.
The tender quivered and rocked; the ground, lit by the
glare of the engine lamps, swept like lightning under them.
There was a terrible voice in the quick, clanking wheels
“Life or death life or death life or death!” Away
and away, like a fiery meteor through the driving storm and
darkness! The telegraph poles flew past like frighted spirits.
“ There !—there she is thank Heav'n!" burst from the lips
of both men, as they caught sight at last of two red lights
shining far a-head upon the line.
They dashed with a shattering roar between the rocks at
Elmslie's farm, burst forth again, and away on the wild and
terrible pursuit. They were gaining rapidly on the train
a-head. There was hope. They dashed with another roar
under the beetling bridge beyond the junction, and still
away and away: « Life or death life or death !-life or
death !" clanked the wheels.
Just as the long train was thundering along the iron
bridge near Blackford, they dashed alongside. The Parlia-
mentary train was bowling along the parallel rails at the
velocity of nearly thirty miles an hour; and as Sinclair and
Blacklock passed carriage after carriage, they could see, in the
dusky light of the lamps within, the dim rows of passengers,
many of them asleep, and all unconscious that they were on the
wrong line, bowling, quick and fast, into the jaws of death.
On they thundered till they came abreast of the engine.
Campbell was there, but apparently stupefied with drink,
sitting on the seat under the storm-board, with his head
hanging down nearly to his knees.
Blacklock shouted and yelled at the pitch of his voice;
Sinclair blew the whistle; but Campbell could not be roused.
“Let's dash a-head and signal the Express to stop," cried
Sinclair, excitedly.
He pulled out his watch and stooped to see the time. Eight
minutes to eleven! The Express was two minutes behind
her time already. There was not a moment to lose.

HESPERUS.”
“Lord have mercy !" gasped Blacklock, clutching Sinclair's
arm convulsively; « here she comes ! !”
He was right. Far a-head along the line, two points of
light, like the eyes of a basilisk, had glided into view, and
were fast dilating and growing brighter and fiercer as the
iron monster from the south came on through the darkness at
the rate of a mile a minute. Already the thunder of its
approach was distinctly perceptible. Scarcely a mile sepa-
rated the two trains--in thirty seconds they would be
together!
“Signal signal the express !" shrieked Blacklock. But
Campbell's engine ! how was it to be checked? Blacklock
looked at the narrow space that separated the two engines.
A few feet-only a few feet !—and a hundred human lives at
stake!
“I'LL JUMP !” he cried. In a moment, before Sinclair
could hold him back, he had crouched and made the desperate
spring. He alighted upon the footboard of the other tender.
He staggered for a moment; but, recovering his balance,
sprang forward to the engine, shut off the steam, and put on
the brake. It was all the brave fellow could do. Now for
life--for life! He seized the drunken man. He dragged
him to the side of the engine to leap off, when in an instant
the Express, with its flying plume and its glaring irids,
magnifying into two great orbs of flame, flashed through the
darkness, and like a thunderbolt shot full
upon
them!
The earth shook with the terrific shock. The engines were
smashed, the furnace fires flared up, the huge carriages of both
trains came on like successive explosions, leaping madly over
one another, while a thousand shrieks rang wildly up into the
shuddering air of night.-David Macrae.

THE WRECK OF THE “HESPERUS.”
It was the schooner “Hesperus,"
That sailed the wintry sea;
And the skipper had taken his little daughter
To bear him company.
Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,
Her cheeks like the dawn of day,
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,
That

The skipper he stood beside the helm,
His pipe was in his mouth,
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow,
The smoke now west, now south.
Then up and spake an old sailor,
Had sailed the Spanish Main,
“I
pray thee, put into yonder port,
For I fear a hurricane.
“Last night, the moon had a golden ring,
And to-night no moon we see !"
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,
And a scornful laugh laughed he.
Colder and louder blew the wind,
A gale from the north-east;
The snow fell hissing in the brine,
And the billows frothed like yeast.
Down came the storm and smote amain
The vessel in its strength;
She shuddered and paused, like a frightened steed,
Then leaped her cable's length.
“ Come hither! come bither ! my little daughter,
And do not tremble so;
For I can weather the roughest gale,
That ever wind did blow."
He wrapped her in his seaman's coat
Against the stinging blast;
He cut a rope from a broken spar,
And bound her to the mast.
“O Father! I hear the church-bells ring;
Oh, say, what it may be ?"
“'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast !"
And he steered for the open sea.
61 O Father! I hear the sound of
guns ;
Oh, say, what it may be?"
“Some ship in distress that cannot live
In such an angry sea !"
“O Father! I see a gleaming light;
Oh, say, what may it be ? '
But the father answered never a word,
A frozen corpse was he.

Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,
With his face turned to the skies,
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
On his fixed and glassy eyes.
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
That saved she might be;
And she thought of Him, who stilled the wave
On the Lake of Galilee.
And fast through the midnight dark and drear
Through the whistling sleet and snow,
Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept
Towards the reef of Norman's Woe.
And ever the fitful gusts between
A sound came from the land;
It was the sound of the trampling surf
On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
The breakers were right beneath her bows,
She drifted a dreary wreck,
And a whooping billow swept the crew
Like icicles from her deck.
SHE STRUCK—where the white and fleecy waves
Looked soft as carded wool;
But the cruel rocks, they gored her side
Like the horns of an angry bull.
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,
With the masts, went by the board ;
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,
Ho! ho ! the breakers roared !
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach
A fisherman stood aghast,
To see the form of a maiden fair
Lashed close to a drifting mast.
The salt sea was frozen on her breast
The salt tears in her eyes ;
And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,
On the billows fall and rise.
Such was the wreck of the “Hesperus,"
In the midnight and the snow !
Oh save us all from a death like this,
On the reef of Norman's Woo !- Longfellow.

OF Man's first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden
tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world, and all
our woe, with loss of Eden,-till one greater Man restore us,
and regain the blissful seat,--sing, heavenly Muse! that, on
the secret top of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire that shepherd,
who first taught the chosen seed, in the beginning, how the
heavens and earth rose out of Chaos : or, if Sion hill delight
thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed fast by the oracle of
God; I thence invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,—that,
with no middle flight, intends to soar above the Aonian
mount, while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or
rhyme. And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer, before
all temples, the upright heart and pure, instruct me, for Thou
know'st; Thou from the first wast present, and, with mighty
wings outspread, dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss,
and madest it pregnant. What is in me dark, illumine;
what is low, raise and support; that to the height of this
great argument, I may assert eternal Providence, and justify
the ways of God to men.--Milton.

THE SOLDIER'S DREAM.
OUR bugles sang truce, for the night-cloud had lowered,
And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky;
And thousands had sunk on the ground overpowered,
The weary to sleep, and the wounded to die.
When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,
By the wolf-scaring faggot that guarded the slain,
At the dead of the night a sweet vision I saw;
And thrice ere the morning I dreamed it again.
Methought, from the battle-field's dreadful array,
Far, far I had roamed on a desolate track;
'Twas autumn,--and sunshine arose on the way
To the home of my fathers, that welcomed me back.

I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft
In life's morning march, when my bosom was young;
I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,
And knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung.
Then pledged we the wine cup, and fondly I swore
From my home and my weeping friends never to part;
My little ones kissed me a thousand times o'er,
And
my
wife sobbed aloud in her fullness of heart:-
“Stay, stay with us,-Rest;—Thou art weary and worn!"
And fain was their War-broken soldier to stay;
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn,
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.

Than all my skill can in a year repair.

And strangles him there when least aware,
And striketh the fatal blow,-
Hanging his victim high in the air,

And their tendrils coil around the victim's heart,
A rank and loathsome breed :
Blighting the spirit young and fair,
A villain in truth is old • Don't CARE!”
He meeteth bold manhood on his way,
And wrestleth with him there;
He falls a sure and an easy prey
To the strength of old “Don't Care:”
Then he plants his foot on the victim's breast
And shouteth with demon joy,
And treadeth the life from his panting heart,
And exulteth to destroy,
Crushing bold manhood everywhere;
A villain indeed is old “ Don't CARE!"
THE FOOT'S COMPLAINT.
“It's really too bad,” cried the Foot in a fever,
“ That I am thus walking and walking forever :
My mates are to honour and indolence thrust,
While here I am doomed to the mud and the dust.
“ There's the Mouth,-he's the fellow for all the nice things,
And the Ear only wakes when the dinner-bell rings;
The Hand with his rings decks his fingers so white;
And as to the Eye-he sees every fine sight.”
“Stay, stay," said the Mouth; "don't you know, my dear
,
brother,
We all were intended to help one another ?
And surely you can't be thought useless and mean,
On whom all the rest so entirely must lean.
“ Consider, my friend, we are labouring too,
And toiling-nay, don't interrupt me--for you;
Indeed, were it not for the Hand, Mouth, and Eye,
Of course, you know well, you would falter and die.
“I eat, but 'tis only that you may be strong;
The Hand works for you, friend, all the day long;
And the Eye—he declares he shall soon lose his sight,
So great are his efforts to guide you aright.”
The Foot in reply could find nothing to say,
For he felt he had talked in a culpable way,
And owned the reproof was both wise and well-meant,
For, wherever we are, we should there be content.

BLANCHE OF DEVAN-PART II.
Fitz-JAMES's mind was passion toss'd,
When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
But Murdoch's shout, suspicion wrought,
And Blanche's song, conviction brought.
Not like a stag that spies the snare,
But lion of the hunt aware,
He waved at once his blade on high,
“Disclose thy treachery, or die !”
Forth at full speed the clansman flew,
But in his race his bow he drew.
The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
And thrilled in Blanche's faded breast.
Murdoch of Alpine! prove thy speed,
For ne'er had Alpine's son such need !
With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
The fierce avenger is behind !
Fate judges of the rapid strife-
The forfeit, death-the prize is life!
Thy kindred ambush lies before,
Close couch'd upon the heathery moor;
Them couldst thou reach !-it may not be
Thine ambush'd kin thou ne'er shalt see,
The fiery Saxon gains on thee!
Resistless speeds
the deadly thrust,
As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain
Ere he can win his blade again.
Bent o'er the fall'n, with falcon eye,
He grimly smiled to see him die;
Then slower wended back his way,
Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.
She sate beneath the birchen tree,
Her elbow resting on her knee;
She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
And gazed on it, and feebly laugh'd;
Her wreath of hroom and feathers gray,
Daggled with blood, beside her lay.
The knight to stanch the life-stream tried,
“Stranger, it is in vain !" she cried.
" This hour of death has given me more
Of reason's
power
than
years
before.

For, as these ebbing veins decay,
My frenzied visions fade away.
A helpless injured wretch I die.
And something tells me in thine eye,
That thou wert mine avenger born.
Seest thou this tress f-Oh! still I've worn
This little tress of yellow hair,
Through danger, frenzy, and despair!
It once was bright and clear as thine,
But blood and tears have dimm'd its shine:
I will not tell thee when 'twas shred,
Nor from what guiltless victim's head-
My brain would turn !--but it shall wave
Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
And thou wilt bring it me again.-
I waver still.-0 Heav'n! more bright
Let reason beam her parting light!
Oh, by thy knighthood's honour'd sign,
And for thy life preserved by mine,
When thou shalt see a darksome man,
Who boasts him chief of Alpine's clan,
With tartans broad, and shadowy plume,
And hand of blood, and brow of gloom,
Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
And wreak poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!
They watch for thee by pass and fell-
Avoid the path-Farewell - Farewell !

Fast pour’d his eyes at pity's claims;
And now, with mingled grief and ire,
He saw the murder'd maid expire.
“Heav'n, in my need, be my relief,
As I wreak this on yonder chief !”
A lock from Blanche's tresses fair,
He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
And placed it on his bonnet-side:
BY HIM WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH! I swear,
No other favour will I wear,
Till this sad token I embrue
In the best blood of Roderick Dhu."
--Sir Walter Scott.

Love. WHERE have you been? I have wanted you
hour.
James. Whom do you want, Sir, your coachman or your
cook? for I am both one and the other.
Love. I want my cook.
James. I thought, indeed, it was not your coachman; for
you have had no great occasion for him since your last pair of
horses were starved; but your cook, Sir, shall wait upon you
in an instant. [Puts off his coachman's greatcoat, and appears
as a cook.] Now, Sir, I am ready for your commands.
Love. I am engaged this evening to give a supper.
James. A supper, Sir! I have not heard the word this half-
year; a dinner, indeed, now and then; but for a supper, I am
almost afraid, for want of practice, my hand is out.
Love. Leave off your saucy jesting, and see that you provide
a good supper.
James. That may be done with a great deal of money, Sir.
Love. Is the mischief in you? Always money! Can you
say nothing else but money, money, money? My children, my
servants, my relatives, can pronounce nothing but money.
James. Well, Sir, but how many will there be at table?
Love. About eight or ten; but I will have a supper dressed
but for eight; for if there be enough for eight, there is enough
for ten.
James. Suppose, Sir, at one end, a handsome soup; at the
other, a fine Westphalia ham and chickens ; on one side, a
fillet of veal; on the other a turkey, or rather a bustard,
which may be had for about a guinea-
Love. Zounds ! is the fellow providing an entertainmet for
my lord mayor and the court of aldermen?
James. Then a ragout-
Love. I'll have no ragout. Would you burst the good
people ?
James. Then, pray, Sir, say what will you have?
Love. Why, see and provide something to cloy their
stomachs ; let there be two good dishes of soup maigre; a
large suet-pudding; some dainty fat pork pie, very fat; a fine
small lean breast of mutton, and a large dish with two arti-
chokes. There ; that's plenty and variety.

KING, MILLER, and COURTIER.
King. No, no; this can be no public road, that's certain.
I have lost my way, undoubtedly. Of what advantage is it
now to be a king? Night shews me no respect ; I cannot see
better, nor walk so well as another man. When a king is
lost in a wood, what is he more than other men ? His wisdom
knows not which is north and which is south; his power a
beggar's dog would bark at, and the beggar himself would not
bow to his greatness. And yet how often are we puffed up
with these false attributes ! Well, in losing the monarch, I
have found the man. But, hark! somebody sure is near.
What is it best to do? Will my majesty protect me? No.
Throw majesty aside, then, and let manhood do it.
Miller. I believe I hear the rogue. Who's there?
King. No rogue, I assure you.

Miller. Little better, friend, I believe. Who fired that gun?
King. Not I, indeed.
Miller. You lie, I believe.
King. Lie-lie! how strange it seems to me to be talked to
in this style. Upon my word, I don't, Sir.
Miller. Come, come, Sir, confess; you have shot one of the
king's deer, haven't you?
King. No, indeed; I owe the king more respect. I heard
the report of a gun, to be sure, and was afraid some robbers
might have been near.
Miller. I am not bound to believe this, friend. Pray, who
are you? What's your name?
King. Name?
Miller. Name! ay, name. You have a name, haven't you?
Where do you come from? What is your
business here?
King. Theseare questions I have not been used to, honestman.
Miller. May be so; but they are questions no honest man
would be afraid to answer; so, if you can give no better
account of yourself, I shall make bold to take you along with
me, if you please.
King. With you? What authority have you to-
Miller. The king's authority: if I must give you an account.
Sir, I am John Cockle, the miller of Mansfield, one of his
Majesty's keepers in the forest of Sherwood, and I will let no
suspicious fellow pass this way, unless he can give a better
account of himself than you have done, I promise you.
King. Very well, Sir; I am very glad to hear the king has
so good an officer; and, since I find you have his authority, I
will give you a better account of myself, if you will do me the ·
favour to hear it.
Miller. You don't deserve it, I believe; but let me hear what
you can say for yourself,
King. I have the honour to belong to the king as well
as you, and perhaps should be as unwilling to see any
wrong done him. I came down with him to hunt in this
forest, and the chase leading us to-day a great way from home,
I am benighted in this wood, and have lost my way.
Miller. This does not sound well;, if you have been a hunt-
ing, pray where is
your
horse.
King. I have tired my horse, so that he lay down under me,
and I was obliged to leave him.
Miller. If I thought I might believe this, now!
King. I am not accustomed to lie, honest man.
Miller. What, do you live at, court, and not lie! Ha, ha,
ha! That's a likely story, indeed!

King. Be that as it will, I speak truth now, I assure you;
and to convince you of it, if you will attend me to Not-
tingham, or give me a night's lodging in your house, here
is something to pay you for your trouble, and, if that is not
sufficient, I will satisfy you in the morning to your utmost
desire.
Miller. Ay, now I am convinced you are a courtier; here is
a little bribe for to-day, and a large promise for tomorrow,
both in a breath. Here, take it again; John Cockle is no
courtier. He can do what he ought, without a bribe.
King. Thou art a very extraordinary man, I must confess,
and I should be glad, methinks, to be further acquainted
with thee.
Miller. I pray thee, don't thee and thou me, at this rate. I
suppose
I
am as good a man as yourself at least.
King. Sir, I beg pardon.
Miller. Nay, I am not angry, friend; only I don't love to
be too familiar with you, until I am satisfied as to your
honesty.
King. You are right. But what am I to do?
Miller. You may do what you please. You are twelve miles
from Nottingham, and all the way through this thick wood;
but, if you are resolved upon going thither to-night, I will
put you in the road and direct you the best I can; or, if you
will accept of such poor entertainment as a miller can give,
you shall be welcome to stay all night, and in the morning I
will
go
with
you myself. .
King. And cannot you go with me to-night?
Miller. I would not go with you to-night, if you were the
king himself.
King. Then I must go with you, I think.
Courtier. Ah! is your Majesty safe? We have hunted the
forest over to find you.
Miller. How! are you the king? Your Majesty will par-
don the ill usage you have received. [The king draws his
sword.] His Majesty surely will not kill a servant for doing
his duty too faithfully?
King. No, my good fellow. So far from having anything
to pardon, I am much your debtor. I cannot think but so
good and honest a man will make a worthy and honourable
knight. Risė, SIR. JOHN COCKLE, and receive this sword as a
badge of knighthood, and a pledge of my protection; and to
support your nobility, and in some measure requite you for
the pleasure you have done us, a thousand crowns a year shall
be your revenue - Doddridge.

THE COW AND THE ASS.
HARD by a green meadow a stream used to flow, so clear
one might see the white pebbles below; to this cooling stream
the warm cattle would stray, to stand in the shade on a hot
summer's day. A cow, quite oppressed with the heat of the
sun, came here to refresh, as she often had done ; and standing
stock still, leaning over the stream, was musing perhaps, or
perhaps she might dream. But soon a brown ass of respect-
able look, came trotting up also to taste of the brook, and to
nibble a few of the daisies and grass : “How d'ye do?” said
the cow; “How d’ye do?" said the ass. “ Take a seat," cried
the cow, gently waving her hand; "By no means, dear
"
Madam,” said he," while you stand;" then stooping to drink,
with a complaisant bow, “Ma'am, your health," said the ass;
“ Thank you Sir," said the cow. When a few of these
compliments more had been past, they laid themselves down
on the herbage at last; and waiting politely, as gentlemen
must, the ass held his tongue that the cow might speak first.
Then with a deep sigh, she directly began, “ Don't you think,
Mr. Ass, we are injured by man? 'Tis a subject that lies
with a weight on my mind : we certainly are much oppressed
by mankind. Now what is the reason ? I see none at all, that
I always must go when Suke choses to call; whatever I'm
doing, 'tis certainly hard, at once I must go to be milked in
the yard. I've no will of my own, but must do as they please,
and give them my milk to make butter and cheese, I've
;
often a vast mind to knock down the pail, or give Suke a box
on the ear with my tail.” “But, Ma'am;" said the ass “not
presuming to teach—0 dear, I beg pardon,--pray finish your
speech,- I thought you had done, Ma'am, indeed," said the
swain, “ go on, and I'll not interrupt you again.” “Why,
Sir, I was only about to observe, I'm resolved that these
tyrants no longer I ll serve; but leave them for ever to do as
they please, and look somewhere else for their butter and
cheese." Ass waited a moment, to see if she'd done, and then,
“Not presuming to teach,”—he begun—" with submission,
dear Madam, to your better wit, I own I am not quite con-
vinced by it yet. That you're of great service to them is
quite true, but surely they, too, are of service to you ; 'tis
their nice green meadows in which you regale; they feed you
in winter when grass and weeds fail. 'Tis under their shelter
you snugly repose, when, without it, dear Ma'am you perhaps
might be froze; for my own part, I know, I receive much

from man, and for him, in return, I do all that I can." The
cow upon this cast her eyes on the grass, not pleased at thus
being reproved by an ass; yet, thought she, “I'm determined
I'll benefit by't, for I really believe that the fellow is right."
A QUEER SERMON.
BELOVED, let me crave your attention. I am a little man,
come at a short notice, to preach a short sermon, from a short
text, to a thin congregation, in an unworthy pulpit. Beloved,
my text is Malt. I can not divide it into sentences, there
being none; nor into words, there being but one.
I must,
therefore, of necessity, divide it into letters, which I find in
my text to be these four-M ALT. M is Moral. A is
Allegorical. L is Literal. T is Theological. The Moral is,
to teach you rustics good manners; therefore, M—my Masters;
A-All of you;L–Leave off; T-Tippling. The Allegorical
is, when one thing is spoken of and another meant. The
thing spoken of is malt; the thing meant is the spirit of malt,
which you rustics make, M—your Meat, A-your Apparel,
L-your Liberty, and T-your Trust. The Literal is,
according to the letters, M—Much, A-Ale, L-Little,
T-Trust. The Theological is, according to the effects it
works; in some, M-Murder; in others, A-Adultery; in
all, L-Looseness of Life; and in many, T-Treachery. I
shall conclude the subject-- First, by way of exhortation.
M-my Masters, A-All of you, L–Listen, T-to my Text.
Second by way of caution. M—my Masters, A-All of you,
L-Look for, T—the Truth. Third, by way of communi-
cating the truth, which is this : a drunkard is the annoyance
of modesty, the spoil of civility, the destruction of reason, the
robber's agent, the ale-house benefactor, his wife's sorrow, his
children's trouble, his own shame, his neighbour's scoff, a
walking swill-tub, the picture of a beast, the monster of a

he died—and I am now an Orphan Boy! Poor, foolish child !
how pleased was I when news of Nelson's victory came, along
the crowded streets to fly, and see the lighted windows flame!
To force me home my mother sought; she could not bear to
see my joy, for with my father's life 'twas bought—and made
me a poor Orphan Boy! The people's shouts were long and
loud ; my mother shuddering closed her ears; “REJOICE !
REJOICE !” still cried the crowd; my mother answered with her
tears. "Why are you crying thus,” said I, “ while others
laugh and shout with joy?” She kissed me, and, with such a
sigh, she called me her poor Orphan Boy!
• What is an
orphan boy?” I said ; when, suddenly, she gasped for breath,
and her eyes closed—I shrieked for aid, but, ah! her eyes were
closed in-DEATH ! And now they've tolled my mother's
knell, and I'm no more a parent's joy ;-oh Lady! I have
learned too well what 'tis to be an Orphan Boy! Oh were I
by your bounty fed—nay, gentle lady, do not chide-trust me,
I mean to earn my bread; the sailor's orphan boy has pride !
Lady, you weep !

see your happy, happy, Orphan Boy !--Mrs. Opie.
FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE!
WHEN a child, I was scolded for being too late at school;
when a boy, I was cuffed and kicked for being too late at my
work; and when a man, I was turned away for being behind
my time on a particular occasion when my services were
wanted.
My Uncle Jonathan was well to do in the world, and as
his nephews were his nearest relations, we had reason to
expect that his property would come among us. He bad, how-
ever, one peculiarity, which effectually shut his door against
me :-he never was five minutes too late in an appointment
in his life, and thought most contemptuously of those who
I really believe that I was somewhat a favourite with
him until my unfortunate failing justly offended him.
He had occasion to go a journey, and I was directed to be
with him at seven in the morning, to carry his portmanteau
to the coach, Alas ! I was “ five minutes too late," and he
had left the house.
Knowing his peculiarity, I hurried after him, and, run-
ning till I could scarcely stand, arrived at one end of the
were.

a
street just in time to see the coach go off with my uncle at
the other! Dearly did I pay for being " FIVE MINUTES TOO
LATE.”
My uncle did not return for a month, and certainiy shewed
more forbearance toward me than he had ever been known to
do on a similar occasion; for in a letter he stated, that if I
could be punctual, he should wish me to meet him on his
return, to take charge of his portmanteau, and thereby make
some amends for my misconduct. Off I set, but knowing
that coaches frequently arrive a quarter of an hour after their
set time, I thought a minute or two could be of no con-
sequence. The coach, unfortunately, was “horridly exact,"
and once more I was after my time-just “FIVE MINUTES TOO
LATE!”
My Uncle Jonathan never forgave me, fully believing that
I had done it on purpose to get rid of the trouble of carrying
his portmanteau. Years rolled away, and I was not so much
as permitted to enter his door.
Time, however, heals many a sore, and while it ruffles many
a smooth brow, smooths many a ruffled temper. My Uncle
Jonathan so far relented, that, when about to make his will,
he sent me to call upon him exactly at ten o'clock. Deter-
mined to be in time, I set off, allowing myself some minutes
to spare; and, pulling out my watch at the door, found that
for once in my life I had kept my appointment to the second.
The servant, to my surprise, told me that my Uncle Jonathan
had ordered the door to be shut in my face, for being behind
my time! It was then I found out that my watch was too
slow, and that I was exactly “FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE!”
Had I been earlier on that occasion, I might have been
provided for; but now I am a poor man, and a poor man I am
likely to remain. However good may arise from my giving
this short account of my foolish habit, as it may possibly con-
vince some of the value of punctuality, and dispose them to
avoid the manifold evils of being “FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE.”
Few young persons are sensible of the importance of
punctuality, because they are not aware of the value of time.
The habit of punctuality must be acquired early. Be punctual
in the family and school, and you will be a punctual man.

The flame that lit the battle's wreck
Shone round him o'er the dead;
Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
As born to rule the storm;
A creature of heroic blood,
A proud, though childlike form.

Without his father's word;
That father, faint in death below,

ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF A MAD DOG.
Good people all, of every sort,
Give ear unto my song;
And, if you find it wondrous short,
It can not hold you long.
In Islington there was a man
Of whom the world might say,
That still a godly race he ran,-
Whene'er he went to pray.
A kind and gentle heart be had,
To comfort friends and foes ;
The naked every day he clad, -
When he put on his clothes.
And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
And curs of low degree.
This dog and man at first were friends;
But when a pique began,
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went mad, and bit the man.
Around from all the neighbouring streets,
The wondering neighbours ran,
And swore the dog had lost his wits,
To bite so good a man.
The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye;
And while they swore the dog was mad,
They swore the man would die.
But soon a wonder came to light,
That shewed the rogues they lied;
The man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died.—Goldsmith.

the plums, and all that, insists, regularly every year, on Uncle
George coming down into the kitchen, taking off his coat, and
stirring the pudding for half-an-hour or so, which Uncle
George good-humouredly does to the vociferous delight of the
children and servants. The evening concludes with a glorious
game of blindman's-buff, in an early stage of which grandpapa
takes great care to be caught, in order that he may have an
opportunity of displaying his dexterity.
On the following morning, the old couple, with as many of
the children as the pew will hold, go to church in great state:
leaving Aunt George at home dusting decanters and filling
castors, and Uncle George carrying bottles into the dining-
parlour, and calling for cork-screws, and getting into every-
body's way:
When the church-party return to lunch, grandpapa pro-
duces a small sprig of misletoe from his pocket, and tempts
the boys to kiss their little cousins under it—a proceeding
which affords both the boys and the old gentleman unlimited
satisfaction, but which rather outrages grandmamma's ideas
of decorum, until grandpapa says that when he was just
thirteen years and three months old, he kissed grandmamma
under a misletoe too, on which the children clap their hands,
and laugh very heartily, as do Aunt George and Uncle George;
and grandmamma looks pleased, and says, with a benevolent
smile, that grandpapa was an impudent young dog, on which
the children laugh very heartily again, and grandpapa more
heartily than any of them.
Suddenly a hackney-coach is heard to stop, and Uncle
George, who has been looking out of the window, exclaims
“Here's Jane!" on which the children rush to the door, and
helter-skelter down stairs; and Uncle Robert and Aunt Jane,
and the dear little baby, and the nurse, and the whole party,
are ushered up stairs amidst tumultuous shouts of “ Oh, my!"
from the children, and frequently repeated warnings not to
hurt baby from the nurse.
A hesitating double knock at the street-door, heard during
a momentary pause in the conversation, excites a general
inquiry of “Who's that?" and two or three children, who
have been standing at the window, announce in a low voice,
that it's “poor Aunt Margaret." Upon which, Aunt George
leaves the room to welcome the new comer; and grandmamma
draws herself up, rather stiff and stately; for Margaret
married à poor man without ber consent. The air of con-
scious rectitude, and cold forgiveness, which the old lady has
assumed, sits ill upon her; and when the poor girl is led in

by her sister, pale in looks and broken in hope-not from
poverty, for that she could bear, but from the consciousness of
undeserved neglect, and unmerited unkindness—it is easy to
see how much of it is assumed. A momentary pause succeeds;
the girl breaks suddenly from her sister and throws herself,
sobbing, on her mother's neck. The father steps hastily
forward, and takes her husband's hand. Friends crowd round
to offer their hearty congratulations, and happiness and
harmony again prevail.
As to the dinner, it's perfectly delightful- nothing goes
wrong, and everybody is in the very best of spirits, and dis-
posed to please and be pleased. Grandpapa relates a circum-
stantial account of the purchase of the turkey, with a slight
digression relative to the purchase of previous turkeys, on
former Christmas-days, which grandmamma corroborates in
the minutest particular. Uncle George tells stories, and
carves poultry, and takes wine, and jokes with the children
at the side-table, and exhilarates everybody with his
good humour and hospitality; and when, at last, a stout
servant staggers in with a gigantic pudding, with a sprig of
holly in the top, there is such a laughing, and shouting,
and clapping of little chubby hands, and kicking up of fat
dumpy legs, as can only be equalled by the applause with
which the astonishing feat of pouring lighted brandy into
mince-pies, is received by the younger visitors. Then the
dessert and the wine and the fun! Such beautiful
speeches, and such songs, from Aunt Margaret's husband, who
turns out to be such a nice man, and so attentive to grand-
mamma! Even grandpapa not only sings his annual song
with unprecedented vigour, but on being honoured with an
unanimous encore, according to annual custom, actually comes
out with a new one which nobody but grandmamma ever
heard before; and a young scape-grace of a cousin, who has
been in some disgrace with the old people, for certain heinous
sins of omission and commission-neglecting to call, and
persisting in drinking Burton ale—astonishes everybody into
convulsions of laughter by volunteering the most extra-
ordinary comic songs that ever were heard. And thus the
evening passes, in a strain of rational good-will and cheerful-
ness, doing more to awaken the sympathies of every member
of the party in behalf of his neighbour, and to perpetuate
their good feeling during the ensuing year, than half the
treatises that have ever been written, by half the Philosophers
that have ever lived." Boz."

As if some good thing she had found.
The clock was on the stroke of eight,
And still she sat apart,
Now listening close, and laying now
One hand upon her heart;
And toying with her curls and rings,
And doing other girlish things.

At length a step was heard, and then
A ringing at the door ;
“ Five minutes and a-half too soon,"
Said Mrs. Mabel Moore.
Then to her maid,-
“ It is no sin,
Go quick, and say, I AM NOT IN!
“For, if he loves me as he says,
He can afford to wait,
And come again precisely at
Five minutes after eight.
My nerves are really quite unstrung,
So very earnestly he rung."
But true love never did run smooth,
As oftentimes is told
And when the door was opened wide,
And shivering in the cold
The maid beheld the expected guest,
She smiled and curtsied her best,
And told him with a grace as sweet
As if she craved a boon,
Her mistress had declared it was
A little bit too soon;
And that she thought it was no sin
To send him word she was not in.
“Ay, very well,” the guest replied,
" In truth I make no doubt,
That whether she be in or not,
I've surely found her out.”
And she who sent him from the door
Remaineth still Mrs. Mabel Moore.

Are around and above, if thy footing should fail,
If thine eye should grow dim, and thy caution depart,
“Look aloft,” and be firm, and be fearless of heart.

With a smile for each joy, and a tear for each woe,
Should betray thee when sorrows, like clouds, are arrayed,
“ Look aloft” to the friendship which never shall fade.

Should the visions which hope spreads in light to thine eye,
Like the tints of the rainbow, but brighten to fly,
Then turn, and, through tears of repentant regret,
“ Look aloft” to the Sun that is never to set.
Should they who are nearest and dearest thy heart,
Thy friends and companions,-in sorrow depart,
“ Look aloft” from the darkness and dust of the tomb
To that soil where “ affection is ever in bloom."
And, oh! when Death comes in his terrors, to cast
His fears on the future, his pall on the past,
In that moment of darkness, with hope in thy heart,
And a smile in thine eye, “ LOOK ALOFT,” and depart.

THE bark that held a prince went down,
The sweeping waves rolled on;
And what was England's glorious crown
To him that wept a son ?
He lived—for life may long be borne
Ere sorrow break its chain;
Why comes not death to those who mourn?-
He never smiled again !
There stood proud forms around his throne,
The stately and the brave;
But which could fill the place of one,-
That one beneath the wave?
Before him passed the young and fair,
In pleasure's reckless train;
But seas dashed o'er his son's bright hair :-
He never smiled again!
He sat where festal bowls went round,
He heard the minstrels sing;
He saw the tourney's victor crowned
Amidst the knightly ring :
A murmur of the restless deep
Was blent with every strain,
A voice of winds that would not sleep :-
He never smiled again!
Hearts, in that time, closed o'er the trace
Of vows once fondly poured ;
And strangers took the kinsman's place
At many a joyous board ;
Graves, which true love had bathed with tears,
Were left to heaven's bright rain ;
Fresh hopes were born for other years :-
He never smiled again !-Mrs. Hemans.

MY FATHER'S AT THE HELM.
The curling waves with awful roar
A gallant bark assailed,
And pallid fear's distracting power
O'er all on board prevailed;
Save one--the captain's darling child,
Who steadfast viewed the storm;
And, fearless, with composure smiled
At danger's threatening form,
"
6 And fear'st thou not,” a seaman cried,
6 While terrors overwhelm?
Why should I fear?” the boy replied
My father's at the helm.”

Thus when our worldly hopes are reft,
Our earthly comforts gone,
We still have one sure anchor left, -
GOD HELPS, AND HE ALONE.
He to our cries will lend an ear :
He gives our pangs relief;
He turns to smiles each trembling tear
To joy each torturing grief.
Then turn to Him, ʼmid terrors wild,
When sorrows overwhelm,
Rememb’ring, like the fearless child,

TOPSY.
She was one of the blackest of her race, and her round,
shining eyes, glittering like glass beads, moved with quick
and restless glances over everything in the room. Her
mouth, half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new
mas'r's parlour, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth.
Her wooly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which
stuck out in every direction. The expression of her face was
an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was
oddly drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most
doleful gravity and solemnity. She was dressed in a ragged
garment, made of bagging; and stood with her hands demurely
folded before her. Miss Ophelia, turning to St. Clare,
said,
“ Augustine, what can you have brought that thing here
for?"
“For you to educate, to be sure. I thought she was
rather a funny specimen. Here, Topsy,” he added, giving
a whistle, as a man would call the attention of a dog, “ Give
us a song now, and shew us some of your dancing.”
The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked
drollery, and Topsy struck up, in a clear, shrill voice, an odd
negro melody, to which she kept time with her hands and
feet, spinning round, clapping her hands, knocking her knees
together, in a wild, fantastic sort of time, and producing in
her throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish
the native music of her race; finally, turning a somersault or
two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and unearthly
as that of a steam-whistle, she came suddenly down on the
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and an expression of
meekness and solemnity over her face, only broken by the
cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of
St. Clare said,
“ Topsy, this is your new mistress. I'm going to give you
up to her; see, now,

“Yes, mas’r," said Topsy, with a perfect gravity, her
wicked eyes twinkling as she spoke, and her hands devoutly
folded.
“Now, Augustine, what is this for?" said Miss Ophelia.
Why did you bring her here?"
“For you to Educate. Didn't I tell you? You're always
talking about educating. I thought I would make you a
present of a fresh-caught specimen, and let you try your hand

Miss Ophelia carried Topsy to the kitchen regions, but
she soon saw there was nobody that would undertake to over-
see the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival; and so she
was forced to do it herself, with some very ungracious and
reluctant assistance from Jane.
When arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing,
and her hair cropped short, Miss Ophelia, with some satis-
faction, said she looked more Christian-like than formerly,
and in her own mind began to mature some plans for her
instruction.
Sitting down before her, she began to question her.
“ How old are you, Topsy?"
“ Dunno, missus,” said the image, with a grin that shewed
all her teeth.
“ Don't you know how old you are? Did nobody ever tel)
you? Who was your
mother?”
“ Never had none!” said the child, with another grin.
“ Never had any mother? What do you mean? Where
were you born?"
“ Never was born!" persisted Topsy, with another grin,-
never had no father nor mother, nor nothin'. Old Aunt
Sue used to take car on us.”
“ How long have you lived with your master and mistress?"
“ Dunno, missus.'
“ Is it a year, or more, or less?”
“ Dunno, missus."
“Do you know who made you?”
“Nobody, as I knows on," said the child; “I 'spect I
growed. Don't think nobody ever made me."
* Do you know how to sew?” said Miss Ophelia, who
thought she would turn her inquiries to something more
tangible.
" No missus."
“What can you do?—what did you do for your master and
mistress?"
"Fetch water, wash dishes, rub knives, and wait on folks.”
Topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment.
Her talent for every species of drollery, grimace, and
mimicry-for dancing, tumbling, climbing, singing, whistling,
imitating every sound that hit her fancy-seemed inexhaus-
tible. In her play-hours she invariably had every child in
the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with admiration
and wonder.
With a few lessons, she had learned the proprieties of Miss
Ophelia's chamber. Hands could not lay a coverlet smoother,

adjust pillows more accurately, sweep, and dust, and arrange
more perfectly, than Topsy, when she chose—but she didn't
very often choose. If Miss Ophelia was so sanguine as to
suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do
without overlooking, and so go off and busy herself about
something else, Topsy would hold a perfect carnival of con-
fusion for some one or two hours. Instead of making the
bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the pillow-cases,
butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it would be
grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various
directions; she would climb the posts and hang head down-
ward from the tops, flourish the sheets and coverlets all over
the apartment, dress the bolster up in Miss Ophelia's night-
clothes, singing, and whistling, and making grimaces at her.
self in the looking-glass; in short, as Miss Ophelia phrased it,
“raising Cain" generally.
On one occasion, Miss Ophelia found Topsy with her very
best scarlet India shawl wound round her head for a turban,
going on with her rehearsals before the glass in great style-
“ Topsy!” she would say, when at the end of all patience,
“what does make you act so?"
“Dunno, missus—I 'spects 'cause I'se so wicked !"
“I don't know what I should do with you, Topsy."
Oh, missus, you must whip me; my old missus allers
whipped me. Í ån't used to workin' unless I gets whipped.”
Why, Topsy, I don't want to whip you. You can do
well, if
you ’ve a mind to; what is the reason you won't?”
“Oh, missus, I's used to whippin'; I 'spects it's good for
me.”
Miss Ophelia tried the recipe, and Topsy invariably made
a terrible commotion, screaming, groaning, and imploring;
though half an hour afterwards, when roosted on some pro-
jection of the balcony, and surrounded by a flock of “ 'young
uns,” she would express the utmost contempt of the whole
affair.-Mrs. H. B. Stowe.

Beneath the same green tree;

THE GLUTTONOUS DUCK.
A DUCK once had got such a habit of stuffing,
That all the day long she was panting and puffing ;
And, by every creature that did her great crop see,
Was thought to be galloping fast for the dropsy.
One day, after eating a plentiful dinner,-
With full twice as much as there should have been in her,–
Whilst up to the eyes in a gutter a-roking
She was greatly alarmed by the symptoms of choking!

THE GLUTTONOUS DUCK.

a
There was an old fellow much famed for discerning,
A Drake—who had taken a liking for learning;
And high in respect with his feathery friends,
Was called Doctor Drake :- for this doctor she sends.
In a hole in the dunghill was Dr. Drake's shop,
Where he kept a few simples for curing the crop ;-
Small pebbles, and two or three different gravels,
With certain famed plants he had found in his travels.
“Dear Sir," said the duck with a delicate quack,-
Just turning a little way round on her back,
And leaning her head on a stone in the yard ;
“My case, Dr. Drake, is exceedingly hard.
“I feel so distended with wind, and oppressed,-
So squeamish and faint, such a load at my chest :
And day after day, it certainly is hard
To suffer with patience these pains in my gizzard !"
“Give me leave,”—said the Doctor, with medical look,
As her cold flabby paw in his fingers he took ;
“By the feel of your pulse, your complaint, I am thinking,
Must surely be owing to eating and drinking !"
“Oh no, Sir! believe me !” the lady replied,
Quite alarmed for her stomach, as well as her pride ;
I am sure it arises from nothing I eat,
But I rather suspect I got wet in my
feet.
I have only been picking a bit in the gutter,
Where cook had been pouring some cold melted butter,
A slice of green cabbage, some scraps of cold meat-
Just a trifle or two that I thought I could eat.”
66
a
The doctor was then to his business proceeding,
By gentle emetics, a blister, and bleeding-
When, all on a sudden, she rolled on her side,-
Gave a horrible "quack," and a struggle-and died.
Her remains were interred in a neigbouring swamp,
By her friends,-with a great deal of funeral pomp ;
And I've heard this inscription her tombstone was put on-
“Here lies Mrs. Duck, the notorious glutton!”
And all the young ducklings are brought by their friends
To learn the disgrace in which gluttony ends !-Miss Taylor.

quarrel lasted ; till Joanna, half afraid that her empire was in
peril, summoned never failing aid,-summoned tears in copious
torrents,-tears, and sobs, and piteonis sighs : well she knew
the potent practice, the artillery of the eyes. And it chanced
as she imagined : beautiful in grief was she, beautiful to best
advantage, and a tender heart had he. Kneeling at her side
he soothed her,"Dear Joanna ! I was wrong! never more
I'll contradict you,—but, OH, MAKE MY COFFEE STRONG."

THE WELL OF ST. KEYNE.
A WELL there is in the west country, and a clearer one never
was seen ; there is not a wife in the west country, but has
heard of the Well of St. Keyne. An oak and an elm-tree
stand beside, and behind does an ash-tree grow, and a willow
from the bank above droops to the water below.
A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne ; joyfully he
drew nigh, for from cock-crow he had been travelling, and

there was not a cloud in the sky. He drank of the water so
cool and clear, for thirsty and hot was he; and he sat him
the bank, under the willow tree.
There came a man from the neighbouring town, at the Well
to fill his pail ; on the Well-side he rested it, and he bade the
stranger hail.
Now, art thou a bachelor, stranger?" quoth
he; for an' if thou hast a wife, the happiest draught thou
hast drunk this day that ever thou didst in thy life: or has
thy good woman-if one thou hast-ever here in Cornwall
been for, an' if she have, I'll venture my life she has drunk
of the Well of St. Keyne." “ I have left a good woman who
never was here," the stranger he made reply ; “but that my
draught should be better for that, I pray you answer me
why." “St. Keyne," quoth the Cornish man, “ many a time
drank of this crystal Well, and before the angel summoned
her, she laid on the water a spell :—if the husband, of this
gifted Well shall drink before his wife, a happy man hence-
forth is he, for he shall be master for life; but if the wife
should drink of it first,- heaven help the husband then !"-
The stranger stooped to the Well of St. Keyne, and drank of
the water again. “ You drank of the Well, I warrant,
betimes ?" he to the Cornish man said : but the Cornish-man
smiled as the stranger spake, and sheepishly shook his head :
“ I hastened as soon as the wedding was done, and left my

KING FRANCIS was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport;
And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the Court;
The nobles filled the benches round, the ladies by their side,
And’mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom
he sighed;
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show-
Valour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.
Ramped and roared the lions; with horrid laughing jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams- a wind went
with their paws;
With wallowing might and stiffled roar, they rolled on one an-

'Tis evening, all is calm and still, all nature seems at rest,
Each happy child is in its home, each bird is in its nest.
And Mary, dear, and Willie, too, have lisped their evening
prayer;
I saw them at their mother's side, they were a lovely pair.
“Dear mother," little Mary said, when the good-night kiss was
given,
The angels will be near me now, and I shall dream of Heaven.
“For, mother, I have tried to be a very good girl to day;
My teacher called me good in school, and I was kind at play.
“When brother Willie tore my book, a tear came in my eye;
But I was not naughty then, I think, I did not fret nor cry.
“ And father says that when we try all day to do what's right,
The Lord will send the angels kind, to guard us through
the night."

Next morning, to my side I called the little girl, and said,
“Dear Mary, while you slept last night, I stood beside your
bed;
“And ever and anon a smile, upon your face would gleam;
Now, Mary, tell me, if you can, about your happy dream.”
“I thought that we had gone to heaven, myself and Willie
dear;
And all things were so beautiful! far lovelier than here.
“ And children, far more beautiful than any child on earth,
Were sporting there among the flowers, all full of joy and
mirth,
“ The angels, with their looks of love, seemed watching o'er
each child;
And not an angry word was heard, but all seemed kind and
mild.
"The sun shone far more brightly there, than on a summer's
day,
And all seemed good and beautiful, I wished that we could
stay.
“ Dear mother says, if I am good, the Lord will always keep
The angels near me, through the day, and let them guard my
sleep.
“I love to have the angels near, to teach me what is right:
And I think that I shall not forget, my happy dream last
night.

Your youthful mind is like a garden
Where seeds are sown and leaves spring forth;
Cherish none but plants of virtue,
Beauteous, and of sterling worth.
The hand of vice-resist it firmly,
Ere it sow tares among your flowers;
Guard the tender growing virtues,
Through temptation's trying hours.
Angel hands are near, upholding
Labourers fainting in the way,
And their weary footsteps guiding,
Lest they, wandering, go astray.

GINEVRA.
She was an only child-her name Ginevra, the joy, the pride
of an indulgent sire; and in her fifteenth year became a
bride, marrying an only son, Francesco Doria, her playmate
from her birth, and her first love. She was all gentleness,
all gaiety, her pranks the favourite theme of every tongue.
But now the day was come, the day, the hour; now, frowning,
smiling, for the hundredth time, the nurse, that ancient lady,
preached decorum; and in the lustre of her youth, she gave
her hand, with her heart in it, to Francesco. Great was the
joy; but, at the nuptial feast, when all sat down, the bride
was wanting there, nor was she to be found! Her father
cried, “ 'Tis but to make a trial of our love!" and filled his
glass to all; but his hand shook, and soon from guest to
guest the panic spread. 'Twas but that instant she had left
Francesco, laughing, and looking back, and flying still her
ivory tooth imprinted on his finger. But now, alas! she was
not to be found; nor from that hour could any thing be
guessed, but that she was not !
Weary of his life, Francesco flew to Venice, and forthwith
flung it away in battle with the Turk. Orsini lived; and
long mightst thou have seen an old man wandering as in
quest of something, something he could not' find-he knew
not what. When he was gone, the house remained awhile
silent and tenantless, then went to strangers.
Full fifty years were past, and all forgot; when, on an idle
day,-a day of search 'mid the old lumber in the gallery,
that mouldering chest was noticed; and 'twas said by one as
young, as thoughtless as Ginevra, “ Why not remove it from
its lurking-place?” 'Twas done as soon as said; but, on the
way, it burst, it fell; and lo! a skeleton, with here and there
a pearl, an emerald-stone, a golden clasp, clasping a shred of
gold! All else had perished-save a nuptial ring, and a
small seal, her mother's legacy, engraven with a name, the
name of both—“ GINEVRA." THERE THEN HAD SHE FOUND A
GRAVE! Within that chest had she concealed herself, flutter-
ing with joy, the happiest of the happy; when a spring.lock,
that lay in ambush there, fastened her down for ever!

THE COLLIER'S DYING CHILD.

THE cottage was a thatched one, its outside old and mean;
Yet everything within that cot was wondrous neat and clean :
The night was dark and stormy,-the wind was blowing
a
wild ;-
A patient mother sat beside the death-bed of her child,-
A little, worn-out creature-his once bright eyes grown dim:
It was a Collier's only child—they called him “ Little Jim.”

And oh ! to see the briny tears fast flowing down her cheek,
As she offered up a prayer in thought !~she was afraid to
speak,
Lest she might waken one she loved far dearer than her life;
For she had all a mother's heart, that wretched Collier's wife;
With hands uplifted, see, she kneels beside the sufferer's bed,
And prays that God will spare her boy, and take herself
instead:
She gets her answer from the child -soft fall these words
from him-
“Mother ! the angels do so smile, and beckon “Little Jim !"
“I have no pain, dear mother, now; but, oh! I am so dry :
Just moisten poor Jim's lips once more; and, mother, do not
With gentle, trembling haste, she held a tea-cup to his lips-
He smiled to thank her-then he took three little tiny sips.
“ Tell father, when he comes from work, I said 'good-night'
to him;
And, mother, now I'll go to sleep."......Alas ! poor

She saw that he was dying ! The child she loved so dear,

"
The cottage door is opened—the Collier's step is heard ;
The father and the mother meet, but neither speak a word :
He felt that all was over he knew the child was dead !
He took the candle in his hand, and stood beside the bed :
His quivering lip gave token of the grief he'd fain conceal;
* And see, the mother joins him !—the stricken couple kneel;
With hearts bowed down by sorrow, they humbly ask of Him
In heaven, once more that they may meet their own poor
“ Little Jim !"--Farmer.

KING Bruce of Scotland flung himself down in a lonely mood
to think; 'tis true he was monarch, and wore a crown, but
his heart was beginning to sink. For he had been trying to
do a great deed to make his people glad; he had tried and
tried, but couldn't succeed, and so he became quite sad. He
flung himself down in low despair, as grieved as man could
be; and after a while as he pondered there, “I'll give it all
up," said he. Now just at that moment a spider dropped,
with its silken cobweb clue; and the king, in the midst of his
thinking, stopped to see what the spider would do. 'Twas a
long way up to the ceiling dome; and it hung by a rope so
fine that how it would get to its cobweb home King Bruce
could not divine. It soon began to cling and crawl straight
up with strong endeavour,—but down it came, with a slipping
sprawl, as near to the ground as ever. Again it fell and
swung below, but again it quickly mounted; till up and
down, now fast, now slow, nine brave attempts were counted.
“Sure,” cried the king, “ that foolish thing will strive no
more to climb, when it toils so hard to reach and cling, and
tumbles every time." Up again it went, inch by inch, higher
and higher he got: and a bold little run at the very last
pinch, put him into his native spot. “ Bravo, bravo!" the
king cried out, “ all honour to those who try: the spider up
there defied despair; he conquered, and why shouldn't I ?!
Again King Robert roused his soul; and history tells the
tale that he tried once more,—'twas at Bannockburn,-and
that time he did not fail!- Eliza Cook.

To the pure and thoughtful mind,
Whose power for blessing was given to man,
By perfect love designed.
Look at it! Think of it!
Wonderful is the Hand of Man!
Wonderful is the Hand of Man!
Look at it! Think of it!
For all the power of the Artist's soul
Finds expression there;
Painter or Sculptor, line by line
It makes the image fair.
All his love for the beautiful
Becomes thus fixed and sure,
Leaving on marble or canvass, the forms
Through centuries to endure.
And every use by the hand performed
Thus attains its highest state,
Only when done in its outward form
Be its mission little or great.
Look at it! Think of it!

Angels' eyes read the history there
Of the life of the inmost soul,
For in each work all our love and thought
Reign with supreme control.
And up to its secret springs is traced,
From the outward act, the cause
By which alone it could have its birth
From the soul's unchanging laws.
Never a deed' by the hand is done
But the record upon it is kept,
Never a moment the register
At his post forgetful slept.
Look at it! Think of it!

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
HOME for the holidays-here we go!
Bless me! the train is exceedingly slow!
We have two long hours to travel, you say T!
Come, Mr. Engineer, gallop away!
“Two hours more !" why, the sun will be down
Before we reach home, in our dear native town!
And then, what a number of fathers, and mothers,
And uncles, and aunts, and sisters, and brothers,
Will be waiting to meet us !--Oh! do make haste,
For I'm sure, Mr. Guard, we have no time to waste !
Thank goodness! we sha'n't have to study and stammer
Over Latin, and sums, and that nasty French Grammar;
Lectures, and classes, and lessons are done,
And now we'll have nothing but frolic and fun!
Home for the holidays -off we go!
But this Fast Train is really exceedingly slow!
What sport we shall have when Christmas comes,
When “snap-dragon ” burns our fingers and thumbs
We'll hang mistletoe o'er our dear little cousins,
And pull them beneath it, and kiss them by dozens:
We'll crown the plum pudding with bunches of bay,
And roast all the chesnuts that come in our way :
And when “ Twelfth Night” falls, we'll have such a cake
That, as we stand round it, the table shall quake.
We'll draw " King and Queen,” and be happy together,
And dance old “Sir Roger," with hearts like a feather.
Home for the holidays !—here we go!
But this Fast Train is really exceedingly slow!
Yet, stay: I declare there's our own house at last !
The park is right over the tunnel just past.
Huzza! huzza ! I can see my papa !
I can see George's uncle and Edward's mamma!
And, Fred, there's your brother ! look ! look ! there he stands !
They see us--they see us! they ’re waving their hands!
Why don't the train stop? what are they about?
Now, now, it is steady-oh, pray, let us out!
A cheer for the school, boys! a kiss for mamma!
WE'RE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ! HIP, HIP, HUZZA!

“ WITH BRAINS, SIR."
“PRAY, Mr. Opie, may I ask what you mix your colours
with?" said a brisk dilettante student to the great painter.
“With brains, sir," was the gruff reply-and the right one.
Many other artists, when asked such a question, would have
set about detailing the mechanical composition of such and
such colours, in such and such porportions, rubbed so and so;
or, perhaps they would have shewn him how they laid them
on. Opie preferred going to the quick and the heart of the
matter: With brains, sir.”
Sir Joshua Reynolds was taken by a friend to see a picture.
He was anxious to admire it, and he looked it over with a
keen and careful eye. “ Capital composition; correct draw-
ing; the colour and tone excellent; but-but-it wants-it
wants that!” snapping his fingers; and, wanting “that,”
though it had everything else, it was worth nothing.
Etty was appointed teacher of the students of the Royal
Academy. A student came up to the new master, “ how
should I do this, Sir?” “Suppose you try.” Another, “what
”
“
does this mean, Mr. Etty ?"**"Suppose you look.” But I
have looked.” Suppose you look again.” And they did
try, and they did look, and looked again; and they saw and
achieved what they never could have done, had the "how" or
the "what” been told them, or done for them. In the one
case, sight and action were immediate, exact, intense, and
secure; in the other, mediate, feeble, and lost as soon as
gained. Seeing is the passive state, and at best only registers;
looking is a voluntary act: it is the man within coming to
the window.
So, young friends, bring BRAINS to your work, and mix
everything with them, and them with everything. Let "tools,
and a man to use them,” be your motto. Stir up, direct, and
give free scope to Sir Joshua's “THAT,” and try again, and
look at everything for yourselves.—John Brown, M.D.
THE HEART'S CHARITY.
A RICH man walk'd abroad one day
And a poor man walk'd the selfsame way:
When a pale and starving face came by
With a pallid lip and a hopeless eye:

And that starving face presumed to stand
And ask for bread from the Rich man's hand;
But the Rich man sullenly look'd askance,
With a gathering frown and a doubtful glance.
“I have nothing," said he,“ to give to you,
Nor any
such rogue
of a canting crew..
Get work, get work! I know full well
The whining lies that beggars can tell."
And he fasten’d his pocket, and on he went,
With his soul untouch'd, and his Wisdom content.
Now this great owner of golden store
Had built a church not long before;
As noble a fane as man could raise;
And the world had given him thanks and praise;
And all who beheld it, lavish'd fame
On his Christian gift and godly name.
The Poor man pass'd-and the white lips dared
To ask of him if a mite could be spared.
The Poor man gaz'd on the beggar's cheek;
And saw what the white lips could not speak.
He stood for a moment, but not to pause
On the truth of the tale, or the parish laws;
He was seeking to give—though it was but small,
For a penny, a single penny, was all:
But he gave it with a kindly word;
While the warmest pulse in his breast was stirr'd.
'Twas a tiny seed his Charity shed,
But the white lips got a taste of bread;
And the beggar's blessing hallow'd the crust,
That came like a spring in the desert dust.

The Rich man and the Poor man died,
As all of us must,--and they both were tried
At the sacred Judgment-seat above,
For their thoughts of evil, and deeds of love.
The balance of Justice there was true;
Fairly bestowing what fairly was due;
And the two fresh-comers through Heaven's gate
Stood there to learn their eternal fate.
The recording angels told of things
That fitted them both with kindred wings;
But as they stood in the crystal light,
The plumes of the Rich man grew
less bright.
The angels knew by that shadowy sign,
That the poor man's work had been most divine;

And they brought the unerring scales to see
Where the Rich man's falling-off could be.
Full many deeds did the angels weigh
But the balance kept an even sway;
And at last the church endowment laid
With its thousands promised, and thousands paid
With the thanks of prelates by its side,
In the stately words of pious pride;
And it weigh'd so much, that the angels stood
To see how the Poor man could balance such good:
When a cherub came and took his place
By the empty scale, with radiant grace;
And he dropp'd the penny that had fed
White starving lips with a crust of bread.
The church endowment went up with the beam,
And the whisper of the Great Supreme,
As he beckon'd the Poor man to his throne,
Was heard in this immortal tone-
“ Blessed are they who from great gain
Give thousands with a reasoning brain,
But holier still shall be his part
Who gives one coin with pitying heart!"--Eliza Coom.
THE SOLDIER'S RETURN.
Oh, what an hour was that! when from the main
I reach'd my native village once again!
A glorious harvest fill'd my eager sight,
Half shocked, half waving, in a field of light;
On that poor cottage roof where I was born,
The sun look'd down, as in life's early morn.
I gaz'd around, but not a soul appeared !
I listen'd on the threshold-nothing heard !
I call'd my father thrice, but no one came!
It was not fear or grief that shook my frame,
But an o'erpowering sense of peace
and home;
Of toils gone by, perhaps of joys to come.
The door invitingly stood open wide;
I shook my dust, and set my staff aside.
How sweet it was to breathe that cooler air,
And take possession of my father's chair!
Beneath my elbow, on the solid frame,
Appeard the rough initials of my name
Cut forty years before! The same old clock

am,
Eliza Cooz
Struck the same bell, and gave my heart a shock
I never can forget; a short breeze
sprung,
And while a sigh was trembling on my tongue,
Caught the old dangling Almanacks behind,
And up they flew, like banners in the wind;
Then gently, singly, down and down they went,
And told of twenty years that I had spent
Far from my native land.
Through the room ranged the imprisoned humble bee,
And boom'd, and bounced, and struggled to be free;
Dashing against the panes with sullen roar,
That threw their diamond sunlight on the floor-
The floor clean sanded, where my fancy strayed,
O’er undulating waves the broom had made,
Reminding me of those of hideous forms
That met us as we passed the Cape of Storms,
Where high and loud they break, and peace comes never:
They roll and foam, and roll and foam for ever.
But here was peace, that peace which home can yield.
The grasshopper, the partridge in the field,
And striking clock, were all at once become
The substitutes for trumpet, fife, and drum.
While thus I mused, still gazing, gazing still
On beds of moss that spread the window sill,
I deemed no moss my eyes had ever seen
Had been so lovely, brilliant, fresh, and green;
I guess'd some infant hand had placed it there,
And prized its hue, so exquisite and rare!
Feelings on feelings, mingling, doubling, rose;
My heart felt everything but calm repose;
I could not reckon moments, hours, nor years,
But rose at once, and then burst into tears;
Two shadows now I saw, two voices heard,
One bespoke age, and one a child appear'd;
In stepp'd my father with convulsive start,
And in an instant clasp'd me to his heart.
Close by him, stood a little blue-eyed maid,
And stooping to the child, the old man said,
• Come hither, Nancy, kiss me once again,
This is your Uncle Charles, come home from Spain."
The child approach’d, and with her fingers light,
Stroked my old eyes, almost deprived of sight.
But why thus spin my tale, thus tedious be!
Happy old soldier--what's the world to me?

MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY.
MERRY words, merry words, ye come bursting around,
Telling all that Affection can say ;
'Tis the music of heart-chords that dwells in the sound,
“Many happy returns of the day!".
The red cheek of the child is more rich in its glow,
And the bright eye more swift in its ray;
When his mates hail his birth in their holiday mirth,
And drink “ happy returns of the day !"
The old man may smile while he listens, and feels
He hath little time longer to stay ;
Still he liketh to hear from the lips that are dear,
Many happy returns of the day !”
Though Misfortune is nigh, let the kind words float by,
And something of Hope will spring up;
That the hand of the Future may drain off the gall,
And some nectar-drops yet fill our cup.
If we bask in content while another short year
Is recorded with eloquent bliss;
How we prize the fond wishes, all gladly sincere,
That come round with the soul-pledging kiss.
Oh! our place in the world will be chilly and drear,
When our natal-tide passes away
Without one to remember, or breathe in our ear,
“Many happy returns of the day!"
There are moments when Truth and Devotion increase,
Till they burn in the crucible breast;
With an increase and might that we knew not the light
Of our smouldering feeling possess'd;
And that flame will be vividly flashing out thus,
When we welcome returns of the time,
"That gave some loved beings to life and to us;
-The sweet bells in Mortality's chime.
Then a garland--a bumper, a dance, and a feast,
Let the natal-tide come when it may;
Be it autumn or spring, a gay chorus we'll sing,
“Many happy returns of the day!"-Eliza Cook.
