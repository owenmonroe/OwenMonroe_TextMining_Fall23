PREFATORY. 
 
 We offer no apology for this booklet. There are 
 persons who will take exception to it, either in its entirety 
 or in part. But it must be so; for we are not always 
 understood. It has been prepared with the hope that 
 some persons, at least, may be led to take a broader, and 
 so, more comprehensive view of the triple department — 
 Elocution, Expression, Oratory. Criticism of these studies 
 as an educational factor comes from those persons who 
 know nothing of the study, or hold erroneous ideas con- 
 cerning it. This class we humbly ask to lay aside their 
 antipathy and consider the "Argument" and "Is there a 
 place in the educational field " for the study? Those who 
 as yet have formed no definite opinion, we trust it will not 
 be asking too much of them to read all. If the effort put 
 forth will help to lift the study to its rightful place in the 
 great plan of education in our country, we shall be satisfied. 
 I am grateful to the large number of persons who have so 
 kindly encouraged me in my work, who helped to make it 
 known, and to the scholars who examined my work and 
 systems of teaching and pronounced them rational, 
 although they differ much from the so-called u cut and 
 dried " systems, much of which are unreasonable and un- 
 scientific.

"No instrument of man's devising can reach the heart as does 
 that most wonderful Instrument, the human voice. It is God's special 
 gift and endowment to His chosen creatures. Fold it not away in a 
 napkin." 
 
 ARGUMENT. 
 
 It seems almost impertinent to even think of present- 
 ing any reasons why students, and all interested in a liberal 
 education, should study in this realm of work. If this 
 department of educational work had kept pace in develop- 
 ment with most other lines of education ; or even if the 
 study of Expression had kept the place that it once held 
 in the scheme of education, reasons for its study would not 
 now be necessary. After the Dark Ages began to fade 
 away and the revival of learning took place, the progress 
 of the educational plan was unequal and very slow. More 
 rapid strides have been made in the last quarter of a cen- 
 tury than in any previous whole century in the world's 
 history. It used to be advocated, that if one is versed 
 in language nothing else is necessary ; and some of the 
 hoary heads hold to this theory yet. Finally, a little of 
 the study of mathematics and a little of natural science 
 was added. We are now nearing the time when a like 
 proportion of all the arts and sciences constitute the cur- 
 riculum for the liberal education of man. In this curricu- 
 lum Elocution, Expression, Oratory, constituting a single 
 field of study, are surely finding their places. Persons 
 must have a better reason for discarding the study and 
 treating it with contempt than that they are wholly igno- 
 rant of its true value as an educational factor, and that 
 they themselves are wholly without the capabilities of 
 mastering its difficulties. We are speaking of the work 
 outside of the field of imitation (" parrot and monkey 
 business " ) that is advocated by some teachers, who are 
 not and never have been students of the work. We mean 
 those persons who believe the stimma sutnmartim, sum 
 total, is had in being able to recite a few selections in imi- 
 tation of the teacher. This is truly farce. But is this a 
 plausible reason for condemning the real study? We 
 think not. Persons who have studied it from the stand 
 point of a science as the basis, and an art, meaning the 
 application of the science, do not condemn the work. 
 Science ! you echo. Yes, science ; for it is the study and

development of the whole man, and man is a bundle of 
 science. Men and women who have studied in this way 
 do not look on the work, " scorning the base degrees by 
 which they did ascend." We can only cite a few : 
 
 Henry Ward Beecher says : " I owe much of my suc- 
 cess in life to the fact that for thirty years I spent a 
 part of each day in elocutionary practice." Also, " Many 
 an idea has been driven home by an explosive tone.'' 
 Also, " I advocate in its full extent and for every reason of 
 humanity, of patriotism, and of religion, a more thorough 
 culture of oratory." Also, "Oratory should take its place 
 among the highest departments of education." 
 
 John B. Gough says : " Do nothing in imitation of a 
 teacher ; avoid all his mannerisms. But if he shows you 
 underlying principles of speaking, exercises to develop 
 and train your voice, to make you graceful in gesture — 
 practice perseveringly, patiently and critically." Also, 
 u I would advise every aspirant to eloquence to carefully 
 cultivate his voice, to acquire a perfect command of that 
 organ, if possible. By careful, earnest, frequent training, 
 a defective voice may not only be improved, but an aston- 
 ishing mastery gained over it. A naturally harsh voice, 
 which without training would grate upon the ears of others, 
 may be so brought into subjection as to become musical in 
 all its modulations. A power may be gained of uttering 
 clear, prolonged, trumpet tones, or sounds as sweet and 
 penetrating as the echoes lingering about the soul long 
 after their lips have ceased speaking to us ; as some voices 
 will echo on forever." 
 
 William Ewart Gladstone says: "Many a profes- 
 sional man now in obscurity might rise to the highest rank 
 if he were far-seeing enough to train his voice and body, 
 as well as his mind." 
 
 Cicero, after being trained by the orator Crassus, said 
 concerning the training in elocution : " Every passion of 
 the heart has its appropriate look, tone and gesture; and 
 the whole body of man, and his whole countenance, and 
 all the voices he utters, re-echo like the strings of a harp 
 to the touch of every emotion of his soul." 
 
 Bishop Matthew Simpson says: "God has given us 
 organs which need development. There are many reasons 
 why elocution should be to us a matter of great concern. 
 The first, I notice very briefly, is the age in which we live. 
 Christian nations are sending out teachers to the ends of 
 the earth, but as they are to teach, they should be pre- 
 pared to teach not only matter, but manner. Our lan- 
 guage is girdling the globe. From nation to nation it is 
 beginning to pass, and an American finds himself at home 
 almost everywhere on this round earth. We are a nation 
 of speakers." We might add right here that we begin in

infancy. Wendell Phillips used to say: "As soon as 
 the Yankee baby can sit up in his cradle, he calls 
 the nursery to order, and proceeds to address the house." 
 
 Language is the basis, and this we begin in child- 
 hood. 
 
 Rufus Choate says to his son : "I hope that you will 
 from the start cultivate Elocution. The power of speak- 
 ing with grace and energy ; the power of using aright the 
 best words of our noble language is itself a fortune, and a 
 reputation, if it is associated and enriched by knowledge 
 and sense. I would, therefore, give a special attention to 
 all that is required of you in this department. Delibera- 
 tive eloquence, in its highest forms and noblest exertion, 
 is the utterances of men of genius, practiced, earnest and 
 sincere, according to a rule of art.'' 
 
 Emerson says : "A good reader summons the mighty 
 dead from their tombs, and makes them speak to us. Is 
 it not worth the ambition of every generous youth to train 
 and arm his mind with all the resources of knowledge, of 
 method, of grace, and of character, to serve such a con- 
 stituency?'' 
 
 John Quincy Adams says : u Rhetoric can never con- 
 stitute an orator. No human art can be acquired by the 
 mere knowledge of the principles upon which it is founded. 
 But the artist, who understands its principles, will exer- 
 cise his art in the highest perfection. The profoundest 
 study of the writers upon architecture, the most laborious 
 contemplation of its magnificent monuments, will never 
 make a mason. But the mason thoroughly acquainted 
 with the writers, and familiar to the construction of those 
 monuments, will surely be an abler artist than the mere 
 mechanic, ignorant of the mysteries of his trade and even 
 of the names of his tools." 
 
 Dr. William M. Taylor, in The New Princeton Re- 
 view, says : ,4 If we desire to prepare a young man for 
 doing effective service as a speaker, we should take care 
 that while he is yet in this formative stage, and, so to 
 speak, in the gristle, with his habits yet to be acquired, he 
 should be committed to the care of a wise teacher to learn 
 the arts of reasoning and composition ; and, if possible, 
 to that of a still wiser teacher to take lessons in Elocution. 
 [The italics are my own.] Dr. Thomas Guthrie tells us 
 that during his student life in Edinburg he attended Elo- 
 cution classes winter after winter, walking across half the 
 city and more, fair night and foul, and not getting back to 
 his lodging till about half-past ten. There he learned to 
 find out and correct many acquired and more or less awk- 
 ward defects in gesture ; to be, in fact, natural ; ( this is a 
 hard blow to the opposition that this man should learn to 
 be natural. Author)-, to acquire a command over his voice

so as to suit its force and emphasis to sense, and to modu- 
 late it so as to express the feelings, whether of surprise or 
 grief, or indignation or pity. * * * * And everyone 
 who listened to his sermons from the pulpit, or his 
 speeches from the platform, will attest that they lent a 
 charm even to his eloquence." 
 
 A biographer of Whitefield asks this question : " Why 
 did he [Whitefield] produce such an effect on different 
 minds, so different in original endowment and in cultiva- 
 tion ? " The same biographer answers it thus : "Because 
 among other reasons he gave attention, laborious, careful, 
 unwearied attention, to both the composition and the 
 delivery of his discourses. He left nothing to accident 
 that he could regulate by care. Benjamin Franklin has 
 confirmed the observation of Foote and Garrick, that 
 Whitefield's oratory was not perfected until he had deliv- 
 ered a sermon for the fortieth time." What a blow to 
 those who sneer at repetition until a principle is a part of 
 the student's self. If it were politic we could name men 
 on the lecture platform to-day whose eloquence entrance 
 an audience; and these same lecturers will testify that 
 they have delivered their productions upwards of a thou- 
 sand times. 
 
 Lord Macauley says in his life of William Pitt : "He," 
 (Pitt) "had indeed been carefully trained from infancy in 
 the art of managing his voice — a voice naturally clear 
 and deep-toned. His father, whose oratory owed no small 
 part of its effect to that art, had been a most skillful and 
 judicious instructor. At a later period the wits of Brookes' 
 irritated by observing, night after night, how powerfully 
 Pitts' sonorous elocution fascinated the rows of country 
 gentlemen, reproached him with having been ' taught by 
 his dad on a stool.' " 
 
 Demosthenes, who was trained by Satyrus, said : 
 " The requisites for an orator are acting, acting, acting." 
 This declaration requires a little thought. He did not 
 mean that action which consists chiefly of sawing the air 
 and boring the audience, as it not unfrequently occurs, but 
 the use of mind, body and voice. 
 
 But enough; why compile more? Every student of 
 history knows that true advancement in any line is the 
 result of training and study. If training has been an im- 
 portant factor in the lives of these great men, let us con- 
 sider next what is 
 
 Elocution, Expression, Oratory ? 
 
 While these three terms are not synonyms, we wish 
 to treat them as belonging to and forming a part of one 
 great study. Their origin {elocution from e — out, and 
 loquor — speak; expression, ex — out, and premo — press;

oratory, oro — pray) are widely different roots. In a 
 measure they are being applied to the same kind of work. 
 They differ only as they are applied to distinctive fields of 
 the work. 
 
 Elocution is the theory or the investigation in the 
 several sub-divisions, as voice devolopment, voice build- 
 ing, composition, phrasing, emphasis, modulation, melody, 
 enunciation, articulation, climax, cadence, rate, force, 
 stress ; in a word the theory of speech culture. 
 
 Expression is the power, either natural or acquired, 
 which one possesses to do the work embodied in these 
 several sub-divisions. 
 
 Oratory is the grand consummation or bringing into 
 use all the several parts and peculiarities of each division 
 as required to express forcibly the thought, so as to repre- 
 sent a finished whole. The acme of this achievement 
 represents a life work, and the representative is said to be 
 talented ; but talent is in a measure the product of unre- 
 mitting study. The great plan of learning is to inves- 
 tigate, to develop, to apply. Is there any 
 
 Place in the Educational Field 
 
 for this study ? Let us see. The merits and value of 
 anything are best estimated by either what it has done or 
 can do, or both. Expression has been the most influential 
 factor in shaping the history of man. It has lifted him 
 from the depths of barbarism into the enjoyment of the 
 enlightened age ; it has kindled his fiery zeal until he has 
 sacrificed all for the principles oratory has taught ; it has 
 called together and pursuaded armies to march forth to do 
 and to die. Through its seductive influence one man has 
 gathered enough power around him to lay waste a whole 
 country, and carry the palm in triumph to his own people. 
 
 The Great Teacher promulgated the doctrines of 
 Christianity with such power of expression and such burn- 
 ing eloquence that even his enemies feared to take him. 
 He was the greatest orator. Paul gave us his wonderful 
 code of ethics, and his oratory was irresistible. Spartacus 
 used his powerful oratory against Roman slavery, and 
 incited two hundred of his fellow slaves to rebellion ; how- 
 ever, only seventy of the number escaped, and with this 
 handful he went forth, and by the power of his eloquence 
 gathered enough followers to his standard, and for nearly 
 two years he held them together and defied the flower of 
 the Roman army. 
 
 Columbus, through the power of his oratory, enlisted 
 the aid of the Spanish sovereigns, and America was given 
 to the civilized world. By this same expression he quelled 
 the mutiny on board the ships, which, had it triumphed, 
 all would have been lost. 
 


## p. 10 (#14) ##############################################

The Expression of Cicero gave us a code of justice. 
 Demosthenes, by his oration " For the Crown," drove his 
 enemy and the enemy of the freedom of Greece, iEschines, 
 into voluntary exile. Martin Luther threw his invective 
 style into his oratory with such force that the corrupt 
 clergy quailed beneath its crushing blows, and the Reform- 
 ation was the result. John WiclifTe, before him, raised his 
 eloquence against the See of Rome, drove back his en 
 croachments, and started the reformation in England. 
 Lord Derby saved the coercion bill from an ignominious 
 defeat by the genius of his oratory. Pitt and Burke, by 
 their burning eloquence in parliament, championing the 
 cause of the Americans, did much for the freedom of the 
 colonists, so much that the stubborn king consented to 
 their liberation. Wilberforce, when he introduced his bill 
 against slavery in parliament, found he was alone on the 
 subject. At intervals for fifteen years he plead his cause, 
 and his powerful oratory won. His influence spread, and 
 after twenty-nine years more had elapsed the influence of 
 this eloquence won others, and so procured the freedom of 
 the slaves in all the colonies of England. His work had 
 been caught up on this side of the Atlantic. Look at this 
 galaxy, who represent only a part of the long list who 
 talked in freedom's cause : Thomas Jefferson, John Ran- 
 dolph of Roanoake, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, 
 Charles Sumner, Wendel Phillips, Henry Ward Beecher, 
 Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and a hundred others. 
 
 These great orators used their powers for the cause of 
 humanity. The eloquent words of men and women called 
 forth the great army from the peaceful pursuits of life to 
 take up the sword and the musket, and the shock of con- 
 tending armies was heard in our land. When the victo- 
 rious eagles of the North proclaimed that right had tri- 
 umphed, and the shackles which bound the slave and 
 which separated husband and wife, parents and children, 
 had been broken, and the curse driven from our fair land 
 forever, then again did the orator bind the broken cords of 
 friendship and lave the heated brow of the vanquished, 
 until peace, happiness and loyalty again reigned supreme. 
 
 Then there is Huss, the companion of Jerome, Boss- 
 net, Knox, Wesley, Spurgeon, Tillotson, R. B. Sheridan, 
 Hayne, Gibson, Blaine, and hundreds of others. All these 
 men reached their fame through education. Indeed, his- 
 tory proves that " not an eminent orator has lived but is 
 an example of industry, and yet the almost universal feel- 
 ing appears to be that eminence is the result of accident.'' 
 All orators have had at least a liberal education to begin 
 with, and then have been close students all their lives. 
 
 With all the facts before us, certainly no person can 
 say knowingly that there is no place in the scheme of 
 
 10 
 


## p. 11 (#15) ##############################################

education for elocutionary study in all its phases. An 
 orator has never been made yet by mere intellectual train- 
 ing. The body and mind must be trained. This is essen- 
 tial even for a liberal education. Professor Huxley says : 
 " That man has a liberal education who has been so trained 
 in youth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and 
 does with ease and pleasure all the work that as a mechan- 
 ism it is capable of; whose intellect is a clear, cold logic 
 engine, with all its parts of equal strength." The three 
 great divisions of the mind are Intellect, Will, Emotion. 
 To be an orator or great teacher, all these must be trained. 
 The present arrangement of curriculums puts the burden 
 of work on the Intellect, and, as it were, one-third of the stu- 
 dent's power is trained to meet life's battles. The Will 
 chooses, directs, carries out the determination. Indecision 
 is a great misfortune. Develop the Will. 
 
 Emerson says : u Will is the measure of power. To 
 a great genius there must be a great will. Genius is a 
 delicate sensibility to the laws of the world, adding the 
 power to express them again in some new form. He alone 
 is strong and happy who has a will. The rest are herds.'' 
 Surely this is enough reason that we should give more 
 attention to the will. The development of the emotions 
 makes us more sympathetic, enjoy the beautiful, resent 
 wrong. If rightly cultivated it develops soul power, and 
 we commune with both man and God. We grow by doing. 
 If we will develop this trinity of mind we must use them. 
 The practice of the principles which underlie true training 
 in Expression will do this. 
 
 The following outlined course of study will start the 
 student in the right path and form a nucleus about which 
 all his other study will cluster. The course does not con- 
 tain all that a person will need, but it will form the founda- 
 tion upon which to build the superstructure. The student 
 who expects that he will get in his college course all the 
 learning necessary for any vocation will be disappointed. 
 The end of the college course is but commencement. This 
 course of study will not make the finished orator, but it 
 will give him a start up " young ambition's ladder," and 
 this is all that can be said of any course. Success comes 
 after.

This will constitute a course for graduation. Persons 
 who have had the other literary studies, or their equiva- 
 lent, or students taking or having taken a college course, 
 can be graduated by simply taking Theory of Elocution, 
 Voice Culture, Gesture Study, Physical Culture, Vocal 
 Music, Fencing, Indian Club Swinging, Vocal Physiology 
 and Hygiene, and the course of private 1 essions. Students 
 not wishing to graduate can select their own course of 
 work. The following is 
 
 A Synopsis of the Lines of Study. 
 
 Theory: Methods of breathing, for health and tone 
 production; the attack and direction of tone; tone modi- 
 fication ; resonance ; qualities of tone ; intellect ; emotion ; 
 will ; development of throat for volume ; elementary 
 sounds, their modification and classification ; articulation ; 
 phrasing ; central thought word ; accent ; emphasis ; mod- 
 ulation ; melody ; climax ; cadence ; swell ; stress ; force ; 
 rate ; pathos ; humor ; invective ; physical culture, reasons 
 for ; difference between gesture and movement ; princi- 
 ples of gesture ; gesture-speech ; body must be brought 
 under control of the mind or there can be no good ges- 
 ture; gesture and thought ; body must be educated, then 
 the inspiration of the time and place calls forth the gesture ; 
 no fixed place or time for gesture, only must be sugges- 
 tive of the thought ; voice gesture ; movement for the de- 
 velopment of gesture ; movement of eyes ; mouth ; face ; 
 head; fingers; hands; arms; torso; lower limbs; feet; step- 
 ping ; position of head ; hands ; arms ; torso ; feet ; body ; 
 sitting; standing; harmony of position with the classic 
 studies of the great painters and sculptors. The speaker, 
 a picture before his audience ; it is important that he is a 
 pleasing one. Concepts and percepts of the mind in ex- 
 pression. Development of intellect, of will, of emotion. 
 The individual scope of the trinity. Conversation ; dra- 
 matic work. Stage movement, positions. Acoustics to 
 be observed in speaking ; of hall ; acoustic qualities of the 
 body. Kindred studies. 
 
 Voice Culture. — The voice can be developed as well 
 as the mind. This includes voice development ; tone 
 production ; development of power ; endurance, so the 
 voice can be used two, four, six, eight, ten hours daily ; 
 cure of huskiness, hoarseness ; prevention of the same.

a muscular production ; vocal callisthenics ; articulation ; 
 the will in relation to the voice ; adaptation of voice to 
 the subject-matter in hand ; tone of love, hate, the will, 
 tone of explanation, of excitement ; tone moves with the 
 emotions. 
 
 Gesture Study for the expression of thought and feel- 
 ing. " Gesture is magnetic, speech is not so." The sense 
 lies in gesture and inflection, not speech. Gestures take 
 the place of many words. The thought determines the 
 gesture. No positive rules can be laid down for gesture ; 
 gesture by rule is imitation, machine work; man is not a 
 machine for such work. Develop the mind in art to con- 
 ceive beautiful gestures, and then bring the body under 
 control of the mind ; good, beautiful, graceful gesture will 
 be the result, and no rules are needed. 
 
 Exercises for the development of the body for gesture 
 found under the topic of 
 
 Physical Culture. — This consists of movements of feet, 
 legs, arms, head, torso, body, fingers, hands, eyes, eye- 
 brow^ mouth, nostrils, circles, curves, compound curves, 
 straight lines, like and dislike movements, positive and 
 negative action, movements for passion, pathos, wit, 
 humor ; correction of bad positions ; symmetrical develop- 
 ment of body, for health, vigor and endurance. Expan- 
 sion, contraction, laws of development. Physiology and 
 hygiene. 
 
 Fencing for development of eyes, arms, waist mus- 
 cles, steps and stepping, decisive action. 
 
 Indian Clubs for development of arms, circles, curves, 
 shoulders, chest, diaphragm. 
 
 Vocal Music for melody, smoothness, rhythm and 
 resonance. 
 
 Vocal Physiology and Hygiene, a study of the muscles 
 that produce voice to prevent and correct erroneous ideas 
 concerning the voice ; how it is produced, how modified, 
 how sent forth; laws of health concerning narcosis, diet, 
 care of voice before using, after using, preventive and cure 
 of clergymen's 
 
 Sore Throat, Huskiness and Hoarseness. — This is 
 caused by the wrong use of breath and tone production. 
 Several hundred cases have been cured ; and I have never 
 met a case that would not yield to treatment under the law 
 of cause and effect — that is, remove the cause and the effect 
 will leave of itself. Many cases that have baffled the skill 
 of the physician have been successfully cured. The work 
 is absolute. God made the vocal mechanism perfect, and 
 if it goes wrong the fault is in misuse. 
 
 Stammering and Stuttering likewise yield to mental 
 and physical training. I have never had a case of stam- 
 mering or stuttering that could not be cured by my method

of psychical and physical treatment, when the student is 
 faithful in performing his part of the work. The treatment 
 is systematic, thorough, and the results permanent. The 
 time required is from three weeks to three months as an 
 average. It is not necessary for any person who stammers 
 or stutters to go through life with this terrible affliction. 
 There is no medicine, no cutting, no pain. It is a sensible 
 treatment, but can not be accomplished in a week ; there 
 must be time for development. In the 
 
 Private Lessons the application of the principles of 
 the work is made to suit each individual case. No two 
 persons are constituted exactly alike ; no two will utter 
 the same thoughts alike ; each has his own peculiarity, 
 and the effort should be to preserve this peculiarity and 
 not destroy it, but prune away and cultivate the expression 
 so as to rid the person of the objectionable habits. While 
 we are alike in the fundamental, we differ in the particular. 
 The student is trained in principles until they are a part 
 and parcel of himself. He comes to use the work then, 
 just as he comes to use his mathematics, his language 
 study, or his natural science. It is natural for him. He 
 does not imitate as imitation is generally understood. He 
 is a thinking, acting, percipient, telepathic entity. 
 
 For Whom is this Work Intended? — It is certainly 
 of practical use to 
 
 The Minister, who holds the souls of men, as it were, 
 in his palm. Biblical facts are important, but in this age of 
 printing any person can get the facts at home. Every 
 family can now have a Bible. Something more is neces- 
 sary. Biblical truths will not suffice. There must be 
 something to enforce truth. In the great plan, God is the 
 source, the Bible the instrument, Man the power. When 
 God calls a man to preach the gospel, he also calls him to 
 prepare to preach. A knowledge of the Bible and a skillful 
 knowledge of biblical lore are not sufficient. He must 
 have a voice trained for days of endurance, with a pene- 
 tration that will enable him to speak to thousands with 
 such power of earnestness that his most pronounced oppo- 
 sition will shrink before his speech. Mathews says : " The 
 man who can not put fire into his speeches should put his 
 speeches into the fire." His voice must have, too, that 
 tenderness and sweetness when he wishes it, so that all 
 will come to him and the child will claim him as a friend. 
 His voice must be full, not thin ; deep, not shrill ; well 
 modulated, not monotonous ; resonant, not harsh ; sympa- 
 thetic, not repulsive; durable, not feeble. Then, too, he 
 must be skilled in histronic expression, for in this element 
 lies his greatest power. Channing says : " A man was not 
 made to shut up his mind in itself, but to give it voice and 
 to exchange it for other minds. Speech is one of our 
 
 16 
 


## p. 17 (#21) ##############################################

grand distinctions from the brute." Speech is the gift of 
 God, capable of wonderful development. The speaking 
 machine is perfect ; for its perfect use a trained machinist 
 is required, one who has a knowledge of every part and 
 can manipulate its workings at will. God spoke to man- 
 kind through speech, and the world is to be redeemed with 
 it. How slow the redemption with an army of untrained 
 speakers! What general would risk a battle willingly, 
 where his all is at stake, with an army of half-trained 
 soldiers? The great Preacher of Galilee was a perfect, 
 trained orator by the Father. He had a voice that he 
 could speak for hours at a time in the open air, day after 
 day, and to thousands. His gesture was so powerful that 
 his enemies dared not take him while he was talking ; his 
 expression so admirable and perfect that Peter never forgot 
 a single look; his oratory so complete that his enemies 
 declared that " never man spake like this man " (John vn. 
 46). He is the perfect type, the model, and the charm: 
 " Be ye also perfect " as far as lies in your power. " Let 
 your speech be alway with grace'' (Col. iv: 6). 
 
 Next to that of the minister in responsibility and im- 
 portance as a life calling, is 
 
 The Teacher. — Martin Luther said, " If 1 were to leave 
 my office as preacher, I would next choose that of school- 
 master or teacher ; for I know next to preaching this is the 
 greatest, best and most useful vocation, and I am not quite 
 sure which of the two is the better ; for it is hard to reform 
 old sinners, with whom the preacher has to do, while the 
 young tree can be made to bend without breaking." If 
 Luther lived now he would probably say teaching is the 
 greatest, with all due regard to the former. Preparation is 
 as important for the teacher as the minister. Why do 
 some fail as teachers ? Is it because they do not know 
 enough? No. Their licenses have the very best of grades. 
 What is the difficulty? It may be summed up in one 
 ■short sentence. They lack teaching power ; the power to 
 give what they have received, a sort of drawing out pro- 
 cess, expression. Their explanations and illustrations are 
 dry and uninteresting. They lack decision and will 
 power. Students become indifferent. The teacher is de- 
 ficient in development and training in the powers of 
 speech. Study carefully and critically the life of the great 
 Teacher ; learn the secret element of His success ; He is 
 your model. Book knowledge alone never yet made a 
 successful teacher, and never will. We shall always have 
 failures as long as the science and art of expression is neg- 
 lected. To succeed we must develop the trinity, Intellect, 
 Will, Emotion, and then gather, remember, express. A 
 group of graces. 
 


## p. 18 (#22) ##############################################

The Lawyer, too, will find this study of equal advan- 
 tage. Clear, expressive counsel will always please a client. 
 A charming voice, clear articulation, good modulation and 
 melody, with a clear, forcible expression of thought will 
 always win. Of all professional people there are none who 
 must decide more quickly than the lawyer. In his office, 
 in the trial, before the judge or jury he must act quickly. 
 Indecision is fatal. All his power of expression must be 
 used. He needs a voice, strong, flexible, and capable of 
 great fortitude. Addressing the jury, he must at times be 
 intensely dramatic. Study the history and learn a lesson 
 from great characters in this calling. Aeschines, Demos- 
 thenes, Cicero, trained by Crassus, and was pronounced 
 second to no lawyer at the Roman bar, Pitt, O'Connell, 
 Jeffrey, Curran, Henry, Sumner, Clay, Butler, Ingersoll, 
 all were taught and all were students of expression. 
 The power of gesture wins many victories. History 
 records that pleas by the dramatic lawyer before the 
 Areopagus court were not permitted in daylight, only at 
 night. The judges would not trust themselves to the 
 seductive power of expression. The lawyer will find val- 
 uable assistance for his work in the study of expression. 
 
 The Scholar certainly can not afford to be without it. 
 By the investigation and research in expression he will be 
 enabled to see pictures more clearly, and paint them with 
 his words more vividly. The writer must be a constant 
 student of word painting. The reader in turn must be 
 able to comprehend delineation, or he can not interpret 
 understandingly and comprehensively. The scholar will 
 find a mine of good for his work. 
 
 The Lecturer can not succeed well without education 
 of this kind. He has use for all the qualifications of a 
 minister. The popular lecturer depending on the public 
 for his calls, must be able to give the audience the pleas- 
 ure and profit they demand. He must be an artist capable 
 of producing art. His audience gathers full of expec- 
 tancy. If he does not satisfy their anticipations he is 
 judged a failure. The lecturer whose expression is limited 
 or narrow can not hope to please a popular audience. He 
 has a hard task, but not more difficult than 
 
 The Public Reader who must play a double part, that 
 of getting the thought and then expressing the thought. 
 He must do more, he must intensify the thought or he can 
 not hope to electrify the audience. To be a good reader 
 the broadest culture is essential, otherwise the person will 
 be more or less of a bungler. Many persons seem to have 
 the idea that to repeat words is reading ; far from it. Ed- 
 ucation is the first requisite for a good reader. An uned- 
 ucated person can not tread the realm of the educated. 
 Remember the Persian maxim : " A wise man knows an 
 
 18 
 


## p. 19 (#23) ##############################################

ignorant one, because he has been ignorant himself; but 
 the ignorant can not recognize the wise, because he has 
 never been wise." So a person with little or no education 
 can not be an intelligent reader. A well trained reader 
 may find more meaning in a poem to be expressed than 
 the poet had intended or understood. "Poets are born," 
 and coming from the hand of God speak his mysteries 
 and truths, but do not understand. A good reader has a 
 broad, difficult task to perform when he attempts to please 
 all in a popular audience. However, it is possible to read 
 well, and not be able to move the feelings of all in the aud- 
 ience, for it is not what one says that will move the listener, 
 but that in the auditor's;experience which he can call to mind 
 and cluster around the thoughts of the reader. These are 
 the moving elements. So if nothing is suggested by the 
 speaker that will form a nucleus the listener will not be 
 interested. The reader must be broadly trained. Then, 
 too, this work as an accomplishment stands second to 
 none. x\rt, music, painting are all beautiful, but are not 
 in as general use as Expression. A good reader in the 
 home, in society or any where will always find use for his 
 achievement. The study of elocution, expression, oratory 
 is valuable to all. All must speak, all must commune 
 with his fellow-beings, and all have a work to accomplish. 
 The business man or woman, the professional and the 
 laborer will each be benefited. 
 
 The Physician should be thoroughly trained in Ex- 
 pression for his work. If his demeanor is at fault he is 
 resented by his patients. His voice should be sympa- 
 thetic, kind and attractive. His bearing should be such 
 that his very walk w r ould inspire confidence. Unless his 
 patients have confidence in him he can not hope for great 
 success. The psychic element is now attracting much 
 attention in the field of medicine. The ruling element is 
 Faith. Unless the patient has faith in the physician there 
 will be little benefit. The hard, mechanical tone will 
 often break a fever for a moment, because as soon as heard 
 it sends a thrill of despair through the listener. When 
 the physician's visit is dreaded there is something wrong 
 with that silent influence that reaches out and tells upon 
 all with whom we come in contact. Let the physician cul- 
 tivate his voice, develop his body, train his mind to act 
 quickly, and his success will be greater. 
 
 Memory Training. — The benefit to the mind in this 
 work is such that all who have taken it testify to its merits. 
 I have had students in college who were spending two, 
 three and four hours at work, that after they had studied 
 in elocution could accomplish the same amount in one 
 hour. Every student who has undertaken the work has 
 found that he can carry his complete college work and 
 
 19 
 


## p. 20 (#24) ##############################################

take the elocutionary work besides, and get better results. 
 Instead of being obliged to go over a lesson two or three 
 times, and then be in doubt as to whether or not he has it, 
 one going over often suffices. In the study of Expression 
 the retentive powers of the mind are developed. He sees 
 things on the printed page more clearly and readily, and 
 grasps them more quickly. If you doubt this, try it. I 
 can recall to mind persons who stood at the foot of the 
 class, and after taking up the work in Expression soon 
 walked to the head. Twenty minutes ought to get any 
 ordinary ten pages of history, literature or like subject. 
 Try it and be convinced. 
 
 The question is often asked, Is a teacher necessary ? 
 Let us see. In very much of general study an earnest 
 student will not need an instructor. For example : lan- 
 guage, literature, mathematics, science. Elihu Burritt 
 learned fifty-two different languages without a teacher, 
 having attended only a grammar school. Andrew Johnson 
 became quite a scholar and president of the United States, 
 and he never went to school. Benjamin Franklin was a 
 renowned statesman and philosopher, and spent but one 
 year at school. Benjamin West, the foremost painter of 
 his day, " was self-taught.'' James Ferguson, without a 
 teacher, studied astronomy and mechanics, and thus be- 
 came a great scientist. While a teacher in many things 
 may not be absolutely necessary, to have one will be to 
 gain much valuable time. But while in some things we 
 may succeed without a teacher, when it comes to observ- 
 ing oneself, it is most difficult. 
 
 " O wad some power the giftie gie us 
 To see oursels as others see us ! 
 It wad frae monie a blunder free us." — Burns. 
 
 In fact, in some things concerning ourselves we are 
 not competent critics. We can not criticise our own voices 
 because we do not hear them. Neither can a teacher be a 
 competent voice trainer if his ear has not been trained to 
 detect accurately qualities of tone. The tone a student 
 can produce must determine the next step to be taken in 
 his voice culture. As it is in training a voice, so it is in 
 other things concerning ourselves. We need a teacher, 
 and the best we can afford to engage. There is much 
 teaching being done that is unscholarly, unscientific and 
 unskilled. More good is done and more progress made by 
 a student in one-half an hour with good teaching than in 
 one hour and a half with teachers who are unskilled. 
 Well qualified teachers do not require long time for lessons. 
 Long lessons are indicative of bad teaching. In this work 
 a teacher is quite essential.

 county, Ohio, on the Cleveland, Akron and Columbus Railroad, 
 twelve miles north of Columbus. 
 
 Westerville is a pleasant town of about 2,000 inhabitants, con- 
 nected with the capital city by the Columbus Central Electric Rail- 
 way. Its freedom from saloons and other low places of resort makes 
 it an especially desirable place of residence for students. 
 
 EXPENSES. 
 
 The charges made by the University are : matriculation fee, to all 
 in the College and Preparatory Departments, one dollar, and to all in 
 the adjunct departments, twenty-rive cents. 
 
 Boarding. — In the Ladies' Hall, good boarding, comfortable 
 rooms, light, fuel, etc., are all furnished to the ladies at prices ranging 
 from three dollars to three dollars and a quarter a week, according to 
 location of rooms. The University furnishes neither boarding nor 
 lodging for the gentlemen, but they find both in the village and make 
 their own choice of location, subject to the supervision of the Faculty. 
 At private boarding houses in the village, the prices range from two 
 dollars to two dollars and a half per week. 
 
 In clubs, boarding varies in price irom one dollar and sixty-five 
 cents to two dollars and a quarter a week.

 KIND WORDS. 
 
 Prof. Frank S. Fox, A. M., has been with us for nearly two weeks, 
 giving public entertainments, talks and readings before the school, 
 and private instruction to members of the faculty and students. As 
 a teacher of elocution, oratory, etc., he is among the first in his pro- 
 fession ; as a lecturer he is unsurpassed ; as a christian gentleman he 
 is worthy the confidence of all. It is with pleasure that I commend 
 him and his work, and solicit personal reference. 
 
 Rev. Geo. P. Hott, 
 
 Nov. 12, 1895. Principal Shenandoah Institute, Dayton, Va. 
 
 This is to certify that I have had the privilege of seeing Prof. 
 Frank S. Fox in his work as an instructor in reading and elocution. 
 He is master of his subject, lucid in explanation, and inspiring as a 
 teacher. His talks on "Reading and Literature" are gems. As an 
 entertainer he ranks among the best of the day. 
 
 J. A. Shaw an, 
 
 June 2, 1896 Sup't Schools, Columbus, Ohio. 
 
 This is to certify that I am personally acquainted with Mr. Frank 
 S. Fox. and know him to be a young man of good moral character 
 and christian integrity. He possesses a superior ability as an elocu- 
 tionist, and as a teacher of his profession he is fully qualified. Mr. 
 Fox's entertainments are of such a character that church societies 
 may secure his services with perfect propriety. R. C. Ward, 
 
 U. B. Evangelist, Canton, Ohio. 
 
 You did your work exceedingly well. 
 
 Hon. Daniel H. Hastings, 
 
 Governor of Pennsylvania. 
 
 I was troubled with voice breaking during public speaking. 
 Having entirely recovered from the difficulty, much credit is due 
 Prof. F. S. Fox, from whom I received private instruction. I can 
 cheerfully recommeud him as a competent teacher. 
 
 Rev. A. F. Upp, 
 Pastor M. E. Church, Barberton, Ohio. 
 
 To whom it may concern : It gives me pleasure to commend 
 Prof. Frank S. Fox to any person desiring either voice culture or cor- 
 rection of voice defects. In three weeks' time he lowered my voice 
 from one-half to two-thirds of an octave. His methods are systematic, 
 patient and winning, and sure success follows if the patient does his 
 part faithfully. In the six weeks we spent together he rid my vocal 
 
 22

organs of the dryness to which they were wonted when exercised in 
 addresses. Also, he very much strengthened my voice, both for low 
 and high keys, and corrected my manner of breathing, so that at the 
 close of an hour's address the voice is in better condition than at the 
 beginning. Kindly, L. L. Ford, M. A., 
 
 Principal Manual Training School, Philadelphia, Pa. 
 
 I was troubled seriously with my throat, so much so that it was 
 with difficulty that I could talk, and more especially sing. I doctored 
 for it without relief. I did not know then, as I think now, that it 
 was caused mainly by the improper use of the throat. After taking 
 ten lessons of voice culture under Prof. F. S. Fox's instructions, I 
 can now sing and talk with ease, and what is best of all is that under 
 his directions the more one uses the proper organ the better the de- 
 velopment. I take pleasure in recommending him to the public as 
 an efficient teacher of elocution. Respectfully, 
 
 W. D. Stem, 
 
 Ashland, Ohio. Teacher in High School. 
 
 I take great pleasure in saying that Prof. Frank S. Fox was one 
 of the instructors in Jefferson County (Ohio) Institute of last August, 
 and gave us two evenings' elocutionary entertainments. Professor 
 Fox's lectures in his line in the institute, and his entertainments in 
 the evenings, are regarded by myself and by the teachers present as 
 the most instructive and entertaining we have had for many years. 
 
 J. Buchanan, 
 Twenty years President of Jefferson County (Ohio) Institute. 
 Steubenville, Ohio, Sept, 18, 1894. 
 
 I listened with pleasure to several lessons on reading and elocu- 
 tion by Prof. F. S. Fox, of the Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio, 
 and I am free to say his thoughts, so admirably expressed, were full 
 of instruction to both pupil and teacher. The energy and vigor 
 he exemplifies and his adaptation of voice to the subject matter, en- 
 title Professor Fox to the many words of commendation spoken of 
 him. J. C. Hartzler, 
 
 Sup't of Xewark Schools, Newark, Ohio. 
 
 Prof. F. S. Fox, of Pittsburgh, paid us a brief but pleasant visit. 
 The hand of a master smites the lyre when Professor Fox takes the 
 platform. Sup't J. W. Scott, Loudonville, Ohio. 
 
 The annual commencement address of the South Solon high 
 school was delivered by Prof. Frank S. Fox, of Columbus, Ohio, on 
 May 7th, and on the following evening he gave an elocutionary en- 
 tertainment. On both evenings his work was most satisfactory, 
 holding the closest attention of the large audience until a late hour, 
 and showing the same rare elocutionary ability and magnetism 
 that characterized his work in our teachers' institute last August. 
 Professor Fox is one of Madison county's favorites. 
 
 D. J. Schttrr. 
 
 June -4, 1896. Sup't South Solon Schools. 
 
 Prof. Frank S. Fox lectured at Rio Grande College on "The 
 Mind a Phonograph ; or the Mission of Education." His lecture 
 gave great pleasure and satisfaction. The thought is good and is 
 finely expressed and illustrated. The lecture is very appropriate for 
 schools and educational meetings.
