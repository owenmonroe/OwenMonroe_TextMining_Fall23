PREFACE
To the Second Edition,
THE
He flattering reception accorded to this book has
taken me by surprise, and seems to suggest that
it was not entirely superfluous. It is from the
practical point of view that it makes its appeal to the
particular public to which it is addressed, and nothing
has given me greater satisfaction than the letters of
intelligent appreciation that have reached me from all
ranks of the theatrical profession. The bulk of the book
is simply a practical study of technique, and it is signifi-
cant that the majority of my very generous critics have
agreed in their eulogy of the most strictly technical
sections. The publishers of this, and any succeeding
editions that may be called for, have done me the honour
of suggesting that a short series of articles from my pen
on Lines of Stage Business might prove of interest to
certain readers of The Era; I therefore hope to have the
pleasure of contributing a few ideas to its valuable
columns from time to time during this year. To one and
all of my critics I tender my sincerest thanks for their
kindly reception of this little effort.

PREFATORY NOTE.
IN
N this plea for the study of Elocution the author
desires to express his indebtedness to his earliest
master, John Ryder—a sometime eminent actor,
and no mean elocutionist of the broad, robust, and
intelligible order; W. C. Macready, letters from
whom are still in his possession; Doctors Rush,
Shuldham, and Gordon Holmes; Arthur Burrell,
M.A.; some lectures that appeared in The Study for
1875, and last, but not least, to James L. Ohlson, of
the Birkbeck Institute, the most patient, genial, and
common-sense master he ever met.

ELOCUTION,
A Plea for its Study.
SMITH
MITH, Brown, Jones and Robinson have decided that
Elocution cannot be taught, and Algernon Percival
Aubrey Fitz-Pentonville was heard to declare on a recent
occasion, at his club—“The Precious ”—the membership of
which is confined to literary and critical persons, that Smith,
Brown, Jones and Robinson were right for once, that Elocu-
tion is “all rot.” Now, when the man in the street and the
man in the clouds join hands—that is to say, when common-
sense and uncommon, though “precious,” nonsense
found to be in accord—it is high time for those who believe
otherwise to examine the grounds of their faith.

When the people of Athens had heard Demosthenes speak
against Philip, they rose up and went their ways to find their
weapons, and as they went the sound of their muttering made
a shaking in the air like the sullen shudder of the sea before a
storm, until the lightning of their cry cut through the
thunder-cloud of their wrath : “Let us go and fight Philip !"
When Whitfield spoke to the brutalized, vice-sodden and
submerged men and women of his time, of righteousness,
temperance and judgment to come, he helped us to under-
stand the story of Orpheus and his lute.
When William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was in Parliament,
Macaulay said : “ His figure, when he rose in the House was
graceful and commanding, his features high and noble, his
eyes full of fire.
His splendid voice, when he sank it to a
whisper, was heard to the remotest benches, and when he
raised it to its full volume it rose like the swell of the organ

of a great cathedral, and was heard through the lobbies. His
play of countenance was wonderful, and he could disconcert
an opponent by a single glance of scorn. Every tone, from
the impassioned appeal to the thrilling whisper, was perfectly
at his command."
When Kean played Hamlet, Coleridge said it was like
reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.
When Macready read the Story of Joseph from the Bible
K to some people in New York, there was not a dry eye in the
audience.
When Morley Punshon recited the Lay of Horatius,
Canon Fleming says you saw the bridge fall, heard the
crash, and beheld the yellow foam “splashed to the highest
turret-tops."
And these were all cultivated speakers-orators who had
Clearned their art.
As, however, a prejudice undoubtedly exists in the minds
of Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson, Fitz-Pentonville, and a
multitude of whom they are representative, against a system-
atic, or other study of the art of speech, it may not be out of
place here to consider the more important objections upon
which such prejudice is mainly based.
*
1.
Some people assert that anyone can teach Elocution.
Hence in schools the Reading lesson is put in the hands of
anyone ” who happens to be unemployed-with the usual
result. The answer to this assertion is that if “anyone " can
teach it, it is a wonder that only so few do—for it is a com-
mon and well merited reproach that English men and women
cannot read or speak well. When it is proved that “anyone"
can teach the violin, the organ, or the pianoforte, then it will
be time for us seriously to consider this assertion as to the
teaching of the art of speaking clearly, forcefully and
elegantly.
* A. BURRELL, M.A., “ Teaching and Organization,” Longmans & Co., 1897.

Some people assert that no one can teach it. For this
there is something to be said. The very best reading or
speaking-like the very best acting, painting and music-can-
not be taught, but all the steps that lead to the “ very best"
art can be taught and must be learned. But, fortunately for
“the general," there is much art which is agreeable without
being “the very best." Genius is rare and its productions
necessarily limited, but because one cannot be a great orator
it does not follow that one may not be a clear, forceful and
beautiful conversationist. Genius may be a law unto itself,
but it is not right to pre-suppose genius, nor wise for a
student to look for it; and anything short of genius must
work according to the laws which govern any given art, so
far as these have been ascertained. I do not look for a large
proportion of elocutionary geniuses among you, and I can
imagine some of you saying: “Well, then, if I cannot excel
in Elocution, I don't see the use of wasting time and energy
in its study." But, you see, this is an Art you must practice,
unless you join the Trappists ; the majority of people talk,
some talk a great deal, and because you cannot be a Demos-
thenes or a Sarah Bernhardt, those who love you do not want
you to go dumb all your days. Because there is only one
Shakespeare can we afford to ignore Sheridan and Goldsmith,
Pinero and Hy. Arthur Jones ? Because there is only one
Homer does it follow that we should be richer without Swin-
burne and Shelley, Browning and Tennyson? I do not think
we shall be wasting time by endeavouring to be quite clear
upon this point, because if “no one" can teach Elocution, i.e.
if Elocution cannot be taught, these lectures to which your
attention is invited are simply a waste of time, and your
efforts to follow the instructions therein contained a waste of
energy.
Perhaps it will be as well at this stage to formulate a
working definition of the word Elocution. We understand it
to mean the sum total of all the processes which go to make

up perfectly pure, clear, forcible and beautiful speech,
irrespective of the subject matter. It embraces articulation
and modulation of the speaking voice, the inflection of words,
pause or balance, emphasis, rhythm-especially in relation to
the utterance of poetic language and poetry properly so
called-also gesture, including the subtle and manifold play
of feature and figure, and that art which enables the speaker
to put all processes-mechanical and psychological-so com-
pletely out of sight as to convey an impression of perfect
spontaneity and naturalness.
It will be seen that there is no room in our definition for
arything like “ staginess," no room for stilted formality,
pedantic mouthing, antic gesture, frantic “barnstorming,"
bombast, stiffness, or aught that savours of trick, affecta-
tion or the unnatural. Elocution does not mean, nor should
it be held responsible for the production of these things, any
more than the art of painting means, or should be held
responsible for the vagaries of every faddist in draughtsman-
ship, composition, or colouring, whose affectation of genius
leads him to the employment of the meretricious tricks of the
charlatan.
A very good working definition of an art is knowledge
applied to production. If Elocution conforms to this
definition it may be regarded as an art. Its aim is to apply a
knowledge of vocal mechanism and processes to the produc-
tion of the best order of speech; therefore it is an art, and
as such
may be taught and learned ; and as excellence is not
expected in any other art without much teaching and
unlimited practice, it is unreasonable hastily to seek to make
an exception in the case of Elocution. “Oh, but everybody
must speak.” Granted, and everyone must reason-after a
fashion—but that is not usually regarded as a valid argument
against the study of higher mathematics and logic, the prime
object of which is the training of the reasoning faculties.
The art of Elocution, i.e. speaking and talking, is essen-

tially imitative, its rudiments being actually taught and
learned in childhood. A child's first articulate sounds are the
result of imitation, so is all its subsequent progress in speech.
He learns by repeated efforts and the closest imitation, which
give him an increasing control over the organs of speech, to
express himself as nearly as possible like his models, copying
impartially faults and excellencies. But all these are in the
nature of elocutionary studies and exercises. Why should
these studies and exercises be stopped, and the progress made
in childhood arrested as the subject of them grows towards
manhood or womanhood? Under better instruction and on
better models than childhood has afforded, why should the
child not continue to make progress until higher, or the high-
est proficiency and excellence in speech has been attained ?
There are those who assure us that excellence in speaking
is the result of such multitudinous and complex operations,
governed by laws so subtle and indefinable, that its secret
must for ever baffle the most patient and scientific analyst.
Well, I think it will scarcely be argued that the phenomena of
the most eloquent speech are more complicated than those of
music, yet this objection is not urged against the study of the
latter subject. The music produced by a full orchestra is a
very complex result, yet it admits of analysis to the last
detail, and even of exact notation by means of which it can
be communicated to a musically trained mind and reproduced
at will in precisely the same form, and other things being
equal—e.g. atmospheric and psychological conditions—with
precisely similar effects. Why should it be impossible to
analyse the phenomena attending the most highly wrought
form of speech, and by such analysis to discover so
accurately to describe and note the causes which make the
speech of one man so much better than that of another, so
that the more excellent way may be recognised at sight and
the results reproduced at pleasure ?
And this has been done in many profound and philoso-
as

phical treatises upon the human voice ; monuments of patient
investigation and scientific accuracy. Such writers as Pro-
fessor John Hullah, Dr. Morell Mackenzie, Dr. James Rush,
Dr. Gordon Holmes, John Bishop (Member of the Council of
the Royal College of Surgeons of England), Dr. Shuldham,
Mr. Lennox Browne, and Herr Emil Behnke, have enabled us
by their labours to analyse, describe and classify the faults
and excellencies of Elocution; to explain the shades and
varieties of expression which give certain effects to ordinary
speech and the most consummate eloquence, so that the
qualities of good speech have been reduced to the laws upon
which they depend, and from these ascertained laws rules
have been deduced for purposes of instruction, training and
practice in the art of Elocution, precisely as in the case of
musical notation and exercise.
But just as there were great musicians in the days of old,
before the minute and extended analysis of the elements of
music at present available had been made, so were there
as great orators, and perhaps greater than modern times
can boast; which would seem to suggest that a complete
grasp of theory is not necessary to the teaching or learning
of an art. Indeed, it is an open question whether a very pro-
found analysis, involving an indefinite multiplication of rules
and theories, is of much service, except perhaps to the
teacher of Elocution. To the practical student it is probable
hat the soundest and broadest possible analysis of the
sources and elements of power in speech, enabling him to
cultivate excellences and eschew faults, is all that is of profit.
A too detailed acquaintance with, and a too slavish adherence
to the laws which govern speech may be answerable for the
grave charges brought against the teaching and learning
of Elocution by such men as Archbishop Whately, who says:
“ Probably not a single instance could be found of anyone
who has attained, by the study of any system of instruction
that has hitherto appeared, a really good delivery ; but there

it
are many-probably as many as have fully tried the experi-
ment—who by this means have been totally spoiled ; who
have fallen irrevocably into an affected style of spouting,.
worse in all respects than their original mode of delivery."
When it is asserted that in order to speak well all we have
to do is to speak naturally, undoubtedly the highest possible
attainment in Elocution is characterized by this expression;
but all the facts of experience are ignored by assuming that
"to speak naturally” is just the easiest thing in the world.
It might as well be asserted that in order to become great
painters, vocalists or musicians we have nothing to do but to
paint naturally, or sing naturally, or play on the violin naturally.
This precept so flippantly given leaves out of view all the
difficulties of the art, among which are the following :-
(1) The number and variety of the mental operations which
must be carried on simultaneously in all good speaking are
very great. There are, first, the processes of invention and
style, or of memory, or of reading. For according as we
speak extempore, or memoriter, or from manuscript, we have
either the processes of invention and style, with all the vast
multitude of subordinate operations which these imply; or
those of remembering what we have committed to memory;
or those of taking in from the manuscript through the eye,
the thoughts we have to deliver to others.
Then we
have to keep steadily in view the object that we aim to
accomplish in the minds of the audience. Again, we must
have a perception and feeling of the meaning of each word in
itself and in all its grammatical relations and connections, at
the very moment of speaking it. And further, we must our-
selves be intelligently appreciative of the sentiment. For it is
indispensable to success in oratory that our own hearts should
be capable of feeling all the emotions and passions we
seek to enkindle in the hearts of others; and all the while we
must hold the audience in our mental grasp, in the full and
strong consciousness that we are speaking directly to their

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
minds. All these mental operations, together with a multi-
tude of others, must be carried on simultaneously in all good
speaking. Now it is surely preposterous to assume that this
can be done by anyone without his ever having learned to do
it. (2) Many of these and other mental operations have to be
carried on almost unconsciously and suppressed entirely from
the oral expression. This is the great difficulty that must
be overcome in order to speak well, compared with which all
others are as nothing. All speaking, whether good or bad,
expresses the leading or predominant operations of the
speaker's mind, and if those operations predominate which
properly belong to the giving out or expression of thought,
the speaking can hardly fail to be good ; but if those which
do not properly belong to such expression are predominant,
the speaking will express these, and by so much will prove a
failure. The following examples will illustrate this state-
ment. The operations of memory must be suppressed. In
speaking from memory the whole intellectual process of
remembering what is to be delivered must be kept from
manifesting itself, no sign of it may be allowed to appear in
the vocal expression. The operations of invention and style
must be suppressed. In extempore speaking all these labor-
ious operations have to be carried on for the most part un-
consciously, otherwise the speaking will express them and
little else. The operations of reading must be suppressed. The
case is similar in speaking from manuscript. All the mental
operations of taking in the sense through the eye, which are
in fact the reverse of those that belong to giving it out,
must be carried on unconsciously; for when they become the
leading operations, the speaking will express them and thus
become the reverse of true expression. This is an obstacle
to excellence in speaking which if there were no others
would make instruction, training and practice, indispensable
to its achievement.
The views which have so far been set forth do not require

of
us to ignore or deny the obvious fact that some men without
much previous study or apparent preparation have attained to
excellence as speakers. This is true in relation to every art.
Individuals are found who, without the advantages of a
regular education and with apparently little special training or
practice, excel those who have been highly educated and care-
fully prepared for their special professions. But if the force
of this objection be admitted it must be allowed to weigh
against all study and methodical training in all arts equally.
The axiom is freely conceded that in order to attain to
supreme excellence in any art it is necessary to be born with
a taste and an aptitude for its exercise, and just as any other
art may in exceptional cases be studied, and studied with
success by students without what is generally understood by
outside aid, so a man with a natural gift for speech may
become a superb orator ; but for the average man good
speech is only to be learned from a good speaker, and a good
teacher of Elocution, just as good boxing, good music and
good painting can only be learned from a good boxer, a good
musician and a good painter, and then only when boxer,
musician and painter can teach.
I am amazed to think that intelligent men can be found to
advocate the theory that in the art of speech we should rely
upon our natural gifts alone, when the possession of a bent,
or taste, or aptitude for any other art or craft is regarded as
the strongest reason for its cultivation and training. Does a
boy manifest a strong natural taste for engineering, music,
writing or painting? This is not accepted as a reason why
he should not follow a calling if possible in line with his
natural endowment, but it is always considered as a strong
reason why he should be put to the study and practice of such
a pursuit. He is put to a course of hard study and severe
drill in a particular art or craft, because being naturally
endowed with special aptitudes he is expected by means of
this study and drill to attain to an excellence which it is well

understood he never will without them. Surely the argument
is equally valid in relation to the art of speech.
The possession of unusual natural endowments would be
a sufficient explanation of the great power of speech that
has been attained by some without much previous study or
apparent preparation. Genius gives its possessor conspicuous
advantages over other men, and enables him with compara-
tively little effort or sustained labour to achieve more than
they can by the utmost diligence. It is conceivable that such
men might dispense to some extent with rules and regular
training ; but this is surely no argument against instruction
and training even in such cases, much less in the case of
those not so endowed by nature.
But enquiry will prove that in all ages-even in this most
enlightened, superfine and “precious" present-the so-called
—
natural orators have been distinguished by nothing so much
as the sedulous study, the laborious self-culture, the herculean
labours of self-imposed discipline and well-nigh unlimited
practice, which they have deemed indispensable to compensate
for the deficiencies of their early education, to overcome
defects which they found as natural to them as weeds are to
uncultivated soil generally, and to develope any natural advan-
tages with which they were endowed. Demosthenes, first
orator of Greece, the very Homer among speakers of all
time, who died with the melody of a siren in his tones, was
not overwhelmed at the outset of his career with any con-
sciousness of his extraordinary natural endowments. He is
said to have suffered from a natural weakness of the lungs
and an inarticulate voice, but not from any lack of assiduity
in his efforts to cultivate the art of speech. Cicero, the first
orator of Rome, found the most rigorous study and practice
necessary for the development of such natural powers as were
his. Quintilian, who lived in an age when speech was
regarded in the light of a fine art, says, in his Institutiones,
Oratoriæ : “The most important part of public instruction is

Elocution.” Shakespeare and Burbage; Betterton and
Garrick ; Lord Mansfield and Lord Chatham ; George Whit-
n
field, Patrick Henry and Henry Clay; Lord Chesterfield,
Edmund Burke and William Ewart Gladstone, one and all
bear testimony, either by precept or example and very often
by both, to the truth that excellence in speaking, although it
may appear to be the result of the uncultivated gifts of
nature, may usually be considered as the last result of study
and training
3. But, again, there are those who, while admitting that
speech may be taught, assert that no one really requires to
learn it. It appears to me that if the truth of what has been
already said be not admitted, there is no answer to this
assertion. At the same time, as I do not want to refer to this
subject again, it may be useful briefly to examine some of the
reasons usually put forth for its justification.
The first of these is that the study of Elocution does harm,
that a good speaker is better without it and that it only
makes a bad speaker worse.
The attention of the student
being directed to the manner abstracted from the matter of
the speech or discourse, the natural freedom of speaking is
cramped, the delivery becomes cold, spiritless and artificial ;
affectation, mannerism, awkwardness, "staginess” and every
other vice of speech being the net result of the time and
labour spent in the study of this art.
It may be frankly conceded that there are cases in every
art in which systematic study and instruction appear to have
a bad effect upon the student, and Elocution cannot claim to
be an exception ; but such cases are not more numerous in
this than in any other art, and their rarity makes them so
conspicuous as to give plausibility to the objections drawn
from this source. For whatever may have been Archbishop
Whately's experience some years ago, it is certain that to-
day the poorest speakers are to be found in the ranks of those

our
who have neglected Elocution, and our best-i.e.
pleasantest and most powerful speakers both in public and
private are those cultured men and women who have studied
under efficient teachers until they have become trained and
practised proficients in the art of speech. The fact is that
the faults observed are due to other causes, such as-(1) The
inherent difficuities of the art, which are really first
encountered when the student is put under training, hence
the faults which then appear are charged to the training.
That this is not so is proved by the fact that these faults appear
in nearly every unpractised attempt to speak in public. These
bad habits of speech are not chargeable to the study of Elocution
but to the difficulties inherent in the art of speeeh, and can be
corrected only by training, instruction and practice. (2) An-
other potent cause of faults in speaking is found in false
systems of instruction. This is an evil to which Elocution is
open in common with
other art. There have been faulty
systems of instruction in Elocution, just as there have been in
pianoforte or violin playing, and they have done much mis-
chief. I have heard of, and met teachers whose
elaborated systems of instruction have defeated the end of all
Elocution, which according to our definition includes the
attainment of that art which enables the speaker to put all
processes so completely out of sight as to suggest perfect
spontaneity or naturalness. Any system of instruction that
brands the pupils who follow it with a pronounced mannerism,
whether in Elocution, Music, or any other art, should be
regarded with suspicion. But the existence of vicious
systems of teaching is a fact to be deplored, rather
than an argument against the value of sound instruction, or
for the non-existence of right and helpful methods of training.
(3) Again, these faults are frequently due to the pedantry of
the student. It has been well said that " some men are born
poets, others are born pedants.” Pedantry consists in a
slavish observance of rule, making no allowance for the
every

17
existence of circumstances which may render its application
inadvisable. The pedant never so far forgets himself or his rules
as to use his common sense or trust to his own perception of
the fitness of things. Now, when the pedant studies Elocu-
tion, the rules for the mechanical portion of the art-such as
relate to the management of the breath in speaking, voice
production, articulation and so forth-occupy his mind
-
completely, crowding out all consciousness of his object in
speaking, the subject matter of his speech, and those subtle
mental operations which should accompany the expression of
thought or emotion. He might have had room for these if
he had never bothered his head with the rules which govern
the art of speech, and the scoffer is not slow in calling atten-
tion to the fact and charging the pedant's affectation and
heartlessness of speech upon Elocution and the teachers
thereof. To a person of this order instruction in any
liberal
art must always be a doubtful blessing, for any aptitude he
may possess is wholly mechanical ; but this is hardly an
argument against the utility of the study of Elocution.
Hence it would appear that these faults which have been
regarded as the offspring of Elocutionary studies and teaching
are rather the result of inadequate training, which not only
leaves the natural faults of speech uncorrected, but often
aggravates them.
But this again is a danger which is com-
mon to all other arts. For that which we are not accustomed
to do causes us serious embarrassment when we first attempt
it, the acuteness of which is in direct proportion to our artis-
tic sensibility. A student who has made some advance
unaided by definite instruction in the exercise of any given
art, will find that systematic instruction and study, however
indispensable, will at first retard his progress and probably
throw him so completely off his centre as to mark all his
efforts with eccentricity. A person who has learned to “sing
by ear” is taken in hand by a singing master; he must
“sing by note," and no one is surprised that for some time

he cannot sing as pleasantly as before. Whilst a man is new
to the use of his tools he is clumsy and cannot be expected
to turn out good work. While the rules and methods of an
art are new to the mind it requires a conscious effort to put
them in practice, and so long there cannot be freedom, grace
or power. Which is no more than to say that whilst a child
is learning to read it cannot do justice to Hamlet or Paradise
Lost.
But in the practice of art, which is perceived nature, train-
ing tends to correct faults; and we contend that this is as
true of the art of speech as any other. The most beautiful
bloom and the ripe fruit of an art are brought forth only when
its rules, methods and processes have become inwrought and
sublimated in the very structure of the mind and soul of the
artist, so that the observance and practice of them is uncon-
scious and automatic.
Thus art becomes a second nature, or rather it enables
nature to manifest herself with her original freedom, purity
and power. Evermore it is the achievement of the artist to
enable us to perceive nature. Artificialness is the character-
istic of defective art. And so the person of good natural ear
and voice, who, without training sings pleasantly, but who,
when placed under instruction manifests awkwardness and
constraint, comes forth when the work of the master minds
is perfected to ravish the ear of a listening world and satisfy
the cultured hunger of the critical. And my contention is
that the tendency of systematic, sustained and thorough study
of Elocution is to produce in the student freedom, grace and
power in speech.
But probably the favourite argument employed by those
who assert that though speech may be taught no one really
requires to learn it, is drawn from the natural grace and pro-
priety with which young children express themselves;
certainly nothing has more successfully confused the issue in
question,

Because children speak prettily it has been assumed, I
venture to say in the face of all experience, that they would
continue to do so if only they were left to themselves, and that
all the awkwardness, mannerism, affectation and other faults
which are manifested and developed when they are put under
methodical training, are chargeable to such training. I think
from what has been already said we are now prepared to
appreciate the value of this objection to the study of Elocution.
And first it may be well to enquire how children come to speak
at all. It is assumed that they would continue to speak
admirably if only they were left to themselves. But they
learned to speak in the first instance, and they would not have
done that if they had been left to themselves. They only
learned by instruction, observation, imitation and practice ; in
other words they studied Elocution assiduously and incessantly
during some of the most plastic and receptive years of their
lives, and in consequence attained a certain mastery of the
art of speech.
But do children speak well, in the sense that this objection
requires ? There is certainly a natural grace and charm in
almost everything that children say and do; but this appears
whether they speak correctly or incorrectly. Children try to
speak as they hear others speak, copying without discrimina-
tion or selection. Few of them are so fortunate as to have
perfect models in those with whom they associate. Their
articulation, though pretty, is often feeble and indistinct.
They err in intonation and inflection, and in many other par-
ticulars. They make mistakes in pronunciation and emphasis.
The defects and errors in the speech of childhood are such
that if they were manifested in the conversation of an adult,
or in the utterances of a public speaker, he would hardly be
understood, and certainly would not be listened to.
But being
mistakes peculiar to childhood, from which we do not expect
anything else, and being accompanied by a certain simplicity
and grace, they either pass unnoticed or are regarded as

added beauties. The fact is that the real difficulties of the art
of speech are not grappled with in childhood. With children
speech is simply the vehicle for the expression of the most
direct thoughts, desires, or emotions. This partly accounts
for the ease and grace which characterise the speech of children.
They have not to express any of those subtle, extended and
involved processes of thought peculiar to adult conversation
and public speech. Children do not have to carry on as sub-
processes, so that they shall not appear in the expression, any
laborious operations of invention, style, or memory. They
“ chatter over stony ways, in little sharps and trebles,” and
there is hardly anything in the world so pretty, as the pretty
babbling of pretty children, and oftentimes it is prettiest when
there is least thought or meaning in it ; for children speak right
on, unhampered by thought of thought or solicitude for the
effect produced by the thing they are saying ; and that is why
it is so easy for them to avoid faults which are peculiar to
oratory and common in adult conversation. But, “trailing
clouds of glory” as they come, directly they encounter any
these difficulties, whether in the exercises of the class-room
or in the actual attempt to speak in public-before either a
handful of people or a crowd-immediately these very faults,
which the unthinking have charged upon the study of Elocu-
tion, appear in full force, nor can they in the majority of cases
be corrected otherwise than by systematic instruction and
practice.
In closing my remarks upon the grounds of this objection
I cannot refrain from calling your attention to the fact that
the natural grace of childhood in speech, as in certain other
things, naturally passes away. It is a fact to be deplored,
but we cannot afford to ignore it. The prime causes of that
grace which distinguishes the speech of children indicate, in
their nature, that this grace cannot continue and must be
evanescent. It is the simplicity, the unconscious, fearless
innocence of children, which give the grace and charm to all
of

21
they think, and do, and say, and dream. The development
of self-consciousness appears to be necessary in the scheme of
things, at least it is inevitable, and when the ruthless fingers
of self-consciousness close upon the child-soul to claim it for
its own, more or less of the exquisite bloom that no art can
replace is removed, and as surely as innocence reveals itself
in grace and freedom, self-consciousness manifests itself in
awkwardness and constraint, twin-parents of mannerism,
affectation and a brood of other ugly things—things which
not only rob childhood's speech of its charm, but which make
their baneful influence felt in everything pertaining to the
child's life and conduct. The first real whiff of self-
consciousness and world-consciousness blows away the sur-
face grace and charm of childhood into space, leaving all
swept and garnished for the reception of seven or some other
number of ungraceful habits and inartistic, because unnatural
tricks. This truth is frankly recognised in relation to man-
ners and morals ; these are not left to take care of themselves
when the nursery door closes behind the child, on the
contrary they are put under careful, watchful and continuous
instruction at the hands of highly educated and qualified
teachers. Without such teaching, what would become of the
graceful manners and clean unconscious morals of childhood ?
As little should we expect from it in matters of speech, apart
from that instruction and training which are as indispensable
in the one case as in the other.
The school of thinkers who admit that speech may be
taught but assert that no one really requires to learn it, was
well voiced by a London clergyman who favoured me some
years ago with a lengthy harangue upon the evils resulting
from the study of Elocution, which he concluded by saying :
“And what's the use of it? Look at So-and-so," mentioning
a distinguished clergyman whose magnificent eloquence was
simply in keeping with the rest of the man, “you couldn't
improve him with all your rules, and methods, and voice

productions, and jiggings; and then look at my nephew ! he'll
never get into the House, he's contested two seats already,
unsuccessfully both times, the fellow can't speak and nothing
on earth could make him ; you can't make a silk purse out of
a sow's ear.” Of course the latter proposition being self-
evident was incontestible but I did venture to point out that
the use of a purse being the holding of money, it was not
necessary that it should be made of silk, that indeed I did
not think that purses were made of silk at the present time,
and that I had heard of very good useful purses being made
of pig-skin. But, what is more to the point, I made the
acquaintance of the clergyman my "silk-purse" friend had
-
instanced, and from him I learned that as a young man he
had worked hard at the study of Elocution under the best
masters he could find, that he had followed their teaching,
and for five years had carried their instruction into practice
for at least two hours every day, that even then he continued
it in a modified form, and that to this careful, scientific train-
ing he attributed not only any eloquence he might possess,
but also his entire freedom from fatigue after great vocal
exertion, and his immunity from such complaints as bronchial
colds and “clergyman's sore throat.” My militant friend's
nephew is in Parliament, and he himself has been invalided
for some time with a throat affection which threatens to be
serious, and which an eminent specialist is inclined to regard
as the indirect outcome of a wrong use of the voice.
4. Then there are large numbers of people, including
those who should know better, who if pressed for an opinion
would give a kind of grudging assent to the propositions that
the art of speech can and should be taught, but who would
be prepared stoutly to maintain that the teaching to be use-
ful should not go far, and that all the knowledge of this art
that is good for any man or woman can be learned in a dozen
lessons,

This opinion was not held by the consummate artists of
the golden age of speech. Demosthenes and Cicero thought
no pains too great, no labour too arduous, no discipline too
severe, no expenditure of time excessive when devoted to the
study and practice of this art. Read your Plutarch if you
would learn something of the patience and perseverance of
Demosthenes.
Professor Hullah, in his masterly essay on The Speaking
Voice, contrasting the vocal discipline of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, says :-“To the discipline by which
alone this result—the formation of the voice—is to be
attained, the artists of the golden age of song, the last
century, submitted themselves as a matter of course, during
a period of from three to six years, (witness the well-known
and well authenticated story of Caffarelli, 1703-1783, whose
practice was restricted to a selection of passages written on
one sheet of music-paper, for five out of the six years during
which he was under the instruction of Porpora). Among our
contemporaries this discipline has generally been less severe
and of shorter duration. One advantage, however, it is
certain the former had over the latter : their careers, on the
average, like their apprenticeships, lasted much longer.” This
is our elocution-can-be-learnt-in-a-dozen-lessons friend, at
work in the art of vocal music. “Ah, yes," he says,
“Plutarch, Demosthenes, Cicero and-er--so on; these are
all ancient instances, you really must give us something a bit
more modern and up-to-date." True, my friend, I was for-
getting. Forgetting that we live in the "rapid ” age, the age
in which excellence is achieved by the turn of a wrist and
without taking pains; the age in which a "reputation" can
be made in an hour, a reputation that will scarce hold to-
gether while the showman beats the drum outside and calls
upon the denizens of Vanity Fair to walk up, walk up,” and
examine it for themselves, and the “ corse of which will
scarce hold the laying in” when it passes into the hands of

the sexton appointed to do that which is almost a work of
supererogation; the age of button pressing, switch-turning,
“Impressionism." All the same I remind myself that I have
yet to be introduced to the “Impressionist" who dashed off
in the interval between a bad night's rest and a purple-tinted
debauch-or otherwise and otherwhen produced-a Sistine
Madonna, or even such an angel and archangel-begirt Virgin-
Mother as Fra Lippo Lippi has bequeathed to us. Excellence
in speech is not more easy of attainment than excellence
in boxing or violin playing, and when it can be demonstrated
that twelve lessons of one hour's duration, at weekly intervals,
from any sort of teacher whatsoever, will make a good boxer
or a violinist worthy of the name—then I will begin to consider
the assertion made in relation to the art of speech ; mean-
while I find it difficult to take it seriously.
Professor Plumptre asks, in his celebrated King's
College Lectures on Elocution (p. 24), why it is that an art
like Elocution, which in classical times was so highly valued
and so universally studied, should of late years have been
comparatively disregarded as part of our education and have
fallen from the position it occupied in other days and circum-
stances. And his reply is : “ One reason, I believe, is to be
found in the fact that the very word has been made a bug-
bear of, and has frightened away many excellent persons--
persons of taste and refinement-from the pursuit of its
study, through a completely erroneous interpretation of its
meaning and character. Does not many a man entertain a
sort of secret conviction, even if he does not openly express
the opinion, that the study and practice of Elocution must
eventually lead to a pompous, bombastic, stilted and pedantic
style—a style in short in which the palpably artificial reigns
predominant over everything that is pure, simple and natural?”
And again (page 25): “I have asked, how comes it that the art
of delivery, or Elocution, should have fallen in after-times
into comparative neglect? The art which has revolutionised

was
the world—the art of printing—was then unknown; and when
there no press to scatter far and wide the winged
words of thought, speech was then the only means by which
the intellect of a nation could be stirred or its passions swayed.
Consequently the art of speech was studied by all who wished
to influence their fellow men. Time and circumstance were
alike favourable to its development, and its power was well
understood and sedulously cultivated.
I fancy I have heard it said somewhere that in this
enlightened age of printed matter, books and newspapers,
there is no longer any use for the speaking man-Mr. H. G.
Wells has introduced us to his successor, the Babble Machine
in When the Sleeper Wakes—that men have been eman-
cipated from the charm of the mere talker, perhaps that is
why women form the majority of worshippers at Church ;
that the day of speech is passed. I had a friend who assured
me that the manner of delivery of any given discourse was a
matter of entire indifference to him ; he may have been
peculiar, at all events he often expressed himself amazed that
men could condescend to write poetry when anything could
be so much better expressed in prose. We are assured that
men have learned to distrust the artfully trained orator, the
carefully cultivated speaker who by his tricks of eloquence
could make black appear white and white no colour at all,
and that
with any pretensions to education is
influenced any longer by the shallow arts of delivery. Yes ?

I have been at some pains to consider and answer these
samples of objections to the study of Elocution fully and
fairly, because they are widely held and honestly advanced,
often, it is to be hoped, by people whose knowledge of the
subject is in an inverse ratio to the freedom of their criticisms.
Be this as it may, their influence has been felt and has
materially contributed to the general neglect of a study which
great minds in all ages have regarded as possessing a distinct
educational power. They are very plausible; they have been
and still are urged by respectable thinkers and high
authorities in matters of education, and it must be confessed
they fall in with a certain easy indolence inherent in even
civilized human nature. And so it has come to pass from
these and other causes that systematic study and methodical
training in this art have fallen into neglect and disuse.
For it is a well-known fact that the study of the art of
speech hardly enters as an appreciable element into the pre-
scribed course of a liberal education among English-speaking
peoples. Go to the two great Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge ; your most diligent search will fail to reveal any
adequate machinery for instruction in this art; although these
places abound with men who are directly destined, and even
being prepared for the Bar, the Church and Parliamentary
life, there is no chair of Elocution. These men are going to
enter the already crowded ranks of those who are striving for
the prizes in professions which demand excellence in speech,
and the necessity for instruction in this art is not even recog-
nised. Surely this is an anomaly! But perhaps these men
have studied the subject before coming here to read. Well,
let us see. Where were they educated? “Oh, at Harrow,
“
Eton, Rugby, Winchester, Westminster and such places.'
And what sort of reputation have these institutions for turn-
ing out men who are gifted in their utterance of the mother
tongue? Here is an extract from a lecture delivered in Lon-
don by an old Harrovian, the Reverend Francis Trench, who

is neither a partisan nor a professional teacher of Elocution :
“I must confess I can recall nothing worse than ordinary
school reading and recitation (mark I say ordinary because I
am well aware that there are some exceptions), whether in
the institutions for the rich or for the poor in our land.
Many amongst us can remember very well the method in
which we ourselves said our scholastic lessons in our former
days. Whether any improvement in this method has of late
taken place I am unable to say. I trust that it may be so ;
but at the public School where I myself was, and one, too,
not inferior in repute to any in the land—I mean Harrow-
the utmost attainable speed in recitation was allowed, a false
key and monotonous delivery of the worst kind was never
corrected or rebuked, no attempt whatever was made to
render or to keep the utterance in harmony with the sense ;
and bad habits of delivery were formed and allowed in a
manner almost too strange for belief, and on which I can only
now look back with exceeding surprise. Nor do I conceive
that the system was in the least better at other schools. I
cannot let them escape.
For should the Etonian, the Win-
chester, Rugby or Westminster man, or the representative of
any other public school, ask me what grounds I have for such
a statement, my answer to the challenge would be that at
college I had full means and opportunity to judge from the
reading of the students there. They were gathered from all
schools of distinction, and to anyone hearing them, it was
evident enough that the general delivery at other schools was
by no means superior to that which was allowed and which
prevailed at my own. A system, this, not only most objec-
tionable and most injurious at the time, even to a just
impression of the sense of the passage read, but also so last-
ing in its evil consequences, that many never are emancipated
or escape from them. I say this advisedly, and even those
who do escape often only escape after many years and with
no little difficulty." Mr. Trench goes on to bring an equally

heavy indictment against English private schools of every
class, and calls attention to the fact that even at the time
when he was speaking, so glaring was the evil in our national
schools, that a circular letter had been sent from Her
Majesty's Board of the Privy Council to the various
inspectors of schools, stating that “complaints have been
made to their lordships concerning the very small degree of
attention which reading (as part of Elocution) receives in
elementary schools," and making it imperative to include an
exercise on the art of reading in the oral part of the next
Christmas examination at the training schools.
Here is another indictment from the lips of the late Arch-
bishop of York. His Grace, speaking at King's College,
London, said that in his opinion there was no subject of
more general importance than this (Elocution).
It was
scarcely possible to attend any church or public assembly
of any kind without meeting with instances of defective
articulation, inaudibility, indistinctness of utterance or other
faults in delivery. In place of clear, fluent enuncia-
tion, true expression and feeling, we too often meet with
instances in which the reading and speaking are characterised
by the absence of almost every requisite that should mark a
good delivery. He himself had not seldom heard readings
and speeches in which all the five vowels were so untruly
sounded, that it was really difficult to say which vowel was
the one intended to be uttered. There were also often strong
provincialisms and other faults in the intonation and pronun-
ciation which with care and attention might often be
speedily removed under the instruction of an able and
judicious teacher, but which while they existed were most
unpleasing to persons of refined ear and cultivated taste.
With regard to the teaching of Elocution, his Grace said that
if, as he understood was meant by this, the actual practice in
the art of discussion, of clothing thoughts in clear and fluent
language addressed to others, and so acquiring ease and

expression in delivery, as well as confidence
confidence and self-
possession, it was deserving of every encouragement and met
with his warmest approval ; for few things were more painful
to witness than the nervousness, hesitation and embarrass-
ment of an untrained speaker who had often excellent matter
for a speech but knew not how to deliver it from want of
training and practice.
In other words—the man of liberal education, into the
prescribed course of which the study of the art of speech
had not entered as an appreciable element.
Here is part of a letter culled from an old number of The
English Churchman. “The laity complain, and most justly,
of the bad reading inflicted on them Sunday after Sunday.
But how can it be otherwise while the present system lasts?
Candidates for the ministry have no proper instruction, either
in the public schools or universities. They enter on their
professional duties with provincialisms and cockneyisms
uncorrected, and read positively worse than many of their
congregation."
Listen again, to a professional lamentation from the lips
of Professor Plumptre, who was perhaps the best informed and
most universally respected authority upon Elocutionary matters
in England. “I am aware that during the last ten years the
Elocution of the English language has been much more made
a subject of practice at private schools of repute, for both
sexes, than was formerly the case. But still, at the present
moment, there is no regular professorship founded or endowed
for giving instruction in the art at either of our great univer-
sities.........As far as I know there is nothing of the kind at
the present moment at Eton, at Harrow, at Rugby, at
Winchester, at Westminster, St. Paul's, the Charterhouse, or
Christ's Hospital."
Professor Seeley in his notable essay on English in
Schools, bears a similar testimony. “ The students being
assumed able to read, the first thing is to teach them to read

well. By reading well, I do not mean merely correctly, but
distinctly and expressively. I mean, in short, that they should
be taught Elocution. To this I attach the greatest import-
ance.”
“ It is more than a hundred years since Bishop Berkeley
propounded the question, whether half the learning and
talent of England was not wholly lost because Elocution was
not taught in schools and colleges. The same question might
be repeated now, so slow are we English people in taking a
hint. But it is not for its practical use only that I wish to
see Elocution introduced into education; not so much to
prevent English people from swallowing their words, as they
do now, to the astonishment and dismay of foreigners who
are trying to learn our language; nor yet that those whose
profession or business in after life demands public speaking,
or reading, may be taught to speak and read with effect.
is mainly because I think that by this means, more than any
other, may be evoked in the minds of the young a taste for
poetry and eloquence. This taste is really very universal :
generally, where it appears wanting, it is only dormant; and
it is dormant because no means have ever been taken to
cultivate the sense of rhythm, and to make the delightfulness
of speech understood."
Professor Alexander Bain, one of the soundest thinkers
who has written upon education in modern times, says : “The
art of Elocution and demeanour is one of the refinements of
social life wherein our population is specially backward........
we see on the stage the most consummate examples of manner
and address in various situations......... Elocution and gesture
can be learnt in perfection there and there alone.”
But the severest strictures upon this national defect in
education are those contained in a work * by the Rev. Canon
Fleming, B.D., Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen. “Our

mother-tongue ought to holdin education a pre-eminence which,
hitherto, has certainly been denied it, for it is in that tongue
we have to think, to speak, to write. If we become pleaders,
preachers, or speakers, it must be in English. And yet, of all
branches of study in our public schools, and also in our Univer-
sities, there is none so little fostered as that of cultured reading
and good delivery. In this country, the pulpit, the senate, and
the bar ought, from their position and many advantages, to
be standard authorities; yet many who enter these are so
ill-instructed themselves as to require from those condemned
to listen to them the advice, ' Physician, heal thyself.' Surely,
bad reading and indifferent speaking ought not to prevail in
an era so remarkable for the expansion of intellect, and in a
nation who rely more on the art of oratory than any people of
modern times......... The scarcity of good readers and speakers
cannot be wondered at when we reflect how the cultivation of
these gifts is neglected in English education. At schools in
this country everything is taught but the mother-tongue and
its correct pronunciation. A man is thus left, should circum-
stance throw him into a profession requiring the use of his
voice, to do the best he can in after-life with all the faults and
imperfections with which he finds himself weighted. It is
passing strange that in this country, where, more than in any
other, public speaking is an indispensable requisite, there is
literally no school for its acquisition. Neither at Oxford nor
Cambridge is speaking made a part of education. Men intend-
ing to enter the Church or the Bar are never made to understand
that there is a right and wrong way of speaking. Many, indeed,
imagine that such a study is beneath them. They think that
a man is born an orator, and the power of good and elegant
reading and correct speaking is within any man's reach at his
option. In answer to this, we need only point to the Lords
and Commons for specimens of Parliamentary orators, and to
our churches for clerical reading and preaching......... It is no
more possible for public schools to turn out good classics if

the boys are not well prepared, than to make good readers
and speakers at their speech-days, if boys are not taught the
elements of reading before they enter a public school. Some
of us who attend these speech-days are apt to blame the
particular school for defects. I blame the system of English
education......... While the boy is at school he is taught Greek
and Latin for the imagination and memory ; mathematics for
the mind ; perhaps the modern languages if there is room ;
but it is 'passing strange' that no time in his school-life can
be found to teach him the only language in which he can ever
hope to excel at the Bar, in the Church, in Parliament, or as
an English Gentleman.........Once let our public schools adopt
the thorough study of our own tongue, and assert that there
is no complete education without it, then all other schools will
perforce follow, and the reflex influence on English homes will
soon be felt ; while it will then become the exception, instead
of the rule, that a man shall enter any one of our professions,
or stånd on the floor of the House of Commons, or speak to
his tenants as an English Gentleman, without being able to
deserve and command the attention of his audience.”
American authorities appear to be equally unanimous in
their testimony to the neglect of the study of Elocution, as an
element in the prescribed course of a liberal education.
The Rev. E. Kirk, of Boston, in an able article, On the
Preparation required for the Public Duties of the Ministry,
says: “Many who admire the orator are averse to the process of
discipline which gave him the better style. There is, in other
words, a prejudice in the community, and among many excellent
candidates for the ministry, in regard to Elocution as an art
to be obtained by study and practice. This prejudice is worthy
of a candid examination and an earnest effort to remove it.
In the minds of some, the study and practice of elocution is
connected, if not identified, with the idea of substituting sound
and emotion for sense and truth. To such persons it may be
suggested that there is no necessity for this substitution.

The importance of Elocution presupposes the importance of
other things, and for men who are morally and intellectually
qualified to act as preachers, the importance of effective
delivery and manner can scarcely be overrated. To overlook
it is a proof neither of piety, dignity, nor wisdom. If there
were some ethereal way of communicating with the mind, if
the process of preaching were designed to be mesmeric, and
people were to be put to sleep, instead of being aroused, in
order to instruct and impress them, we might dispense with
Elocution and the culture it requires. But so long as men
are in the body, it will be found requisite for the most effective
exercise of the ministry that a part of clerical education consists
in the study and practice of Elocution.......... In the minds of
others, again, Elocution is identified with an ostentatious
exhibition of the graces and the accomplishments of the
speaker. But this is confounding the use with the abuse of a
good thing. Since it is a man who is to be heard and seen,
and since there is but one right way of speaking or reading
aloud, while there are a thousand wrong ways, the man will do
well to learn the right way. And if the agreeable impression
produced by an agreeable voice, manner and person can
conduce to the right impression of truth, the very purity of
his desire to do good should induce him to cultivate voice,
manner, and person. There is nothing in the study of
Elocution, rightly understood and practised, that need awaken
personal vanity. Nor is there any more inducement for an
eloquent man to display all the means by which he acquired
the power of commanding the sympathies and interest of his
audience, than there is for a learned man to parade all his
learning, or to become a mere pedant. Others fear that they
shall be tempted to turn their chief attention in the pulpit to
tones and gestures, and thus degrade their high vocation.
This, again, is no necessary consequence, and would be simply
a perversion of the art. The greatest orator, in an extempor-
aneous address, pays strict attention to the minutest rules of

a
grammar, but there is no interruption in all this to the concen-
trated action of his understanding ; no extinction to the fiery
current of his feeling.”
Dr. James Rush the eminent physiologist, in his work
On the Human Voice, laments the absence of any teaching
or training in the art of speech, worthy the name, in the schools
and colleges of America. He pictures the miserable exhibition
made by boys of fifteen or sixteen, who are sent on to the
platform without any instruction in Elocution worth mention-
ing, oftentimes without any at all, to perform scenes from
plays and and to recite set speeches. “Now in contrast to
this,” he says,
«« visit a Conservatorio of Music ; see the orderly
;
tasks, the masterly discipline, the unwearied superintendance
and the incessant toil to produce the full beauty and all the
accomplishments of voice; and afterwards do not be surprised
that the Pulpit, the Senate, the Bar, and the Chair of Medical
Professorship are filled with such abominable drawlers,
mouthers, mumblers, clutterers, squeakers, chanters, and
mongers in monotony."
In a series of articles from the pen of an American
divine, published in The Study some few years ago, the
following passages occur : “Systematic study and methodical
training in this art have fallen into neglect and disuse, for, as
already observed, it hardly enters as an appreciable element
into the scheme of a liberal education. The consequences of
this, however, would have been far worse than they are, if it
had not been for the zeal and labours of professed elocutionists,
giving private lessons in our collegiate institutions, but who
often have no regular connection with the faculty. The want
of elocutionary training is especially noticeable in the education
of clergymen, who are instructed to spare no pains in mastering
the nicest theological distinctions, whilst yet they devote
hardly any time or labour to acquiring a good delivery, without
which it is impossible for them to preach with acceptability
or power.

or
Nor is the neglect of this study by the English speaking
peoples to be accounted for on the ground that they possess
superior natural endowments in voice, ear taste.
Professor Hullah makes the following pregnant state-
ments in the opening chapter of his treatise : “It is
generally admitted that the Anglo-Saxon race, now the
majority of the population of Great Britain, are less gifted
vocally—have the vocal apparatus in less perfection, and
artificially in worse order-than any other variety of Indo-
Europeans. As a rule, the English voice, if not always of
inferior quality, is almost always in intensity or capacity
inferior to, for instance, the Italian, the German, or the
Welsh. The number of English speakers who can, without
too evident effort and for any length of time, fill our largest
interiors, or make themselves audible and intelligible at an
open-air meeting, is as small as the number of English
singers who can hold their own against a modern orchestra,
or make their presence felt in every part of the Crystal Palace
transept. This incapacity is, however, of limited importance.
Few speakers are ever called upon to fill our largest interiors,
and addressing an open-air meeting is happily a very excep-
tional duty. What really concerns us all is that, under
ordinary conditions, in
of moderate size, in
presence of very small audiences, nay, in common
versation, no people give expression to their thoughts
-i.e., utter, not choose, their words—so imperfectly and
with such an absence of charm as our countrymen. To the
foreign and unaccustomed ear the English language sounds,
as to the foreign eye the Welsh language looks, made up of
consonants, and these hardly distinguishable from one another.
As a rule, our speech is wanting both in resonance and dis-
tinctness. We reduce to a minimum the sonority of our
vowels, and omit or amalgamate with one another half of our
consonants."

a
Nor can the neglect of this study be excused on the
ground that English is a harsh, rude, unmusical tongue, unfit
for the purposes of the orator. I am tired of hearing our
noble and majestic language charged with all the imbecilities
and slovenly thoughts of those who insult by pretending to
speak it. I am tired of hearing it unfavourably contrasted
with the supple language of Homer and Demosthenes, with
the stately tongue of Virgil and Cicero, with the musical
language in which Dante wrought, with the psychological
subtlety of the tongue of Gæthe. We are told to listen to the
Italian and the Spaniard and the Frenchman if we would
listen to men talking in a language which really lends itself
to speech. We are told that English is insufficiently supplied
with consonants, and that therefore it is weak, and flat, and
flaccid ; that we have no vowels worth naming, and that
therefore it lacks expression, and music, and beauty. It is
not true. It is not the language but the speaker of it who is
feeble, and flat, and flaccid, because he has never learned
precision in the rendering of the consonants nor force in the
employment of the vowels.
As Professor Hullah points out : “Incompetent readers,
slovenly speakers and illiterate singers are of course ready at
all times to shift the responsibility for their shortcomings (in
resonance and distinctness) from themselves to the language
which they habitually disfigure or misrepresent. The tools of
bad workmen are proverbially in fault_blunt, crooked,
cracked, infirm-every way inefficient. A careful and
impartial comparison of modern European languages must
inevitably result in the conviction that in sonority only one
surpasses, and only two or three equal our own. Certain it
is that from the most sonorous of these-the Italian-it is
possible to compress into an intelligible sentence many very
uncouth vocables, especially when he who uses them knows
the value of 'harsh din' as a set off to euphony; while on
the other hand English passages without number might be

37
collected, which for euphony it would be hard to equal, and
impossible to surpass, in any other living tongue.
I take my stand upon the dictum of one of the greatest
philologists the world has ever seen-Jacob Grimm-and
assert that the English language possesses a veritable power
of expression and comprehension unsurpassed by any
language on earth whether ancient or modern. Other
languages may be more musical, more flexible, more limpid,
or more supple, but, with Canon Fleming, I doubt whether
for oratory and poetry there is any language, ancient or
modern, capable of such expression as the English, or any
more copious. “Until a poet comes into the world endowed
with twice the genius of a Shakespeare or Milton, who shall find
our language break in his hands as too feeble a tool to carry
his thoughts, we must feel that our English tongue is far
mightier than anything that has ever been written in it. A
book, however great it may be, embodies but the product of
a single mind, but a language is the heritage of a nation.
And we inherit in our English tongue a possession which will
outstrip the greatest genius that may ever be born, even if he
were a Hercules in intellect.”
If you would learn what your language is capable of as a
vehicle of expression do not be content with what you hear in
Petticoat Lane on Sunday morning, or in Nottingham Market
Place on Sunday afternoon, or on the Stock Exchange any
day of the week ; do not go to a Lancashire operative town
and attempt to form an opinion from the speech of a knot of
mill-hands; do not follow the example of Kingsley's hero
in Yeast of going to a village revel and trying to make
out the meaning of what you hear about you. Kingsley's
passage is so apt that I must quote it : " Sadder and sadder,
Lancelot tried to listen to the conversation of the men around
him. To his astonishment, he hardly understood a word of
it. It was half-articulate, nasal, guttural, made up almost
entirely of vowels, like the speech of savages."

If you would realize the beauty, the pathos, the dignity,
the grace and the power of your language see what has been
done with it by Shakespeare, and Milton, and Addison, and
Macaulay, consider what it was in the hands of Garrick
and Kean, Macready and Phelps, Sheridan and Chatham,
Morley Punshon and Charles Haddon Spurgeon, John Bright
and William Ewart Gladstone, Bellew and Brandram, and you
will be able to appreciate at their true value the shallow criti-
cisms and ill-considered utterances of those who would have
you believe that it is the poverty of our language as a vehicle of
expression that is responsible for the indifferent and unlovely
speech you hear from the lips of English-speaking people.
I affirm that Elocution should be studied because it has
great educating power, as great as any recognised branch of
a liberal education. Indeed, in the development of personal
power it has the advantage, in certain respects, over many
other studies. It calls forth a nobler exercise of the faculties
than the study of science. Science ends in knowing ; but art
applies knowledge to production. Science is simply deter-
minative, art is reative. Art is the crown of science, science
is often but the handmaid of art. Hence the exercise of
a liberal art exerts a stronger influence in the development of
personal power than any merely intellectual pursuit. Then,
the student of Elocution is required to store his memory
with the finest passages of eloquence and poetry ; the
influence of which in the culture of the æsthetic, or other
faculties is incalculable. But in order to give due expression
to such passages he must study them so closely as to catch
the very spirit of their authors. This is a first principle in all
good elocutionary training. The student can make no sound
progress in the art of speech except in the degree in which he
learns to enter into the thought and spirit of the words to
which he is giving utterance. In this way he comes into the
most intimate communion with the great minds of the world
which speak his own tongue; he is “made to drink into their

39
spirit"; he is nourished with their power and grows strong
with their strength.
I affirm that an unanswerable argument for the utility of
this study is found in the example and authority of the great
masters and teachers of eloquence. In modern times it will
be found that the least eloquent and worst speakers in public
and private are those who have not been grounded in the
principles of Elocution, and the most eloquent and best
speakers are those who have been most diligent and thorough
in its study. The ancient teachers took their pupils through
such a protracted and laborious course of exercises and
training in Elocution as appears to us at this day almost
incredible. Demosthenes has become proverbial for the
rigour of his exercises. In order to strengthen his naturally
feeble voice and articulation, he accustomed himself to
declaim with pebbles in his mouth whilst walking rapidly
uphill and on the sea-shore to the sound of the breaking
By these means he developed in the course of the
eight years he devoted to this study that clearness of
articulation and strength of voice which enabled him to
subdue into listening silence those tumultuous assemblies of
the Athenian democracy, the noise and confusion of which
were often like that “ on the lip of the many-sounding sea."
Cicero tells us that after he had begun to speak in public he
found his voice and delivery so inadequate that he gave up
his profession for a time, left Rome, and spent years abroad
in the study of Elocution under the greatest masters of the
art in Greece and Asia Minor. He returned to Rome and
resumed his profession with a voice that became famous for
its sweetness, compass and power, and with a delivery that
charmed the most fastidiously eloquent age in the history of
the world. Such examples are an authority, for these men
must be presumed to have known what they were about-
whether study and training in the art of which they were the
greatest masters were profitable or not.

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
Let us at the outset of our studies “ clear our minds of
cant,” for much nonsense has been talked and written about the
possibility or utility of studying the art of speech—especially
by those knowing least of the subject and those protesting
most loudly against the abuses that have crept into the
teachings of certain masters (vide Canon Fleming's otherwise
admirable treatise). For some time I had the control of
several educational establishments. A certain lady member
of the staff whose business it was to teach the violin and
herself a most capable teacher and exceptional player, for
which she gave the credit entirely to her own teacher, had a
habit of saying at the end of her first lesson to a new pupil :
“This child (or person) has been shockingly taught." The
speech irritated me at first, but after a time I learned to look
upon it simply as a habit, for I noticed that she employed the
same formula in speaking of two pupils who were placed in her
hands during three years, who had, unknown to her, received
the whole of their previous training from her own former
master.
It is only confusing the issue to raise the cry that “ the
matter of a speech is of infinitely more importance than the
manner." It may be, but it is puerile to make comparisons.
It is absurd to argue that because some people are colour-
blind therefore painting cannot be taught and perspective
need not be learned, or that because some people have no ear
or taste for music, therefore Beethoven laboured in vain and
Randegger has wasted his life. It is enough for our purposes
that an exquisite manner renders some assistance to even the
most beautiful matter, and that culture and training can
remedy the more glaring defects of even the worst manner.
To say, as Canon Fleming does, that “one touch of nature is
better than all the studied and mechanical graces of address,”
is only saying that twice two is better than four, or that art is
better than artificialness. “The man who speaks with culture
and ability will always command willing listeners.”

This is an art in which all should aim at excellence, seeing
that all must exercise it, whether in the public utterances of
pulpit, platform, stage and bar, or in the private conversa-
tions of social intercourse. “This man has a genius for
speech.” What an incentive to study! “That man is almost
“
unintelligible and quite uninteresting." So was Demosthenes
until he was seventeen, then he studied and became-
Demosthenes!
In my subsequent lectures I shall have many things to say
to you of a more or less technical nature.
I shall speak very
briefly of the vocal mechanism, first because the subject is
exhaustively treated in many admirable text books, and
second because a knowledge of the mechanism of the voice
however desirable is not absolutely necessary.
I have known
many artists who did not know how pigments were made, or
what were the processes employed in the preparation of char-
coal or the manufacture of black-lead pencils; but not one
who had not studied and practised painting and drawing.
But I shall have much to say upon the cultivation of the
voice, the art of breathing and the general hygiene of the
vocal apparatus. Articulation, Modulation, Inflection, Poise,
Pause, Emphasis ; these “words" should become “things,"
clean-cut, definite and crystalline to us as we travel together.
Of Gesture and the laws that govern the expression of the
Emotions, and of the multitude of other things relating to
public reading, public speaking, and private reading and con-
versation, we shall have much to say to each other.
And above all in importance will be our endeavour to
discover what is the relation of all our teaching, learning,
theorising and practising, to personality in this art. For the
more I study and the longer I teach this subject, the more I
am convinced that all, or nearly all the objectionable manner-
isms affected and cultivated by students of Elocution are not
so much the result of vicious systems of teaching or an innate
tendency to copy the most outstanding features of an admired

model, as a groping and fumbling after some sort of
individuality, which in this as in every other art a man feels
he has a right to expect of himself. The painter goes to the
School of Art; he learns to draw from the flat, from the model,
from the draped figure, from the nude; he studies perspective,
light and shade, composition and colouring. He copies, and
copies, and copies. Early and late he toils, through weary
weeks, and months, and years. He catches the manner of
this “master,” or becomes a follower of such-and-such a
“school," or an enthusiast at the shrine of some “cult” which
seeks to catch a phase of artistic thought or feeling that is
in the air at the moment; but, as surely as he is an artist, he
is all the time groping and stumbling towards his heritage-
himself, his own personality in art; and with whatsoever of cut
and bleeding feet, ragged garments and mutilated limbs he
may arrive, he feels and rejoices that he has at last come into
his own, and here he will find rest, and healing, and freedom.
In these lectures it will not be my aim to impart any
wonderful “secret”—I have none to impart ; to advocate any
elocutionary nostrum ; to advance any astounding, novel or
unique theory; or to establish any overwhelming hypotheses,
but rather to put before you the best results of the patient
observation and labours of specialists ; to assist you to obtain
a comprehensive grasp of the art as a whole; to give you
such a practical analysis of the principal sources of power and
elements of grace in speech as shall enable you to formulate
a few broad rules of general application, by the aid of which
you may learn to steer a just course between the Scylla of
pedantry and the Charybdis of foppery in speech-for as
surely as there is the formal pedant, so is there also the
sensual coxcomb of speech, and probably the most spurious
as well as the most pretentious kind of speaker is the elocu-
tionary fop, the man who would be something more than a
“gentleman "in speech, and is much less.
A few sound general rules are necessary and useful, but,

at the end of all instruction, each man must be his own
teacher, each life inculcate its own lessons and bring forth its
own fruit-individuality, personality. Have your own style
in speech ; cultivated, ennobled, refined, sublimated—but
your own, your very own. Insist upon that. A man's style
in speech, as in everything else, is like a leopard's hide, a part
of him-of him, and of no other living man.
We are
differentiated and individualised. Any method of speech that
fits you is, to you, a good method of speech, or at least you
cannot really change it any more than the leopard can change
his spots.
All you can do towards speaking well is to speak
naturally. But to do anything naturally is the last result of
culture, the final expression of art in you. Every man is born
with certain powers, but not with a command of those
powers. Exquisite music is produced only as the last result
of the severest training and long-continued practice; the
same is true of speech.
And my conclusion is : the worst speaker may be
improved, and the best would be the first to tell you that he
had much to learn.

THE
PREFATORY NOTE.
HE sincere critic belonging to the dear “Old School”
says that “ acting cannot be taught by means of any
book ever written.” Quite so. Neither can painting or
textile manufactures—and the reader will class acting with
the former or latter as he admits the reasoning of Mr. H. B.
Irving, who is an actor, or Mr. E. B. Spence, who is not-
yet text books abound on these subjects, and are not despised
by the young craftsmen to whom they appeal. Mr. Tree's
argument “ that acting cannot be taught, as it is one of the
most inexact of all sciences,” is beside the question. Scientific
knowledge is not necessary to artistic teaching or excellence.
France is a histrionic nation, and the reflection that in France
writers and teachers of dramatic art are read, studied, and
listened to, emboldens the author to hope that this modest
contribution by a humble English craftsman of hints suggested
by the practical difficulties encountered during some years of
work, may appeal to at least a few students of acting among
his countrymen and women. The book is a mere fragment;
but if it is helpful in the slightest degree to those for whom
it was written, it will have realised the most sanguine hopes
of the author, who has no more faith than Mr. Wilson
Barrett in the “hearth-rug taught actor or actress”; but who
at the same time believes with Mr. John Hare that “any-
thing which could be done to assist the beginner to walk
and to talk should be done." The earlier portion of the first
lecture is little more than a free paraphrase of a chapter from
How to Write Fiction, published anonymously by Bellairs &
Co., in 1895 For the rest he is mainly indebted to Dr.
Shuldham, Mr. J. Raymond Solly, and Mr. James L. Ohlson ;
to his own experiences during the past fourteen years of
the stage in most English speaking countries—and some
others, and to every man, woman and child he has met on
the stage, from each of whom he has learned more than he
could ever write. He also desires in this place to acknow-
ledge the great kindness of Mr. Wm. Bailey and his son,
Mr. Wm. Bailey, junr., in placing the stage of the Royal
West London Theatre at his disposal for the training of his
pupils,

men
At the outset of his career the young actor is apt to
imagine that he acts well or ill, feebly or effectively by
nature, and that if one does not strike the note of genius in
the first instance, improvement is much a matter of chance or
the working out of inherent ability in some blind fortuitous
way. That the art of acting is something that can and must
be learned seems not yet to have suggested itself quite
practically to actors or dramatic critics. Yet
like
Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Lewis Waller and Cyril Maude
have studied, practised, and worked hard before they have
dawned upon an appreciative public and slowly-convinced
critics, with the result of a very obvious skill which suggests
the possibility that others also can learn the art.
actor or actress who has gone to an acknowledged master of
acting in order to get instruction knows how little practical
assistance is commonly obtained, and how few of the real
difficulties that are encountered on the threshold of a
theatrical career have been indicated, met and faced.
If we intend something more serious than merely amusing
ourselves or earning a bare living-wage by acting, we shall
find it imperatively necessary to undergo an arduous and
life-long course of study of the art of it. Most successful
actors fumble out this training alone, in the face of many
discouragements and sometimes after years of semi-failure
and heartbreak. Those who have succeeded without entering

upon such serious training have usually attained only a
temporary and fleeting success, a fugitive and evanescent
reputation. Their name is legion, as a glance at the Stage or
the Era will show.
Some sort of apprenticeship is necessary in this as in
every other art, if the beginner hopes to attain solid and
enduring success, although by peculiar personal brilliancy or
idiosyncrasy a fleeting one may be secured. Preferably, this
apprenticeship should be served with some master who can
teach-an important qualification, as it is not every master-
craftsman who is able to impart a knowledge of how to use
the tools of his craft.
For the chief end of acting is the conveying to an audi-
ence an impression of the human emotions, and although
the young are apt at their indulgence the human emotions
are the last things of which a man or woman obtains a
judicial knowledge or anything like a complete control. Do not
confound the simulation or indulgence of emotion with its por-
trayal ; these are to the actor mere tools of his art, good or bad
according to the use he makes of them. It is perfectly possible
either to simulate or indulge an emotion without conveying
an impression of it to an audience. Let me illustrate. During
the run of The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy in London, five
ladies played the part of Mrs. Errol. I shall speak only of
three. One highly accomplished actress felt the part intensely,
it completely “ran away" with her
ran away” with her, and when the curtain
rang down on the first act, with Mrs. Errol holding her
sleeping boy—from whom she is so soon to be parted—in her
lap, the artist was invariably dissolved in tears. Day after
day she wept copiously, indulging the emotion of sorrow at
her anticipated trouble to the full. Net result: red eyes, red
nose, and disarranged make-up. Another lady, credited-
and justly so--with very high intelligence and keen artistic
perception, simulated the emotion in a manner that spoke
volumes for her powers of observation and mimicry. I had it

51
from her own lips : “The part never moved me, and the first
act I felt least of all.” Net result: the burden of the play fell
upon the shoulders of the child. A third representative of
the part neither indulged nor simulated the emotion, but,
breaking off her irresponsible and irrelevant chatter or laying
down her little piece of plain-sewing, she would step quietly
from the wings and produce the picture by allowing the
pathos of the situation to speak for itself. Net result : a
sense of artistic completeness on both sides of the curtain.
I know this is a very vexed question, upon which experts
-and those who are simply critics-differ, and differ without
agreeing to do so. At the same time, without at this point
attempting to formulate a theory or take sides, I can only tell
you what I have observed. The indulgence or simulation of
any given emotion may or may not be an advantage, accord-
ing as it helps or hinders an audience in realising the intent
of an author ; but, until a painter finds it necessary to use
real trees, sky and atmosphere, or "property” trees, sky and
atmosphere in producing a picture of a landscape, I shall
find it difficult to believe that either real or simulated emotion
is necessary to the production of an impression of that
emotion on the mind of an audience.
Anyhow, a young actor when he starts acting has the
whole emotional side of his nature to study and bring into
control, while one who is older has the advantage of a
growing mastery in that direction. Which suggests that in
order to the attainment of excellence it is wise to study and
to some extent master the psychology of the human emotions
and, at least, the more ordinary motives of human action as
interpreted by their outward and visible seemings.
“But,” it may be urged, “great actors and actresses
have not found such a study necessary.” Possibly not
formally, but they have unconsciously studied human nature,
emotions, and the springs of conduct all their lives. They
have not relied solely upon natural inspiration and such hints

as they have gathered by observation and intuition from their
fellow craftsmen. And then remember you are speaking of
.
"great” artists—and the very qualifying adjective postulates
genius. If, then, genius cannot do without this study, by
how much less can such as you and I afford to dispense
with it?
If acting is an art, then, in the nature of the case,
it

an enormous field of study, and every student of dramatic art
must determine for himself how much of the scientific study
of human nature he must do as a groundwork for his essays
in its representation, and should be prepared to welcome any
suggestions as to roads, and ways, and tracks across this
rolling continent that is even less tenacious of footprints than
most artistic territories.
Do not misunderstand me. Scientific knowledge is not
necessary to artistic excellence in acting more than in any
other art, but it is advisable. Consciously or unconsciously
every one of you will acquire some whether you wish to or
not, and the amount will determine your range of possible
artistic creations. If you acquire a very little, you may
create a very few characters and will almost certainly become
known as a
one-part man. How often I have heard it
said—"Oh, it's no use casting So-and-so for that part. Why,
he only plays aristocratic old men, or light comedy juveniles,
or detectives," as the case may be. If you acquire more of
such knowledge as I have suggested your creative scope will
be widened, and if you acquire a great deal you can-like
Coquelin or Tree-create types that differ as widely as
Demetrius and Gringoire. But after you have created one
order of character you must not expect to create another
unless you have acquired a further supply of genuine
material, and you certainly cannot hope to go on creating
types-embodying fresh characteristics--without a corres-
ponding effort expended in collecting fresh supplies of new
living matter, which means an ever-widening knowledge of

human nature. The young actor who proposes to set out
upon the difficult, if fascinating, path of dramatic art, should
take careful account of this fact at the commencement of his
career.
Art has been defined as so many things—from that which
“is quite useless,” almost as luminous as Euclid's definition
of a point, to "a process of moving people's emotions." For
our purposes we may regard it as that which seeks to create
an impression, without reference to the establishment or
otherwise of a theory, and perfect art does this unconsciously
on both sides. The conditions under which you are called
upon to do your work are altogether favourable. Receptivity
is the predominent attitude of those who will watch you, even
including the critics—for the average critic is always better
pleased by the discovery of some earnest intention on your
part than with his usual fate of being bored to extinction by
exhibitions of automatic incompetency. The audience has
paid its money to be entertained by having its emotions
stirred, it does not want you to persuade its understanding,
or convince its judgment; it does not want you to reason
with it or make it theorise about anything at the time, even if
it insists upon theorising afterwards. Your business is to
wake it if it is dormant, or to keep it awake and in good
humour with itself if it does not happen to be asleep. Make
it love, hate, laugh, cry, and you are a successful artist ; in
other words, make it feel an effect, become subject to some
emotion, or honestly do your share of possible work to that
end, and you may go to “ treasury” with a light heart—fail
of this and you should have the uneasy sense of having
obtained money by " false pretences."
For, after all, despite the contentions of pedagogues, the
world is governed by its emotions, not by its intellectual con-
victions, or principles, or conclusions drawn from history or
experience, but by its emotions. That is why religion holds
undisputed sway the world over. Let a wave of patriotic

а
feeling sweep over the nation, and what becomes of its political
differentiations? Let a storm of religious feeling break upon
a community, and where are distinctions of creed? The
world's conduct is governed and determined by its dominant
emotions, the quickening of which it enjoys, hence a favourite
form of entertainment among the civilised is the theatrical.
When you act, your whole business is to play upon the
emotions of those who are paying you to do that and nothing
else. Emotions are an absolutely constant quantity the world
over-always acting and reacting in a similar manner, however
different in intensity and proportion. They are governed by
laws that are also constant, and fortunately ascertainable.
Therefore leave no stone unturned to discover these laws,
relax no effort that will enable you to understand them, in
order that you may learn so to manipulate them as to compel
them to discourse sweet music of laughter or tears at your
bidding. For this is the whole duty of an actor.
You have to learn to forget yourself in thinking of the
effect you are endeavouring to produce upon your audience.
To act casually, blindly hoping to produce some sort of result,
is poverty-stricken art indeed. The real artist should know
far better precisely what effect he is producing than the
audience does, taken individually-for 'to the artist the
audience is a concrete individual, while to itself it is an
agglomeration of units, divided by social, æsthetic and
intellectual gulfs without number, crystalline and bottomless.
To the actor it is not a crowd of two, mainly consisting of
Clement Scott and William Archer, that fills a London
theatre, neither is it all Lady Clara Vere de Vere, or chiefly
“Bertie from Balham,” or the young lady from Copthall
Court who works a typewriter, or the other young lady from
Magg and Stantle's who reads The Family Mush-tub. There
are other elements in the composition of that sensate entity
he calls “ the audience”; cultured men and men of action,
women of gentle life and those who read and think, as well as

raw humanity from the “beaches ” of the world and black
streaks from the underside---and all that lie between.
Incredible as it may appear, the emotions of these widely
varying types are uniform, differing only in degree and
expression. And the business of the actor is to consider
everything in relation to that homogeneous whole. They are
first, midmost and last. He must know what they are think-
ing, how they feel, and, adapting himself to all their moods
and tenses, must do, must do what they will have him to do-
and when he has succeeded in drilling himself into that, he
need not worry as to whether he is an artist.
As a rule, an audience, taken collectively, knows so much
more of human nature-even the human nature of the par-
ticular sort of man the actor is endeavouring to depict—than the
mummer," and the young actor is so unable to merge his
ego—so unwilling to sink his identity—so persistent in think-
ing more of himself and his part than of the audience and its
artistic demands, that of course he does not produce much
effect, for one cannot expect to move people far by going at
it “ hit or miss.” The really effective actor always knows
the precise emotion he is seeking to arouse, and then goes
steadily and deftly to work to arouse it.
This brings us to a practical issue that lands us flat up
against the “vexed question” once more. Controlling other
people's emotions is much the same as controlling your own.
If you cannot control and hold in subjection your own emotions,
you cannot hope to influence at will those of other people. A
man who cannot control his sentiment of love, one who has
“ lost his head ” by falling in love, cannot interest people very
much by his efforts to represent it. His own emotions over-
come him when he attempts their representation. This may
be taken as true of most, if not all emotions, but it is
especially true of love because that is the grand passion. It
would seem to be self-evident that while one is subject to a
sentiment one cannot hope to represent it forcibly ; it is too

real, too near, it plays havoc with the judgment and declines
to be represented—just as a painter cannot make a picture of
the spot upon which he has pitched his camp-stool. One
cannot be subject to and master of an emotion at one and the
same time.
T
I have read and listened to innumerable discussions upon
whether it is necessary or even desirable for an actor or
actress to enter actively into and realize acutely the emotion
of the character he or she is depicting. There is the school
of sensibility, which holds, and teaches, and insists that it is
absolutely and always necessary to experience at the moment
of presentation the emotion of the personage delineated.
“Give us feeling, that is the prime requisite ; without it all
your art offends.
Unless the artist actually feels the emotion
he is portraying, his work will be lifeless and ineffectual.”
An actor is to feel every emotion he depicts, every time he
depicts it—that appears to be the contention. On the other
hand there are those who, with Diderot, Talma, Molé,
Régnier, Guizot and Coquelin, maintain that absolute self-
command and perfect self-possession are necessary for the
production of the most artistic results, and that to share the
emotion of a character is as fatal to its representation as lying
flat on his back in the middle of a landscape would be to an
artist's chance of making a picture of it.
The first contention appears to savour somewhat of the
elocutionary cant about nature being preferable to "art" in
speech-vide Canon Fleming, et hoc. It is the talk of weak
minded people who will insist upon comparing things, to pro-
fess they prefer art to life. They appear to forget that art is
an idealisation of and generalisation upon life, and therein
are almost as fatuous as the unreasoning multitude which
prefers what it calls nature or life—the set of conventions to
which it is accustomed—to art. The truth appears to be that
art is always desirable, and bad nature invariably detestable-
bad art is a contradiction in terms.

If, as Goethe says, in declamation you must put off your
natural character, deny your own nature, and transport your-
self into the situation and mood of him whose rôle you act, so
that you may feel every emotion as he felt it, then the weep-
ing lady in Fauntleroy ought to have been the most moving
Mrs. Errol, instead of being simply the most moved.
Coquelin hates sensibility in an actor, regarding it as
fatal to art, while Bernhardt is cited as a living instance of
the superb power of an artist who enters vividly into the
emotion of the character she portrays. Let us examine these
two cases in detail.
Coquelin I have watched several times without observing
that his art suffers much because he never allows himself to
be the victim of emotion. Bernhardt I have observed, both
from the front and the wings. She always appears to work
under the stress of high emotion, but, so far as I have been
able to judge, the emotion has not invariably been that of the
character she was impersonating. A certain quick, nervous
tension is upon her the whole time; she is alert, feline,
electric, irritable and trembling on the verge of some sort of
frenzy—but certainly it is not always the emotion she is depict-
ing that sways her.
Forbes Robertson, under similar conditions, has given me
the same impression in a modified form, and of course allowing
for difference of temperament. Charles Cartwright, Mrs.
Patrick Campbell and C. W. Somerset, also occur to me as
cases in point.
Coquelin says : study, observe ; let every tone and gesture
and detail of byplay come under the most microscopic scrutiny,
let them be brought to the artistic touchstone and pronounced
upon in cold blood as to whether they are fit or unfit. How-
ever France came to give birth to Impressionists in Painting
and Literature, there is no house-room for them on her stage.
I have never heard Irving's views upon this subject in detail,
but his practice seems to declare him a disciple of art-

:
at least, he leaves little to the chance that the glib call
“nature."
Diderot says : “The great actor watches appearance ; the
i
man of sensibility is his model ; he thinks over him, and
discovers by after reflection what will be best to add or cut
away. He has listened over and over again to his own voice :
at the very moment when he touches your heart he is listening
to his own voice : his talent depends not, as you think, upon
feeling, but upon rendering so exactly the outward signs of
feeling that you fall into the trap: he has rehearsed to himself
every note of his passion : he has learnt before a mirror every
particle of his despair." Later comes the sledge-hammer
sentence: “In complete absence of sensibility is the possibility
of the sublime actor."
Molé is equally emphatic in the anecdote related by
Lemercier: “The triumph of Molé was the Jaloux sans Amour,
I saw him in this part. I heard him in the scene in which he
renders all the transports of a furious love. I experienced
the most lively emotion, and when the curtain fell I ran to
congratulate him in his dressing room. Well,' said Molé,
I am not satisfied with myself this evening ; I gave myself
up too much and did not remain my own master ; I entered
too deeply into the situation; I was the actual personage and
no longer the actor who represents him. I was true, as I
should be in private ; for theatrical optics, one must be so in
another fashion. The piece will be acted again in a few days,
come and see it once more, and post yourself close in front of
the wings.' I was punctual, as you can well imagine. At
the moment when the famous scene commences, Molé turned
towards me : 'I am quite master of myself this time,' said
he to me, you will see the difference.' And, I must admit,
never did art and preparation more profoundly move an
audience."
Çoquelin, too, is quite definite : “Even when the public,
carried away by his action, conceives the actor to be
6

59
abandoned to his passion, he should be able to see what he is
doing, to judge of his effects and to control himself-in short
he should never feel the shadow of the sentiments to which he
is giving expression, at the time that he is representing them
with the utmost power and truth.”
Talma sounded no uncertain note in this connection.
Again and again he condemns Boileau's famous axiom, “To
make me shed tears you must weep yourself," as a fallacy.
And in his epigrammatic saying, “The artist who fatigues
himself is an indifferent artist,” he included more than those
who indulged in faulty methods of managing the breath in
speaking
One of the best stage-managers I ever worked under-
himself a capable actor of highly emotional parts-once took
a young actor aside at rehearsal and said : " My boy, you
have a jolly good notion of what you want to do, but your
method is all wrong.
You will never move people to
sympathy by snuffling, and sobbing, and other expressions of
grief on your part. You will only give them the pip. You
are inaudible, not pathetic. Feel the emotion, if you must,
but, for heaven's sake, suggest it."
In other words, some sort of self-control and balance is
necessary to the successful depicting of emotion. Capacity
for emotion is of
necessary; a wide and quick
sympathy with all that is distinctively human is imperative in
any man or woman who would portray the passions that
sway humanity ; but, in the words of Régnier, “To keep
one's head, while appearing to give up one's" heart, is the
secret of good actors." Personal equilibrium is vital to the
masterly portrayal of emotion. No artist is competent to
depict the passional side of life until he has experienced
passion, fought the fight out, and gained his balance.
Guizot's utterance is worth pondering: “To successfully
depict a passion, it is certainly necessary to be capable of
feeling it, sometimes even to have actually experienced it;
course
9)

but to feel it at the very moment is not necessary, and often
does harm instead of good.”
Experience throws a strong light of common-sense upon
this question. Actors are a remarkably long-lived class; but
the indulgence of emotion shortens life more than almost any-
thing else; therefore actors, as a class, do not indulge
emotion more than most people-and an obvious corollary is,
the indulgence of emotion is not essential to its successful
portrayal. With what sort of constitutions must Irving,
.
Warner and Shiel Barry have been endowed to stand the
strain of repeated representations of Mathias, Coupeau and
Gaspard, if emotion must necessarily be genuine in order to
be artistic ?
The principle holds in relation to other arts.
After a
certain celebrated performance someone complimented the
Abbé Liszt on his rendering of a particular composition.
“Did I play that?" asked the artist, “I wonder I did it any-
thing like justice ; I didn't feel a bit like it to-day." No, but
he had felt “like it” at some time, and, being a consummate
artist, no keenest critical ear could detect a lack of sympathy
at the moment, for those who heard him that day, and were
competent to judge, were unanimous in declaring that he had
never played more magnificently.
My interest in this subject is purely practical, although the
controversial aspect appeals to me very forcibly; but my
object in endeavouring to arrive at a sound working hypo-
thesis is to warn you against a fallacy which I have seen
work untold mischief. A belief that one must experience an
emotion at the time of its portrayal has led many men to
neglect study and trust to the inspiration or afflatus of the
moment. "I can't try to do it now," is a not infrequent
remark at rehearsal, “I must wait till the night before I can
feel like it." Ladies and gentlemen this is Scylla-at least as
certainly as a blind faith in mechanical precision is Charybdis.
As artists you have no right to trust to “ feeling like it" at
night, for emotion is chary of being commanded.

At the outset of your career you will be called upon to do
a great amount of what you may be tempted to speak of
contemptuously as “hack-work," mere copying and production
of parts that have been created and matured in London or
elsewhere by artists of repute. You will be told what is "the
business," instructed as to the
crosses,” shown the
gestures and probably asked to reproduce the very tones and
facial expressions of the original. If so, I congratulate you;
for there is nothing knocks the conceit out of, or the corners
off a young artist quicker; and if you should have the
extreme good fortune to get work in a “stock company,
for “a stock season,” under a veteran stage-manager, it is
difficult to estimate the value of such an experience. But in
the latter case almost every part you will be called upon to
play will be stereotyped in the mind of the stage-manager to
the minutest detail, and you will discover to your dismay that
nothing worth naming is left to your invention. This will
tent you to the quick, for although you are called upon to do
mere reproduction-work you will learn that there is still room
for individuality, almost as ample as in the case of an actual
creation and the more valuable to you that its display is
subtler. It is the most liberal form of stage-education there
is. If it sinks you to the level of a mere automaton, be
thankful, for that is your level : if on the other hand you
emerge from the ordeal refreshed, stimulated, and with your
individuality unimpaired, you may safely congratulate yourself
that
you have some sort of reason on your side for having
chosen acting as a vocation ; you will have learned what sort
of success you have a right to desire, and what order of
ambition should possess you.
Let me give you a leaf out of a man's experience. A
natural fitness of appearance secured him his first engagement
in a good West-end theatre. He was to understudy a small
part and be prepared to go on tour with the piece at the end
of the London season, His principal fell ill, and on three

rehearsals he was called upon to take the part, speak about a
dozen lines and be much in evidence during the last two out
of three acts. Fortunately for him, Mrs. Kendal had stage-
managed two of his rehearsals, his build was in his favour
and he had been a hard student of Elocution-practising two
to three hours daily for some four years. It was a matinée
performance for which he was called and at ten o'clock he
received a telegram saying he must “play at 2.30” that
afternoon. He reached the theatre at half-past one, but he
was not the first in the dressing room. Seated at the far end
was Alfred Bishop, to whom he confided the position of
affairs. That past-master of “make-up" kindly gave him a
few hints as to how to proceed, and Albert Chevalier, who
dressed at the next place, showed him—unconsciously-how
to use grease-paints, and so on. When the time came for
him to step upon the stage the value of the careful stage-
management to which he had been subjected became
apparent, as also his previous drill in Elocution. The sound
of his own voice was quite inaudible to him and his perform-
ance throughout purely mechanical, but so far satisfactory
that he was retained in the cast for the remainder of the run
of the piece. Then followed three hundred and odd perform-
ances of the same part, during which he met about twenty-
eight different principals, from all of whom he learned some-
thing of his craft.
At the end of the run he played several small parts in
London, and then sought about for an opportunity to try his
hand at character-creating. Hearing of a theatre in Town
that was running a stock-company for the winter season, he
made application and was so fortunate as to be engaged as
utility” at twenty-five shillings per week-about one-third
of the salary he had been receiving. The opening piece was
The Silver King, he was to play the landlord of the public-
house in the first scene, the drunken passenger, and one or
two other small parts during the evening. But at the second

rehearsal he was promoted to Baxter, the detective, and on
Friday to thirty shillings a week on the salary list.
The opportunity of trying his hand at various parts was
complete. The stage-manager was a well-intentioned young
man of the “rough-and-ready" order who had “knocked
about the country with all manner of shows,” to quote his
own words, whose hands were too full with the Scene.
painter, Stage-carpenter, Property-man and others, to admit
of his bestowing much time or attention upon the rehearsals,
besides everyone was supposed to "know his business," and
was further aware that the stage-manager was hard at work
“writing" the pantomime for Christmas. Between Friday
morning and Monday night-often on not more than two full
rehearsals—a fresh piece was produced, and the young man
in search of experience practically created such characters as
the supple Peranza, in The Golden Ladder ; the immovable
Hawkshaw, in The Ticket of Leave Man; Frank Morland, in
Harbour Lights ; Gideon Crawley, in The Streets of London ;
Varney, in Amy Robsart ; Sir Frederick Sydney, in Queen's
Evidence ; Robert Carlton, in Master and Man ; Gilbert
Featherstone, in Lost in London ; and the Count de Liniéres,
in The Two Orphans.
Then the actor who had been playing “ lead” was offered
an engagement at the Comedy Theatre and “the management"
liberated him, on the young seeker-after-experience agreeing
to play such parts as the “star” would have been cast for.
His first "leading part " in London was Gilbert Medland, or
Philip Stanfield, in Queen's Evidence ; then followed Charles
Middlewick, in Our Boys; Connor O'Kennedy, in Green Bushes;
Macari, in Called Back; and so on until a score or so of
original creations of the most diverse order stood to his credit.
I say "original creations,” because it so happened that he
had only seen one, and that the first, of the pieces in which
he was called upon to play. The range of his experience was
much widened by this service, and his ulterior object in going

success
on the stage-which was to write for it, he having already
done much literary work—was eminently served. He has
since written six short pieces, all of which have been
moderately successful, and done work that has been very
favourably criticised, on the stage meanwhile. Much of this
modest
he attributes to his stock-season
apprenticeship, during which he learned to know the theatre,
from “gridiron” to “cellar," and from “paint-room” to
“ box-office."
A greatly controverted point among actors is the necessity
or even advisability of a thorough study of Elocution ; but
this, I fancy, usually results from a misconception.
The
prejudice against is not shared by the artists of the stage, but
is mainly confined to the “ rank and file," the humbler crafts-
men who are likely to remain so-which is significant. It is
the more singular because unconsciously these very people
chiefly rely upon a certain rule-of-thumb facility in Elocution
for the production of such effects as they succeed in realizing.
Artists like Beerbohm Tree, Herman Vezin, Charles
Wyndham, Miss Geneviéve Ward, Forbes Robertson,
Wilson Barrett, Charles Warner, James Fernandez, Miss
Winifred Emery, Sydney Valentine, T. B. Thalberg,
George Alexander, Miss Gertrude Kingston and Herbert
Waring, are practically at with Shakespeare
to the paramount importance of a thorough study and
mastery of this art in relation to the stage, in England, and in
France-the home of perfect enunciation-one has only to
read the utterances of Got, Coquelin, Delaunay, Dupont-
Vernon, Régnier, Legouvé, and a host of authorities, to
realize the unique value that is set by the masters of the
French stage upon the arduous practice and systematic study
of Elocution. As the late Corney Grain used to say:
Englishmen do mumble, we don't learn to use our lips until
we have to make our living by it—and then not always
unless we are paid by results," and yet in the profession

mere
which of all others depends to a great extent upon the use its
members make of their lips, are to be found men and women
who will tell you that Elocution is a thing they have never
bothered to learn-one can well believe it, when listening to
them on the stage!
It is certain that a crystalline articulation is going to be of
the utmost value to you in your calling, and to attain it,
together with a complete mastery of the art of breathing
during speech, is worthy of your most careful attention. No
perfunctory or half-hearted skimming of the subject will serve
your purpose. No unintelligent swallowing of rules or atten-
.
tive listening to lectures from the ablest teachers living will
suffice, or you will simply acquire artificiality without master-
ing the art-which is what is mainly objected against those
who go on the stage making pretensions to having studied or
excelled in Elocution. No
“ elocutionist” should
persuade himself that he is necessarily an "actor," but every
actor should be-must be-a facile elocutionist.
The man of thinnest and weakest voice can be audible and
forceful if he is a trained elocutionist-i.e. if he has mastered
articulation completely—as witness Canon Liddon and
Beerbohm Tree, while many a man with huge, superb and
flexible voice is ineffective and inaudible, because he has
never learned to articulate.
Legouvé mentions a method of Régnier's for strengthen-
ing the articulation in the direction of distinctness. Few
people are born with a thoroughly good articulation.
some it is hard, in others soft, and in others again it is
indistinct. Practice, constant and methodical practice, can
alone correct these defects. But what kind of practice ?
Here is a very ingenious plan which anyone can make use
of, and which is the result of observation. You have an
important secret to confide to a friend, but you are afraid
of being overheard ; the door of the room is open,
and some-
one in the next apartment. You draw near your friend and

whisper in his ear. No; you do not, for fear of being sur-
prised in a position which would betray you. What are you
going to do then? This is your mode of procedure ; I quote
the literal words of the master of masters, of M. Régnier :
“You turn full face to your friend, and so, using the least
sound possible, speaking quite low, you employ the articula-
tion to carry your words to his eyes as well as to his ears, for
he sees you as much as he hears you speak. The articula-
tion, then, has two functions; it performs the office of the
sound itself, and, to this end, it is forced to draw clearly the
words and exaggerate each movement to make it penetrate
the mind of your auditors." Well, there is the infallible
method of correcting all the weakness and the hardness of
your articulation. Submit yourself for some time to this
discipline, and such gymnastic exercise will render the
muscles of articulation so supple and strong that they will
answer by their elasticity to all the movements of your
thought and to all the difficulties of your utterance.
Mr. Solly mentions the plan of certain French teachers
of Elocution, which is to put two small india-rubber balls
between the teeth and cheeks during practice. Speaking
with these in the mouth gives great flexibility to the muscles.
I have made a habit of rehearsing pupils with corks between
the back teeth for giving elasticity and distinctness, and for
increased audibility I find plugging the ears tightly with
cotton wool attended with very beneficial results.
Coquelin writes: “The articulation is to speech what
drawing is to painting-it is at once the alphabet and the
highest point of the art. It should be the first study of the
actor ; the public must understand every word he says, how-
ever quickly he may say it."
Goethe says : “Perfect enunciation should be the first
object of an actor's care. To acquire this the beginner
should speak very slowly, pronouncing each syllable, and
especially the end one, firmly and with decision, so that

rendered." Horace Wigan had a pregnant item of advice
to his pupils regarding the ends of words, which was, “ Bite

the final letter.” Dupont-Vernon's words are, “I only
know in speech one thing which is more important than voice:
that is the articulation.”
I trust enough has been said to make the necessity for
study quite clear to you. A thorough knowledge of the art
A
of expression can be acquired by no other means. No original
talent, no specific personal qualifications can take the place
of study, or be regarded as of superior importance. And this
is a necessity that grows more imperative every day. The
“good old times” when the “ mummer” found it sufficient
to read the Era, and not too much of that, are gone for ever.
To-day men read, voluminously if not thoroughly; and you
must do the same, or be content to find yourselves relegated
to the moribund section of the uncultured.
The subjects of study at which I have hinted are merely
a sample of the matters of importance that challenge your
serious attention. English Literature you dare not neglect.
Base your studies on the sublime translation of the Bible,
that lies beneath ninety per cent. of such literary taste as the
nation possesses and might well contest the balance. It is
the one volume in the language that, in and of itself, forms a
complete library; and apart from all else that it may be to
you, it is the book, the study of which is a liberal education.
The drama you must study. Hellas has bequeathed us no
richer legacy. Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes, and Aris-
tophanes are all available to you at least in the modified form
of translation ; the drama that had its origin in Attica pos-
sesses for you more than an archæological value, seeing that
the last discordant scream of modernity is but a faint and far
echo of its utmost decadence. The Latins, too-earliest of
adaptors-call to you through the lips of Plautus and Terence;
while Seneca and Varius will teach you how men of genius

fail in their efforts at originality when forced to breathe an
atmosphere and interpret a life degraded by brutality and
drunk with the lust of blood. And from the Renaissance
until now—from Shakespeare to Sudermann, from Sheridan
to Pinero, from Goldsmith to Henry Arthur Jones, from Ben
Jonson to Sardou—the drama is yours, yours to study if
you would be an artist worthy the name.
Everything that is essentially of the moment in contem-
porary life is peculiarly a field of study for the actor. Do not
mistake me as meaning that you are to be of the moment-
that is to live the life of the ephemera—but you must know it.
Never become stereotyped in your tastes; a disciple of a cult,
a votary of a fad, a partisan of a phase-that is to degenerate
into a dramatic crank, which only a critic can do, and survive.
Ibsen, Maeterlinck, Daudet, Sudermann-these and such
-
names are often used as Shibboleths. Do not be found
among the screamers, for or against. Little “Brummagem?
Shakespeares are constantly being boomed in the dramatic
market; but if you are an actor and a student of the
drama
you
will do well to remember there is no finality
in art, and the meretricious is not usually characterised by
its modesty. Herr Archgreiner, the apostle of the Ibscene,
succeeds in raising a tempest in a teacup over his determina-
tion to produce Judas the Obscene. A tremendous controversy
is worked up, and a limited number of people achieve
notoriety thereby, among whom are the actors and actresses
taking part in the representation. Be careful, if you are
one of the cast. There is no need for you to “take sides,"
and there is danger in being closely identified with anything
bizarre, outré, or fantastic, although the heresy of to-day may
and often does become the common-place of to-morrow,
and the crowd that at this moment execrates Ibsen will
presently be found paying to see Sudermann.
No branch of art is so subject to phases as the drama;
be careful, as students, not to mistake phases for movements

having in them the elements of permanency. All things that
men may be, do, feel, or contemplate form part of the subject-
matter of the dramatist, and those that are in the air at any
given moment are those most likely to be treated; but your
business is simply to interpret, not to approve or disapprove,
to like or dislike in any degree that is calculated to interfere
with your work as craftsman—but, you must know, and that
involves the closest study of everything that moves the pulses
of contemporary life. As someone has well said :
actors' craft is the type of all the arts, from the point of view
of feeling."
As to opportunities for study I need say but little. The
actor who asks, “When shall I find time to study ? ” can
never be answered. Your whole life is an opportunity for
study. When you are working in Town, you are moving in
a world in which public libraries, reading-rooms, art galleries,
museums, open their doors to you free of charge from early
morning until long after you have gone to your workshop at
night. All the best newspapers, reviews, magazines, and
current books are at your disposal ; rooms, light and firing
being provided for you at other people's expense-unless you
are so fortunate as to pay rates and taxes.
When you are
touring almost equal facilities present themselves. From Mon-
day morning until Saturday afternoon the literary and artistic
resources of the place in which you are staying are at your
disposition. Actors who have once taken the trouble to
master the use of books have greater opportunities of ac-
quiring a liberal education than almost any other class of the
community. Let your first inquiry on entering a town, after
securing your lodgings, be, “Where is the public library?”
and make it a rule to pass some hours of every day therein.
You seldom spend any appreciable amount of time rehearsing
while on tour, or during the run of a piece in Town; and
except in comparatively rare cases, social duties make no
such tax upon your leisure as to render the devotion of a few

hours every day to serious study impracticable. And as you
progress in your profession you will discover that the men
and women who form its brightest ornaments will compare
in reading and general culture with those of any other liberal
calling. You are aiming at excellence, you are never going
to rest content with falling a little lower than mediocrity in
your art; to attain your object you must be studious of the
very best, in literature and other things, and at all costs you
must find or make time and opportunity.
Understand me clearly, you are not justified in hoping for
any measure of success or excellence in this art, unless you
are prepared to bestow the same attention on it as others
give to the arts or professions they follow. As certainly as
painter, musician, writer, soldier, and architect find it neces-
sary to be earnest students, of catholic and cultivated tastes,
so surely the follower of dramatic art must make up his or
her mind upon this subject of the paramount and constant
necessity for study.

SECTION II.
Some Practical Rules for the Mechanical
Portion of the Art of Elocution.
This section contains a brief summary of the main
elements of the art of Elocution. It is merely a digest of first
principles put concisely before the student for purposes of
reference, and to refresh the memory upon fundamentals; it
is in no wise intended to supersede practical instruction or the
use of adequate text-books.
1.-The first care is a well-opened mouth.
Of course this is a very easy thing to anyone really in
earnest, and yet the time and trouble it often costs a teacher
to make his pupils open their mouths is one of the severest
trials of his patience. False shame, conceit, want of simple
earnestness, various causes induce various modes of evading
the natural action required. One partially opens his mouth;
another contracts, or purses up his lips in the attempt ; a
third will insist on opening his mouth horizontally; all more
or less grimacing instead of attaining the desired result by
the simple direct downward movement and stretch of the
lower jaw.
This is an indispensable rule for everyone desirous of
obtaining clearness, flexibility, and power in the management
of his vocal apparatus. Until the student has conquered his
shyness, or affectation--and one is usually a consequence of
the other and opens his mouth to the full extent, freely and

naturally, he will only be taking steps in the art of Elocution
which it will cost him time and pains to retrace. The hardest
learning is to unlearn. Charles Kingsley, in his celebrated
letters to a stammerer, says : “ You must first open your
mouth wide when you speak. You will be afraid to do so at
first, lest people remark it. They will not. Everyone opens
his mouth, and therefore they only observe a person who does
not.” However much Canon Kingsley's dictum is open to
criticism in the case of stammerers, the advice is golden in
the case of a student whose powers of articulation are normal.
To satisfy him on this point, let him with equal force sound
the vowels with his mouth open to its utmost extent, and then
half closed ; let him continue the experiment in reading or
repeating passages, opening the mouth as before, and then
with half shut lips.
This stretching of the mouth will appear awkward at first,
perhaps ridiculous to a ridiculous person, but let the student per-
sist until he gets the joints and muscles into a perfectly flexible
and pliant condition, no peculiarity will then be discernible ;
meanwhile he will have obtained a command and ease in his
utterance that will make the art of speaking a pleasure to
him, the vowels will have their full volume of sound, rich and
clear, the consonants will ring upon the ear with a sharpness
equal to the fineness and severity of outline that a well chiselled
piece of sculpture offers to the eye.
There is a grave danger that may be avoided by strict atten-
tion to this simple recommendation. In passionate declamation,
if the breath be drawn within the narrowed aperture of a half-
closed mouth, the inspiration of air is often audible, producing
a sound jarring upon the taste and unpleasant to the ear.
When the greater demand is made upon the speaker's
power
he
may strain his voice in vain to make it reach farther
at each inspiration, whereas by simply opening his mouth
wider than usual he effects his object with ease to himself and
without offence to his audience.

Again and again I have been impressed, in watching the
late Samuel Brandram, William Ewart Gladstone, John
Gough, and Morley Punshon, by the enormous flexibility of
facial muscles brought into play during speech, and by the
direct, downward drive of the lower jaw. If it be conceded
that without superb articulation excellence in speech is unat-
tainable, then it should be borne in mind that without a
lissom, well-opened mouth, that works with the ease born of
constant practice and perfect drill, superb articulation is
impossible.
Remember, it is method that makes an artist, not endow-
ment, and in the cultivation of method there are no trifles-
except to triflers.
David Bell says several things worthy of careful attention
in this department of our subject, under the heading of
Articulation, in the introductory section of his Modern Reader
and Speaker. “Distinct and graceful utterance requires that
the various groups of words should be preceded by a free,
downward action of the lower jaw. The organic approach or
contact necessary for articulation must be made as rapidly
and lightly as possible, and after any utterance the parts in
approach or contact should be quickly, yet easily, separated,
to allow the free repetition of the same or a different action.”
A letter from a stage-manager friend, whose shortness of
temper is only equalled by his capability, will show the
importance of this simple matter :-“ Dear Ryder, I am
sending with this letter of introduction
a capital
fellow, and full of notions about his work. I am certain he
would make a first-rate character actor, only he won't open
his mouth. I have yelled myself black in the face trying to
make him understand what is the matter with him, but it is

jaw of his. He has got his fortnight's notice, but I don't

you will be doing him the best possible service. Yours very
sincerely,
2.-Management of the Breath in Speaking.
This again is a subject of paramount importance, as a
slight consideration of the bad habits that result from non-
observance of the laws by which it is governed will readily
show. A golden rule in this connection is never make your
audience aware that you breathe at all; the process of
respiration during oral delivery should be as unobserved as
the circulation of the blood.
Let there be no gasping, but quiet, steady breathing.
This is best promoted by causing the diaphragm—the base-
ment of the lungs—to rise and fall regularly ; for if the
breathing is carried on by the muscles of the higher ribs and
breast bone, so much is detracted from the power of utter-
ance, which frequently makes a demand upon the same
muscles. Puffing out the chest until it resembles a pouter
pigeon is not good breathing. No method of breathing is
natural that dilates the chest-walls from above downwards ;
it is vicious, fatiguing and ineffectual.
The student should obtain a copy of Dr. E. B. Shuldham's
book on Clergyman's Sore Throat, published by Gould, of 59,
Moorgate Street, and carefully read his luminous utterances
on this subject. Here are some extracts; but everything
from the pens of Dr. Shuldham, Dr. Morrell Mackenzie, and
M. Lennox Browne is worth its weight in gold to the earnest
student of the art of speech :- .“ In health and silence we
breathe and take no thought of it, but as soon as we put the
muscles of the body into active motion, we feel that this
breath-taking is a matter for consideration. In walking fast,
a
in running, in jumping, in lifting heavy weights, how is it
that some of us get scant of breath? For want of physical

75
an
power, and for lack of art in breath-taking. In singing, in
long-continued speaking, shortness of breath likewise results
under similar conditions, viz. : physical weakness and lack of
art. Let us dismiss the first, as physical weakness is rather
accident of birth and structure, and therefore less
remediable; whereas lack of art springs from a lack of
education, and education is possible to all. The best runner
is as a rule, other things being equal, the best breath-taker;
the best singer and the best speaker are likewise the most
judicious breath-takers,”—the freest inspirers, the most
economical expirers. “Great runners for long distances are
not notoriously, nor of necessity, great athletes, but often
thin, spare people with little to carry, with large bellows for
lungs and plenty of judgment in using them.” Neither, of
necessity, are the greatest singers of athletic build-as
witness Mr. Watkin Mills and the late Signor Foli—"but
they have good bellows, use them with art, and so their
machinery rarely requires mending."
"The reverse is true of bad runners and bad singers, their
bellows are always getting out of order and requiring the
services of medical or elocutionary tinker. This being the
case, the management of the breath in speaking is not so
simple a matter as at first sight it might appear to be ; for as
soon as any pressure is brought to bear upon the lungs in the
way of general bodily or localized muscular exercise, we find
that this pressure is best borne by the most intelligent and the
best trained : it then becomes essentially a question of art, a
matter for thought and education.”
“Let us first consider the natural process of breathing in
a state of health. How do we breathe? We breathe by letting
fresh air flow into the lungs and stale air flow out of them.
We breathe by a muscular effort, an effort that has been
called into action by a nerve stimulus. No muscular effort
can be possible without the nerve being awake and ready to
touch the quiescent muscle. We then take in supplies of

76

>
fresh air by muscular action ; it is by rightly applying this
muscular force that we learn to breathe with ease and with
judgment."
“Here are the lungs waiting to be stocked with air, ware-
houses ready to be filled, in basement, first or second storey ;
there are the cranes, pulleys, and ropes, ready to do the
storage. Which is the most important part of our warehouse,
which will stretch most to accommodate the goods ? Why,
the basement. The bases of our lungs fill best, most
easily, and the parts below the bases are most accommodating ;
therefore that form of breathing called by some authors the
abdominal, and by others the diaphragmatic is the one which
should for physiological reasons be adopted. The bases of
the lungs rest on soft yielding structures. The diaphragm is
a large muscle that separates the lungs from the abdominal
viscera; it is, in fact, a kind of lift between the lower storey
of the chest and the upper storey of the abdomen, but though
it constantly goes below into the abdomen, it only carries the
same passengers, and these are the lungs. When we take in
breath, the lungs expand and down goes the diaphragm lift,
with the lungs resting on the upper surface ; when we let out
air from the lungs, up goes the lift and carries back its
passengers quietly and with great care."
“But there are other ways of breath-taking besides by the
use of this muscular lift. There is the lateral or costal
method, or breathing by the ribs, and there is the clavicular,
or breathing by the collar bones. Now when we mark out
all these methods specially, we do a right thing, for we draw
attention to the physiology of breathing, and we individualize
the methods; but truly there can be no breathing by the
diaphragm without some use of the ribs and the muscles that
set those ribs in motion, therefore these two forms verge into
each other, only with this difference, that the use of the
diaphragm should be thought of first, and the use of the ribs
should be an after-thought in this great art of breathing. In

77
the effort to fill the lungs with air, we find that as there is
less opposition to lung expansion from below, than from the
bony corset above and at the sides, therefore to breathe by
the diaphragm is less fatiguing, and also allows of greater
lung expansion. Can we hesitate, then, to choose it?"
“The breathing by clavicle or collar bone is wrong in
every way, and we believe that really it is not often put into
practice, for one good reason, namely, because it is a difficult
method and requires great muscular effort. As the apices of
the lungs are encased by unyielding upper ribs and stout
muscular tissue, we can see at once that lung expansion in
this upper storey can never be great, nor easy of manage-
ment; and therefore breath-taking by the collar bones should
never be practised, as its results are disastrous to health and
voice production. It leads to muscular strain, inartistic use
of voice, weakness, and finally perhaps to loss of voice, with
irritation of pharynx, and thus to 'Clergyman's Sore
Throat.''
“Now, as we have spoken of breath-taking or inspiration,
we should have a few words for breath-parting with or
expiration. The breath-taking should be handed over to the
care of the diaphragm and ribs, and therefore ribs and
diaphragm should again render their services in driving out
the air from the lungs. Both processes require judgment.
Unless the lungs are well provisioned with air, we cannot
carry on the business of speech or song with activity ; and
unless judgment be exercised in parting with our stock, our
respiratory affairs become embarrassed, and in desperate or
extreme cases bankruptcy ensues. In plain English, an artist
must learn to expire, to part with breath, just as much as to
inspire, or take in breath. His inspiration should be quietly
made, without effort or sound, almost without sign, with
closed lips for all manner of speech, and with slightly parted
lips for song; the shape of the mouth should in the very act
of singing be moulded in harmony with the vowel sounds.
F

The head should be erect, the muscles of the neck free, the
shoulders thrown back, the chest thrown forward, and both
chest and abdomen free from all restraint of tightly fitting
dress—too much stress cannot be laid upon the absolute
importance of this last condition. Then as air is taken in by
the nostrils, or by the open mouth, the muscles of the
abdomen should relax and the speaker or singer should almost
feel the diaphragm descending, the ribs rising, and the
abdomen filling out."
“The breath-taking should never be spasmodic nor
hurried. This comes of too frequent inspiration, and lack
of art; this leads to the panting sounds of inelegant speakers;
this brings about rapid fatigue of voice, and, sooner or later,
develops the symptoms of Clergyman's Sore Throat.' The
speaker or singer should regulate his inspiration according to
his subject, his phrase, his power ; his provision of air should
neither be too scant, nor yet should it overload his lungs.
In very deep and prolonged inspiration there is a tendency to
part with the air too suddenly, as the muscular power that
raised the ribs is being counterbalanced by those muscles that
lower the ribs, for there is a constant interchange of force
going on when breathing in and breathing out. If the act of
inspiration is too prolonged, the act of expiration will be
shortened. This point has not been sufficiently dwelt on, or
adequately developed, by writers on elocution or singing.
The faults of too frequent and spasmodic inspiration have
been pointed out over and over again, and the invariable
instruction has been given inspire long and deeply.' A good
lesson in truth, but it has its dangers and these should be
pointed out. Some authors write as though all a singer or
speaker has to do is to fill the lungs choke-full of air and then
beautiful speech and song must of necessity flow forth. We
would say 'Inspire long enough for the musical or elocution-
ary phrase that is to follow the breath-taking, not long
enough to fatigue the lung tissue or the inspiratory muscles.'

Yes, truly, 'fatigue,' as, though the strain is but short-lived,
yet, if continued, it leads to this condition.”
“ The expiration should also be easy and without effort.
When the air leaves the lungs to be converted into sound,
there should still be no strain, no visible effort, but the sound
should flow out evenly and without any consciousness on the
artist's part of his possessing a larynx to warble through, or
a pair of bellows to propel the sound. There should be even
less effort in breathing out sound than there is in breathing
in air. The artist may be and must be conscious of purity of
sounds but intensity of sound must be produced without
visible muscular effort. All swelling of the veins of the neck
and of the forehead, and all getting red in the face, point at
once to the use of clavicular breathing and lack of art in
voice production. An incident in the life of Talma, the great
French tragedian, is worth relating in this connection : it
points a moral on the art of taking breath." It is quoted from
M. Legouvé's L'Art de la Lecture, a little book full of interest
and instruction to all who value the reader's art.
It is as
follows: “When Talma was still a young man, he was acting
in Diderot's Pere de Famille. After the delivery of the cele-
brated passage, 'An income of fifteen hundred a year, and
my Sophie,' he left the stage, and went behind the scenes
exhausted, out of breath, and leaned against a side-scene,
panting like an ox.' 'Idiot;' said Molé, looking at him,
' and you want to play tragedy! Come and see me to-morrow
morning, and I will teach you how to personate passion,
without getting out of breath.' Talma called on him ; but
whether the master failed in patience, or the pupil in docility,
we cannot tell ; at any rate, he only half profited by his
lesson. About the same time there was an actor of the name
of Dorival, a spare, weakly fellow, without any power of
voice, yet, nevertheless, he played tragedy with a certain
amount of success. • How can the wretch do it?' said
Talma. 'I am ten times as strong as he is, and yet he tires

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
himself ten times as little as I do. I will ask him his secret.'
Dorival put off the request with this gently sarcastic reply,
which, by the way, smacked somewhat of jealousy : You
are so successful, M. Talma, that you do not require any
lessons.' 'I will make you give me some, for all that,'
whispered Talma to himself.' One day as Dorival was
playing Châtillon in Zaïre the young man (Talma) hid him-
self—where do you think? in the prompter's box, so as to
see and hear unobserved. There, couched in obscurity like
a beast of prey in its den, he watched every movement, took
note of it, looked, listened, and after the famous declamatory
speech in the second act left the box, exclaiming, “I have it,
I have nailed him.' (Je l'ai pincé.) What had he dis-
covered? That Dorival's whole art consisted in a certain
talent for taking breath. In what did this consist ? In
taking breath before the lungs were completely emptied of air
(I copy one of Talma's own notes); and to prevent the public
from noticing these frequent inspirations, which would have
marred the even tenor of his speech, and arrested the current
of his emotion, he made use of them especially before the A,
the E, and the O sounds, that is to say, at the time when, his
mouth being open, he was able to breathe lightly without the
audience perceiving it."
“We see what an important part respiration plays in the
art of speaking. Its rules are the only ones which should
never be violated. The orator once launched forth in a
passage full of movement, carried away by emotion, by
anger, by tears, may forget the laws of punctuation, set aside
full-stops and commas, but he must always be master of his
breath, even at the very time when he seems to lose it. A
good orator has no right to be out of breath, except for
dramatic effect. Talma had reduced all these rules to one
emphatic maxim : "The artist who fatigues himself is but an
indifferent artist.'"* And nowhere does this aphorism more

forcibly apply than in the art of breathing. Signor Crivelli
says:
· The clear and elastic vibrations of sound depend on
the art of breathing gently, never forcing the breath in the
production of the voice, but always sparing it in such a
manner that the fibres and muscles of the throat may not be
irritated. Thus, knowing how to spare and make good use
of the breath is of the greatest importance, as from this is
derived the power of sustaining the sounds-of sending forth
the voice in the most energetic or in the most delicate manner
so as to express with true colouring whatever emotion or
passion the poet and composer may wish to describe.” Canon
Fleming has a useful chapter on the management of the
breath in his book, The Art of Reading and Speaking,
published by Edward Arnold, 37, Bedford Street, London.
The following is particularly recommended as a practice
when alone, viz., the exercise of the breath by drawing in an
inspiration to the very top of your capacity, and trying how
many lines you can utter with distinct formation of the words,
till the indraught be exhausted. The good effect of this
practice will be found in the ability it will give to make the
pauses in your sentences at your own choice; a power of
control that is of the utmost value.
Be careful in your pauses, whether merely for breath or for
the enforcement of your argument, to stop upon points of a
sentence upon which its main interest depends; the listener
is more eager to drink in what is thus artfully delayed, besides
being afforded the opportunity of grasping the sense of what
is being said.
3.-Articulation.
*Articulation, by which is meant the distinct utterance of
spoken words, is sometimes confounded with pronunciation,
although they are to a great extent dissimilar ; the former is
the linking together of the elementary sounds, so as to form
them into syllables and words; the latter refers to the vocal

82
ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
sound produced, and is either correct or incorrect, according
as it conforms with, or deviates from that which for the time
being-is considered the true standard.
For present purposes articulation may be taken as mean-
ing the clear and exact rendition by the voice of the sounds
indicated by the collection of letters constituting a word. It
mainly concerns two things. ist. Audibility; 2nd. Distinct-
ness. Audibility consists in the force with which the vowel
sounds are emitted. Distinctness is the clearness and
accuracy of the consonant sounds and influences, for conso-
nants usually have no specific sound. To test audibility
ascertain the distance at which the vocal sounds can be
heard ; to test distinctness, learn the distance at which the
words uttered can be easily recognised.
A word is a collection of letters. To each letter, or sign,
a certain sound is attached, which is modified when letters
are placed in combination with each other to form words. A
practical knowledge of these elementary sounds, or an ability
to produce them-perfection in which is often rather acquired
than natural—is the basis of Elocution.
The alphabet is divided into vowels and consonants.
Vowels are sounds generated in the glottis, which pass freely
through the mouth and receive their peculiar distinctive
characters in their passage. They form syllables without the
aid of a consonant, and may be prolonged indefinitely. A
consonant is dependent upon a vowel, and cannot be named
or described without its aid. A consonant does not so much
represent a distinct sound itself, but its function consists in
influencing the pronunciation of vowels. Thus in the word
car the consonants govern the pronunciation, although taken
separately they have no articulate sound. Vowels may be con-
sidered as the raw material of speech, consonants as the means
of moulding that material into an infinite variety of forms.

)
Each syllable in a word, and each word in a sentence,
however unemphatic, must be distinctly and clearly pro-
nounced. The common habit of slurring unaccented syllables
should be carefully avoided.
Some of the principal sounds in accented and unaccented
syllables are :
VOWELS,
a, as in bar, bare, bat, bate, quantity, ward, taught, courage.
e, mete, met, mercy, haven.
0, dome, Tom, form, move, comfort, glove.
น, must, fur, tune.
COMBINED VOWELS,
oi, boil, joy.
ou, hound, power, ounce, trough, rough.
SUCCESSIVE VOWELS,
poetry, fiery, hiatus, aërial.
CONSONANTS.
Consonants are sounds which are produced by the partial
or total interruption of the vocalized or unvocalized breath by
some of the organs of speech, and are therefore called Literac
Clausae. The consonants pronounced by themselves might
seem valueless, but an idea of their function and importance
in the composition of a word may be obtained by attempting
to sound that word without their aid. Take away the breath
sound at the end of the word nip, and it becomes quite
unrecognisable.
p is produced by putting the lips together and abruptly
taking them apart with the forcible emission of the breath, as

When the d stands as the final consonant in a word,

as a separate syllable, as in burned, danced, laughed, etc., but
otherwise the d sound must be distinctly pronounced. It is
a frequent error to slur the final consonant in a work or omit
it altogether. Thus clergymen are guilty of talking about

a
The sounds given above are some of the principal of those
generally used in the formation of syllables, and if the pupil
can speak them with perfect accuracy it is a fair inference that
he will not find any difficulty in pronouncing the great
majority of words in the language, which are composed of
the above sounds, or others analagous to them.
The general rule of articulation is that each word should
be so distinctly pronounced as to carry its own meaning
-shine by its own light, as it were-and not be dependent
upon the context for recognition. A common habit is to slur
the unaccented syllables in a sentence and depend upon its
most prominent or characteristic sounds for its recognition.
An audience should be helped by the speaker to recognise the
words, not left to their own exertions to discover his meaning,
and this help can be best afforded by his enunciating each
word clearly and with full volume, with all its characteristic
sounds, so that his meaning may be understood as the words
are spoken, not merely inferred at the close of a sentence.
If a word begins with the same consonant as that with which
the previous word closes, the two distinct sounds must be
given-the first word must be fully pronounced before the
second is commenced ; as, for instance, found-drowned and
not foun-drowned. If there is any difficulty in preventing
these two sounds from being merged into one, a slight pause
must be made between them. This
pause, if carefully made,
need not cause the speaking to appear either formal or
disjointed.
4.--Modulation.
The wildest confusion often exists in the mind of the
student between modulation and inflection, and I have found
writers and teachers using both terms indiscriminately in a
manner calculated to hopelessly bewilder the reader or pupil.
Let it be borne in mind that modulation refers to the voice

87
and inflection to words, and each becomes luminous. We
modulate the voice and we inflect words-often by means of
modulations of the voice.
Nothing is more distressing to the speaker, or more incon-
sistent with good oratory, than one continued level of voice
in delivery. The rules of modulation govern the change of
the voice from a lower to a higher tone, or otherwise, and
regulate its movements slower or faster, or fast to slower, as
the case may be. The tones and movement of the voice are
determined by the relative importance of the clauses or
sentences to be spoken.
* The voice is a musical instrument capable of exquisite
variety of tone, and of being adapted to the expression of
every peculiarity of thought, every kind of reasoning, every
shade of strong passion, and every delicate refinement of
pathos.
There is a register of the voice in speaking as in singing,
a proper attention to which is necessary. Variety of tone is
not only demanded by the sense of the words but is also con-
ducive to the ease of the speaker and the pleasure of the
listener. The voice must be made as flexible and sympathetic
as possible, and all its tones producible at command, from
the deep chest-note to the high falsetto. For this purpose
a scale has been constructed and applied to the following
lines. No. I represents the lowest, and No. 6 the highest and
loudest declamatory pitch of which the voice is capable.
(1.) Hark to the trump and the drum,
(2.) And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
(3.) And the flap of the banners that flit as they're borne,
(4.) And the neigh of the steed and the multitudes' hum,
(5.) And the clash and the shout,“They come !" (6.) “They come”!
The above is an exercise in a regularly ascending scale.
The difference of tone, or, in other words, the distance
between No. I and No. 6 will represent the capacity of voice
for expressive speaking.

sense.
Having learnt to distinguish between the various sounds
of his own voice, the next thing for the student is to
apply this knowledge practically by changing the tones of
the voice at each modification of sense.
A sentence generally contains a complete idea—"some-
thing is said about something"-or a series of ideas,
independent in themselves yet connected by the general
An idea, as it is generally unfolded in a series of
words, is subject to the usual law of development-continual
modification ; that is to say, the sense of the sentence in the
opening clause is enlarged or modified by what follows, until
the full idea is expressed. The least important part of the
sentence will be marked by a light and rapid modulation, and
the most important by a full, emphatic, and slower tone. But
a sentence in a series of sentences must not be read as if it
stood by itself. The student must use his judgment and
power of discrimination, and first discover the relative value
of the sentence-or clause—as it stands in its context, and by
his manner of reading it convey to his hearers the value he
attaches to it as being more or less important than others
to the proper elucidation of the author's meaning. Take, for
example, the opening sentence of the following extract. The
most important clause is undoubtedly the last, printed in
italics ; and this should be spoken with greater force and
emphasis than those which precede it, because it contains the
idea which dominates, as it were, the series of which it is the
end. The same plan will be pursued in reading the whole
extract. The parenthetical clauses will, of course, be marked
by a different modulation from the rest, because a parenthesis
is something interpolated in the middle of the sentence, to
explain or illustrate its precise meaning, and does not belong
to the sentence by ordinary grammatical construction.
The following extract is full of pictures, and the voice
should be so modulated as to give each detail of a picture so
as to express its intrinsic value and its relative importance,

89
and to give the sentiment arising out of or associated with a
picture in the fullest tone and most deliberate movement of
voice. Nothing implies command over the voice more than
deliberation ; it is therefore a source of strength in itself, and
it is to be understood that the most deliberate style of speak-
ing, other things being equal, is usually the most effective.

“The fall of our illustrious and happy city was supernatural: the de-
struction of the conquered was against the first principles of the Roman
policy; and to the last hour of our national existence, Rome held out
offers of peace, and lamented our frantic disposition to be undone : but
the decree was gone forth from a mightier throne. During the latter
days of the siege, a hostility, to which that of man was as a grain of
sand to the tempest that drives it on, overpowered our strength and
senses; fearful shapes and voices in the air—visions starting us from
our short and troublesome sleep--lunacy in its hideous forms-sudden
death in the midst of vigour—the fury of the elements let loose upon
our heads. We had every terror and evil that could beset human nature
but pestilence—the most probable of all, in a city crowded with the
famishing, the diseased, the wounded, and the dead. Yet, though the
streets were covered with unburied, though every well and trench was
teeming, though six hundred thousand corpses were flung over the ram-
parts, and lay naked to the sun, pestilence came not ;-for if it had
come, the enemy would have been scared away. But the abomination
of desolation,' the pagan standard, was fixed where it was to remain
until the plough had passed over the ruins of Jerusalem. On this fatal
night no man laid his head upon the pillow. Heaven and earth were in
conflict. Meteors burned over us——the ground shook under our feet-
the volcanoes blazed—the wind burst forth in irresistible blasts, and swept
the living and the dead in whirlwinds far into the desert. We heard the
bellowing of the distant Mediterranean, as if its waters were at our sides,
swelled by the deluge. The lakes and rivers roared and inundated the
land. The fiery sword shot out tenfold fire-showers of blood fell—thunder
pealed from every quarter of the heavens-lightning, in immense sheets,
of an intensity and duration that turned the darkness into more than
day, withering eye and soul, burned from the zenith to the ground, and
marked its track by forests of flame, and shattered the summits of the
hills. Defence was unthought of, for the mortal enemy had passed from
the mind. Our hearts quaked for fear; but it was to see the powers of
heaven shaken. All cast away the shield and spear, and crouched before
the descending judgment. Now came the last and most wonderful sign
that marked the fate of rejected Israel. While I lay helpless, I heard
the whirlwind roar through the cloudy hill, and vapours began to revolve.
A pale light, like that of the rising moon, quivered on the edges of the

horizon; and the clouds rose rapidly, shaping themselves into the forms
of battlements and towers. The sound of voices was heard within, low
and distinct, yet strangely sweet. Still the lustre brightened; and the
airy building rose, tower on tower and battlement on battlement, in awe
that held us mute. We knelt and gazed on this more than mortal archi-
tecture, that continued rising and spreading, and glowing with a serener
light, still soft and silvery, yet to which the broadest moonlight was dim.
At last it stood forth to earth and heaven, the colossal image of the
first Temple of the building raised by the wisest of men, and con-
secrated by the Visible Glory. All Jerusalem saw the image ; and the
shout that, in the midst of their despair, ascended from the thousands
and tens of thousands, told that proud remembrances were there. But
a hymn was heard that might have hushed the world beside. Never fell
on my ears, never on the human sense, a sound so majestic yet so sub-
duing-so full of melancholy yet of grandeur and command. The vast
portal opened, and from it marched a host, such as man had never seen
before, such as man shall never see but once again—the guardian angels
of the City of David. They came forth gloriously, but woe in all their
steps--the stars upon their helmets dim—their robes stained-tears
flowing down their celestial beauty. Let us go hence!' was their song
of sorrow. • Let us go hence!' was answered by sad echoes of the
mountains. Let us go hence !' swelled upon the night to the further.
most limits of the land.”—Croly.
Modulation applied to Illustrative Passages.
Imagery is interwoven in language. It is the golden
thread which runs through all literature. Religion itself in
one sense, is a system of images, through which we try to
appreciate that which is otherwise inappreciable. The merit
and effect of poetry depend upon imagery. We judge a poet
by the class of images he uses, and the effect of his sentiment
is proportioned to the readiness with which we apprehend his
meaning through the picture-phrases he employs, or the
analogies between things known and unknown that he draws.
The prose of literature and the talk of common life are largely
made up of conscious and unconscious illustration. Many
words are used to express abstraction, which are really
pictures of actual things, offering to our mind, if we did
but know it, “the visual image that forms their primary

91
meaning." Tribulation, for instance, calls up the threshing-
machine of the Romans; caprice, the unaccountable springs
and leaps of the goat.
In reading illustrative words or clauses, the modulation
must be adapted to their importance, and generally they are
the most important in a sentence, or a series of sentences.
An author uses illustration to make his reasoning more clear,
his sentiments more impressive, his descriptions more forcible.
The illustration, therefore, bears the weight of the meaning,
and should be brought into prominence by appropriate changes
of voice.
The principal forms of illustration are hyperbole, personi-
fication, simile, and metaphor. It might be said, however,
speaking generally, that the word metaphorical embraces all
classes of illustration.
Hyperbole is exaggeration or diminution, raising or
depressing things beyond or beneath their true proportions,
in order to make them more striking and fix attention upon
them :-
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.”
“ He was so gaunt, the case of a flageolet was a mansion for him."
Simile, introduced by the words as or like, is the common
mode of illustration. It is a comparison of things unknown
with things known, an explanation of abstractions by their
analogy to something more familiar and appreciable :--
“The ship goes through the water as the plough goes through
the land."
“They came like mountain torrent red,
That thunders from its rocky bed ;
They broke like that same torrent's wave
When swallowed by a darksome cave.”-Scott.
“ But pleasures are like poppies spread,
You seize the flower, its bloom is shed :
Or like the snow falls in the river,
A moment white, then melts for ever;
Or like the rainbow's lovely form,
Evanishing amid the storm."-Burns.

... and called
His legions, Angel forms, who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa.”—Milton.
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus; and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves."—Shakespeare.
“Men fear death as children fear to go into the dark; and as that
natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other."-Bacon.
Shelley's Ode To a Skylark, possibly, without making
invidious distinctions, the most exquisite lyrical gem in the
English language, abounds in metaphor to an almost unique
degree, and is therefore of the utmost value to the student,
whose aim should be so to bring into relief each simile by
delicate variety of modulation as to render it responsible for
the meaning of that particular idea or statement which it is
employed to illustrate.
In Metaphor the relations of two different things are not
merely compared, as in a simile, but the qualities of one thing
are actually transferred from one to the other ; thus :-" the
ship ploughs the water,” “the moon rains out her beams,"
and as in Tennyson's image embodying the idea of prayer :
• For so the whole round earth is every way
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.”
Personification is one of the most striking means of
metaphorical or illustrative expression. The modulation of
the voice must be adapted to render prominent the words
which mainly suggest the personifications.
In all attempts to develope the tones of the voice the
student should take as his base of operations the tone in
which he generally speaks. Then try higher and lower tones.
Do not confuse between mere loudness and a higher tone.
You may speak softly or loudly, employing precisely the same
tone. Pitch, intensity, and duration are all distinct, and
should not be confounded. A high tone is not necessarily a
loud one.

inequalities arising from weakness or mismanagement of
voice-is thoroughly artistic and excellent. But sustained
monotone is distressing to the speaker, inartistic and objec-
tionable to the listener. The rules of modulation govern the
changes of the voice from a lower to a higher tone, or other-
wise, and generally speaking regulate its movement-lower
usually means slower, and higher tones generally justify a
quicker pace. The tone and corresponding movement of the
voice are determined by the relative importance of the sentences
spoken. Broadly considered, modulation may be taken to
signify the accommodation of the voice to all the shades and
varieties of thought and emotion. It gives light and shade
to speech ; variety and charm are its results, when employed
for the purpose of inflecting words, and infinite practice in
modulation will give the voice flexibility, suppleness, and
extended compass.
Conversational, descriptive, and narrative passages should
be given in the middle tones of the voice, the more important
clauses call for the employment of a higher or lower tone
according to the sense. Gravity and solemnity are best
expressed by the lower tones; impassioned argument, appeal,
entreaty, and certain kinds of emphasis are indicated by the
higher tones.
5.-Inflection.
The distinction between modulations of the voice and the
inflection of words will be clearly perceived if it is borne in
mind that the same sentence may be spoken with the voice
modulated to any given tone, and yet uttered in a monotone
unless certain words are inflected.
Inflection is that turn or slide of the voice from one note
to another by means of which the relative values of words or
clauses in a sentence are indicated. In song the tones of the
voice proceed from note to note, each being clear-cut and
G

complete in itself; in speech we undulate above or below a
certain dominant tone, and these undulations of the voice on
words are called inflections. Inflection may be considered as
the departure of the voice from the monotone in a continued
elevation or depression. When the voice slides upwards on a
word we are said to use the rising inflection, when it slides
downward we are said to use the downward inflection.
Sometimes these two are used in one word or clause, forming
what is called a circumflex ; when there is first a downward
then an upward slide of the voice, it is called the rising
circumflex; when there is first an upward, then a downward
slide of the voice, it is called the falling circumflex. A
sustained use at regular intervals of the rising and falling
circumflexes produces the tremolo, sometimes employed in
indicating certain emotions.
*By the aid of inflection words or clauses become pointed,
and their connection and relative importance rendered clear
and intelligible to an audience. Thus, if the voice is
sustained at the end of a clause, it shows to the audience that
the expression of the sense is still incomplete, even if a long
pause be made.
The slide or turn of the voice is upon the
accented syllable of the emphatic word, the remaining
unemphatic words in the clause, if any, being given on the
same level of voice as is reached by the inflection : thus,
“ Did he say presents of his friends or presence of his
friends ? ” with the upward on presents and the downward on
presence.
An ordinary sentence is generally composed of two or
more clauses. When certain of these clauses are in imperfect
sense, that is, not containing in themselves a sensible idea,
but dependent for their meaning upon the other parts of the
sentence, they must be spoken with the upward inflection.
During the utterance of a sentence the voice must not be
allowed to fall until the final clause, unless the various clauses

a
in themselves are independent of the context for their
meaning
There is a point of much importance which I should like
to make clear at this juncture. The student will meet with
the most conflicting instructions as to raising or lowering the
voice at the ends of sentences. For instance, I read in
one work on Elocution : “ Beware of dropping the voice at
the end of a sentence; a very common vice with speakers is
to lose grip of the last words, this is often fatal to the com-
pleteness of the sense, and always, if even the full meaning be
guessed at, to the elocutionary effect.” In another book from
the
pen
of sometime Professor of Elocution in the Univer-
sity of Oxford,” I read : “Mr. Cox, speaking of the common
habit of lowering the voice at the ends of sentences, directs
the student to adopt a plan which would lead him into a far
more serious fault. He says, “I remember once being at a
rehearsal at Drury Lane with one of our great actors. I
expressed surprise that he did not speak louder, as it seemed
to me that his voice was not raised much beyond that of
ordinary conversation ; yet it filled the house, and came back
to us. He explained to me that it really was so.
to speak twice as loud, he said, I should not be heard half so
well. To be heard by a large audience, you have only to
speak slowly and to raise your voice at the end of every sen-
tence. It was a lesson not to be forgotten, and having tried
and proved it, I recommend it to you.' This is the worst
recommendation that could be given. The raising of the
voice by the use of the rising inflection has been, and is, the
greatest blemish in the elocution of some excellent actors,
which fault they have acquired during their provincial
novitiate by imitating this peculiarity of indifferent actors.
Of course it is much easier to be heard by adopting this plan
than by speaking in the other way, but it is foreign to the
nature and custom of the English language as spoken by
natives who are educated and free from provincialism.”
If I were

The fact is, no hard and fast rule can be made as to
raising or lowering the voice at the end of a sentence. .
one understands what he is saying, he will inflect more or
less correctly. When the sense is incomplete the rising in-
flection will be used, despite the occurrence of a period ; when
the sense is complete the falling inflection will come naturally,
that is, generally speaking, but there are numerous
exceptions.
There is a gradual fall of the voice that is natural towards
the end of a sentence, and is called the cadence ; and as there
is no part of a sentence of more importance than the close of
it, great care should be taken to pronounce it distinctly. But
it is a mistake to confound inflection with force. The power
of the voice must be sustained to the end of every sentence ;
but this has really nothing to do with inflection, either rising,
falling, or circumflex. Do not decrease the power with which
you speak, or you may become inaudible. You have no right
to demand an effort of hearing from your audience, and as
surely as you do, you will be rewarded by inattention-you
will lose your grip. The upward inflection is indicative of
incompleteness, indecision, of something more to follow; the
downward, of complete sense and emphatic decision.
Conditional clauses should be spoken with sustained and
suspensive voice, so as to carry on the conditions to their
fulfilment or completion in the final clause. Sometimes
conditional clauses are independent of each other and only
connected with the final clause ; in this case the difference
between each condition may be marked by a falling inflection,
but the last of the conditional clauses must be given with a
strong upward inflection to connect it, and preceding clauses,
with the conclusion of the sentence.
The following sentences may be spoken effectively either by
giving the upward inflection at the ends of the suspensive
clauses except the last, or a slightly downward turn of the voice
at the end of each conditional clause, except the last clause of

a
this character, which should be given with a very strongly
marked upward movement on the word “relief” to connect
the series with the conclusion which covers all. But perhaps
the best way is to keep the idea of the incompleteness of the
clauses intact by the upward inflection throughout, so that
the conclusion will be naturally expected and waited for.
“Now, if nature should intermit her course, and leave altogether,
though it were but for a while, the observation of her own laws; if those
principal and mother elements of the world, whereof all things in this
lower world are made, should lose the qualities which now they have ; if
the frame of that heavenly arch erected over our heads, should loosen
and dissolve itself; if celestial spheres should forget their wonted
motions, and by irregular volubility turn themselves any way, as it might
happen; if the prince of the lights of heaven, which now as a giant doth
run his unwearied course, should, as it were, through a languishing
faintness, begin to stand and to rest himself; if the moon should wander
from her beaten way, the times and seasons of the year blend themselves
by disordered and confused mixture, the winds breathe out their last
gasp, the clouds yield no rain, the earth be defeated of heavenly influence,
the fruits of the earth pine away as children at the withered breasts of
their mother no longer able to yield them relief;—what would become
of man himself whom these things do now all serve ? See we not plainly
that obedience of creatures unto the law of nature is the stay of the
whole world ?”-Hooker.
The conditional, imperfect, and negative clauses in the
following extract may be spoken with the upward infection ;
words expressing distinction or comparison between ideas or
qualities with upward, followed by downward inflections, and
complete clauses and ends of sentences with downward turns
of the voice.
“ A character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so authoritative,

tency of his glory, and the ruin of his victories; but the history of his

the understanding through the painful subtlety of argumentation, nor
was he for ever on the rack of exertion; but rather lightened upon the
subject, and reached the point by the flashings of the mind, which, like
those of his eye, were felt, but could not be followed. Upon the whole,
there was in this man something that could create, subvert, or reform ;
an understanding, a spirit, and an eloquence, to summon mankind to
society, or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and to rule the wildness
of free minds with unbounded authority; something that could establish
or overwhelm empire, and strike a blow in the world that should resound
through the universe.”—Grattan.
(a) INFLECTION APPLIED TO INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES.
Interrogatories are of two kinds—the determinate and
indeterminate. The former must be spoken with the down-
ward, and the latter with the upward inflection. Determinate
questions are those which contain within themselves the solu-
tion of the point involved—which do not require an answer ;
or to which, it is assumed, only one answer can be given.
These interrogatories are used principally for rhetorical effect,
as being a more pointed and emphatic way of saying that
which would be less effectively said in a plain affirmative or
negative statement.
The Modern Reader and Speaker, by David Charles Bell,
contains some useful rules in this connection ; in fact, the
first seventy-two pages of this work are invaluable to every
student of Elocution. Rules vi., vii., and viii., under the
.
heading “Exercises on Determinate Inflections,” are
follows :-
“Questions that are indeterminate in their signification
require a rising inflection. Such questions are generally, but

:
“Questions that are determinate in their signification require
a falling inflection. Such questions are usually introduced by
means of pronouns, adverbs, or prepositions, and are not
answerable by yes or no.
“ Questions in apposition require the same inflections.
Questions that are antithetic require opposite inflections.
The interrogative words are sometimes omitted, or an inter-
rogative sentence assumes a declarative form. In these
cases the reader will always attend to the import rather than
to the grammatical structure. The answer to a question is
generally read in a different tone from that in which the
question is asked."
The following selection contains a number of rhetorical
questions : the opening sentence will have a strong downward
turn on “force.” The next two questions can be given with
the upward, because they are incomplete without the speaker's
answer, “No!” The conditional clauses, “ If we wish to be
free," etc., to be spoken with the upward-then a downward
turn on fight”; and the phrase being repeated, the emphasis
is altered, and “must” is inflected strongly downward. The
extraordinary force given to the questions, “Why stand we
here idle ? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would
they have ?” by the downward inflection will be obvious.
The succeeding question can be given with the rising inflec-
tion, because the speaker immediately supplies an answer.
"I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its
purpose be not to force us to submission ? Can gentlemen assign any
other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this
quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and
armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be
meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and to rivet upon
us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging.
And what have we to oppose to them ? Shall we try argument ? Sir,
we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new
to offer upon the subject ? Nothing. We have held the subject up in
every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we

, -we
resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find
which have not been already exhausted ? Let us not, I beseech you, sir,
deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be
done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned,
we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have prostrated our-
selves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest
the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have
been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and
insult; our supplications have been disregarded : and we have been
spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these
things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There
is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to
preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been
so long contending-if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle
in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged
ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall
be obtained, must fight; I repeat it, sir,—we must fight! An
appeal to arms, and to the God of hosts, is all that is left us !
“ They tell us, sir, that we are weak—'unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary!' But when shall we be stronger? Will it be
the next week, or the next year ? Will it be when we are totally
disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house ?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire
the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and
hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies have bound us
hand and foot ? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those
means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three
millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a
country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our
enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles
alone. There is a just Power who presides over the destinies of nations,
and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir,
is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.
Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire
it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but
in submission and slavery. Our chains are forged. Their clanking may
be heard on the plains of Boston. The war is inevitable, and let it
come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the
matter. Gentlemen may cry, 'Peace, Peace!' but there is no peace.
The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are
already in the field! Why stand we here idle ? What is it that gentle-
men wish? What would they have ? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,
as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ? Forbid it,
Almighty Powers! I know not what course others may take ; but as for
me, give me liberty, or give me death!”-Patrick Henry.

Indeterminate questions are those which ask for informa-
tion, which leave the point at issue open—which determine
nothing in themselves, but depend for their completeness
upon the answer to be given. These should be spoken with
the upward inflection upon the accented syllable of the
emphatic word. Examples of both classes of interrogative
sentences will be seen in the following selections. Questions
expressing surprise are spoken with the upward inflection ;
ejaculations of indignation with the downward movement :-
“Wherefore rejoice? What conquests brings he home ?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
You blocks ! you stones ! you worse than senseless things!
Oh, you hard hearts ! you cruel men of Rome!
Knew you not Pompey ? Many a time and oft
Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The live-long day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made a universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire ?
And do you now cull out a holiday,
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood ?
Begone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the Gods to intermit the plagues
That needs must light on this ingratitude !”—Shakespeare.
The following suspensive or inconclusive clauses are to be
spoken with the upward, or continuative inflection; the deter-
minative questions with the downward inflection; the
indeterminate questions, answerable by “yes” or “no," with
the upward inflection :-
Though the earth were to be burnt up; though the trumpet of its
dissolution were sounded; though yon sky were to pass away as a scroll,

and every visible glory which the finger of the Divinity has inscribed on
it were extinguished for ever-an event, so awful to us, and to every
world in our vicinity, by which so many suns would be extinguished, and
so many varied scenes of life and population would rush into forgetful-
ness—what is it in the high scale of the Almighty's workmanship? A
mere shred, which, though scattered into nothing, would leave the
universe one entire scene of greatness and of majesty. Though the
earth and the heavens were to disappear, there are other worlds which
roll afar; the light of other suns shines upon them, and the sky which
mantles them is garnished with other stars. Is it presumption to say
that the moral world extends to these distant and unknown regions ?
that they are occupied with people ? that the charities of home and of
neighbourhood flourish there? that the praises of God are there lifted
up, and His goodness rejoiced in? that there piety has its temples and
its offerings; and the richness of the divine attributes is there felt and
admired by intelligent worshippers ?”—Chalmers.
The first of the following questions to be inflected upward
on “performed”—the other two downward on “what,”
"seen,” and “heard”: the answer to be sustained until the
end :
“Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :
* Hast thou performed my mission which I gave ?
What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard ?'
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere,
• I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
And the wild water lapping on the crag.'
(6) INFLECTION APPLIED TO ANTITHETICAL SENTENCES.
Antithesis, the opposition of two ideas, or two sides-so
to speak—of an idea, the relation between two opposite
sentiments, both of them springing from the same root, or,
in other words, connected with the same line of thought, is
an effective, though in inferior literature a highly artificial,
mode of expression. We not only understand a thing by
what it is, but also by its opposite. An effective antithesis
combines the qualities of condensation, rapid contrast, and
energy.
It should be short, striking, perspicuous, and
decisive. It bespeaks preparation, care and polish. It is
not consistent with loose or straggling sentences. It is
concise contrast. Truth is opposed to error as light is to

a
darkness, but when they are brought into direct contrast, the
truth becomes more clear, the light more intense. Contrast
brings out into greater prominence the peculiar properties of
each ; and contrast, upon a larger scale than mere verbal
antithesis, is the principal means of producing dramatic
effect. The play or contrast of character and passion is the
essence of dramatic effect.
Whately gives the following sentence as an instance of
the combined effect of antithesis and metaphor in producing
increased energy :
-“Words are the counters of wise men
and the money of fools.” He also gives the following speci-
mens of antithesis :- Party is the madness of many for the
gain of a few.” “A proverb is the wisdom of many and the
wit of one.” A true antithesis consists in the opposition not
of mere sounds in words, but of ideas. Many specimens of
pedantic, fanciful, and often purely verbal antitheses could
be extracted from Lyly's Euphues—à book which gave rise to
the term “Euphuism"; many instances of true, material
opposition of ideas are to be found in Bacon's Essays. See
how Bacon explains what truth is by what it is not.
The poems of Pope, are full of antitheses. Take the well-
known line, “To err is human, to forgive divine." The
general rule is that opposition of sense should be rendered
by opposition of inflection in the tones of the voice, and
accordingly the above line would be spoken with the down-
ward slide of the voice upon “err," the upward on the first
syllable of “human,” the upward also upon the second
syllable in “forgive,” and the downward bringing the
sentence to an emphatic close upon the last of “divine." In
this way all the opposition in the sense will be brought out
clearly by the voice.
Sometimes the first part of an antithesis is of so much
more importance, and requires so much greater emphasis,
than the latter part, that the downward inflection is used
first, as in the following verse by Kingsley. The positive

“do" takes the downward, and the negative "dream” the
upward. “Good” and “clever” may be contrasted in the
same way.
“Be good, sweet child, and let who will be clever ;
Do noble things, not dream them all day long;
And so make life, death, and that vast forever
One grand sweet song."
Take also an extract from one of Brougham's speeches :
“ It was the boast of Augustus--it formed part of the glare in which
the perfidies of his earlier years were lost—that he found Rome of brick,
and left it of marble ; but how much nobler will be our sovereign's boast
when we shall have it to say that he found law dear, and left it cheap;
found it a sealed book, left it an open letter; found it the patrimony of
the rich, left it the inheritance of the poor ; found it the two-edged sword
of craft and oppression-left it the staff of honesty, and the shield of
innocence /"
If found be spoken with the downward inflection-left with
the upward, brick with the upward, and marble with the down-
ward, a sufficient idea will be obtained of the proper mode of
speaking the whole of the sentence.
There is a double wealth of meaning in sentences that are
properly spoken, because the manner of speaking implies
more than that which is actually said. The actual statement
which is made becomes more emphatic, because of the silent
but still real meaning which marches alongside of it, and which
is alone made intellectually visible, so to speak, by the inflec-
tion which is given upon a particular word. “They that are
whole need not a physician.” A circumflex inflection on
" whole,” first down and then up, suggests the implication
that the sick do need one. “The quality of mercy is not
strained,” with the same inflection on “strained,” implies
”
that it is gracious and voluntary ; “How beautiful is nature
in her wildest scenes !” with a circumflex on “wild,” first up
!
and then down, implies what must be her beauty in softer,
gentler scenes. In the following further extract from
Brougham's speech, a circumflex down and up on “done"
implies that the work is not done but going on. Again, the

proper order of the inflections in the “grapes” sentence is to
use the falling on "grapes," rising on “thorns,” rising on
“figs," and falling on “thistles," in accordance with the
usual rule that the falling inflection should come last in an
antithetical sentence.
“ After a long interval of various fortune, and filled with vast events,
we are again called to the grand labour of surveying and amending our
laws. For this task it well becomes us to begird ourselves, as the honest
representatives of the people. Despatch and vigour are imperiously
demanded; but that deliberation, too, must not be lost sight of, which
so mighty an enterprise requ When we shall have done the work,
we may fairly challenge the utmost approval of our constituents; for in
none other have they so deep a stake.
“In pursuing the course which I now invite you to enter upon, I avow
that I look for the co-operation of the King's government; and on what
are my hopes founded ? Men gather not grapes from thorns, nor figs
from thistles; but that the vine should no longer yield its wonted fruit-
that the fig-tree should refuse its natural increase---required a miracle
to strike it with barrenness. But whether I have the support of the
Ministers or no, to the House I look, with confident expectation that it
will control them, and assist me; if I go too far, checking my progress;
if I go too fast, abating my speed; but heartily and honestly helping
me, in the best and greatest work which the hands of the law-giver can
undertake. The course is clear before us; the race is glorious to run.
You have the power of sending your name down through all times, illus-
trated by deeds of higher fame and more useful import than ever were
done within these walls. You saw the greatest warrior of the age-
conqueror of Italy-humbler of Germany-terror of the North-you saw
him account all his matchless victories poor, compared with the triumph
which you are now in a condition to win !-saw him contemn the fickle-
ness of Fortune, while, in despite of her, he could pronounce his memor-
able boast— I shall go down to posterity with my code in my hand!'
You have vanquished him in the field; strive now to rival him in the
sacred art of peace! Outstrip him as law-giver, whom, in arms, you
overcame! The lustre of the Regency will be eclipsed by the more solid
and enduring splendour of the Reign. The praise which false
courtiers feigned for our Edwards and Harrys—the Justinians of
their day-will be the just tribute of the wise and the good, to that
monarch under whose sway so mighty an undertaking shall be accom.
plished. Of a truth, sceptres are chiefly to be envied for that they
bestow the power of thus conquering and ruling. To me, much reflect.
ing on these things, it has always seemed a worthier honour to be the
instrument of making you bestir yourselves in this high matter, than to
enjoy all that office can bestow-office of which the patronage would be
irksome incumbrance, the emoluments superfluous to one content, with

the rest of his industrious fellow-citizens, that his own hands minister
to his wants; and as for the power supposed to follow it, I have lived
nearly half a century, and I have learned that power and place may
be severed. But one power I do prize--that of being the advocate of
my countrymen here, and their fellow-labourer elsewhere, in those
things which concern the best interests of mankind. That power, I know
full well, no government can give—no change take away!”-Brougham.
The following are specimens of pointed or antithetical
writing in the description of character, the contrasted charac-
teristics being clearly rendered by opposing inflections of the
voice :-
“Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every
energy of a people who acknowledged no superior, Napoleon con
commenced
his course a stranger by birth and a scholar by charity. With no friend
but his sword, and no fortune but his talents, he rushed into the lists
where rank and genius had arrayed themselves; and competition fled
from him as from the glance of destiny. He knew no motive but in-
terest—he acknowledged no criterion but success—he worshipped no
God but ambition; and with an Eastern devotion he knelt at the altar
of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he did not
profess, there was no opinion he did not promulgate; in the hope of
a dynasty, he upheld the Crescent; for the sake of a divorce he bowed
before the Cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he became the adopted child
of the republic; and with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both
of the crown and the tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism.
A professed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot, he
impoverished the country; and, under the name of Brutus, he grasped
without remorse, and wore without shame, the diadem of the Casars!
Through this pantomine of his policy, fortune played the clown to
his caprices. At his touch crowns crumbled, beggars reigned, systems
vanished, the wildest theories took the colour of his whims; and all that
was venerable, and all that was novel, changed places with the rapidity
of a drama. Even apparent defeat assumed the appearance of victory-
his flight from Egypt confirmed his destiny-ruin itself only elevated him
to empire. But if his fortune was great, his genius was transcendent;
decision flashed upon his counsels; and it was the same to decide and
to perform. To inferior intellects, his combinations appeared perfectly
impossible, his plans perfectly impracticable ; but in his hands, simplicity
marked their development, and success vindicated their adoption. His
person partook of the character of his mind; if the one never yielded in
the Cabinet, the other never bent in the field. Nature had no obstacles
that he did not surmount, space no opposition that he did not spurn;
and whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or polar snows, he
seemed proof against peril and empowered with ubiquity. The whole
continent of Europe trembled at beholding the audacity of his designs
and the miracle of their execution,

“ Kings may learn from him that their safest study, as well as their
noblest, is the interest of the people ; the people are taught by him that
there is despotism, however endous, against which they have not
a resource ; and to those who would rise upon the ruins of both, he
is a living lesson, that if ambition can raise them from the lowest station,
it can also prostrate them from the highest.”—Phillips.
The contrasted meanings in the speech of Brutus, in
Shakespeare's Julius Cæsar commencing :
“ Romans,
Countrymen, and Lovers ;” and ending “When it shall
,
please my country to need my death,” acquire great clearness
and significance by opposing inflections, the downward as a
rule coming last. “Not that I loved Cæsar less, but that I
loved Rome more,” “Cæsar less” strongly inflected up-
ward.
« Rome more
" the opposite.
(e) IMPLIED MEANING.
Implied, referential, or indirect meaning depends upon
the circumstances in which it is spoken, and derives its
point and power from the expressive tones of the voice.
Irony is assuming something to be correct for the purpose
of demonstrating its inaccuracy. To the two works men-
tioned by Whately as specimens of irony-his own Historic
Doubts and Burke's Defence of Natural Society-may perhaps
be added Defoe's The Shortest Way with the Dissenters.
Ironical sentences are those which say one thing and mean
another, and they depend for their point in speaking upon
circumflex inflections of voice, that is, a combination of the
the upward and downward movements.
The emphatic words in sarcastic passages should be
spoken with the circumflex inflection. Sarcasm
may
be
defined as irony made broad and strong with feeling : but with
feeling controlled, so as not to become mere denunciation.
(d) IMPLICATION AS AN ORATORICAL FORCE.
Oratory is effective as much in what is implied as in what
is actually said. Mark Antony's oration in Shakespeare's
Julius Cæsar is magnificent in the breadth and force of its

It then goes
implied meanings. The continued reference to Brutus as an
honourable man, side by side with a growing but silent
suggestion to the contrary, until the audience is ready for
the
open denunciation of Brutus and his friends as traitors-
the suggestion to mutiny and rage made more forcible by
seeming deprecation—the searching reference to the “private
griefs ” of Brutus and his friends, and the “reasons" with
which they "no doubt” will answer--the extraordinary
significance of the closing sentences, especially that which
would be developed by a long circumflex inflection upon the
word “stones ”—all these points must be obvious to the
student. Mark Antony's oration is a model of form, besides
containing all the elements of oratorical force. In form it
begins with an exordium, in which the subject of the speech
or the object of the speaker is broadly stated.
into detailed argumentation, and draws inferences from facts,
something is stated as a fact, or something assumed upon
which both sides would be agreed, the argument consisting
in the inferences drawn from the fact or the assumption.
As an elocutionary exercise the speech may be studied
with especial attention to the long combined inflections as
bringing out the implied meanings.
Professor Plumptre says: “In regard to a simple rising
inflection, the beginning, relatively to the end, is low; of a
simple falling inflection, it is relatively high. It is to be
noticed, too, that the inflection always begins on the accented
syllable, which is thus pitched, it may be said, comparatively
low for a rising, high for a falling inflection ; and that the
rise or fall is continued directly upward or downward from
the accented syllable through whatever number of secondarily
accented syllables may follow.”
The student who wishes to understand more fully this
most important and fascinating part of the subject should
master Bell, Plumptre, De Pradel's edition of the Abbé
Thibout's Action Cratoire, &c., published in 1846; The

6.-Emphasis, Expression, Accent, Pause,
Poise, and Climax.
Nothing distinguishes between the thinking speaker and
the speaker who merely “recites," more clearly than the
employment of emphasis-the lighting up or shading off of
words. The man who says-
“ Hail to thee, blithe spirit !
Bird thou never wort,"
is either an "absent-minded beggar" in Elocution, or a hope-
,
less and impossible “outsider.”
“ The boy stood on the burning deck;” “ Once upon a
midnight dreary; “ The sun came up upon the left,” are
peculiarities of emphasis not confined to National School
children and misguided heirophants of the Penny Reading,
or they would have passed into the ewigkeit with those
respectable institutions. There can be no question that the
“sing-song” style of reading and recitation in vogue as
recently as ten years ago in elementary schools was respon-
sible for many vicious habits of false emphasis; but if you
would understand what gigantic strides reform in this direc-
tion has made, study Recitation : A Handbook for Teachers in
Public Elementary Schools, by Arthur Burrell, M.A., London :
Griffith, Farren, Okeden & Welsh ; a book dedicated, “with
sympathy and respect, to all teachers in Elementary Schools.”
Nor do I recommend Mr. Burrell's book for this reason
chiefly; it is a veritable store-house of practical and sugges-
tive specimens of elocutionary craftsmanship, always sensible,
never dogmatic, and refreshingly free from the "clap-trap
that disfigures certain works in fashion just now
among the superficial and dilletanté,

Let us be quite clear upon this point. Emphasis is the
widest word we have yet employed. No formula quite covers
it. I can give you no prescription for emphasis. It embraces
I .
all the potentialities of the voice-from the most forcibly
articulated whisper, to the profoundest depths of the orotund
-all the powers of gesticulation, from the raising of a hand
to the shiver of a hinted sob—all the wide scope of possible
action, from the nod of the sleeper to the death-paroxysm of
a devil-haunted Mathias. The elements of emphasis are to
be found through the whole gamut of elocutionary possibili-
ties. See what David Bell says upon the subject, so far as
emphasis consists in giving prominence to words, clauses, or
sentences, in contra-distinction to others-expressed or under-
stood-by means of the voice. He points out the mistake
that is often made of supposing that stress, or force, is the
only means for conveying verbal distinction ; whereas force
is very limited in its scope for purposes of emphasis, seeing
that words may be rendered prominent, or emphatic, by
several specific modes, or by a combination of them.
One of the greatest charms of cultured and beautiful
speech consists in the delicate handling of emphasis-the
coyest, most suggestive, elusive, and tasteful element of
this exquisite art. The power of satisfactory emphasis is
always the work of mind and soul, acting through and upon
the voice, face, and body; its most potent exercise is a subtle
revelation of personality-a vulgar man will always blunder
somewhere in the region of false emphasis ; a young well-
bred child or educated woman never. I did not dare to
question French dramatic art until a sufficient familiarity with
the language opened my eyes and ears to the fact that even
a pupil of Got and Coquelin sometimes contracts a melo-
dramatic trick of meretricious emphasis. Americans are sad
offenders in this matter; their over-emphasis is frequently
offensive.
Legouvé formulates two rules in his works, which he

calls the rule obvious and the rule not obvious. The
latter relates to the “ Mot de Valeur," word of
prime importance in a sentence. He writes: “Speaking
of the theatre Talma says, “There is, in every well-
constructed rôle, a verse, a cry, or a word, which sums
up the spirit of the entire part ;' and in the same way we
may regard each sentence as having some particular key-
word which, when accentuated, sheds a beam of light over
all the others, and brings out clearly the author's meaning.
This search for the Mot de Valeur,' or word of special
importance in each sentence, requires one to thoroughly ma:
the sense of the passage. As an illustration of this I read
in Fénélon, 'It is not natural to be always using gesture in
speaking; one should move one's because one is
animated, but should not move them in order to appear
animated !' What is the key-word in this sentence? It is
'appear. For what does Fénélon want to prove ? That the
gestures of an orator are only good on condition of being
sincere, that is to say, in accordance with his real feelings.
Well, accentuate the word 'appear,' and immediately the
idea of the author becomes perfectly obvious.
multiply the examples : I prefer to leave you the trouble and the
I
pleasure of finding them yourself. For there is no task more
interesting and more profitable. This hunting for the key-
word gives you the eyes of a lynx in searching all the corners
of the sentence, and compels you to study closely the thought
of the author, to weigh all his words.” And again : “Nothing
avails so much as personal observation in the study of the
art of reading. What springs from yourself is as superior
to what can be implanted in you by others as a shrub in the
earth is to a plant in a jar. Listen attentively to someone
who is relating an incident of which he has been a witness ;
then give, afterwards, equal attention to the same person
expressing a reflection or a sentiment. The principal charac-
ter of narrative speech is truth; the reader must by his manner

of delivery, bring before his audience the reality of the fact.
They must feel that it has actually happened.”
Coquelin says : “You must yourself see what you are
relating ; for in order to put before the eyes of your audience
the action of the story, it is first necessary that it should
have passed before your own. (Note : Coquelin does not say
it is nece
ecessary that it should be passing before your own at
the moment of delivery.) Suppose that you have a story to
tell : let your eye seem to see the things that you are nar-
rating, and the public will follow your words with breathless
interest." Again : “ Then thoroughly understand your
subject-see your drama ; afterwards pull it to pieces- cut
it up. The preliminary statement stops here, the action
begins ; farther on there is a pause in the movement like the
end of an act, after which the drama is resumed, more full of
life and movement than ever. Mark well all these points.
They are necessary in the distribution of the movement. It
is thanks to them that you sustain the interest, and that in
allowing your audience to take breath at the right moment,
you take breath yourself." He might have said--physically
and psychologically. Dupont-Vernon writes : “A thing that
it is necessary to say and repeat incessantly to the pupil is
this : the first thing to do before delivering it, is to decom-
pose the piece that you have to repeat into as many different
parts as it appears to you to contain different movements,"
and, yet again, Legouvé : “To learn how to read a passage
is to learn how to judge it. The study of the intonations
becomes necessarily the study of the meaning. One can only
communicate thoroughly an author's thoughts after penetra-
ting them profoundly, and again they become so much the
more possessed by the effort to express them. There are
hidden beauties which only reveal themselves to one who
wishes to translate them into sound, and the voice throws a
new light upon them by which they are better seen. This
exercise is also an assistance in discovering any hitherto

m
unperceived defects. Such a passage which has fascinated,
or some expression which has dazzled you, appears ranting
or false by this crucial test. To read the poets to oneself is
to become their acquaintance, to read them aloud their in-
timate friend."
The golden rule, then, as to the application of emphasis,
is—understand your author. By this means, and by this
means only can you hope to distinguish between important
and unimportant words-words that have a greater or less
share in conveying the author's meaning, specialised by the
force with which they should be uttered. Emphasis gives
balance and unity to the words that go to form a sentence ;
it has the power to make long, complex and involved sen-
tences perspicuous and intelligible; but it can only be artistic-
ally employed when the full meaning and exact construction
of every sentence is fully and sympathetically understood.
Without this pellucid appreciation, this intimate acquaintance,
it is impossible to give words their just inflections, the voice
its appropriate modulations, the features their illustrative play
of expression, or the various means of making emphasis which
are at the disposal of the cultured actor, their direction and
due scope. Loose, false, or lacking emphasis, means lack of
study, lack of intelligence, lack of psychological grip, all of
which take refuge in monotony-the child of stupidity, by
ignorance. The judicious employment of any given form of
emphasis can only be the last result of close attention and
long-continued practice, and in reading at sight it is scarcely
ever attained. In extemporaneous speech we seldom fail to
express ourselves with emphasis and discretion, or to place
the emphasis correctly, because we perfectly understand what
we are going to say.
Emphasis is in speech what shadow is in painting. Never
fall into the mistake of supposing that it is necessarily a
definite or definable quantity ; that there must be a word in
a sentence that calls for its employment, or even that it can

always be conveyed by the voice. Some sentences need no
emphasis ; in others, one word, two words, or even the
whole sentences must be emphasised. Sometimes it is best
conveyed by a whisper, a gesture, a rising inflection, a pause,
a look accompanying a monotone. Men who excel in mono-
logue, like Coquelin and the late Marius; comedians, like
Coquelin cadet, and the late Corney Grain ; reciters, like
Clifford Harrison and the late Samuel Brandram-furnish the
best illustrations of the judicious and artistic employment of
emphasis in its infinitely various forms.
* While accent is the stress laid upon a syllable in a word,
and is governed by a fixed or mechanical law of pronuncia-
tion, elocutionary emphasis is the stress laid upon a word in
a sentence, or a clause in a series of clauses, or a sentence in
a series of sentences. Emphasis is governed by purely
rhetorical considerations—that is, the general sense of the
sentence itself. Of course, the emphasis is most strongly
heard upon the accented syllable of the word, but, in propor-
tion, all the syllables of the word are forcibly spoken. The
object of emphasis is to bring into prominence and draw
particular attention to the most important words in a sen-
tence, or the most important sentence in a series of sentences.
Words are made emphatic by a change in the tone of voice-
by being spoken with greater deliberation, or with greater
effort, and by a slight pause before and sometimes after.
Leading terms should always be emphasized. For instance-
a sentence is divided into two parts,—(1) its subject, and (2)
that which is said about its subject.
a
“Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability."
The word “studies " expresses the subject of the foregoing
sentence-it is the basis on which it is founded ; it may the re-
fore be considered the leading term, and strongly emphasized.
* Ohlson's Outlines of the Art of Elocution.

115
The qualifying words which follow should also be brought
into prominence. In some sentences the qualifying words-
adjectives and adverbs—are most important, and should be
emphasized accordingly, as the judgment of the reader may
direct. For instance-in praising a woman for her singing,
we say emphatically what she does, but most emphatically
how she does it ; we lay the greater stress upon the adverb,
and say she sings SWEETLY.
The proper placing of emphasis is essential to good and
intelligent reading. The object of reading is to bring out
clearly the sense of the author, and by the manner of reading
to express or imply a command and due appreciation of that
meaning. Improper emphasis not only obscures, but very
often completely distorts the meaning of a sentence. An idea
of the importance of emphasis in determining the exact mean-
ing of a sentence may be obtained by speaking the words
"my book is torn" with an alteration of emphasis each time.
If my is made emphatic, you mean that it is your book, and
not the book of anybody else. A stress on book will single
out that particular article as being damaged. If anybody
disputes the fact, you reiterate with emphasis, “my book is
torn.” And if you wish to bring out clearly what particular
damage is done, you emphasize torn---that is, the book has
not been burnt, or destroyed in any other way, but it has been
And by thus altering the emphasis, four distinct and
important modifications of the meaning are effected.
Besides the above rule as to subjects and objects of sen-
tences, it may be laid down as a general rule, all words
expressive of comparison or antithesis-all words implying or
expressing a distinction between different things or qualities,
should be made emphatic; also words that give a technical
character to a sentence, such words as "why," " is," " what,"
etc., that make it interrogatory-or "if," "should," "so,"
"
"suppose," "such," etc., that make it conditional ; also
exclamations or ejaculations. When a phrase is repeated for

rhetorical effect, the emphasis should be altered, with, of
course, due regard to rhythm.
“Come back! Come back! Horatius!”
“None but the brave, none but the brave,
None but the brave, deserve the fair."
“ Half a league, half a league, half a league onward."
See also notes on Climax, or Cumulative Emphasis.
In the following extract, strong emphasis must be placed
upon the word—“suppose"-which determines the supposi-
tive or conditional character of the sentences, so as to main-
tain the thread of the argument unbroken. It may be left to
the student to distinguish the most important words on which
the argument depends. In the closing sentences the impor-
tance of “is it improbable," and the two similar constructions,
is manifest.
“Suppose, then, the world we live in to have had a Creator; suppose
it to appear from the predominant aim and tendency of the provisions and
contrivances observable in the universe, that the Deity, when he formed
it, consulted for the happiness of His sensitive creation ; suppose the
disposition which dictated this counsel to continue; suppose a part of
the creation to have received faculties from their Maker, by which they
are capable of rendering a moral obedience to His will, and of voluntarily
pursuing any end for which He has designed them; suppose the Creator
to intend for these, His rational and accountable agents, a second state
of existence, in which their situation will be regulated by their behaviour
in the first state, by which supposition (and by no other) the objection
to the Divine government in not putting a difference between the good
and the bad, and the inconsistency of this confusion with the care and
benevolence discoverable in the works of the Deity, are done away.
Suppose it to be of the utmost importance to the subjects of this dispen-
sation to know what is intended for them; that is, suppose the knowledge
of it to be highly conducive to the happiness of the species—a purpose
which so many provisions of nature are calculated to promote. Suppose,
nevertheless, almost the whole race, either by the imperfection of their
faculties, the misfortune of their situation, or by the loss of some prior
revelation, to want this knowledge, and not to be likely, without the aid
of a new revelation to attain it: under these circumstances, is it impro-
bable that a revelation should be made ? Is it incredible that God
should interpose for such a purpose ? Suppose Him to design for man-
kind a future state, is it unlikely that He should acquaint them with
it?”—Paley.

(a) EXPRESSION.
Expression is a form of emphasis in speech that has been
described as “word-painting.” Some speakers have the
power of importing more expression into what they say than
others, and there is a sense, of course, in which speech itself
may be regarded as a form of expression. In the elocution-
ary sense, the term is used to describe realism in speech, and
realism is a very high form of art which is generally arrived
at by study, observation, and practice. Expression is
impossible until you have memorised your words and
thoroughly grasped your author's meaning, it is a grace that
must be super-added to force and is the direct result of
æsthetic sensibility and artistic personality. It is very much
to speech what the tenderer tints are to a picture. It
endeavours to show the appeal of the author's thought to you
personally ; it is the point at which individuality asserts itself
in emphasis; it is your judgment, your taste, your discrimina-
tion making themselves felt ; it is the vehicle for conveying
anything you feel, or may have felt or thought, to an
audience; it is manifest in the work of the painter, the
sculptor, the musician, the architect--the master-craftsman in
In the words of Canon Fleming, it is “the power
of throwing all weak parts into the background, and bringing
the strong ones into the foreground. If the words in a
passage which are insignificant are in delivery made signifi-
cant, the expression will be destroyed. But to bring out the
strong points in a passage by the music, magic and witchery
of the voice, while at the same time the smallest word in the
sentence has its value and is distinctly heard—this is
expression." In other words, expression is a charm added to
correctness, the bloom upon the cheek of emphasis ; it is to
speech what style is to composition, the quality which
distinguishes literature from writing. Expression may be
described as the emphasis of feeling, regulated by taste,
suggested and governed by emotion at full play upon a
every art.

cultivated and masterly technique ; it is not strictly necessary
to the sense or accuracy, but is in the highest degree indica-
tive of thought and sentiment.
(6) ACCENT.
David Bell says that without accent, speech would be
merely a succession of syllables delivered in equal time.
Many words in common use are liable to mal-accentuation.
In a matter of taste and agreement, influenced by fashion, the
accents cannot always be logically or analogically placed. In
the case of difficult or doubtful accent, the opinion of the best
orthoëpists, and the practice of the best speakers should be
followed—and the dogmas of pedantry shunned like poison.
*Accent is the stress which is laid upon a syllable, or upon
syllables, in a word. The elements of this stress of accent
are the same as those of the stress of emphasis, viz. : pitch,
loudness, quality, duration. Formerly, accent was extensively
connected with the pitch, the higher tones being called the
acute, and the lower the grave accent. At present, in English
pronunciation it refers mainly to stress. Accent is a very
important part of the system of orthoëpy, which deals with
euphony and pronunciation. The accented syllable, or
syllables, give the word its character, and should be spoken
with greater force, as the most important sound in the word-
the principal sound, indeed, by which the word is recognised.
The English language is composed of such a variety of
materials, and is drawn from such numerous sources, that it
is impossible to lay down any arbitrary rules founded upon
analogy and etymology so long as pronunciation is determined
to a great extent by popular custom. Public convenience
scorns theoretical perfection. We are not guided by any
abstract consideration of the source from whence a word
may be derived, but rather by the ease and convenience with
which it may be spoken, and by the peculiarities of our
* Outlines of the Art of Elocution, -Ohlson.

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
119
a
habits of speech, which may arise from racial or other causes.
Accents may be divided into two classes, primary and
secondary : that is there is always one syllable in a word,
however long the word may be, on which the voice falls with
the greatest force and fulness, and in a word of many syllables
a
there must be a secondary emphasis. While convenience of
speech is the great arbiter of pronunciation, there is a
tendency to accentuate the radical, as distinguished from the
accidental part of a word to bring into prominence the root
instead of prefix or suffix. But if this tendency may be formu-
lated into a rule, there are many important exceptions to it.
It may be laid down as a general rule that in accordance
with the genius of the language, nouns and adjectives of two
or three syllables should be accented on the first, and that, if
any doubt as to the proper accentuation of a word arises, it
would be the safer plan to give the stress as early as possible
in the word, this being the favourite accent of the language.
With regard to the mode in which the accentuation of words
is rendered by the voice. In speaking the accented syllables
with proper force, care must be taken to avoid the prevalent
mistake of omitting to sound the unaccented syllables at all,
or slurring them. It is true that the accent falls in many cases
upon the most characteristic part of the word, but it cannot
be too strongly insisted upon that the complete articulation of
every sound and syllable of a word is essential to its being
recognized and its meaning understood by those to whom it
is addressed.
Words of two or three syllables are accented, as a rule,
on the first, words of four syllables on the first and third.
Smart says, words of four syllables, with the following ter-
minations, are accented on the antepenultimate, that is, the
third from the end : strophe-catastrophe; logy-apology ;
graphy-geography; meter-barometer ; vorous-carni-
vorous ; gonal-diagonal; fluent-mellifluent ;
cracy,
aristocracy; gony-cosmogony ; machy-logomachy; pathy

-antipathy ; phony--symphony; tomy-anatomy; rious-
notorious.
Different accents often distinguish between the same word
being used as substantive or verb. The following are some of
the words, for instance, that when used as substantives or
adjectives are accented on the first, and as verbs on the
second syllable :-present, absent, accent, attribute, concert,
consort, contest, converse, essay, object, produce, rebel. In
the same way August the month is distinguished from the
adjective “august;” and “conjure,” to practice magic, from
"conjure,” to entreat.
In those compound words where the prefix expressly
distinguishes the meaning of the word from its opposite, the
prefix must be strongly accented. “Neither justice nor in-
justice—the prefix in accented-has anything to do with the
present question.” "His riches must increase or decrease.”
Metre is the characteristic of poetry as distinguished from
prose.
An attention, therefore, to musical cadence is essential
to the proper reading of poetry. Each line is composed of a
certain number of syllables ; these are again distributed into
feet, or arranged in such a way as to produce an alternation
of light and heavy sounds.
The most popular line, perhaps, in English poetry is that
which is commonly called the heroic, containing five feet or
ten syllables. This is the line in which the great bulk of
English poetry has been written, and it is used by
Shakespeare in his plays.
The first object in rendering poetry, as in prose, is, of
course, to make the sense clear by rhetorical emphasis, and
this emphasis must coincide as far as possible with the
metrical arrangement, so that the sense may not only be
apparent, but the manner in which it is expressed musically
effective. Exclusive attention to rhythm produces sing-song,
and brings into too great prominence small unemphatic
words; but correct pronunciation, rhythmical cadence, and

I 21
intelligent emphasis combined, are necessary to the effective
and beautiful rendering of poetry.
There are three kinds of stress or weight of voice that
have to be observed in rendering poetry. 1. Grammatical
accent or correct pronunciation, by which words are recog-
nized. 2. Rhythmical accent, giving the pleasure arising
from cadence and harmony. 3. Rhetorical emphasis, by
which the relation of words to each other is shown, and the
meaning effectively rendered.
Measure is essential to poetry. Not so rhyme and
literation, though often adding to its beauty and effect.
When Marlowe first popularised the swing and freedom of
blank verse, he professed to scorn the “jigging veins of
rhyming mother wits." Rhyme is the agreement in sound at
the end of lines ; that is, the same vowel sound, but different
consonants, in the last accented syllables of lines.
The rhymes of a sonnet make that kind of verse difficult
to construct; but, when skilfully rhymed, a sonnet is very
beautiful. Milton's sonnet on his blindness is a superb
example of the technical form, in rhyming, of this class of
poem. As some of the rhymes are distant from each other,
they require a special stress of voice on the rhyming syllable
to preserve the connection, or the ear might lose the effect
intended by the recurrence of a particular sound.
The elocutionary rule is to lay the stress of voice on the
accented syllables that make the rhyme. Browning's Pied
Piper of Hamelin, with its effective clash of rhyme, may be
practised with advantage. The Ingoldsby Legends afford
good practice for singling out particular syllables by the
voice to preserve the rhyme. In Hudibras, too, there are
.
many lines that are so loosely constructed as to approach
doggerel, but many, again, are pointed and effective, and
the bright rhymes contribute much to the spirit and effect of
the composition as a whole.
Alliteration, the repetition of the same consonant, without

being essential to poetry, is a great aid to its effect, and
should not be lost by the voice in reading. It is in itself a
kind of rhythm. Alliteration is as old as English poetry
itself, and at one time was its distinguishing characteristic,
before even rhythm or rhyme was applied to the language.
Specimens might be taken from almost every English poet.
See the effect of the repeated s in the first line, and of n
in the second, in the couplet-
“Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near.”
The following are further specimens :-
" And the silken, sad, uncertain
Rustling of each purple curtain.”
“Our dreadful marches to delightful measures."
“Roll on! thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll !”
“ The lustre of the long convolvuluses."
To apply pause (cæsura) in poetry without interfering with
the rhythm or the continuous expression of the sense, but to
assist the rhythm and the sense, requires great care. One of
the greatest tests of good Elocution is the manner in which
pause is varied. Pause in poetry must depend, like rhetorical
punctuation in prose, upon the opportunities offered by the
author's words to group them. The freedom afforded by
blank verse for a long continuous expression of meaning
should be noticed. The voice will be sustained therefore at
the end of the lines, when sense is incomplete, and a pause
generally made. In reading blank verse the accents must be
strongly marked, or it becomes prose, and the pause must be
varied to avoid monotony.
English actors and actresses are not often called upon to
speak poetry, properly so called, at the present time ; but
those who remember T. B. Thalberg as Eros, in The Bride of
Love, by Robert Buchanan, will regret to think that the
opportunities for such displays of elocutionary art are not
of more frequent occurrence.

(c) Pause.
Time intervals in Elocution are governed by rhetorical
pause rather than grammatical punctuation. This latter is
often purely arbitrary, and can never be accepted as a reliable
guide by a speaker who desires to express an author's mean-
ing; it is a clumsy device at best, which fully justifies
Dupont-Vernon's direction : “ Pay no attention to punctua-
tion which would impede the natural movement of the
thought or of the feeling. One of the most serious obstacles
to a good delivery is the punctuation commonly adopted."
“ The rule obvious," writes Legouvé in his work on the
Art of Reading Aloud, “is the rule of punctuation. The
punctuation is, if I may thus express myself, a gesture of the
thought. It adds to the written page a visible commentary.
It sketches out the sentence. It indicates the articulations,
the construction, the movement. He who punctuates rests
himself. Now, do you know what the rule of punctuation is
in the study of reading aloud ? A rule which sums up and
includes all the others.”
I have repeatedly noted the disastrous effects produced
by telling children to observe grammatical punctuation, with-
out regard to the fact that the child does not in the least
understand what it is reading. I have stood in a large
school-room listening to what is called, by courtesy, "the
reading lesson.” Again and again I have been irritated
almost beyond endurance by the parrot-cries of the fatuous
man or woman in charge : “Mind your stops. Speak up.
Mind your stops," and so on, over and over again, as if that
were the be-all and end-all of instruction in the art of reading.
The habit of extemporaneous reading aloud, if I may be
permitted the expression, must be held responsible for the
rapid almost phenomenal, loss of grace in speech observed in
children, directly their so-called “education” commences.
Reading aloud at sight is a grave injustice to these ; types
scattered over a page of paper, marked with a certain number

of arbitrary signs, the exact value of which is usually
unknown to the “teacher” who is “hearing them read,” are
unfamiliar and bewildering things to the child-eye.
tunately for those who act to live, as well as those who live to
act, they are seldom called upon to read at sight, except
perhaps, and very occasionally, at a first rehearsal, when a
stage-manager's expectations are usually modest. The first
section of Recitation, by Arthur Burrell, M.A., contains (p. 20)
some excellent suggestions in this department of our subject.
“ Pause where the sense pauses is a very good working rule ;
but remember that the sense pauses again and again where
there is no hint given of the pause. His method of decom-
posing given passages into as many different sections as they
contain is worthy of careful study. Canon Fleming, too, has
a couple of useful chapters on the pause. Charles John
Plumptre, King's College Lectures, lecture xv., should be
referred to, and David Charles Bell, Modern Reader and
Speaker, section “Rhetorical Punctuation,” is of considerable
value.
Grammatical punctuation is intended to divide a written
composition into sentences, etc., by signs, for the purpose of
marking to the eye the different pauses demanded by sense
and grammatical construction. Rhetorical punctuation may
be said to sub-divide for the understanding and the ear;
regarding pauses only as adjuncts to distinct and expressive
delivery, as a means by which an auditor may apprehend and
enjoy without confusion and without effort.
* Nothing is more exhausting to a speaker, more painful
to an audience, and more detrimental to effective oratory, than
speaking until all the breath is gone, and then stopping to
gasp for more. Pauses must be made much more frequently
than the grammatical punctuation would allow. The distance
between two commas is often too great for the voice to travel
over without stopping, and it is therefore necessary to adopt

>
some plan of pausing without obscuring the sense. Besides
pausing at commas, etc., a system of rhetorical punctuation
should be applied. A sentence may be divided into several
clusters of words, the distinction between which may he marked
by a pause, thus allowing an opportunity of taking breath.
The sentence below illustrates this. It will be observed that
each cluster is composed of the substantive and of the verb
that governs or the adjective that qualifies it, together with the
auxiliary words necessary for grammatical completeness. In
a series of adjectives a pause may be made after each, except
the one that immediately precedes the substantive. The rule
that words are often made emphatic by a pause after them
may also be borne in mind.
Reason-guides a man-to an entire conviction-of the historical
proofs-of the Christian religion."
It will be evident that if pauses are made differently from
those marked in the foregoing sentence, the sense will be

coherence, or break the continuous “run” of the sentence,

audience.

broken up.
(d) Poise.

may
be defined as vocalised pause. It is the balance
of the voice upon a vowel sound, a syllable, or a word, and is
a very effective medium of emphasis in the hands of a cultured
and skilful speaker with a musical voice. A quick sense of
time is necessary to its artistic employment; an undue
appreciation of its value is apt to foster trick and affectation
in speech, as witness the elocutionists who take such masters
as Wilson Barrett and the Rev. Dr. Parker for their models-
that which is an added grace in men of the artistic stature of
those named, becomes a ludicrous mannerism in the majority
of their imitators. Nevertheless, in the subtle art of charming

the ear and moving the soul, poise has a distinct value, and
occupies much the same relation to rhetorical pause as
expression does to vocal emphasis ; it is something that
belongs rather to the coterie of psychological qualities that go
to the production of style than to the department of mechanics
-but it must not be ignored because it is elusive and to a
great degree indefinable. In every art are elements of this
nature-especially in the upper reaches--but the student who
pronounces them "comparatively unimportant,” does so at
his peril, and you who will work on the stage are destined to
discover that in dramatic art, at least, there are no
"unim-
portant” elements, comparative or otherwise.
(e) CLIMAX.
In climax is combined the most forcible application of the
rules governing elocutionary emphasis, whether relating to
modulation of the voice, inflection of words, stress, expression,
accent, pause, or poise.
Remember that in all speech partaking of the nature of
oratory, in all speech-except the inane drivel of the social
imbecile—there is a definite object sought, namely, the pro-
ducing of an impression. The gradations of an argument
lead to a conclusion, irresistible in proportion as the premises
are sound and the reasoning adequate—the details of a verbal
picture grow into a striking story or a grand, cumulative
effect-and as the speaker draws nearer and rearer, step by
step, to that conclusion, the breadth, passion, force of manner,
must correspond in intensity with the expansion and import-
ance of his meaning. A greater body and volume of voice
should be used or suggested, reserves of power should be
hinted at, emphasis should be stronger and deeper, the
expression of the countenance should intensify in its earnest-
ness, the light that burns behind the eyes should be seen, and
the gesture employed should be dominated by a higher
nervousness,

127
A level and monotonous manner does not suit with the
progression there must always be in the expression of
meaning. The interest shown by the speaker should rise
with the increasing interest of his speech. It is a common
fault to allow the voice to decrease in emphasis and energy as
the close of a sentence or a series of sentences is reached,
when the words are really more important in themselves, and
also because of meaning accumulated by the previous words.
*A skilful artist, in painting a picture, arranges his subor-
dinate effects in such a manner as to bring into greater
prominence, and exhibit in a more intense light, the central
point of interest. The reciter should remember this, and not
give each petty detail in violent monotony. He must mix his
colours, throw in light and shade, and arrange each subor-
dinate part in such a way as to bring into bolder relief those
passages which contain the climax of his meaning, the central
group of his picture—the heart of his passion.
The following sentences will illustrate declamatory climax.
it will be noticed how the sense broadens until it can go no
further, or, in other words, how it rises to a certain point,
“ Universal Emancipation,” higher than which it cannot go.
Each recurrence of this phrase-in itself a great rhetorical
effect, because it keeps the main idea of the speech before the
audience in a striking manner—is therefore a climax. But
the last is the most important one, because it is not only
broader in meaning than the sentences which precede it, but
is weighted with all the passion and significance of those
senteiices as well as its own. See also the rising importance
of each“ no matter."

this paper, giving Universal Emancipation !' I speak in the spirit of
the British law, which makes liberty commensurate with and inseparable
from British soil; which proclaims, even to the stranger and sojourner,
the moment he sets his foot upon British earth, that the ground upon
which he treads is holy, and consecrated by the genius of Universal
Emancipation. No matter in what language his doom may have been
pronounced; no matter what complexion, incompatible with freedom,
an Indian or African sun may have burnt upon him; no matter in what
disastrous battle his liberty may have been cloven down; no matter
with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of
slavery ;-the first moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the
altar and the God sink together into the dust ; his soul walks abroad in
her own majesty; his body swells beyond the measure of the chains
that burst from around him ; and he stands-redeemed, regenerated,
and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of Universal Emancipa-
tion.'"-Curran.

A soliloquy is a series of reflections in natural order,
leading to a decision which is in the nature of a climax. The
thoughts are not arranged rhetorically, that is, for making
an impression on an audience, but they are spontaneous, and
in their expression should be without self-consciousness. The
speaker abandons himself to a train of thought, and volun-
tarily presents a picture of what is passing in his mind. A
natural soliloquy, showing the speaker's mind, influencing
to resolution and action, and preserving a proper relation
with the circumstances in which he is represented to be, is the
greatest triumph of the dramatist-and its true expression
rises to the highest level of oratory or of acting. The solilo-
quies of Hamlet (the tragedy of thought) are perhaps the
most perfect of their kind-those of Macbeth (the tragedy of
action) are terrible in their intensity and expression of cha-
racter, and are more directly allied to circumstance and
action. It must not be assumed that climax is always given
with increasing loudness of voice. The tones of the voice are
often more suppressed as intensity increases. Climax may
be given as readily in a whisper as in the loudest declamatory
tones,

7.-Gesture, Facial Expression, etc.
Gesture is only by way of being an integral part of Elocu-
tion proper, seeing that it has no place in reading. As Arthur
Burrell, M.A., points out in his book, Recitation : A Hand-
book for Teachers ; in reading: “You read, and your audience
hears the words, or some of the words. You are allowed to
use all the artifices of voice to which you can lay claim by
nature or by practice ; and your audience may be pleased, or
disgusted, or fired with enthusiasm, or lulled into a happy
slumber. But you are not allowed to wave your arms, or
snap your fingers, or toss about any portion of the human
frame. You are not allowed to look stern, or sentimental, or
tragic; nor is your face to change to faces. The limitations
of the reader are quite distinct; and unless his reading is an
insertion into a speech-in which case it is an appendage to
oratory, and follows, or may follow, oratory's rules--or unless
it is a sermon or a lecture--in which cases it is recitation
helped by written words, and may follow the rules of recita-
tion, or the rules of oratory, or the rules of reading-the
reader remains a reader, and upon his voice alone is he
entitled to rely.”
But gesture, facial expression, and the whole range of
sympathetic elocution are important factors in oratory, in-
creasing in value in the ratio of its approach to the dramatic.
On the threshold of this department of our subject you
will be met with the usual truisms and clap-trap. “The
gesticulator is born, not made." “Studied gesticulation is
generally cramped and restrained, and seldom succeeds in
setting up any magnetic force or establishing any magnetic
affinity between speaker and hearers." “Any certain fixed
rules for gesture cannot be laid down, as so much depends
upon the nerve-power of the speaker.” “It is unworthy of
anyone in earnest to study or practice gesture : such study
makes him stilted, artificial, and unnatural.” “ Persons of

a highly-strung nature are for the most part the best elocu-
tionists; to such gesticulation comes naturally," and so on,
ad nauseam. Of course, we are agreed that no amount of
musical education will give a man who is stone deaf a “good
ear.” No amount of instruction or practice will create a
power or faculty that is entirely absent; but the ability to use
a power, a faculty, a natural gift, well or ill, forcefully or
weakly, with grace and beauty, or awkwardly, is a thing that
must be learned if it is to be possessed.
No man is born with a perfect command of gesture, any
more than he is born with a perfect command of the organ or
violin. Exquisite music on these instruments is only pro-
duced after lessons, practice, and profound study.--not only
of the instruments themselves, but of the theory of music
generally—and the same is true of gesture. In every depart-
ment of every art, some learn more easily, quicker, more
comprehendingly than others; but nobody learns without
spending time and patient labour in learning, and, fortunately,
nobody excels without learning.
A “fine, nervous mechanism” is undoubtedly an excellent
natural endowment for a gesticulator ; but “ studied gesticu-
lation " is not necessarily “cramped and restrained." Half-
studied gesticulation is apt to be as inartistic as most half-
studied things; and to say that “any certain, fixed rules for
'
gesture cannot be laid down,” is simply not the truth.
careful to be quite definite on this point especially for the
sake of those of you who are destined for the stage. Consult
those who are in a position to speak with authority ; those
who have “been through the mill ” and attained to excellence
in their profession. Read David Bell on the “Expressive
Management of the Body"- Modern Reader and Speaker,

and Lord Chatham ; ponder what Lord Bacon says upon this

question of whether gesture can and needs to be studied
which should set your mind at rest upon the subject—and
you to work with all your best energies and attention.
Canon Fleming puts the matter very concisely when he
says—" The three principal marks of good and correct action
in speaking are-(1) Simplicity, which adheres to nature ;
(2) Correctness, which adapts itself to the words to be
spoken; (3) Grace, as opposed to awkwardness." If this
be so, it is clear that “good and correct action in speaking”
are only to be hoped for as the results of study and practice;
for in every art, simplicity, correctness, and grace, are
acquired by no other means. Repose itself, no less than the
expression of madness, requires study, and of the two is the
more difficult to master. The “ distinction of manner that
Coquelin cadet discovered is possessed by English actors "in
a very high degree,” is greatly due to the studied repose
demanded by the severe taste of educated English audiences;
and repose is as much a department of gesture as the most
electric movement of the character-actor-it is the point at
which all the harmonies of action resolve themselves into
rest.
I shall take it that we are agreed upon the point, and
proceed to offer a few general suggestions which I trust you
will be careful to supplement.

speak by a proper use of gesture, and a sympathetic expression
of face. The whole body, not merely the voice, must speak.
It should be remembered that gesture is subordinate, and
should not be dragged into prominence. An audience must
go away impressed with the beauty and the force of the
thoughts expressed, not with the idea that the speaker was a
good attitudiniser. The true orator should convince the
reason and touch the heart; and one great source of his
power lies in the earnestness which, although not perhaps
expressed in words, is more than implied in his delivery. If
we see that a man is apparently in earnest, that he fully
understands his subject, and appreciates the force of what
he is saying, we are disposed to attach greater importance
to his speech than if his manner were cold and mechanical.
For oratory to be thoroughly effective, an electric current
of sympathy must vibrate between speaker and hearers.
Without this, the exertion of the speaker is painful and
thankless—with this, the argument gathers strength and
volume as it proceeds, until the climax is reached and the
object of the speaker gained.
In reciting and public speaking the most convenient mode
of standing is to keep the left foot well forward and allow the
weight of the body to rest upon it ; the right foot in the rear;
the heel very lightly, if at all, touching the ground. The
simple, emphatic gesture is the downward movement of the
right arm, or both arms, from the shoulder, the elbow being
slightly bent. The pliability of the wrist conduces very much
to graceful gesture. Too much action, especially of a purely
imitative character in describing scenes and actions in a
recitation is to be deprecated. It should be mainly used to
emphasize the most important part of the speech-the con-
clusion of the argument. If the speaker wishes to emphasize
a certain word, he should gradually raise his arm before that
word is reached, so as to be able to give the gesture rapidly
and spontaneously. When the arms are not required, they

133
should be allowed to drop without exertion. If the pupil has
once mastered the simple emphatic gesture, the other kinds
of gesture-referential, argumentative, descriptive, and pas-
sionate—will be comparatively easy of acquirement.
Referential gesture may be given with the open hand, but
an object may often be effectively particularised with the index
finger ; the palm of the hand being downwards, the pointing
finger fairly straight, the others bent slightly downward. In
all kinds of gesture the fingers should be kept close to each
other, and held in a way consistent with the hollow of the
hand being shown. The main lines of gesture may be prac-
.
tised in connection with the following verse. During the first
line the right hand can be gradually raised, so as to be level
with the shoulder ; during the second an upward sweep will
be made to indicate “stars” and “ sun." The hand being
thus raised, it is ready for the downward emphatic movement
on “spoke." The left hand can then join in the gesture, and
both hands being raised high at “woke,” the double down-
ward sweep can be given on "done,” the hands not brought
i
down flat, but cutting the air sideways, and arrested in such
a way as to produce a slight rebound :-
“When the Lord created the earth and sea,
The stars and the glorious sun,
The Godhead spoke, and the universe woke,
And the mighty work was done."
In descriptive gesture the dignity and consistency of the
speaker should not be sacrificed by a too close imitation of
descriptive incidents in the course of his speech. Mimicry is
a great power, but most effective when controlled. In Cassius'
speech, when describing Cæsar's fever, he does not put aside
his passion and break the thread of his argument by a close
imitation or mimicry of a sick girl's voice in “Give me some
drink, Titinius."
While in general oratory or declamation, gesture should
be indicative rather than directly imitative, the special

representation of particular passions calls for their actual
embodiment. In dramatic representation, the actor must not
only show in outline the man, but for the time being he must
sink his own individuality as much as possible and appear to
be the man, suffering or rejoicing, as the case may be. And
yet he must not altogether lose his own identity, for in himself,
in his own mental and emotional power, lies the force by
which he illuminates and gives life and point to the character
he plays. The actor must be real and not simply expository.
He must rise above mere declamation to the actual realization
of character and portrayal of passion.
As some one has pointed out, decision in action is more
important even than grace. An ungraceful action “if decided,
will be more effective than the most graceful without de-
cision." The aim of the actor is to combine the two in their
highest degrees. Every emotion and passion has a particular
and appropriate expression in gesture which it is yours to
discover by observation and study of the manner in which
emotions and passions are expressed in real life ; and when
you attempt to represent any passion, inspire yourself with
that secondary kind of feeling which imagination is able to
kindle. In all motions of the limbs be careful that the move-
ment proceeds from the superior part; from the shoulder, not
the elbow ; from the thigh, not the knee ; exercise yourself
in motions of the hand from the wrist to avoid angular and
ungraceful actions.
Note carefully the attitudes and gestures represented by
artists and sculptors. In every town you visit when touring
you will find art galleries ; visit them, use your eyes and your
pencil-if you can sketch. Study the gestures of actors and
orators of distinction ; also the unstudied tricks of gait and
manner of men and women everywhere—from the "man-about-
town” lounging by “The Row," to the housemaid scrubbing
a doorstep. True art in this, as in every other department
of your calling-from the baldest commonplace to the wildest

exaggeration of caricature—is always a revelation of nature.
Let your watchword be “practice, practice, practice !"
Remember that what pleases in one person may be unbecom-
ing, absurd, or feeble in another. What is effective gesture
in Irving was often superb buffoonery in Toole. Allow for
personality ; do not fall into the error of assuming the
“magnificent” manner, if nature has endowed you with the
stature of a Robson, the figure of a Sam Johnson, or the
physique of an Edward Terry. Notice the evolution, modu-
lation, passage and fusion of gesture, particularly in the case
of artists in monologue. The Coquelins, Arthur Roberts, Hare,
Irving and Tree, in certain of their scenes, furnish emphatic
illustrations of the fact that gesture is seldom simple or
single ; it generally fuses into a complex whole. Never lose
sight of the fact that one gesture marks one thought, and
however swift the passage of the thoughts to which you have
to give expression, each complete thought may be illustrated
by its own gesture--but let it be in your own handwriting, so
to speak.
The most useful method of acquiring ease, grace, certainty
and force in gesture I have yet discovered was suggested to
me by a game called “ Dumb Crambo,” I think, or dumb
charades. The exercise my pupils go through is something
like this. I give them a scene, go to the back of the audi-
torium, and with my ears well plugged with cotton-wool,
make them play the scene in a distinct whisper. A similar
exercise consists in writing a scene : such as, a young fellow
in bachelor-lodgings expecting a friend to dinner, who dis-
appoints him at the last moment, leaving him to dine alone.
He is finishing dressing, giving an eye to the table, growing
hungry and impatient at the delay. A telegram arrives ; his
disappointment is keen-especially if the expected guest is
a lady—finally he makes the best of a bad job, and, tucking
his serviette under his chin, proceeds to business. Simple
exercises of this description, done entirely in dumb show, are

legitimate practice, and will do you much good, especially
in making your gestures definite and forcible. You can write
them for yourself, or find them ready-made in abundance in
almost any play worthy the name.
Take the quarrel scene
between Brutus and Cassius, or Mark Antony's oration over
the dead body of Cæsar, or Macbeth's vision of the dagger,
or Othello's great scene in Desdemona's apartment, when he
kills her. Do not speak a line but simply act it—by gesture
and facial expression--and you will find in the course of a few
months' study and work that you have not been wasting your
time. In no department of your craft, whether as speakers
or actors, is art more gratefully recognised or artificiality
more keenly resented.
A golden rule in studying gesture is : Observe all men,
assimilate what is best in the art-method of each, and copy
none in anything that savours of an idiosyncrasy or is
personal to a given individuality.
The reciter should exercise extreme care in the matter of
gesticulation. Legouvé advises amateurs to eschew gesture
entirely, relying only upon the voice for the production of
effects. “One of the first rules to give to the reciter is this,
no gestures. The actor makes a trade of the art of speech,
but the amateur reciter is either a child or
a man who
exercises for a brief interval an art which is not his own, and
his merit, I should say his especial charm, is to not resemble
a professional. There is here a shade, very delicate, but real ;
it is almost an affair of personal dignity.” This is heroic
advice which will find scant favour with English reciters, but it
is worth pondering; as J. Raymond Solly points out, Coquelin
delivers his wonderful monologues with less illustrative gesture
than would be used by most English reciters; and those who
can recall the remarkable performances of the late Samuel
Brandram, M.A., will not fail to remember how little gesture
he employed. Dupont-Vernon urges the reduction of gesture
in recitation to a minimum. "Most pupils imagine that it is

137
awkward to stand still : it is the contrary which is true.
Others imagine that, having easy and supple movements, they
may without harm use a great deal of gesture. It is a great
mistake ; the more one multiplies gestures the more one
renders them insignificant. However graceful they may be,
if they have no raison d'être, if they do not add poetry to the
sentiment, or clearness to the thought, they are bad.”
With respect to the measure of gesture that can be profit-
ably indulged on the stage opinions differ very widely. I
cannot help thinking that much needless confusion has arisen
in the minds of controversialists and critics owing to the fact
that the parties have not been talking about the same thing.
The more or less of “gesture on the stage
" is too wide a
theme to discourse of in general terms. If you are playing
in a third-rate melodrama at the “ Theatre Royal One Lamp,"
at Slocum-in-the-Hole, you are dealing with unreality gone
mad, a sort of dervish-dance of newspaper incidents hung
about an impossible story. The only law I know that comes
into operation respecting gesture in such circumstances is :
make your points, and earn your salary honestly. If you are
playing in a “Great Drury Lane Drama,” in London or the
first-class towns, you are called upon to work in “ black-
and-white," and must "let it go." But if you are helping to
"
interpret a Gay Lord Quex, or a Second Mrs. Tanqueray ;
The Man of Forty, or a Magda, your method will be modified-
gesture included. The nonchalent school of bored nature that
ignores or detests gesture has its partisans, no less than the
"natural" -and frequently inaudible and monotonous-school
in speech. It is a reaction from the exaggerated gesticulation
that accompanied the “barnstorming" style of speech which
has gone out of fashion except in minor theatres in obscure
places where the advent of the “portable” is an event.
Dupont-Vernon says, speaking of Mdme. Arnould-Plessy:
“My admiration for this great actress, for this incompar-
able mistress of the art of speech, is such that I shall never

be able to express it even feebly. Well, Mdme. Arnould-
Plessy scarcely stirred any more in Elmire than in Clorinde,
or in Agrippine. One day, in the third act of l'Aventurière,
which she carried through with bewildering rapidity, she
made-I counted them-two gestures, no more. An actor
du boulevard who happened to be seated beside me in the
theatre could not understand it. • What kind of an actress
is it,' said he to me, that doesn't move?' 'Does she move
you?' I said to him, “Yes, certainly.' Well! my friend,
•
that's the great thing !' Oh, I don't deny the power of a
gesture on the stage! One would be a fool to formulate such
a heresy ; one would have, above all, never to have seen
Frédérick Lemaître, never to have been in a position to
perceive all the meaning that he sometimes put into his most
simple ones. I claim on the contrary that this book (Diseurs
et Comédiens) is nothing but a long pleading in favour of
gesture since I have established that the actor must often
express ideas which are not written, and that he can only do
so by looks and gestures; but I only want to see good
gestures. And do you know on what condition a gesture
can be good ? It is when it is appropriate to the written
ideas and completes them. Do you know when it can be
sublime? It is when it takes the place of ideas not written.
But it is essential that gesture should only be used when
necessary, or at any rate useful.
It is above all necessary
that it should not disturb the spoken language by a disagree-
ment, that it should not weaken its force by attracting the
eye to the detriment of the ear ; it is necessary in a word that
it should be a precious reserve, and that one should only
bring it into action, like every reserve, at the opportune
moment to take the place of words, to sustain the idea, or to
decide by a supreme effort the winning of the battle.”
In this matter of gesture, no less than every other depart-
ment of our subject, study your Shakespeare, and his advice
to his fellow craftsmen : Hamlet, Act iii, Scene 2.

8.-Hygiene of the Voice.
This subject is fully treated by Dr. Gordon Holmes, in his
book on Vocal Physiology and Hygiene, London : J. & A.
Churchill, 7, Great Marlborough Street, W.; and my remarks
under this head must be considered as quoted from various
authorities.
Generally speaking, in relation to the throat, it may safely
be affirmed that “the more it is coddled the more tender it
will become." In a state of fairly good general health, daily
exercise in the fresh air is invaluable to anyone who would
excel in the Art of Elocution. "All bodily exercises that
tend to the improvement of the health will have a correspon-
dent beneficial effect upon the vocal apparatus. All excesses,
however, are injurious. Violent exercise, either of the mus-
cular system, or of the voice in particular, at that period of
youth when, amongst other functional modifications and
changes, the voice is breaking, is to be religiously avoided ;
also after a full meal, or when suffering from cold, or the
least symptom of hoarseness.
Whenever the voice is tired give it rest; when the body
is tired do not use the voice.
The whole question of diet can be simplified by saying
that when the general health is good, the digestion is good,
and that therefore variety of food can be taken with impunity;
but when there is the slightest derangement of the health,
and especially when this results from cold, the greatest
caution must be exercised in diet, for the voice will at once
suffer by sympathy.
“One word only with respect to collars; other things
being equal,- turn down collars are good, stand up collars
are bad; those wearing stiff, unyielding collars are peculiarly
liable to swelling of the cervical glands."
As to the effects of smoking upon the voice the elocutionist
and actor cannot do better than listen to the opinion of
Dr. Shuldham : “The tobacco question is one that requires

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
as much consideration as the subject of suppers, alcohol, or
turn down collars. In the latter part of the eighteenth
century a man was thought to be unsociable who refused to
get intoxicated with his comrades ; moderation in strong
drinks being almost a social vice, and intemperance quite a
virtue. So now-a-days, the man who refuses to blow a
friendly cloud of tobacco with his comrades is almost voted
a churl, and the youth who is unable to smoke cavendish with-
out getting pale in the face, and looking about for a soft spot
to lie down and die in, is hastily condemned a milksop.
This, then, being the state of affairs with regard to smoking,
I feel that I shall touch on dangerous ground; however, as
I write not for the benefit of society at large, but for only a
section of society, namely,--for those who make professional
use of the voice, I shall enter into the subject with a fair
courage. To smoke as most Europeans smoke, is to dry the
tongue and parch the throat, to increase the flow of saliva in
an unnecessary degree, and so weaken the gastric nerves.
These are the evils of European smoking brought about by
using too strong tobacco in stale pipes, or burning the mouth
with dry tobacco in short pipes and cigarettes. The strong
tobacco irritates the gastric nerves, and increases the flow of
saliva ; the dry tobacco irritates the mouth and back of the
throat. Is this a necessary evil? We think not. If the
public speaker or singer cannot live without his tobacco, and
there are some who fancy they shall die without it, the remedy
is simple. Avoid using strong tobacco in stale pipes, and full-
flavoured cigars, for these are nerve depressants ; and avoid
dry, chippy tobacco in short pipe, or cigarette, for this is an
irritant of the mucous membrane of mouth and throat. Smoke
rather a mild, delicate kind, Turkish or Latakia, in bowls to
which are attached long snake-like stems, or still better use
the hookah ; by means of this apparatus the drying and burn-
;
ing effect of light tobacco is taken away, and the nervous
system does not suffer.

“ We are often reminded of the fact that this celebrated
singer, or that great preacher, was never seen, except on the
stage or in the pulpit, without a cigar in his mouth; but these
tobaccophiles had great gifts of song and speech, and their
light shone clearly through their smoke, in spite of their
smoke. Let it be granted that Mario smoked much and often,
and that his voice was exquisitely pure and sweet for a long
period of years; that Malibran smoked cigarettes actually just
before going on the operatic stage and delighting an expectant
audience; that Bellew smoked in his railway carriage on the
days of his public readings; but this should not for one
moment make us lose sight of the fact that tobacco in full
doses is a powerful irritant of the mouth and throat ; and, if
speakers and singers are wise they will take it only on rare
occasions, in a mild form, and through the medium of a long,
cooling stem, wisely filtered by the judicious hookah.”
All gymnastic exercises that tend to develope the muscles
of the chest are good ; but despite the risk of tautology, let it
be again insisted, in strict moderation, excess in this direction
is distinctly detrimental; the pupil is in training as an elocu-
tionist, not as a pugilist or gladiator, therefore let all heavy
dumb-bells and clubs be carefully eschewed, anything over
eight pounds in weight (per pair) is superfluous and may be
injurious to the voice, about two to four pounds (per pair) is
the best average ; let the student exercise gently for about
five to ten minutes with such a pair of dumb-bells, arrayed in
his under-garments, upon rising in the morning ; let this be
followed by a generous sponging with cold, or tepid water
over the whole region of the thorax, or chest, and, if
conscientiously persisted in, much and marked benefit will
result.
Numerous preparations are recommended, of varying
efficacy, in some cases by the testimony of competent and
unbiassed judges, for the purpose of obviating and relieving
that dryness of the throat which I have frequently observed
J

to arise in great measure from the nervousness that
embarrasses so many otherwise good speakers ; on account
of their bulk and solidity, however, such preparations can
seldom be used when most required, viz., during public
discourse. “In addition to the lozenges, etc., of the chemist,
liquorice, sweet mucilages, eggs, nitre, and catechu are
used ; a very small portion of powdered nitre or of catechu
will effectually cleanse the mouth ; when required, a glass of
cold water with a little gum arabic dissolved in it will assist
to keep the organs moist.”
I do not think there is any occasion to caution the actor
against the traditional glass of cold water of the speaker; but
a word of warning may not be out of place to the reader,
reciter, lecturer, or preacher. Dr. Holmes says, “ Notwith-
standing its simplicity, I am inclined to believe that the
sipping of cold water is one of the worst habits that could be
contracted with the object of keeping the voice in good order.
My reasons for arriving at this decision are two. In the first
place, when the throat is dry the wetting power of water is
very slight, because it will scarcely adhere to a parched
mucous membrane. Secondly, if there is congestion of the
throat, as betrayed by a feeling of heat, the effect of a
douche of cold water is ultimately to increase that congestion,
for the blood is only momentarily driven away, and returns
in a few moments, by re-action, in a larger quantity
For these considerations, therefore, I think it advisable that
orators should discard the use of cold water whilst speaking.”
The sipping of cold water during sustained use of the
voice may be likened to dropping cold water on a polished
steel surface that has been heated. It can do no possible
good, and if persisted in will certainly set up active morbid
conditions of the throat. The Sophists of ancient Hellas,
as we learn from Migne's Patrologie Cursus Completus, from
Persius, Martial, and Hieronymus, were in the habit of
sipping demulcent and other liquids while speaking, the chief

9.-Summary of Hints and Facts to be remembered
by the Student.
The power of sustained and forcible utterance depends
not so much upon the amount of air in the lungs, or expended
in the formation of sound, as on the rate of its expenditure;
the aim in speaking, therefore, should be to utilise, or voca-
lise, all the air emitted.
The great foe to distinct articulation is rapidity; the best
friend to distinct articulation is whispering exercise, with
corks between the back teeth, in a large building, and vocal
exercises in pause and poise.
The natural voice is that used in conversation-formed
simply by use, and therefore capable of much modification
and improvement; its register is generally found in the
middle notes of the speaking voice. The orotund voice is
probably the most pleasant and impressive vehicle of speech,
seldom a natural gift, usually a result of education and severe
discipline; a popular and quite false direction for its produc-
tion is to "speak down in the throat."
The falsetto voice should be used only very occasionally,
in the expression of any vehement emotion; it is formed by
contracting the organs of voice production, and by directing
the sound upward and backward. Never fall into the error
of supposing that a speaker is better heard for mere loudness.
The contrary is frequently the case.

Never forget the objects of the Speaker are–First, to be
heard ; Secondly, to be understood ; Thirdly, to be felt.
Carefully avoid stress or emphasis on little unimportant
words-e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, etc.
Shun all affectation and pompousness of manner, all
“mouthing," "spouting," and "
gaseousness.”
In recitation, which should be much practised, stand upon
the fore part of the feet; to fix the limb on the heel gives
rigidity to the body ; throw the shoulders down and back ;
let the chest project beyond the chin ; and the muscles of the
arms and chest be kept lithe and flexible, if it is necessary to
this object, let them be kept in motion ; let there be no
rigidity in any muscle, for, by sympathy, if one is fixed and
rigid, others will be.
It is very important to keep the lungs well filled. Pauses
must be made at frequent intervals and breath taken easily
and quietly, partly through the nostrils. Nasal breathing
warms and filters the air received. The mouth is engaged in
articulation and the formation of consonants. The speaker
wants a more regular and fuller supply of breath than in
ordinary respiration. The voice may be strengthened by
respiratory exercises, or as they have been called, lung gym-
nastics. The lungs should be inflated at their base, and the
breathing should be felt in the lower ribs. The test of correct
breathing is the inflation of the abdomen ; there should not
be simply what is often described as throat breathing. No
belts should be used round the waist, and the manner of
standing should be such as to facilitate a good supply of air.
Inspiration should be easy, full and frequent, and in
rhetorical speaking the whole of the breath issuing from the
mouth should be utilized in the formation of words. Expira-
tion should be slower than inspiration. Clerical sore throat
arises from strongly exerting the voice without frequent
pauses for breathtaking.

*MODULATION.
The tones of voice and rate of movement must be varied
to suit each variety or modification of meaning.
Parenthetical clauses must be marked by a distinct change
in tone.
Tones of voice to be adapted to increasing importance of
meaning as words (or sentences) are spoken, and climax is
reached. Illustrative passages should be modulated to show
their importance. Movement of voice should not be
necessarily slow, but deliberate, allowing of the complete
utterance of a word so that it should be recognised as spoken.
In beginning to speak the voice may be pitched at its natural
level, and then varied as required by meaning.
INFLECTION.
Accented syllable of the principal emphatic word in a
clause should be inflected in such a way as to show the
relation of that clause to others in the same sentence.
Upward inflection in incomplete, suspensive, conditional,
and negative clauses; downward in complete clauses, and
clauses that complete the meaning.
First part of an antithesis generally to be read with up-
ward, second with downward turn of voice. Determinate
questions to be spoken with downward inflection, as contain-
ing both question and answer; indeterminate questions,
asking for information, with upward.
Words, ironical, or of indirect or implied meaning to be
spoken with circumflex inflections.
EMPHASIS.
The following should be emphasised :-
Words that
express the subject of sentence.
Words that qualify same.
Words that suggest distinction, comparison, antithesis,
and important modification of meaning.
* Ohlson's Outlines of the Art of Elocution.


## p. 146 (#158) ############################################

146
ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
Words that determine the particular form of a sentence,
such as interrogative, conditional, etc.
Pause should be frequently made without breaking con-
tinuity of sentence, or separating words (such as the adjective
immediately qualifying substantive, or adverb and verb) that
belong to the same grammatical group.
But each noun or
adjective (except an adjective immediately before noun) in a
series may be marked by slight pause. Many emphatic
words should be followed by a pause-also parentheses.
The suspensive inflection, being used to denote words to
follow, allows of frequent pauses for breath-taking.
Pause should be judiciously distributed in reading poetry,
especially to create variety in blank verse.
Rhythm must be strongly marked in reading poetry.
The rhythmical accent must agree as far as possible with
the grammatical accent, so as to allow of the usual pronoun-
ciation of words. Sing-song to be avoided by a judicious
distribution of the rhetorical emphasis.
The accented syllable in the rhyming word, or the word
itself if a monosyllable, should be spoken with considerable
stress of voice.
GESTURE.
Head well up, shoulders well back, chest forward, left
foot forward, bearing principal weight of speaker's body.
Strength of simple, emphatic, and referential gesture from
shoulder, grace and curve of flexibility of wrist and bend of
elbow. Gesture should not be too frequent or continuous.
It must be prepared for, so that when the emphatic word is
reached, the movement upon that word is immediate and
spontaneous. Gesture should be carefully adapted to cha-
racter of speech, whether declamation, soliloquy, argument,
description, or actual embodiment of character and passion.
The actor should always appear to think, and not to know.
Irving says, “It will be found that the most natural, the
most seemingly accidental effects are obtained when the

147
working of the mind is visible before the tongue gives it
words.”
Talma says,
"The actor must have the art of
thinking before he speaks, and, by introducing pauses, he
appears to meditate upon what he is about to say. But his
physiognomy must correspond with the suspensions of his
voice. His attitude and features must indicate that during
these moments of silence his soul is deeply engaged : without
this, his pauses will seem rather to be the result of defective
memory than a secret of his art. The gesture, the attitude,
and the look, ought to precede the words, as the flash of
lightning precedes the thunder."
EXERCISES FOR DAILY PRACTICE.
When undergoing a thorough discipline, the following is
the programme for the really earnest student.
1. Exercise in opening the mouth. Stand erect, the
head well set back, lips closed ; let the mouth be opened
by a direct, energetic, downward, movement and stretch of
the jaw.
Exercise in inspiration. Close the lips ; slowly and
with composure take a full inspiration, through the nostrils,
,
until (1) the diaphragm is completely depressed, and (2)
the thorax is distended to its fullest capacity ; when this is
the case the breath may be silently expelled through the
nostrils and another inspiration taken as before, as noise-
lessly and easily as possible.
3. Exercise in silent expiration. Close the lips ; take
a full inspiration as before, then part the lips freely and let
the breath be expired through the mouth as a sigh, un-
vocalised.
4. Exercise in vocal expiration. Close the lips ; take
a full inspiration as before, open the mouth and sound one
of the vowel sounds, until the whole of the contained
breath has been expired and vocalized. Repeat this with
each of the vowel sounds.
2.

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
The entire series of exercises is to be repeated three
times at least every day; each of the exercises is to be
repeated about a dozen times, with such intervals between
each repetition as may be found necessary. In addition to
these exercises, recitation, i.e., loud and expressive declama-
tion of emotional passages, should occupy another fifteen to
twenty minutes during the day, divided into sections of about
five to eight minutes each. Again, a couple of hundred lines
of poetry or prose should be read aloud, clearly and intelli-
gently, and in addition an equal number, or more, should be
read in a loud whisper. An agreeable exercise is for two or
three students to read together, and, while one reads aloud,
the others to follow him in a clearly articulated, loud whisper.
The foregoing breathing and vowel exercises expand the
lungs, and, by promoting the airation of the blood, exhilarate
the body.

The man who has ability needs no incentive to work, he
only requires direction ; the man who has genius is heavily
handicapped. Let your mere “forthright craftsmanship"
be so conscientiously done that your genius, when it
has an opportunity of displaying itself, may be so disciplined
as to do justice to itself.
Remember that even ability, much less genius, can never
afford to be out of training-ask a pianist, a violinist, a
painter if this is true. Genius must be trained and kept in
training. Genius that is untrained or out of training is a
delusion and a snare. I was present at some athletic sports.
An amateur and a professional—an expert-were competing
in the long jump ; the amateur carried off the prize. Why?
The amateur was the pink of perfection as regards condition ;
the professional was out of training. The moral is obvious.
The elocutionist who is out of training has no business to
appear in public—especially if he is a genius.

SECTION III.
A few Practical Hints on " Make-up.”
It is astonishing that this very important branch of the
actor's art does not boast a text-book worthy the name.
There is a trifling brochure in existence, entitled How to
“ Make-up," a guide for "amateurs, etc.," written by
'
“Haresfoot and Rouge,” in the days apparently, when these
primitive tools were the stock-in-trade of the craftsman. It
was copyrighted in 1877, and appears to have been revised,
by the young man who has charge of the “make-up" stock,
in Samuel French's shop; it possesses an antiquarian value,
deals with the subject from a pre-historic point of view,
contains forty-six pages, including some fearful and wonderful
plates, and two pages and a half on grease paints-of which
one page and a half is mere catalogue.
Now, considering that grease paints are used almost
entirely by men and increasingly by women on the stage, one
page in a treatise of forty-eight can hardly be regarded as an
extravagant amount of space to devote to their description
and discussion in a work on “make-up" that professes to be
“ Practical Guide ”-whether for " amateurs or "etc.,"
particularly if the etcetera is to be taken to include those who
are not amateurs. On the first page of this curious treatise
we are told that“ Professionals, by long experience, and from
hints obtained from one another, are, as a rule, well ac-
quainted with the art ;” and this, with one or two passing
references—as, for instance, a cursory remark upon the ad-
visability of his seeing that his dressing-case, or “make-up”
box is amply supplied with pins, needles, hair-pins, and black
a

and white cotton-is all that this “ Practical Guide " has
to suggest to the professional actor.
Nor do the “ Ladies” fare much better. They are dis-
missed in two pages and a half, all told-of which the first
half-page is devoted to pointing out that any advice to them
on the subject of improving their appearance is “simply
useless ”—and two figures of impossible-looking females in
one of the plates.
In view of the extent to which an actor depends, especially
in strongly marked and clearly defined character-parts, upon
his “make-up,” it is simply incomprehensible that this branch
of his art is hardly ever practised outside the dressing-room,
and even there in the most haphazard rule-of-thumb fashion.
“How would you make him up, old man, if you were me ? ”
is a question I have heard put again and again, by a man
standing in front of his glass on the night of a new produc-
tion. He has probably been rehearsing the piece every day
for two or three weeks; he knows his words, more or less,
and his cues perfectly ; every detail of “ business” has been
thought out and carefully weighed ; entrances, exits, crosses
and "points" to be made, are quite familiar-but he has only
the vaguest kind of conception of the appearance of the cha-
racter he is going to depict presently, and sometimes is
undecided at the eleventh hour what he shall wear.
In desperation he picks up some sticks of grease-paint,
smears them over his countenance, dabs on a few patches
crape” hair, covers the whole with fuller's earth for an
old man, or violet power for a juvenile--something happens,
and he dignifies the inartistic mess with the title of a“make-up."
This is not an overdrawn picture of the case. During the
early part of this year, I made it my business to visit an
outlying London theatre, which is occupied most weeks in
the year by travelling companies, on purpose to study the
“make-up” that passes muster among
the
average rank-and-
file craftsmen who are not above taking their wages on

for it.
treasury” day. I saw four pieces, played by as many
companies. Of the pieces, mounting, acting, and dressing,
I will not speak; but the “make-up," taken as a whole, was
a revelation of slovenly squalor.
Women with scraggy
necks, playing "society” ladies in low-cut dresses ; the hills
and dales left in all their native and naked unpicturesqueness.
Men with dirty hands, and faces caked with “No. 272,"
that ceased suddenly at the line of the lower jaw ; one
impossible Jew, with a badly-coloured lump of nose-paste,
and a mask of unworked black "o crape” hair round his fac
made me sad-spirit-gum is cheap, and he had laid it on
freely ; it shone through the "crape” hair as if he had upset
“
a can of varnish over his countenance, tried to mop it
up
with
black cotton-wool, and some had dried on. Everything
crude, hard, elementary, inartistic—and there was no excuse
No actor or actress has any business to appear before
the public badly made up.
If ever one of you should be guilty of going on the stage
looking “not a bit like it," give yourself no quarter. A bad
“make-up," at least, is a thing you can avoid ; it is your
concern, your fault, and yours alone. The author may have
written you a bad part; the "management” may have pro-
vided you with inadequate scenery, furniture, or effects ;
nature may have denied you a suitable voice, and poverty
may have made it impossible for you to dress the part really
well--but you, and you alone, are responsible for the “make-
up,” that need not be bad and ought to be perfect, and simple
commercial honesty demands that you should make it so.
Let me counsel those of you who are entering this profes-
sion to practise making up the face, at least an hour every
day. Master the art principles that underlie“ make-up,” and
then work at it earnestly, conscientiously, and constantly,
until you have learned to paint any picture you like upon your
countenance. Nothing will repay you better ; for I have
known men, over and over again, engaged by managers

simply because they have “ looked like” certain parts in
which at some time those managers have seen them play.
“Haresfoot and Rouge " says that undoubtedly the most
difficult branch of the art of making-up is that of altering the
features of a young man in such a manner as to represent the
different stages of life, and that characters such as Romeo,
Bassanio, Charles Surface, etc., require but little making-up.
“All that is necessary is to powder the face and throat well
with Pearl or Violet Powder. Then with a hare's foot apply
a
a colouring of Rouge to the cheeks, keeping it well up on
the cheekbones and under the eyes, in order to give them
a brilliant and sparkling appearance. To add to the effect,
a little may also be placed under the eyebrows, taking care,
however, not to let any get on the eyelids, as in that case the
eyes would have the appearance of old age or of sorrow.
Also put just the faintest possible tinge on the chin, to
brighten and throw up the complexion. Lastly, with a fine
camel's-hair brush, paint a thin Burnt Umber line under the
lower eyelashes . . . This, if done with great care and nicety,
imparts to the eyes a brilliancy and darkness that are highly
effective; but if, on the other hand, it is carelessly or in the
least over-done, the effect is highly ludicrous.
brows are naturally full nothing need be done to them. If
otherwise, all that is necessary is to touch them up slightly
with cosmetique. The make-up' for this class of character
is then complete."
This statement proceeds upon the assumption that juvenile
parts are necessarily played by juveniles, and is entirely
misleading. The fact is, that quite young men are seldom
to be trusted to play perfectly “straight" juveniles ; and it
frequently happens that such parts are given to men of forty
years of age and over. It is not until a man has mastered
the elements of his art, and obtained something like control
of his powers and a knowledge of his resources, that he is
fit to interpret leading juvenile parts.

“juveniles" on the stage at the present time worth naming.
Five years ago who were the best straight “juvenile” men
on the English stage? William Terriss, George Alexander,
Wilson Barrett, Forbes Robertson, Charles Warner, Henry
Neville-grandfathers, some of them-but, where are the
young men ?
Again, these instructions presuppose uniformity of com-
plexion and feature. Suppose a man has a very sallow skin
and he powders it well “with pearl or violet powder," what
sort of ghastly effect do you suppose this treatment would
produce ?
A florid man
can afford to use these dead-white
powders on his face, very sparingly; a man with a pale com-
plexion, never. Or let a man with a tip-tilted nose and wide
open nostrils try the treatment; the result would be ludicrous,
for the whiteness would emphasise the size of the nostril
openings and the heaven-seeking tendency of the feature.
Broadly speaking, the reverse of this statement is true and
the instructions are quite wrong. Nothing is easier than the
adding of age and character; nothing requires so much care,
such delicacy of handling and lightness of touch as clean,
straight, interesting juvenility. If the face is young and
fairly good-looking to start with, the danger is that pearl-
powder and rouge will certainly make it too “pretty" to be
at all interesting, and take from it every vestige of force and
character-without which any face looks like a barber's block.
If the face is not young or quite regular, the slap-dash treat-
ment will give the poorest possible results ; in any case the
“make-up” is difficult, and calls for the utmost care. The face
of comparative youth is so exposed ; there is no kindly
"crape" hair-which covers a multitude of blemishes, includ-
ing nervousness-no lines, no network of wrinkles, no bushy
eyebrows, no seams, or shadow's, or scars to hide the work-
ings of the countenance, or screen the irregular features from
the scrutiny of the most observant; all must be clean, fresh,
open and brilliant, reserve is almost impossible.
a

The rule is, the less there is to put on the more care and
judgment must be exercised in the manipulation ; the heavier
the “make-up" the easier it is-other things being equal-
to get a satisfactory effect.
The great underlying principle to be borne in mind is that
a shadow depresses and a light elevates. Do you wish to give
prominence to the nose ? Put some light colour on it. Do
you desire hollow cheeks ? Rub some antimony, or dark
grey colour into the centres. Ladies know all about this ;
many of them will not wear white shoes, simply because they
make the feet appear larger. A black sash round the waist
reduces its size to the eye, a white sash increases it. See two
men made up for age; each has, roughly speaking, as many
lines as the other, placed in about the same positions, yet one
looks flat and unconvincing while the other looks natural and
full of character. Inspect the faces closely and you will see
that one man has "lighted up” his wrinkles well, by placing
lines of light colour above and below each wrinkle, thus
depressing it, and the other has not.
Do not be misled by the common misuse of the word
"artistic" in relation to a “make-up." ” I have heard men
in the dressing room and elsewhere speak of so-and-so as
having "an artistic 'make-up'” when they really meant some-
thing quite different. The word as applied to "make-up"
denotes a result that produces the most vivid impression of
the character depicted--the most telling effect--whereas the
word is often used to mean something pretty, picturesque or
attractive. Art in "make-up" is simply inherent effectiveness
--suggestiveness and intelligibility.
If you observe carefully, I think you will discover, what,
for want of a better word, I may describe as a colour-scheme
in the “make-up” of every actor or actress of distinction.
Beerbohm Tree, with his curious blend of the lymphatic and
sanguineous temperaments, strikes the note of red in "make-
up," red deepening to purple, as shown in his Demetrius,

Macari, Falstaff and King John. Irving, a man of purely
nervous' temperament, is the grey wehr-wolf of the stage,
grey toning to green, as witness his Eugene Aram, Mathias,
Louis, and King Arthur. Hare, who is the embodiment of
the modernity of the moment, suggests sepia in "make-up,''
sepia toning to chrome or ochre, as his impersonations in
The Money Spinner, A Pair of Spectacles and The Gay Lord
Quex will prove. Barrett, who stands for the spirit of impet-
uous downrightness, colours in the pink of robust sensual
life, as shown in Claudian, Frank Thornhill, Marcus Superbus,
and his flesh-and-blood Hamlet. This may seem fanciful to
you, but if it starts you thinking and observing for yourselves
I have no objection to your labelling it anything you please.
Consider the sleek 16 make-up” realized by Kemble and
Charles Hawtrey; the black-and-white facial sketches of
Arthur Roberts, Charles Brookfield and Bassett Roe ; the
sardonic grimness of the pictures Charles W. Somerset paints
upon his mobile features; the miniature-paintings of Alfred
Bishop; the Hogarthian method of Tom and Fred Thorne,
Shiel Barry and the late George Barrett; the studies
reminiscent of William Quiller Orchardson to which Wynd-
ham has accustomed us; the Phil May drawings of Albert
Chevalier ; the classic cameo-work of Barrett, Compton,
Willard, and Thalberg ; the handling suggestive of “ Phiz”
and Cruikshank that distinguishes the "make-up" of Edward
Terry, Penley, Martin Harvey, the Grossmiths, Cyril
Maude, and Mackintosh. Do you suppose that these things
happen by accident, or are effects produced by natural endow-
ment? It is not so; they are the outcome of intelligent
study, long practice and careful observation. Some of these
men I have watched at their work, not once but many times ;
the patience, the intelligence, the deftness acquired by long
and wide experience, are what have struck me most about them,
and account for much of that “ distinction " that characterises
English actors which struck Coquelin cadet so forcibly.

Those who are never tired of comparing the English with
the French stage--to the detriment of the former- would do
well to consider this matter in detail. Mrs. Kendal is
reported as saying, speaking of gesture : “With us it is more
art than nature ; with the French it is more nature than art,”
and I have heard the same sort of thing respecting the
depiction of passion, and "make-up." With the French these
things may be “more nature than art"_but it is French
nature, French passion, French appearance. On the English
stage you will see more human nature, human passion, more
humanity generally in a month than you will on the French
stage in a year. The bismuth and carmine of their actresses
may give startling and artistic results--if art can ever be
allowed to startle—but, they are purely French, nay, purely
Parisian. I suggest, certain notable critics notwithstanding,
that the English school of acting is more natural, broader,
more catholic than the French, and is, therefore, higher art, and
in nothing does this manifest itself more than in “make-up.”
Coquelin cadet says that English actors "possess the gift
of being infinitely distinguished”; well, no one could truth-
fully bring that charge against French actors, as a class.
“There is no doubt that as a natural gift the majority of your
actors possess distinction of appearance and manner in a very
high degree, in a degree rarely seen in France.” The reasons
are not far to seek. Modern forms of republican government
are seldom good to Art, and in France the best men of histrionic
instinct are taken hold of by the Church, you will find them
in the pulpit, in England they gravitate to the stage. In
France not one distinguished actor in fifty knows how to
make the best of his personal appearance ; France is Parisian;
insular, and parochial in her ideas, far more so than England,
and anything that does not smack of Paris bewilders an actor,
he does not know how to make it
up.
Leman Rede's venerable uide to the Stage—which is none
the worse for its age-contains the following :-

Every one on entering the theatre at night, should wash
his face, and after drying it thoroughly, pass lightly a powder
puff over it. This is highly necessary to those whose skin is
naturally greasy." This advice was invaluable in the days
when “dry” materials were used in making up; but the intro-
duction of grease-paints makes it optional whether you wash
your face before leaving for the theatre, or upon arriving there.
My own experience is that it is best to get a clean shave and
good wash about a couple of hours before you begin work.
Vaseline or cocoa-butter is the soap and water of the modern
actor, who should never want the latter while in the theatre
except for his hands. The heaviest "make-up” can be easily
removed by means of cocoa-butter and a soft towel, and
when you reach home a good wash in hot water with an
emollient soap is far better for the skin than rubbing it with
cold water and the skin-removing compounds supplied as
soap” to London theatres. The slight film of grease left on
the face after rubbing off the paint and spirit-gum with cocoa-
butter, fills the pores and keeps them safe while you pass
through the night air, and so prevents chaps, roughness and
other evils.
You will be well advised to follow the almost universal
practice and use grease-paints as the groundwork of every
"make-up." Let no false ideas of economy induce you to buy
anything but the best quality goods; the difference in price is
trifling, in effect startling, and in result, so far as the skin
and even the health is concerned, well worth consideration.
MATERIAL:
Cheap “make-up” is a grave mistake from every point of
view. Get Leichner's grease-paints, and don't be persuaded
to try any of the substitutes that are offered as cheaper or
superior. The reasons which should induce you
to use
grease-paints are many, and nothing can be urged against
them as compared with anything else. They are convenient;
K

easy of application ; uniform in results, and, when once you
have mastered their use, will enable you to "make-up” in
less time than anything else. Perspiration does not affect
them, even when it comes through, and the colours do not
run or fade to an appreciable extent. A grease-paint "make-
up” may safely be trusted to stand the wear and tear of
the heaviest night's work; it can always be brightened up
with a little powder and Rouge de Théâtre applied during the
evening, and can be removed or modified without difficulty,
and last but not least, its action upon the skin is positively
beneficial, instead of being deleterious as is the case with a
“dry make-up," which usually contains lead.
Almost every shade you will require can be found in
Leichner's selection, and as you gain experience you will learn
to do wonders with a very few sticks. I have been astounded
sometimes in watching an artistic character-actor at work
before his glass to see what modest materials he has required
for the production of the most remarkable results.
Two or
three stumpy pieces of grease-paint ; a few remnants of lining
sticks; a dilapidated powder-puff and hare's-foot that have
seen better days; the remains of a pennyworth each of white
hard varnish, fuller's earth, violet powder, Armenian bole and
vaseline; and a few odds and ends of “
crape” hair-these
are his stock-in-trade of materials, the deft fingers, trained
eye, and artistic sense have done the rest.
You will have little use for anything lighter than No. 27%
in grease-paints—unless you are a lady, in which case No.

1/2 and 2 will be useful, if carefully employed, for lighting-
up wrinkles, and giving prominence to the nose, forehead,
chin, cheekbones, etc. Have all your materials in front of
you before you begin work. Wig, spirit-gum, “crape"
hair, curling-tongs, grease-paints, vaseline or cocoa butter,
lining-sticks, two or three small camel-hair brushes, a couple
of small saucers, a little water in a bottle, Armenian bole in
a tin box, hare's-foot, powder-puff, violet powder, pink face-
powder, fuller's earth, brush and comb, and a couple of soft
towels. Such are the things you will usually require ; make
a note of anything special and see that it is lying on your
dressing-table before you make a commencement.
Understand clearly that colour is absolutely necessary on
the stage; without it the most florid face appears white, and
a pale complexion assumes a greenish, ghastly hue, un-
pleasant to look upon. Under-colouring usually distinguishes
the beginner, just as over-colouring often betrays the veteran
whose eyesight is failing. I remember my own first “make-
up”; it was for a clean juvenile, and after spending much
time and care upon it, I succeeded in getting something that
looked remarkably pretty-in the dressing-room glass. After
the performance I asked a “candid friend” who was " in
front,” what he thought of it. “You looked horribly nervous,
.
old man ; you were as white as a sheet,” was the disconcert-
ing reply. I have often been amused at the theorisings of
beginners upon the subject of “make-up," and have heard
ladies who were blessed by nature with good complexions,
etc., declare that "make-up” was totally unnecessary in their
case, that they wanted to be “natural," and so forth. It has
not taken them long to discover that they are not paid to be
natural, but to appear natural, which is a very different thing.
No one can appear natural by being natural on the stage.
The conditions are entirely artificial, from the arrangement of
the lights to the abnormal psychological conditions under
which the players are called upon to do their work. In this

connection, the strictly "natural" is the ineffectual, and
entirely unpicturesque. Your business on the stage is to
represent-not to experience. If representation to an audi-
ence involves or demands that you shall experience what
you represent, that is your affair. Now this principle finds
an application in the matter of “make-up." Why was my
first attempt in this direction a failure ? Because I did not
know how to allow for the artificial conditions—the flood of
light, the distance at which I was working in the eyes of the
audience, etc. In order to appear natural or normal on the
stage you must use colour, and the measure of your skill in
the use and disposition of colour will be the measure of your
artistic success in “make-up.”
In preparing to put on a “make-up” it is well to dress to the
shoulders ; do not put on collar, tie, or coat ; throw a towel
lightly over the shoulders, and wash the face with a little
vaseline or cocoa-butter—which should be wiped off as far as
possible with a soft towel.
Put on your wig if it has a "join," first smearing the
forehead with some of your complexion colour. This is done
by taking it firmly between the forefinger and thumb of each
hand by the spring at the back, catching the "join" just above
your eyebrows, to give you purchase, and drawing the wig
backward and downward until it sits well into the neck,
covering your own hair and giving the right height of forehead.
Some men stick the “join” down to the forehead with spirit-
gum, this is only necessary when the wig is a bad one, and
does not fit. Colour in your “join” with the complexion
colour you are using, until at three yards from your glass it
is practically indistinguishable. Rub the paint well into the
“join,” toning it off carefully with the fingers into the roots of
the hair, which should be cleared nightly with a small toothed
comb, before beginning operations. Spare no pains in getting
a good “join," and if the wig-maker has rendered it impossible,
by sending you a wig that does not fit properly, do not spare

him. I have often seen an otherwise good “make-up” spoiled
by a bad “join,” and have noticed that some of the most
experienced men are the worst offenders in this particular.
Next, put on your complexion-this, of course, is your
first step after the cocoa-butter wash and dry-off, if your wig
has no “join,” or you are wearing your own hair-anything
between Nos. 27/2 and 4, according to the character. Powder-
costume pieces-e.g. Old Comedies, etc.-demand a lighter
and brighter make-up generally than others. To do this
satisfactorily, take your stick of paint and smear it on cheeks,
forehead, and chin, work it well over the face with the second
finger of each hand, using as little paint as possible to completely
cover, and taking care to work it off the edges of the face
under the jaw, chin, ears, etc., until it vanishes into the colour
of the neck-otherwise you will simply be wearing a mask.
Do not paint the neck but see that the complexion of the face
merges into the natural colour of the neck. I saw, not long
ago, an earnest young actor in The Gay Lord Quex wearing
a heavy mask of No. 272, that fitted definitely round the jaw
and chin ; the effect was as inartistic as that produced by
Gilbert Hare, who gave Sir Chichester Frayne such a com-
plexion of No. 2 or 2% and rouge as no man of his age ever
brought back from the West Coast of Africa.
In cold weather it will be necessary to warm the grease-
paint slightly; this may be done by holding it over the gas
for a few seconds, but care must be used as it is easily over-
done. Common grease-paints harden much more readily
than those of better quality.
Ladies will, of course, please themselves about using
grease-paints ; I strongly advise them to do so, but if they
prefer Crême Impératrice they will doubtless use it, find it
pleasant, and feel convinced that it is in every way superior
to grease-paint. I have sometimes ventured to warn them
against using Blanc de Perles on the face to “heighten the
effect of the Rouge"-as the compilers of lists of "make-up"

the eyes.

-but not often, for they soon learn that Pierrettes
are not in universal demand on the English stage.
Having painted in your groundwork, your next care is the
colouring of the cheeks. Take your stick of vermilion, or
red-of which there are several shades-and rub a little well
up on the cheek-bones. Work it in gently with the second
finger of the right hand until it blends with the flesh colour;
be particular to leave no edges, and not to drag it too low
down towards the jaw, or too near the nose or under-lid of
A very little of this colour applied immediately
under the eyebrows imparts great brilliancy to the eyes, but
the utmost delicacy of touch is necessary here, as the least
suggestion of red on the eyelids is disastrous ; a hint of the
same colour on the chin in a juvenile “make-up” is useful, and
the lobes of the ears should also be slightly coloured. Under
ordinary circumstances this completes the complexion.
Your attention should next be turned to the eyes and eye-
brows. If juvenility of appearance is sought, the matter is
simple, though not necessarily easy. The darkening of the
eyelashes makes light coloured eyes appear darker, the light-
ening of the eyelashes reduces the darkness of the eyes.
Generally speaking, nothing adds more to the effect of the
eyes than darkening the lashes and nothing is more easily
overdone. There are various methods of making-up the eyes,
some prefer one and some another; you must experiment for
yourselves, and by repeated trials discover which suits you
best, then practise it until you are quite dexterous in its
employment. Ladies have a trick of slightly heating a hair-
pin, digging out a small quantity of black grease-paint, and
working it on to the eyelashes while it is soft. I have only
seen one man do this successfully, but ladies produce some
remarkable effects by these simple means. A plan I have
found satisfactory is to take a small tin box, such as is used
for wax vestas, put in it a piece of black grease-paint about
half an inch long, melt it over the gas and when melted

apply to the lashes, after powdering the face, with a small
artist's tool of soft bristles ; before powdering take a camel-
hair brush, dip it in the melted colour, squeeze it to a chisel-
edge, and draw a line from the inside of each eye, below the
lower lashes, outward and slightly downward at the outside
corner ; if it is desired to lengthen the eye, or to impart
added lustre and beauty, paint a black line from the point at
which the lashes finish on the top lid outward, following the
curve of the roots of the lashes—this line may be a quarter of
an inch in length, and should vanish rather than finish. Do
not be afraid to use the tips of the little fingers freely in this
"make-up;” they are the best tools, when you know how to use
them, and you should not allow any initial clumsiness in their
use to dishearten you. As you become more expert you may
try various delicate experiments, some of which will probably
give you good results. For instance: remarkable brilliancy
may be produced by painting a thin line of crimson lake and
bright scarlet mixed, immediately under the edge of the lower
lid, and a soft line of black and brown, mixed, below that to
represent the lower lashes—the under side of the black line
drawn below the lower lashes should always vanish, it must
never be definite. The colour of the eyes may be much
altered by painting a line of the colour it is intended to
suggest above the upper and below the lower lashes, care
being taken not to touch the lashes themselves ; I have known
hazel eyes to appear blue, and blue eyes to suggest brown
when treated in this manner. I have seen Fred Thorne, I
think it was, enlarge the whites of his eyes by painting a
white line, crescent shaped, under the lower lid, and below
that a dark line to suggest the lashes. Those who witnessed
his performance in Confusion will not forget the wonderful
saucer-eyes he made at Miss Kate Phillips. The late Fred
Leslie did wonders in the make-up of his eyes, as those who
saw him in Rip van Winkle, and Little Jack Sheppard, Ruy
Blas, and Monte Cristo will remember. Julian Cross,

the use and “make-up” of the eye, and, of course, you will
examine as carefully as glasses will permit the manipulation
of this feature by such past-masters as Irving, Hare, Beer-
bohm Tree, Barrett, Roberts, Willard, Leno, Wyndham,
and Penley. Some of the finest examples I remember among
ladies of cleverly managed eyes are Miss Genevieve

King Lear; Bangs, as Marc Antony ; the late David James,
as Blueskin; and Murray Carson, as Napoleon, stand out as
having vividly impressed me with the fact that nothing pays
better for care and artistic handling in “make-up” than the
eye-except, perhaps, the hand.
In continuing your “make-up," the eyebrows are next
treated. The natural eyebrows of an ordinary-looking man
are usually too wide to appear interesting as items of
furniture in a juvenile countenance. This is easily remedied.

paint the rest with black, or any colour that best harmonises
with the “make-up”; be very careful not to overdo this, and
do not finish abruptly at the outer ends.
Touch the lips lightly with carmine lip-salve ; do not
exaggerate the size of the mouth, or make the outline too
sharp ; carry the central points of the top lip slightly upward,
and be careful that they balance.
If any modifications of feature have to be made, now is
the time to make them. Is the chin too square? You can
give it point by shading it on either side with a neutral-grey,
or Armenian-bole lining stick, and putting a high light, of
No. 172 or 2, on the centre of the lower portion. A receding
chin may be given prominence by painting a shadow under
the lower lip and adding a high light, increasing in strength,
below it. Is the chin too pointed? You can give it breadth
by painting a portion of the lower jaw on either side of it with
a high light, outlining the enlarged edition by means of slight
shadows on the adjacent territory. Other portions of the
face—as the nose, ears, cheekbones, forehead—may be
modified on similar principles, and with artistic effect if the
simple axiom be borne in mind that a shadow depresses and
a light elevates.
You are now ready for the finishing touches.
With a
large puff powder the face all over with violet powder if the
make-up” will stand a crude white, or with a pink face-
powder if you desire greater delicacy of effect. If the latter
is employed, be careful of the quality of the powder ; many
cheap pink powders change colour when acted upon by per-
spiration, and some fly on contact with grease-paint, giving
the "make-up" a dirty appearance. Powder well down over
”
the neck and throat, dabbing the whole "make-up" thoroughly.
Then take a hare's-foot foot and lightly dust off all superfluous
powder, especially round the eyes, eyebrows, and root of the
nose. A little Rouge de Théâtre-Dorin, Paris-may be
applied to the cheek bones with the heel of a hare's-foot, and

the eyelashes and eyebrows brushed out lightly with mascaro
-or water-colour paint; these finishing touches will brighten
the "make-up " immensely and give it piquancy.
A golden rule with a “make-up” is : once finished, let it
alone. Do not attempt to add or alter by means of grease-
paint. After powdering, any modification is to be made with
water-colour and a camel-hair brush-but it is best left alone
altogether. What is not done before powdering you will
seldom succeed in doing afterwards. This, of course, does
not apply when alterations are demanded during the progress
of the play.
More actors spoil the effect of an otherwise artistic “make-
up” by neglecting to treat the hands than in any other way.
Having finished the face and head including the hair, however
treated and worn, before rolling down the shirt sleeves,
attend to the hands. After careful washing put a few drops
of glycerine and rosewater into the palms and work well over
the backs, dry as thoroughly as possible on a soft towel. If
naturally very white, dust over with violet powder, well rub it
in, clean round the roots of the nails and clear the nails them-
selves. If the hands show signs of age or are not naturally
white, after the wash work in about twenty drops of liquid
Blanc de Perles, and finish with violet powder, etc., as
directed. Understand that nothing shows age--not merely
the number of years a man has lived-character, disposition,
the influence of emotion, even the habit of thought, more
readily or certainly than the appearance, tricks and move-
ments of the hands. I went to see a man play an import-
ant part on a first night, not knowing the character he was
to sustain. A few minutes after the curtain had rung up a
group of six or eight persons entered ; nothing suggested the
man I had specially come to see, until I saw one who had not
spoken make a trifling movement with the left hand ;
instantly I knew my man-slight as it was, the action was a
characteristic trick. Shiel Barry, Irving, Beerbohm Tree,

C. W. Somerset, Franklin McLeay, and a host of men I have
watched, have trusted their well-drilled, perfectly made-up
hands with an immense amount of work, and have had to
thank them for some of their finest touches of art. In
character “make-up,” of which I hope to speak in a future
lecture, the hands may be trusted for almost any effect if
adequately and artistically treated. The fingers may be made
to look long and thin, or thick and flat; the knuckles may be
brought into prominence; the tendons made to stand out ;
the veins emphasised; virtue and benevolence, or vice and
malevolence may be suggested by the appearance and use of
these wonderful members—but everything depends upon
delicate manipulation and an intelligent appreciation of the
principles which underlie the artistic arrangement of light and
shade. If the hands are made up be sure that the treatment
extends at least as far as the wrist, and that the materials
employed are so applied as not to soil the costume of any
ladies with whom you are working.
If the character you are representing is a juvenile wearing
hair on the face, you will probably be tempted to cultivate
your own. This is nearly always a mistake. A natural
moustache, for instance, is usually too thick or heavy to look
well on the stage. Then the tendency to darken it strikes
out any picturesque possibilities it may have originally pos-
sessed, "and to paint it with grease-paint of the required
shade, and then finish it with a light powder," as one
"authority" on the art of making-up recommends, is indeed
to “finish it” from an artistic point of view. A moustache
so treated looks dead, wooden, and unnatural. To darken
it “by painting it with black or brown mascaro, or water
cosmetique, according to the effect desired," as he directs in
another place, is very risky. I have seen an excellent “make-
up”completely spoiled, and the face rendered ludicrous by the
mascaro-blackened moustache of an actor becoming moistened
during his work. If the part demands a moustache, and be

quite sure it does before you decide to wear one, make it
yourself. Never be persuaded into buying any of the mon-
strous hirsute appendages mounted on gauze, wire, etc.,
manufactured by wig-makers. They are merely a concession
to laziness and incompetency; unless in the case of an
extremely heavy character “make-up," or such broad carica-
ture as farcial comedy or burlesque admits.
Nothing challenges dexterity in “make-up” more than this
matter of putting hair on the face. I know this is contro-
versial ground, and that I shall have the serried ranks of
wig-makers—who render incalculable aid in many ways to the
actor—"naturalists,” and lazy actors opposed to me; but,
right or wrong, I distinctly advise you to work your own
artificial hair to suit your own face. With practice, constant
and patient practice, you will certainly get the best results
this
way. A man played in a certain piece some two hundred
times in a London theatre with a lady of keen observation.
One day they met in the street; she did not know him. At
night he told her she had passed him without recognition,
although he had bowed. The explanation was simple ; she
did not know him without a moustache. He had worn one
at rehearsal, shaved it off before the first performance, and
for two hundred nights she had stood face to face with him,
quite close, without suspecting that he was wearing artificial
hair on his face.
To make a good moustache you will require to have a
metal comb with teeth at an equal distance apart throughout.
Take three or four plaits of créped hair of different shades,
and loosen about a couple of inches of each. Hold the comb
in your left hand, teeth upwards, and with the right draw
the lightest shade of hair over the comb in two equal patches
of about an inch and a half wide, almost joining in the middle,
leaving two very slight tufts sticking in the comb; over these
draw the darkest shade but one, increasing the bulk by the
least possible quantity that will influence the shade of the tufts

169
a
in the comb; repeat the operation with the lightest shade but
one, and on top work a very little of the darkest. Draw the
tufts away from the centre, inclining them right and left.
Soap your fingers, after dipping them in thin gum, with
yellow soap, and work the hair through and through them
until it is fairly smooth, thinning and lengthening the outer
ends. When nearly dry, take a pair of heated curling-irons,
not too thin, and curl the two tufts, drawing out the irons to
the right and left respectively. With a pair of long sharp
scissors cut them off close to the comb; they are then ready
for use.
See that the top lip is free from grease-paint ;
powder it slightly, then apply over the surface to be covered
by the roots of the hair, a thin coating of spirit-gum. Do
not be in a hurry ; let the spirit evaporate, which it will do
in about twenty seconds. Take each of the tufts and fix it
exactly, holding it in position until it adheres firmly, by means
of a soft towel or linen rag. It will be better to treat each
side separately, and the operation of fixing will not occupy
more than a minute. When dry you can pinch and trim it
into any shape, etc., you desire; and if you touch it in slightly
at the top roots with a camel-hair brush filled with blue or
Armenian-bole, water colour, the effect will be excellent.
This may sound like taking a great deal of trouble ; so it is,
at first, but as you acquire skill by practice, you will find it
easy, and the effects that you will obtain will more than repay
you.
For characters of maturer age you will possibly require
more hair about the face, but it can all be applied on similar
lines far better than any made-up stuff you can buy, and no
amount of trouble you may be called upon to take will be
worth your considering if you succeed in getting the picture
right. No artist thinks anything of the detail-work required
in his calling, provided only he secures the results.
Never be misled by the delusion that a moustache can be
soaped down, glued down and coloured out, smeared out by

means of any so-called “ moustache vanisher ever invented;
these are all clumsy expedients unworthy an artist, unpardon-
able even in an amateur, and an actor should never allow any
consideration of personal vanity to stand in the way of his art.
In the treatise on The Art of Making-up before referred
to, I find the following amazing statement—"Slight mous-
tachios and whiskers may be painted in, and when done skil-
fully they look very natural ;” and the pamphlet published
by Samuel French, on The Art of Acting, says : “Indian ink,
applied with a camel's-hair pencil dipped in gum, is sometimes
used." “Haresfoot and Rouge” is discreetly silent on the
”
subject of moustachios, dealing only with eyebrows and
beards, while French's Guide to the Stage gravely assures us
that “the use of burnt cork is a dirty habit, and now
generally abandoned." Of course, you can paint in a "slight
moustache and whiskers,” but I should not advise you to try
the experiment at, say, the “St. James's,” or “ Wyndham's"
”
- that is, if you wish to remain.
Do not forget when deciding upon the colour of a mous-
tache, that in nature it is usually lighter than the hair of the
head ; though this is not always true of the hair on the face,
especially the eyebrows.
The
scope
of this lecture does not admit of our considering
the subject of mature, character, oreccentric “make-up"; at the
same time, a juvenile “make-up' sometimes demands a know-
ledge of lights and shadows. A round, healthy face is some-
times required to appear thin and wan, even in the case of a
young man or woman-as, for instance, Charley Middlewick,
in Our Boys, after Talbot Champneys has nursed him through
his illness, when he is called upon to pose as a pale and inter-
esting invalid. Or the thin countenance, “sickiied o'er with
the pale cast of thought,” of a man of nervous temperament
and studious habits, like Forbes Robertson, may be wanted
to look round, healthy and jocund. Either case calls for a
practical knowledge of the principles that govern the intelli-

gent arrangement of lights and shadows for the production
of given effects; for this is of immense importance in making-
up. By its means the entire character of the face may be
modified without interfering with its actual outline. Not a
single touch of paint can be put on the face without coming
under the rule of these principles,-for every smear of colour
is either a “light” or a “shadow".--relatively considered.
Generally speaking, the effect of a high light is to give
prominence. A shadow reduces prominence. A wrinkle is
simply an intensified shadow, which is deepened if a high light
is placed above and below it. Any colour darker than that
employed as the groundwork of the complexion can be used
for shading. Never use black for this purpose ; Armenian-
bole is best, next to this are crimson lake, vermilion, grey and
blue. Understand that no face, however young, can be in-
teresting that is devoid of light and shade, and mere appear-
ance even in the most juvenile “make-up " should be strictly
subordinated to character. Better have a suggestion of
irregularity and ruggedness than a lack of expression, and
expression depends very largely on light and shade. Never
mask your own face in pink and white for the sake of simply
“looking nice.” Never paint out the face you have unless you
are clear that you can paint in one that is better suited to the
character. Everything must give place to character. Ladies
please note. Dolls, however pretty, are apt to grow monot-
onous, and nothing palls more quickly than mere beauty of
colouring. An ounce of expression is worth a ton of pretti-
ness. I once worked through a stock season of twenty-one
weeks with a lady who played as many leading parts without
once varying her "make-up." She was young, intelligent, and
exceedingly pretty, and consistently declined to sacrifice her
appearance by altering the “prize-doll” –with pink and white
face, rosebud mouth, big blue eyes, well blackened about the
lashes, and delicately pencilled eyebrows—"make-up” she
had learned by experience best suited her particular style of

a
beauty. That is six years ago; I see her at frequent intervals
wandering in the neighbourhood of Bedford Street-she is
always looking for an engagement. There is no moral.
It is inadvisable to paint any given expression on the face
in a juvenile "make-up"; on another occasion I hope to discuss
the desirability of putting expressions on the face in paint at
all, meanwhile, it is easily comprehensible that in the case of a
straight juvenile part a stereotyped expression is a mistake;
but while it is absurd to expect to make one expression
available for the whole of a play, the face may be very lightly
shaded in such a manner as shall materially aid any given
expression when it is assumed, as the late William Terriss
did when playing Squire Thornhill in Olivia—the mouth being
thinned and hardened, lines suggested from the nostrils to
the corners of the mouth, the nostrils lightened to give the
effect of dilation, the top lids of the eyes lightened to help the
half-closed appearance, and the straight eyebrows turned
sharply up at the inside corners, the whole effect giving an
expression of supercilious hauteur to the face expository of
the character.
The forehead is peculiarly susceptible of modification or
emphasis by this light-and-shade method of treatment.
Strength and prominence may be given by a judicious adjust-
ment and distribution of high lights; squareness made
apparent by shading the temples gently, so as to sink them a
trifle, with some warm tint, say of Armenian-bole or madder
carmine ; these shadows should be deeper as they approach
the front, and emphasised by high lights adjoining them on
the forehead itself. You will do well to note this carefully
because the brow is the most neglected feature of the face.
A receding appearance may be imparted to a high square
forehead by shading the upper portion with a grey lining
stick towards the hair and putting a high light over the eye-
brows, and a receding forehead may be remedied by reversing
this treatment.

)
Cheek-bones may easily be too high for an interesting
juvenile face, in which case you will reduce their prominence
by painting high lights above and below them, putting slight
shadows on the cheek-bones themselves. Sometimes strength
and character require emphasising, you may then heighten
these bones by putting high lights on them ; this may be
done without prejudice to the colour, but it requires great
judgment. Redden the cheeks in the ordinary way, then
paint over the cheek-bones with No. 1/2, tone carefully, and
add slight shadows of carmine above and below, which must
be deepest where they reach the bone.
The treatment of the nose for juvenile parts seldom calls
for more than a judicious arrangement of lights and shadows.
Nose-paste should only be used as a last resort, and it is
astonishing how much can be effected without it. A “ tip-
tilted” appearance may be produced by painting a high
light where the cartilage forming the centre joins the top lip,
and shading with carmine or grey immediately beneath the
tip ; a hooked appearance is produced by reversing this light
and shade ; an aquiline appearance by putting a strong high
light on the bridge, and a shadow just above it which
gradually vanishes between the eyebrows. You can lengthen
it by painting a high light from the bridge up towards the
eyebrows, or shorten it by painting a shadow in the same
place.
Whatever modifications of the features are required must
be made before powdering, and should be carried out with
due regard to the fact that high lights are increasingly
emphatic in relation to the general make-up proportionately
with the distance from which they are viewed.
Ladies' juvenile “ make-up” should proceed upon the same
general lines as those suggested for men, the groundwork of
the complexion being lighter, say No. 1% or 2, but much will
depend upon the sort of character to be portrayed. Miami, a
Gipsy, a Spanish woman, or brunette call for a deeper colour-

scheme altogether than a blonde or a London Society woman.
If grease-paint is objected to, let the hair be pinned back and
the face thoroughly washed and dried ; then coat it thinly
with Crême Impératrice, treat the mouth with carmine lip-
salve ; powder with violet-powder, or a good pink powder,
brush off with hare's-foot; line below the lower eyelids with
Fard Indien-black, brown, or blue, or a mixture of either
two; colour the cheeks with Rouge de Théâtre, Dorin,
Paris, applied with the heel of a hare’s-foot and kept well up
on the cheek bones; brush out the eyelashes, and line the eye-
brows very carefully with Mascaro, water cosmetique, black or
brown ; touch the chin with the faintest suggestion of rouge,
also the lobes of the ears, arrange the hair, and the “make-up”
is complete. Treat the hands as directed for men, but dust
over with pink powder after rubbing in the Blanc de Perles.
Before going on the stage be sure your wig is straight,
your “make-up” perfect, your costume properly adjusted and
fastened. I have seen some startling unrehearsed effects pro-
duced by a neglect of this last, very simple injunction.
Never begrudge the utmost expenditure of time, thought
and care in getting a good “make-up." You will never over
estimate its importance and value. More good engagements
could be traced to artistic “make-up" than you might imagine.
Never grow careless in this matter, for, in addition to your
duty to your “management" for the time being, you never
know who is looking at you while you are working. Once,
while playing at an unimportant theatre in a second-class
town, I went down at night feeling quite unlike work—I
had something of a sick headache-made up as usual, with
perhaps a little extra care, for my glass warned me I was
looking “ cheap," played with a sense of effort and went back
to my lodgings with a sense of relief. Next morning I had a
letter offering me what proved the most comfortable engage-
ment I ever had in London. A lady who was producing a
piece happened to be in the theatre overnight, thought I

looked something like what she wanted, and engaged me.
Such instances ould be multiplied indefinitely.
A good rule for an earnest student is to practice a
ro make-
up" with which he is familiar, and a fresh one every day; this
will give him skill and facility, especially if he works from a
photograph or well-executed print. He can never tell when
such practice will stand him in good stead. I remember a
very fine example of Henry Arthur Jones's earlier method, a
melodrama entitled A Noble Vagabond, in which Julian Cross
played an old miser of seventy or eighty, “Old Joe Scorier,"
I think he was called. Charles Warner was playing the
juvenile leading part, and in one scene, to save the heroine-
Miss Dorothy Dene—from a suspicion of murder, old Scorier
had been killed by his son, Ralph-Charles Cartwright—the
hero impersonates the old miser. Warner disappeared into
the miser's hut, and a few minutes later the door was flung
open disclosing Warner looking so like old Scorier that for a
moment the audience was bewildered. It was not only that
the gait, voice, and general appearance exactly reproduced
the character Julian Cross had represented, but the “make-up”
and facial expression were apparently identical. It was the
most perfect triumph in the art of “make up” I have ever
seen, and proclaimed the artist in every touch.
Now it not infrequently happens, especially in melodrama
and farcical comedy, that a juvenile actor is called upon to
assume a character calling for an entirely different "make-up”
-as Babs in Charley's Aunt, and Hawkshaw, in The Ticket
of Leave Man; so that it is extremely unwise to limit the
range of your powers in this direction. When J. B. Mulhol-
land was at Nottingham he once put on a localised version of
The Streets of London, and engaged me to play Paul and
Captain Fairweather, which I have since learned is a usual
double. I had never doubled parts before, and was very glad
of the experience. With my contract came a drawing, done
in ink and tinted, of the Captain, and before a week was out

the work of contrasting the two different “make-ups"
completely fascinated me. Beginners especially will find the
advantage of suppleness in this matter, for it often happens
that even a genius may find himself obliged to double and
treble parts in going round the country, before an apathetic
public will consent to pay to see him play Hamlet.
In estimating the value of a stock season you must reckon
the advantage it offers in giving you the opportunity of trying
your hand at a new “make-up” every week, or oftener; an
advantage that any experienced actor will tell you is not to be
lightly regarded.
Before leaving this subject let me urge upon you to seek
broad effects. It is easy to multiply detail until all strength
and character are lost, even in a straight juvenile "make-up."
I have seen men fidget and finish a "make-up"-good enough
in its earlier stages—until, like certain pictures, it has been
“ finished to death." And, lastly, never fail to have a look at
the theatre in which you are going to work before going on
the stage at night; and be careful to modify your “make-up”
to suit the house. What would look like a perfect specimen
of miniature painting at Terry's, would appear a mere smudge
at Drury Lane ; and a “make-up" that looked warm and
bright where gas was used would appear wan and washy
behind electric light.

It must ever remain a mystery why people—sane people,
who are ready to recognise the necessity for training, appren-
ticeship, tuition, in every other art or craft demanding skilled
labour, yet persistently foster the delusion that the stage is
the one exception. If the business of a man's life is to be
the making of tables and chairs, boots, fire-stoves, pictures,
or music; if he is going to practise medicine, law, soldiering,
sailoring, auctioneering, preaching, engineering--civil, mili-
tary, electrical, naval-or architecture, he is quite prepared
to serve an apprenticeship, be articled, or enter a special
school ; but anyone expects to be able to act, to follow
dramatic art, without having learned anything about it-
without tuition, apprenticeship, or knowledge of the business
of acting. Some go even farther : they are confident in their
own minds (?) that if once they set foot on the stage, an
afflatus would seize them, their dramatic power would assert
itself, and a delighted and bewildered public would hail with
acclamation the advent of another genius. Often these are
persons who have no knowledge of how to speak, walk,
gesticulate, or carry themselves; they regard such things as
of minor importance ! they perceive character, therefore they
can represent it; they experience emotions, therefore they

can express them; they appreciate a dramatic situation, therc-
fore they can realise it to others. It is true that an inspira-
tion often seizes people directly they step before the footlights
--it is usually an inspiration of overwhelming terror, some-
times amounting to panic; always an inspiration of intense
nervousness if the subject is possessed of the merest scintilla
of artistic feeling ; but if anyone expects any sort of helpful
inspiration to come to his aid at the outset of his dramatic
career, he is running a terrible risk of being cruelly disil-
lusioned.
I used to be amazed when novices came to me imagining
that it was the simplest thing in the world to enter the dra-
matic profession; now, I am only amused. Let me give you
a couple of instances. A lady, young, and of prepossessing
appearance, who had taken a dozen lessons in Elocution from
a man who knew practically nothing of the stage or its re-
quirements, came to me with the usual—“I wish to go on
the stage ; I have had some lessons, and my friends all think
I should be an actress." A trial lesson on the stage itself
proved that she was inaudible, wooden, and totally ineffective;
yet at the expiration of two months, during which quite
ordinary progress had been made, the lady was surprised,
and rather indignant, that I would not give her a letter, of
recommendation to Mr. Benson, and astonished that she did
not get an understudy vacancy for which she applied at the
Lyceum. The other case is that of a man holding a trifling
Government appointment. He had distinguished himself
greatly among some amateurs in a northern Suburb of
London, and came to me more as a matter of form than
anything else. It was not altogether convenient for him to visit
agents' offices in the morning, and he assured me that “hunt-
ing managers at night" was such "a beastly fag," would
I “find him something?" At the end of his first lesson he
was offered an engagement for two weeks in London, to walk
on and speak a few lines ; by the courtesy of the stage-

manager I was able to arrange rehearsals to suit the man's
time. A fellow-student congratulated him on his luck ; his
reply was amusing :
“Yes, I suppose it is rather lucky ; but to tell you the
I
truth, I don't apprehend any difficulty in getting engage-
ments. You see, I have done a good deal of this sort of
thing."
Six months later he was affronted because a touring
manager to whom he had been recommended declined to
entertain his application, on the ground that he could not
be bothered with novices.
And, really, when you think of it, it is a little unreasonable
to expect to enter a profession easily in which the risks are all
with the employer; in which people engage you for work you
have never even attempted before, and are asked to pay you
for the privilege of allowing you to make experiments and
enable you to live while you are making them at their expense.
Whose business is it to teach you the rudiments of your
art? The manager ? It is his business to cater for the public
which pays to witness his entertainment, and to see that com-
petent people are entrusted with the work of interpreting the
piece. The stage-manager ? It is his business to direct the work
of craftsmen, not to instruct a pack of novices. He can only
handle the material supplied him, and cannot be expected to
make bricks without straw. He finds quite ork enough in
getting the best available out of people who know their
business, without being bothered with men and women who
know nothing of the art of moving the emotions, making a
picture, emphasising a point, interpreting a character, or
contributing to a situation-in other words, people who do
not know their business. If you knew anything of the
arduousness of a stage-manager's calling you would not be
surprised at his horror of novices. It is difficult enough to
“make a piece go" with the aid of experienced artists, and
why should a stage-manager be expected to teach you your

work ? Especially when you are drawing a salary for work
that you are supposed to be able to do.
Your business on the stage is to represent nature artistic-
ally ; to personify types, characters, eccentricities, and, hardest
of all, mediocrities, under purely artificial conditions ; to assist
in the interpretation of a story, which may be humorous,
pathetic, farcical, or tragic; to subscribe your quota to the
production of a given effect, to bring about certain definite
psychological results; and this business of yours argues the
possession of various requirements.
You must know human nature before you can hope to
represent it artistically. The gaining of this knowledge
entails a constant alertness of observation and reflection, a
perpetual study of the life that surges about you, a quick per-
ception of the tricks and mannerisms that differentiate people
and make for individuality, a retentive memory for pecu-
liarities and outstanding characteristics; the widest and
profoundest possible acquaintance with history and literature,
from the Bible to the modern novel-it goes without the
saying that you should know your Shakespeare, Dickens,
Tennyson, Browning, Scott, Macaulay, Fielding, Bunyan,
Goldsmith, Sheridan, and, above all, the great book of
average contemporary human life as it is lived by men,
women and children about you on every hand. You must
study character from the life before you can hope to personify
it convincingly. You must visit the haunts and make your-
self familiar with the habits, tricks of gesture, peculiarities of
speech, the very play of features of any given character or
type, just as Dickens and Joseph Conrad did for purposes of
imaginative literature. You must track any likely model,
and, if possible, scrape acquaintance with him; and while
mere slavish imitation, or bald mimicry are to be avoided,
characteristics are to be soaked up, exaggerated or modified
to meet the requirements of your particular picture. Very
often a single model will not suffice for your purposes, then

you will study several and endeavour to reproduce such
leading characteristics as are peculiar to the type. Simple
photography will give you but poor and inartistic results,
just as in literature the work of the realistic school, from
Zola downwards, smells of the paste-pot and newspaper
cuttings. The work of Brookfield, Chevalier and Arthur
Roberts will explain what I mean; there probably never was
just such a “coster" as any one of the creature Chevalier
depicts, or such an unholy vagrant as the gentleman who
sang “Round the Town”—but they have been studied from
costermongers and blackguards in great breadths, hence their
artistic value as character studies. All sorts and conditions
of men will furnish forth a rich harvest of models to the man
of "quiet eye.” The streets teem with them. Your living
models throng you, and if you would excel in the art of
personifying them you must study them in the flesh, and
And then the hardest part of your task remains ;
having understood your model, the next thing is to reproduce
him, to personify him so intelligibly that the man in the
audience who is least acquainted with him recognises him
without difficulty and the man to whom he is most familiar is
perfectly satisfied with your picture. Purely specialist or
technical business must be studied from a craftsman in the
particular calling that the character is supposed to follow.
Every trade, business or profession known among men has
its own vocabulary, its own tricks of gesture and movement
that can only be acquired by watching an adept. I do not
know where Willard found the model for his Cyrus Blenkarn
in The Middleman, but somewhere, somewhen he had watched
a potter at work, I feel certain. Look at Dan Leno as a
waiter, a soldier, a very worried over-married man, a shop-
walker, or a railway guard ; look at Ernest Hendrie as a
bovine-visaged country yokel who has spent most of the years
of his life in toiling over rough ploughing, or a dapper straw-
chewing groom redolent of the Park-lane mews, and you will

see superb specimens of such caricatures as only an artist can
turn out who is sufficiently familiar with his models to be able
to let his own individuality and imagination play with them.
Bear in mind that your part is probably little more than a tiny
piece in a mosaic; a character, perhaps, simply necessary to
the telling of a story--but, it is that. Never be guilty of the
unpardonable blunder of stepping out of the picture; every
spot of colour however minute is necessary to the perfecting
of the painter's idea, but the least over-emphasis of detail
draws off the attention from the idea. I have seen some
rank offenders in this particular; men and women who have
deliberately sacrificed the story for the sake of “scoring” in
their own miserable parts. Who that saw The Gay Lord
Quex, at the Globe, could fail to resent the over-emphasis of the
cigarette-smoking ladies in Act III., with their vapid chatter
anent the “style” of French novels. One cannot blame the
ladies for this bit of whitewash-laid-on-with-a-birch-broom-
work, but where was the stage-manager when such a blot
was first allowed to pass? This thrusting of a couple of sub-
ordinate female figures right outside the frame is the sort of
thing that makes the judicious grieve, and men like Coquelin
cadet say : “ I consider your men infinitely superior to your
women.” A still more glaring and pitiful instance was
supplied by the actor who played Pfeiffer in Nurse, at the
same theatre. Here was a character that, as played, was
simply an offensive interruption to the story, and did not
subscribe anything to the production of the generally
ridiculous effect aimed at, the only psychological result
brought about being a feeling of bewildered irritation on the
part of the audience.
Stage“ business” proper includes the whole of the action
of a part. It may be left to a greater or less extent to the
discretion of the artist, if he is thoroughly reliable and ex-
perienced ; more often it is invented by the author, or sug-
gested by the stage-manager ; if the piece is old it is generally

proper
to any given character was simply amazing in its extent
and exactness. You will learn more upon this subject from a
"o crusted actor of " the old school” if you are so lucky
as to meet one, in a single tour than I could tell you in
twenty lectures.
Make an invariable rule of carrying either a fountain pen,
or sharply-pointed lead pencil with you at rehearsal, and of
marking on your part every direction of the stage-manager
at the time it is given. Let this be done carefully and
exactly ; every cross, exit, entrance, gesture, bit of bye-play,
everything in fact that may by the most liberal interpretation
be classed under the head of “business.” This rule will save
you heartaches and headaches innumerable, and your stage-
manager much wear-and-tear of temper. It will sometimes
happen that your business will be altered again and again,
especially in the earlier rehearsals. Take all such alterations
without a word or look-your business is to carry out instruc-
tions, not to argue a point. Never remind a stage-manager
that he told you to do something else at a previous rehearsal,
unless he refers to you pointedly with such a question as :
“Let's see ; what did you do last time ?” Then your
marked part will stand you in good stead and will give your
stage-manager confidence in you. It was my good fortune
to act in the capacity of “ Assistant Stage Manager”—a
polite name for Prompter-under Robert Soutar, during the
production of a farcical comedy and two or three other pieces.
If in doubt as to a certain “bit of business" he would invari-
ably say : “ Just ask Mr., or Miss so-and-so, they are sure
to have got it marked,” and I noticed that such people were
among the best craftsmen on the stage. The slap-dash,
happy-go-lucky individual is of no manner of use to the careful
stage-manager, especially in farcical comedy which is the most

a
exacting form of play he has to handle, because it must be
taken at lightning pace, is frequently entirely dependent
upon “business," and requires the most delicate handling
lest the audience should be allowed for one instant to reflect
upon it seriously, in which case its inconsequence and utter
impossibility would cause their interest to collapse as com-
pletely as a pricked air-balloon. If the copy of the part from
which you are expected to study is supplied you by the
management, you are not expected to deface it. Let your first
care on receiving it be to make your own fair copy on separate
slips of uniform size ; write on one side of the paper only, so
that every page faces a blank, bind the whole in brown paper
covers with three paper fasteners, stick a label on the outside
bearing names of play and character, leave a blank page at
the front for such items as costume, wig, make-up, changes,
properties, etc., peculiar to or used by the particular character.
This is the copy you will use at rehearsal and keep by you for
future use and reference. You will say this is taking a great
deal of trouble. Precisely, and the amount of pleasure you
derive from taking it will be a fair index to the measure of
your earnestness as a craftsman. Let me show you how this
Called Back was being played in London ; the
actor who was impersonating Macari fell ill. On a Monday
morning I was wired for. Slipping the part-I had played
Macari in the country six months before-into my pocket, I
was down at the theatre within an hour, met some of the
principals who had been summoned, rehearsed from one till
five, and at eight o'clock went on and played the part without
serious inconvenience to my fellow craftsmen. This result
was mainly due to my having followed the practice which I
am advising you to adopt, and led to a very comfortable
engagement. I have in my possession some hundred and
sixty parts I have “ gone on for" at one time and another,
ranging from Hamlet, Iago, Charles and Joseph Surface,
Richard Varney, Peranza, et hoc, to walking gentlemen,
habit pays.

Nothing marks the incompetent actor more thoroughly
than hesitation in rehearsing “business." The remark, “Oh,
there's some business' here,” annoys a stage-manager, and
I have often heard the rejoinder—“ Is there? Well, let us see
it. I should like to know what you are going to do.” Our best
artists are never tired of rehearsing “bits of business," and
only the novice, or the hopeless amateur will content himself
with the inane remark : “Oh, it will be all right at night.”
Learn your chief situations, exits, entrances, crosses, etc.,
first; detail work and specific “ business” should be studied
later, together with special positions, falls, positions in
“ pictures,” and so forth. All these must be carefully re-
hearsed, it is not enough to have a vague general idea of
them, or even to map them out in your mind.
Rehearse
them, thoroughly, over and over again. Leave no smallest
detail of “business" to chance, or that which is grandilo-
quently described as “inspiration." Write them down in
your part, and learn them by rote just as you do the lines, so
that they form a portion of the actual words committed to
memory. If you would learn the absolute necessity of
rehearsing every detail of stage “ business" go
and see such
a play as L'Enfant Prodigue half a dozen times, then try to
give a friend who has never seen it a clear idea of what it was
about without speaking a word ; or watch such masters of
pure pantomime as Leno and Roberts in some of their
choicest bits of cameo-work, and then attempt to do likewise.

“What place is this? Margaret! That boy !”
The line brought down the curtain, the rest was “busi-

worthy of the electrical effect it produced.

are representing. “ Business" relative to the person with
whom you are acting at any given moment, and which has a
direct and important bearing upon the part he or she is
playing. This must be noted and studied no less carefully
than the other. Make yourself perfectly acquainted with the
story. Without a minute and familiar knowledge of the play
as a whole your own lines will be as bewildering and unin-
telligible as the detached fragments of a Chinese puzzle.
Understand the scope, progress, and development of the plot,
the whole purpose of the author, and the bearing of each
individual character in every scene upon the story told in the
play. Only so will you get a rational idea of the proportion
and possibilities of your part, and its own proper “business."
You will often be tempted, by the force of example, a
vagrant imagination, the excitement of the moment, and other
things, to try your hand at extempore “business ;” but
unless you are the manager of your own company, or a
privileged and clever low-comedian, I strongly advise you to
I
resist the temptation--in the case of the exceptions I have
named, advise of any sort is usually waste of time. Any
o business that cannot be rehearsed is not worth your
attention; and unrehearsed “business is always discon-
certing to your fellow actors, seldom better than that origin-
ally devised, and sometimes a downright failure; besides
which, it is not safe to try experiments in public. There is
little need to urge this matter upon the veteran or the artist,
it is only the novice or the charlatan who would dare to divert
his genius or nervous energy, when endeavouring to hold an
audience, from the exposition of what he had studied, learned,
and rehearsed. As comedians are supposed to be the worst
offenders in introducing extempore“ business," it may be well
for you to know that it is not always so, and that those of you
who aspire to be comedians have precedents against, as well
as for the theory. I rehearsed the late George Barrett and
Samuel Johnson many times, and can safely say I never met

men who were more scrupulously careful to rehearse “busi-
" to the minutest detail, or more punctilious in adhering
to the author's text.
Do not form the habit of standing about in the wings
during the progress of the play, unless you have business
there. It is apt to block up entrances, or interfere with exits.
Never talk in the wings, even in a whisper. It is “bad
form," to put it mildly, and such practices are best left to
“extra” people, who can be dealt with in suitable, if
forcible language by the “super-master."
Standing still on the stage needs careful watching. Never
stand directly behind another person, unless such a position
is specially indicated as part of your “business.” If a cross
is made that places you behind another actor, shift your
position slightly to the right or left so as to “dress "the stage.
Do not stand so that two or more persons are in a straight
line parallel with the footlights; it is apt to give the effect of
a row of Christy Minstrels who have forgotten to put on their
cork; and, above all, do not misconstrue standing still into an
occasion specially devised to afford you an opportunity for
gazing into the auditorium or wings as if you were interested
in what was going on there. This advice may seem super-
fluous, but, unfortunately, experience proves that it is
necessary.
Entrances and exits are an important item in the “busi-
of most parts.
Not only must the position and
relevancy of each be clearly understood, but their manner and
significance are matters calling for the most careful study.
As a rule it is better for a character to pause if possible,
however slightly, on making a first entrance. Never advance
farther on to the stage without speaking than is absolutely
required, and if it is necessary for you to take the centre, do
so as it were by easy stages. Except in melodrama it is
irritating to see a man or woman sweep or stalk into the
centre of a scene and stick there, regardless of whether the

action or interest of the story is helped by their taking such a
position. Some of the most modest entrances I have ever
seen have been the most artistic, the most effective. Forbes
Robertson, Edward Terry, W. H. Vernon, Herman Vezin,
Fred Thorne, Beerbohm Tree, and John Hare are some of the
men whose unassuming entrances linger in my memory as
examples of restraint and subtlety. Never go bowling on to
the stage as if you had been fired from a gun and knew
exactly the point at which the momentum that carried you
there would cease. On the other hand beware of “happen-
ing" casually upon the scene as if you really had neither
part nor lot in its progress. Study the evolution of the play
and remember that the manner of your entrance at any given
moment will create an impression before you open your lips.
But a bad entrance is not so dire in its consequences as is
a feeble exit. In the former case you have the opportunity
all the while you are on the stage of removing to some extent
the false impression created, and of getting into line with the
general feeling of the situation; in the latter case this is not
You cease with your exit; you have gone, finished for
the time being, and have no chance of retrieving a bad exit.
Always lead up to an exit; give some intimation of your
intention, a look, a movement, an attitude will do it, and
except in particular and extremely rare cases your departure
must not appear unpremeditated or abrupt. This is to create
a feeling of uncertainty, improbability, or crudeness. Never
finish your line so as to leave yourself a long walk before you
make your exit, unless, of course, it is part of your express
“ business.” As a rule, especially in melodrama, finish
speaking as nearly as possible to your vanishing point, leaving
yourself one step, or at most two to be taken in silence. Let
your exit be in perfect unison with the tone, or spirit of the

been taking part, and the future movement of the story you
are helping to unfold. It is difficult to formulate rules, but
these hints are thrown out for the purpose of calling your
attention to the necessity for studying this part of your
“ business."
Speaking of “Entrances and Exits," Chas. Wm. Smith
says,
in The Actors' Art :-" These are of the greatest im-
importance. A novice, who, from nervousness, want of prac-
tice, or absolute carelessness, makes a bad entrance on the
stage, will find it very up-hill work during the scene, to over-
come the ill impression which he made at first; while a very
indifferent actor, who has acquired the art of making an
effective entrance, prepossesses the audience in his favour,
and, at least, is listened to with attention. A good exit is of
still more importance. It will frequently cover many defects,
and obtain applause after a badly acted scene; while, on the
contrary, a bad exit will frequently obliterate the effect of
good acting, and bring a fine scene to a 'most lame and
impotent conclusion.'
“In entering, and taking up a position on the stage, the
first consideration should be to get into a natural and effec-
tive attitude, free from all constraint, stiffness, and mannerism.
A novice almost invariably takes up his position with the leg
nearest the audience covering the one farthest from the
audience. He will also generally get into the same attitude
in kneeling or advancing to another person. The leg nearest
to the audience should never be advanced in front of the
other ; nor should an actor stand sideways to the audience,
with his legs close to each other, like a soldier standing in
line. The leg farthest from the audience should always be in
advance of the other, more or less, according to circumstances.
This is a most important point for a novice to attend to.
Practise entering and taking up a position in your own room
frequently. Although a lady's dress conceals her legs it is

equally essential for her to attend to this rule, in order to
preserve a natural and graceful' attitude.
“In making a rush on to the stage, commence the move-
ment several feet from the point where you
will come in sight,
and take particular care that your steps are firm and decided,
unless you have to represent indecision, fear, or any similar
feeling. See that there is nothing to impede you, such as an
awkwardly slung sword, or badly arranged drapery. Practise
entries of this kind again and again, until you can fix your
attitude, easily and effectively, exactly at the desired spot.
“In many cases, the second entrance is preferable to the
first. Actual trial of both in various cases, will show the
student the advantages of each entrance, better than written
instructions alone. Entrances from the back of the stage
have become very common, and are, doubtless, the most
effective and natural in many cases, giving the actor great
advantages, but they should not be so much used as they are
in many plays; for the actor is often obliged to make his exit
by the same way that he entered, and an exit from the back
of the stage is, generally speaking, nothing like so effective as
when made from the first entrance, if expression of face, or
power, or delicate modulation of voice, be important to the
passage. The entry from the back often displays the figure
to the greatest advantage, but, in making an exit there, the
face is not so well seen, and much of the volume of the voice
is lost before it reaches the audience, while very delicate
modulations which would be most effective if uttered close to
the proscenium, are not heard when given at the back of the
stage.
“In making an exit through the first or second entrances,
take care to retire, apparently without studied object, a step
or two up the stage, when within three or four paces of the
wing, and a few lines before the last, so as to make your exit
diagonally with the wing, by which your face and figure are
almost full front to the audience as you make

The “ business” of death scenes, especially if protracted,
love-making, fighting, struggling, etc., the bye-play in which
you are called upon to indulge during a scene, the main action
of which is in the hands of others, eating and drinking, and
so forth, should be thought out to the last detail, and con-
scientiously rehearsed at home and on the stage. Irving,
Coquelin, Leno, Harry Nicholls, Bernhardt, Duse, Mrs.
Patrick Campbell, and Mrs. Kendall all teach, by their
example at least, that in “ business” nothing should be left
to chance, nothing entrusted to inspiration.

Some quaint directions will be found in the various Guides
to the stage, still on sale, upon the subject of an actors'
wardrobe. Here is a sample :
6. The great number of actors who have to provide their own dresses,
has taught managers, especially country ones, a good lesson, few of
them now doing more than providing two or three old coats and tunics.
All other properties are left to be found by the performers themselves;
and to have a good stock of tights, boots, hats, swords, and other
etceteras, often procures a young man an engagement when he could
not get one for any of his other merits. The following is something
like an enumeration of the dresses required for the different lines of
business :-
TRAGEDY.—The First Tragedian will require dresses for Hamlet,
Richard, Macbeth, Richelieu, Claude Melnotte, etc., a toga for Roman
characters, two or three embroidered and plain shirts, a shape-dress for
Sir Giles Overreach, etc. A few different wigs, ringlets, etc., at least
three swords, a cross-sword, a Roman sword, and claymore, pantaloons,
and tights of various colours, in worsted and silk, russet boots, black
and russet shoes, sandals, old-English shoes with buckles, gauntlets,
plain and embroidered collars, ruffles, drawing-shirts, sword carriages,
belts, etc.; black, white, red, and various feathers; ornaments, such as
brooches, buckles, shoe and knee, a star, hat ornaments, the royal garter,
foreign orders, jewelled collar, coronets, etc., etc.
The SECOND, OR JUVENILE TRAGEDIAN, will also require most of
above, with the addition of modern suits, also various pairs of breeches,
pantaloons, etc.
LIGHT COMEDY.—A well cut modern wardrobe; military and naval
dress and undress uniforms; a dress coat with steel buttons; dress
sword, regulation sword, epaulettes; tights, russet boots and shoes.
Most comedians wear their own hair, which, of course, they will have

a
to take some pains in having dressed, but a few wigs are also required
for such parts as Rochester, also a good white wig for the powder-
pieces, etc.
Old Men.—Characteristic wigs, ruffles, cravats, and hats; walking-
sticks, buckles, watch-chain and seals; square-toed shoes, stockings,
etc. No characters are more effectively rendered by dress than old men.
It very fortunately happens that most theatres are pretty well stocked
with old English dresses, therefore performers need scarcely trouble
themselves about complete ones—a few requisites will enable them with
what is in the stock, to make a tolerable appearance in this style of
costume.
Low Comedy.—The Low Comedian should provide himself with
wigs of various characters, stockings of peculiar patterns, coats and
trousers of quaint cuts, waistcoats of various styles in modern farce, so
much being left to the dressing. He will, likewise, require countrymen's
coats and breeches of various materials and colours; shape dresses for
Fathom, Lopez, etc.; servants' gold band, cockade, and liveries; feathers,
etc. We think a Low Comedian cannot have too many wigs, some who
have been eminent in the profession have had a complete gallery.
WALKING GENTLEMEN require all the useful articles enumerated
under each of the above heads, excepting, of course, those peculiarly
pertaining to the leading characters.
For the LADIES their own knowledge will direct them; but they
must bear in mind that our provincial theatres provide no dresses at all
for them everything they wear must therefore be provided at their
own cost.
The following epitome will serve as a guide :-
TRAGEDY.—Black velvet dress, with long and short sleeves, white
satin dresses with long and short sleeves, scarlet robe, jewelled
stomacher, coronet, dagger, cestus, head dresses, veils, point lace
drapery, silver spangled trimming, beads of various kinds, sandals,
shoes of black velvet, white and black satin shoes, and various other
oddments which can only be ascertained by personal description.
Comedy.-White satin and other dresses, hats, fans, veils, scarfs
flowers, etc., etc. Silk fleshings, frock coat, trousers, waistcoat, boots
and hat for disguise parts, page's dress, Turkish dress, peasant's
dresses, of all nations, gloves, mittens, aprons, cottage bonnets, and
various other little things of names known only to the sex.
MELODRAMA.—Scarlet stuff dress, with pocket made in dress, black
velvet body made with stomacher, gipsy hat, French head-dress, shoes
of various kinds.
BURLESQUES AND GENERAL BUSINESS.-Silk fleshings, Wellington
boots, tunic, white silk tights, russet boots, Turkish trousers, peasants'
dresses of all nations, a sailor's dress, and a great variety of others.

ܪܐ
)
OLD WOMEN.-High heeled shoes, old-fashioned fans, hooped petti-
coat, old-fashioned bed-gown and nightcap, mittens, long, short, and
plain, pattens, etc., etc.
The material of which ladies dresses are made, is not an object, so
much as the style and arrangement of colour, but it is superfluous to
offer advice on the subject, when so much good taste is generally found.”
Then follows an advertisement of somebody's picture book
of dramatic costumes, “one volume of males and one of
females, for 22s. each ; coloured at £5 per volume."
There is an air of mossy mediævalism about these direc-
tions that is not altogether without charm ; but I much fear it
can no longer be said that “to have a good stock of tights,
boots, hats, swords and other etceteras, often procures a
young man an engagement when he could not get one for
any of his other merits.” This short cut to an engagement
belonged to the “good old times,” and is closed now; in
these degenerate days there is a tendency to engage men and
women for some of their “ other merits," although contem-
porary advertisements of the “portable” class still specify
that artists are required to “dress well, on and off.”
As a rule an actor or actress is required to find modern
costume only at the present time. In costume pieces the
management provides the wardrobe, leaving you to find shoes
(sometimes), stockings, wig, and special jewellery. See that
your modern wardrobe is the best you can afford, and always
keep it in perfect condition. This is economy. Clothes well
brushed, pressed, and sound as to buttons, linings, etc. Linen
immaculate, silk hats well blocked and ironed, ties fresh and
of the latest fashion, boots sound and well tree'd, gloves and
handkerchiefs--as such things should be. It is generally best
to buy good second-hand clothes for stage wear, never go on
in perfectly new clothes if you can help it, there is a lack of
character about them that is disappointing. Keep a sharp
look out for creaking boots, never wear obsolete or extreme
collars, badly fitting shirts, gloves that do not harmonise or
contrast, or startling and bisarre neckties. These instruc-

a
tions refer to characters that are supposed to be dressed as
modern gentlemen. Character actors will do well to hunt
for what they want as they want it, though occasionally a
particular article full of character may be picked up cheap and
added to the wardrobe, but as a rule promiscuous buying is a
mistake. Certainly, at the outset of your career it is a foolish
waste of money to buy a miscellaneous assortment of things
that you will probably never want. This rule holds equally
for ladies. Those who play in melodrama will doubtless
provide themselves with the indispensable, long, black,
hooded cloak in which outraged and hunted virtue always
clothes itself, or the extensive toilette of satin and frou-frou
that marks heartlessness and vice, according to the line of
business they intend to follow ; but for purposes of modern
drama they will find it best to buy specific things for specific
parts. One word as to the cut of the skirt ; if your
dress-
maker is not accustomed to cut frocks for the stage, be sure
the skirt is cut a little longer in front than is ideal for street
wear.
Just a hint as to special costumes, uniforms, dresses
peculiar to a given period or calling. When the management
puts the dressing of a piece into the hands of a costumier, the
stage-manager generally says: “You can go down to
So-and-So's and have a look at your things.” Be careful to
do so. If you are playing a minor part, and the costumier is
a “superior person” in his trade, you will probably be told
that your costume is not ready. Do not retire, crushed and
feeling that you ought to apologise to the sartorial artist;
but ask at what hour on the following day you shall call to
“try it on.”
Here is the substance of a conversation I over-
heard in the establishment of a peculiarly magnificent
costumier not long since.
“Good morning. I have called to see my things for the
Count de Liniéres.”
“Oh, ah. You're from the Cloches, ain't you?"

“I dough no. ’Eer, Ben, d'jew know anything about

“Yes they 'ave, they come back this morning."

After some ten minutes spent in gazing aimlessly about

The lady blew up a speaking tube and summoned the
proprietor, who in turn summoned Ben. An altercation in an
undertone followed between these two, at the end of which
Ben sulkily retired; presently returning with a costume that
had been sent to me some six months before for Joseph
Surface, and which would have been about as good a fit for the
anxious Count as the Lyceum Dubosc's raiment with Weedon
Grossmith for a lining. Whereupon I left the shop, reflect-
ing that on the whole it was wise to go “and have a look at
your things" before venturing into them, when the dressing
of a piece was left in the hands of a costumier.
In modern costume for men the most scrupulous attention
to detail is necessary, in London at least, and the art of
dressing is one that should receive careful study at the hands.
of every young actor. Watch what such men as John Hare,
Charles Wyndham, Allan Aynesworth, and Arthur Bouchier
wear when playing modern parts—and how they wear it.
The entire absence of picturesqueness in modern clothing
worn by men renders it necessary to exert the utmost
care in its selection and cut.

copy of
Let your
In the matter of studying parts everyone is supposed to
be a law unto himself, or herself, and directions as to methods
have usually been regarded by writers on dramatic art as
superfluous. But, in my teaching experience I have been
asked by nine-tenths of my pupils : “What is the best way to
study a part ?” and the question must be my excuse for
making a few suggestions.
Some actors, and many actresses study from a full
the text of the play, when they can get one. Fortunately
this does not happen often, and it is always comforting to
reflect that lazy people take the most trouble,
invariable rule be never to study the words of a part from a
full copy of the text. Read the play in its entirety, when you
have the opportunity of doing so, before paying especial
attention to your own part; then make a fair copy* of the
cues you have to take and the words you have to speak, care-
fully bracketting all items of “business” affecting you
indicated in the text—whether they occur in your lines or not.
Learn your words from this copy, it will save confusion, and
the mere fact of having disentangled your cues and written
out every word you have to speak will help to fix the part in
your mind, crystallising it, and giving it definiteness of out-
line. It will also save you the mortification of discovering
that you have incidentally learned more of other people's
parts than your own. Underline the cues you take with red
ink, and the cues you give with black. Learn these first,
parrot-fashion, if need be, but insist upon learning them.
This will give you a general knowledge of your bearings and
make the task of acquiring the rest of your words very much
easier. Commit all “ business” to memory as it occurs, and
you will find your grip of your part much greater at rehearsal
than it would be if you had been content with getting a
merely general knowledge of your “business." Never fall
into the slovenly habit of “fluffing" over your words at the

first few rehearsals ; learn them ; you can at least emulate an
average school-boy of fourteen by committing to memory a a
few lines. Two or three hours of concentrated attention will
suffice to break the back of any part of ordinary length, so far
as the words are concerned. It is a childish mistake to
suppose you can learn lines that are ill-written better than
from a clean and sightly manuscript; I have read in one of
the Guides that you“ study more perfectly from an illegible
copy than a good manuscript, because the pains taken to
ascertain the sentences impress them indelibly on the
memory.” You will take such a statement for what it is
worth, my own experience is that a perfectly clean and
legible manuscript helps me to study easily and rapidly.
Be scrupulously careful about the cues you give ; remem-
ber that the next speaker depends entirely on you, and
that while it is bad to miss a cue given to you, it is
unpardonable to fail in giving a cue to another. Master
these without delay, so that you are easy with them at your
second rehearsal, if not sooner. Commit to memory any
letter you have to read on the stage.
The “assistant stage-
manager," to give the gentleman his euphemistic title, is
often too busy, and sometimes too lazy, to write them clearly
or correctly; the lights on the stage are not always
conveniently adjusted for reading, nor is it easy under
the average conditions that obtain during a scene to read
naturally. As to the best time for study, that is a point
which must be decided by experience. My own mental
activity is greatest in the night; but the best-quickest and
firmest—"study” I ever met was a lady pupil, who com-
mitted her parts to memory between the hours of eight and
eleven in the morning. Learn your words aloud, in a sub-
dued voice, so as to accustom your ear to the sound of the
words you speak, otherwise you will have difficulty in recog-
nising them at rehearsal.

If you
of your best consideration. Imagine the scene.
don't see it you can't paint it : c'est notre métier de figurer les
choses.” Solly says, “This idea of the importance of clearly
picturing to oneself the scene, strongly advocated by Coquelin
as the foundation of success in either reciting or acting, and
insisted on by Legouvé as even essential in reading aloud,
has two functions. It not only aids the performer to grasp
the situation fully and to put a living picture before
the eyes of his audience, but it is also the sound method
of committing to memory." Legouvé writes : “Do not
occupy yourself at first with the words ; take account of the
composition of the piece and of the movement of the ideas :
notice whence the author sets out, which way
he
passes,
whither he arrives. Impress on your mind, if I may thus
express myself, the architecture of the page in such a manner
that its general lines are drawn in your memory and become
fixed there as a kind of framework, before you proceed to
learn the words." Got has been heard to say to a pupil, who
was complaining that he had not had time to master a part,
that he could not expect to learn it if he did not picture
to himself the movement of the scene. He urges, too, ac-
cording to Solly, the importance of reproducing the exact
individual imagined by the dramatist, and one often hears,
" You don't enter into the skin of this character.
not the personage; you have not his bearing. He is, for
instance, a dry, acute old lawyer ; not loud and noisy, as you
make him. Try to see him ; if you don't you can't put the
proper tones into your voice." In support of this view
Coquelin writes of his own method of studying a part :
" When I have to create a part, I begin by reading the play
with the greatest attention five or six times. First, I consider
what position my character should occupy ; on what plane in
the picture I must put him. Then I study his psychology.
Knowing what he thinks, what he is morally, I deduce what
he ought to be physically, what will be his carriage, his

>)
manner of speaking, his gesture. These characteristics once
decided, I learn the part without thinking about it further.
Then, when I know it, I take up my man again, and, closing
my eyes, I say to him, “Recite this for me.' Then I see him
delivering the speech, the sentence I asked him for-he
lives, he speaks, he gesticulates before me, and then I have
only to imitate him.”
Your duties at rehearsal will quickly teach you the neces-
sity for cultivating certain business habits, such as punctu-
ality, alertness, concentration of attention, and so on. Let
nothing interfere with your work, the principal of which is
done at rehearsal. No social considerations, no pleasure or
amusements, nothing must be allowed to distract your atten-
tion from your paramount duty of rehearsal. Nothing dis-
'
tinguishes the actor from the dilletanté more completely than
the light in which he regards these most important oppor-
tunities. To paraphrase an old saw : study is silvern and
rehearsal is golden. Other things being equal the best actor
is the man who is most conscientious at rehearsal. Here
you will find a liberal education in the art you are following ;
this is your happy hunting-ground for ideas, hints, examples,
and information. What the gymnasium is to the professional
athlete ; what the drill-ground is to the soldier; what the
practice-room is to the musician,-rehearsals are to the actor.
It is impossible to exaggerate their value; and at the outset
of your professional life, you will do well to make a compact
with yourself to allow nothing to come between you and your
rehearsals. See that you are in condition to make the utmost
use of them. Never go down to rehearsal at your “second-
best,” hurried, “ stale,” unprepared, tired. Some men, and
many women use rehearsals as opportunities for studying
their words. This is a grave error ; rehearsals are occasions
for practising what you have studied-after the first, that is-
your words should be mastered without delay, elsewhere than
in the theatre. There you will want to bend all your energies

and put forth the best powers of your intelligence to grasp
the play as a whole, to learn the scope of the story, under-
stand the drift and meaning of the author in the drawing of
your part and its bearing on the general scheme of the piece.
I have heard old actors say they cannot study the
words of a part except at rehearsal, and have seen them
floundering about the stage with a copy of their part in their
hand within two days of the production of a new piece ; with
the result that at the first performance-by which they knew
they would be judged, and the play lauded or condemned-
they have been in an agony of terror lest the prompter should
let
go of them for a single moment. How can men, labour-
ing under such conditions, expect to do justice to their own
powers, much less to to the work of the author ? Go to
rehearsal with the fullest determination to get all the material
you can that is helpful, informative, suggestive in relation to
the play and your part; take it home with you, study it,
assimilate it, make it your own, then go to rehearsal and
practise what you have learnt. If you could once realise the
weary, heart-sick paralysis that steals over the clear-headed,
hardworking stage-manager, as he sees grown up men and
women, who are going to draw salaries presently, coming
down day after day to rehearsal in the same condition of
imperfectness in their words, insisting upon the same “ dear
old" blunders that they made on the first available occasion,
requiring to be told and re-told the same things in their
“ business" until he feels as if he should "jump up and die
dancing,” or wishes he had learned a little profane language
when he was young, the realisation would make you ashamed
for the rest of your life to put less than your absolute best
into every rehearsal it was your privilege to attend.
Make a rule of being on the stage five minutes before the
time for which you are called. Never mind who else is late,
that is none of your business, see that you are in time ; do not
fall into the habit of supposing that because you are not on in the

first act, that therefore there is no need for you to be present
when the rehearsal commences. Frequently it is more con-
venient for the stage-manager to take the second, or some
other act first, and even if you do not appear until quite the
end of the play, be present, quietly waiting in a wing, where
you will be out of everyone's way, and watch, in an unosten-
tatious manner, all that is going forward. At the risk of
repeating myself let me urge upon you never to be guilty of
talking at rehearsal : keep your attention concentrated on
what is happening on the stage; the betting will keep, current
can be discussed elsewhere-or not discussed, your
doings and happenings are not so important as your business
- and that is on the stage. Rivet your eyes, ears, attention,
and interest on that, and let everything else take care of itself
for the time being. Do not be in evidence when you are not
on the stage; principals sometimes object—especially second-
rate principals-to others looking on during rehearsal. Your
own taste must be your guide in this matter, and it is usually
possible to observe, without appearing to watch, what is
going forward. Fortunately the days are past when the
direction given in a certain Guide to the stage, still published,
needs to be observed : Having rehearsed one scene, should
you have another, or anything farther to do in the piece,
retire to the green-room, until you are again called." The
green-room is very little used now, and you will not be over-
done with “ calls.” During rehearsal you will be expected
to be there when wanted.
Here is an epitome of some of the worst and most mis-
leading advice ever given in this connection, culled from the
pages of another Guide.
It has been said that the best method of strengthening the voice
and keeping it in order for night, both for actors and singers, is to speak
or sing as loudly at the rehearsal as you would at night. We consider
this to be a great error. The quickest and surest way to ruin the voice
is to fatigue it by too much wear. The actors who play the subordinate
characters might rehearse aloud without being fatigued in voice at

night; and advantageously, in so far as improving the voice by
practice; but such a method is certain to beget constraint and an
unnatural style of action and elocution. It is most difficult, and to most
actors very unpleasant, to 'get up the steam' in rehearsing even a
leading character full of the most poetic and impassioned language. To
compel an actor to act á minor part at rehearsal as he ought to do at
night, a la Macready and his copyists, for the edification of his fellow
actors, and a few scene-shifters, is converting the stage into a school for
unnatural, conventional acting and elocution, and making a rehearsal
a mental torture to the sensitive. It may not be so to the mere stick,'
who has no more feeling than one of Punch's puppets; but to the feeling
it is so, and none but the sensitive are properly fitted to be actors.
Strange that the profession of the stage should be made most unpleasant
to those most fitted for it! Most of our greatest actors never acted at
rehearsal, except when trying the effect of a particular passage or point.
Imagine Edmund Kean being compelled to act at his one rehearsal at
Drury Lane, before the doubting, the carping, the envious, the jealous,
who are always to be found ready to rejoice at the failure of the new
aspirant for fame, whether on the platform, at the bar, in the senate, or
on the stage."
I think any modern actor of distinction will tell you that
there is infinitely greater danger of your under-rehearsing
than over-rehearsing. The careless, slipshod, muttering, and
scrambling through a part at rehearsal ; the sorry exhibition
of imperfect words, atrocious elocution, uneven acting, and
uncertain business that is sometimes allowed to pass, should
be held responsible for many a "frost." "All right at night,
my boy.”
The man who can say it as an excuse for slovenly
rehearsal, ought to be choked. It is a cant phrase that has
proved its fallacy from time immemorial. I remember hearing
a man who, on the strength of a bubble-reputation, made use
of the expression on the stage of the St. James's, during a
certain classic management, well caught up by a stage-
manager who had been accustomed to handle actors.
"'All right at night,' what do you mean? You're not
in the provinces! Let us have a little of your all-rightness
You seem to forget where you are !”
As for the nonsense talked by the “authority” I have
just quoted about the "quickest and surest way to ruin the
voice” being “to fatigue it by too much wear,'' there is not a

leading actor of modern plays who would not cheerfully run
the risk of rehearsing his voice to rags if he could only get
hold of a part that gave him the opportunity of taking it. A
well-trained voice can hardly be overworked under modern
conditions of acting; and when you consider the amount of
vocal exertion taken by artists like Santley, Lloyd, Albani,
Patti, Leno, and Roberts, or speakers and reciters like the
late W. E. Gladstone and Samuel Brandram, the average
actor or actress need have no anxiety about ruining the voice
" by too much wear. Do not listen to such counsel; but
put
all you can into your work at rehearsal. A safer rule is
to endeavour to put a little more into your rehearsals than
you will want to do at night; certainly do not imagine that
mumbling or gabbling over the lines allotted to you, and
walking through the part like a partially animated stick is of
the slightest service, the stage-manager is not yearning to
waste his time over such a sorry display.
A word as to the stage-manager. Understand clearly that
at rehearsal he is the sole and ultimate court of appeal. He
is there to issue orders, and to be implicitly obeyed. His
business is to guide and govern the whole machinery of which
you are simply a more or less important fraction. Never
dream of arguing with a stage-manager. He knows what
results he is working to produce, and why he wants any
particular thing done in a certain way is a matter that does
not concern you ; you may not know, probably it is not
important you should, anyhow, your business is to carry out
his instructions, in the spirit as well as the letter, to the very
best of your ability. A good stage-manager will never
interfere with you if he can help it, or for the mere pleasure of
doing so, and in the case of a bad stage-manager you always
have your remedy-it is supposed to be a free country and
there is nothing to prevent your throwing up your part, only
do not argue. Stage-management under the most favourable
circumstances is about the most difficult, delicate, trying, and

thankless work it is possible for a man to earn his living at in
this world ; do not have it on your conscience that you
have
added to its unpleasantness by offering less than the very best
of yourself at rehearsal.
Do not be nervous of your first professional rehearsals.
Behave as a gentleman, carry yourself without "swagger"
or “side,” and you will meet with little but kindness and
consideration. I shall never forget my own first experience
of the kind. I had gone down to the theatre in an agony of
clammy terror; my knees knocked together, my tongue clave
to the roof of my mouth, that seemed to be lined an inch
thick with blotting paper, and I was feeling unutterably
miserable. Two men saw my condition and came to my
rescue. They told me kindly and quietly what to do, and how
best to do it. It is a long time ago, and they have probably
never thought of it, but, if they will pardon my mentioning
their names, Julian Cross and George Giddens saved a poor
wretch untold misery that morning, and earned his undying
gratitude.
And this is not an isolated instance ; I have seen
the same thing over and over again, it is the rule rather than
the exception.

SECTION V.
Professional Life.
In going on the stage you are not more certainly entering
a profession than joining a family circle. Acting is an art
which, in England, is unrepresented at a single University ;
it does not boast a College or School that can be regarded as
representative; it has no curriculum of study, no examining
board, no teaching staff, nothing that can confer academic
distinction of any kind. You are entering a "profession'
that can only be so styled by courtesy, and whatever may be
in store for those who come after you, will have no Alma
Mater to point to as a guarantee that you have been
nourished at all. How fully this is recognised and how
deeply deplored by the more scholarly and artistic actors of
the present time may be gathered from their utterances ;
from Henry Neville—who for years was simply " the voice of
one crying in the wilderness”—to H. B. Irving, T. B.
Thalberg, and almost every rising actor with any claim to
distinction.
But whatever its status as a profession there is no doubt
that the stage is a great family circle ; one too in which the
members seldom grow old enough, or staid enough to be
altogether seriously regarded as “grown ups." You will
find very few “stodgy," stereotyped men and women on the
stage ; their virtues and their sins are usually the sins and
virtues of children ; they are not distinguished for the usual

adult virtues, such as avarice, hardness of heart, consuming
selfishness, wariness, and conventional respectability.
If the main object of religion so far as it relates to this
life is the cultivation of dispositions, the bringing of the daily
life of men and women under the domination of faith, hope,
and charity-and especially the last—then it would seem that
the actor's calling must be classed among the most potent of
active religious agencies; certainly no other profession
known among civilized peoples tends to bring its followers
more directly under the sway and influence of these sublime
forces. The struggling actor or actress walks by faith, lives
on hope, and understands the very genius of charity better
than all the professed philanthropies in the world put
together. Here are the words of Mr. George R. Sims, who
will scarcely be charged with not knowing whereof he
speaks, and who, although one of the stage's best friends, is
not himself an actor. “ During his lifetime the actor is ever
the first in the cause of charity. There is no profession so
generous or so sympathetic. The ladies and gentlemen of
the stage give their services freely for any good causes that
may be submitted to them. They help each other, and they
help the great public charities in which they have no share.
Their quiet unostentatious generosity is a great tax upon their
leisure, and frequently a great drain upon their resources, but
I have never known an actor or actress refuse to help when
the cause was a good one.” The hardest thing to destroy is
an actor's faith, or hope—his charity, either of purse or heart
you cannot kill. I know whereof I speak, and am prepared
out of my own very average experience to give the lie to
salaried traducers, polished cynics, and half-informed fanatics.
“The impurity of the stage !” It is a cant cry, only raised
for the purpose of confusing the issue by interested persons
who have not the honesty to discriminate between negative
virtues and positive vices. There is no morality of the stage;
equally, there is no immorality of the stage.

conditions of character that can only be postulated of
persons, and immoral persons are to be found-even on the
stage. “But the tendency of acting is to loosen the moral
fibre of those who follow it." Pardon me, ladies and gentle-
men, but this is sheer drivel. The average life of the stage
affords the men and women who follow it barely time or
opportunity to be moral, and none at all to follow immorality
as a fine art; that is the luxury of the leisured and the
wealthy. When you consider the dregs and leavings of
civilization's choicest lepers that are constantly being shot
upon the stage, it is as wonderful that the great majority of
its followers are found leading the sweet, simple, large-
hearted lives they do, as that New South Wales ever
developed into a pattern of law-abiding, industrious respect-
ability.
Men and women come to me constantly with the question :
“Is the stage a calling that I can safely follow ? My friends
all advise me not to adopt it as a profession because it is so
full of temptations, uncertainty, and wickedness. What do
you think?" To such enquirers I can only say it depends on
the man or woman. If a man is a fool, or if a woman is
disposed to be of light behaviour, they had better seek some
other means of earning a livelihood; there are plenty of such
people to be found on the stage, unfortunately, but it has not
a monopoly, and neither folly nor wantonness are prime
qualifications for this particular profession. I hold no brief
for the stage. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
mind. I have seen parsons at boxing competitions and actors
in church; but have not therefore concluded that the Church
is brutal in its instincts or the stage intrinsically religious.
One precious Guide to the stage opens with the words :
“ Advice to persons about to go upon the Stage- Don't!"
I fancy Punch gave somewhat similar advice upon another
subject, in which connection it was equally valuable-and
followed. The writer then goes

Matthews, whom he reports as having said that he would
not allow a dog of his to go upon the stage, if he could
help it—which is easily understood—and proceeds to moral-
ise thus : "And if he (Charles Matthews), with all the
advantages he derived from the stage, said so, we do not
wonder that other actors and actresses who have been less
successful should speak of the profession with still more
bitterness. We should certainly say to all to whom it may
concern, turn a blacksmith or a bricklayer's labourer, rather
than an actor of any kind. We know that there are hundreds
connected, in one way or other, with the stage, who never
enjoy one moment's happiness in consequence. Knowing
this, it will not, therefore, be expected that we are at all
advocates for devotees to the Thespian art. No! and if we
can persuade anyone from joining a profession which has been
the ruin of thousands, we will willingly do so ; but on the
other hand, if people insist upon making fools of themselves,
and will go upon the stage, it as well that they should be
directed how properly to proceed about it. For want of this
advice many have erred, been led into most unnecessary
expense, and endured much needless trouble and annoyance.”
All of which is most profoundly true-of every square peg
that tries to get itself fitted into a round hole. It is a curious
fact, but you will find men in every profession who talk in a
like strain. Barristers have been heard to declare that no
sons of theirs should ever spend their lives “brief-hunting ;'
successful medical practitioners do not always advise men to
become doctors, and even parsons have been known to bring
their sons up to insurance agency. On the other hand, the off-
spring of flourishing tripe-dressers have entered the Church
with the paternal sanction, and a butcher of my acquaintance
pays his son's fees at an art school. The generalisation
respecting the “hundreds connected with the stage who never
enjoy one moment's happiness in consequence,” may be justi-
fied by the author's experience ; but there are many in every

profession, who, lacking humour, patience, knowledge,
decision of character, industry and conscientiousness, are
ready enough to charge their lack of happiness upon their
profession, just as the unsuccessful actor may be found ready
to explain his miserable condition on various grounds, such
as overcrowded ranks, the invasion of the stage by monied
incapables, society's “ doubtful blessings,” or educated men
and women; the hopeless decadence of modern dramatic
taste that refuses the wholesome pabulum of a bygone
generation, that is too stale to be interesting and too new
to be classic; or “Luck,” which is the favourite ground
of all.
I have met many of the so-called “ failures” of the stage,
and their lot was certainly full of pain. Nor were they always
to be accounted for by cheap explanations or obvious causes.
Pathetic enough are some of their stories ; men and women
working, struggling, hoping against hope, outdistanced by
others of inferior calibre, unaccepted by the great mass of
the public, comparatively unheard of, uncomplaining, obscure
—but, not all unhappy, squalid, or unpicturesque, which is
more than can be said of some of the world's “dead-beats.”
It is difficult to call them“ failures,” out-and-out; for success
has sometimes been within the reach of their powers, and
often they have shed about them the fragrance of brave,
simple, kindly lives, in the face of discouragements that
would have soured inferior natures. To paraphrase Mr.
Andrew Lang *: they present to us the spectacle of a real
triumph far beyond the petty gains of money or of applause ;
the spectacle of lives made less unhappy by the art they
follow, unvexed by notoriety, unfretted by envy.
What we
call success could hardly yield them so much, for the ways
of
successful dramatic careers are dusty and stony, and the
stones are only too handy for throwing at the few that,

deservedly or undeservedly, make a name, and therewith
about one-tenth of the wealth which is ungrudged to phy-
sicians, or barristers, or stock-brokers, or dentists, or elec-
tricians. If acting and occupation with the drama were not
its own reward, truly they who seem to succeed might envy
those who fail. It is not wealth that they win, as fortunate
men in other professions count wealth ; it is not rank nor
fashion that come to their call, nor come to call on them,
although Society occasionally amuses itself by “taking
up" and patronising actors and actresses. Their success is
to be let dwell with their own fancies, or with the imagina-
tions of others far greater than themselves; their success is
this living in fantasy-a little remote from the hubbub and
the contests of the world. At the best they will be vexed by
curious eyes and idle tongues ; at the best they will die not
rich in this world's goods, yet not unconsoled by the friend-
ships which they win among men and women whose faces
they will never recognise. They may well be content, and
thrice content, with their lot, yet it is not a lot which should
provoke envy, nor be coveted by ambition.
And without paraphrase we may apply Mr. Lang's noble
concluding sentences : “It is not an easy goal to attain, as
the crowd of aspirants dream, nor is the reward luxurious
when attained. A garland, usually fading and not immortal,
has to be run for, not without dust and heat."
Nevertheless, as they of old found the garland-fading
and not immortal-worth running for, so may actors and
actresses count upon an exhilaration and satisfaction in the
mere running of the race that is set before them ; for “ one
success they can hardly miss, the happiness of living, not
with trash," but among congenial and sympathetic com-
panions, in an atmosphere charged with the electricity of
artistic sensibility, a-throb with the best efforts of the quick,
the mighty, and the supple among those who think and write.

practical course will be for me to deal with the questions
usually asked by those who desire to adopt the stage as a
profession; the first of which in my experience is :
“Where should I apply, in the first place, for reliable
information concerning the stage? I have been told various
tales, mostly by people not themselves connected with the
dramatic profession; but I want really reliable information.
Where can I get it ?"
A
very
few
years ago this would have been almost impos-
sible to answer, directly or satisfactorily. “Do you know
anyone on the stage ?” would generally have been the
response ; and if the answer had been in the negative, the
enquirer would have been recommended to try an agent, put
an advertisement in the Era, or write to one of the “ Drama-
tic Studios" advertised in the theatrical papers. In any case
the information obtained would have been inconclusive, un-
reliable, and more or less unsatisfactory. The dramatic
agents, with certain rare exceptions, were a set of illiterate
sharks, who contented themselves with working for artists
who would have been better without their services ; the
recognised theatrical organs were too busy playing the game
of “pull devil, pull tailor" to find time for so unremunerative
a thing as the imparting of information, and the “ Dramatic
Studios” were frequently under the direction of men who,
whatever their artistic and educational qualifications, had
never learned to believe that it is more blessed to give than
to receive.
Happily, this state of things is much modified and promises
soon to be effectually reformed. After years of inconclusive
discussion and incoherent complaint, a spirit of cohesion and
solidarity was developed among the members of the dramatic
profession, with the result that in 1891 The Actors' Associa-
tion was established, and with it an absolutely reliable source
of information and court of appeal in matters theatrical sprang
into existence. This excellent institution, to which every

actor and actress should belong the moment they are qualified
for membership, has done much to revolutionise the status of
the actor. Incorruptible, dignified, and sympathetic, it has
rolled away the reproach of casualness, shiftlessness, and
unbusinesslike habits from the stage as a profession. The
offices of the Association are situate at 36 St. Martin's Lane,
London, W.C. Its present officers are :

An officially published leaflet gives twenty nine cogent
reasons why every actor and actress should become a member
of The Actors' Association, to which one or two others might
be added, as, for example :
Because considering the accommodation provided and the
advantages offered, and that the entrance fee (5/-) and anuual
subscription (10/-) cover all calls, The Actors' Association
may be regarded as one of the cheapest and best Clubs in
London.
Because it is so ably administered financially that the
report of the Council for year ending December 31st,
1899, shows sufficient assets to pay the liabilities eight times
over.
Now as the genius of the Association is to organise and
assist all schemes that may tend to benefit the profession-
see: Memorandum, 3. The objects for which the Association
is established—it is reasonable to suppose that this first
question of almost every man and woman who seriously
purposes adopting the stage as a profession would be satis-
factorily answered at 36, St. Martin's Lane, on application to

the Secretary or duly appointed official. Such indeed it may
safely be assumed, would have been the case long ere this
had the catholic-minded section of the members, who believe
in statesmanship rather than “parish-pump" politics, led by
such men as John Hare, H. B. Irving, George Alexander,
Forbes Robertson, Hadyn Coffin, Wilson Barrett, T. B.
Thalberg and Acton Bond, been of greater numerical
strength. Unfortunately the other party, which appears to
include at least a talking majority, is too busy endeavouring,
in a burst of stultification, to make the Association a close-
communion coterie of the elect-carefully preserved and
jealously guarded by an “eighty-weeks-in-actual-salaried-
‘
employment" fence, as a condition of eligibility for member-
ship-to give its attention to such a question as where the
future members shall apply for reliable and official informa-
tion concerning the profession of their choice. At the same
time I can say from knowledge that the intending actor or
actress will receive the most courteous consideration at the
hands of, in an unofficial capacity, the Secretary or any one
of the members of the Council—which is splendidly repre-
sentative-to whom they address a serious and sensible
enquiry, and the time cannot be far distant when the retro-
grade section will recognise the monstrous injustice they are
doing to the very spirit of the objects for which the Associa-
tion was established.* The educated minority who object to
the noble institution of which they are justly proud being
degraded into the position of a mere Vigilance Committee, or
even “a kind of sublimated trades' union,'' already perceive
that, rightly understood, the Actors' Association is the
nucleus of a University, a force and potency that cannot
logically pause in its development until it has become the
legitimate entrance-gate to the dramatic profession.
Here are a few significant deliverances to which I would

draw your most careful attention. The first is an extract
from the Report of the Council of The Actors' Association for
Year ending December 31st, 1899.
“The question of Selection, Training, and Registration has been
prominently before the members of the Association during the year. A
meeting was held at the Lyceum in July last, and a committee was
appointed to prepare a scheme, which was submitted to the members at
a meeting held at Her Majesty's Theatre in December, when the scheme
was referred back to the committee for re-consideration, and the scheme
so re-considered will be placed before the members at the ninth Annual
General Meeting. In this connection it is well to remember that at the
meeting in December, Mr. Wilson Barrett very generously offered to
found a scholarship of £50 per annum, for three years, and to renew the
same at the end of that period, should he then be satisfied with the work-
ing of the scheme."
The second is from some notes in The Stage, for April 5th,
1900.
At the usual weekly meeting of the Council of The Actors'
Association, held on Tuesday, April 3rd, the Secretary
reported the result of the meeting at Her Majesty's Theatre,
on March 30th, and Messrs. H. B. Irving and Acton Bond
were deputed to carry out the instructions given at such
meeting :-
“ To approach the heads of the profession and others, with a view
to their forming themselves into a committee for the purpose of formu-
lating a scheme for the foundation of an academy of acting.”
“The foregoing resolution means that the heads of the profession,
and a few literary people . are to put into words a 'workable 'scheme
founded on the ideas put forward by the schemes already submitted, and
that as soon as they have done this the Selection, Training, and Regis-
tration of actors will be commenced in good earnest.”
The third is from the leading article of the same issue
dealing with a paper, by H. B. Irving, read before the
Playgoers' Club, on The Actors' Art and Status.
“There is another aspect to the status of the actor-that more
strictly professional. Before a lay audience Mr. Irving was sparing in
his references hereto. But it is, of course, a consideration of the
greatest importance. Public opinion may do—and is increasingly doing
-much to place the position of the actor higher. But only the actors
themselves can give it those conditions which belong to an organised

profession. Mr. Irving touched once or twice indirectly on the internal
working of the profession. He drew attention on the one hand to the
loafer and the man who fails in his own career, lamenting the temptation
that the stage offers to them. He welcomed, on the other hand, what
has been called the invasion of the stage by well-bred and well-educated
ladies and gentlemen. “If the ordinary level of acting,' he said, 'appears
depressed, which I doubt, it is not because of these well-bred and well-
educated ladies and gentlemen. The matter is complicated, however,
by the fact that both these classes, which often overlap, can enter the
profession without any real test of their fitness for it, or any substantial
opportunities for developing the talent they may possess, but on this
head the profession, if not the Playgoers, have had the excellent omen
of last Friday's meeting at Her Majesty's. That meeting, under the
chairmanship of Mr. Tree, was large and unanimous. The old hesitation
about Selection and Training had gone ; and the only fear now is that
out of the enthusiasms of the meeting too much may be attempted. But
the actor begins to concern himself formally and practically with his
own status as a member of a profession; and in our view, a decisive
measure of that sort is worth an infinite deal of academic disquisition."
From all of which it would
appear
that-unless the
majority of the Council join the parties “sitting on the
fence,” waiting for the moss to grow on their eyebrows-at
distant date the question: "Where shall I go for
reliable information, training, and instruction necessary to
equip me as an actor or actress ?” will be capable of being
answered succinctly and finally : “Go to The Actors' Associa-
tion.” Which is a consummation devoutly to be wished.
Another usual question is: “What requirements are
necessary to fit me for the stage, and what amount, if any,
of previous experience in Elocution or amateur acting is
desirable ?" Specific requirements vary widely with the
department of acting chosen for study. Plainness of features,
even eccentricity of appearance are not hindrances in the case
of comedians and character actors. This is a question that
is easier asked than answered. Broadly speaking it is
necessary to be endowed with the artistic temperament;
useful features, that lend themselves readily to effective make-
up; a flexible voice, that is at least clear; much self-
possession, to enable you to develope and make the most of

your resources ; an iron determination, interesting personality
and indomitable industry. It is not necessary to have the
mimetic faculty in any high degree; really good mimics are
usually very poor actors, although exceptions may be found.
Nor is it necessary to be an Apollo or a Helen in personal
appearance, though there are more serious drawbacks than
good looks. Overweening conceit or colossal vanity are not
absolute requirements, their possessors are not invariably
acceptable artists. As to the second part of the question it
may safely be said that it is certainly better to know how to
speak artistically, that is clearly and effectively, than to have
the elements of speech to learn ; and amateur acting, if
indulged in moderately, is not necessarily fatal in its effects.
Other things being equal, I prefer handling people who have
not distinguished themselves as amateurs--the risks of pro-
fessional failure are so much less.

“ How should I go to work to get on the stage ?” is one
of those generic enquiries that lie outside the scope of a
simple treatise of this description. The ways of "getting on
to the stage” are as diverse as the sorts of people who
attempt them, some of whose experiences are instructive.
But however much the ideas of these people may be differen-
tiated in particulars, they appear to be unanimous in their
agreement upon one point. They all think it ought not to cost
anything A country manager of several years standing
recently applied to me as follows:
"DEAR SIR--Can you send me three people, two gentlemen and a
‘lady, pupils of yours, for Summer Stock Season at the Theatre Royal
Shall want them to open the week after next, rehearse next

I will pay them a nominal salary of
for the season of ten weeks; and in the event of their proving
satisfactory, I shall be pleased to engage them in one of my companies
for the Autumn tour, at a commencing salary of thirty shillings, if my
arrangements permit. I should require a premium of twenty guineas
with each person, and would myself supervise their rehearsals.
Yours faithfully

Knowing the man, and the value of a Stock season under
his stage-management, I put the matter before some of my
likelier pupils. These, however, for sufficient reasons could
not accept, so I advertised. Various people made applica-
tion, amongst them a well-looking man of twenty-seven.
Here is the substance of our interview.
“ Have you ever done anything on the stage ?"
“Oh, yes. I have had three months' experience."
" Where ?"
“ At the

“ Indeed. What did you play?”
“Well, I haven't played anything there. You see I just

“Yes. Have you had any other experience; spoken a
line or two anywhere?”
“No; not since I was at school. We had theatricals
there, and I was rather good at it.”
"Have you studied Elocution ?" "
“No; I never went in for that.”
“Know anything about Make-up'?"
I know how to make up.”

“Well, no ; I haven't tried that sort of thing."
« Now, tell me, what kind of parts do you think you are
best fitted for ?"
“Well, I really haven't thought of it. I hardly know
what to say."
“Suppose you were casting, say, The School for Scandal.
What part should you cast yourself for in that piece ?"
“Oh, Charles Surface,"

ELOCUTION AND STAGE TRAINING.
The gentleman, who was perfectly serious, was slightly
under middle height, had sloping shoulders and a clean-cut,
hatchet face that would have helped him to look the part of
Rowley.
“And you wish to follow the stage as a profession ?"
“ Yes.”
“Very well. I will take you in hand and give you twelve
months' training, start you on your professional career, and
get you an engagement for an inclusive fee," which I named.
Then I went on to explain that in the first instance he
would have to go as member of a Stock company for a few
weeks, under an experienced stage-manager, who would give
him some small parts of the "utility” and “responsible"
order in various dramas and melo-dramas ; for which I should
have to pay a premium of twenty guineas, and he would
receive a small sum per week. After this, he would return
to London to take up his studies in real earnest. These I
should be able to supervise to greater advantage, with
the benefit of his experience and the report of his manager.
He would learn Elocution, "Make-up,' Stage 'business,'
Fencing, and anything he might want to know pertaining
to the professional life of the stage. That then I would
obtain another engagement for him, and see that he was well
launched.
The young man appeared utterly bewildered. At length
he asked:
“ Did I understand you to say you had to pay this man a
commission, or premium, or something ?”
“Yes. Twenty guineas is what I should have to pay in
your case.”
“Well, but why should he ask for a premium ? He must
have actors to play his parts."
“Yes; but surely you don't call yourself an actor. This
man is going to begin to teach you your business. Why
should he pay for that luxury? What is your father?”

“A barrister.''
Well, see here. I have a young friend who is a stock-
broker's clerk ; I know he would like to be a barrister. Will
you go and ask your father if he knows anyone who will
read my friend for the Bar until he is called,' pay for his
dinners,' and so on, meanwhile, and guarantee to get him
'briefed,' for the sum I have mentioned to you?”
" Oh, but look at the difference of the earning capacities
of the two professions !"
“Quite true. The average actor generally manages to
support himself by his professional earnings during the first
five years of his work on the stage, while the average
barrister sometines finds it necessary to supplement his
strictly professional income.”
The gentleman is taking a few months in which to “talk
it over with his people”; meanwhile he has graciously given
me permission to write to him if I should have “a similar
opening, preferably in London, later on."
A question that I frequently meet is : “How shall I get a
knowledge of stage-regulations and etiquette ?" And the
answer is simple. By using your eyes and ears, and by
experience. A copy of the stage-regulations enforced at any
given theatre will generally be found posted in a conspicuous
place in the vicinity of the stage, often on or near the Notice
Board. Be careful always to study this latter every time you
enter the theatre ; I have known serious results to follow
from a neglect of this simple rule. No matter how long a a
piece has been running ; no matter what you have learned by
word of mouth from your companions in the dressing-room,
or elsewhere, from the assistant stage-manager, or the
baggage-man, look at the Notice Board. There may be an
official announcement affecting you, a call for rehearsal, an
announcement of a new piece, a “ train call,” anything,
therefore never neglect this precaution. In the matter of
stage etiquette, you need not be apprehensive. Observe what

the best people do, and ask them anything about which you
are not clear.
The sort of letter to write when seeking an engagement
is often a cause of anxiety to the beginner. Let it be brief,
truthful, and business-like. Enclose a photograph with your
name and address clearly written on the back, and a stamped
directed enveloped for reply.
When engaged do not be afraid to ask for a contract or
agreement; no responsible manager will hesitate to give you
one, and the others are rapidly being weeded out—thanks to
the indefatigable Actors' Association, and the newly-formed
Touring Managers' Association. Never neglect the stamping
of an agreement or contract; the cost is trifling, while the
sense of security conveyed by a duly stamped contract is
grateful and comforting.
Agreements or contracts vary much in detail, most of
them being simple-not to say primitive-in form, and the
best are characterised by a commendable brevity. Here is a
sample of an agreement with an actor for a tour :-

Tbe frivolity Tbeatre.
Engagement entered into this 1st day of April, 1902, between
VicesimuS SATIREPROOF, Manager, of the first part, and HORACE
HARDface, Actor, of the second part, both parties agreeing to the
following:
1. Mr. Horace Hardface agrees to perform to the best of his ability
the duties of Stage-manager and to play such parts as may be
allotted to him, and Mr. Vicesimus Satireproof undertakes to
pay for such services a weekly salary of fifteen pounds (£15).
2. The term of the engagement to be six months (twenty-six weeks),
commencing on or about Saturday, May 9th, 1902.
3. The said Horace Hardface agrees to devote his services exclu-
sively to Mr. Vicesimus Satireproof and not to perform else-
where without the consent in writing of Mr. Vicesimus Satire-
proof during the term of this engagement.
4. This contract shall become null and void in case of fire, a national
calamity, or any unforeseen circumstance that may render it
advisable to close the Theatre.
5. In case of Horace Hardface being unable from any cause to duly
perform his part in this agreement, Mr. Vicesimus Satireproof
shall have the right to withhold salary during such period of
inability or neglect.
6. Matinées of the current evening attraction shall be paid for at the
rate of one-twelfth of a week's salary per matinée,

Theatre as an institution, is suggested by a comparison of
the old “Rules and Regulations enforced in most Theatres

meet the requirements of each case. Those I have given are
merely samples, and are not quoted as models. It is not
always necessary to employ a solicitor to read your contracts,
but a member of the Actors' Association need never go short
of the best legal advice when such is required.
The ideas of the uninitiated on the subject of professional
life on the stage are usually simple and vague. Men and
women often come to me with a notion that they would like
to go on at the Lyceum ; they would not altogether object to
the Haymarket or St. James's, but—they would prefer the
Lyceum. When it is pointed out to them that the require-
ments of such theatres are limited as to numbers, and that
their managers only employ artists who know their business
and have some sort of reputation behind them, they express a
moderate surprise-mingled with commiseration—but are
quite sure they would not care to act out of London. I
suggest that there are more theatres out of London than in it,
and that on the whole it might be better to make their mis-
takes elsewhere than at the Lyceum-or even at the St. James's;
they are only half-convinced, and are naturally distrustful of a
man who says he cannot procure them engagements at
theatres of this class. When I go on to tell them of a hard
working little company, touring in the Potteries and the
North with a rough-and-tumble, money-making melodrama,
as the sort of school I should suggest sending them to for a
beginning, they usually go home to talk it over with their
friends."
My reasons for advising every beginner to “go through
the mill” by working through a Stock season or two, if
possible, and certainly not attempting to begin work in a
West-end London theatre, are wholly governed by practical
considerations. There are so many more opportunities of
acting out of London than in it ; you are sure to have a crop
of artistic “ wild oats " to sow before you can hope to come
into the goodly heritage of control of your resources and

227
personality--which will be larger and ranker in propor-
tion as your ability verges upon the least suspicion of genius;
the parts you could hope to get in London would be infinites-
imal and only such as personal fitness or idiosyncracy
warranted, which would have the effect of cultivating such
spots of you as least required it; and you would be
condemned for the rest of your professional life to the inter-
pretation of parts calling for the least possible exertion of
intelligence or artistic power. In a Stock company, playing
a Stock season, on the other hand ; you would have the oppor-
tunity of playing a fresh part every week, perhaps oftener;
you could make your inevitable blunders with less risk of fatal
consequences; the parts you would be cast for would not all
be insignificant, and would be governed as much by financial
considerations as by special personal fitness; and among the
parts you played would probably be one or more which would
have the effect of suggesting the line of business you should
follow-sometimes men are with me in training for twelve
months without being able to determine this point for them-
selves.
Do not join the ranks of those superfine ästhetes of the
stage who affect a fine curl of the lip at mention of “ the old
crusted,' impossible, howling melodramas" that are forever
trotting up and down upon the face of the earth. You can
act in them ; over-act if you like, and, strange to say, they
will stand all your overacting and still survive.
They will
give you breadth, suppleness and a command of your
resources, as nothing else will. They are good enough to
induce people to pay for seeing them too—which is more than
can be said for some modern stuff that is free from the least
suspicion of being Melodrama.
You are not to imagine that these are the easiest com-
panies to enter. The managers of companies travelling with
such pieces as we are considering are very conservative, and
the members of a “crowd ” whose totalled experience

reaches the respectable figure of, say, two hundred and fifty
years, are sometimes apt to regard with jealous eyes the
introduction into their midst of an upstart beginner who is
too inexperienced maybe to conceal the contempt he enter-
tains for the sort of dramatic fare he is too poor an artist to
present acceptably to the public. Remember that experience
and knowledge are to form an important part of your stock-
in-trade as an actor, and that your opinions or your feelings
are of no consequence whatever to people in general and the
audiences to which you play in particular—their only concern
is with your share in the interpretation of the play. If you
are called upon to play in Sweeny Peace the Thug; or, is Life
worth Ending? do your best and be thankful it is not worse-
you might have been condemned to become an accomplice in
giving publicity to, say, Nurse !
If you obtain an engagement in Town, the details of pro-
fessional life will unfold themselves gradually, and any
previous knowledge is almost unnecessary. The matter is
simple ; your stage-manager will see that you are notified of
rehearsals, either by the Notice Board or postcard, and that
you are made acquainted with what is expected of you in any
given part. If in doubt upon any point of business,'
“make-up,” or “dressing," ask him. When a place in a
"
a
dressing-room is allotted you, do not make such mistakes as
behaving as if the whole place belonged to you, appropriating
the best light or the only glass, swaggering about what you
have done, or making an exhibition of your "props" and
“make-up” materials—in other words, do not allow nervous-
ness to cause you to misrepresent yourself. Courtesy,
scrupulous consideration for the feelings of others, unselfish-
ness and modesty, these are the virtues you may safely rely
on to give you popularity with your fellow workers. Display
the ordinary characteristics of a gentleman and you will feel
" at home in the theatre at once. Do not forget you have
joined a great family circle, where your worth will be deter-

mined by what you are, not by what you are paid for the time
being to do.
In going on tour there are many points upon which it is
advisable to have information. In No. i companies, that
remain at least a week in each town visited, you will find
your living expenses much less than in companies that make
three or two night“ stands.” As a rule you can get reliable
addresses for apartments from the business manager, the
baggage-man, the agent in advance, or your fellow members
of the company. Keep an indexed address-book, and put
down every address given you as being good. Never go to
non-professional houses if you can possibly help it; the
people who keep them do not know the little things that are
dear to the heart, and make for the comfort of the actor or
actress. People who let “theatrical lodgings" can seldom
be induced to take any others than “professionals"; they
understand their ways and, except in very rare cases, show
the utmost kindness and consideration to "mummers.'
Travel with necessary luggage only; there is a limit of weight
assigned to each passenger's personal luggage, be careful to
keep well within that limit. Limited baggage means curtailed
expense and anxiety. The baggage-man looks after your
“basket,” and in most companies will see that it is collected
from and delivered at your apartments in the various towns
you visit ; you will give him what the others do, which you
can ascertain by asking them. The management pays all
your travelling expenses after you join the company, and
sometimes pays your fares out and home, but that is a matter
of arrangement about which you will require to have an

industry and self-control. Its exercise will yield you genuine
pleasure and a pecuniary reward that is not more uncertain
than in the case of some other arts, and will offer no hindrance
to the development of your best nature or the cultivation of
the highest virtue—which is benevolence, the desire to
promote the happiness of others. Listen again to Mr.
George R. Sims, speaking to those to whom your service will
be rendered - English-speaking playgoers, the world over.
“The actor lifts us nightly into the region of romance. We leave
life, with its stern realities, its carking cares, behind us when we enter
the playhouse, and we sit even as the children who gather round the fire
when the evening shadows fall and listen with bated breath while some
kind-hearted elder tells them a story. In the playhouse we learn to
weep with those that weep, and to rejoice with those that do rejoice.
We cast aside the cynicism of everyday life within those magic walls,
where the houses have no fronts to shut their secrets from us. In the
playhouse our hearts go out to the beautiful, the tender, and the true,
and in the playhouse we learn from our earliest youth to honour virtue
and to dispise villainy, to applaud brave deeds, and to sympathise with
those who are in peril and distress.
“ There is no pulpit in all the world so powerful for good as the
stage. Night after night upon the boards of our playhouses the great
object lessons of life are unfolded before our eyes. It is to the earnest-
ness of modern actors and actresses of to-day, to the high ideal to which
the actor-managers of to-day have striven to attain, that we are indebted
for the disappearance of the old and obstinate prejudice against the
stage which once flourished in our midst. It is to the same cause we are
indebted for the noble spectacle which the end of the nineteenth century
has vouchsafed to us, that of the church and the stage working side by
side in the best interests of humanity.”
In conclusion I would bid you remember that the secret of
present popularity is always accidental and dependent on
circumstances, but the secret of immortality is always art-
inherent effectiveness. But art must be forgotten before it
can be useful. All your painful, conscious, rigorous training
must be gone through before you can hope to succeed in
anything worthy the name of excellence. The actor should
determine to master his art—or abandon it.
THE END.

STAGE.
“The young actors found favour with a very serious audience, who
had come out of the sunshine to see a tragedy on a bright spring after-
noon.”—Daily Telegraph.
“Splendidly impersonated. Firm, distinct, and bold; he was por-
ticularly successful in showing the art with which lago cloaked his evil
intentions in assumed good-natured heartiness. His bursts of rough
brutality were most cleverly done."--Era.
“Gained the heartiest applause of the afternoon.........besides being
responsible for the stage management, which did everything possible for
the piece, he played the part of the Provost with both breadth and
dignity.........A quiet, thoughtful, intellectual piece of acting.”-Stage.
“The production of.... ..., a one-act drama (by Mr. Ryder), marks
an epoch in what may be called the history of the drama..... ..He has
made a bold bid for success in a difficult enterprise. Judging from the
enthusiasm which has greeted its representation nightly, and that it is
being continued in the bill,.........must be pronounced an unqualified
success."-Sketch.
“Well played, well mounted, and favourably received; it has afforded
a welcome change.”—Referee.
“The engagement which terminates to-night demands more than the
passing comment usually bestowed upon theatrical matters in Chatham.
It is no small risk to bring such a company of actors to a non-theatrical
town, but the triumphant success of the venture justifies its wisdom.
This week the company proved its versatility by playing a brilliant
farcical comedy, which has also crowded the house nightly; and no
wonder, for anything more screamingly funny has never been presented
in this town. We can safely predict an early return visit, and an
enthusiastic welcome.”—Chatham & Rochester News.
(N.B.- The last three notices are of plays written for his pupils by Mr.
Maxwell Ryder, performed over two hundred and fifty nights in
London and nearly a thousand times in the Provinces, and were
the means of introducing twenty-nine pupils to the stage.)
“ It seems a pity that such exquisite work-worthy a Pinero, or
H. A. Jones-should be destined for........., especially considering the
lamentable dearth of really good st-pieces at our West-end theatres.
The play was capitally represented. Mr. Ernest Rumbold acted in an
artistic manner; Miss Frances Waring spoke her lines with graceful
elocution and looked a perfect picture of a beautiful young English lady,
and Mr. MAXWELL RYDER (the author) once more proved himself an artist
to the finger tips, by his restrained and clear-cut acting of the humorous
blackguard, Clement Hardcastle."'-Advertiser.
“Mr. Ernest Rumbold.........touched the hearts of his audience by his
pathetic rendering ......... Miss Frances Waring gave a dainty picture of
the English girl, Enid; Miss Laura Hargraves did good work as the
Spanish beauty, Juanita, managing her broken-English sentences tact-
fully; and Mr. MAXWELL Ryder, the author, once more proved his
capability by his restrained humour as a 'pavement artist,' a blackguard
whose only lament is that he is not as bad as he wants to be.”—Era.
(N.B.-Mr. Ernest Rumbold, for whom the piece was written, Miss
Hargraves, and Mrs. Frances Waring, all pupils of Mr. Maxwell
Ryder),

Copy of portion of a letter from the late SAMUEL BRANDRAM, Esq.,
M.A., to a Gentleman who had been referred to him by Mr. Maxwell
Ryder. (Published by permission).
RICHMOND. Feb. 24th, 1891.
Dear Sir,
I am pleased to have the opportunity of saying what I think of
Mr. Maxwell Ryder as a teacher of Elocution. It has not been my
good fortune to meet many men who have the knack of imparting what
they know to others, particularly in Elocution and stagecraft; but of the
few I have met Mr. Ryder stands amongst the first. His pre-eminence
as a teacher is not to be accounted for by the fact that he is.... ..... All
these things might co-exist in a man without making him a good teacher;
but Mr. Ryder superadds a magnetic personality, a power of crystalline
exposition, and an ability to impart what he knows that are unique in
my experience of the men of the younger generation. You may place
yourself in his hands with confidence.
I am, yours faithfully,
SAMUEL BRANDRAM.

“Remarkable elocution.”—Daily Telegraph.
“His perfect and graceful elocution creating a sensation and interest
that held the audience spell-bound.”—The Liberal.
“The performances of his pupils (at the St. James's Hall) suggest that
Mr. Ryder is a superb teacher. We failed to detect a single trace of
artificiality or mannerism, which is perhaps accounted for by the fact
that Mr. Ryder himself is the simplest and least affected elocutionist we
have ever heard.''-Ibid.
"The building was crowded with a select and appreciative audience,
which fully endorsed the opinions freely expressed as to the elocution-
ist's extraordinary powers. Truly, the mantle of Samuel Brandram
appears to have fallen upon this man's shoulders."-Southend Observer,
“The entertainment throughout was an intellectual treat of the
highest order; humour and comedy gracefully alternating with pathos
and tragedy. We could readily understand the reciter being styled “The
Coming Bellew.'”-Standard.
“Deservedly one of the best known reciters and teachers of elocu-
tion of the present time, and his delivery of the items in his name-
varied though they were—was marked by true dramatic power, superbly
restrained Miss Mr. Ryder's pupil, was heard to great
advantage. The pathos, sweetness, and unaffected charm with which
she invested her work, won her loud and continued applause."--Notting-
ham Guardian.
M. COQUELIN Cadet, the eminent French actor, speaking of his
impressions of English actors and actresses, in the Daily Graphic,
referred to Mr. Ryder in the following words:
“There is no doubt that as a natural gift the majority of your actors
possess distinction of appearance and manner in a very high degree. I
remember seeing...............played in London. There was an actor in it
who played......... (the part sustained by Mr. RYDER), and who surprised
me. English actors possess the gift of being infinitely distinguished,”

" ELOCUTION and STAGE TRAINING,"
BY
MAXWELL RYDER.
Price 5/- Net.
(Postage 4d.)
London:
“ The Era” Offices, 49, Wellington Street, Strand.
EXTRACTS FROM A FEW PRESS OPINIONS
OF THE IST EDITION, 1900.
“Is the best written and most sensible book we have seen for a long
time on a subject that has often lent itself to mere bookmaking. The
mechanical part of elocution is thoroughly dealt with, and there is a very
interesting discussion of the question, how far an actor should actually
feel the emotions he expresses. We do not know where else to look for
so careful an exposition of the art of make-up'as Mr. Ryder gives us. To
the young and aspiring 'mime' this book should be of great service."
Literature.
“Interesting and instructive reading for all connected with pulpit,
platform or theatre, and particularly for those who are inclined towards
the stage. Elocution is an art, and it has a mechanical side, for per-
fection in which Mr. Ryder lays down certain rules that may be studied
with advantage. The book contains also much valuable advice upon such
important matters as make-up, study, rehearsal, and the multitudinous
details comprised in the word business.'”—Referee.
“On what is, perhaps, the most important question as to the actor's
art-should he be controlled by, or should he himself control, his emo-
tions ?- Mr. Ryder has a very definite opinion. If you wish to move
others, always remain master of yourself. And he gives potent argu-
ments, and what is more effective, strong authorities for his opinion.
Generally, his counsels seem to be judicious, as far as an outsider can
judge. Of course, the more purely technical points in preparation for
the stage are dwelt upon and illustrated by anecdote and example. This
is Mr. Ryder's habitual practice. It is instructive to his special public,
and it makes the book more attractive to the outside reader. It takes
us into regions which are unfamiliar to us, and we express an opinion
with diffidence. But our general impression is that it is
work of very
considerable value."-Spectator.
“A thoroughly entertaining and convincing book; full of good argu-
ments and teaching."-Bookman.
“Admirable hints on stage training. Altogether Mr. RYDER has com-
piled a highly interesting volume, full of information for the stage-struck
and replete with matter that appeals alike to player and playgoer.”-
Manchester Evening Mail.
“By MAXWELL RYDER......... a practical teacher of elocution and stage
training......... has a personal knowledge of the modern stage and the
acting profession which enables him to giie sound advice and practical

directions on a variety of matters that claim the attention of the
novice.”—Daily News.
Though most of its teaching will be of service to those who have to
speak or to preach, it is especially intended for those who seek to appear
on the stage. The advice it gives is sound and carefully set forth, while
it has the merit of being the advice of one who has had considerable
experience in training pupils for the stage.”—Scotsman.
“The young player will act wisely in reading Mr. Maxwell Ryder's
book. Perhaps the most useful chapter is the one on the mysterious,
unromantic art of make-up, in which many sadly de-poetising secrets are
given away by a member who understands his subject.”-Sketch.
“ Mr. Ryder has written here a book that will be of the utmost value,
not only to those whom it immediately concerns, but also to public
speakers in other walks of life.”—Literary World.
“This is not merely a valuable text-book for the student, but an in-
teresting book for every reader. Mr. RYDER speaks with the authority
evidently born of experience. The first part of the book will be studied
with profit by all; and the second part, while of immense value to those
already in training, or who contemplate training for the stage, will be
found of deep interest to general readers. The glamour which surrounds
things theatrical will make the chapters on 'make up,' stage business,'
etc., vastly interesting. To the dramatic student, for whom the book is
specially written, the splendid chapters on Management of the Breath,'
• Modulation' and 'Inflexion,' and other subjects too little thought of
nowadays, will be extremely useful. The book is written in clear and
concise style, and is throughout eminently readable.”-Dundee Courier.
“ There is no more competent authority on the subject than Mr. Max
Ryder, and those who wish to become great preachers, powerful public
political orators, or famous histrions cannot possibly do better than
inform themselves of the contents of his admirable book."--Newcastle
Chronicle.
“A most interesting and trustworthy work. Beyond this it is written
in an easy and pleasant style, and is without the stiffness and formality
associated with the text-book.”—Daily Graphic.
“To the lecturer, public speaker, or amateur actor, the volume by
Mr. MaxwELL RYDER......should be of especial value. Mr. Ryder does
not profess to give an easy road to... Success either on the platform or
the stage. His own long practical experience as an actor and as a
teacher of elocution enables him to write with authority on the subject;
and as he has a fluent pen, and a native sense of humour, his book makes
excellent reading, even for those that are not stage-struck.”—Dundee
Advertiser.
“Mr. Ryder, who has had long and successful experience in teaching
elocution and in training for the stage, has here written a helpful book
on the twin subjects which should prove of considerable help to aspi-
rants."-Observer.
“ A book to which aspirants for histrionic fame will rush with eager-
It is safe to say that if the excellent advice which Mr. Ryder lays
down were only followed, audiences would be spared a great deal of the
ranny of bad and indifferent acting which they are at present subjected.
He puts in an eloquent plea for the study of elocution, and all he says as
to stage training generally is evidently inspired by a sincere love of his
art."--Sussex Daily News (Brighton).

“The study and practice of that much-neglected art, elocution, should
receive great encouragement by the issue of this work. It is written by
Mr. Maxwell RYDER, than whom there is no more competent authority
in England, and whose success as a teacher and trainer of public
speakers and actors entitles his dicta to a respectful hearing. The
book should be in the possession of all who aspire to the art of oratory."
- Yorkshire Herald.
“Here, to hand, is a thoughtful and helpful book, written by MAXWELL
Ryder, which contains a fund of information and advice invaluable to
the novice and the student, as well as interesting to the playgoer. Mr.
Ryder writes with the knowledge of experience, and the persuasiveness
of an able and eloquent pen. The necessity for hard and earnest study
is very seriously urged, A number of useful chapters are devoted to
technical hints concerning the mechanical portion of the art of elocution.
Near the end of Mr. Ryder's excellent book he has something to say
upon a matter that crops up from time to time, causes a furious debate,
gives faddists an opportunity to air their ignorance,and occasionally even
tempts those who should know better to deliver themselves of foolish
diatribes. Mr. Ryder deals with the subject lucidly and honestly, and
with that eminent common-sense which is the salient characteristic of
every page in the book. In conclusion we can heartily commend Mr.
Ryder's volume to all who take an interest in the theatre, whether they
be players or playgoers. Within its covers is a rich store of entertain-
ment and instruction. The art of acting is none too brilliant to-day to
make such a work unnecessary. Far from it. We have enough and to
spare of carelessness, misapprehension and unskilfulness on the stage.
•The actor should determine to master his art-or abandon it,' are the
author's final words. His book points out the path that leads to mastery.
Egro, read, mark, and learn.”—Manchester Courier.

“ The player has to do a great deal before he begins to score at all;
even to speak so as to be heard, to be able to walk without clumsiness is
something done. Mr. Maxwell Ryder's name is a good one in this
connection. The writer of the book...... is well known as an instructor of
the young idea. His volume is thoroughly well done......his method
comes from that of Grand School. I can only conclude by saying that
this book is a timely one: it will show the novice how much there is to
learn, it may remind the successful player of some things he has forgotten,
and throughout it shows culture, moderation, and enthusiasm."-Sunday
Sun.
The foregoing excerpts do not pretend to do justice to the reviews
from which they are taken. The Sunday Sun, for instance, devoted two
columns and a half, and The Era a column to tlre consideration and
appreciation of this book.
