PREFACE. 
 
 Iisr this age of book-making, every new treatise 
 should offer an apology for its being. Such an 
 apology may be particularly necessary in the case of a 
 text-book of Elocution. Every " Reader " contains 
 a preface which is supposed to embody the principles 
 of the art of speaking, and there are also special 
 treatises. Most teachers of Elocution, however, pre- 
 fer, very wisely, to arrange their own courses of read- 
 ing for their pupils — associating the practice of 
 reading aloud with the critical study of literature. 
 Having no text-book, the teacher must make his own 
 verbal statement of the principles of Elocution. But 
 students, whether they are boys and girls in prepara- 
 tory schools, undergraduates in colleges, or young 
 people who are fitting themselves for the pulpit or 
 the stage, need constantly before them a concise 
 statement of the rules of their art. 
 
 The " Text-book of Elocution " aims to set forth, 
 upon a scientific basis, the laws of sound as applied 
 to articulate speech. It claims to do away with 
 superfluous and fanciful terms, and reduce the sub-

 ject to its essential principles. Each one of the 
 topics, Pitch, Force, Quality, and Time, is treated 
 from a threefold point of view ; i. e., the physiologi- 
 cal, the physical, and the psychological. A few well- 
 tried exercises for practice are offered under each 
 topic. Brief selections illustrative of each property 
 of tone are also given. A special effort is made to 
 preserve the unity of the subject, while dwelling 
 with sufficient detail upon the working principles of 
 the art embodied in the four topics of the book. In 
 order to insure the practical value of the Text-book, 
 and, at the same time, a comprehensive view of the 
 subject, all unnecessary amplification of topics and 
 examples is avoided. 
 
 The book is not offered as a substitute for a 
 teacher. In no art is the personal skill, experience, 
 and influence of a master of greater value. If the 
 student who is to learn the use of rules must be 
 generously equipped by nature, so must the teacher 
 who is to direct the study and watch over its results. 
 
 While we Americans acknowledge that nature 
 must give place to art in the study of professional 
 speech, we have apparently not yet learned that per- 
 fect colloquial speech cannot be attained without 
 artistic training. " Speaking naturally " often means, 
 in the North, slovenly consonants and muffled vowels ; 
 in the South, vowels somewhat flattened, with sup- 
 pressed consonants ; in the West, harsh and exag-

 gerated consonants and nasal vowels. In order to 
 correct such defects, the earliest lessons in Elocution 
 should be given to the child in the cradle by father, 
 mother, or nurse. " Before all," said Quintilian, 
 " let the nurses speak properly. The boy will hear 
 them first, and will try to shape his words by imitat- 
 ing them." These instructions should be supple- 
 mented by the teacher of Elocution in schools. 
 Indeed, it is perhaps his highest office to improve 
 the e very-day utterance — the " domestic voice " — 
 of the rising generation. The "evolution of the 
 American girl " and boy is incomplete so long as 
 their voices have not been properly tuned and formed. 
 
 It is hoped that the Text-book may be useful in 
 the cultivation of colloquial as well as of professional 
 Elocution. 
 
 The author wishes especially to acknowledge, 
 among other authorities, — such as Bell on Articula- 
 tion and Lanier on Rhythm, — Robert R. Raymond's 
 privately printed work on " Melody in Speech." 
 His former pupils will recognize many of his prin- 
 ciples in the chapter on Melody. He, in turn, 
 acknowledged his indebtedness to Mandeville. The 
 present statement, however, of the laws of melody 
 in speech is the result of the author's experience in 
 teaching. M. P. B.

 HISTORY OP THE ART OP SPEAKING. 
 
 Before entering upon the technical study of Elo- 
 cution, let us glance briefly at its pedigree among the 
 arts. In the ancient world Elocution formed a large 
 part of the study of Eloquence, the two words having 
 a common origin in the Latin verb eloquor. It is only 
 lately that Elocution has been separated from the 
 study of Rhetoric. If we adopt the Latin term, ars 
 dicendi, the art of speaking, as representing every 
 variety of Elocution, we shall find this art associated 
 with some of the noblest traditions of antiquity. 
 Indeed, the art of speaking may be traced back 
 through two distinct lines of descent to the days of 
 Homer and his cycle. 
 
 1. Through the art of oratory, — ecclesiastical, 
 judicial, and political. 
 
 2. Through the art of the theatre. 
 
 With the end of barbarism the history of eloquence 
 and poetry began. Demosthenes in oratory, and

 Sophocles in poetry, represent the two fields of clas- 
 sical elocution. 
 
 The Greek view of the human body as the reflec- 
 tion of the divinity of the soul, prompted him to 
 perfect every part of his physique. A complete 
 physical education must therefore include the devel- 
 opment and perfection of the voice. The aesthetic 
 sense of the Greek taught him, too, that speech in 
 its highest functions — as the instrument of the 
 orator or of the poet — must be ranked among the 
 fine arts. The Greek words rhetor (flowing speaker) 
 and rhapsode (chanter of poems) imply that, from 
 the beginning, speaking was treated as an art, and 
 the speaker as an artist. 
 
 The conditions of government in democratic 
 Athens were admirable for the cultivation of political 
 and judicial oratory. The large body of five hundred 
 senators, and the legislature composed of the entire 
 population of freemen, made public speaking an ab- 
 solute necessity. There must be political leaders and 
 judicial pleaders. With a language formed for the 
 expression of every nicety and beauty of thought, 
 with the bodily instrument pliable and athletic, with 
 cultivated intellect and lofty patriotism, a Demos- 
 thenes seems the natural product of his race and 
 time. 
 
 Antiquity has left us many traditions, and several 
 careful records of the orator's methods of study.

HISTORY OF THE ART OF SPEAKING. 11 
 
 Every student is familiar with the stories of Demos- 
 thenes' practice of articulation by speaking with 
 pebbles in his mouth, of his declaiming while run- 
 ning up hill, in order to improve his respiration, and 
 his study of gesture with the impending sword above 
 his head. The nearest approach to a scientific analy- 
 sis of the art of Elocution is to be found in Qui-n- 
 tilian's " Institutes of Oratory." Cicero, too, left 
 a record of his famous practice, in " De Oratore." 
 These two well-known authorities insist upon the 
 complete education both of mind and character as a 
 part of the preparation for the practice of oratory. 
 The two great orators of antiquity, Demosthenes and 
 Cicero, though they regarded the art of the stage as 
 secondary to their own, did not hesitate to profit by 
 the instructions of actors. " Actors should be judged 
 by their voices, politicians by their wisdom," said 
 Demosthenes ; and said Cicero, " Delivery is to be 
 ordered by action of body, by gesture, by look, and 
 by modulation of the voice ; the great power of which, 
 alone and in itself, the comparatively trivial art of 
 actors and the stage proves." 
 
 In the brilliant fourth century B.C., the art of act- 
 ing became recognized in Greece as an art separate 
 from that of poetry ; the players were organized into 
 a guild known as the "Artists of Dionysus." "The 
 whole of the art of poetry," said a Greek author, 
 "is the praise of the gods." The conception of

 tragedy as an act of worship, together with the ma- 
 terial conditions of the out-door theatre, necessarily 
 modified the elocution and action of the ancient 
 actor. Delicacy of elocution and refinement of pan- 
 tomime would have been useless in such a colossal 
 auditorium. In order to be seen from the most dis- 
 tant parts of the amphitheatre, the actor was obliged 
 to add to his height and size by the use of the 
 cothurnus, liberal padding, and a large mask. It is 
 said that the tragic declamation resembled a deep- 
 toned chant, while the movements were slow and the 
 gestures strongly marked. Power of voice was 
 therefore more important than variety of timbre. 
 Distinct articulation, with perfect rhythmical delivery, 
 was required by the cultivated ear of the Athenian 
 auditor. Hence we hear much about the elaborate 
 education in music necessary for the ancient actor. 
 The Phonascus, or voice-trainer, was most exacting in 
 the practice of scales, and in their application to song, 
 speech, or to the accompanied recitative of the tragic 
 chorus. Sometimes a slave accompanied the actor to 
 the theatre, and gave him the key-note for his first 
 lines. Yet the perversion of this musical train- 
 ing marred the tragic declamation. Ancient actors, 
 like modern " elocutionists," were tempted into the 
 imitation of cries of animals, the roaring of seas, 
 and other meretricious effects. Athens became 
 infested with her " Ranters," who were notori-

 ous for their " bellowing " and " booming." Yet 
 the true art and the true artists happily survived. 
 
 In Greece, as in England, the golden age of histri- 
 onic art was somewhat later than that of dramatic 
 poetry. The material for the actor was, of course, 
 the work of the masters of the drama. 
 
 The Romans were mere imitators in art. While 
 they copied many of the traditions of the Greek 
 theatre, the spirit of Greek tragedy never existed in 
 the Roman genius. 
 
 The name of Roscius, Cicero's friend and tutor, 
 stands for the art of acting among the Romans. 
 
 With the advent of Christianity, the practice of 
 oratory was extended to a field unknown to the 
 ancient world, — the pulpit. In the long conflict 
 between Paganism and Christianity, which culmi- 
 nated in the century of Constantine, there existed 
 perhaps the noblest opportunity ever known for the 
 practice of the art of persuasion. The eloquence of 
 the apostles themselves was succeeded by that of the 
 early Fathers of the Church. The learned Greek 
 and Latin " apologists " for the Christian martyrs 
 used all the rich fruits of pagan culture in behalf of 
 the new philosophy of life. Doubtless Justinian, 
 Origen, Chrysostom, Augustine, inherited the tradi- 
 tions of Cicero and Quintilian, though it is said that 
 the Hebraic conception of the orator as the mouth- 
 piece of divine inspiration probably hindered the pol-

 ished refinement of the art of speaking. Yet the 
 solemn trust to preach the new religion was in itself 
 a great teacher of eloquence. The century of Con- 
 stantine (the fourth of the Christian era) represents 
 the formal triumph of Christianity, and has been 
 called the golden age of Christian eloquence. St. 
 Chrysostom is generally recognized as the master 
 pleader of the new cause. 
 
 After the recognition of Christianity by the em- 
 pire, the art of speaking declined. War displaced 
 the arts of poetry and oratory. The monks kept 
 their cells, contenting themselves with guarding si- 
 lently the precious records of classical learning. 
 With the enthusiasm and fanaticism of the crusad- 
 ers, the monks again became preachers. Though 
 the eloquence of such a man as Peter the Hermit 
 probably lacked the culture of antique models, its 
 results were certainly marvellous. 
 
 With the rise of the modern world came the re- 
 turn to the old arts of peace. During the period of 
 transition from ancient to modern civilization, the 
 history of oratory is rather a history of men and 
 causes than of speaking as a fine art. Doubtless the 
 "revival of learning," the " renaissance," that wonder- 
 ful uprising of the human intellect in the fifteenth, 
 sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, restored, with 
 ancient literature, the traditions of the art of speak- 
 ing. The French, with their passion for order, were

 the first to follow antique models in oratory. The 
 orators of Catholic France, led by Bossuet, in the 
 " century of the Grand Monarch," are said to be the 
 most direct successors of the speakers of antiquity. 
 Bossuet's famous funeral orations had their prototype 
 in the ancient world. 
 
 Let us turn now to the art of speaking, as devel- 
 oped through dramatic poetry. The Church, con- 
 stantly seeking new means for the propagation or 
 restoration of religious enthusiasm, revived in her 
 worship the ancient traditions of the drama. The 
 germs of the so-called Mysteries and Miracle-plays 
 were developed in the dramatic arrangement of music, 
 tableau, and pantomime in the sacred mass. Thus 
 the source, both of the ancient and the modern 
 drama, is found in the idea of worship. 
 
 The marvellous development of the English drama 
 during the age of Elizabeth, and in France under 
 Louis XIV., brought with the dramatic poets profes- 
 sional actors. As in ancient Greece, poet and actor 
 were at first one, — Shakspere and Moliere appeared 
 on the stage as members of their own dramatis per- 
 sonce. The guilds often formed rude dramatic com- 
 panies ; the child choristers of various royal chapels 
 were also utilized as players, until at last Queen 
 Elizabeth and her courtiers attained to their own 
 professional players, under a " Master of the Revels." 
 Plays were also studied and acted at the great uni-

 versities. As early as 1612, Thomas Hey wood gives, 
 in his " Apology for Actors," an estimate of the value 
 of such histrionic training to the undergraduate 
 students. "I, in Cambridge, have seen tragedies, 
 comedies, histories, and shews publicly acted by 
 graduates. It teacheth audacity to the bashful gram- 
 marian, makes him a bold sophister. To come to 
 Rhetoric : it not only emboldens a scholar to speak, 
 but instructs him to speak well and with judgment ; 
 to observe his commas, colons, and full points, his 
 parentheses, his breathing spaces and distinctions ; to 
 keep a decorum in his countenance, neither to frown 
 when he should smile, nor to make unseemly and dis- 
 guised faces in the delivery of his words ; nor to 
 stare with his eyes, draw awry his mouth, confound 
 his voice in the hollow of his throat, or tear his 
 words hastily betwixt his teeth ; neither to buffet his 
 desk like a madman, nor stand in his place like a 
 lifeless image, demurely plodding, and without any 
 smooth and formal motion. It instructs him to fit 
 his phrases to his action, and his action to his phrase, 
 and his pronunciation to them both." It is apparent 
 that Heywood, like Cicero and Demosthenes, knew 
 what the actor and orator might learn from each 
 other. Their study of the art of speaking must, up 
 to a certain point, be identical. In Hamlet's direc- 
 tions to the players (Act III., sc. 2), Shakspere 
 gives his own summary of tne requirements for good

 acting, in speech and in pantomime. Hamlet implies 
 that the art, even then, was sadly in need of reform. 
 
 The history of English dramatic elocution may be 
 traced in a succession of great names. Even before 
 Shakspere left the stage we read of the famous 
 Burbage and the fascinating Tarleton. Betterton 
 was the great actor of the Restoration, while Garrick 
 and Mrs. Siddons made the eighteenth century the 
 golden age of acting in England. The nineteenth 
 century, however, adds no mean names to the record, 
 — Henry Irving and Ellen Terry in England, Edwin 
 Booth, Joseph Jefferson, and Charlotte Cushman in 
 America. 
 
 In any comparison of ancient and modern acting, 
 one must recognize the vast change in thought 
 brought about by Christianity. Man, in Shak- 
 spere's day, was no longer the creature of the gods, 
 rewarded or punished by Fate, but a free agent work- 
 ing out his own destiny. Shakspere stated the 
 new law of life when he made Cassius say, that man's 
 fate was not in his star, but in himself. In other 
 words, the interest of the new drama was centred in 
 character and its various manifestations. To inter- 
 pret all the shades and contrasts of character, with 
 the variety of situation involved in such dramatic 
 themes, must tax to the uttermost the genius and 
 skill of the actor. His elocution and pantomime must 
 show far greater delicacy and subtlety than that of

 the ancient actor. As the theatres were small and 
 enclosed, less power of voice, with more flexible decla- 
 mation, was required. 
 
 With this necessity for careful training, the Eng- 
 lish genius has never recognized the need of a sys- 
 tematic school for actors. It is true that the custom 
 prevailed in the early history of the stage for a lead- 
 ing actor to take a number of apprentices. But the 
 art has relied chiefly upon its oral traditions, which 
 have been handed down hap-hazard from one genera- 
 tion of actorg to another. It has thus often hap- 
 pened that English actors have never unlearned their 
 own eccentricities, and in some cases the defects of 
 genius have been copied as excellences by servile 
 imitators. While it is folly to suppose that genius 
 should reproduce itself, it has been proved in France 
 that the great actors of the national theatre have had 
 a direct influence in " forming " their successors. 
 While the English stage can boast quite as many 
 "names to conjure with" as the French, unquestion- 
 ably the general standard of excellence in the pro- 
 fession is lower in England than in France. There 
 the art has been systematically taught for nearly two 
 centuries. The Theatre Frangais was rooted in a 
 school as early as 1784, when the " National Conser- 
 vatory of Declamation" was founded. 
 
 The conditions of modern life have modified the 
 art of oratory as well as that of the stage. Aristotle

 said that there were three instruments of Rhetoric: 
 (1) the ethical, (2) the pathetic, (3) the logical. 
 It is said that ancient orators, before Aristotle, used 
 most freely the element of pathos ; that is, they did 
 not hesitate to appeal, often unscrupulously, to the 
 emotions of the crowd. Modern orators, especially 
 those of Teutonic descent, limit themselves, says the 
 same authority, to the effects of logic ; that is, they 
 move by the power of the syllogism rather than by 
 an appeal to the feelings. These limitations of 
 modern eloquence refer particularly to the oratory of 
 politics or of the courts. In parliamentary assem- 
 blies the delivery of a speech is often a mere form, 
 its value depending upon the accuracy with which it 
 is " reported " in the newspapers for the speaker's 
 " constituents." Under such conditions excellence 
 of delivery must be of less importance than accu- 
 racy and power of thought. Eloquence thus loses 
 its original meaning ; it is no longer vocal but 
 literary. This ascendency of literary eloquence over 
 the ars dicendi represents, perhaps, the most re- 
 cent state of the art. At the close of the last and 
 in the beginning of the present century, England, 
 France, and America produced notable orators. The 
 mighty question of the social rights of man, which 
 was then making the history of the three peoples, 
 must needs produce its advocates. The names of 
 Mirabeau, Burke, and Webster stand for the cause of

 liberty. Mr. Gladstone's glowing eloquence has 
 been called out by every vital theme, and is one 
 more proof of the superiority of the speaking man to 
 his printed page, even in this age of newspapers. 
 
 The later struggles for liberty in America pro- 
 duced Sumner and Phillips. These men were self- 
 taught speakers. Wendell Phillips said that the 
 secret of his power was " the burning love of truth 
 that must come out." 
 
 The greatest opportunity of the modern orator, the 
 pulpit, has in recent times been shamefully neglected 
 or misused. That there are grave errors in the teach- 
 ing of Elocution is apparent from the unmannerly 
 reading of devotional hymns, and the uncouth eccen- 
 tricities of most pulpit-elocution. Nevertheless, one 
 must not forget the noble pulpit-oratory of John 
 Henry Newman in England, and of Henry Ward 
 Beecher in America. They represent two distinct 
 types of oratory, yet they both knew how to move 
 men. 
 
 The history of the art of speaking would be incom- 
 plete without some reference to its colloquial prac- 
 tice. The best British talkers of our own day, men 
 like Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Goschen, Matthew Arnold, 
 Robert Browning, have succeeded in keeping that 
 happy balance of dignity which has been described as 
 " knowing how to be easy without being free and 
 easy." This apparently unstudied eloquence of the

 drawing-room and the club is the result of thorough 
 culture and consummate art. The " accent of a gentle- 
 man," which characterizes high-bred English speech, 
 is the result of long and careful training. Unfortu- 
 nately in America it is often neglected, even in fam- 
 ilies of education and culture. 
 
 We have seen how laboriously the ancients discov- 
 ered the laws of effective speech, and how studiously 
 they applied these laws. In modern times we exalt 
 the theme, and ignore the means of ably presenting it ; 
 and this when the art of Elocution rests upon a scien- 
 tific basis utterly unknown to the ancient world. 
 Instinct and enthusiasm should be tutored by art, in 
 order to make the platform, the pulpit, and the thea- 
 tre worthy of the noble traditions of the past.

 ELOCUTION -VOCAL PHYSIOLOGY. 
 
 Definition. — We have followed, in the Introduc- 
 tion, the history of the art of speaking, under the 
 various forms of oratory, dramatic declamation, elo- 
 quence, elocution, from the Acropolis of Athens to 
 the drawing-rooms of America. In treating of the 
 art, we shall adopt the word elocution as best suited 
 to our purpose: it is simply the Latin ars dicendi (the 
 art of speaking) applied either to professional or to 
 colloquial speech. 
 
 The art of speaking, as used by the ancients, in- 
 cluded the perfect use of the voice and of the whole 
 body as instruments for the expression of the highest 
 forms of thought. Speech and Action — Elocution 
 and Pantomime — were then, as now, the special 
 subjects to be studied by the artistic speaker. The 
 ancient teachers also insisted upon a liberal education 
 of mind and character as a part of the preparation 
 for effective speaking. Though Rhetoric, Elocution, 
 and Pantomime are so intimately associated, each 
 subject must now receive separate and special 
 treatment. Rhetoric has already been specialized, 
 though the art of Pantomime has, until lately, never

 received adequate and expert attention. The art of 
 Pantomime does not belong exclusively to the pro- 
 fession of Acting. This popular superstition has done 
 much harm to the art of speaking. A knowledge of 
 the laws of facial expression, of attitude, and of ges- 
 ture — the pantomime of the whole body — is equally 
 essential for the actor, the preacher, and the talker. 
 As has been ably said, " The body is a house of many 
 windows ; there we all sit showing ourselves and 
 crying on the passers-by to come and love us." No 
 man or woman is completely cultivated unless he 
 knows how to use his body as an instrument perfectly 
 attuned to the " cries " of the mind and the soul. The 
 study of the principles and practice of Pantomime 
 should therefore accompany the study of Elocution. 
 
 Subdivisions of the Subject of Elocution. — Elocution, 
 in its restricted sense, must deal with the voice from 
 several points of view, — the physiological, the phy- 
 sical, the psychological. The voice is a part of our 
 physiological structure ; it is also a tone-producing 
 instrument ; it is, as articulate speech, the direct ex- 
 ponent of thought ; and, as musical sound, the accu- 
 rate registrar of emotion. 
 
 Vocal Physiology. — The first lesson in Elocution 
 must then be a brief study in vocal physiology. The 
 parts of the body concerned in speech are : 
 
 The Head, 
 The Throat, 
 The Chest.

 The chest deals directly with respiration, the throat 
 with vocalization, the head with articulation. In the 
 three processes of respiration, vocalization, and articu- 
 lation are embodied respectively the body, the soul, 
 and the mind of speech. 
 
 The Chest. — The organs of the chest concerned in 
 respiration are : — 
 
 Diaphragm, 
 
 Costal and Dorsal Muscles, 
 
 Lungs, 
 
 Bronchial Tubes. 
 
 Chest. 
 
 The diaphragm is a powerful but elastic muscle 
 which forms the floor of the chest ; the dorsal muscles 
 form the back, while the costal muscles make the 
 front and sides of the chest. Within these walls of 
 the chest, which are supported by the bony frame- 
 work of spine and ribs, are the lungs with their

 is somewhat triangular in shape, being outlined in 
 front by the acute angle of the thyroid, or shield- 
 shaped cartilage, and at the back by the cricoid, or 
 seal-ring-shaped cartilage. From the angle of the 
 thyroid cartilage to the cricoid cartilage are stretched 
 two parallel cartilaginous bands known as the vocal 
 cords or ligaments. These ligaments are attached 
 to the cricoid cartilage by two little cartilages called 
 the arytenoid or pyramidal-shaped cartilages. The 
 opening between the cords is called the glottis. 
 The epiglottis is a leaf-shaped cartilage situated at 
 the upper part of the larynx ; to its base is attached 
 the root of the tongue. The pharynx is a chamber 
 having fleshy walls, and situated directly over the 
 larynx, with openings into the mouth and nasal pas- 
 sages. The anatomy and physiology of the larynx 
 are very complex and delicate. Only the details 
 necessary for an intelligent use of the organ are

 practising, by the action of involuntary muscles, since 
 the day of birth. But as artistic respiration, unlike 
 mere vital inhalation and exhalation, is a distinctly 
 voluntary process, it must be carefully understood 
 and deliberately practised. Without such practice, 
 beauty of voice and elegance of articulation are im- 
 possible. The air which is inhaled by the speaker 
 through the nose and mouth, descends through the 
 pharynx, larynx, and wind-pipe to the lungs. The 
 dilation of the air-cells with the in-rushing of the air 
 is accomplished by the simultaneous expansion of the 
 diaphragm, costal and dorsal muscles. As the lungs 
 are filled with air, the diaphragm descends to its low- 
 est position, and the muscular walls of the chest are 
 distended. With the impulse to speak, the diaphragm 
 rises towards its normal position, the walls slowly 
 relax their tension, until, when the air is entirely ex- 
 pelled, diaphragm, costal and dorsal muscles attain 
 their normal position. There is always a residue of 
 so-called vital breath in the lungs, even after the most 
 exhaustive artistic use of breath. 
 
 Vocalization. — The column of air expelled from 
 the lungs strikes the vocal cords. This stroke of 
 the confined air, assisted by the muscles of the larynx, 
 causes a vibration of the vocal ligaments, which pro- 
 duces a musical tone. The varying tension and 
 relaxation of the cords, together with the vibration 
 of the air in the different chambers of the throat and

 head, produce an infinite number of changes in the 
 key and force of tone. It is evident that the human 
 voice partakes of the nature of both a wind and a 
 stringed or reed instrument. But the adjustments 
 are so flue as to make possible the effects of both 
 instruments, — effects which are impossible in the 
 orchestra. A flute must always remain a flute ; an 
 organ, an organ ; a violin, a violin. In the human 
 voice, one can produce the tone-colors of all these 
 instruments, wonderfully blended or contrasted. The 
 pharynx and certain parts of the larynx, the mouth 
 and the nose, form a series of resonators, or sounding- 
 boards, for the voice. These cavities both multiply 
 and shape the vibrations, thus regulating the power 
 and the quality of the voice. As the walls of the 
 pharynx are elastic, it is particularly adapted to the 
 moulding of tone. 
 
 Articulation. — As the tone issues from the pharynx, 
 it is shaped by the mouth and nose into definite 
 vowel forms, or it is cast into consonants by the 
 rapid closing and opening of the tongue, teeth, 
 palate, or lips. While studying in detail the pro- 
 cesses of respiration, vocalization, and articulation, 
 the student should remember that in practice, the 
 action of the physical mechanism is an almost in- 
 stantaneous and simultaneous response to the dictum 
 of the brain.

 varieties of artistic respiration may be classified as 
 follows : — 
 
 ! Vocal, 
 Logical, 
 Emotional. 
 
 Vocal respiration is a controlled and measured use 
 of the breath for the purpose of producing beauty 
 and power of tone. In correct vocal respiration, the 
 words seem poised on the column of breath. The 
 steady, measured flow of air forms and sustains the 
 succession of vowels and consonants. A good illus- 
 tration is found in the following description of the 
 " Summer of All-Saints " in Acadia : — 
 
 " Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the 
 landscape 
 Lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood. 
 Peace seemed to reign upon earth ; and the restless heart of 
 
 the ocean 
 Was for a moment consoled. " 
 
 Evangeline : Longfellow. 
 
 Logical respiration is respiration used to aid in the 
 interpretation of thought. The pauses for breath in 
 the delivery of a sentence must be so arranged as to 
 help rather than hinder the expression of the ideas. 
 Sometimes it will not be necessary to take breath at 
 every rhetorical pause, but the sustaining of breath 
 throughout a series of short phrases requires as much 
 skill as the measured exhalation of breath for a long

 phrase. The skilful reader will supply himself with 
 breath for a long phrase or a short phrase, according 
 to the grouping of words in the sentence. The logi- 
 cal pause and the logical respiration are evidently 
 closely associated. But as the study of pause be- 
 longs more accurately to the subject of Time, it will 
 be treated more fully under that topic.

 the soul not with the essential religious sentiment, not with a drop 
 of the tincture of worship, but making us feel, one by one, all those 
 original elements of which worship is composed.' ' 
 
 Fireside Travels : James Kussell Lowell. 
 
 Emotional respiration is such an artistic use of in- 
 halation, suspension, or exhalation of breath as to 
 convey emotion. Thus, calm, labored, or spasmodic 
 respiration may suggest different states of mind. A 
 deliberate and audible inhalation is indicative of en- 
 durance, either enforced or heroic. Enforced endur- 
 ance is shown in Cassius's respiration as he exclaims 
 to Brutus (Act IV., 3) : — 
 
 " O ye gods, ye gods ! Must I endure all this ? "

 Heroic endurance is implied in Macbeth's respira- 
 tion as he cries out : —

 A prolonged exhalation suggests an element of 
 
 confidence or affection : —

 The whisper is the simplest form of speech. As 
 the air issues from the trachea, it passes through the 
 glottis (the vocal cords remain relaxed) into the 
 pharynx and thence into the mouth, where it is 
 articulated. As there is no vibration of the vocal 
 cords, a strong and well-governed supply of breath 
 is necessary in order to make the whisper audible. 
 The use of the whisper is, therefore, an excellent 
 exercise for students. The preceding examples of the 
 different kinds of respiration may be practised first 
 in a whisper. 
 
 Preliminary Exercises in Respiration. — 1. Slow inha- 
 lation, suspension, and exhalation of breath ; syllables 
 sh and buzz. 
 
 2. Quick but thorough inhalation, as in speaking 
 or singing, suspension of breath, and slow exhalation ; 
 the same syllables. 
 
 Repeat each exercise several times with care. Use 
 the exclamations Push! Pull! Puff! with different 
 kinds of energy, first in a whisper, then aloud.

 Simple pantomime may accompany each utterance. 
 Thus, while speaking the word, push a chair steadily 
 and slowly across the room, or lift a weight in each 
 hand from the horizontal to the perpendicular. The 
 objects may be real or imaginary, but the action should 
 be definite. Pull a bell by a rope attached to the 
 clapper, with vigorous inhalation and explosive utter- 
 ance of the word " Pull ! " Keep a feather floating 
 in the air, or blow a soap-bubble gently and keep it 
 suspended in the air by careful and quiet exhalation, 
 saying again and again, " -Puff, puff! " " Toss " and 
 " Catch " may also be used. One student may toss 
 an imaginary ball to another student at the opposite 
 side of the room. The word should be suited to the 
 action. Sentences should be read at sight by one 
 member of the class to the others, as a test of his 
 correct use of respiration. 
 
 Vocalization in its Relation to Speech. — In theory, the 
 acts of vocalization and of articulation are distinct 
 processes, but, in practice, they are so intimately asso- 
 ciated that it is difficult to treat them separately. In 
 both processes we are dealing with the elements of 
 speech, — vowels and consonants. Philologists agree 
 that the first vocal utterances of man were probably 
 vowels. Thus, such exclamations as Oh ! Ah ! Ugh ! 
 may be made expressive of many primitive material 
 wants by a very simple vocal process. Short u (as 
 in tub) in English has been called the "natural vowel,"

 because it is produced by the easiest opening of the 
 mouth and pharynx, with the vibration of the vocal 
 cords. The consonants are the result of a much 
 more elaborate mental and physical action than the 
 vowels. 
 
 Professor Bell classifies the elements of spoken 
 language as Vowels, Glides, and Consonants or Articu- 
 lations. A Vowel, scientifically speaking, is a musical 
 tone produced in the larynx, and fixed in form by the 
 shape of the mouth. A Vowel retains its form through- 
 out its duration ; as a in f a-ther. 
 
 A Glide is a transition from one Vowel form to an- 
 other during the same impulse of breath; as a in 
 ba-ne.

 open vowel sounds, such as ah, uh, awe. All students 
 who can discriminate note from note should practise 
 these vowels with the musical scale. Even those who 
 have very little " ear" can usually make at least three 
 notes with the correct intervals. 
 
 1. Uh, Ah, Awe. Beginning with B-flat (below 
 middle C on the piano) sing first three, then five, 
 then eight notes up and down the scale. Utter the 
 notes with a light " staccato," first with an inhalation 
 before each note, then with one inhalation for the 
 groups of three, five, or eight notes. 
 
 2. After the " staccato " practice, sustain the vowel 
 sounds with a prolonged " legato," taking breath be- 
 fore each vowel. 
 
 3. Use the words, push, pull, and puff, prolonging 
 the vowels, first from E-flat downwards, then rapidly, 
 and " staccato" downwards to B-flat, and upwards to 
 E-flat. 
 
 4. Chant such expressions as Move slowly, Walk 
 quietly, Stand firmly, Step lightly, on the four notes 
 mentioned. 
 
 5. Speak the same words, bearing in mind the dif- 
 ferent keys used, while retaining the inflections of 
 speech. 
 
 6. Continue the exercise of chanting, on long sen- 
 tences, grouping the words according to the require- 
 ments of logical respiration. Thus (to be first

 Articulation in its Relation to Speech. — A Consonant, 
 
 or, more strictly, an Articulation, is an emission of 
 
 breath or voice (oral or nasal) which is obstructed 
 
 for an instant at some fixed point in the mouth. 
 
 The Articulation (Consonant) is composed of two 
 
 parts, says Professor Bell, a position followed by an 
 
 action. The firm holding of the position and the 
 
 prompt relaxation of the hold are equally essential 
 
 for distinct and elegant articulation.

 The utterance of a consonant is evidently a more 
 complicated process than the formation of a simple 
 vowel. It is said that the characteristic cries of ani- 
 mals are vowel sounds unaccompanied by consonants.

 Thus the B-a-a-a of the sheep is, to the accurate lis- 
 tener, merely A-a-a-h. The formation of B is too 
 complex an act for the mind and mouth of the sheep. 
 The parrot and certain rare birds can acquire by 
 imitation some of the articulations, but they cannot be 
 said to use intelligently articulate speech. 
 
 The vowels represent the blood, the consonants the 
 bones of speech, says Richard Grant White. In other 
 words y the vowels are pre-eminently the sensuous, 
 the consonants the intellectual, elements of speech. 
 It is possible to construct a scale representing the 
 relative values of the vowels and the consonants. 
 As in the spectrum of colors every hue is blended 
 perfectly from violet to red, so in speech we 
 pass imperceptibly from the penetrating, incisive e, 
 through the sympathetic #A, to the impassioned or 
 heroic o and oo. In the scale of consonants we 
 recognize at one extreme the " keen-cut, thoughtful 
 p and £, and at the other, the explosive, guttural, pas- 
 sionate &." The poets and skilled prose-writers are 
 masters in their selection of the vowels and conso- 
 nants whose sound is most closely fitted to the sense. 
 Indeed, the arrangement of the tone-colors of vowels 
 and consonants constitutes a large part of the tech- 
 nique of poetry. The timbre of the notes of speech 
 will be considered more fully under Quality of Voice.

 should not be taken as the final authority for accent 
 or utterance. The only absolute guide for the pro- 
 nunciation of a living language is the usage of the 
 cultivated classes. In England, those classes are tol- 
 erably well defined; namely, the professors in the 
 universities, men of letters, the clergy, and the nobil- 
 ity. In France, the Academy and the Theatre 
 Fran§ais fix the standards of pronunciation. In 
 America, we have no definite canon of usage. It 
 is perhaps safe to say, however, that, in the larger 
 cities, representatives of the clerical and the legal 
 professions, men of letters and college professors, may 
 be trusted to establish best usage in pronunciation. 
 
 In order to secure an elegant pronunciation, all 
 provincialisms must be absolutely abandoned. Un- 
 accented syllables should be carefully uttered — not 
 with pedantic nicety, however; the vowels should be 
 given their correct sound, though they should some- 
 times be slightly obscured in colloquial speech ; the 
 consonants should be accurately but lightly sounded. 
 The Century Dictionary has adopted an ingenious 
 system of marking to distinguish authorized collo- 
 quial, from more formal, pronunciation. 
 
 Preliminary Exercises in Articulation and Pronunciation.

 consonant.

 sonants, (1) in a whisper, (2) audibly.

PITCH. 39 
 
 III. 
 
 PITCH. 
 
 The physical properties of tone are : — 
 
 ( Pitch, 
 Tone. < Force, 
 ( Quality. 
 
 In the consideration of the voice, as used in speaking, 
 the element of Time must also be treated. 
 
 Pitch of sound, whether produced by the voice or 
 by any other instrument, depends upon the rapidity 
 of vibrations, force upon the amplitude, quality upon 
 the form of vibrations. In the human voice, pitch is 
 regulated chiefly by the lengthening and shortening of 
 the glottis, with the elasticity of the vocal cords. 
 The supply of breath must be accurately adjusted to 
 the notes of the musical scale. Thus, the lower notes, 
 produced by fewer vibrations per second, require less 
 breath than the upper notes. The musical scale is 
 used for convenience of practice in speaking, though 
 the actual intervals of speech are much shorter than 
 those of singing. Sidney Lanier, who was both poet 
 and musician, declares that, in the gamut of speech, 
 


## p. 40 (#44) ##############################################

40 A TEXT-BOOK OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 it is possible to detect at least nine tones in the inter- 
 val called in music a " whole tone." Thus the effect 
 of greater extremes of pitch is gained by a narrower 
 range of notes than in singing. The octave divided 
 by middle C on the piano will <jover most of the exi- 
 gencies of speech for the woman's voice, the range of 
 the average male voice being an octave below. 
 
 Pitch as applied to Speech. — It is said that every action 
 in nature has its key-note, — the purring of the breezes 
 over the mountain-sides in summer, the sighing and 
 groaning of the pine forests in winter, the rustle of the 
 corn-fields, the thunder of the waters. The funda- 
 mental note of Niagara has been fixed in musical no- 
 tation, and the key and melodies of birds' songs have 
 been actually written down by careful listeners. The 
 poet, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, has admirably expressed 
 this idea of a key-note which pervades the life of the 
 woods, the sea, and the streets : — 
 
 " Listen alone beside the sea, 
 Listen alone among the woods; 
 Those voices of twin solitudes 
 
 Shall have one sound alike to thee. 
 Hark where the murmurs of thronged men 
 Surge and sink back and surge again, — 
 
 Still the one voice of wave and tree. 
 
 Gather a shell from the strown beach 
 And listen at its lips: they sigh 
 The same desire and mystery, 
 
 The echo of the whole sea's speech ; 
 And all mankind is thus at heart,

 Not anything but what thou art : 
 And Earth, Sea, Man are all in each." 
 
 The Sea-Limits. 
 
 Every man and woman speaks in his or her charac- 
 teristic pitch of voice. Every conversation or address 
 has a definite key. This pitch may be heard through- 
 out the conversation, independent of the rise and fall 
 of the voice in the cadence of phrases. Thus, the 
 theme of a conversation heard in an adjoining room 
 can be told by the key which strikes the ear, even 
 when words are lost. The changes of key are 
 gradual, — ascending or descending the scale from 
 the key-note. The transition is also often very abrupt. 
 These modulations of key are governed by the modi- 
 fications of the thought or sentiment. It follows, 
 therefore, that the closer the apprehension of the 
 thought or sentiment, the richer and more refined 
 will be the modulations of pitch. The trained speaker 
 or reader will always, however, observe the laws 
 which underlie the use of pitch. A low note is ex- 
 pressive, in general, of serious, solemn thought or 
 emotion. The voice rises to the medium notes of 
 the scale in the expression of gentle, controlled emo- 
 tion or abstract thought, and it ascends towards the 
 upper limits of the scale in the utterances of anima- 
 tion, joy, ecstasy. If the original pitch of the voice 
 is too high or too low to accommodate itself readily 
 to these laws, it should, with due care, be trained up 
 or down the scale. 
 


## p. 42 (#46) ##############################################

42 A TEXT-BOOK OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 The key-note of any discourse having been deter- 
 mined, the artistic speaker will be careful to keep all 
 the modulations within the harmonic intervals of that 
 musical key. Otherwise the effects of transition will 
 be discordant, and the thought or sentiment distorted. 
 This law should be carefully observed at the begin- 
 ning of new sentences, paragraphs, or stanzas. 
 
 The laws of pitch are equally applicable to every 
 variety of discourse, — to the conduct of familiar con- 
 versation, to the persuasion of the orator, to the in- 
 tensity of dramatic expression. 
 
 While the changes in pitch are indicative of many 
 subtle moods of mind, it will be found that pitch is 
 the property of tone which responds most directly to 
 the reasoning processes ; it represents the intellect 
 of the voice. This special function of pitch will be 
 more apparent in the study of the melodies or tunes 
 of speech. 
 
 Examples. — Let the student decide upon the proper 
 key of each selection, testing the note by chanting a 
 few words before reading. The listeners should 
 decide whether the speaker has accurately followed 
 the chosen key while reading.

 Higher still and higher 
 
 From the earth thou springest

 To a Sky-Lark : P. B. Shelley. 
 " There is a feeling in heroic poetry or in a burst of eloquence 
 that I sometimes catch in quite different fields. I caught it this 
 morning, for instance, when I saw the belated trains go by, and 
 knew how they had been battling with storm, darkness, and dis- 
 tance, and had triumphed. The moving train is a proud spectacle, 
 especially in stormy and tempestuous nights. When I look out 
 and see its light, steady and unflickering as the planets, and hear 
 the roar of its advancing tread, or its sound diminishing in the 
 distance, am I comforted and made stout of heart. O night, where 
 is thy stay ! O space, where is thy victory ! " 
 
 Touches of Nature : John Burroughs. 
 
 " The night wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and 
 round [an old church], and moaning as it goes; and of trying, with 
 its unseen hand, the windows and doors. And when it has got in, 
 as one not finding what it seeks, whatever that may be, it wails 
 and howls to issue forth again; and not content with stalking 
 through the aisles, and gliding round and round the pillars, and 
 tempting the deep organ, soars up to the roof, and strives to 
 rend the rafters; then flings itself despairingly upon the stones 
 below, and passes, muttering, into the vaults."

 Pitch — The Melodies of Speech. — Having studied the 
 general laws of pitch as regulated by the theme and 
 its modifications, let us now consider the changes 
 in pitch caused by the more intimate relations of 
 thought in the succession of words in a sentence. 
 As in music, the general theme determines the key-

 note ; the sequence of ideas makes the melodies or 
 inflections of speech. In studying the melodies of 
 speech, one is confronted by limitations which are 
 unknown in music. Language is, to a certain ex- 
 tent, a conventional tool for the conveyance of 
 thought, though philologists are able to account for 
 the history of words by some natural law of growth 
 in civilization. The speaker, however, must accept 
 the words of a language as the symbols of ideas. 
 With the words of a spoken language are associated, 
 by long usage, certain definite arrangements of notes 
 or melodies. It is, indeed, the melody of the spoken 
 tongue which makes it live. Latin and Greek are 
 "dead" languages because we no longer know the 
 cadences or tunes of the idiom with which we may 
 be perfectly familiar on the printed page. French or 
 Italian, though pronounced accurately, is not true 
 French or Italian if the native melodies are not 
 associated with the acquired words. It is the diffi- 
 culty of learning, with the new words of a language, 
 the new tunes of speech, which makes it almost im- 
 possible for an alien ever to speak perfectly an 
 acquired tongue. The variations of the English 
 language, as spoken in England, Ireland, Scotland, 
 and America, are due not only to differences of pro- 
 nunciation, but also to slight variations in the tunes 
 of familiar speech. It should be noticed, however, 
 that among cultivated speakers in Great Britain and

 the United States, both in public and in private life, 
 there is a marked resemblance in the melodies of 
 speech. Taking this body of men and women as our 
 standard of "best usage," both for pronunciation and 
 melody, let us proceed to analyze some of the most 
 familiar tunes of colloquial speech. These colloquial 
 melodies underlie the interpretation of the noblest 
 flights of eloquence or the most refined delineations 
 of character. No actor can read the lines of Lear or 
 Hamlet, no speaker can follow Webster or Phillips 
 Brooks, without an accurate knowledge of the tunes 
 of the best every-day talk. 
 
 The voice may rise or fall by short or long inter- 
 vals throughout the scale. In speaking, the voice 
 invariably glides from one note to another, while in 
 singing it moves generally by marked transitions 
 from note to note. In singing, the vowels are often 
 prolonged; the sensuous element of speech (the 
 vowel) is thus made more prominent than in speak- 
 ing. In uttering the melodies of speech there must 
 be a perfect adjustment of vowels and consonants. 
 The slightest over-doing of the vowels is an abomina- 
 ble affectation, while the slurring of consonants is an 
 equally unfortunate habit.

 note, or some harmonically related note. The chant, 
 recitative, or monotone follows the key-note or 
 one of its harmonic intervals. It is, as used in the 
 opera or the liturgy of the church, a connecting link 
 between song and speech. Its special function in 
 speech will be explained hereafter. The rise of the 
 voice is suggestive of a certain trend of thought ; its 
 fall, of another definite tendency of mental action. 
 Its rise and immediate fall form the peculiar melody 
 of emphasis or forcible expression. These melodies 
 constitute a vocal logic. They are, of course, modified 
 by the changing conditions of thought ; and the stu- 
 dent must consider the principal variations upon the 
 original melodies as he would the exceptions to a rule 
 of grammar or rhetoric. 
 
 The melodies of speech, which are simply success- 
 ive changes in pitch, are the direct exponents of 
 thought. The child who is learning to read, as well 
 as the student of Elocution, should master at the out- 
 set the familiar tunes of thought. The usual reading 
 of a child or an illiterate person (Pomona's, for ex- 
 ample, as described by Mr. Stockton in " Rudder 
 Grange ") is tuneless. " This-is-a-dog " is merely a 
 series of words without the accompanying music of 
 their utterance. 
 
 Preliminary Exercises in Melody. — 1. Practise the 
 vowels with the monotone, i.e., with long, sustained 
 notes up and down the scale. 
 


## p. 47 (#51) ##############################################

PITCH. 47 
 
 2. Group the sounds in two's, taking breath before 
 each group. 
 
 3. Speak words containing large, open vowels (such 
 as large, aive, round, sonorous^), (1) with rising inflec- 
 tions, short and long ; (2) with falling inflections ; 
 (3) with the rise and fall of voice combined. 
 
 4. Count from 1 to 10 up and down the speaking 
 scale. 
 
 Laws of Melody. — I. The monotone, which is sim- 
 ply an absence of melody, is used in speech to indi- 
 cate the suppression of mental activity in the presence 
 of strong emotion. The monotone may suggest awe, 
 deference, or the other extreme of the scale of feel- 
 ing — supreme intensity of emotion. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 "Thou, too, hoar mount, with thy sky-pointing peaks, 
 Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard, 
 Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene, 
 Into the depth of clouds that veil thy breast — 
 Thou, too, again, stupendous mountain ! thou 
 That, as I raise my head, awhile bowed low 
 In adoration, upward from thy base, 
 Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears — 
 Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud, 
 To rise before me, rise, oh, ever rise ! " 
 
 Hymn: S. T. Coleridge. 
 
 Cymbeline. " disloyal thing, 
 
 That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st 
 A year's age on me !

 Imogen. (Monotone.) " I beseech you, sir, 
 Harm not yourself with your vexation. 
 I am senseless of your wrath ; a touch more rare 
 Subdues all pangs, all fears." 
 
 Cymbeline, Act I., sc. 1. 
 
 II. Starting from the key-note, the voice rises 
 slightly or is suspended, at every logical pause, unless 
 the word at that pause is of special value to the 
 thought. By this melody the thought is carried or 
 suspended until it reaches a conclusion at the end of 
 the sentence. That conclusion is marked by a fall 
 of the voice to the key-note. 
 
 "The soul which animates Nature is not less significantly pub- 
 lished in the figure, movement, and gesture of animated bodies, 
 than in its last vehicle of articulate speech." 
 
 Behavior: R. W. Emerson. 
 " All night the dreadless angel, unpursued 
 Through heaven's wide champaign, held his way, till morn, 
 Waked by the circling hours, with rosy hand 
 Unbarred the gates of light." 
 
 Paradise Lost : Milton. 
 
 III. Words or phrases used in direct and familiar 
 
 address are delivered with a short rising inflection. 
 
 " Why, when, I say — Nay, good, sweet Kate, be merry." 
 
 Taming of the Shrew, IV., 1. 
 
 IV. In formal address the falling inflection is used.

 V. If the address becomes impassioned appeal, the 
 voice rises through longer intervals of the scale. 
 
 Wolsey. "0 Cromwell, Cromwell ! 
 Had I but served my God with half the zeal 
 I served my king, He would not in mine age 
 Have left me naked to mine enemies." 
 
 Henry VIII. , III., 2. 
 
 VI. At the close of a series of addresses or appeals, 
 the last word or phrase, which often makes a climax, 
 may be read with a falling inflection. 
 
 Macbeth. " Seyton ! — I am sick at heart, 
 When I behold — Seyton, I say ! — This push 
 Will cheer me ever, or dis-ease me now. 
 I have lived long enough ; . . . 
 
 
 Seyton ! 
 
 Enter Seyton. 
 Seyton. What's your gracious pleasure ? " 
 
 Macbeth, V., 4. 
 
 VII. If the word of address follows a very important 
 word, the falling inflection may be used ; in other 
 words, an emphasis dominates all the secondary in- 
 flections of a sentence. 
 
 " A light on Marmion's visage spread, and fired his glazing eye. 
 With dying hand above his head, 
 He shook the fragment of his blade,

 Were the last words of Marmion."

 VIII. The melody of a definite question (one 
 which can be answered by "yes" or "no") is a 
 gradual rise of the voice from the beginning to the 
 end of the sentence. If the sentence is very long, 
 the voice should ascend from an interval below the 
 key-note, rise slightly through the first phrases, re- 
 main suspended during the middle, and rise again 
 gradually towards the end of the sentence. In this 
 way the effect of a continuous rise of voice is secured 
 without extending unnecessarily the limits of the 
 speaking scale. 
 
 " We [members of the British Parliament] were nothing but in- 
 struments. Do you, after this, wonder that you have no weight 
 and no respect in the Colonies ? After this, are you surprised that 
 Parliament is every day and everywhere losing (I feel it with sor- 
 row ; I utter it with reluctance) that reverential affection which so 
 endearing a name of authority ought ever to carry with it ; that 
 you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet ; and that this 
 House, the ground and pillar of freedom, is itself held up only by 
 the treacherous under-pinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary 
 power . American Taxation : Edmund Burke. 
 
 IX. In a series of definite questions, a climax may 
 be produced by reading the last question with a fall- 
 ing inflection. 
 
 Shylock. " Three thousand ducats : well. 
 Bassanio. Ay, sir, for three months.

 Bass. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

 know your answer ? » The Merchant of Venice ^ Lj 3. 
 


## p. 51 (#55) ##############################################

 X. The melody of an indefinite question is a 
 gradual fall of the voice from the beginning to the 
 end of the sentence. If the sentence is very long the 
 voice should descend, in the manner described in 
 the treatment of the rise of voice, in a long, definite 
 interrogative. 
 
 11 But first whom shall we send 
 In search of this new world ? Whom shall we find 
 Sufficient ? Who shall tempt, with wand' ring feet, 
 The dark unbottom'd infinite abyss, 
 And through the palpable obscure find out 
 His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight, 
 Upborne with indefatigable wings 
 Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive 
 The happy isle ? What strength, what art can then 
 Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe 
 Through the strict senteries and stations thick, 
 Of angels watching round ? " 
 
 Paradise Lost : Milton. 
 
 XI. A sentence exclamatory in form may be either 
 ejaculatory or interrogatory in spirit. A declarative 
 sentence may also be used as an exclamation or in- 
 terrogation. The melody must, of course, closely 
 follow the intention of the speaker. 
 
 XII. The usual melody of the declarative sentence 
 is marked by the return of the voice to the key-note. 
 
 " So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave 
 the sense, and caused the people to understand the law." 
 
 Nehemiah: Bible.

 XIII. In a series of sentences forming a paragraph 
 or stanza, the voice should not fall to the key-note 
 until the close of the last sentence. The preceding 
 sentences should be closed with a suspension, rise, or 
 partial fall of the voice, according to the connection 
 of thought between sentence and sentence. 
 
 "We should not bestow our faculties on a multitude of small 
 and unimportant affairs. This is to waste them without benefit to 
 ourselves or to mankind. We should employ them in the pursuit 
 of some great and good end." 
 
 " Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, 
 And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged 
 Among the bulrush beds, and clutch' d the sword, 
 And strongly wheel' d and threw it. The great brand 
 Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon, 
 And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch, 
 Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, 
 Seen where the moving isles of winter shock 
 By night, with noises of the Northern Sea. 
 So flash' d and fell the brand Excalibur." 
 
 Morte tf Arthur : Lord Tennyson. 
 
 Melody of Emphasis. — We come now to the consid- 
 eration of the more complex melody of emphasis, — 
 the rise and immediate fall of the voice. Emphasis 
 means, etymologically, " forcible expression." There 
 are many ways of producing " forcible expression," 
 but this peculiar speech-tune (a combination of the 
 rising and falling inflection) is the essential means of 
 emphasis. Its peculiar office is to discriminate the

 PITCH. 53 
 
 word or phrase marked by its cadence from all related 
 ideas, expressed or understood. Thus : " The animal 
 you see is a horse" That is, it is not a dog nor a 
 cow. " It is a bay horse ; " — it is not a black nor a 
 gray horse. It will be found that this melody under- 
 lies or accompanies every other means of emphasis. 
 Thus the sentence, " Come here ! " may be spoken 
 softly or with tremendous force, " Come here ! " 
 With the added force, an intensified form of the 
 melody of emphasis is used. The melodies of em- 
 phasis accompany also a change of key : — 
 
 "Come here!" 
 
 Changes in time and timbre also do not obliterate 
 the appropriate melodies of emphasis. 
 
 It will be seen from the preceding examples, 
 that, as the thought becomes intensified, the melody 
 of emphasis includes a longer interval of notes, 
 and that this interval is generally lengthened by a 
 rise in the scale. Thus 
 This law varies, however, 
 different languages or 
 lects. Thus, a distinguishing characteristic of the 
 Scotch dialect is found in the fact that the melody of 
 emphasis does not rise, but falls, from the key-note 
 to the culmination of the emphatic phrase. In Eng- 
 lish, the melody of emphasis begins at the logical

 pause preceding the emphatic phrase, rises gradually 
 to the accented syllable of the central word in the 
 phrase, and falls to the succeeding logical pause. 
 Thus: — 
 
 " I was ( as yet [ a stranger in England." 
 
 The melody of emphasis may include a single word 
 or a long phrase ; thus : — 
 
 " Arm ! Arm ! it is — it is the cannon's opening roar ! " 
 
 In studying the melodies of emphasis, two principles 
 should constantly be borne in mind : — 
 
 1. The distribution of emphasis. 
 
 2. The concentration of emphasis. 
 
 In distributing or placing emphasis in a sentence, 
 the reader must theoretically mark every important 
 word or phrase by the characteristic melody of the 
 voice. In practice, however, it will be found that 
 some of these melodies must be modified or omitted 
 for the sake of euphony ; hence the principles of con- 
 centration or economy of emphasis. 
 
 Distribution of Emphasis. — XIV. A new idea must 
 always be emphatic. 
 
 " To die, — to sleep, — 
 To sleep! perchance to dream! ay, there's the rub^ 
 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
 Must give us pause.' ' 
 
 Hamlet, III., 1.

 XV. If the same idea recurs throughout the pas- 
 sage, though in the same or in different words, it is 
 unnecessary to repeat the melodies of emphasis. 
 
 Bassanio. " Sweet Portia, 
 
 If you did know to whom I gave the ring, 
 
 If you did know for whom I gave the ring, 
 
 And would conceive for what I gave the ring, 
 
 And how unwillingly I left the ring. 
 
 When naught would be accepted but the ring, 
 
 You would abate the strength of your displeasure." 
 
 Merchant of Venice, V., 1. 
 
 XVI. If the words are repeated in order to inten- 
 sify the thought, the melodies of emphasis should be 
 correspondingly lengthened. 
 
 " Blow, blow, thou winter wind, 
 Thou art not so unkind 
 
 As man's ingratitude ; 
 Thy tooth is not so keen, 
 Because thou art not seen, 
 
 Although thy breath be rude." 
 
 As You Like It, II., 7. 
 
 XVII. If the words are repeated in order to 
 strengthen the thought by mere reiteration, the mel- 
 odies of emphasis should simply be repeated. 
 
 " And every word its ardor flung 
 From off its jubilant iron tongue 
 Was War! War! War!" 
 
 Thomas Buchanan Head. 
 
 XVIII. The rhetorical figure, simile, should always 
 be read with a marked melody of emphasis. At the

 close of such a strong emphasis, the voice sometimes 
 falls to the key-note at the succeeding logical pause. 
 
 " Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they 
 leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as 
 a strong people set in battle array." 
 
 Joel: Bible. 
 
 XIX. The intensive particles, such as though, even, 
 whether expressed or understood, are always fol- 
 lowed by a marked emphasis. 
 
 " Though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him." —Bible. 
 
 Concentration of Emphasis. — The following laws of 
 melody are to be used as modifiers of the preceding 
 principles, in order to promote the harmony of the 
 sentence by omitting superfluous melodies. 
 
 XX. In a long series of modifying words or 
 phrases, postpone the melody of emphasis to the last 
 member of the series. If, however, each member of 
 the series is equally valuable, the melodies of empha- 
 sis must follow the thought without regard to eu- 
 phony. 
 
 " The thing I want to see is not Redbook lists and Court 
 Calendars and Parliamentary Registers, but the Life of Man in 
 England : what men did, thought, suffered, enjoyed ; the form, 
 especially the spirit, of their terrestrial existence, its outward en- 
 vironment, its inward principle; how and what it was; whence it 
 proceeded, whither it was tending." 
 
 BoswelVs Life of Johnson : Thomas Carlyle.

 XXI. When the important word is followed by a 
 modifying phrase or clause, postpone the emphasis to 
 the most important word in the modifier. 
 
 " A violet by a mossy stone, 
 Half hidden from the eye; 
 Fair as a star, when only one

 " An American in an English house will soon adopt the opinion 
 that the English are the very kindest people on earth, and will re- 
 tain that idea as long, at least, as he remains on the inner side of

 while you keep beyond a certain limit, but attracts as forcibly if 
 you get within the magic line.

 Surrey. M The heads of all thy brother cardinals 
 (With thee, and all thy best parts, bound together)

 emphasis upon one member of each theoretically em- 
 phatic group of words. 
 
 " On parent's knees, a naked new-born child, 
 Weeping thou sat'st while all around thee smiled ; 
 So live, that, sinking in thy last long sleep,

 From the Persian: Sir William Jones. 
 
 Major and Minor Cadences in Emphasis. — In familiar, 
 unimpassioned speech the melodies of emphasis occur 
 in major intervals of moderate length. If the theme 
 becomes exalted or heroic, the intervals are generally

 lengthened. The following descriptions of English 
 and Italian scenery illustrate, respectively, the nar- 
 rower and the wider range of emphasis. 
 
 " On English ground 
 You understand the letter . . . ere the fall, 
 How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields 
 Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like ; 
 The hills are crumpled plains, — the plains, parterres, 
 The trees round, woolly, ready to be clipped ; 
 And if you seek for any wilderness 
 You find, at best, a park. 
 
 Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut woods 
 Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs 
 To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps 
 Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear 
 In leaping through the palpitating pines, 
 Like a white soul tossed out to eternity 
 With thrills of time upon it . . . Italy 
 Is one thing, England one." 
 
 Aurora Leigh: Mes. Browning. 
 
 When weakness, pathos, or melancholy is to be 
 expressed, the cadences of emphasis are shortened 
 and become minor, as in music. 
 
 " Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon, 
 How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair ? 
 How can ye chant, ye little birds, 
 
 And I sae weary, fu' o' care ?

 That wantons through the flowering thorn ; 
 Thou minds me o' departed joys, 
 Departed — never to return. ' '

FORCE. 59 
 
 IV. 
 
 FORCE. 
 
 Foece or power of tone depends upon the length 
 of the vibrations of the resonant medium. Physio- 
 logically, power of voice is produced by a liberal but 
 measured supply of breath, which, striking accu- 
 rately the vocal cords, produces a complete vibra- 
 tion of the air in the resonance chambers of the 
 voice. Other things being equal, the stronger the 
 current of breath, the louder the sound uttered. 
 
 A Scale of Force. — As we have adopted the musical 
 scale of eight notes as the basis of melody in speech, 
 let us construct a similar scale or measure of Force. 
 
 Imagine a gamut of eight degrees of force, includ- 
 ing the intermediate fractions of intervals. 
 
 At one extreme we 
 have soft force.which 
 
 gradually in creases 
 l oud. to medium, and final- 
 ly to loud force ; or, in musical terms, a crescendo 
 from pianissimo to fortissimo. The element of Force 
 is less subtle than that of Pitch in its influence upon 
 speech. It does not enter into the refinements of

 thought, but is broadly expressive of various degrees 
 of strength or weakness, either physical or spiritual. 
 Soft force is an index of physical weakness or 
 depression, and also of tender and suppressed emo- 
 tion. 
 
 " The lovely lady, Christabel, 
 Whom her father loves so well, 
 What makes her in the wood so late, 
 A furlong from the castle gate ? 
 She stole along, she nothing spoke, 
 
 The sighs she heard were soft and low. 
 And naught was green upon the oak 
 
 But moss and rarest mistletoe : 
 She kneels beneath the huge oak tree, 
 And in silence prayeth she." 
 
 Christabel: S. T. Coleridge. 
 
 Medium force is used in colloquial or didactic utter- 
 ance, and also in the expression of controlled emo- 
 tion. 
 
 " I grieve to say it, but our people, I think, have not generally 
 agreeable voices. The marrowy organisms, with skins that shed 
 water like the backs of ducks, with smooth surfaces neatly padded 
 beneath, and velvet linings to their singing-pipes, are not so com- 
 mon among us as that other pattern of humanity with angular out- 
 lines and plane surfaces . . . and voices at once thin and strenu- 
 ous — acidulous enough to produce effervescence with alkalies, and 
 stridulous enough to sing duets with the katydids." 
 
 0. W. Holmes. 
 
 Loud force expresses exuberance of power — in 
 pleasure or in passion.

 Cavalier Tunes, I. , 2 : Robert Browning. 
 
 It is evident that the force of a given passage or 
 characterization may be determined in outline by the 
 general style of the composition. The secondary 
 changes in force may be abrupt or gradual, accord- 
 ing to the movement of thought. The following 
 passage illustrates both gradual and abrupt transi- 
 tions in force. 
 
 11 Meanwhile, Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians 
 Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest, 
 Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush. 
 
 Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from 
 its scabbard, 
 
 Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage 
 
 Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiend-like fierceness upon it. 
 
 Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war- 
 whoop ; 
 
 And like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December, 
 
 Swift and sudden and keen, came a flight of feathery arrows. 
 
 Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the 
 lightning ; 
 
 Out of the lightning, thunder, and death unseen ran before it."

 Relative Value of the Terms Soft and Loud. — The 
 
 terms soft and loud are relative in value. In a large 
 room, soft force must strike the ear of the listeners as 
 soft, and loud force must seem loud. When many 
 persons are speaking at once (as in a drawing-room), 
 medium force which would be appropriate under or- 
 dinary circumstances must be lessened in order not 
 to interfere with the " general good." 
 
 Preliminary Exercises in Force. — (These exercises 
 should not be practised until the student has abso- 
 lute control of his breath in the production of vow- 
 els and consonants.) 
 
 1. Practise the scale of Force as follows : — 
 
 Count<j3^4 (breathe) 5-6-7-8 
 
 2. Reverse the exercise. 
 
 3. Chant Push, with force, from 1-4 (-^usH !) 
 
 Use other vowels and phrases in the same way. 
 
 4. Reverse the exercise : Pus?T> 
 
 5. Shout: Bun! Run!! RUN!!! using the ap- 
 propriate emphasis with the Force. 
 
 6. Read carefully the sentences given above as 
 illustrations of different degrees of Force. 
 
 Stress. — Stress, as used in Elocution, may be de-

 scribed as a mode of force. As pitch applied to the 
 succession of thought in a sentence becomes melody, 
 so force applied to syllables of a word becomes 
 stress. When the main pressure of force falls upon 
 the beginning of a syllable, it is called Radical (root) 
 Stress ; thus, Arm ! Hurry ! In words of more than 
 one syllable, Stress falls principally upon the accented 
 syllable. Indeed, it is by means of a slight Stress 
 that " accent " is produced. 
 
 When the pressure falls upon the middle of a 
 syllable it is called Median Stress ; as, Soothe, 
 Lullaby. 
 
 Stress placed upon the end of a syllable is called 
 Final or Terminal Stress ; as, Loathe, Defy. 
 
 Stress which is evenly distributed throughout 
 the syllable is called Thorough Stress ; as, Hurrah ! 
 Hurrah ! 
 
 Radical Stress corresponds to the musical term 
 staccato ; Median, to legato. Radical Stress conveys 
 impressions of activity, energy, — either mental or 
 physical. In common with the other varieties of 
 Stress, it may be used with every degree of force — 
 from the softest whisper to the loudest shout.

 " If it be true that there is hereafter to be neither a Russian pol- 
 icy, nor a Prussian policy, nor an Austrian policy, nor a French

 there will be, I trust in God, an American policy. If the author- 
 ity of all these governments be hereafter to be mixed and blended, 
 and to flow in one augmented current of prerogative over the face 
 of Europe, sweeping away all resistance in its course, it will yet 
 remain for us to secure our own happiness by the preservation of 
 our own principles; which I hope we shall have the manliness to 
 express on all proper occasions, and the spirit to defend in every 
 extremity."

 QUALITY. 
 
 The word quality is so vague a term that it is dif- 
 ficult to restrict it to a scientific use. The French 
 word, timbre (stamp), or the German compound, 
 hlang-farbe (tone-color), is more accurate. In 
 Physics, the stamp, color, or quality of tone is 
 produced by the peculiar form given to the waves 
 of sound. The vibrations originated in the violin 
 have one form, those in the flute another, and those 
 in the cornet still another. In the human voice the 
 resonance chambers of the larynx, pharynx, and head 
 are the principal factors of tone-quality. Thus an 
 individual, a family, and even a race, may be stamped 
 by heredity with a peculiar quality of voice. But, 
 as has been already said, the human voice is superior 
 to other instruments in that it is possible to modify, 
 at will, its original timbre. Since, then, the voice is 
 so easily susceptible of education, there is small 
 excuse for the transmission of a disagreeable family 
 voice.

 and consonants represent, in their original form, a

 scale of different tone-colors. But these different 
 colors can be given approximately to each one of the 
 vowels. According to Professor Bell's scale of 
 vowels and consonants, given above (pp. 33 and 35), 
 the " vowels ee, ah, and oo are the extremes of the 
 natural vowel scale : the closest lingual vowel is ee, 
 the closest labial oo, and the most open sound ah" 
 The vowels which intervene in the scale are approxi- 
 mate in form to these. Of the consonants, Professor 
 Bell says, that P, B, and M" have the most anterior 
 formation," thence the scale moves on to T, D, and iV, 
 reaching finally K, Gr, and Ng, " which have their 
 seat farthest within the mouth." The predominance 
 of any one of these three sets of vowel and consonant 
 shapes produces a definite tone-color or quality of 
 voice. The skilful use of this subtle element of 
 speech, Quality, is most apparent in the higher forms 
 of poetry, and in the best prose-writing. Indeed, 
 English prosody is largely a study of the harmony of 
 vowel and consonant colors in Alliteration, Rhyme, 
 and Blank Verse.

 11 We ministers cannot help noting with interest among the symp- 
 toms of our time the way in which the preacher himself is regarded. 
 . . . The preacher is no longer the manifest superior of other men 
 in wit and wisdom. . . . There are two great faults of the minis- 
 try which come, one of them from ignoring, the other from rebel- 
 ling against, this change in the attitude of the minister and the peo- 
 ple towards each other. The first is the perpetual assertion of the 
 minister's authority for the truth which he teaches. . . . And the 
 other fault is the constant desire to make people hear us who seem 
 determined to forget us. This is the fault of sensational preaching. 
 A large part of what is called sensational preaching is simply the 
 effort of a man who has no faith in his office or in the essential 
 power of truth to keep himself before people's eyes by some kind of 
 intellectual fantasticalness. ... It is more tempting to be clever 
 and unjust than to be serious and just. Every preacher has con- 
 stantly to make his choice which he will be. It does not belong to 
 men, like angels, to be ' ever bright and fair ' together. And the 
 anxious desire for glitter is one of the signs of the dislodgement of 
 the clerical position in our time."

 "Running through Beckley Park, clear from the chalk, a little 
 stream gave light and freshness to its pasturage. . . . The view 
 was sweet and pleasant to him, for all the babbling of the water 
 was of Rose ; and winding in and out, to east, to north, it wound 
 to embowered hopes in the lover's mind, to tender dreams ; and 
 often at dawn, when dressing, his restless heart embarked on it and 
 sailed into havens, the phantom joys of which colored his life for 
 him all the day. But most he loved to look across it when the light 
 fell, The palest solitary gleam along its course spoke to him rich 
 promise. The faint blue beam of a star chained all his longings, 
 charmed his sorrows to sleep. Rose, like a fairy, had breathed her 
 spirit here ; and it was a delight to the silly luxurious youth to lie 
 down and fix some image of a flower bending to the stream on his 
 brain, and in the cradle of fancies that grew round it, slide down 
 the tide of sleep."

 Hearken ! her children to-day- 
 Shout for the joy of her face." 
 An Ode for the Fourth of July, 1876 : James Kussell Lowell. 
 
 11 1 never shall forget the half day that I spent on Gorner Grat, 
 in Switzerland. ... It is a barren rock, with snow only here and 
 there in the cracks and crevices ; but oh ! what a vision opened 
 upon me as I cast my eyes around the horizon ! There stood some 
 fifteen of Europe's grandest mountains. Down from the sides of 
 these mountains flowed ten distinct glaciers beside. I swept the 
 horizon, and saw at one glance those glorious elevations, on whose 
 tops the sun kindled all the melodies and harmonies of light. I 
 was alone. I disdained company. I was a son of God, and I felt 
 eternity and God and glory. And life ! — its murmur was like the 
 murmur of the ocean when you hear the beating of the surf against 
 the shore twenty miles away. Life! — it was like the faintest 
 memory of a fading dream. And the influences that had subdued 
 me or warped me — in that royal hour of coronation I lifted them 
 up, and asked, in the light of the other sphere, what are ambition 
 and vanity and selfishness, and all other worldly passions ? Look- 
 ing down from that altitude, I gained anew a right measure of life. 
 I never have forgotten it, and I never shall forget it till that vision 
 lapses into the eternal one ! 
 
 " Thus, too, one may stand on a mount of vision, quite apart from 
 life and its seductive influences, and there fashion again and read- 
 just all his moral measurements."

 Variations of Tone-Colors in the Same Words. — As has 
 been already hinted, it is possible to make every 
 vowel approximately Brilliant, Mellow, or Orotund 
 in quality. By changing the qualities of voice 
 upon the same word or phrase, a great variety of

 meanings may be conveyed. The French monologue, 
 " Oh Monsieur ! " the German comedy, " Come Here ! " 
 the clown's "O Lord, Sir ! " (in "All's Well that 
 Ends Well ") are all based upon the possibility of vary- 
 ing the speech-colors and melodies of these phrases, 
 under changing dramatic situations. It is evident 
 that the vowel forms have greater elasticity than 
 those of the consonants. P is more inflexibly p 
 than ee, ee. Hence the vowels are a more impor- 
 tant element in tone-quality than are the consonants. 
 
 Quality is pre-eminently the sensuous element in 
 speech. Its province is the expression of beauty in 
 thought or feeling. Yet, in itself, it has something 
 of the range of ideas conveyed by Pitch and by Force. 
 The Brilliant tone-colors may become exponents of 
 clear thinking, the Mellow of refined sentiment, the 
 Orotund of robust energy of feeling. The ability to 
 blend or contrast these tone-colors constitutes one of 
 the most subtle and charming elements of speech. 
 
 Impure Qualities of Voice. — There are certain impure 
 qualities of voice — such as the Guttural and Nasal 
 qualities — which are produced by an imperfect action 
 of the organs of speech. These Qualities are some- 
 times used for dramatic purposes, but should be 
 avoided, rather than cultivated, by the average stu- 
 dent. The special student should make use of these 
 "depraved" Qualities of voice only under the careful 
 supervision of a teacher.

 Preliminary Exercises in Quality of Voice. — 1. Practise 
 the musical scale with the table of vowels from 
 ah — oo. Prolong the notes with full Orotund 
 Quality. 
 
 2. Add the vowels from ah — ee. Avoid any 
 change of Quality with the changes in Pitch. 
 
 3. Use all the vowels with Mellow, and finally 
 with Brilliant Quality. 
 
 4. Practise carefully the succession of tone-colors 
 from e — ah — oo, gradually varying the timbre ; give 
 this exercise with a steady, even exhalation of breath. 
 
 5. Repeat the exercises, substituting appropriate 
 words and phrases for sounds. Thus, sonorous, 
 robust, victorious, calm, large, prim, fan, mean, 
 green, etc. 
 
 In American speech the quality of voice is often 
 marred (1) by incomplete opening of the mouth ; 
 (2) by laxity of the soft palate producing exagger- 
 ated resonance in the nose ; (3) by catarrhal obstruc- 
 tion of the nose causing incomplete resonance in that 
 organ. 
 
 1. To correct the first defect, chant words, making 
 all the vowels large and sonorous. 
 
 2. For the second, practise the open vowels with 
 marked radical stress, up and down the scale. 
 
 3. For the third, practise the scale with the nasal 
 consonants M, JV, Ng. Occasionally exaggerate those 
 sounds in speech, for the sake of practice.

 TIME. 
 
 All sound which appeals agreeably to the ear is 
 subject to certain laws of time. Time, as applied to 
 speech, involves the consideration of : — 
 
 iRate of Utterance, 
 Rhythm, 
 Pause. 
 
 Rate of Utterance. — The rate of utterance, i.e., the 
 number of syllables spoken per second, is regulated 
 by the subject. Just as the theme of a musical com- 
 position moves the composer to write at the begin- 
 ning of his score, Adagio, Moderato, or Allegro, so the 
 subject of a poem or discourse fixes its rate of 
 utterance as Slow, Moderate, or Quick. For con- 
 venience, a scale of rate may be constructed thus : — 
 
 SLOW. ^- EPItJj f QtJlCK. 
 
 1 2 3—4—5-6-7-8 
 
 If the theme is meditative, serious, solemn, the 
 Time must be Slow.

 11 The most powerful movement of feeling with a liturgy is the 
 prayer which seeks for nothing special, but is a yearning to escape 
 from the limitations of our own weakness, and an invocation of 
 all good to enter and abide with us ; or else a self-oblivious lif ting- 
 up of gladness, a Gloria in Excelsis that such good exists ; both the 
 yearning and the exultation gathering their utmost force from the 
 sense of communion in a form which has expressed them both, 
 for long generations of struggling fellow-men. The Hebrew liturgy, 
 like others, has its transitions of litany, lyric, proclamation, dry 
 statement, and blessing, but this evening all were one for Deronda. 
 The chant of the Chazan's, or reader's, grand wide-ranging voice, 
 with its passage from monotony to sudden cries ; the outburst of 
 sweet boys' voices from the little choir; the devotional swaying of 
 men's bodies backward and forward; the very commonness of the 
 building and shabbiness of the scene, where a national faith 
 which had penetrated the thinking of half the world, and moulded 
 the splendid forms of that world's religion, was finding a remote 
 obscure echo — all were blent for him as one expression of a bind- 
 ing history, tragic and yet glorious. . . . The whole scene was 
 a coherent strain, its burden a passionate regret, which, if he had 
 known the liturgy for the Day of Keconciliation he might have 
 clad in its antithetic burden : * Happy the eye which saw all 
 these things ; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul. 
 Happy the eye that saw our temple and the joy of our congrega- 
 tion; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul. Happy the 
 eye that saw the fingers when tuning every kind of song ; but 
 verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul/ "

 " There is something extremely pleasant, and even touching, — 
 at least of very sweet, soft, and winning effect, — in this peculiarity

 life ; but women — be they of what earthly rank they may, however 
 gifted with intellect or genius, or endowed with awful beauty — 
 have always some little handiwork ready to fill the tiny gap of 
 every vacant moment." 
 
 The Marble Faun : Nathaniel Hawthorne. 
 
 u The paramount virtue of religion is, that it has lighted up 
 morality; that it has supplied the emotion and inspiration needful 
 for carrying the sage along the narrow way perfectly, for carrying 
 the ordinary man along it at all. Even the religions with most 
 dross in them have had something of this virtue; but the Christian 
 religion manifests it with unexampled splendor. ' Lead me, 
 Zeus and Destiny,' says the prayer of Epictetus, 'whithersoever 
 I am appointed to go, I will follow without wavering ; even though 
 I turn coward and shrink, I shall have to follow all the same.' 
 The fortitude of that is for the strong, for the few ; even for them 
 the spiritual atmosphere with which it surrounds them is bleak 
 and gray. But, ' Let thy loving spirit lead me forth into the land 
 of righteousness;' — 'The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting 
 light, and thy God thy glory; ' — * Unto you that fear my name, 
 shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings,' says 
 the Old Testament; 'Born, not of blood, nor of the will of the 
 flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God ; ' — ' Except a man be 
 born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God; ' — ' Whatsoever is 
 born of God, overcometh the world,' says the New."

 Rhythm. — Rhythm has been defined, in a broad 
 sense, as the "law of succession." In speech it is 
 simply a successson of accented syllables recurring at 
 regular intervals. This recurrence of beats may be 
 heard in many of the sounds of nature. Says Emer- 
 son: — 
 
 " For Nature beats in perfect time, 
 
 And rounds with rhythm her every rune, 
 
 Whether she work in land or sea, 
 
 Or hide underground her alchemy. 
 
 Thou canst not wave thy staff in air, 
 
 Or dip thy paddle in the lake, 
 
 But it carves the bow of beauty there, 
 
 And the ripples in rhymes the oar forsake." 
 
 Rhythm in Prose. — The regular recurrence of an 
 accented syllable may be heard in the best English 
 prose. It is even possible to trace approximately the 
 different measures of poetry in prose. 
 
 Thus the following passage suggests the rhythm of 
 Dactylic measure, an accented followed by two un- 
 accented syllables : — 
 
 " In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty 
 desk and made an orchestra of it. Away they all went, twenty

 couples at once ; hands half round and back again the other way ; 
 down the middle and up again ; round and round in various stages 
 of affectionate grouping ; old top couple always turning up in the 
 wrong place ; new top couple starting off again as soon as they 
 got there, all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help 
 them." — Charles Dickens. 
 
 The following quotation from Carlyle moves in 
 Iambic measure, an unaccented followed by an ac- 
 cented syllable : — 
 
 " Time itself, which is the outer veil of Eternity, invests, of its 
 own accord, with an authentic, felt ' infinitude,' whatsoever it has 
 once embraced in its mysterious folds. Consider all that lies in 
 that one word, Past! What a pathetic, sacred, in every sense 
 poetic, meaning is implied in it ; a meaning growing ever the clear- 
 er, the farther we recede in Time — the more of that same Past we 
 have to look through." 
 
 BosweWs Life of Johnson : Thomas Carlyle. 
 
 When the rhythms of prose recur too frequently or 
 monotonously, the ornament becomes an affectation. 
 
 Rhythm in Poetry. — In considering rhythm in poetry, 
 the speaker is concerned chiefly with the relation of 
 accent and pause in the different units of time. 
 These units are the foot, the line, the couplet, the 
 stanza. 
 
 After much controversy among scholars, it was at 
 last decided that the accent of English verse was 
 produced by stress of voice rather than by the quan- 
 tity of syllables, as in the ancient languages. With 
 the added stress is associated also a slight rise in key, 
 in the utterance of accented syllables, — and this

 without reference to the melody of emphasis. The 
 different arrangements of accent in the foot produce 
 the various metres of verse. These metres are by no 
 means arbitrary, but are the results of the sequences 
 of thought and emotion in the mind of the poet. It 
 
 is said that the Iambic measure (thus, !|— P — P — I 
 
 in music) with all its possible modifications by 
 multiplication of syllables, variations in accent, 
 and the use of pause, is typical of all English verse. 
 Examples may be cited from the earliest battle 
 songs, from dramatic poetry, as well as from the 
 latest sonnets of the language. 1 However plausible 
 it may seem to the speaker to adopt this musical 
 notation of English rhythms, it is desirable to bear 
 in mind the usual names given to the various 
 metres, and to associate with them the movement of 
 the lines. Any work on Rhetoric may be consulted 
 for examples of the different metres. 
 
 Pause. — There are three varieties of pause : — 
 
 ! Logical, 
 Rhythmical, 
 Dramatic. 
 
 The Logical Pause has been described under " Res- 
 piration," as an indicator of the slight breaks in the 
 thought of a sentence, occasioned by its grammatical 
 or rhetorical structure.

 The Rhythmical Pause marks the divisions of the 
 various time-groups, the foot, verse, couplet, stanza. 
 This pause may also include the so-called Caesural 
 Pause, which, in Anglo-Saxon and Early English 
 poetry, marked the middle of the line, or one of 
 its sections. At the end of each foot, the pause, 
 in continuous reading, is of the slightest possible 
 duration ; at the close of the line it is somewhat 
 longer, and at the end of a stanza it is still longer. 
 Of course these pauses should coincide, wherever 
 possible, with the logical pauses. This harmony of 
 music and thought characterizes the work of the 
 greatest poets. 
 
 The Rhythmical Pause, according to some proso- 
 dists, may also form, like the rest in music, a part of 
 the metrical foot. An illustration of this function 
 of the pause is given in the peculiar metre of Cole- 
 ridge's " Christabel." Thus : — 
 
 " ' Tis the mid | die of night | by the cas | tie clock | 
 And the owls | have awa | ken'd the crow | ing cock. | 
 1 Tu-whit! | 1 X | ^ Tu-whoo! | 1 X | 
 
 This rhythmical use of pause is also given by Sid- 
 ney Lanier in explanation of some of the puzzling 
 irregularities of Shakspere's versification. It is evi- 
 dent that in the quotation from " Christabel," the 
 rhythmical pauses which occur in the line coincide with 
 the dramatic pauses which the reader would make. 
 
 One of the best illustrations of the close connection

 between the poet's thought and expression may be 
 found in Shakspere's management of pauses. As he 
 gained greater freedom in the use of verse, he changed 
 the pause, which he first placed usually at the end of 
 the line, to the middle of the following line. With 
 this change of pause was also associated a modifica- 
 tion of the last foot of the verse. By the use of 
 monosyllabic "weak endings" with the " run-on" 
 line, the thought is carried on with more elasticity 
 and intensity into succeeding lines. Close compara- 
 tive study of these changes has enabled scholars to 
 fix approximately the chronology of the plays, by 
 means of the so-called verse-tests. As this treatment 
 of the pause is important to the reader, two examples 
 of Shaksperean rhythms are given : — 
 
 1. End-stopt lines. 
 
 " At Pentecost, 
 When all our pageants of delight were play'd, 
 Our youth got me to play the woman's part, 
 And I was trimmed in Madam Julia's gown, 
 Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments, 
 As if the garment had been made for me; 
 Therefore I know she is about my height." 
 
 The Two Gentlemen of Verona, IV., 4. 
 
 2. Run-on lines. 
 
 In the following passage from "The Tempest," 
 the rhythmical pause at the end of the line is almost 
 imperceptible, while the main logical pause occurs in 
 the middle of the line.

 Ferdinand. [To Miranda.'] 
 
 " Full many a lady 
 I have ey'd with best regard, and many a time 
 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage 
 Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues 
 Have I liked several women ; never any 
 With so full soul but some defect in her 
 Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd 
 And put it to the foil." 
 
 The Tempest, III., 1. 
 
 The Dramatic Pause. — The dramatic pause is a 
 silence occasioned by a marked interruption of the 
 thought. It indicates primarily the personal feeling 
 of the speaker. The dramatic pause may occur 
 between the syllables of words, in the middle of a 
 foot, or it may coincide with a rhythmical pause. 
 This dramatic silence is an opportunity for panto- 
 mimic expression, which should be a commentary 
 upon the spoken words. 
 
 " But you don't know music! Wherefore 
 Keep on casting pearls 
 To a — poet ? All I care for 
 Is — to tell him that a girPs 
 * Love ' comes aptly in when gruff 
 Grows his singing. (There, enough!) " 
 
 A Tale : Robert Browning. 
 
 Preliminary Exercises in Time. — As the sense of 
 rhythm is so universal, it is hardly necessary to 
 recommend the scanning of verse. Indeed, it is 
 often well to ignore the rhythm of verse, in order to 
 secure clear delivery of the thought. Every intelli-

 gent reader should, however, be familiar with the 
 different movements of English prosody. The actors 
 of modern comedy who occasionally attempt to read 
 blank verse, show their lack of training in rhyth- 
 mical utterance. On the other hand, clergymen who 
 are accustomed to the chanting of the liturgy and 
 the reading of hymns, often carry the measured 
 cadences into the prose of their own discourses. 
 
 1. For Slow, Medium, and Quick rate of utterance, 
 count 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, in the same given time, — 
 say thirty seconds. 
 
 2. Repeat appropriate phrases with the different 
 rates of utterance. Read the examples given. 
 
 3. Practise the different rhythms of prose and 
 poetry as given above. Add other examples.
