PREFA.CE. 
 
 This work is prepared for the purpose of raising 
 the standard of reading and speaking in the public 
 and private schools. 
 
 Elocution has been neglected more than any one 
 branch of education. It has also been misunderstood 
 as being a rare accomplishment that was not within 
 the reach of every person. It is natural to express 
 the thoughts and feelings by the voice. The theory 
 of elocution teaches the proper use of the voice, the 
 same as grammar teaches the proper arrangement 
 of words. God has given us the "plastic material," 
 with laws for its use. These laws should commence 
 in the school-room. Every pupil should understand 
 the ai-t of controlling his breath and vocal organs ; 
 but the majority of teachers neglect this important 
 branch of education, which is the cause of so many 
 defective voices. Habit becomes so fixed in this 
 defect that it constitutes second nature; "and close 
 analysis becomes necessary that we may draw the 
 line between our own nature and this accumulated 
 or borrowed nature." The writer of this work does 
 not claim any credit for anything of worth which it 
 may contain. It is compiled from all the popular 
 works on elocution, and arranged in a system to meet 
 the wants of schools. C. J).

TO TEAOHEES. 
 
 Before every reading exercise the class should 
 practice development of the chest, and control of the 
 breath ; also exercise on the elementaiy sounds. 
 Pupils should be required to deliver their words 
 properly in speaking as well as in reading. Insist 
 on every word being heard distinctly ; avoiding nasal 
 tones caused by not raising the soft palate. 
 
 Drill the class to read naturally, as if talking ; 
 discouraging affectation and mannerism of any kind. 
 For strength of voice, practice loud explosive ex- 
 ercises; for distinct enunciation, the whisper; for 
 smoothness, the median stress ; for flexibility, rapid 
 movement. Ask the following questions before the 
 selection is read : What is the style of this selection ? 
 Is it pathetic, animated, declamatory or humorous? 
 What tones and qualities of voice does it require? 
 Does it contain personations, etc.?

 Elocution is the science which teaches the proper 
 delivery of 'words. 
 
 ANALYSIS OF WORDS. 
 
 Words are a combination of vocal sounds. 
 
 Yocal sounds are represented by letters, and pro- 
 duced by the organs of speech. 
 
 The English language is represented by twenty- 
 six letters, each letter having one or more sounds. 
 
 The letters are divided into vowels and conso- 
 nants. The sounds are divided into vocals, sub- vo- 
 cals, and aspirates. 
 
 Yowels represent vocal sounds. Consonants rep- 
 resent sub- vocal sounds and aspirates. 
 
 Yocals are unobstructed sounds. Sub-vocals are 
 obstructed sounds, and aspirates are breath sounds. 
 
 Yocal sounds are simple and compound.

 LESSON II. 
 ANALYSIS OF VOICE. 
 
 The proper delivery of words depends on voice 
 and expression. 
 
 Yoice is produced by the vibration of the edges 
 of the glottis, caused by the breath passing over the 
 vocal cords, which are situated in the larynx, and 
 through the cavities of the mouth and nose. 
 
 Perfect control of the breath and vocal organs will 
 produce a clear, full, and resonant voice. 
 
 RULES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BREATH. 
 
 Exile I. Always inhale through the nostrils. 
 
 EuLE II. Take a deep inspiration, contracting 
 the abdominal muscles. 
 
 EuLE III. Keep the lungs well inflated while 
 reading or speaking. 
 
 MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
 CHEST. 
 
 Position, Fig. 1. Expand the chest and 
 the upper part of the body as if defying a 
 blow, and you have the active chest. 
 
 Eelax the muscles and let the chest fall 
 as if fatigued, and you have the passive 
 chest.

 LESSON III. 
 
 I.— CHEST EXPANSION. 
 
 Position — Elbows sharply 
 bent and close to the side, fore- 
 arm horizontal, fists clenched, ..::.v;;v;.-t;:,,.., 
 
 f".-".. A 
 
 palms upward. Take a deep ^S -.... 
 
 inspiration. Hold the breath. 
 
 1. Extend the arms for- 
 ward with force, relaxing the 
 muscles and opening the hands, 
 palms downward. 
 
 2. Bring the arms energet- ^^°- ^• 
 
 ically back to their former position, expanding the 
 chest as much as possible. 
 
 3. Expel the breath through the nostrils, take a 
 fresh inspiration, and repeat from first movement. 
 
 II.— SHOULDER MOVEMENTS. 
 
 Position — Arms falling easily at the side. Take 
 a full breath. 
 
 1. Bring the shoulders forward, contracting the 
 chest. 
 
 2. Throw the shoulders back and down, expand- 
 ing the chest. 
 
 3. Repeat these two movements with expiration 
 and inspiration of the breath.

 ni.— SHOULDER MOVEMENTS,— ARMS BENT. 
 
 Position — Clenched fists at the 
 side of the shoulders, palms for- 
 ward, fore- arms vertical. 
 
 1. Bring the open hands, palms 
 inward, so as to nearly touch each 
 other about three inches in front 
 of the chin. 
 
 2. Throw the fore-arms back to the side 
 last position, fists clenched, palms outward. 
 
 3. Kepeat with expiration and inspiration. 
 
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE LUNGS. 
 
 1. Bring the tips of the fingers 
 to the shoulders, inhaling the 
 breath through the nostrils at 
 the same time. 
 
 2. Strike downward and for- 
 ward, clenching the fists with 
 the palms front, and expelling 
 the breath through the nostrils 
 with the movement. In this 
 movement keep the body steady 
 
 Fig. 4. and let the expulsion be done 
 
 by the abdominal muscles and diaphragm.

 PERCUSSION OF THE CHEST. 
 
 Place the hands on 
 the chest with the 
 fore-fingers just below 
 the collar-bones ; fore- 
 arms horizontal. Take 
 a deep inspiration 
 through the nostrils 
 and hold the breath. 
 
 1. Strike on the chest rapid percussive blows 
 with the hand from the wrist. Count four. 
 
 2. Give out the breath through the nostrils, in- 
 haling deeply. Eepeat the first movement. 
 
 N. B.— The blows should be light at first. When 
 the practice is easy, they may be increased in force, 
 but always free from violence. 
 
 PERCUSSION WITH ARM MOVEMENTS. 
 
 Position — Let the hands fall 
 easily at the side ; take a full 
 breath. 
 
 1. Swing the arms from the 
 shoulder alternately, giving elas- 
 tic but not heavy blows upon 
 the chest, below the collar-bone. 
 Give two blows with each hand. 
 
 2. Exhale and inhale the 
 breath as in the preceding ex- 
 ercises.

 LESSON IV. 
 
 EXERCISES IN BREATHING. 
 
 1. Relax the muscles of the chest. Take a full 
 breath, expandmg the chest to its fullest capacity. 
 Exhale gradually. 
 
 2. Expand the sides while inhaling. Exhale 
 gradually. 
 
 3. Inhale, expanding the entire waist as if trying 
 to burst a belt. Expel the breath by contracting the 
 whole waist. 
 
 4. Inhale, directing the will to the muscles of the 
 back and expand them as much as possible. Expel, 
 drawing these muscles inward. 
 
 5. Breathe deeply, forcing the abdominal muscles 
 outward. Expel : the abdominal walls are drawn 
 inward and flattened. 
 
 6. " Inhale slowly, exercising the will upon all 
 parts of the body simultaneously. Exhale slowly. 
 This is an intense form of what should be the natural 
 habit of breathing." 
 
 N. B. — Inhale and exhale through the nostrils. 
 Commence gradually and discontinue if any sensa- 
 tion of dizziness is experienced. Persons not accus- 
 tomed to habits of full breathing will derive special 
 advantages from these exercises.

 akimbo, with fingers pressing on the abdominal mus- 
 cles in front and the thumbs on the dorsal muscles 
 each side of the spine, the chest fully expanded, the 
 shoulders held backward and downward. 
 
 Inhale slowly until the lungs are well expanded, 
 retain the breath a moment, exhale slowly ; repeat 
 six times in succession. 
 
 Inhale quickly; exhale through the mouth slowly 
 and quietly, as in natural breathing, retaining the 
 active chest. Eepeat six times. 
 
 Expand the lungs to their utmost capacity, ex- 
 pel slowly through the open mouth, gently sounding 
 the letter h; repeat six times. This exercise is called 
 effusive breathing. 
 
 Expand the lungs as before, expel with force as 
 in a whispered cough ; repeat six times. This exer- 
 cise is called expulsive breathing. 
 
 Expand the lungs as usual, expel suddenly with 
 great force as if whispering loudly " W^o" to a person 
 in the distance ; repeat six times. This is called ex- 
 plosive breathing. 
 
 N. E. — Avoid irritating the throat. Whenever 
 the exercise causes coughing, the effort is too violent. 
 
 LESSON YI. 
 
 ANALYSIS OF VOCAL ORGANS. 
 
 Voice is produced by the vibration of the edges 
 of the glottis^ caused by the breath passing through 
 the larynx and t*he cavities of the mouth and nose. 
 
 The glottis is the opening at the upper part of 
 the larynx. 
 
 The larynx is at the top of the windpipe, and is 
 the organ of voice. It is susceptible of a multitude 
 of changes, affecting the pitch, force, and quality of 
 the voice.

 The passage between the larynx and moath is 
 called the pharynx, and is susceptible of various de- 
 grees of expansion and contraction. 
 
 In front of the phaiynx is the mouth, which is 
 thrown open by the movement of the lower jaw, and 
 produces the full effect of a round, smooth, and 
 agreeable tone. 
 
 At the top of the pharynx, behind the soft palate, 
 is the entrance to the nasal passages. When the 
 soft palate is raised it prevents the breath from pass- 
 iijg into the nose, and when it is depressed the 
 breath flows through the nostrils as well as into the 
 mouth.

 TONES. 
 
 Tones are pure or impure. 
 
 Pure tone is that quality of voice in which all the 
 breath is converted into a clear, round, smooth, and 
 agreeable sound. It is free from nasal or impure 
 
 quality. 
 
 Impure tones are used in expressing malignant 
 feelings, passions, personations, and mimicry. 
 
 Pure tone is used more than any other quality of 
 voice, and should be cultivated. The most severe 
 and sustained exercise of the voice in pure tone, if 
 pitched in the right key, will strengthen and invig- 
 orate the lungs and throat and fortify the whole sys- 
 tem against the invasion of disease. 
 
 Commence with the sound of ah, as that is the 
 most open sound. 
 


## p. 21 (#27) ##############################################

LESSONS IN ELOCUTION. 21 
 
 If ah is produced in a deep, full tone, the palate 
 and the uvula will rise, while the tongue lies flat, 
 and the top of the windpipe descends as in Fig. 9. 
 
 If ah is produced in a nasal tone, the uvula will 
 fall and appear to touch the tongue, as in Fig. 8. 
 
 " To think a gape " will place the vocal organs 
 in position for pure tones.

 Active chest. — Inhale the breath so that the ab- 
 domen is drawn inward and flattened. Keep the 
 head erect but not stifl", and the chest and shoulders 
 firm and steady. The efl:brt is made by the working 
 of the muscles of the abdomen and the relaxation 
 and contraction of the diaphragm.*

 LESSON IX. 
 
 VOWELS AND CONSONANTS. 
 
 Correct pronunciation depends on giving the 
 proper sound to the vowels; and distinct pronuncia- 
 tion depends on giving the proper sound to the con- 
 sonants. 
 
 Practice the following words, giving the proper 
 sounds to the vowels and consonants. 
 
 Assume the proper position ; inhale through the 
 nostrils ; open the mouth as wide as possible ; raise 
 the palate ; the larynx and base of tongue depressed ; 
 the lower jaAV dropped ; commence each word softly, 
 advance to greater force and then soften down again 
 at the end.

 8. Sound each word in a powerful and distinct 
 whisper. 
 
 9. Pour them forth as if calling to a person afar 
 off. 
 
 10. Inhale through the nostrils, expanding the 
 lungs to the greatest capacity ; expel the breath by 
 counting 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.

 CONSONANTS ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE ACTION 
 OE THE ORGANS OF SPEECH. 
 
 LABIALS. 
 
 Labials or lip sounds are made chiefly with the 
 lips ; there is a firm compression of the lips to arrest 
 the escape of the breath ; then the lips are suddenly 
 separated, as follows : — 
 
 p as in pipe. I b as in bab. I m as in mum. 
 w '' woe. I V " vive. I f " fife. 
 
 DENTALS. 
 
 Dentals or teeth sounds are made by the tongue, , 
 pressing on the teeth or the gums, as follows : — 
 
 t as m tat. 
 th " the. 
 
 8 " sis. 
 
 d as in did. 
 zh " azure. 
 z " zuz.

 PALATALS. 
 
 Palate sounds are made by the tongue pressing 
 on the palate, as follows: — 
 k as in kirk. | g as in gay. | y as in ye. 
 
 NASALS. 
 
 Nasals sounds are made by the tongue pressing 
 against the gums above the upper front teeth, the 
 sound passing through the nose, and the lips open. 
 Ng is sounded by drawing back and elevating the 
 tongue against the veil of the palate so that the 
 sound becomes thoroughly nasal.

 LESSON XI. 
 
 ARTICULATION. 
 
 Articulation consists in giving every letter in a 
 syllable or word its due proportion of sound, and in 
 making a distinction between the syllables of which 
 words are composed, according to the standard of 
 pronunciation. 
 
 Pronounce each of the following words. Do not 
 fail to complete the sound of every consonant by 
 restoring the vocal organs to their normal state: — 
 
 1. Slowly, taking breath between each word. 
 
 2. Rapidly and energetically. 
 
 3. In whispers.

 RECREATIONS IN ARTICULATION. 
 
 A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two 
 little boot-blacks, one white and one black, were 
 standing at the corners doing nothing, when the 
 white boot-black agreed to black the black book- 
 black's boots. The black boot-black was of course 
 willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow boot-

 black, and the boot-black who had agreed to black 
 the black boot-black's boots went to work. 
 
 When the boot-black had blacked one of the black 
 boot-black's boots till it shone in a manner that 
 Avould make any boot-black proud, this boot-black 
 who had agreed to black the black boot-black's 
 boots refused to black the other boot of the black 
 boot-black until the black boot-black, who had con- 
 sented to have the white boot-black black his boots, 
 should add five cents to the amount the white boot- 
 black had made blacking other men's boots. This 
 the boot-black whose boot had been blacked refused 
 to do, saying it was good enough for a black boot- 
 black to have one boot blacked, and he didn't care 
 whether the boot that the white boot-black hadn't 
 blacked was blacked or not. 
 
 This made the boot-black who had blacked the 
 black boot-black's boot as angry as a boot-black 
 often gets, and he vented his black wrath by spitting 
 upon the blacked boot of the black boot-black. 
 This roused the latent passions of the black boot- 
 black, and he proceeded to boot the white boot-black 
 with the boot which the white boot-black had blacked. 
 A fight ensued, in which the white boot-black who 
 had refused to black the unblacked boot of the black 
 boot-black blacked the black boot-black's visionary 
 organ, and in which the black boot-black wore all 
 the blacking ofi:' his blacked boot in booting the 
 white boot-black.

 Short, Smithfield's sole surviving shoemaker. Shoes 
 sewed and soled superfinely." Simon's spry sedulous 
 spouse, Sally Short, sewed shirts, stitched sheets, and 
 stuifed sofas. Simon's six stout sturdy sons — Seth, 
 Samuel, Stephen, Saul, Shadrach, and Silas, sold 
 sundries. Sober Seth sold sugar, starch, spices ; 
 Simple Sam sold saddles, stirrujjs. screws; sagacious 
 Stephen sold silks, satins, sbawJs; skeptical Saul sold 
 silver salvers, silver spoons; selfish Shadrach sold 
 shoe strings, soaps, saws, skates; slack Silas sold 
 Sally Short's stuft^'d solas. 
 
 Some seven summers since, Simon's second son, 
 Samuel, saw Sophia Sophronia Sj^riggs somewhere. 
 Sweet, sensible, smart Sophia Sophronia Spriggs ! Sam 
 soon showed strange symptoms. Sam seldom stayed 
 at the store selling saddles, but sighed sorrowfully, 
 sought Sophia Sophronia's society, sang several sere- 
 nades slyl}'. Simon stormed, scolded severely, said 
 Sam seemed so silly, singing such shameful, senseless 
 
 " Strange Sam should slight such S2)lendid sum- 
 mer sales," said Simon. " Strutting spendthrift! shat- 
 ter-brained simpleton !" 
 
 '' Softly, softly, sire," said Sally; "Sam's smitten 
 — Sam's spied a sweetheart. 
 
 " Sentimental schoolboy! " snarled Simon; " Smit- 
 ten! Stop such stuff!" 
 
 Simon sent Sally's snuff-box spinning, seized 
 Sally's scissors, smashed Sally's spectacles, and scat- 
 tered several spools. " Sneaking scoundrel ! Sam's 
 shockhig silliness shall surcease ! " Scowling Simon 
 stopped speaking, starting swiftly shopward. Sally 
 sighed sadly. Summoning Sam she spoke sweet 
 sympathy.

 "Sam," said she, "sire seems singularly snappy: 
 so, son, stop strolling, stop smoking segars, and 
 spending specie superfluously ; stop sprucing so ; 
 stop singing serenades, — stop short : sell saddles, 
 son ; sell saddles sensibly ; see Sophia Sophronia 
 Spriggs soon; she's sprightly, she's staple, so solicit 
 and secure Sophia speedily, Sam." 
 
 "So soon? so soon?" said Sam, standing stock' 
 still. 
 
 "So soon! surely," said Sally, smiling, "specially 
 since sire shows such spirit." 
 
 So Sam, somewhat scared, sauntered slowly, shak- 
 ing stupendously. Sam soliloquizes: 
 
 " Sophia Sophronia Spriggs Short — Sophia Soph- 
 ronia Short, Samuel Short's spouse — sounds splendid! 
 Suppose she should say — she sha'n't!" 
 
 Soon Sam spied Sophia starching shirts and sing- 
 ing softly. Seeing Sam, she stopped starching and sa- 
 luted Sam smilingly. Sam stammered shockingly: 
 
 " Sp-sp-splendid summer season, Sophia." 
 
 " Somewhat sultry," suggested Sophia. 
 
 " Sar-sartin, Sophia," said Sam. (Silence seven- 
 teen seconds.) 
 
 "Selling saddles still, Sam?" 
 
 " Sar-sar-sartin," said Sam, starting suddenly. 
 " Season's somewhat soporific," said Sam, stealthily 
 staunching streaming sweat, shaking sensibly. 
 
 " Sartin," said Sophia, smiling significantly. "Sip 
 some sweet sherbet, Sam." (Silence sixty seconds.) 
 
 " Sire shot sixty sheldrakes, Saturday," said 
 Sophia. 
 
 "Sixty? sho!" said Sam. (Silence seventy-seven 
 seconds.)

 " See sister Susan's sunflowers," said Sophia, so- 
 ciably scattering such stiff silence. 
 
 Sophia's sprightly sauciness stimuated Sam 
 strangely : so Sam suddenly spoke sentimentally : 
 " Sophia, Susan's sunflowers seem saying, ' Samuel 
 Short and Sophia Sophronia Spriggs, stroll serenely 
 ^and seek some sequestered spot, some sylvan shade. 
 Some sparkling spring shall sing soul-soothing 
 strains ; sweet songsters shall silence secret sighing ; 
 super-angelic sylphs shall — '" 
 
 Sophia snickered; so Sam stopped. 
 
 '' Sophia," said Sam solemnly. 
 
 " Sam," said Sophia. 
 
 " Sophia, stop smiling. Sam Short's sincere. 
 Sam's seeking some sweet spouse, Sophia. Speak, 
 Sophia, speak! Such suspense speeds sorrow." 
 
 " Seek sire, Sam, seek sire." 
 
 So Sam sought sire Spriggs. Sire Spriggs said, 
 " Sartin." 
 
 Seven short sabbaths later saw Sophia Sophronia 
 Spriggs the smilling spouse of Simon Short's son 
 Samuel.

 Long a as in fare should not be given the van- 
 ishing element e, as in haven. It is frequently pro- 
 nounced with short a, although not sanctioned by 
 orthoepists. 
 
 When or occurs in an accented syllable, followed 
 by a vowel or by ?-, it has its regular short sound o. 
 
 Examples. — Orange, torrid, foreign, coral, cor- 
 ridor, coronet. 
 
 Some orthoepists make a distinction in the sounds 
 of ur^ as in urn^ er as in Ae?', ir as in first; also 
 ear as in Jieard, or as in work, our as in scou7-ge, 
 yr as in myrtle, ar as in liar, uer as in guerdon. 
 Smart says, " Even in the refined classes of society 
 in England, sur, dm% hurd, etc., are the current pro- 
 nunciation of sir, dirt, bird; and indeed, in all very 
 common words it would be somcAvhat affected to in- 
 sist on the delicate shade of difference." Avoid giv- 
 ing the sound of ii, as gu^rl for girl. 
 
 LESSON XV. 
 
 ARTICLES. 
 The article a is always given its long sound when 
 emphatic. When unemphatic it becomes obscure, ap- 
 proaching the short vowel u. 
 
 The article the, when emphatic, is pronounced with 
 e long. When unemphatic before a vowel, the e has 
 the sound of short i, and before a consonant the sound 
 of short It.

 ASPIRATE SOUNDS IN PLURALS. 
 
 The aspirate sound of th should be preserved in 
 the plurals, as truths^ youths, breaths, icithes. The vocal 
 sound th in the plurals, as baths, laths, paths^ moths, 
 oaths, mouths, wreaths. 
 
 In the adjective forms, as blithe, lithe, it is vocal ; 
 also, in the verb forms, bathe, clothe^ sheathe, wreathe, etc. 
 
 ' UNACCENTED VOWELS. 
 
 Webster says : " When an unaccented syllable 
 ends in a consonant, its vowel, if single, has in strict 
 theory, its regular short or shut sound, though ut- 
 tered somewhat more faintly, or with a less propor- 
 tionate force than in an accented syllable, as-sign', 
 co7^-duct', cori-flict', etc. In many words of this class, 
 however, the vowel is apt to suffer a change of its 
 distinctive quality, passing over into some sound of 
 easier utterance." 
 
 The sound of short ii being the easiest of utterance, 
 is often called the natural vowel. This sound is fre- 
 quently used by careless speakers thus: putdtuh for 
 potato, enumy for enemy, u-iiidiih for window, will 
 yilJi for will you, charidy for charity, etc. 
 
 The following general principles indicate the 
 tendencies of unaccented vowels. 
 
 Long a and long e tend toward short i. 
 
 Examples. — Sunday, village, before, society, etc.

 EXERCISES IN PRONUNCIATION. 
 
 "An Indian, attracted by the aroma of the cof- 
 fee and the broth arising from the bivouac, and mo- 
 ving down the path, met a bombastic brave who was 
 troubled with bronchitis. The Indian, being in dis- 
 habille, was treated with disdain by this blackguard, 
 who called him a dog and bade him with much ve- 
 hemence and contumely to leave his domain, or he 
 would demonstrate with his carbine the use of a cof- 
 fin and a cemetery. The Indian calmly surveyed 
 the dimensions of his European antagonist and op- 
 ponent, and, being sagacious and robust, and having 
 all the combativeness of a combatant, shot this ruffian 
 in the abdomen with an arrow. 
 
 " A young patriot with a black mustache, coming 
 from the museum, laughingly said, 'Bravo; you 
 should be nationally rewarded by receiving the right 
 of franchise ; for I witnessed the altercation, and the 
 evidence is irrefragable and indisputable that you 
 have removed a nauseous reptile.'"

 OROTUND VOICE 
 Is the s^mimetrical enlargement of 23ure voice, and 
 is produced by a corresponding expansion of all the 
 vocal organs. It is the grandest quality of the speak- 
 ing voice. It is a full, clear, strong, smooth and ring- 
 ing sound, rarely heard in ordinary speech except 
 by careful cultivation. Dr. Eush describes the fine 
 qualities of voice constituting the orotund in the 
 following words : — 
 
 It is used to express whatever is grand, vast, or 
 sublime. 
 
 By a fullness of voice is meant that grave or hol- 
 low volume which approaches to hoarseness. 
 
 By a freedom from nasal murmur and aspiration. 
 
 By a satisfactory loudness and audibility. 
 
 By a smoothness or freedom from all reedy or 
 guttural harshness.

LESSONS TN ELOCUTION. 39 
 
 Persons possessing the orotund voice appear to 
 be laboring under a slight degree of hoarseness. It is 
 more musical and flexible than the common voice, 
 and depends on cultivation and management. More 
 depends on cultivation than natural peculiarit}'. 
 
 RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN THE OROTUND VOICE. 
 
 1. Take a deep breath, contracting the muscles of 
 the abdomen. 
 
 2. Let the pharynx or back part of the mouth be 
 well expanded. 
 
 3. The tongue depressed. 
 
 4. The uvula raised. 
 
 5. The larynx depressed. 
 
 6. The breath or voice directed in a vertical stream, 
 with great boldness and firmness. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. It took Eome three hundred years to die; and 
 our death, if we perish^ will be as much more terrific 
 as our intelligence and free institutions have given 
 to us more bone and sinew and vitality. May God 
 hide me from the day Avhen the dying agonies of my 
 country shall begin! O, thou beloved land, bound 
 together by the ties of brotherhood and common 
 interest and perils, live forever — one and undivided. 
 
 2. O thou that rollest round as the shield of my 
 fathers! Whence are thy beams, O sun! thy ever- 
 lasting light? 
 
 3. Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in 
 power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in 
 pieces the enemy, and in the greatness of thine ex- 
 cellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up

 LESSON XYII. 
 
 QUALITY OF PURE AND OROTUND VOICE. 
 Quality of voice depends oil), pitch, force^ stress and 
 
 movement. 
 
 PITCH. 
 
 Pitch signifies the place in the musical scale on 
 which the element, syllable, or word is sounded, or 
 the pitch of the voice in reading or speaking. 
 
 The speaking voice, in good elocution, seldom 
 rises higher than a sixth above the lowest note of its 
 compass. 
 
 Pitch is produced by the elevation or depression 
 of the larnyx, and by the increased or diminished 
 size or capacity of the throat. Low or grave sounds 
 appear to come from the chest, caused by the depres- 
 sion of the larynx, and high or acute tones from 
 the head, caused by the elevation of the larynx. 
 
 Pitch is either very low, low, middle, high, or 
 very high. 
 
 Low pitch is adapted to solemn, sublime, and 
 grand passages. 
 
 Middle pitch is adapted to ordinary, unimpas- 
 sioned conversation. 
 
 High pitch is adapted to gay and joyous emo- 
 tions, also for triumph and exultation, or for the ex- 
 tremes of grief and alarm.

 FORCE. 
 
 Force relates to the loudness of the sound; the 
 degrees of which may be described as subdued, 
 moderate, energetic and vehement. 
 
 ]N'oTE. — An improper and unscientific exercise 
 of force often marks the delivery of public speakers, 
 and has a tendency, more than any other cause, to 
 injure the vocal organs, and often to ruin them for 
 life ; but proper discipline and culture develop their 
 power, and improve the general health. 
 
 STRESS. 
 Stress relates to the application of force to the 
 different parts of the word or sound. 
 Stress has three leading forms, viz, : — 
 
 1. Eadical. 
 
 2. Median. 
 
 3. Vanishing. 
 
 LESSOT^ XYIII. 
 
 RADICAL STRESS. 
 
 Eadical stress is the application of force to the 
 first part of the vocal soimd. It is sudden and quick. 
 "The breath is held for a moment and then sent out 
 suddenly with a clear, distinct, and cutting force." 
 
 It is used to express intense feeling and emotion. 
 
 " It is this which draws the cutting edge of 
 words across the ear, and startles even stupor into 
 attention ; this which lessens the fatigue of listening 
 and outvoices the stir and rustle of an assembly." 
 — Dr. Rush.

 •■The utter absence of radical stress bespeaks 
 timidity and indecision, confusion of thought, and 
 ieebleness of purpose. The right degree of this 
 function indicates the manly, self-possessed speaker."' 
 — Murdoch and Russell. 
 
 Sound each vocal quick and loud six times: — 
 a>> o> a> 00 > e> 
 
 Give the following examples, with proper spirit. 
 Bring out the emphatic words with intense force ; 
 keep the voice within range, not too high. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Rise! father, rise! 'tis Rome demands your help ! 
 
 2. Out with you ! — and he went out. 
 
 3. Hold! hold for your lives! 
 
 4. Forward the Light Brig^fZe ! 
 
 5. To arms! to arms! to arms! they cry. 
 
 6. Down^ soothless insulter ! 
 
 7. Go from my sight ! I hate and I despise thee ! 
 
 8. Rouse JQ Romans ! rouse jq slaves!

 LESSON XIX. 
 
 MEDIAN STRESS. 
 
 Median stress is the application of force to the 
 middle of the vocal sound. 
 
 Commence the sound in a very subdued tone ; 
 gradually increase until the sound is full and deep, 
 then gradually diminish in force to the close. 
 
 It is used to express pathos, solemnity, reverence, 
 sublimity, devotion, and grandeur. It should be 
 applied in different degrees, according to the sen- 
 timent. 
 
 Median stress is one of the greatest beauties in 
 reading, — although carried to excess, it becomes a 
 fault, — and should be judiciously used. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. a <> o <> a <> 00 <> e <> 
 
 2. Woe unto thee, Chorazin. Woe unto thee, Beth- 
 saida. 
 
 3. Then age and want, oh ill matched pair, 
 
 Show man was made to mourn. 
 
 4. Holl on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll. 
 
 5. Blow, bugle, bloiv; set the wild echoes fli/ing. 
 
 6. Oh the wild charge they made. 
 
 VANISHING STRESS. 
 
 Vanishing stress is the application of the voice to 
 the last part of the vocal sound. It commences 
 with a light and gentle sound, which gradually in- 
 creases in volume, and suddenly terminates with a 
 heavy and violent sound. It is one of the best exer- 
 
 J

 cises for strengthening the voice. It is used to ex- 
 press determined purpose, earnest resolve, stern re- 
 buke, astonishment, contempt, horror, revenge, and 
 hate. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. a < o < a < 0(3 < e < 
 
 2. I wont! I shall t! 
 
 3. ^houslavel thou wretch I thoM covmrd ! 
 
 4. Thou little valiant, great in villiany! 
 
 5. Thou ever strong upon the strongest side ; 
 
 6. Th.OM fortune' s champion! 
 
 7. / an liohmg palm? 
 
 8. You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, 
 
 9. Or by the gods this speech were else your last ! 
 
 10. I tell thee, thou art defied! 
 
 11. Hence! horrible shadow, hence! 
 
 12. I say you are not! 
 
 13. I hate him. 
 
 LESSON XX. 
 
 DERIVATIVE FORMS OF STRESS. 
 
 1. Thorough stress. 
 
 2. Compound stress. 
 
 3. Intermittent stress. 
 
 THOROUGH STRESS. 
 Thorough stress is the application of the force of 
 the voice to the whole extent of the vowel sound. 
 It is used in expressing joy, exultation, lofty com- 
 mand, indignation, and bravado.

 5. Rejoice, ye men of Algiers, ring your hells ! 
 King John, your king and England's, doth ap- 
 pear, 
 
 Open your gates and give the victor way ! 
 
 (This is a vigorous shouting exercise. The chest 
 must be expanded to its greatest capacity, the mouth 
 well opened, using the utmost force without violence. 
 It is invigorating and agreeable, and will give 
 strength to the lungs and volume to the voice.) 
 
 LESSON XXI. 
 COMPOUND STRESS. 
 Compound stress is the application of the force to 
 the first and last parts of the sound. It is the union 
 of the radical and vanishing stress on the same 
 sound, and is used to express surprise, contempt and 
 mockery, or sarcasm. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. a >< 6 >< a >< 00 >< c >< 
 
 2. Gone to be r)iarried! Gone to swear a peace ! 
 It is not so ; thou hast mis-spoke, mis-heard;

 It cannot he; thou dost but say 'tis bo. 
 
 3. Banished from Rome. 
 
 4. Smile on^ my lords: 
 
 / scorn to count what feelings, withered hopes, 
 Strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs, 
 I have within my heart's hot cells shut up 
 To leave you in your lazy dignities; 
 But here I stand and scoff jom. ; here I fling 
 Hatred and full defiance in your face. 
 
 INTERMITTENT STRESS. 
 
 Intermittent stress is a tremulous effort of the 
 voice ; the force is broken, it is used to express feeble 
 and broken utterance of age, sickness, and grief. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. a ---'-'-' 0--'-'-'- a-'---'-'- 00 '''-'-'"- e '-'-'--'-- 
 
 2. Pity the sorrows of a poor old man, 
 
 Whose ti^emhling limhs have borne him to your door. 
 
 3. He's sinking/ he's sinking/ 
 Oh, what shall I do? 
 
 LESSON XXII. 
 
 MOVEMENT. 
 
 Movement of voice is the rate at which we speak. 
 
 Words are uttered slowly, moderately, and rap- 
 idly, according to the nature of the sentiment to be 
 expressed. 
 
 Slow movement is used to express reverence, sub- 
 limity, amazement, awe and horror. 
 


## p. 48 (#54) ##############################################

48 LESSONS IN ELOCUTION. 
 
 Moderate movement is used in narrative, essays, 
 and newspaper articles. 
 
 Eapid movement is used to express joy, anger, or 
 excitement. 
 
 '^ Appropriate elocution accommodates the move- 
 ment of voice to every mood of thought, from the 
 slowest prolonged and lingering utterance of deep 
 contemplation and profound awe, to the swift and 
 rapid strains of lyric rapture and ecstasy. Utter- 
 ance to be natural and effective must have the gen- 
 uine expression of its appropriate movement. So- 
 lemnity cannot exist to the ear without slowness — 
 gayety without briskness of utterance, gravity with- 
 out sedate style, nor imagination without a lively 
 movement." 
 
 The three principal faults in movement are, uni- 
 form slowness or drawling, uniform rapidity, or uni- 
 form moderate movement. 
 
 '' Perfect command of every degree of move- 
 ment is indispensable to the appropriate expression 
 of the different forms of thought and emotion." 
 
 QUANTITY. . 
 
 Quantity is time upon words. It is prolonged 
 or shortened according to the nature of the meaning 
 of the word. The word long should receive more 
 time than short, though the latter contains more 
 letters. 
 
 Words of dignity require long quantity. 
 
 Words of impatience or sudden action require 
 short quantity.

 LESSON XXIII. 
 
 INFLECTIONS. 
 1 11 flections fire slides of the voice used in reading 
 oi- speaking, to give better expression ; also to give 
 emphasis. 
 
 Inflections are rising and falling : both are united 
 in the circumjiex. 
 
 RISING INFLECTION. 
 Eising inflection denotes uncertainty, interroga- 
 tion, and incompleteness of idea. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Are you going home? 
 
 2. Shall I know your answer? 
 
 3. Hast thou ever known the feeling I have felt, 
 
 when I have seen, 
 Mid the tombs of aged heroes, 
 Memories of what hath been — 
 What it is to view the present 
 In the light of by-gone days; 
 From an eminence to ponder 
 Human histories and ways? 
 
 4. Was it the chime of a tiny bell, 
 
 That came so sweet to my dreaming ear. 
 Like the silvery tones of a fairy's shell, 
 
 That he winds on the beach so mellow and 
 clear, 
 When the winds and the waves lie together 
 
 asleep, 
 And the moon and the fairy are watching the 
 deep,

 She dispensing her silvery light, 
 And he his notes so silvery quite, 
 
 While the boatman listens and ships his oar, 
 To catch the music that comes from the 
 shore? 
 
 FALLING INFLECTION. 
 
 Falling inflection denotes positiveness, confidence, 
 and determination or completion of idea. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish 
 son is the heaviness of his mother. 
 
 2. Shakspeare was the greatest tragic writer. 
 
 3. The war must go on. 
 
 4. It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing 
 of God, it shall be my dying sentiment, independ- 
 ence now, and independence forever. 
 
 5. Art is never art till it is more than art. The 
 finite exists only as to the body of the infinite. 
 The man of genius must first know the infinite, 
 unless he wishes to become, not a poet, but a maker 
 of idols. 
 
 EXAMPLES IN RISING AND FALLING INFLECTION. 
 
 Tonch. — How old are you? 
 Will. — Five and twenty, sir. 
 Tonch. — A ripe age. Is thy name William? 
 Will. — William, sir. 
 
 Tonch. — A fair name. Wast born i' the forest, 
 here? 
 
 Will. — Ay, sir, I thank God. 
 
 Tonch, — Thank God? a good answer. Art rich?

 Will. — Faith, sir, so-so. 
 
 Tonch. — So-so is good, very good; — very excellent 
 good: and yet, it is not; it is but so-so. 
 
 CIRCUMFLEX. 
 
 The circnmflex is a combination of the rising and 
 falling inflection on the same syllable or word. 
 
 The falling circumflex terminates on the down- 
 ward slide. 
 
 The rising circumflex terminates on the upward 
 slide. 
 
 The circumflex inflections express irony, sarcasm, 
 doubt, Tnockery, rej^roach, and wonder. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. It is vastly easier for you, Mistress Dial, who 
 have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up 
 above me — it is vastly easier for you, I say, to ac 
 cuse other people of laziness. 
 
 2. My father's trade! now really that's too bad. 
 My father's trade ! why, blockhead, are you mad? 
 My father, sir, did never stoop so low — 
 
 He was a gentleman, I'd have you know. 
 
 3. The common error is, to resolve to act right 
 after breakfast, or after dinner, or to-morrow morn- 
 ing, or next time, but now, just now, this once, we 
 must go on the same as ever. 
 
 4. Now, in building of chaises, I tell you what, 
 There is always somewhere a weakest spot ; 
 And that's the reason, beyond a doubt, 
 
 A chaise breaks down, but doesn't wear out.

 LESSON XXIY. 
 
 PAUSES. 
 
 There are two kinds of pauses in reading, — Grain- 
 matical and Rhetorical. 
 
 The grammatical pause is indicated by the marks 
 of punctuation, as follows: The comma (,), semi- 
 colon (;), colon (:), and period (.); also interrogation 
 (?), exclamation (!), dash ( — ), parenthesis (), and 
 quotation marks (" "). These are pauses which di- 
 vide composition into sentences, and sentences into 
 sections. 
 
 These pauses are of great importance, as a disre- 
 gard of them in reading will very frequently de- 
 stroy the sense completely or change the meaning 
 from what it should be. 
 
 Rhetorical pause depends on the construction of 
 the sentence, and is one of the chief means of dis- 
 tinctness in the expression of thought. It consists 
 in suspending the voice before or after the utterance 
 of an important thought. The pause before the jmn- 
 cijKil ivord excites curiosity and expectation ; the 
 pause after the principal word carries the mind back 
 to what has been said. " It should not be repeated 
 too frequently; for as it excites strong emotions, and 
 of course raises expectations ; if the importance of the 
 matter be not fully answerable to such expectations 
 it occasions disappointment and disgust." Sense and 
 sentiment are the best guides in the use of the pause. 
 
 PARENTHESIS. 
 " A sentence or certain words inserted in a sen- 
 tence, which interrupts the sense or natural connec- 
 


## p. 53 (#59) ##############################################

LESSONS TN ELOCUTION. 53 
 
 tion of words, but serves to explain or quality the 
 sense of the principal sentence." 
 
 Parenthesis should be read more ra])idly and in a 
 more subdued tone, making a short pause before 
 commencing, and resuming the former pitch and 
 tone at the principal sentence. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Know then this truth, (enough for man to 
 
 know,) 
 Virtue alone is happiness below. 
 
 2. Oh, woman ! though only a part of man's rib, 
 (If the story in Genesis don't tell a fib,) 
 Should your naughty companion e'er quarre^ 
 
 with you 
 You are certain to prove the best man of the 
 two. 
 
 3. I have seen charity (if charity it may be 
 called,) insult with an air of pity. 
 
 4. Know ye not, brethren (for I speak unto them 
 that know the law), that the law hath dominion over 
 a man as long as he liveth ? 
 
 5. I am happy, said he (expressing himself with 
 the warmest emotion), infinitely happy in seeing you 
 return. 
 
 LESSON XXV. 
 
 EMPHASIS. 
 
 Emphasis gives prominence to certain words and 
 phrases, and maybe expressed by an increase of force 
 or stress. 
 
 " Emphasis is in speech, what coloring is in paint-

 ing. It admits of all degrees, and must, to indicate 
 a particular degree of distinction, be more or less 
 intense, according to the ground word or current 
 melody of the discourse." 
 
 " No certain rules can be given to guide the stu- 
 dent in the employment of emphasis. If the voice 
 be clear, full, flexible, and under the control of the 
 will, he will be able to express what he fully under- 
 stands and strongly feels in an effective manner, 
 without the aid of rules. The best advice to the 
 student upon this point is to study his subject until 
 he thoroughly understands it, and then practice upon 
 until he can express it to his own satisfaction." 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 "In Homer, we discern all Greek vivacity ; in Virgil 
 all the Eoman stateliness. Homer's imagination is by 
 much the most rich and copious) Virgil's the most 
 chaste and correct. The strength of the former lies in 
 his power of loarming the fancy] that of the latter in 
 his power of touching the heart. Homer's style is 
 more simple and animated] Virgil's more elegant and 
 uniform. ^\l\ie first has on many occasions a sublimity 
 to which the latter never attains; but the latter in re- 
 turn never sinks below a certain degree of epic dignity 
 which cannot so clearly be pronounced of the former." 
 
 Cadence is the easy, natural falling of the voice at 
 the end of a sentence, which indicates that the sense 
 is complete. 
 
 JSTo rules can be given by which to regulate the 
 tone and movement of the voice in makino- the ca-

 judgment.

 LESSON XXYI. 
 
 IMPURE TONES. 
 Impure tones are aspirate, guttural and fahetto. 
 
 ASPIRATE. 
 Aspirate is the intense whisper with little or no 
 vocality. It is used to express fear, secrec}', horror 
 and aversion. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Hark ! what was that? Hark ! hark ! to the 
 shout. 
 
 2. Hark ! I hear the bugles of the enemy ! They 
 are on the march along the bank of the river! We 
 must retreat instantly or be cut off from our boats ! 
 I see the head of their column already rising over 
 the height! Our only safety is in the screen of the 
 hedge. Keep close to it — be silent — and stoop as 
 you run! For the boats! Forward. 
 
 3. Soldiers! You are now within a few steps of the 
 enemy's outposts! Our scouts report them as slum- 
 bering in parties around their watch-fires, and ut- 
 terly unprepared for our approach. A swift and 
 noiseless advance around that projecting rock, and 
 we are upon them, — we capture them without the 
 possibility of resistance ! One disorderly noise or 
 motion may leave us at the mercy of their advanced 
 guard. Let every man keep the strictest silence un- 
 der pain of instant death. 
 
 GUTTURAL. 
 Guttural is a harsh throat tone. The sound is sent 
 forth in a rough, discordant tone. It expresses hat- 
 red, intense anger, loathing and contempt. 
 


## p. 57 (#63) ##############################################

LESSONS IN ELOCUTION. 57 
 
 The prominent characteristic of this tone is its 
 harsh, discordant quality, produced by the compressed 
 and partial closing of the throat above the glottis. It 
 denotes all those states of mind classed under dislike 
 and ill-humor. When carefully controlled, it is an 
 element of great power, but the greatest care should 
 be taken to use it in the right sentiment. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. I loathe ye in my bosom, 
 
 I scorn ye with my eye, 
 And I'll taunt ye with ni}^ latest breath. 
 And fight ye till I die. 
 
 2. Avaunt! and quit my sight. Let the earth 
 
 hide thee. 
 Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold, 
 Thou hast no speculation in those eyes, 
 Which thou dost glare with, 
 
 3. Hence horrible shadow. 
 Unreal mockery, hence ! 
 
 4. I'll have my bond ; I idUI not hear thee speak. 
 ril have my bond ; and therefore si^eah no more. 
 I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool. 
 
 To shake the head, relent, and sigh; and yield 
 
 To Christian intercessors. Follow not; 
 
 I'll have no more speaking, 7 loill have my bond. 
 
 FALSETTO. 
 
 ^' Falsetto voice is generally produced above the 
 natural tone, and is used in imitation of high female 
 voices, in the voices of children, and in affectation, 
 etc."

 I hate to hear every thing vulgarly my'd. 
 Now whenever you speak of your chattels

 Say ottr cow-house, our barn-yard, our pig-pen." 
 " By your leave, Mrs. Snooks, I say what I 
 please. 
 Of my houses, iny lands, my gardens, m?/ trees." 
 " Say our,'' Xantippe exclaimed in a rage; 
 "I won't, Mrs. Snooks, though you ask it an 
 age." 
 
 2. Will the ISTew Year come to-night, mamma, I'm

 I run to peep within the door by morning's early 
 
 light, 
 'Tis empty still — Oh, say, mamma, will the New 
 
 Year come to-night. 
 
 3. "Yes, it is worth talking of! But that's how 
 you always try to put me down. You fly into a rage? 
 and then, if I only try to speak, you won't hear me. 
 That's how you men always will have all the talk to 
 yourselves! A poor woman isn't allowed to get a 
 word in." 
 
 LESSON XYIl. 
 
 POSITION. 
 The position in speaking or reading should be 
 natural, easy and graceful. 
 
 The book should be held in the left hand. The 
 
 i

 eyes should not be fixed on the book, but as the 
 reader takes in as many words as he can remember 
 at a glance, he should look and read to the audience 
 or teacher. 
 
 COUNTENANCE. 
 
 If the speaker or reader has an intelligent knowl- 
 edge of his subject, his countenance will assume the 
 proper expression. 
 
 GESTURE. 
 
 The arm should be free and unconstrained in ges- 
 tures, the movement should be from the shoulder 
 rather than the elbow. Elbow slightly curved. 
 
 The hands in gesture should be used easily and 
 gracefully. 
 
 The hands may be sv/pine, prone, ve^^tical, p)ointing, 
 and clenched. 
 
 The su2nne hand lies open with the palm upward. 
 
 The prone hand is opened with the palm down- 
 ward. 
 
 The vertical hand is opened with the palm out- 
 ward from the speaker. 
 
 The 2yointing hand, forefinger extended, is used in 
 designating or pointing out a particular object. 
 
 The clenched hand denotes intense action of the 
 will or passions. 
 
 Hand and arm gestm^es are made in four general 
 directions — -front, oblique, lateral, and backward. Each 
 is divided into horizontal, descending and ascending. 
 
 Front gestures are used to illustrate that which is 
 near to us. 
 
 Oblique gestures are more general in their applica- 
 tion, relating to things indefinitely.

 Lateral gestures denote expansion, extreme dis- 
 tance, etc. 
 
 Backward gestures denote tilings remote, obscure, 
 or hidden. 
 
 Horizontal gestures are used in general allusions, 
 indicating equality. 
 
 Descending gestures denote inferiority or inequal- 
 ity, also expresses determination and purpose. 
 
 Ascending gestures denote superiority, greatness, 
 and lofty ideas. 
 
 DIRECTIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS. 
 
 The dotted words indicate where the hand is to 
 be raised in preparation. 
 
 The gesture is made upon the words in capitals. 
 
 The hand drops upon the italicized word or sylla- 
 ble following the word in capitals. If italicized 
 words precede the word in capitals, it indicates that 
 the hand is to follow the line of gesture.

 LESSON XXIX. 
 EXPRESSION. 
 
 ExiwGssion is the art of adapting the voice, coun- 
 tenance, and gestures to the nature of the sentiment. 
 
 "As it is impossible to print a tear, a groan, a 
 sneer, a laugh, or a look, so it is impossible to express 
 all the meaning of an author unless, in the spirit of 
 the sentiment, and from long practice, one is able to 
 express that sentiment. The mere repetition of the 
 words of Shakspeare would give little idea of the full 
 meaning and power of those words. In this view, 
 manner is quite as important as matter, for without it 
 the choicest ideas, as represented by words, are life- 
 less." Hence, expression in elocution is the appro- 
 priate and harmonious application of all the princi- 
 ples of voice culture. 
 
 Quality, Pitch, Force, Stress, Movement, Empha- 
 sis, Inflection, Pause, and Personation, are essential 
 requirements to give expression and educate the 
 taste and judgment. 
 
 Special attention should be given to the change 
 of voice in Personation, as it is of the greatest im- 
 portance in public reading and declamation. 
 
 The best guide for expression is to realize and 
 


## p. 65 (#71) ##############################################

LESSONS IN ELOCUTION. 65 
 
 understand the passage to be read, and then give the 
 a))propriate tones, which will require an intelligent 
 analysis of the subject. 
 
 We may, by the use of Pitch, Force, Stress, 
 Movement, Emphasis, Inflection, Pause, and Persona- 
 tion, give different meaning to our words or sentences, 
 according to the application. 
 
 Eead the sentence, " Many men are misled by 
 fame," without emphasis, middle ;;i7cA. Emphasize 
 one of the words and the sense will be different, as 
 follows: — 
 
 1. Many men are misled by fame. 
 
 2. Many men are misled by fame. 
 
 3. Many men are misled by fame. 
 1. Many men are misled \)j fame. 
 
 5. Many men are misled by fame. (Low and soft.) 
 
 6. Many men are misled by fame. (Whisper.) 
 
 7. Many men are misled by fame. (Tre7nor.) 
 
 " A good reader or speaker ought not only to be 
 able to sound every word correctly, but should know 
 always the exact meaning of what he reads, and feel 
 the sentiment he utters, and also to know how to 
 give the intended meaning and emotion when he 
 knows them." 
 
 LESSON XXX. 
 TRANSITION. 
 
 Transition in elocution is the power of giving 
 proper variety to reading. Without it, reading is mo- 
 notonous. There must be harmony between the 
 voice and the sentiment. If the subject of descrip- 
 


## p. 66 (#72) ##############################################

66 LESSONS IN ELOCUTION. 
 
 tion or the sentiment bo one of calmness and gentle- 
 ness, the voice must be soft and gentle. If it be 
 noisy or contentious, it becomes high and powerful. 
 " Transition also refers to the changes in style, as 
 from persuasive to declamatory; also to the expres- 
 sion of passion or emotion, as from grief to joy, fear 
 to courage, hope to despair." 
 
 EXAMPLES, ADAPTED FROM MONROE's MANUAL. 
 1. 
 
 Soft. Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows, 
 
 And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows ; 
 
 Loud. But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, 
 
 The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar. 
 
 2. 
 
 Slow. When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, 
 The line, too, labors : and the words move slow ; 
 
 Quick. Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain. 
 
 Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main. 
 
 3. 
 
 Aspirated. Hush ! hark ! did stealing steps go by ? 
 
 Came not faint whispers near ? 
 PuBB TONE. Nol — The wild wind hath many a sigh 
 
 Amid the foliage sere. 
 
 4. 
 
 Pure tone. A thousand hearts beat happily ; and when 
 Music arose with its voluptuous swell. 
 Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again. 
 And all went merry as a marriage-bell ; — 
 
 Aspirated. But hush ! hark ! a deep sound strikes like a rising 
 knell ! 
 
 5. 
 Orotund. Her giant form 
 
 O'er wrathful surge, through blackening storm, 
 Majestically calm, would go, 
 'Mid the deep darkness, white as snow !

 Pure tone. But gentler now the email waves glide 
 
 Like playful lambs o'er a mountain side, 
 
 Orotund. So stately her bearing, so proud her array. 
 The main she will traverse forever and aye. 
 Many ports will exult at the gleam of her mast ! 
 
 Aspirated. Hush ! hush ! thou vain dreamer ! this hour is her last. 
 
 Gradually How soft the music of those village bells, 
 
 SOFTER. Falling at intervals upon the ear 
 
 In cadence sweet ! now dying all away, 
 Gradu.ally Now pealing loud again, and louder still, 
 
 LOLT)ER. Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on. 
 
 7. 
 Middle pitch. From that chamber clothed in white, 
 
 The bride came forth on her wedding night ; 
 Low PITCH. There, in the silent room below, 
 
 The dead lay in his shroud of snow. 
 
 8. 
 Loud. Rise ! rise ! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight ! 
 
 Subdued. 'Tis finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors, 
 Culloden is lost, and my country deplores. 
 
 Loud. The double, double, double beat 
 Of the thundering drum, 
 Cries, Hark ! the foes come : 
 Charge, charge I 'tis too late to retreat. 
 
 Soft. The soft complaining flute. 
 In dying notes discovers 
 The woes of hapless lovers ; 
 Whose dirge is whispered by the warbling lute. 
 
 10. 
 Loud. The combat deepens. On, ye brave, 
 Who rush to glory, or the grave ! 
 Wave, Munich ! all thy banners wave, 
 And charge with all thy chivalry !

 Soft. Ah 1 few shall part where many meet ! 
 The snow shall be their winding-sheet, 
 And every turf beneath their feet 
 Shall be a soldier's sepulchre. 
 
 11. 
 Loud. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more. 
 
 Or close the wall up with ou]^ English dead ! 
 Moderate. In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man, 
 
 As modest stillness and humility ; 
 Loud. But when the blast of war blows in our ears, 
 
 Then imitate the action of the tiger; 
 
 Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood. 
 
 Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage. 
 Very loud. On^ on, you noblest English, 
 
 Whose blood is fetched from fathers of war-proof ! 
 
 Fathers, that, like so many Alexanders, 
 
 Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought. 
 
 And sheathed their swords for lack of argument. 
 Quick and I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, 
 
 Straining upon the start. The game 's afoot; 
 
 Follow your spirits, and, upon this charge, 
 VERT LOUD. Cry, — Heaven for Harry ! England ! and St. 
 George ! 
 
 12. 
 Aspirated. Hark ! below the gates unbarring ! 
 
 Tramp of men and quick commands ! 
 Pure tone. "'Tis my lord come back from hunting." 
 
 And the Duchess claps her hands. 
 
 Soft. Slow and tired, came the hunters; 
 
 Stopped in darkness in the court. 
 Loud. "Ho, this way, ye laggard hunters! 
 
 To the hall ! What sport, what sport? " 
 
 Slow and Slow they entered with their Master; 
 
 SOFT. In the hall they laid him down. 
 
 Slightly On his coat were leaves and blood-stains, 
 aspirated. On his brow an angry frown.

 13. 
 Gkaduallt Ever, as they bore, more loud, 
 
 LOUDER. And louder rang the pibroch proud. 
 
 Gradually At first the sound, by distance tame, 
 
 SOFTER. Mellowed, along the waters came ; 
 
 And lingering long by cape and bay, 
 Wailed every harsher note away; 
 Loud. When bursting bolder on the ear. 
 
 The clan's shrill gathering they could hear,- 
 Those thrilling sounds, that call the might 
 Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight. 
 
 14. 
 Soft oro- Father of earth and heaven ! I call thy name ! 
 tund. Round me the smoke and shout of battle roll ; 
 
 ' My eyes are dazzled by the rustling flame; — 
 Father, sustain an untried soldier's soul. 
 Or life, or death, whatever be the goal 
 That crowns or closes round the struggling hour, 
 
 Thou knowest, if ever from my spirit stole 
 One deeper prayer, 'twas that no cloud might lower 
 On my young fame! — O hear! God of eternal power. 
 
 Loud oko- Now for the fight, — now for the cannon peal, — 
 TUND. Forward, — through blood and toil and cloud and 
 
 fire! 
 Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of steel. 
 The voUey's roll, the rocket's blasting spire; 
 They shake, — like broken waves their squares 
 retire, — 
 On them, hussars! — Now give them rein and heel; 
 
 Think of the orphaned child, the murdered sire: — 
 Earth cries for blood, — in thunder on them wheel! 
 This hour to Europe's fate shall set the triumph-seal !

 HAMLET'S mSTEUCTIOi^S. 
 
 Speak the speech^ I pray jou, as I po^o-nounced it to 
 you, trippingly on the tongue ; but if you mouth it, as 
 many of your players do, 1 had as lief the town crier 
 spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much 
 with your hand, thus; but use all gently : for in the 
 very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind 
 of your passion, you" must acquire and beget a tem- 
 perance that may give it smoothness. Oh ! it offends 
 me to the soul, to hear a robustious, periwig-pated 
 fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split 
 the ears of the groundlings ; who for the most part, 
 are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows 
 and noise. I would have a fellow whipped for o'er- 
 doing Termagant ; it out-herods Herod ; pray you 
 avoid it. 
 
 Be not too tame neither, but let your own discre- 
 tion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the 
 word to the action, with this special observance, that 
 you o'erstep not the modesty of nature ; for anything 
 so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose 
 end, both at the first, and now, was, and is, to hold, 
 as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue 
 her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very

 NoW; tbis overdone, or come tardy off, though it 
 make the unskillful laugh, can not but make the 
 judicious grieve ; the censure of the which one must, 
 in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theater of 
 others. Oh there be players that I have seen play, 
 — and heard others praise, and that highly, — not to 
 speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of 
 Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, or Turk, 
 have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought 
 some of N^ature's journeymen had made men, and not 
 made them well, they imitated humanity so abom- 
 inably. — Sliahespeare . 
 
 THE ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT. 
 
 I can not forbear regretting here, that a matter 
 of such vast importance to preaching, as deliver}^, 
 should be so generally neglected or misunderstood. 
 A common apprehension prevails, indeed, that a 
 strict regard to these rules would be deemed theatri- 
 cal ; and the dread, perhaps, of incurring this imputa- 
 tion is a restraint upon many. Bat is it not possible 
 ' to obtain a just and expressive manner, perfectly 
 consistent with the gravity of the pulpit, and yet 
 quite distinct from the more passionate, strong, and 
 diversified action of the theatre ? And is it not pos- 
 sible to hit off this manner so easily and naturally, 
 as to leave no room for just reflection? An affair 
 this, it must be owned, of the utmost delicacy ; in 
 which we shall probably often miscarry, and meet 
 with abundance of censure at first. But, still, I imagine, 
 that through the regulations of taste, the improve-

 ments of experience, the corrections of friendship, the 
 feelings of piety, and the gradual mellowings of time, 
 such an elocution may be acquired, as is above de- 
 lineated ; and such as, wlcen acquired, will make its 
 way to the hearts of the hearers, through their ears 
 and eyes, with a delight to both that is seldom felt ; 
 while, contrary to what is now practiced, it will ap- 
 pear to the former the very language of nature, and 
 present to the latter the lively image of the 'preacher's 
 soul. Were a taste for this kind of elocution to take 
 place, it is dif&cult to say how much the preaching 
 art would gain by it. Pronunciation would be stud- 
 ied, an ear would be formed, the voice would be 
 modulated, every feature of the face, every motion 
 of the hands, every posture of the body, would be 
 brought under right management. A graceful, and 
 correct, and animated expression in all these would 
 be ambitiously sought after; mutual criticisms and 
 friendly hints would be universally acknowledged ; 
 light and direction would be borrowed from ever}" 
 quarter, and from every age. The best models of 
 antiquity would in a particular manner be admired, 
 surveyed, and imitated. The sing-song voice, and 
 the see-saw gestures, if I may be allowed to use 
 those expressions, would, of course, be exploded ; 
 and, in time, nothing would be admitted, at least ap- 
 proved, among performers, ' but what was decent, 
 manly, and truly excellent in kind. Even the people 
 themselves would contract, insensibly, a growing 
 relish -for such a manner; and'those j^reachers would 
 at last be in chief repute with all, who followed 
 nature, overlooked themselves, appeared totally ab- 
 sorbed in the subject, and spoke with real propriety 
 and pathos, from the immediate impulse of truth 
 and virtue. — J amies Fordyce.

 THE CYNIC. 
 
 The Cynic is one who never sees a good qiiaUty 
 ill a man, and never fails to see a had one. He is the 
 human owl, vigilcint in darkness and hlhid to light, 
 mousing for vermin, and never seeing noble game. 
 
 The Cynic puts all human actions into only 
 two classes — oj^enly bad, and secretly bad. All virtue, 
 and generosity, and disinterestedness, are merely the 
 api^earance of good, but selfish at the bottom. He 
 holds that no man does a good thing except for profit. 
 The efi'ect of his conversation upon your feelings is 
 to chill and sear them ; to send you away sour and 
 morose. 
 
 His criticisms and innuendoes fall indiscrim- 
 inately upon every lovely tiling^ like frost upon the 
 flowers. If Mr. A is pronounced a religious man, he 
 will reply: yes^ on Sundays. Mr. B has joined the 
 church : certainly ; the elections are coming on. The 
 minister of the gospel is called an example of dili- 
 gence : it is his trade. Such a man is generous : oj

 ings are. If he encourages a noble generosity, every 
 feeling will be enriched by it ; if he nurse bitter and 
 envenomed thoughts, his own spirit will absorb the

 DEFINITION OF ELOQUENCE. 
 
 When public bodies are to be addressed on mo- 
 mentous occasions, when great interests are at stake, 
 and strong passions excited, nothing is valuable in 
 speech, farther than it is connected with high intel- 
 lectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force, 
 and earnestness are the qualities which produce con- 
 viction. True eloquence indeed does not consist in 
 speech ; it cannot be brought from far. Labor and 
 learning may toil for it, but they toil for it in vain : 
 words and phrases my be marshaled in every way, but 
 they can not compass it : it must exist in the man, 
 in the subject, and in the occasion. Aifected passion, 
 intense expression, the pomp of declamation, — all 
 may aspire after it ; they can not reach it : it comes, 
 if it come at all, like the outbreaking of a fountain 
 from the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires, 
 with spontaneous, original, native force. — Webster.

 [ Personation, male and female. Be careful to give the distinction of 
 the male and female voice. High pitch, vehement force, for female; 
 low pitch, vehement force, for male.] 
 
 Mister Socrates Snooks, a lord of creation, 
 
 The second time entered the marriage relation : 
 
 Xantippe Caloric accepted his hand, 
 
 And they thought him the happiest man in the land. 
 
 But scarce had the honeymoon passed over his head, 
 
 When, one morning, to Xantippe, Socrates said, 
 
 " I think, for a man of my standing in life, 
 
 This house is too small, as I now have a wife : 
 
 So, as early as possible, carpenter Gary 
 
 Shall be sent for to widen my house and my dairy." 
 
 " Now, Socrates, dearest," (Xantippe replied,) 
 
 "I hate to hear everything vulgarly my\l; 
 
 Now, whenever you speak of your chattels again, 
 
 Say, ow cow-house, our barnyard, oui' pig-pen." 
 
 " By you leave, Mrs. Snooks, I will say what I please 
 
 OY my houses, my lands, my gardens, my trees." 
 
 " Say our^^' Xantippe exclaimed in a rage. 
 
 " I won't, Mrs. Snooks, though 3'ou ask it an age ! " 
 
 Oh, woman ! though only a part of man's rib, 
 
 (If the story in Genesis do n't tell a fib,) 
 
 Should your naughty companion e'er quarrel with 
 
 you, 
 You are certain to prove the best man of the two. 
 In the following case this was certainly true ; 
 For the lovety Xantippe just pulled off her shoe, 
 And laying about her, all sides at random. 
 The adage was verified — ^^Nil desperaridum''

 Mister Socrates Snooks, after trying in vain, 
 To ward off the blows that descended like rain, — 
 Concluding that valor's best part was discretion, — 
 Crept under the bed like a terrified Hessian : 
 But the dauntless Xantippe, not one whit afraid. 
 Converted the siege into a blockade. 
 
 At last, after reasoning the thing in his pate, 
 
 He concluded 't was useless to strive against fate ; 
 
 And so, like a tortoise protruding his head. 
 
 Said, "My dear, may we come out from under our 
 
 bed?" 
 " Hah ! hah ! " she exclaimed, " Mr. Socrates Snooks, 
 I perceive you agree to my terms, by your looks : 
 Now, Socrates, — hear me, — from this happy hour, 
 If you'll only obey me, I'll never look sour." 
 'Tis said the next Sabbath, ere going to church, 
 He chanced for a clean pair of trowsers to search : 
 Having found them, he asked, with a few nervous 
 
 twitches, 
 " My dear, may we put on our new Sunday breeches ? " 
 
 EVENING AT THE FAllM. 
 
 Over the hill the farm-boy goes. 
 
 His shadow lengthens along the land, 
 
 A giant staff in a giant hand ; 
 
 In the poplar tree above the spring. 
 
 The katy-did begins to sing ; 
 
 The early dews are falling ; — 
 Into the stone-heap darts the mink ; 
 The swallows skim the river's brink ; 
 And home to the woodland fly the crows.

 When over the hill the farm-bo}^ .goes. 
 Cheerily calling, 
 
 " Co', boss ! co', boss ! co' ! co' ! co' ! " 
 Farther, farther over the hill, 
 Faintly calling, calling still,

 Now to her task the milkmaid goes. 
 
 The cattle come crowding through the gate, 
 
 Looing, pushing, little and great ; 
 
 About the trough, by the barn-yard pump, 
 
 The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump, 
 
 While the pleasant dews are falling ; — 
 The new milch heifer is quick and sh}^, 
 But the old cow waits with tranquil eye, 
 And the white stream into the bright pail flowS, 
 When to her task the milkmaid goes. 
 Soothingly calling, 
 ''So, boss! so, boss! so! so! so!" 
 The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool, 
 And sits and milks in the twilight cool. 
 Saying, "So ! so, boss ! so ! so ! " 
 
 To supper at last the farmer goes. 
 The apples are pared, the paper read. 
 The stories are told, then all to bed. 
 Without, the crickets' ceaseless song 
 Makes shrill the silence all night long ; 
 
 The heavy dews are falling. 
 The housewife's hand has turned the lock ; 
 Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock ; 
 The household sinks to deep repose,

 HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY. 
 
 Hamlet : — To he, or not to be : that is the question : 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 The stings and arrows of outrageous fortune. 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing end them? To die, — to sleej), — 
 No more ; and by a sleep to say we end 
 The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 
 That flesh is heir to, — 'tis a consummation 
 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; 
 To sleep! perchance to dream; — ay, there's the rub ; 
 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
 Must give u^ pause: there's the respect 
 That makes calamity of so long life : 
 For who would bear the whips and scoims of time, 
 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's co7itumely, 
 The jjangs of despised love, the law's delay. 
 The insolence of office, and the spurns 
 That patient merit of the unworthy takes. 
 When he himself might his quietus make 
 With a bare hodkin? who v^ovldi fardels bear, 
 To grunt and sweat under a weary life. 
 But, that the dread of something after death,

 The undiscovered coiiiiUy I'rom whose bourne 
 
 No traveler returns, puzzles the will, 
 
 And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
 
 Than fly to others that we know not of? 
 
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ; 
 
 And thus the native hue of resolution 
 
 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ; 
 
 And enterprises of great pith and moment, 
 
 With this regard, their currents turn awry, 
 
 And lose the name of action.

 A LEGEND OF BEEGENZ. 
 
 Girt round with rugged mountains, the fair Lake 
 Constance lies ; in her blue heart reflected shine back 
 the starry skies ; and, watching each white cloudlet 
 float silently and slow, you think a piece of heaven 
 lies on our earth below ! 
 
 Midnight is there ; and silence, enthroned in 
 heaven, looks down upon her own calm mirror, upon 
 a sleeping town : for Bregenz, that quaint city upon 
 the Tyrol shore, has stood above Lake Constance a 
 thousand years or nnore. Her battlements and tow- 
 ers, from off their rocky steep, have cast their tremb- 
 ling shadow for ages on the deep. Mountain, and 
 lake, and valley, a sacred legend know, of how the 
 town was saved, one night, three hundred years ago. 
 
 Far from her home and kindred a Tyrol maid 
 had fled, to serve in the Swiss valleys, and toil for 
 daily bread ; and every year that fleeted so silently 
 and fast, seemed to bear farther from her the mem- 
 ory of the past. She served kind, gentle masters,

 nor asked for rest or change ; her friends seemed no 
 more new ones, their speech seemed no more strange; 
 and when she led her cattle to pasture every day, 
 she ceased to look and wonder on which side Bre- 
 genz lay. She spoke no more of Bregenz, with long- 
 ing and with tears ; her Tyrol home seemed faded in 
 a deep mist of years. She heeded not the rumors 
 of Austrian war and strife; each day she rose con- 
 tented to the calm toils of life. Yet, when her mas- 
 ter's children would clustering round her stand, she 
 sang them ancient ballads of her own native land ; 
 and when at morn and evening she knelt before 
 God's throne, the accents of her childhood rose to 
 her lips alone. 
 
 And so she dwelt : the valley more peaceful year 
 by year; when suddenly strange portents of some 
 great deed seemed near. The golden corn was bend- 
 ing upon its fragile stalk, while farmers, heedless of 
 their fields, paced up and down in talk. The men 
 seemed stern and altered, with looks cast on the 
 ground ; with anxious faces, one by one, the women 
 gathered round ; all talk of flax, or spinning, or 
 work was put away ; the very children seemed 
 afraid to go alone to play. 
 
 One day, out in the meadow with strangers from 
 the town, some secret plan discussing, the men 
 walked up and down ; yet now and then seemed 
 watching a strange, uncertain gleam, that looked like 
 lances 'mid the trees that stood below the stream. 
 
 At eve they all assembled, then care and doubt 
 were fled ; with jovial laugh they feasted ; the board 
 was nobly spread. The elder of the village rose up, 
 his glass in hand, and cried, "We drink the downfall

 of an accursed land ! The night is growing darker, 
 ere one more day is floAvn, Bregenz, our foemen's 
 stronghold, Bregenz shall be our own !'" 
 
 The women shrank in terror (yet pride, too, had 
 her part), but one poor Tyrol maiden felt death 
 within her heart. Before her stood fair Bregenz ; 
 once more her towers arose ; what were the friends 
 beside her ? Only her country's foes ! The faces of 
 her kinsfolk, the days of childhood flown, the echoes 
 of her mountains, reclaimed her as their own. jSToth- 
 ing she heard around her (though shouts rang forth 
 again) ; gone were the green Swiss valleys, the pas- 
 ture and the plain ; before her eyes one vision, and 
 in her heart one cry, that said, "Go forth, save 
 Bregenz, and then, if need be, die !" 
 
 With trembling haste and breathless, with noise- 
 less step, she sped ; horses and weary cattle Avere 
 standing in the shed ; she loosed the strong, white 
 charger, that fed from out her hand, she mounted, 
 and she turned his head toward her native land. 
 Out — out into the darkness — faster, and still more 
 fast ; the smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut 
 wood is past ; she looks up ; clouds are heavy ; why 
 is her steed so slow? — scarcely the wind beside them 
 can pass them as they go. 
 
 "Faster!" she cries, "Oh, faster!" Eleven the 
 church-bells chime: "O Grod," she cries, "help Bre- 
 genz, and bring me there in time ! " But louder than 
 bells' ringing, or lowing of the kine, grows nearer in 
 the midnight the rushing of the Ehine. Shall not 
 the roaring waters their headlong gallop check? 
 The steed draws back in terror, — she leans upon his 
 neck to watch the flowing darkness ; the bank is

 high and steep ; one pause — ho staggers forward, 
 and phmges m the deep. She strives to pierce the 
 blackness, and looser throws the rein ; her steed 
 must breast the waters that dash above his mane. 
 How gallantly, how nobly, he struggles through the 
 foam, and see — in the far distance shine out the 
 lights of home ! Up the steep bank he bears her, 
 and now they rush again toward the heights of Bre- 
 genz, that tower above the plain. They reach the 
 gate of Bregenz just as the midnight rings, and out 
 come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings. 
 
 Bregenz is saved ! Ere daylight her battlements 
 are manned ; defiance greets the army that marches 
 on the land. And if to deeds heroic should endless 
 fame be paid, Bregenz does well to honor the noble 
 Tyrol maid. 
 
 Three hundred years are vanished, and yet upon 
 the hill an old stone gateway rises, to do her honor 
 still. And there, Avhen Bregenz women sit spinning 
 in the shade, they see in quaint, old carving the 
 Charger and the Maid. And when, to guard old 
 Bregenz, by gateway, street, and tower, the warder 
 paces all night long and calls each passing hour : 
 "nine," "ten," "eleven," he cries aloud, and then (O 
 crown of Fame !) when midnight pauses in the skies, 
 he calls the maiden's name. — Adelaide Procter.

 SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS. 
 
 The war must go on. We must fight it through. 
 And if the war must go on, why put off longer the 
 Declaration of Independence? That measure will 
 strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. 
 Why then, sir, do we not, as soon as possible, change 
 this from a civil to a national war? And since we 
 must fight it through, why not put ourselves in a state 
 to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if we gain the 
 victory? If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But 
 we shall not fail. The cause will raise up armies ; 
 the cause will create navies. The people, — the people, 
 if we are true to them, will carry us and will carry 
 themselves gloriously through this struggle. 
 
 I care not how fickle other people have been 
 found. I know the people of these colonies ; and I 
 know that resistance to British aggression is deep 
 and settled in their hearts, and can not be eradicated. 
 Every colony, indeed, has expressed its willingness 
 to follow, if we but take the lead. Sir, the declara-

 tion will inspire the people with increased courage. 
 Instead of a long and bloody war for restoration of 
 privileges, for redress of grievances, for chartered 
 immunities^ held under a British king, set before 
 them the glorious object of entire independence, and 
 it will breathe into them anew the breath of life. 
 
 Eead this declaration at the head of the army; 
 every sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and 
 the solemn vow uttered, to maintain it or to perish 
 on the bed of honor. Publish it from the pul])it ; re- 
 ligion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty 
 will cling round it, resolved to stand with it or fall 
 with it. Send it to the public halls ; proclaim it there ; 
 let them hear it, who heard the first roar of the 
 enemy's cannon ; let them see it, who saAv their 
 brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker 
 Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, 
 and the very walls will cry out in its support. 
 
 Sir, I know the uncertainty of human aftairs ; 
 but I see, I see clearly through this day's business. 
 You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to 
 the time when this declaration shall be made good. 
 We may die ; die colonists ; die slaves ; die, it may 
 be, ignominiously, and on the scaffold. Be it so. 
 Be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my 
 country shall require the poor offering of my life, the 
 victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sac- 
 nfice, come when that hour may. But while I do 
 live, let me have a country (or at least the hope of a 
 country), and that a/ree country. 
 
 But whatever may be our fate, — be assured, be 
 assured, that this declaration will stand. It may 
 cost treasure, and it may cost blood ; but it will stand,

 and it will richly compensate for both. Through the 
 thick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of 
 the future, as the sun in heaven. We shall make 
 this a glorious^ an immortal day. When we are in 
 our graves, our children will honor it. They will 
 celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with 
 bonfires, and illuminations. On its annual return 
 they will shed, tears, copious, gushing tears, not of 
 subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, 
 but of exultation, of gratitude, and of joy. 
 
 Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. 
 My judgment approves this measure, and my whole 
 heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am, 
 and all that I hope in this life, 1 am now ready here 
 to stake upon it ; and I leave off as I began, that 
 live or die, survive or perish, I am for the declara- 
 tion. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing 
 of God it shall be my dying eentiment ; independence 
 now ; and independence forever. — Webster.

 In all the dungeons of the old Avorld, where the

 tivity beneath the remorseless power of the tyrant, 
 the morning sun does not send a glimmering ray 
 into their cells, nor does night draw a thicker vail of 
 darkness between them and the world, but the lone 
 prisoner lifts his iron-laden arms to Heaven in prayer, 
 that we, the depositaries of freedom and of human 
 hopes, may be faithful to our sacred trust ; while, on 
 the other hand, the pensioned advocates of despot- 
 ism stand, with listening ear, to catch* the first sound

 turbulence and devastation, or a deed of perfidy or 
 breach of faith, monarchs point them out as fruits 
 of the growth and omens of the fate of republics, 
 and claim for themselves and their heirs a further 
 extension of the lease of despotism. 
 
 The experience of the ages that are past, the 
 hopes of the ages that are yet to come, unite their 
 voices in an appeal to us ; they implore us to think, 
 more of the character of our people than of its num- 
 bers ; to look upon our vast natural resources, not as 
 tempters to ostentation and pride, but as a means to 
 be converted, by the refining alchemy of education, 
 into mental and spiritual treasures ; they supplicate 
 us to seek for whatever complacency or self-satisfac- 
 tion we are disposed to indulge, not in the extent of 
 our territory, or in the products of our soil, but in 
 the expansion and perpetuation of the same means 
 of human happiness ; they beseech us to exchange 
 the luxuries of sense for the joys of charity, and thus 
 give to the world the example of a nation whose 
 Avisdom increases with its prosperity, and whose vir- 
 tues are equal to its power. For these ends they en- 
 join upon us a more earnest, a more universal, a 
 more religious devotion to our exertions and re- 
 sources, to the culture of the youthful mind and 
 heart of the nation. Their gathered voices assert 
 the eternal truth, that, in a republic^ ignorance is a 
 crime ; and that private immorality is not less an 
 opprobrium, to the state than is guilt in the perpetra- 
 tor. — H. Mann.

 This, fellow citizens, am the Fourth of July, — 
 a day worthy to be the first day of the year, and a 
 day which will be emblazoned by our latest posper- 
 ity, when all other days have sunk into oblivious 
 non compos mentis. 
 
 This, fellow citizens, am the day when our 
 ancestral progenitors unanimously fought, bled and 
 died, in orclip.' that we and our children's children 
 might cut their own vine and fig tree without being 
 molested or daring to make any one afraid. 
 
 This am the Fourth of July, fellow citizens, 
 and who is there that can sit supinely downward on 
 this prognostic anniversary, and not revert their 
 mental reminisences to the great epochs of the Eev- 
 olution — to the blood bespangled plains of Bunker 
 Hill, Monmouth, Yorktown, and follow the heroic 
 heroes of those times through trackless snows, and 
 blood-stained deserts, to the eternal mansions of free 
 trade and sailor's rights ; and the adorable enjoy- 
 ments of the privileges and prerogatives, which fall 
 like heavenly dew upon every American citizen, 
 from the forests of Maine to the everglades of 
 Florida ; and from the fisheries of the Atlantic coast 
 to the yellow banks of California, where the jingling 
 of the golden boulders mixes up with the screams of 
 the catamount, and the mountain goat leaps from 
 rock to rock — and — and where — and — and — I thank 
 you, fellow citizens, for your considerable attention.

 INDUSTEY AND ELOQUENCE. 
 
 In the ancient republics of Greece and Eome, 
 oratory was a necessary branch of the finished edu- 
 cation. A much smaller proportion of the citizens 
 were educated than among us ; but of these a much 
 larger number became orators. No man could hope 
 for distinction or influence, and yet slight this art. 
 The commanders of their armies were orators as well 
 as soldiers, and ruled as well by their rhetorical as 
 by their military skill. There was no trusting with 
 them as with us, to a natural facility, or the acquisi- 
 tion of an accidental fluency by occasional practice. 
 
 They served an apprenticeship to the art. They 
 passed through a regular course of instruction in 
 schools. They submitted to long and laborious dis- 
 cipline. They exercised themselves frequently, both 
 before equals and in the presence of teachers, who 
 criticised, reproved, rebuked, excited emulation, and 
 left nothing undone which art and perseverance 
 could accomplish. 
 
 The greatest orators of antiquity, so far from 
 being favored by natural tendencies, except, indeed, 
 in their high intellectual endowments, had to struggle 
 against natural obstacles ; and, instead of growing 
 up spontaneously to their unrivaled eminence, they 
 forced themselves forward by the most discouraging, 
 artificial process. 
 
 Demosthenes combated an imj^ediment in speech 
 and an ungainliness of gesture, which, at first, drove 
 him from the forum in disgrace. Cicero failed, at 
 first, through weakness of lungs and an excessive

 vehemence of manner, which wearied the hearers 
 and defeated his own purpose. These defects were 
 conquered by study and discipline. He exiled him- 
 self from home, and, during his absence in various 
 lands, passed not a day without a rhetorical exercise, 
 seeking the masters who were most severe in criti- 
 cism, as the surest means of leading him to the per- 
 fection at which he aimed. 
 
 Such, too, was the education of their other great 
 men. They were all, according to their ability and 
 station, orators ; orators, not by nature or accident, 
 but by education^ formed in a strict process of rhe- 
 torical training. 
 
 The inference to be drawn from these observa- 
 tions is, that if so many of those who received an 
 accomplished education, became accomplished ora- 
 tors, because to become so was one purpose of their 
 study ; then, it is in the power of a much larger pro- 
 portion among us to form ourselves into creditable 
 and accurate speakers. The inference should not be 
 denied until proved false by experiment. 
 
 Let this art be made an object of attention ; 
 let young men train themselves to it faithfully and 
 long; and if any of competent talents and tolerable 
 science be found, at last, incapable of expressing 
 themselves in a continued and connected discourse, 
 so as to answer the ends of public speaking, then, and 
 not till then, let it be said, that a peculiar talent, or 
 natural aptitude, is requisite, the want of which must 
 render effort vain : then, and not till then, let us ac- 
 quiesce in this indolent and timorous notion, which 
 contradicts the whole testimony of antiquity and all 
 the experience of the world. — Wirt.

 THE BUENING SHIP. 
 
 The storm o'er the ocean flew furious and fast, 
 
 And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blast, 
 
 And heavily: labored the gale-beaten ship, 
 
 Like a stout-hearted swimmer, the spray at his lip ; 
 
 And dark was the sky o'er the mariners path. 
 
 Save when the wild lightning illumined in wrath. 
 
 A young mother knelt in the cabin below, 
 And pressing her babe to her bosom of snow. 
 She prayed to her God, 'mid the hurricane wild, 
 "O Father, have mercy, look down on my child !' 
 It passed, — the fierce whirlwind careered on its way. 
 And the ship like an arrow divided the spray ; 
 Her sails glimmered white in the beams of the moon, 
 And the wind up aloft seemed to whistle a tune, — to 
 whistle a tune. 
 
 There was J03' in the ship as she furrowed the foam, 
 For fond hearts within her were dreaming of home. 
 The young mother pressed her .fond babe to her 
 
 breast, 
 And the husband sat cheerily down by her side. 
 And looked with delight on the face of his bride, 
 "Oh, happy," said he, "when our roaming is o'er. 
 We '11 dwell in our cottage that stands by the shoi'e. 
 Already in fancy its roof I descry, 
 And the smoke of its hearth curling up to the sky ; 
 Its garden so green, and its vine-covered wall ; 
 The kind friends awaiting to welcome us all. 
 And the children that sport by the old oaken tree." 
 Ah gently the ship glided over the sea ! 
 Hark ! what was that? Hark ! Hark to the shout !

 '^Fire!'' Then a tramp and a rout, and an upvoav 
 
 of voices uprose on the air ; — 
 And the mother knelt down, and the half-spoken 
 
 prayer 
 That she offered to God in her agony wild, 
 Was, "Father, have mercy, look down on my child ! " 
 She flew to her husband, she clung to his side. 
 Oh ! there was her refuge whate'er might betide. 
 " Fire / " " Fire / " It was raging above and below ; — 
 And the cheeks of the sailors grew pale at the sight, 
 And their eyes glistened wild in the glare of the light. 
 'T was vain o'er the ravage the waters to drip ; 
 The pitiless flame was the lord of the ship. 
 And the smoke in thick wreaths mounted higher and 
 
 higher. 
 "O Grod ! it is fearful to perish by fire." 
 Alone with destruction, alone on the sea, 
 "Great Father of mercy, our hope is in thee." 
 
 Sad at heart, and resigned, yet undaunted and brave. 
 They lowered the boat, a mere speck on the wave. 
 First entered the mother, enfolding her child : 
 It knew she caressed it, looked upward and smiled. 
 Cold, cold was the night as they drifted away. 
 And mistily dawned o'er the pathway the day : — 
 And they prayed for the light, and at noontide about, 
 The sun o'er the waters shone joyously out. 
 
 ^- Ho ! a sail!''' ^^ Ho ! a sail!" cried the man at the 
 
 lea, 
 ^'- Ho ! a sail!" and they turned their glad eyes o'er 
 
 the sea. 
 " They see us, they see us, the signal is waved ! 
 They bear down upon us, they bear down upon us : 
 Huzza! we are saved!'

 'Twas in the summer of '46 that I landed at 
 Hamilton, fresh as a new pratie just dug from the 
 "ould sod," and wid a light heart and a heavy bun- 
 dle I sot off for the township of Buford, tiding a taste 
 of a song, as merry a young fellow as iver took the 
 road. Well I trudged on and on, past many a plisint 
 place, pleasin' myself wid the thought that some day

 I might have a place of my own, wid a world of 
 chickens and ducks and pigs and childer about the 
 door; and along in the afternoon of the sicond day 
 I got to Buford village. A cousin of me mother's, 
 one Dennis O'Dowd, lived about sivin miles from 
 there, and I wanted to make his place that night ; 
 so I inquired the way at the tavern, and was lucky 
 to find a man who was goin' part of the way an' 
 would show me the way to find Dennis. Sure he 
 was very kind indade, an' when I got out of his 
 wagon he pointed me through the wood and tould 
 me to go straight south a mile an' a half, and the 
 first house would be Dennis's. 
 
 "An' you've no time to lose now," said he, "for 
 the sun is low, and mind you don't get lost in the 
 woods." 
 
 "Is it lost now," said I, "that I'd be gittin, an' 
 me uncle as great a navigator as iver steered a ship 
 across the thrackless say ! 'Not a bit of it, though 
 I 'm obleeged to ye for your kind advice, and thank 
 yiz for the ride." 
 
 An' wid that he drove off an' left me alone. I 
 shouldered me bundle bravely, an' whistlin' a bit of 
 time for company like, I pushed into the bush. Well, 
 I went a long way over bogs, and turnin' round 
 among the bush an' trees till I began to think I must 
 be well nigh to Dennis's. But, bad cess to it ! all of 
 a sudden I came out of the woods at the very 
 identical spot where I started in, which I knew by 
 an ould crotched tree that seemed to be standin' on 
 its head and|kickin' up its heels to make divarsion 
 of me. By this time it was growin' dark, and as 
 there was no time to lose, I started in a second time,

 determiued to keep straight south this time, and 
 make no mistake. I got on bravely for awhile, but 
 och hone ! och hone ! it got so dark I couldn't see 
 the trees, and I bumped me nose and barked me 
 shins, while the miskaties bit me hands and face to 
 a blister; an' after tumblin' and stumblin' around till 
 I was fairly bamboozled, I sat down on a log all of a 
 trimble, to think that I was lost intirely, an' that 
 maybe a lion or some other wild craythur would 
 devour me before morning. 
 
 Just then I heard somebody a long way oif say, 
 " Whip poor Will ! Whip poor Will ! " "Bedad," sez 
 I, "I'm glad it isn't Jamie that's got to take it, 
 though it's more in sorrow than in anger they are 
 doin' it, or why should they say 'poor Will?' an' 
 sure they can 't be Injun, haythin, or naygur, for it 's 
 plain English they're afther spakin'. Maybe they 
 might help me out o' this," so I shouted at the top of 
 my voice, "A lost man ! " Then I listened. Prisently 
 an answer came. 
 
 "Who? Whoo? Whooo?" 
 
 "Jamie Butler, the waiver!" sez I, as loud as I 
 could roar, an' snatchin' up me bundle an' stick, I 
 started in the direction of the voice. Whin I thought 
 1 had got near the place, I stopped and shouted 
 again, "A lost man ! " 
 
 "Who ! Whoo ! Whooo ! " said a voice right over 
 my head. 
 
 "Sure," thinks I, "it's a mighty quare place for 
 a man to be at this time of night ; maybe it 's some 
 settler scrapin' sugar off a sugar-bush for the chil- 
 dren's breakfast in the mornin'. But Avhere's Will 
 and the rest of them?" All this went through me 
 head like a flash, an' thin I answered his inquiiy.

 "Jamie Butler, the waiver," eez I; "and if it 
 wouldn't inconvanience yer honor, would yez be kind 
 enough to step down and show me the way to the 
 house of Dennis O'Dowd?" 
 
 "Who! Whoo! Whooo ! " sez he. 
 
 "Dennis O'Dowd," sez I, civil enough, "and a 
 dacent man he is, and first cousin to my own mother." 
 
 " Who ! Whoo ! Whooo ! " sez he again. 
 
 "Me mother!" sez I, "and as fine a woman as 
 iver peeled a biled pratie wid her thumb nail, and 
 her maiden name was Molly McFiggin."

 Paddy McFiggin, I say — do you hear that? An' he 
 was the tallest man in all the county Tipperary,

 and break every bone in your skin, ye spalpeen, so

 "Who! Whoo! Whooo!" sez he, as impident as 
 iver. 
 
 I said never a word, but lavin' down me bundle, 
 and takin' me stick in me teeth, I began to climb 
 the tree. Whin I got among the branches I looked 
 quietly around till I saw a pair of big eyes just for- 
 ninst me. 
 
 "Whist," sez I, "and I'll let him have a taste of 
 an Irish stick," and wid that I let drive and lost me 
 balance an' came tumblin' to the ground, nearly 
 breakin' me neck wid the fall. When I came to mo

 goose egg, and half of me Smiday coat-tail torn off 
 intirely. I spoke to the chap in the tree, but could 
 git niver an answer, at all, at all. 
 
 Sure, thinks I, he must have gone home to rowl 
 up his head, for by the poAvers I didn't throw me 
 stick for nothin'. 
 
 Well, by this time the moon was up and I could 
 see a little, and I detarmined to make one more 
 eifort to reach Dennis's. 
 
 I wint on cautiously for awhile, an' thin I heard 
 a bell. "Sure," sez I, "I'm comin' to a settlement 
 now, for I hear the church bell." I kept on toward 
 the sound till I came to an ould cow wid a bell on. 
 She started to run, but I was too quick for her, and 
 got her by the tail and hung on, thinkin' that maybe 
 she would take me out of the woods. On we wint, 
 like an ould country steeple-chase, till, sure enough, 
 we came out to a clearin' and a house in sight wid a 
 light in it. So, leavin' the ould cow puffin' and 
 blowin' in a shed, I went to the house, and as luck 
 would have it, whose should it be but Dennis's. 
 
 He gave me a raal Irish welcome, and introduced 
 me to his two daughters — as purty a pair of girls as 
 iver ye clapped an eye on. Eut whin I told him me 
 adventure in the woods, and about the fellow who 
 made fun of me, they all laughed and roared, and 
 Dennis said it was an owl. 
 
 "An ould what?" sez I. 
 
 "Why, an owl, a bird," sez he. 
 
 "Do ye tell me now?" sez I, "Sure it's a quare 
 country and a quare biird." 
 
 And thin they all laughed again, till at last I

 With that grim ferryman, which 2)oets write of, 
 Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 
 The first that there did greet my stranger soul 
 Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, 
 Who cried, — " What scourge for perjury 
 Can this dark monarchy afford /a^se Clarence?" 
 And so he vanished ; then came wandering by 
 A shadow like an angel, with bright hair 
 Dabbled in blood ; and he shriek' d out aloud, 
 "Clarence is come — false, fleeting, perjured

 That stabb'd me, in the field by Tewkesbury. 
 Seize on him. Furies ; take him into torments ! ''' 
 With that, methought a legion of foul fiends 
 Environ'd me, and hoided in mine ears 
 Such hideous cries, that with the very noise 
 I trembling wak'd, and for a season after 
 Could not believe but that I was in hell ! 
 Such terrible impression made my dream. 
 Oh, Brackenbury, I have done those things 
 That now give evidence against the soul^

 And sifting snows fall white and fast, 
 Mark Haley drives along the street, 
 Perched high upon his wagon seat ; 
 His sombre face the storm defies. 
 And thus from morn till eve he cries — 
 
 " Charco' I charco' ! " 
 While echo faint and far replies — 
 
 "Hark, 01 hark, 0!" 
 "Charco' !" — "Hark, O !" — Such cheery sounds.

 The dust begrimes his ancient hat ; 
 
 His coat is darker far than that ; 
 
 'Tis odd to see his sooty form 
 
 All speckled with the feathery storm. 
 
 Yet in his honest bosom lies 
 
 No spot, nor speck — though still he cries, 
 
 " Charco' ! charco' ! " 
 And many a roguish lad replies — 
 
 "Ark, ho ! ark, ho !" 
 " Charco' ! " — " Ark, ho ! " — Such various sounds 
 Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds.

 He labors much for little pay. 
 Yet feels no less of happiness

 When through the shades of eve he spies

 When he has closed his daily rounds. 
 
 The hearth is warm, the fire is bright ; 
 
 And while his hand, washed clean and white, 
 
 Holds Martha's tender hand once more, 
 
 His glowing face bends fondly o'er

 And in a coaxing tone he cries,

 THE BELLS OF SHAKDON. 
 
 [The church of Shandon is built on the ruins of Shandon Castle, and 
 is a prominent object to the traveler as he approaches the city of Cork 
 from any direction. Father Prout, or the Rev. Francis Mahoney, which 
 was his true name, was a native of Cork.] 
 
 With deep affection and recollection, 
 
 I often think of those Shandon bells. 
 
 Whose sounds so wild would, in days of childhood, 
 
 Fling round my cradle their magic spell. 
 
 On this I ponder where'er I wander. 
 
 And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee. 
 
 With thy bells of Shandon 
 
 That sound so grand on 
 The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
 
 I Ve heard bell's tolling " old Adrian's Mole in," 
 
 Their thunder rolling from the Yatican, 
 
 And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
 
 In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame : 
 
 But thy sound was sweeter than the dome of Peter 
 
 Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly. 
 
 O ! the bells of Shandon 
 
 Sound far more grand on 
 The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
 
 There's a bell in Moscow, while on tower and kiosko 
 
 In St. Sophia the Turkman gets. 
 
 And loud in air calls men to prayer 
 
 From the tapering summit of tall minarets. 
 
 Such empty phantoms, I freely grant them ; 
 
 But there's an anthem more dear to me, — 
 
 'Tis the bells of Shandon, 
 
 That sound so grand on 
 The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
 
 — Father Prout.

 THE CATAEACT OF LODOEE. 
 
 [Rapid Movement.] 
 
 How does the water 
 Come down at Lodore ? 
 
 From its sources which well 
 In the tarn on the fell ; 
 
 From its fountains 
 
 In the mountains, 
 Its rills and its gills ; 
 
 Through moss and through brake 
 It runs and it creeps, 
 For a while, till it sleeps 
 
 In its own little lake. 
 And thence at departing, 
 Awakening and starting. 
 It runs through the reeds. 
 And away it proceeds, 
 Through meadow and glade, 
 In sun and in shade, 
 And through the wood-shelter, 
 
 Among crags in its flurry, 
 Helter-skelter, 
 
 Hurry- skurry. 
 
 Here it comes sparkling. 
 And there it lies darkling ; 
 JS'ow smoking and frothing, 
 Its tumult and wrath in, 
 Till in this rapid race, 
 
 On which it is bent, 
 It reaches the place 
 
 Of its steep descent.

 The cataract strong 
 Then plumges along, 
 Striking and raging, 
 As if a war waging 
 Its caverns and rocks among ; 
 Spouting and frisking, 
 Turning and twisting, 
 Around and around 
 With endless rebound : 
 Smiting and fighting, 
 A sight to delight in. 
 Confounding, astounding, 
 Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound. 
 
 Eetreating and beating and meeting and sheeting, 
 Delaying and straying and playing and spraying. 
 Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing, 
 And gleaming and streaming and steaming and 
 
 beaming. 
 And dashing and flashing and splashing^and clashing, 
 And so never ending, but always descending. 
 Sounds and motions forever and ever are blending. 
 All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar : 
 And this way, the water comes down at Lodore. 
 
 NOBODY'S CHILD. 
 
 [This should be rendered in the tender, pathetic voice of a child, 
 and, when so given, it is exquisitely beautiful. The sad, touching voice 
 should kindle with expectation at the close.] 
 
 Alone in the dreary, pitiless street, 
 With my torn old dress, and bare cold feet, 
 All day have I wandered to and fro. 
 Hungry and shivering, and no where to go :

 The night's coming on in darkness and dread, 
 And the chill sleet beating upon my bare head. 
 Oh ! why does the wind blow upon me so wild? 
 Is it because I am nobody's child? 
 
 Just over the way there's a flood of light, 
 
 And warmth, and beauty, and all things bright ; 
 
 Beautiful children, in robes so fair, 
 
 Are caroling songs in their rapture there. 
 
 1 wonder if they, in their blissful glee. 
 
 Would pity a poor little beggar like me, 
 
 Wandering alone in the merciless street, 
 
 [Naked and shivering, and nothing to eat? 
 
 Oh ! what shall I do when the night comes down 
 
 In its terrible blackness all over the town? 
 
 Shall I lay me down 'neath the angry sky. 
 
 On the cold hard pavement, alone to die. 
 
 When the beautiful children their prayers have said. 
 
 And their mammas have tucked them up snugly in 
 
 bed? 
 For no dear mother on me ever smiled. 
 Why is it, I wonder, I'm nobody's child? 
 
 No father, no mother, no sister, not one 
 In all the world loves me, e'en the little dogs run 
 When I wander too near them ; 'tis wondrous to see 
 How everything shrinks from a beggar like me ! 
 Perhaps 'tis a dream ; but sometimes, when I lie 
 Gazing far up in the dark blue sky. 
 Watching for hours some large bright star, 
 Ffancy the beautiful gates are ajar.

 And a host of whitc-robod, nameless things, 
 
 Come fluttering o'er me on gilded wings ; 
 
 A hand that is strangely soft and fair 
 
 Caresses gently my tangled hair, 
 
 And a voice like the carol of some wild bird — 
 
 The sweetest voice that was ever heard — 
 
 Calls me many a dear, pet name. 
 
 Till my heart and spirit are all aflame. 
 
 They tell me of such unbounded love, 
 And bid me come up to their home above ; 
 And then with such pitiful, sad surprise, 
 They look at me with their sweet tender eyes, 
 And it seems to me, out of the dreary night 
 I am going up to that world of light ; 
 And away from the hunger and storm so wild 
 1 am sure I shall then be somebody's child.
