PREFACE.
This is the shortest treatise on the Art of
Reading that has ever been written in the
English language ; yet, short as it is, it is of
more practical value than are all the others-
which is not saying much in its praise, for all
the others are of no practical value whatever.
The mode of procedure herein recom-
mended, in order to become skilled in elocu-
tion, is wholly unlike anything that has
hitherto found its way into print. Yet what
is here is older than the oldest of the vener.
able "systems" that have come down to us
from former generations, for what is here
dates back to the time when men began to
exchange ideas by means of a spoken lan-
guage. Then, as ever, the sensible man-
spoke he his own language or that of another
-spoke naturally, and not as the elocution of
the books, and of most teachers of the art,
would have us speak, for that tends to make
only bow-wowers and sing-songers.

NOTE.
It has been intimated that this little book
owes its success to the exceeding modesty of
its preface. I do not think so; I think it
owes its success to the fact that it is just the
sort of book its preface says it is.
The matter I have added-An Essay on
Pulpit Elocution, A Plea for the Intellectual
in Elocution, The Pause-Its Importance, and
A Critical Analysis of Canon Fleming's read-
ing of certain passages in Shakespeare — will
make the book much more instructive, pro-
vided the student take the trouble to decide
how far I am right in criticizing the learned
Canon. These pages offer such a field for the
practice of mental gymnastics as is seldom
met with. Elocutionists can not, I am con-
fident, be better employed than in studying
them.

THE
ESSENTIALS OF ELOCUTION.
ELOCUTION is the art of speaking lan.
guage so as to make the thought it ex-
presses clear and impressive.
This is best done by speaking the lan-
guage as we should speak it if the
thought were ours, and the language
came to us as we give it utterance.
If the thought were ours, and we
extemporized the language to express it,
we should never fail to speak with“good
accent and good discretion;" we should
never fail to speak naturally and intel-
ligently, and consequently impressively.
If this is true—and who will question
it then the first, the most important

thing to be attended to by the reader is
to make himself acquainted with the
author's thought. If he does not do this,
and do it thoroughly too, good reading
is impossible-ay, though he may be the
most learned of the learned in orotunds,
sostenutos, whispers and half-whispers,
monotones, basilar tones, and guttural
tones, high pitches, middle pitches, low
pitches, and all the rest of that old trum-
pery that has made many a noisy, stilted
reader, but never an intelligent, agreeable
one. He that understands and appreci.
ates his author will instinctively know
what tone to read him in; a knowledge
of gutturals and basilars, of pitches and
whispers, will help him not a whit. This
complicated old machinery does not,
never has, and never will make anything
but mechanical readers-readers that, in-
stead of being occupied with the thoughts
of their authors, are occupied with the
sound of their own voices, which is fatal

to the object the reader has in view
that of interesting his auditors.
Opening at random a treatise recently
published entitled “Philosophic Elocu-
tion," I find in the chapter headed
"Qualities of Voice" the following: “It
[the aspirate] is an impure quality, akin
to the guttural and whisper, coming as
it were between them, and next in at-
tenuated quality to the latter. It means,
properly, sound emitted in rough breath-
ings' or hissings, and is necessary as ex-
pressive of violent passion. It then be-
comes comparative excellence in the
interpretation of hate, aversion, fear,
anger, frenzy, horror, and the like pas-
sions. Where these rage intensely the
aspirate added to the guttural, still fur-
ther corrupting and vitiating the orotund
or fundamental voice, gives thereto that
vicious, fiendish character expressive of
dire revenge and destructiveness, which
are otherwise inexpressible. This quality

of voice may be created as follows:
Raise the tongue at the root, high
toward the palate, obstructing as much
as possible the passage ; contract and
close the GLOTTIS still more than in gut-
tural tones; make strong effort to obu.
struct the egress of air, while with strong-
est pressure of abdominal dorsal and pec-
toral muscles it is forced out through the
closed glottis and obstructed passage.
Thus, while uttering the words, there will
be an escape of air which is not converted
into speech, but, driven out with utmost
force, accompanies it with harsh and hiss-
ing sound. This is the aspirate as used
in the interpretation of the malignant
passions."
It is strange that intelligent persons
can be persuaded to believe that this
kind of “philosophy" ever has assisted
any one to become a reader! It is this
kind of philosophy that has justly brought
the professional elocutionist into great

disrepute with the members of the dra
matic profession, who will tell you that
they have never seen a student of elocu-
tion that could act, that they are always
unnatural, and consequently unsympa-
thetic, and yet the facts are :
ist. There can be no good acting with-
out good elocution.
2d. Without much study, and in the
right direction, there can be no good
elocution.
3d. There is no art that can be taught
with more success than elocution.
The actor himself becomes a student
of elocution the moment he asks himself
how a single sentence should be spoken.
Elocution teachers, as a class, undoubt-
edly do more harm than good ; their
teaching is commonly much worse than
no teaching at all, but that is not the
fault of the art.
Reading is a difficult art, far more dif-
ficult than most persons imagine. There

is no art for which a natural aptitude is
more necessary. There are many good
musicians to one good reader, and many
good judges of music to one good judge
of reading. In the reader sound and
fury are accepted, by most persons, as
art, and are applauded accordingly. I
have heard but two readers—three, if I
count Fanny Kemble—that I should be
willing to put in the very first rank.
These two were Mr. Edwin Forrest and
Miss Charlotte Cushman. There is, as
far as I know, no reader now before the
public to be compared with them. Of
course I have not heard them all, and,
then, opinions differ. Neither Mr. For-
rest nor Miss Cushman ever left anything
to chance, to inspiration, that could be
settled beforehand—not an emphasis,
not an inflection, not a pause. All was
carefully considered, and for everything
they did they had a reason.

to hear any one read Hamlet's solilo-
quy on death as Mr. Forrest read it,
than I would to see any living Amer-
ican actor play his whole repertory; and
I would walk farther and give more to
hear any one read the part of Queen
Catherine in Henry VIII. as Miss Cush-
man read it, than I would to see in her
best part an actress that should embody
all the excellencies of all the American
actresses of to-day. Mr. Forrest and
Miss Cushman were great players, and
what made them great was their won-
derful powers as readers, as elocutionists.
In all else that goes to make the actor
they have had many a peer. They were
intellectual players, scholarly players,
players that were far beyond the appre-
ciation of the great majority of those that
saw them. This lack of contemporary
appreciation was especially true of the
popular estimate of Mr. Forrest, whom
the million were inclined to think a phys-

ical rather than an intellectual actor,
Both Forrest and Cushman were close
and successful students of Nature, and
their delivery had in it none of the mere
noise and circumstance of declamation.
Their minds were ever occupied with
the thought, the sentiment and spirit of
their author, never with the tones they
employed. They knew that if they suc-
ceeded in mastering their author, the
time, the tone, the pitch, and the force
best suited to the rendering of him would
all take care of themselves. They knew
that any other course of procedure
would result in making their delivery
mechanical, automatic and soulless, in-
stead of spontaneous, realistic and im.
pressive.
But I would not be understood to in-
timate that it is necessary merely to un-
derstand an author in order to read him
well; I say only that a thorough study
of the language to be read is the first

step to be taken, and that what follows is
often comparatively easy.* But as there
is, when one is not ill, a vast difference
between being well and being well, so
there is a vast difference between com-
prehending an author and comprehend-
ing him. Most persons of any culture
think they comprehend Shakspeare, yet
there is quite as much difference in their
appreciation of him as there is in their
appreciation of, say the paintings of the
great masters. How many of the read-

Studies in articulation and pronunciation are properly

the life of a citizen, and would so empha-
size the language as to bring out this
thought? Very few, indeed, as I know
by observation. I once knew an elocu-
tionist (!) that for years had been getting
$5 an hour for teaching, and had gone
over this speech again and again without
discovering this peculiarity of the Vene-
tian law, and, of course, without making
it appear in the reading.
Elocution cannot be learned from
books, any better than painting or sculpt-
ure can. No treatise on the art, no mat-
ter how voluminous it is, can do much
more than give the learner a few hints to
set him thinking and observing. After
having carefully studied the language to
be read-supposing that its meaning is
not obvious—one should proceed to de-
termine how it should be spoken in
order to make the meaning clear :
ist. Which are the words that should
be emphasized.

2d. Which the clauses that, being
comparatively unimportant, should be
lightly touched-slurred.
3d. Where the voice should be kept
up, and where allowed to take the falling
inflection.
4th. Where the pauses should be
made, the longest of which are always
made between the thoughts.
The tone, I insist, will take care of it-
self. Herein he that knows what he is
reading about, he that appreciates his
author, will never fail.
In order to execute well, practice, as
a matter of course, is necessary, and a
great deal of practice, too. In practising
remember:
ist. To be chary of emphasis. Never
emphasize a word unless you think the
sense demands it. Emphasis being only
relative stress, over-emphasis defeats its
object. Do nothing without a reason.
Spare the ifs, the ands, and the buts.

Do not come down on them as though
you would annihilate them, after the fash-
ion of many readers. The particles should
generally be touched lightly.
2d. That in slurring parenthetic clauses
-clauses that tell how, when, where,
etc.—we make a slight pause before and
after them, and speak them somewhat
more rapidly and less forcibly than the
rest of the text. Examples:
“ Speak the speech-I pray you—as I
pronounced it to you."
“ The censure of the which one must
-in your allowance--overweigh a whole
theatre of others.”
“This book—as you see by the title
-is a pronouncing manual.”
So, too, must the particles and the
pronouns, as a rule, be touched lightly,
after the manner of good offhand speak-
ers, and of cultivated persons in conver-
sation, except when the sense requires
them to be emphatic. Giving the name

sound to the particles and pronouns
—which necessitates the distinct aspi-
ration of the h's of the pronouns, a
thing that we hear an occasional Eng-
lishman do, seemingly to make sure of
not being taken for a cockney-makes
one's utterance stilted, pedantic and self-
conscious. Herein some of our Eng-
lish actors are great offenders. There is
as much difference between the proper
sound to give to the pronouns and the
particles in speaking and reading and their
name sounds as there is between the name
sound of the and the sound we usually
give it in conversation. The primary
object of reading, of reciting, and of de-
claiming is not to make our listeners
understand the words, but to make them
comprehend the thoughts the words ex-
press. The reader that sets himself the
task of sending every syllable to the ut-
termost corners of the house is sure to
be stilted, automatic, unnatural, and con.

sequently uninteresting. If every syl.
lable reaches, so much the better, but
they must be sent without apparent
effort. Good taste limits clearness of
articulation as well as everything else.
Overdoing in articulating, as in man-
ners, is always far more objectionable
than underdoing, as nothing else is so
objectionable as self-consciousness and
affectation. An evident effort to be
fine is a distinguishing characteristic
of the underbred and the half-schooled.
3d. That great care should be taken not
to let the voice die out, as many readers
and players do, at the end of sentences
and as the breath leaves the lungs. No
other one thing is so destructive to the
sense, except the old-fashioned practice
of varying the tones in order to avoid
being monotonous-a reproach that will
never be made an intelligent reader that
is intent upon keeping his auditors occu-
pied with the thought of his author. Then

the tones will change spontaneously.
If the sentiment does not change them
let them remain unchanged. If the read-
er allows himself to be occupied with
the tones of his voice, the listener will do
likewise, and will soon become wearied.
This sing-song manner of delivery per-
vades nearly the whole German stage.
The German actor, find him where you
will, never, by any chance, speaks a sen-
tence in a natural tone, save when he
plays low-comedy parts. No one could
be more natural than he when he per-
sonates a comic tinker or a comic cob-
bler ; but when he attempts the persona-
tion of a man of the better sort his
delivery is artificial in the extreme. Nor
need .we hunt far to find, even in high
places, on our own stage those that sin
in this direction quite as grievously as
the Germans do. This is a style of
elocution that costs little labor, and
makes small demands on the intelligence,


## p. 20 (#34) ##############################################

20
THE ESSENTIALS
4th. That in endeavoring to be natu.
ral one must be careful not to degen-
erate into the commonplace. Under-
doing is always worse than overdoing.
The worst of faults is tameness. The
happy mean between the declamatory
and the commonplace is often not easy
to find. This is the reason that we so
rarely hear certain passages in popular
plays satisfactorily spoken — Hamlet's
advice to the players, for example. How
beautifully, how naturally, and yet with
what princely dignity Mr. Forrest used
to speak these speeches !
5th. To be deliberate, to take time.
But let your deliberation appear in the
time you consume with your pauses-
which, remember, when of much length,
must be between the thoughts — and
not in any drawling or dwelling on the
words, for they must come clean-cut
and sharply defined. Nothing else does
more to make one's reading natural and

OF ELOCUTION,
realistic than the proper distribution of
time. In extemporizing we pause in-
stinctively: to give the listener time to
comprehend, and to prepare our next
thought for presentation.
6th. That in speaking the language of
others we should seem to be finding the
thought and the language as we go along.
I may say here that no one, no matter
who, can do himself full justice in speak-
ing the language of another unless he
is as familiar with it as he is with his
A B C's. He must know the language
so thoroughly that it costs him no
effort whatever to recall it.
7th. Not to commit a selection to
memory until, by going over it men-
tally, you are able to read it mentally
to your satisfaction. To memorize a
selection and then study the reading
is “to put the cart before the horse.”
First decide upon the form of the utter-
ance, then, as you memorize, you will
ar

THE ESSENTIALS
memorize the form as well as the words.
Salvini is said to have studied King
Lear six years before he made any
effort to commit the part to memory.
8th. That untutored readers are al.
most certain to strike a higher key in
reading than that of their ordinary tone.
This is a fault that a little attention will,
in most cases, readily correct. An easy
way to make sure of striking a natural
tone is to preface what one is about to
read with one or two extemporaneous
sentences, and then to go directly from
one's own language to that of the au-
thor. For example, thus: If you will
listen I will read, for your edification, I
hope, some verses by Alfred Tennyson.
They are entitled “Recollections of the
Arabian Nights,” and begin by saying
that :
“ When the breeze of a joyful dawn
blew free," etc. Nothing is easier than
in this way to begin in the tone one

habitually speaks in. Then, after a little
practice, one can forego the preface.
gth. To take breath often, very often,
and to take it inaudibly. Leave gasp-
ing to " barn - stormers” and prayer-
meeting exhorters. Never speak with-
out having the lungs well filled. In
taking breath and in speaking use the
muscles of the chest as little as possible ;
make, if you can, the diaphragm and
abdominal muscles—the belly—do all
the work. Practice will make this easy,
and will immensely increase the so-
called lung power for both momentary
and continued effort. If a speaker from
nervousness loses his voice he has only
" to pull himself together," take a deep,
full breath, and speak from the abdo-
men, to find his voice instantly return
to him. In exercising the voice with
the view of strengthening it, it is not
necessary to make much sound, but
only to utter the words, or the vowels

only, with intensity. This can be done
without disturbing a neighbor in an ad-
joining room. Voice is as much the re-
sult of muscular effort as is the turning
of somersaults, and one should not ex-
pect to have the muscles with which one
produces it well hardened and under
proper control with less than at least two
years' constant practice. No other exer-
cise is more, if equally, invigorating. It
is not necessary to have much voice in
order to read well. A fragile person
with a weak voice, if it is under control,
might be very artistic; but a strong
voice and great strength are necessary in
order to be effective, especially in deal.
ing with pathos or passion.
Advanced 'pupils in schools can com-
monly be taught with considerable suc-
cess to read naturally by giving them a
selection to familiarize themselves with
-a short, simple story, for example--and

then asking them, first, to give the sub-
stance of the selection in their own lan-
guage, and afterward the selection in the
language of its author. As soon as the
pupil begins to speak (or to read) in a
high tone or unnaturally he should be
stopped, with the question : “What did
you say this is about ?” which will bring
him back to a natural tone. Then, after
he has extemporized a few sentences, he
should be directed to return to the lan-
guage of the book. One hour of this
kind of drill will accomplish more than
a whole term of wrestling with high
pitches, low pitches, basilars, gutturals,
orotunds, and sostenutos.
If these hints suffice to make the stu
dent of elocution think and observe, they
do about all that any treatise can do in the
way of making readers. He that would
acquire the art of speaking the language

natural manner should study the manner
of good extemporaneous speakers and
of people in earnest conversation. He
should observe how they emphasize-how
they slur the unimportant, reserving their
breath and strength for the important-
and how they pause. Let him study him-
self, too, as well as others, especially if his
manner is naturally earnest and animated.
Whatever is even akin to a drawling, a
whining, an intoning, or a canting manner
of speaking he cannot too studiously shun.
Natural tones are the tones of truth and
honesty, of good sense and good taste.
It is with them only that the understand-
ing is successfully addressed ; with them
only that we can arouse and keep awake
the intelligence of the listener, which
is the object we always have in view,
whether we speak our own language or
that of another.
The only serious objection, I believe,

to the course I recommend is that it
offers comparatively little opportunity
for the professor to impress his pupils,
and through them the neighborhood,
with his profundity. In natural, com-
mon-sense processes there is rarely any-
thing that dazzles, never anything that
bewilders.

I will indicate, as nearly as I am able,
what I conceive to be the proper read-
ing of Portia's great speech in the
fourth act of “The Merchant of Venice,”
giving some of the reasons for the em-
phasis. A careful study of this speech
will give the student of elocution an
idea of the course it is necessary to pur-
sue, and of the thought required in order
to determine how the more difficult
authors should be read:

over should be touched lightly.

Portia.— The quality of mercy is not strained.)
Thoughtless readers, who comprise
fully forty-nine in every fifty, are sure to
make either quality or mercy, or possibly
both emphatic, while the thoughtful read-
er sees that the making of either of these
words emphatic puts a meaning into the
line not intended. To say that “The
quality of mercy is not strained” is to
say that some other attribute of mercy
is, or may be, strained—the quantity,
for example. And to say, “The quality
of mercy is not strained” is to say that

when one is in doubt about the empha-
sis it is an excellent plan to express the
thought of the author in one's own lan-
guage, and then to transfer the emphasis
to the language of the author; and also
that when one has difficulty in speaking
the language of an author naturally, that
it is likewise a good plan to express the
thought in one's own language, and then
to transfer the intonation to the author.
In doing so, in endeavoring to be nat-
ural, colloquial, one must be very careful
not to degenerate into the commonplace
-a very common fault. Of the two it
is better to overdo than to underdo, as
in underdoing there is great danger of
being tame, which is the worst of faults.

his emphasis that it has somewhere been
said in the context that mercy is once
blest, as without this statement his
emphasis would not be justified. We
should say of a man that has been twice
imprisoned, in simply stating the fact :
“ He has been twice imprisoned;" but if
we were answering the question, “ Has
he not been imprisoned ?" we should
instinctively say: “ Yes, he has been
twice imprisoned." In emphasis, as in
grammar, it is always the sense that
determines.
It blesseth him that gives/ and him that takes :/
Strangely enough,“ him that gives and

have always seemed to me valueless.
This emphasis seems to me absurd. Por-

This is, probably, the line of the whole

better is much the most emphatic word.
They say, “All monarchs have crowns.”

“Fame is better than riches,” than it is to

and better is certainly the least emphatic.

HAMLET'S ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS.
Speak the speech (I pray you) as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. But, if you mouth it (as many
of our players do) I had as lief the town-crier had spoke
my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much-your hand
thus ; but use all gently : for, in the very torrent, tem-
pest, and (as I may say) the WHIRLWIND of passion, you
must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a
robustious, periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters,
to very rags, to split the ears of the GROUNDLINGS ; who
(for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable
dumb shows and noise. I could have such a fellow
whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod.
Pray you, avoid it.
PLAYER. I warrant your honor.
Be not too TAME, neither ; but let your own discretion
be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to
the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep
not the modesty of nature ; for anything so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first
and now, was and is, to hold (as 'twere) the mirror up to
nature : to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own
image, and the very age and body of the time his form
and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,
though it may make the unskilful laugh, cannot but
make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one
must (in your allowance) outweigh a whole theatre of
others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and
heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it
profanely), that, having neither the accent of Christians nor

That flesh is heir to—'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die—to sleep
To sleep?-perchance to dream-aye, there's the rubl
For, in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause! There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of disprized love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes-
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns-puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of !

DEPORTMENT.
A WORD, and only a word, with regard
to deportment on the rostrum or the
stage.
The first and most important thing
to do is to learn to do nothing—to keep
still, to stand firmly on the feet, without
any dropping in the hips, letting the
hands fall where the attraction of gravi-
tation will take them.
Of all the positions one can take, this
one is the most graceful, and it may
always be held until the demands of the
occasion necessitate a change. It should
never be changed simply for the sake of
change.
Yet it is the position least in favor
with the tyro. He persists in fre-
quently changing the position of his
feet, in dropping in the hips, in putting

his hands behind his back, on his hips,
or in his trousers pockets; in putting his
thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, or in his
belt, if he wears one, or in clutching his
sword-hilt, if he carries one-in short, he
persists in doing everything but the right
thing, which is, I repeat, to keep still in
the position described.
No other one thing so quickly betrays
the novice as fidgeting, and fumbling,
and trying to hide the hands; and no
other one thing does so much to make
one appear to be master of the situation,
and to make one's bearing dignified and
pleasing to the eye as—repose.

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
Of the three places where we hear
most public speaking and reading—our
courts of law, our theaters, and our
churches—the place where we hear the
best elocution is the first, and the place
where we hear the worst elocution is
the last. The reason we hear the best
elocution in our courts of law is because
there the speakers are most occupied
with the thoughts expressed by the
language they utter, because there they
are most in earnest, and because there
they address themselves most to the
intelligence. Mere sound produces its
effect on the feelings, while reason
alone reaches the intelligence.

of the first class of speakers; in Epis-
copal pulpits, the best examples of the
second.
No man's delivery can be wholly bad

worth the uttering, if he bé master

monly more effective than he that
speaks a lesson conned, or speaks from
a manuscript, simply because his mind
is more fully occupied with the thought

in the delivery of a lesson conned as
they would be if the whole—thought
and language-were their own. For
all, however, this requires much study,
and for some persons, no matter how
much study they give to the art of de-
livery, skill is impossible. Some of
our great players are probably quite as
impressive in speaking the language of
their parts as they would be if the
thought were theirs, and the language
came to them as they give it utterance.
This accomplishment they acquire by
availing themselves of the assistance of
the best masters, and by studying Na-
ture in her best forms. The most ef-
fective speaker of language this coun-
try has thus far produced, and one of
the most effective any country has ever

thing did he leave undone that he
thought would in any degree improve
his elocution. In the matter of pro-
nunciation, for example, he was one of
the most correct persons that have ever
spoken the English language. Therein
it was always safe to take him as a
guide. Nor was he less correct in those
things that it is necessary to pay atten-

author's thought. His emphasis, his
pauses, and the inflections were always
just what they should be to make his
language impressive.

No man can make language thor-
oughly effective that has not learned
how to do it; that is not studied and
practiced in the art commonly called
elocution, which The Standard Diction-
ary defines as “proper and effective oral
delivery.” One writer on the art says
that elocution may be defined as simply
“the intelligent, intelligible, correct,
and effective interpretation and ex-
pression of thought and emotion in
speech and action.” Another says:
“ It is the appropriate utterance of the
thoughts and feelings presented in
written language.” A definition I pre-
fer to either of these is this : “Elocu-

How many preachers know anything

awkward and ungainly, when, by follow-

Much importance as has been at-

class of persons, a part of whose duties
is to speak in public two or three times

comes of the fact that elocution is
thought by many to make the speaker
or reader unnatural and stilted. I
think it may be found in the fact that
many preachers are indifferent, and are
content to discharge their duties in a
simply perfunctory manner. If they
had the burning zeal of a Paul or an
Ulfilas, of a Luther or a Calvin, of a
Massilon or a Whitfield, they should do
all in their power to make their deliv-
ery effective. In the Methodist pul-
pits, for example, it is too often the
fashion to vociferate—to rant, as the
stage calls it—with all the physical
energy the speaker chances to possess.
In the Episcopal, very many go to the
other extreme. There they go so far
in avoiding the vociferation indulged
in by their Methodist neighbors that
some of them lose all semblance of
being in earnest. They go through
the entire service, sermon included, as

though they thought it quite “the
thing” to be as monotonous and auto-
matic as possible. The Methodist ap-
pears to think his auditors want and
expect what the stage calls “ginger,"
so he howls himself hoarse. The Epis-
copalian, on the contrary, appears to
think his auditors want and expect pro-
priety, alias monotony, so he gives it to
them in a tone that oftentimes is hardly
audible. Yet both Methodist and Epis-
copalian profess to have the same mis-
sion, to teach the same truths, to be
guides in the same paths. It is, or is sup-
posed to be, the mission of both to con-
vince; yet how differently do they go
about the compassing of the object in
view! And still, since there have been
men to convince, they have been con-
vinced in essentially the same way; and
as long as there are any men to convince,
they will be convinced in essentially the
same way. That way, however, is not

the way that fashion has introduced into
a great majority of the pulpits of to-day.
The speakers we find in these same
pulpits, when they are really intent on
bringing others to see as they see, are
very different in manner from the man-
ner they assume in their pulpits. Then
they talk like men. Then, they are
natural. Then, the one leaves off vo-
ciferating; the other, mumbling. Then,
they both leave off intoning. Then,
they make a direct, earnest, honest,
manly appeal to the listener.
Some speakers, I should observe,
resort to vociferation, to clatter, to
make up for a paucity of matter. He
that has thought to present that he is
really desirous to have his auditors
comprehend, instinctively avoids drown-
ing it in a sea of sound.

cause the so-called methods are nearly
all bad, and because the self-called
teachers of elocution, nineteen out of

methods. Elocution, however, can be
taught, and taught as successfully as
any other art can be taught. But, be-
ware, you that would study the art—if
there be any such-into whose hands
you get.
I have no doubt that if the reading
and speaking done in our churches
were done really well, from a purely
elocutionary point of view, the church
attendance would be well-nigh double
what it is. If you want people to go
to church you must interest them, and
you can't interest them by holloing at
them, or by mumbling at them.
The success of a speaker before the
average audience depends as much on
the manner of the delivery as on the
matter delivered.

emphasize, inflect, and pause in order
to make an author's meaning clear, we

greatest thing in elocution, as in reli-
gion, is the love of God. How love of
God or of poetry could possibly sharpen
one's wits I cannot see. I have yet to
find that the pious read any better than
the impious, nor has it ever seemed to
me that love for the poetic betters that
discretion that Shakespeare intimates
is the elocutionist's best tutor. Indeed,
I have always been under the impres-
sion that poets are commonly bad read-
ers, even of their own compositions.
Love of poetry may, usually does, make
the reader earnest, but unwhipped earn-
estness is seldom anything but fuss and
fury. Then we have “The New Elocu-
tion,” “The New Dynamic Reading,”
“The Psychological Elocution," and
perhaps some other kinds of elocution
that I have never heard of. Whether
any one of these various kinds of elo-
cution is likely to drag elocution out
of the slough of despond, in which all

matter that I have not even an impres-

a vague idea of what these various
kinds of elocution are. Philistine-like,
I have been content to stick to the old
sort, of which I have still much to
learn. No man should attempt the new
till he has mastered the old.
And then there are a good many
persons who think, it would seem, that
coming together and speaking some
pieces to one another and clapping one
another on the back and crying, Bravo,
brother! and Well done, sister! whether
the pieces are well spoken or not, will
do something, or should do something,
toward bringing elocution “into better
repute with the world.” This, per-
haps, will do the business, but I'm
skeptical; I'm afraid it won't; I don't
see how it can. On the contrary, this
sort of thing, it seems to me, is shaped

to do harm rather than good. There
is danger that it will send the tyro home
distended like the pouter-pigeon, with
a misconception of his own importance,
in which event he is more than ever in
danger of never knowing how little he
knows. Chest out and chin ahigh, he
says to himself: “Ha, ha! I read be-

come of thinking one's self a game-
cock when one is only a bantam. Com-
monly, we profit more by being made to
see our faults than by being blinded to
them. Mutual admiration societies and
air-castle building are very like in what
they yield.
That elocution is a good thing, since
it is nothing else than “proper and
effective oral delivery,” no one will

veigh against elocution when, if they
would reflect for a moment, they would
not inveigh against the art, but against
those who profess to cultivate it. The
habit prevails among actors to decry
elocution; the less they know the more
emphatic their disapproval, yet an
actor's manner of speaking, more than
all else, fixes his status in his vocation.
So far as we know, all great actors
have not only been great elocutionists,
but they were schooled in elocutionary
art by teachers of high or low degree,
from Mr. William Shakespeare, of
Stratford-on-the-Avon, to Miss Louisa
A. Fangs, of New York on the Hudson.
“And you," I imagine I hear a cho-
rus of voices ask, “have you a way to
drag elocution out of the slough in
which it wallows?" Oh, yes, I have a
way. Whether it be like Wolsey's, a
sure and safe one, I will not pretend to
say. The outcome of pursuing my

way would depend much upon the in-
telligence employed in the pursuit.
It has ever seemed to me that elocu-
tion spreads out enormously in a di-
rection whose domain the average elo-
cutionist never deems it worth his while
to explore, much less to cultivate. With
few exceptions, so far as I have been
able to judge, the now-a-day elocution-
ists look upon elocution as being little
more than a near kin to gymnastics.
They begin, continue and end with the
brawn side of the art, and demean
themselves, from first to last, as though
having got the voice-making machine
in good condition and well under con-
trol; as though, having possessed them-
selves of the power successfully to fire
sound at words, they have done all
there is to do to be an accomplished
elocutionist. That elocution is an emi-

side is as one to many—is something
the elocutionists make haste to say
they know, while their doing says they
know it not.
That elocution is a highly intellect-
ual, and, consequently, a very difficult
art, we have evidence that amounts to
proof in the fact that, so far as is gen-
erally known, America has produced
only two readers of the first class. If
this be true, as both these readers have
been more than twenty years dead, it
might be questioned whether or not
the great majority of the present gen-
eration of elocutionists have had an op-
portunity to learn what good reading
is. Really good reading, I am sure,
would be a revelation to the majority
of the more intelligent of them; the
less intelligent would, perchance, re-
mind us of the Mohawk that preferred
a colored lithograph to a picture by
Rubens.

THE ESSENTIALS
To those elocutionists who contend
that a course in muscle training, in
voice-culture, must precede every other
step in acquiring the elocutionary art;
that it is useless to try to learn to read
until one has trained the voice-to such
elocutionists the field that the real elo-
cutionist begins, continues, and ends
with, is an unknown realm. The verit-
able elocutionist, the elocutionist that
recognizes the importance of cultivating
the intellectual side of his art, in his
teaching, gives little time to voice-cul-
ture, and that little he gives grudg-
ingly. He knows that if his pupil is
in earnest, a few simple hints, a direct-
ing word now and then will suffice to
enable him, little by little, to strengthen
the voice-making apparatus and get it
under control. He feels, he knows,
that to take a pupil's time in putting
him through a course of voice exercises
is to receive without making an equit-

able return. He knows that the pupil
can exercise and develop the voice-
making muscles perfectly well without
his immediate aid. Teachers that spend
time in vocal culture are of the sort
that contrive to make as many bites of
the cherry as possible; that are ever in-
tent on making the little they know goas
far as they can ; that are always studying
to make the simple appear complex.
The few things a reader has to do, in
order to read well, offer difficulties so
great that none ever attain to excel-
lence but those who supplement natural
aptitude with long and careful study.
I would not be understood to intimate
that the gymnastic elocutionists are
dishonest. To censure them for not
knowing what they never have had an
opportunity to learn, or even to know
the existence of, obviously would be
unfair. Few of us ever see anything
that is not pointed out to us. The

fact, however, is still a fact, that the
brawn side of elocution is to the brain
side as a pond is to the Pacific. Mas-
tery of the gymnastic side is within the
easy reach of all.
Cultivating the voice, moreover, after
the fashion of the tonists is a danger-
ous thing to do. If cultivated after
their fashion, it seldom, if ever, fails to
lead to artificiality. Cultivating special
tones for this sentiment and for that
sentiment, for this passion and for that
passion, is fatal. The Murdock school
of elocution has done infinite harm.
The late Mr. Murdock was not a read
er; he was a chanter. Keeping track
of the thought in the tones of a sing-
songer is bothersome. It is always
safe to be direct and honest, subtle Iago
to the contrary notwithstanding. The
reader that thinks of the tones he makes
quickly becomes tiresome.
As we can very well judge of the

grade of a man's culture by noting
what he laughs at, so we can very well
judge what an elocutionist knows of
the art he professes to cultivate by no-
ting what he applauds. At the first
meeting of the National Association of
Elocutionists, in 1892, a young woman
read a selection from Shakespeare, and,
as I thought, read badly. To my think-
ing, there was but one thing in her
reading to commend-earnestness-
but the earnestness, being unschooled,
was but little less than fuss and fury.
Yet the two or three hundred experts
there assembled applauded rapturously.
Had the young woman read well, artist-
ically, naturally, the fury and fuss would
have been absent. Would the applause
of the experts have been equally rap-
turous ? I doubt it, and I doubt it be-
cause I noted what, at that convention,
seemed most to please. Soon after the
Shakespeare reading, a young woman

it with much intelligence. She seemed
simply to have set herself the task of
letting her auditors know what it was
about, and this she did successfully.
Her methods were direct and natural,
without any apparent effort to be effect-
ive. I heard no one at the convention
that pleased me more; but the im-
pression she made on me was very
different from the impression she seem-
ed to make on her auditors generally,
for they applauded in the most per-
functory manner, and did not call for
an encore, as was their habit. Though
the young woman was unknown to me
I sought her out and said what I could
to console her. I have no doubt there
were others in the audience-half-a-
dozen, perhaps—that thought of the
two readings essentially as I did, but
the few counted for little among the
many. On another occasion, at a re-

ception attended largely, if not wholly,
by elocutionists, a young woman read
a selection from Shakespeare, and read
exceptionally well. Her effort was
damned with faint applause; it was
plain that she had fired too high for
her audience. The next number on
the programme chanced to be a young
woman from the West, who gave them
a broadly humorous character sketch.
This, though scarcely within the prov-
ince of elocutionary art, the audience
applauded till the windows rattled.
All of which goes to show that our
elocutionists, taken as we find them, do
not know good reading from bad. Nor
will they ever know good reading from
bad until, instead of giving nine parts
of their attention to the brawn side
of elocution and one part to the brain
side, they give nine parts of their at-
tention to the brain side and one part
to the brawn side. Indeed, if they will

the brawn side will well-nigh take care
of itself. Then we shall have elocution

are elocutionists; then, and not till
then, will elocution stand with the stage
and with the world as it deserves to

All that is necessary in order to
read well, is to speak naturally, but
naturalness of all things is the most
difficult thing to attain. Any one that
can draw at all can draw something
that would be readily recognized as an
attempt to draw the human figure, but
to draw the human figure so that it is
true to Nature one must be a superb
artist.
The most difficult thing to learn in
reading is properly to distribute the
time, to be deliberate, to pause fre-
quently and naturally. The accom-
plished reader always takes plenty of
time. He that does not, he that has-
tens, never seems to be master of the

situation, to have his task well in hand,
and consequently he never is as effec-
tive as he might be. Nor must this
deliberation appear in anything but in
the frequency and in the length of the
pauses. It must never appear in any
drawling or dwelling on the words ;
they must always come clean-cut and
sharply defined. Pausing properly does
more than any other one thing to make
one's reading natural and realistic. In
extemporizing we pause instinctively
to give the listener time to compre-
hend, and to prepare our next thought
for presentation.
The most accomplished and pains-
taking reader does not pause always
in the same places, but the variation in
the places where he pauses, and takes
breath, is inconsiderable. Pausing at
just such places is not always so
imperative as is the putting of the
emphasis on certain words; yet the

pausing cannot vary much without
materially affecting the delivery, and
the points indicated by experts for
making the pauses would not differ
greatly. It occasionally-not infre-
quently, perhaps — occurs that the
reader pauses simply to take breath,
when so far as the sense is concerned
it is a matter of indifference whether a
pause is made or not. If, however,
the breath is well managed, this will
occur very rarely. Breathing places,
i. e. places where the sense demands a
pause, are usually abundant. The un-
skilled reader commonly runs over a
large percentage of them. In the in-
terest of force and staying power, the
reader should avail himself of every
opportunity the construction affords to
breathe. Sometimes he should breathe
between every word. For example:
“ Bloody, bawdy villain ! Remorseless,
treacherous, lecherous, kindless vil-

lain!” He should take breath five
times in speaking these eight words.
Nor is it simply necessary to take
breath; the breathing should be full
and deep. There is always plenty of
time, if the reader knows how to use it.
Pausing never makes a reader monoton-
ous and tiresome; but dragging out
the words always does.
Being mindful of the fact that an
ounce of example is worth a pound of
theory, I submit two or three speeches
from Shakespeare with the pauses, at
the least, approximately indicated.
Pauses made with discretion vary, of
course, very much in length; some are
only momentary, while others may be
measured by seconds.

pauses are as necessary as are any to
be found in any passage I can at the

STUDIES IN EMPHASIS.
To learn to read well is the business of half a life.
-MACAULAY.
One of the chief things to be at-
tended to in reading is to give to the
individual words the relative import-
ance requisite to make the thought
easy to seize by the listener. He that
reads well trips lightly over a large
majority of the words. When we in
any way give prominence to a word in
the utterance we are said to emphasize
it. To be convinced that emphasizing
properly is important, we have only to
reflect that a change of emphasis often
changes the meaning of a sentence, or
suggests a thought in the context that
is not there, If we read :
It becomes
The thronèd monarch better than his crown,

we suggest the thought that the con-
text says that “ it becomes the throned
monarch as well as his crown." The
sense determined, there cannot be two
equally good ways to read. Indeed,
the sense determined, there is never
but one best way to read, and this best
way it is always the reader's duty to
find, if he can.
The importance of emphasizing pro-
perly can hardly be overestimated.
Professor S. H. Clark, in speaking of
the importance of being right in em-
phasizing, says : “One's emphasis is
the gauge of one's ability to under-
stand. Whatever else a man may be,
he is not a reader if he fails to empha-
size correctly. One who emphasizes
correctly is more than likely to do jus-
tice to his author in other regards.
Nothing else betrays our ignorance of
the text like bad emphasis. Emphasis
means judgment and the judgment that

guides one to discreet and illuminative
emphasis is more than likely to lead
one to a proper emotional rendering."
In a book recently published, entitled
“ The Art of Reading and Speaking,"
by Canon Fleming, Chaplain-in-Ordin-
ary to Queen Victoria, there are some
forty pages given up to selections from
Shakespeare and Milton with those
words italicized that, in the author's
judgment, should, in the reading, be
emphasized. There are often words
emphasized that I should not empha-
size, and sometimes there are words
un-emphasized that I should empha-
size.
It is not probable that the Canon's
reading would differ as much from
mine as his marking differs from inine.
It is often hard to decide, in marking
emphasis, whether to italicize a word
or not. In such cases, I usually leave
the word unitalicized, lest the italicizing

prove misleading. Over-emphasis is
something the reader should be careful
to avoid, as over-emphasis may easily
be carried so far as to bar the effect of
the emphases that are properly placed.
Though neither the Canon nor I may
be right, yet the study of our marking
must tend to make the student of the
art of reading more painstaking than
he otherwise might be.
There are few persons—even on the
stage, in the pulpit, or on the rostrum-
that have any apprehension of the field
that the art of reading offers for the
exercise of the intelligence. The art
of delivery, of reading, of elocution-
call it what you will-affords a field for
the display of as much perception as
does any one of the other arts. In
proof thereof, we have the fact that
there are fewer persons that excel in
reading than there are that excel in
painting or sculpture, not to mention

all the arts, if we consider only the
making of sweet sounds.
Here are some of the lines in the
Canon's book with the changes I would
suggest in the marking of them :

2. Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned;
3. Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from
hell,
4. Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
5. Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,

the speech above have been defended
thus :
In summing up Mr. Ayres says of the seventh line
of the speech beginning “ Angels and ministers of
grace,” etc., “Why emphasize me? There is no
question of the Ghost's answering anyone else."
According to the play there is a very decided ques-
tion of the Ghost answering some one else. The
Ghost first appears twice to Bernardo and Marcellus
-they communicate this to Horatio, and upon the
occasion of his watch he attempts to speak to the
Ghost. Horatio determines to inform Hamlet, for
“this spirit dumb to us will speak to him.”
Now when Hamlet is acquainted with the facts of
the Ghost's visitations he determines to watch and
speak to it though it “blast me.”
I should think that Canon Fleming's reading was
beautifully correct, because it takes notice of a very
trifling detail in the speech, and it rather surprises
me that Mr. Ayres should have failed to grasp it.
On that little word me, properly emphasized, hangs
a great deal of the pathos and power of Hamlet's
appeal. In that one word is all this meaning : You
have thrice appeared to these soldiers, and once even
Horatio had courage to address you, but answer you
make not-now it is I, Hamlet, your son, who speaks
to you, my father's spirit. “Hamlet, King, Father,
Royal Dane! O answer me."
Again, in the nineteenth line, Mr. Ayres says
“I should not italicize why, this, in 'Say, why is
this!'"

Hamlet makes several distinct interrogations and
he sums up:
Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
Canon Fleming's reading is most correct, because
by a proper emphasis of why and this, the full force
of the questions asked is made sufficiently impressive.
Whereas, if Hamlet had but asked one question,
then it seems to me it would have been incorrect to
italicize why and this.
To be sure, the best authorities will always dis-
pute many things in Shakespeare, more especially
as to the correct reading of certain passages, but,
after all, there can be only one that is really correct.
My reply is :
Mr. Markley's plea for the emphases
that he defends is, I think, as strong as
it would be possible for anyone to
make; yet it is not strong enough to
make me, “on second thought,” look
upon Canon Fleming's emphasis in the
two instances that Mr. Markley defends
as being acceptable.
Canon Fleming and Mr. Markley
contend for, “O, answer me" and
“why is this?” I contend for, “O,
answer me” and “Why is this?”

The least of my reasons for not em-
phasizing me—which, if emphasized at
all, must be made much more emphatic
than answer is because the vowel of
me is the most difficult of all the vowels
to make emphatic. This is a consider-
ation that counts for something with the
reader. Another reason—which is of
somewhat more importance- lies in the
fact that far-fetched emphases are al-
ways objectionable; they are likely to
divert the auditor's attentions from the
matter immediately in hand—a thing
that the player, the reader, and the
speaker should always study to avoid.
But these are reasons of comparatively
little weight; the chief reason, the rea-
son that far outweighs all others for
my objecting to Canon Fleming's read-
ing lies in the fact that the learned
Canon's reading does not express
Hamlet's thought; does not say what
Hamlet wants to say, which is this : Do

not persist in remaining silent. Dis-
close, make known, what your mission
is. Do not let me burst in ignorance,
but tell me why you go stalking about
when you should lie quietly inurned in
your goodly marbled sepulchre. The
whole speech shows clearly : ay, most
emphatically, that Hamlet's whole be-
ing is possessed with the desire to be
answered and not that he, being the
Ghost's son, has claims to consideration
that his comrades have not. The
thought the Canon's reading expresses
has the great demerit of being signally
belittling.
As for the other reading—why is this
—it has not, to my thinking, a peg to
stand on. Hamlet asks: What means
this, what imports, what signifies this,
why is this—your going about thus, by
the "glimpses of the moon, making
night hideous." O, answer me !

You speak the things you should speak, but you
speak them not in the manner they should be
spoken.-PLUTARCH.
The more I study Canon Fleming's
marking, the more am I inclined to
think that his reading is of the stilted,
ponderous sort that tries to get an effect
out of every word. Here is a speech
of Cassius' (Julius Cæsar, Act I., Sc.
2) in which the learned Canon italicizes
double the number of words that, in
my judgment, should be emphasized.
Take, for example, the line:
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
Read as here indicated, the utterance is,
it seems to me, most monotonous and
non-natural, having none of the spirit
in it that pervades the entire speech.
This is an easy sort of reading. Any
one can pound over words in a trip-
hammer sort of way, whereas to go

lightly over the unimportant and to
dwell on the important words with that
appreciative discrimination that makes
the thought clear and forcible; that
causes the listener to be occupied with
the matter rather than with the manner,
is never an easy thing to do. The
thought, and not the sound, is what
enlists and holds the attention of the
listener. In the thought there is never
any sameness, whereas tones continu-
ally recur, hence they quickly pall.
The time consumed by the two styles
differs but little, but they distribute the
time very differently. The one is the
style of the brawn elocutionist, the
other of the brain elocutionist; the one,
of the reader that merely apprehends
his author; the other, of the reader that
fully comprehends his author. If we
read the line I have quoted as it is
italicized above, and then read it thus:
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar,

we quickly see, or I greatly err, that by
going lightly over three of the words
our English author emphasizes, the ren-
dering of the line gains immensely in
effect as well as in animation.
Here is the entire speech as the
learned Canon marks it:
1. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
2. Like a Colossus; and we petty men
3. Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
4. To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
5. Men at sometime are masters of their fates :
6. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
7. But in ourselves that we are underlings
8. Brutus and Cæsar! what should be in that Cæsar ?
9. Why should that name be sounded more than yours
10. Write them together, yours is as fair a name ;
II. Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
12. Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with them
13. Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
14. Now in the names of all the gods at once
15. Upon what meat does this our Cæsar feed
16. That he is grown so great ? Age, thou art shamed;
17. Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods.

24. Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say,

27. As easily as a king !
In these twenty-seven lines one hun-
dred and four words are marked for
emphasis, fifty more than I should
mark. In the first line I should not
mark bestride, narrow, or world; nor in
the second line we men ; fifth line, mas-

On the other hand, in the third line, I
should mark for emphasis the word
about, as I think it should be made quite
as emphatic as the preceding word. I
should also mark feed in the fifteenth
line for emphasis, and king in the last
line.
Any one desirous to compare the
two readings would do well to copy the
speech and mark it as I suggest, or to
mark it in the printed page.

scene—the first of the third act of
“ The Merchant of Venice":
SHYLOCK.—How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa ?
Hast thou found my daughter ?
At the utmost, I should italicize only
the words now, Genoa, and daugh-
ter. The utterance the Canon, if I
understand him, recommends is monot-
onous and non-natural.
TUBAL.-I often came where I did hear of her ; but
cannot find her.
Why emphasize came, did or cannot?
I fail to see any reason for it. Hear
and find are the only words that should
be made specially to stand out.
SHYLOCK.-Why, there, there, there! A diamond
gone-cost me two thousand ducats at Frankfort. The
curse never fell upon our nation till now. I never felt
it till now.
I should not italicize nation till.
Though it is Shakespeare, the diction,
I venture to intimate, is bettered by
transposing the words of the next sen-
tence, thus: Till now, I never felt it.


## p. 97 (#111) #############################################

This transposition, if I do not err, en-
ables the reader to make the sentence
more effective, for the reason that it
puts the most emphatic word near the
end. No one is invulnerable—no, not
even Shakespeare. It is questionable
whether I never should be italicized; I
am inclined to think not.
Two thousand ducats in that; and other precious,
precious jewels !
Neither ducats nor jewels seem to me
to be emphatic.
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the
jewels in her ear. Would she were hearsed at my foot
and the ducats in her coffin.
There are only four words here that
I should mark for emphasis, the first
foot, ear, hearsed, and coffin. Passion
is commonly rapid. Rapidity would be
impossible if the reader tarried on all
the words our author italicizes.
No news of them! Why so; and I know not what's
spent in the search. Why, thou loss upon loss !

THE ESSENTIALS
The first sentence being little else
than a wail, an exclamation—a question
it is not-I should make as much of no
as of news. Why so I should treat in
like manner. I should also emphasize
the second loss. Know not and spent
I should not emphasize.
The thief gone with so much and so much to find the
thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck
stirring but what lights o' my shoulders ; no sights but
o'my breathing; no tears but o' my shedding!
Nine of the twenty-four words here
marked for emphasis I should not em-
phasize. In the clause:“And so much to
find the thief,” I should emphasize only
one word-find. To read it according
to the Canon's marking would be to
drown it in a sea of sound—a thing that
any fellow having a good voice-making
apparatus, can do, whether he have any
brains or not. I should not emphasize
the second so much, the second thief,
the second no, no ill luck, nor the two
succeeding no's.

TUBAL.— Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio,
as I heard in Genoa-
I should not emphasize yes or ill-

SHYLOCK.- What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck ?
TUBAL.-Hath an argosy cast away, coming from
Tripolis.
Argosy and Tripolis seem to me to
be the only words that should be made
at all prominent.
SHYLOCK.—I thank God; I thank God. Is it true?
Is it true?
TUBAL.—I spoke with some of the sailors that 'scaped
the wreck.
I should, at the most, mark sailors
and wreck for emphasis.
ShylocK.- I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news,
good news. Ha, ha! Where? in Genoa ?
The only possible reason that I can
see for emphasizing the first good is in-
sufficient. News, both times, and Ge-
noa should be made quite as emphatic
as any other words in the speech.
TUBAL.—Your daughter spent, in Genoa, as I heard,
one night, fourscore ducats.

I should expend neither time nor
stress on spent, nor should I heed the

SHYLOCK.—Thou stick'st a dagger in me. I shall
never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting!
Fourscore ducats !
Stick’st should surely not be empha-
sized. I have always read: “Fourscore
ducats—at a sitting ?” having Tubal
nod in answer to the question. The
clause is commonly treated as an ex-
clamation. My treatment, I think,
makes the clause much more effective.
TUBAL.—There came divers of Antonio's creditors in
my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but
break.
At the most, I should mark for em-
phasis creditors, swear, and break.
SHYLOCK.-I am very glad of it. I'll plague him;
I'll torture him ; I'm glad of it.

sentence without it than with it. Were
I to speak the very, I should touch the
glad comparatively lightly.
Tubal.-One of them showed me a ring that he
had of your daughter for a monkey.
What a heartless little wretch Jessica
is-swap a ring that was a present from
her mother to her father for a monkey!
SHYLOCK.-Out upon her ! Thou torturest me,
Tubal. It was my torquoise. I had it of Leah when
I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys.
It not being necessary, in order to
make the thought clear, to emphasize
given it is bad technique to make much
of it. The skillful reader would touch
it lightly in order that wilderness might
be made to stand out the more boldly;
then he would pause long enough after
it to take a deep, full breath which he
would expend in a burst on wilderness,
thereby ending one of the best short

TUBAL.-But Antonio is certainly undone.
SHYLOCK.-Nay that's true, that's very true. Go,
Tubal, fee me an officer ; bespeak him a fortnight before.
I will have the heart of him if he forfeit ; for were he
out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I will.
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue ; go, good
Tubal; at our Synagogue, Tubal.
I should read : “ That's very true,"
and “bespeak him a fortnight before."
As for if, I defy all the bellowcution-
ists in Christendom to find a reason
worth a blade of grass for emphasizing
it. Not once in a hundred times when
we hear this little word mauled is there
any reason for treating it other than
with the greatest delicacy. Neither
merchandise, meet, nor good should I
emphasize, unless I paused after me to
decide upon the place of meeting-
which I always do—then, I should
dwell on meet. If this treatment was
intended by our author, he should have
put a dash after me.

IV.
“ If little labor, little are our gains ;
Man's fortunes are according to his pains."
Canon Fleming has given more
space in his book to “ The Merchant of
Venice” than to any other of the Shake-
speare plays. He begins his marking
of the fourth act for emphasis with the
Duke's speech, which he treats thus:
1. Make room and let him stand before our face.
2. Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so, too,
3. That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
4. To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought,
5. Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
6. Than is thy strange apparent cruelty ;
7. And where thou now exact st the penalty-
8. Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh- .
9. Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
10. But, touched with human gentleness and love
II. Forgive a moiety of the principal;
12. Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
13. That have, of late, so huddled on his back
14. Enough to press a royal merchant down
15. And pluck commiseration of his state
16. From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
17. From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained

18. To offices of tender courtesy,
19. We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Why emphasize stand ? It's not a
question whether the Jew stand or sit ;
it's a question of the place where he
stand.
In the second line, the only emphatic
words are world, I, and too.
The third line I should leave un-
marked. There is no word in the line
that in the reading should be made
specially salient.
In the fourth line, I should make
hour quite as emphatic as the other
emphatic words. Act, possibly, should
be slightly more emphatic than the
other words. The reasons, however,
would occupy too much space.
In the fifth line, more should be
touched quite lightly. The thought-
less reader never fails to dwell on it;
not because he has a reason for doing
so, but because he unconsciously yields

to the beguiling influence of the long
0, the most sonorous vowel in the lan-
guage.
The wisdom of marking loose in the
ninth line is questionable. If at all
emphatic, it is only slightly so. The
marking is misleading.
The tenth line, read as the Canon
marks it, could, it seems to me, not be
other than very“ preachy.” It sounds
to my mind's ear, as I look at it, like
the delivery of those that, instinctively,
endeavor to make up in clatter what
they lack in matter. It smacks of the
sound-and-fury sort of elocution. The
words touched and human should not
be made at all emphatic. The empha-
sizing of the two words is utterly inde-
fensible.
The emphasizing of forgive in the
eleventh line is quite natural, and con-
sequently proper, provided the reader
employ a persuasive tone; if, however,

the tone be strictly judicial, the word
should come in for no emphasis.
In the thirteenth line, I should dwell
on so, making it, possibly, more em-
phatic than huddled.
There is only one emphatic word in
the fourteenth line-royal.
The emphasis on pluck in the fif-
teenth line is probably a misprint.
The three following lines I should
read essentially thus :
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained
To offices of tender courtesy.
There is no question of the kind of
Turks, or Tartars, or of courtesy,
hence the adjectives should not be em-
phasized. Take the adjectives out and
the language loses none of its force. I
think I shall not be alone of the opin-
ion that the learned Canon's reading is
sometimes rather ill-digested.
The nineteenth line is sometimes

without any emphasis on answer. Both
readings are defensible. I prefer the
reading that emphasizes answer.
Proficiency in the art of elocution, as well as in the
other arts, is the work of time and labor.-BRONSON.
Canon Fleming continues to indicate
the emphasis he thinks will most clear-
ly bring out the thought in the fourth
act of “ The Merchant of Venice" by
marking the lines thus:
1. I have possessed your Grace of what I purpose ;
2. And by our holy sabbath have I sworn
3. To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
4. If you deny it, let the danger light
5. Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
6. You'll ask me why I rather choose to have
7. A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive
8. Three thousand ducats ; I'll not answer that;
9. But say it is my humor. Is it answered ?
10. What if my house be troubled with a rat
II. And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
12. To have it baned ? What-are you answered yet ?
13. Some men there are love not a gaping pig ;

18. Why he a harmless, necessary cat.
19. So can I give no reason, nor will I not,
20. More than a lodged hate, and a certain loathing
21. I bear Antonio that I follow thus
22. A losing suit against him. Are you answered ?
To my thinking, have in the third
line should be touched quite lightly. I
can imagine a reader going over the
line-as many would—with an ele-
phantine tread, making much of have ;
but such readers are not the sort of
readers that take Nature as their mod-
el. They are of the sort of readers
that—unwittingly, perhaps—seek to get
their effects out of the sound of their
voices rather than out of the thoughts
of their author. Such reading is utter-
ly wanting in movement, snap, action,
earnestness; in short, it utterly lacks
the natural. It is an easy sort of read-
ing ; easy because it does not tax the

intelligence. Many persons of high
intelligence read in this manner from
habit. It has never occurred to them
that there is any other way to read;
that if the thoughts were theirs, and
the language came to them as they
give it utterance they would speak it in
an entirely different manner. If such
readers chance upon any one whose
utterance is true to Nature-particular-
ly if they hear something read that they
themselves read—the effect on them,
not infrequently, is startling; the ex-
ceeding difference in treatment is a
revelation to them.
True, danger in the fourth line, city's
in the fifth, ask in the sixth, and weight
in the seventh properly get a little
stress, but they, properly, get so little
stress compared with the more emphat-
ic words that, in my judgment, it is
misleading to mark them. I don't see
how a reader could fail to give them

all the prominence they demand. The
other words italicized should be spoken
with all the unction the reader is mas-
ter of.
Not, that and say in the eighth and
ninth lines are absolutely unemphatic.
Read as marked, how ponderous the
second clause of the eighth line is! A
great effect may be produced with hu-
mor, but not if the reader tarries on
the word say.
In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
lincs, there are only five emphatic
words—rat, ten, baned, what, and yet.
All the other words should be spoken
rapidly. After rat, and before and
after ten, the reader should pause quite
as long as he would after what in the
twelfth line.
The learned Canon's marking of the
thirteenth line is peculiar. According
to his reading, there are men that,
though they love not gaping pigs, they

do love pigs that do not gap. Neither
love nor not is emphatic, while pig is
slightly the most emphatic word in the
line.
While I should not emphasize ren-
dered in the sixteenth line, I should
emphasize reason very strongly. The
defense of the emphasis on no firm is
easily seen, but to my thinking, it is
hardly worth considering. Indeed,
these two words are but slightly em-
phatic.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth
lines, I should emphasize pig and cat
very strongly, and should not empha-
size abide.
In the nineteenth line, I should em-
phasize neither so nor no.
I always make two syllables of lodged,
as to my ear it betters the rhythm. It
is always printed, I believe, as one syl-
lable. The fact that if two syllables
be made of the word the line has a syl-

Rhythm, smoothness, is the thing that
is important.
To my seeing, there is not one em-
phatic word in the twenty-first line,
and only two in the twenty-second-
losing and answered.
If these discussions are studied, they
will not fail, I think, to interest and
benefit many; but, if they are only
read, they will, I fear, neither interest
nor benefit anyone.

“The student of the art of delivery never finishes,
there is always something left for him to learn."
Canon Fleming proceeds to mark the
emphatic words in the fourth act of
“ The Merchant of Venice" as follows:

to excuse the current of thy cruelty.
I should not emphasize no, but I

should emphasize man quite as strongly
as the adjective un feeling. The two
words are equivalent to one single
word-wretch or monster, for example
—and consequently should be made
about equally emphatic. In such
cases, the last word always gets
slightly the most stress. If the locu-
tion be such that the words may be
transposed without affecting the sense,
it will be found that the word placed
last will always be slightly the most em-
phatic. Here is an example: “It
seems that a law had been recently
made that a tax on old bachelors' pates
should be laid.” Now, transpose the
three italicized words as we will the
pates of old bachelors, the pates of
bachelors that are old—and we see
that it is always the last word that is
naturally somewhat the most emphatic.
Shylock.-I am not bound to please thee with my
answer.

THE ESSENTIALS
Our author marks no word in this
speech for emphasis. I have always
emphasized thee very strongly, and
this, possibly, will be considered by

I am inclined to think, is more than
doubtful. Should I ever play the
scene again, I think I shall adopt the
Canon’s reading, speaking the speech
in a sneering rather than in an angry
tone. Treated in this manner, I
should not be surprised to see the
speech gain in effectiveness.
BASSANIO.—Do all men kill the things they do not
love ?
Were there any question of the

on not would be correct, but not other-
wise.

size, but I should emphasize would
very strongly. The thought is : Does
any man hate a thing he would not
like to kill, and this thought is very
clearly brought out by emphasizing
would. The two last words should be
touched very lightly.
BASSANIO.-Every offence is not a hate at first.
SHYLOCK.- What! would'st thou have a serpent
sting thee twice ?
This reading is bettered, I think, by
touching sting lightly.
ANTONIO.- I pray you, think, you question with a
Jew.
The comma after think is the Can-
on's. This reading seems to me utter-
ly bad; it has, so far as I can see,
neither rhyme nor reason to defend it.
Jew is surely the word to emphasize.
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;

question, and in the second line the
only words I should emphasize are ewe
and lamb.
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise.
Were I to mark these two lines for

BASSANIO—For thy three thousand ducats here are
six.
SHYLOCK.-If ev'ry ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
If Shylock were asked if he would
accept, then he would properly, natu-
rally, emphasize the negative, but not
otherwise. Draw, I take it, is the em-
phatic word.

"The most offensive thing we encounter on the stage
is a big voice with little intelligence behind it."
Our English reader continues his
marking of the emphatic words in the
fourth act of “The Merchant of Ven-
ice” thus:
DUKE.—How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring
none ?”
If the thought is : How can you ex-
pect any mercy, since you render no

SHYLOCK.—What judgment shall I dread, doing no
wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them,
Neither you nor use should I em-
phasize ; but parts I should emphasize
quite as strongly as any other word in
the sentence.
Shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs,
Why sweat they under burdens ?
This reading of the first clause seems
to me to be “ clean out of the way."
Never have I erred more, or say is the

marry. The offensive lies not in the
marrying, but in the thought of marry-
ing the slaves to the owners' children.
Let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates
Be seasoned with such viands ?
Neither made nor seasoned nor such
should, so far as I can see, be made
the least emphatic. The first their I
should emphasize as strongly as beds,
nor should I treat the second their as
an unemphatic word. It stands in
contradistinction to your understood ;
this we clearly see, if we supply the
ellipses.
You will answer,
The slaves are ours. So do I answer you.
Why emphasize you? There is no
suggestion that an answer shall, or

non-intelligent style of reading that is
very prevalent. The art in it is on a

Is dearly bought ; 'tis mine, and I will have it.
I should not pause an instant on de-
mand, nor do I emphasize will, though
this is the usual, and I believe the
traditional, reading. To me, this treat-
ment smacks too strongly of the bark-
ing-dog style. Veritable resolve does
not waste its strength in loud talk.
If you deny me, fie upon your law !
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

In these three lines the learned
Canon and I would have been of one

crees.

is no question of anybody's else power,
hence why emphasize my? If there is
anything to emphasize in the second
line it surely is not unless and learned;
it is rather Bellario and doctor. I
should not emphasize sent. Its posi-
tion in the line brings to it a little
more breath than the other words get,
determine excepted, but it cannot be
said to be emphatic.
SALARINO.—My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the Doctor,
New come from Padua.
The most emphatic, or rather the
only emphatic, word in the first line is
without. This, I think, clearly appears
if we transpose the words thus :
Without, my Lord, there stays a messenger.

The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
All readers, I think, emphasize what.
It's not being italicized here is prob-

ANTONIO.-I am a tainted wether of the flock
Meetest for death ; the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me.
You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,
Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.
Antonio has no thought here of in-
stituting a comparison between him-
self and anyone else. There is no
such thought, for example, as I am the
sickly wether of the flock; you are
the healthy wether of the flock, hence
he would not emphasize the qualifying

speech, I should either not mark any
word for emphasis, or I should mark,
in addition to the words our author
marks, the words wether, fruit, and
ground. In neither case should I mark
the first word, which, together with
am, should be tripped over lightly. Epi-
taph rather than write is the emphatic
word. The line means, live on and
epitaph me. If Antonio knew that
Bassanio had already composed his
epitaph, he would probably emphasize
write, not otherwise.

One's emphasis is the gauge of one's ability to un-
derstand. Nothing else betrays our ignorance of
the text like misplaced emphasis. One who empha-
sizes correctly is more than likely to do justice to
his author in other regards. The acumen that
guides to a discreet and illuminative emphasis is
more than likely to lead to a proper emotional ren-
dering.-S. H. Clark.
Canon Fleming goes from where we
left him directly to Portia's entrance.
He takes an occasional liberty with
the text that I fail to see any reason
for. I follow him, however, as he pro-
ceeds, thus:
DUKE.—Give me your hand. You come from
learn'd Bellario?
Portia.- I do, my Lord.
DUKE.—You are welcome; take your place.
Are you acquainted with the cause in question ?
Marked or unmarked, no one could
fail to read the first speech correctly ;
but why change old to learned, and
why mark the adjective for emphasis ?

If “cause in question "_which it will
be observed is not Shakespeare-
means cause of this action, litigation or
suit, then it would seem that cause, and
not question, is the emphatic word.
Portia.—I am informed throughly of the cause;
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew ?
Of these seven italicized words, I
should emphasize only three-through-
ly, merchant, and Jew.
DUKE.–Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
Portia.—Is your name Shylock ?
SHYLOCK.-Shylock is my name.
Portia.— You stand within his danger, do you not ?
Emphasize within or the second
you ! ? I fail to see why.
Antonio.-Ay, so he says.
Portia.-Do you confess the bond ? :
ANTONIO.—I do.
So is unemphatic, as we see if we
transpose the words, thus: He says so.
Portia.—Then must the Jew be merciful.
The context might make this the

proper reading; but it doesn't. As
the Jew has not already been impor-
tuned, so far as Portia knows, the
proper reading emphasizes Jew and
merciful. The thought Portia would
express is simply this : Since you ac-
knowledge the bond, there is nothing
left for you but to throw yourself on
the mercy of the Jew.
ShylocK.-On what compulsion must 1? Tell me
that.
I would not quarrel with this mark-
ing, though I should have left tell un-
italicized. The emphasis on must is
not necessary to bring out the sense,
but, by emphasizing it, Shylock may, if
he treats it properly, very forcibly give
utterance to the feeling aroused with-
in him by the suggestion that he shall
be merciful. Such cases as this are
rarely met with. The naked thought
nearly always determines.
Portia.—The quality of mercy is not strained.

There is but one emphatic word in it

should be tripped over quite lightly;
yet, all the many Portias I have heard

made at the least two, and usually
three, words in the line emphatic. To
make any word in the line emphatic
but strained is to suggest a meaning
not intended. The first three words
add nothing to the sense, nothing.
They are there simply as padding,
to fill out the line, or as rhetorical
embellishment, yet the majority of
readers — good, easy souls ! make
quality quite as emphatic as any other
word in the line, and often more
emphatic than the word that alone
should be emphasized. Strange that
so few readers deem it all necessary to
think! There is more in the art of

at words, few as there are that seem to
think so.
If it were anywhere said that mercy
is strained, we should properly empha-
size not, and should not emphasize
strained.

Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest ;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes

The thronéd monarch better than his crown.
Not place, but beneath, is the em-
phatic word. Take what word we please
instead of beneath-above, chosen, de-
signated-and we find that it is the
limiting, defining word that properly
gets the stress. It is only the heavy,
monotonous, elephantine style of de-
livery, which our author would seem
to sympathize with, that would dwell
on blesseth. In the sixth line, better is
the least and crown the most emphatic
word. This line usually gives the

learner more trouble than any other
line in the whole speech. There are
thoughtful readers who contend that
better is the only emphatic word in the
line, but their reasons have always
seemed to me quite valueless.
1. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
2. The attribute to awe and majesty
3. Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
4. But mercy is above this sceptred sway.
5. It is enthroned in the hearts of kings ;
6. It is an attribute to God himself:
7. And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
8. When mercy seasons justice.
In the first of these eight lines,
force is not at all emphatic, nor is at-
tribute in the second. In the third
line, kings is properly slightly more
emphatic than either dread or fear.
The thought is made clearer to many
by changing the to our. In the fourth
line, not sway, but sceptred, is the
word to emphasize. A little study en-
ables us to see that the sceptre's sway
is contrasted with mercy's sway, force

or power; it matters not which word
we use. Enthronéd, in the fifth line,
should be touched very lightly. Its
long, sonorous o is very beguiling, but
it is only the unthinking bowwower,
who reads for sound, not sense, that
would dwell on it. It, whose anteced-
ent is mercy, is properly as emphatic
as hearts. This somewhat more clear-
ly appears if we change it to that,
which, though it be Shakespeare, I do
not hesitate to intimate would better
the diction. The change would give
the reader a much better vowel sound
to deal with. In the seventh line, we
should trip lightly over them, and
should emphasize God's fully as
strongly as earthly. This is made
clear by supplying the ellipsis, power,
after God's. The sentiment, rather
than the sense, makes seasons about as
emphatic as the words immediately be-
fore and after it.

and trip over the other two words, in-
timating that she is going to sing, or
chant, or write something else for
some other purpose. The one read-
ing is as bad as the other. Plea is un-
emphatic. The comma after which is
mine. I do not find it in any one of
the three editions within my present
reach. The clause being parenthetic,
the comma seems to me to be neces-
sary. Strict, court and Venice are
equally emphatic. To emphasize
strict only is to say that there is at the
least one other court that is not strict.
At the best, strict is little else than
padding. The line is just as forcible
without it; it serves chiefly to fill out
the line. So far as sense and force
are concerned, one word, court, would
suffice. In reading the last line the
question of climax should be consid-
ered. Read for the thought only, the

elevation is attained by dwelling on
needs and 'gainst and making a slight
pause before and after 'gainst.
This speech is read in every con-
cievable manner. The Portias that I
have seen, almost without an excep-
tion, have gone at it in a pell-mell,
haphazard, slapdash way that showed
that they depended on their voice-
making apparatus rather than on the
thought, on vociferation rather than
on Shakespeare, for any effect they
might produce. They were rewarded
with the plaudits of the many; the
censure of the few did not concern

I occasionally meet a person who
seems to think that the exercise of the

an actor I met, a day or two ago, called
spontaneity, by which I understood
him to mean naturalness. He seemed
to incline strongly to the opinion that
emphasis, pause, and inflection are
matters of little importance, and that a
reader is likely to be stilted and non-
natural in proportion to the extent he
allows himself to consider the question
of technique. All that is necessary,
according to these people, if I under-

to speak them with earnestness. If
they are right, then reading is only a

they would but give half as much time
to the learning of their business, as the
average chorus-singer or clog-dancer
gives to learning his, they might possi-

the value of study. There are many
of us that are never more glib, never
more confident, never more dogmatic
than when we talk about something
we know nothing about.
But let us return to Canon Fleming
and “The Merchant of Venice":
SHYLOCK.-My deeds upon my head! I crave [the
law]
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
We all agree, I think, with regard
to the meaning of the first sentence,
which is this : For my deeds I will be

answerable. Does our author's em-
phasis make the words express this
thought? I think not. His emphasis,
to my seeing, makes the words say:
My deeds upon my head, and not on
any other part of my body. To make
the words say what they are intended
to say, it is necessary, I am confident,
to emphasize the second my as strong-
ly as the first, and this, if I do not err,
is the way the sentence is usually read.
Whether the learned Canon gives us
the full line or not, crave is not em-
phatic; it is the thing craved, the law,
that we should emphasize. The next
line, with its emphatic words, stands in
elocutionary apposition to law.
Portia.—Is he not able to discharge the money ? .
BASSANIO.—Yes, here I tender it for him in the
court!
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my feet (heart).
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth.

I fail to see any defense for the
emphasis on tender in the first line,
not in the second, not, suffice or appear
in the fifth, or for bear or down in the
sixth. On the other hand, I should
emphasize sum in the second line quite
as strongly as twice. If Bassanio said,
for example, I not only tender him the
sum we owe him, but twice the sum,
our author's emphasis would be cor-
rect, not otherwise. In the third line
I should emphasize the last three
words. The feet of the fourth line is
a new reading to me. Possibly it is a
misprint.
And I beseech you
Wrest once the law to your authority,
To do a great right do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
The emphasizing of wrest and once
smacks of the kind of elocution that
tries to get an effect out of every word.
It reminds one of those speakers that
make up in sound for what they lack

in sense. Read in this way, the line
loses much of its proper effect. All
the words but two should come “trip-
pingly from the tongue.” Why em-
phasize this in the last line? There is
no question of any other devil.
Portia.—It must not be. There is no power in
Venice
Can alter a decree established
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error, by the same example,
Will rush into the state. It can not be.
The most emphatic word in the first
sentence is the last. If it had been
said that it must be, then not should
be the only emphatic word. If it had
been said that it cannot be, then must
would be the only emphatic word. As
it is, three words are emphasized about
equally in order to give the delivery
the elevation that the situation and
sentiment demand. For the same
reason, many and error in the fourth
line should be emphasized. Neither

SHYLOCK.-A Daniel come to judgment ! Vea, a

O wise young judge! How do I honor thee.
Of these nine italicized words, I
should emphasize only five-Daniel,
yea, Daniel, wise and honor.
Portia.—I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
I should emphasize pray quite as
strongly as look, and should not em-
phasize bond.
ShylocK.-Here'tis most reverend doctor, here it is.
Shylock's eagerness is ill indicated
by all this italicizing; and then, read
according to the marking, Shylock
cannot get the effect out of the word
reverend that is within his easy reach
if he emphasizes this word only.
Portia.-Shylock! There's thrice thy money offered
thee.

One word only, thrice, is all that,
in my judgment, should be made at all
emphatic in this line. The exclamation
point is our author's. I doubt wheth-

ma is the usual punctuation.
SHYLOCK.-An oath, an oath! I have an oath in
heaven :
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ?
No, not for Venice.
The effect is weakened, rather than
heightened, by making the third oath
emphatic. I should italicize not rather
than no of the last line. Both words
should be spoken with a good deal of
force.
Portia.—Why, this bond is forfeit,
And lawfully, by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful.
Take thrice thy money. Bid me tear the bond.
In these five lines, our Author
would emphasize sixteen words; I
should emphasize only nine-forfeit,

lawfully, pound, flesh, nearest, heart,
merciful, take, and tear. “Take thrice
thy money, means, simply, Accept their
offer. Why emphasize bond since there
is no question of tearing anything
else ?
SHYLOCK.—When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me. I stay here on my bond.
In the first line of this speech, a
Shylock should not only make clear the
fact that the bond must be “paid accord-
ing to the tenor," but in order to get
all the effect out of the line there is in
it, he must also emphasize the fact
that nothing but a pound of Antonio's
flesh will be accepted. This he does
best by a peculiar, indescribable hand-
ling of the word according which re-
sults in making it the most emphatic

should emphasize law as strongly as
know. If it were a question as to
whether Portia does or does not know
the law, the case would be very differ-
ent. If the thought were, for example,
you know the law but you are not will-
ing to be guided by it. In the fourth
line I should again emphasize law.
Our author's reading of the seventh
line does not express the thought the
line is intended to convey, which is,
simply, there is no power in man to
alter me; the other words serve for
little else than for poetical embellish-
ment. The effect of the last sentence
is heightened by dwelling on on as
much as on the two preceding words.

“ The Merchant of Venice” read in
this wise:
ANTONIO.—Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.
Portia.-Why then thus it is;

SHYLOCK.-O noble judge! O excellent young man !
To my thinking, our author's reading

distinctly. I certainly should not em-
phasize them.

Portia.-For the intent and purpose of the law

Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
It would seem to me that law is
scarcely, if at all, less emphatic than
either intent or purpose. What Shy-
lock has just said about Portia's know-
ing the law does not effect the reading
of the line. Penalty should certainly
not be made more emphatic than here
and appeareth, hence I should italicize
all three or none. The wisdom of
marking bond for emphasis is ques-
tionable. No reader, I think, would
fail to give it all the prominence de-
sirable.
SHYLOCK.—'Tis very true! O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art than thy looks.
I should counsel the reader to make
quite as much of true as of very; and,

my thinking, after this one strong em-
phasis, should be enunciated quite
trippingly. Here, as always, I aim
only at what I think will heighten the
effect. Nature is a niggard and does
not expend her energies where she
will not be rewarded.
Portia.—Therefore lay bare your bosom.
SHYLOCK.—Ay, his breast.
So says the bond :-doth it not, noble judge ?
Nearest his heart. Those are the very words.
Neither doth nor judge should I em-
phasize, but I should emphasize not.
The long o of noble makes it possible
for the exultant Shylock to voice his
joy to the full. No utterance con-
ceivable of judge would aid him herein
a whit. Why emphasize those ? If
there be a reason, I cannot see it.
The bare of Portia's line should be

'Twere good you do so much for charity.
SHYLOCK.-I cannot find it. 'Tis not in the bond.
Portia.—Come, merchant, have you anything to
say?
I should not italicize not, good, or
anything. Say, it seems to me, rather
than anything, is the word to mark, if
one would mark something. Some-
times the line is read with the emphasis
on you—a reading easily defended.
ANTONIO.—But little ; I am armed and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio ; fare you
well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you.
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom.

O reason
I see no reason for making fallen
emphatic. If the word were come,
would anyone think of emphasizing it?
Herein, to my thinking, is the most em-
phatic word in the fourth line, unless it
be kind, which is very much more em-
phatic than more. If we had as kind
anywhere, then more kind would be
correct.
It is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view, with hollow eye and wrinkled brow,
An age of poverty ; from which lingering penance
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.
I should italicize neither use, outlive,
hollow, wrinkled, lingering, misery, cut,
nor off, but I should italicize eye, brow,
poverty, such, and me, I should hope
and expect to get a better result than
our author by marking the lines thus:
It is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view, with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow,
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.

THE ESSENTIALS
It is quite safe, I think, to leave the
secondary emphases to take care of
themselves. I strongly suspect that
our author often employs rules in de-
termining what words should be em-
phasized. If he does, I incline to the
opinion that he succeeds no better
with them than others have succeeded
with them. It is safe to say that the
average rule-user goes wrong more fre-
quently than he goes right. The rule
of gumption is the only rule that is
worth a fig in determining what words
should be emphasized
Commend me to your honorable wife;
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you : speak me fair in death,
And when the tale is told bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
I question the wisdom of marking
any word in the first two of these five
lines for emphasis, there being no em-
phasis that is at all salient. If honor-
able, however, is marked, then wife

should also be marked, else we might
argue that we have in the reading an
intimation that Bassanio is a polyga-
mist. In the third line I should not
emphasize say or speak. By empha-
sizing bid in the fourth line instead of
her, we spoil the rhythm of an other-
wise perfect line. There can be no
doubt, I think, that Shakespeare em-
phasized her.
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt ;
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Our author's reading of the first
three of these four lines seems to me
to be very bad indeed. In fact, I don't
see how it could easily be worse. The
most offensive thing in it is the empha-
sis on and the pause after for. The
emphasizing of the or's and for's, and
the particles generally, is a character-
istic of that species of reader known

in stage parlance as the scene chewer.
There is not a syllable in the four lines
that should be touched more lightly
than the first syllable of the third line.
I should read these lines thus :
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

“There cannot be two right ways to read a sen-
tence any more than there can be two right solutions
to a mathematical problem. There can be only one
reading that fully brings out the thought."
Canon Fleming proceeds, in his
“Art of Reading and Speaking,” which
he dedicates, “to all who desire to be
cultured readers and speakers of our
mother tongue,” to mark the emphatic
words in the Trial Scene of “The
Merchant of Venice" in this wise:
BASSANIO—Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself ;


## p. 151 (#165) ############################################

OF ELOCUTION.
151
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteemed above thy life;
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil to deliver you.
It is a mistake, it seems to me, to
mark wife in the first line for emphasis,
as I do not think that more should be
made of it than of married. Not life
but itself in the second line is the em-
phatic word. Words ending in self
are used in most cases for emphasis
only; they seldom add to the thought.
Commonly the word preceding should
also be emphasized, but here we have
an exception; the emphasis on itself
suffices. If the not in the fourth line
contradicted a preceding affirmative,
it would be proper to emphasize it.
The emphatic words in this line are
esteemed, thy, and life. The first of
the three, however, may safely be left
to take care of itself. Why emphasize
this? There is no question of any
other devil. Deliver, not you, is the

emphatic word. Put any word we
please in the place of deliver-rescue
or release, for example—and we find it
naturally gets the emphasis, I should
mark this speech thus:

Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteemed above thy life;
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all,

PORTIA-Your wife would give you little thanks
lí she were by to hear you make the offer.
Neither wife, little, nor hear should
I emphasize, but I should emphasize
thanks. If we had not the last three
words of the second line, hear would
get the emphasis that now goes to
offer.
GRATIANO-I have a wife whom I protest I love .
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
In these three lines our author marks

NERISSA.—'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet home.
Here again, I should mark only half
as many words for emphasis as our
author-back, else and home. Else, to
my thinking, is the most emphatic
word in the speech. With the empha-
sis on well I should not quarrel.
SHYLOCK.— These be the Christian husbands! I have a
daughter ;
Would any of the stock of Barabbas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian !
We trifle time: I pray thee pursue sentence.
In the first line I should emphasize
neither husbands nor I. Our author
emphasizes 1, possibly because Bas-
sanio and Gratiano have said they
have wives. If this be his reason,
which is the only reason I can see, I
do not think it sufficient. In the
second line, I should not emphasize
either would or stock. Nor in the

third line should I emphasize husband.
The cæsura, as is frequently the case,
makes the word sufficiently prominent.
Portia.-A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.
The court awards it and the law doth give it.
SHYLOCK.—Most rightful judge.
Portia.-And you must cut this flesh from off his
breast:
The law allows it and the court awards it.
SHYLOCK.-Most learnéd judge! A sentence! Come,
prepare!
In the first line, I should not empha-
size merchant's; nor in the fourth line,
flesh. Judge I should not emphasize
in either instance; all the emphasis
should go to the adjectives.
Portia.-1. Tarry a little : There is something else.
2. This bond-doth give thee here—no jot
of blood;

4. Then take thy bond ; take thou thy

In a foot-note our author says :
“ This passage to be read very slowly
and deliberately." Herein I think his
dramatic instinct is greatly at fault.
Read as he advises, the speech would
not produce half its possible effect.
Nor would it produce half its possible
effect emphasized as he emphasizes it;
it would be wholly wanting in climax,
which it is far from wanting if the last
two lines are properly spoken.
Neither little nor something in the
first line should have any emphasis
whatever; all the words but tarry and
else should be gone over quite trip-
pingly. Then the first six words of
the second line should be spoken in
like manner, a pause being made after
them of sufficient length to enable the
reader to take a full, deep breath,
which should be mainly expended on
the word blood—the turning point in
Shylock's fortunes. In the fourth line,


## p. 156 (#170) ############################################

156
THE ESSENTIALS
I should emphasize take in both clauses
very strongly, but should not empha-
size pound. In the fifth line, I should
ignore the first comma, since obsery-
ing it retards the movement necessary
to produce the effect the speech should,
and always will, produce if properly
handled. Shed, one and Christian
should not be emphasized. Emphasiz-
ing these words takes from the snap,
the movement, the earnestness—in a
word from the naturalness of the de-
livery, which always has been, and for-
evermore will be, the only legitimate
thing to consider in making one's elo-
cution effective. But it is in the last
two lines that our author's reading of
this speech is singularly weak. He
leaves unmarked the two most em-
phatic words in the whole eight lines,
the two words that the skillful Portia
specially depends on for her climax,
and for the round of applause that she

is sure to get-confiscate and state.
To emphasize laws in the seventh line
would be to suggest a meaning not in-
tended. The whole clause should be
tripped over lightly. Before and after
the word confiscate, the reader should
take a full breath; the first he should
expend on confiscate, the second almost
wholly on state. It matters little
whether the last two words are heard
or not. Here is the way I should
mark the speech :
Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here—no jot of blood.
The words expressly are-a pound of flesh.
Then take thy bond ; take thou thy pound of flesh,
But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, CONFISCATE-
Unto the state of Venice.
GRATIANO.-O upright judge! Mark, Jew! A learnéa
judge.
To emphasize so much is to empha-
size nothing at all. To my thinking,


## p. 158 (#172) ############################################

upright, mark, and learnéd are the
only emphatic words.
SHYLOCK.-Is that the law ?
Portia.—Thyself shall see the act,
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou
desirest.
I should ignore the comma after for,
should emphasize urgest, should trip
lightly over assured, and should not
emphasize justice in the third line.
Urge and have seem to me to stand in
direct contradistinction.
GRATIANO.-0 learnéd judge! Mark, Jew! A learnéd
judge !
Three words only should I empha-
size in this line--learnéd, mark, and
learned.
SHYLOCK.—I take his offer, then: pay the bond thrice,
And let the Christian go.
BASSANI0.—Here is the money.
I should certainly not emphasize
bond, nor should I mark anything in
Bassanio's speech for emphasis.

If I were to mark any word in the
first line of this speech for emphasis, it
would be the first. The words our
author marks should not, it seems to
me, be made at all emphatic. The ef-
fect of the comma after therefore em-
phasizes it sufficiently, which was
doubtless our author's thought when
he left it unitalicized.


## p. 161 (#175) ############################################

OF ELOCUTION.

In the second line I should empha-
size only three words—blood, less, and
more. The emphasizing of shed and
cut seems to me utterly indefensible.
Here, it seems to me, is as good an
example as we could well have of that
unreasonable, trip-hammer delivery
that has brought the very name of
elocution into disfavor. To read after
this fashion, a modicum of intelligence
and a pair of stilts for the voice are
the sum of all that is required.
In the third line, in addition to the
words italicized, I should emphasize
flesh, and that, too, much more strong-
ly than any other word in the line. The
reason: Shakespeare, I take it, with
the words, “ But just a pound of flesh,”
imposes on Portia the task of making
supremely prominent a very important
fact that does not appear in the naked
words, namely, the fact that this pound
of flesh must be made up of flesh only

but I sho
-no blood, no bone, nothing but flesh.
This is the letter of the bond; the
spirit of the bond, it is conceded, Portia
studiously ignores. Now this thought,
which adds greatly to the import and
effectiveness of the half dozen words,
can only be brought out by a peculiar
and very strong emphasis on flesh.
In the fourth line, I should not em-
phasize just, so or much, but I should
emphasize pound. The word just, it
will be perceived, can be dispensed
with without any loss to the thought
or to the effect.
The most emphatic word in the fifth,
sixth, and seventh lines is division,
which, it would seem, our author would
not have us emphasize. The thought,
if I do not err, is this: “Makes it eith-
er light or heavy in the whole, or even
in a part, of the twentieth of a scruple,"
which appears only when division is
; strongly emphasized.

In the seventh and eighth lines, I
should not emphasize scale, turn, but or
estimation; poor, however, I should
emphasize as strongly as the words be-
fore and after it.
There might be something in the
context that would justify the em-
phasis on all in the ninth line; as it is,
however, the emphatic word is goods.
GRATIANO.—A second Daniel! A Daniel, Jew!
Now, in fidel, I have thee on the hip.
In the first line, I should emphasize
neither second nor Jew. If Gratiano, in
the second line, would intimate that
the Jew has had his opponents on the
hip, which I think is the traditional
rendering, he should not emphasize
hip: if this be not his thought, he
should trip over thee and emphasize
hip. In neither case, should both words
be emphasized. If Gratiano would
taunt Shylock with being an infidel,

the word infidel should be emphasized,
not otherwise.
Portia.—Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy for-
feiture.
SHYLOCK.-Give me my principal and let me go.
BASSANIO.--I have it ready for thee. Here it is.
Portia.-He hath refused it in the open court.
He shall have merely justice, and his bond.
GRATIANO.-A Daniel, still say I ; a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
SHYLOCK.-Shall I not have barely my principal?
Portia.-Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
SHYLOCK.-Why then, the Devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.
My marking of these eight speeches
would not differ materially from that
of our author. Why in the first speech,
that and word in the fifth, and good
in the last I should, probably, have
left unmarked. In marking the em-
phatic words of prose or verse, it is
better to err on the side of marking
too few words than on the side of too
many. I am by no means sure, for
example, that as devil, in the last

it. If she does see it, she, like the
others, fails to make it appear, which,
at the least is very good evidence that
she does not see it. If we look at the
language at all closely, it readily ap-
pears that under the Venetian law it
was one thing if an alien sought the
life of an alien, or a citizen sought the
life of a citizen, and quite another
thing if an alien sought the life of a
citizen. Here, as ever, if one would
read well, the first condition is to
know what the language means.
It will be seen that in the seventh
line, our author emphasizes party and
that I do not. The thought is brought
out, not by emphasizing the noun, but
by emphasizing the qualifying, limit-
ing, adjectival clause that follows it.
Would anyone think of emphasizing
the noun, if we resolve the limiting
clause into one word thus: The en-
dangered, or threatened party; or say,
u well, the language the sevent

the party threatened ? It is really
thoughts that we emphasize, not
words; and when a clause expresses
an emphatic thought, a thought
that perhaps might be expressed with
a single word, the stress is about
equal on the principal words, the last
word, usually, if we are true to nature,
being made slightly the most promi-
nent. In the reading, party becomes
quite prominent, not however because
we emphasize it, but because of the
rhetorical pause that naturally follows
it. Our author's comma should not be
there; we should not separate nouns
from words or clauses that limit or
qualify them. The pause after party
is purely rhetorical.
Students of the art of reading will,
I think, find it interesting, and per-
haps profitable, to study this speech
carefully. Though they may not

Why emphasize our? There is no
question of difference between any but
the Duke and the Jew. The thought

being the difference between us, we
have only to emphasize difference and
spirit to bring it out.
In the second line, I see but two em-
phatic words-life and ask.
In the third line, I should emphasize
wealth and Antonio's. If a discussion as
to what should be done with Shylock's
fortune had taken place and this were
the resulting decision, our author's em-
phasis would be correct. Portia simply
tells what the law is; no discussion is
even suggested.
Why emphasize general in the fourth
line? There is no question anywhere
of any private state. Indeed, general
adds nothing to the thought; it's used
only to pad out the line. Being used,
it may be said to coalesce with state in
expressing what state would fully ex-
press unaided, and thus come in for a
sort of subordinate emphasis ; the
strong emphasis properly goes to the

noun. I see no reason for emphasizing
half.
If the Duke means to say in the last
line, Which humbleness may, POSSIBLY,
which I think he does, then may, by a
good deal, is probably the most em-
phatic word in the whole speech. I
should italicize fine.
Portia.—Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
In the last clause, Antonio, if I do
not err, is the word to emphasize.
SHYLOCK.-Nay, take my life and all; pardon not
that :
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house ; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.
The emphasis on take, in the first
line, is indefensible. If the Duke had
said Shylock's life should be taken,
Shylock could say, for example, Very
well; proceed, take my life. As it is,
Shylock virtually says this : If you
take my goods, take my life and all.

It is more difficult to realize the pos-

ful whether four lines could be found
anywhere that are susceptible of being
made more pathetic.
Portia.—What mercy can you render him, Antonio ?
GRATIANO.-A halter gratis ; nothing else, for
Heaven's sake.
I can see no reason for emphasizing
either mercy or nothing.

author's reading. The language means
no more than: If it please the Duke
and the court, hence court and not all

I should mark no word for emphasis
in the second line, but in reading the

of, since with them the line is prose,
while without them its rhythm is per-

by the omission.
Half, in the fourth line; stole, in the
sixth, and record, in the seventh, are
words I should not emphasize. If I
fully understand what Antonio would
say, the adverbial clause, Here in the
court, must be emphasized in order to
make him say it.
