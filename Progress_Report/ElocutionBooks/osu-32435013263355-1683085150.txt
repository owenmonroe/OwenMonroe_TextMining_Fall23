But as for Geſture, there never

excellently nice, new, even to a firſt

A gentle regular Movement of

goes a great way in the Character
of a public Orator; for nothing can
be ſo engaging, or ſo much admired

lèt-off Reaſon and Thought with Grace,

So that the Great Maſters of Rheto-

Tome time ſince to a Nobleman of France,';
that, to my thinking, was an excellent
Diſcourſe, as well for the Depth of
Argument, as for the Fineneſs and
Strength of Eloquence ; and, it had
certainly got that Credit too upon
any unprejudiced Perſon's reading of it:
But for all this, it was ſo indifferent-
ly deliver'd by a Gentleman that had
a natural impediment in his speech, and
one too that had no more Geſture than
a Poſt ; or if he had any, 'twas ſo
rintoward and ungenteel, that not a
Man of the Company but diſrelifh'd the

in them. Hortenſius, on the other hand,
ſeeing himſelf mightily admir'd for his
Pleading, aſcrib'd all the Honour of it

Action, and they had rather difplcafe
all the World, than be at the Trouble
of acquiring it. Such as they in the
Primitive Times, condemn’d the Uſe of
Eloquence in Preaching ; till St. Chryfo-
ſtom confuted' them, and vindicated it
againſt Afperfion and Calumny, in his
Bouks of the Prieſt-hood. There are
fonie preciſe People again, will decry it
out of a Phanatical Superftition and
Melancholy ; becauſe it is neither for
their Palate nor Purity, forfootb; and
they like nothing that pleaſes Senſe,
be it never lo ulēful and profitable to
the Soul: So that whatever Itrikes the
Humour of the Age, muſt needs diſguſt
Them.

I will make it my Buſineſs here to un-
deceive them as far as I can, both as
to the Religion of the Scruple, and the
Truth of the Matter.
They ſay in the firſt place, with a
regard to preachers ; that Action is un-
worthy of their Miniſtry, and that it
is a ſeandalous thing for thoſë God hath
honoured with ſo ſerious and ſublime
a Function, to be ſtudying in the very
Exerciſe of it, how to frame their Voice
and move their Body, when they ſhould
think of nothing but his Glory; no-
thing but the Majeſty of his Myſteries,
the Holineſs of his Precepts, the Edi-
fying of his Church, and the Salvation
of his Ele&t. For to pretend (ſay they)
to make people believe the Truth,
and to win Souls to Faith, Piety and all
Chriſtian Virtues, not only by the E-
loquence of their Stile, but alſo by the
Grace of Speaking and Power of Gifture,
is to ſink Religion into Senſe, and to
make that which is Spiritual depend
upon Carnal Worſhip, Human Invention,
and External Flouriſh.

they urge, Religion would be a cunning

it was not by this Means they made fo

his Fourth Book of Chriſtian Doctrine

shew them how to Spoak with ſuch a
Grace ; that, inſtead of giving their
Hearers an Averſion by a bad Pronoun-
ciation and a Diſagreeable Geſturė, they
may edify them, not only with their
Diſcourſe and Stile, but in ſome meaſure
alſo by the Decency of their Speaking
and the Fineneſs of their Aftion. And
I ſhall give 'em Rules here for order-
ing both the one and the other ſo
Handſomely, and with ſuch a regard to
Good Manners, that nothing may ap-
pear in it againſt Religion ; nothing
that does not become the Dignity af

that does not breath of Piety, of De-
votion and of Zeal; nothing that is

clinations, and to carry them on to

Pains to pleaſe than to profit, and a.
muſe himſelf how to tickle their Ears
inſtead of thinking ſeriouſly how to
inſtruct their- Minds and edify their
Conſciences. 'Tis true ineed, this is to
pleaſe their Senſes : But then that plea-
ſure, as it tends to the Glory of God
and the Converſion of their Souls'; 26
as it delights their Attention to the
good things they are told, and helps
their Memories to retain what they
hear ; it is without Doubt very inno-
cent, and very Holy and Reverend as
well as profitable and pleaſing. So
that if Action be ſuſpended from Pub-
lick Devotion for pleaſing the Senfes,
they may as well forbid the Tle of Man
fick in the Church, becauſe it Itrikes
the Paſſions of the Soul, and ſets them
at work upon Heaven : And yet the
Old Testament makes a laudable Pra.
Ttice of it, for ſinging the ſweet Songs of
Ifrael, and the admirable Soft Airs of
Sion, which their very Enemies, the
Ægyptians, would have been glad to
have heard from the Mouths of the
Ifraelites under the Ami&tion of their

My next Caution is for young people,
that are naturally bent upon Imitation,
and eſpecially the Imitation of thoſe
Perſons that brought them up, as their
'Fathers and Tutors, who are moſt in their
Thoughts, and beſt in their Opinions ;
to take care left they imitate them in
Things contrary to Art and Reaſon. For
they ought to examine the Practice of
their parents and Maſters, as well as
other Men, by the Rules of this Art of
Speaking and Giffure ; as they are bound
to'enquire into their Morals, and to die
ſtinguish their honeſt Aétions from difho-
noft ones, by the Word of God and the
Principles of Morality ; with a Defign
to fly the Bad and follow the Good.
Young Gentlemen, I ſay, ought to take
great care in this matter, becauſe Chile
dren often imitate their Fathers in the
one as well as the other, without di-
•ftinguiſhing upon the Quality of their
Manners. Witneſs Young Alcibiades

commonly fo great an Eſteem and Ve-
neration for their Maſters, that they are
too apt to admire and to practice their
Vices as well as their Virtues. So we
read that Plato's Scholars imitated his
Clowniſh way of florugging up his shoul-

who are not without their fail-

M. Briffon the Preſident, ſays Monſieur
dr Vair, was a Man of excellent Lear-
ning and Parts, and had the beſt Fa-
culties in the World for Eloquence;
but his Action was naught: He ſtood
always in the ſame Poſture ; was ſtarch'd
and stiff-neck'd; lift up his Eyes, and
fix'd'em upon Heaven as if he had been
going to Prayers; which ſome Peo-
ple fay he did for fear of being di-
verted from his Buſineſs, and diſtur-
bed in his Memory by the Variety of
Objects.
And therefore young men would do

Great Perſons as theſe ; but for the

is, that People would be unwilling to
give themſelves "the trouble " of bearing
him; for whatever is difficult to the Ear,
muſt needs be heard with Chagrin and
Impatience, becauſe it requires 1o

attention : And then again, the Audi-
tor that could have the patience for a
while, would without doubt be! haran-

couraged from hearing him out, if this
forced attention were to hold for any
long time. The other diſadvantage
would be this ; that when the Ear were
at ſo much Pains to make out his words,
the mind 'would be ſo much the leſs at-
tentive to the matter of his Diſcourſe,
which is always the beſt worth our while

- Set off his Harangües with the Graces
of Good Speaking and Geſture, I would
adviſe hina to make amends for that
failing by Figures that adorn the Speech
and ſoften the ſound of words; by fine
Turns of Expreſſion; by the Elegant
| number of Oratory and the delicate
Cadences of his Periods : So that his
Diſcourſes, like Ifocrates's, may be a-
greeable enough of themſelves, with.
out A&tion ; or without being Read
with much Art and Study. But the
Man that lies under no greater Im-
pediment than
of having only a
weak Voice, need not deſpair, nor be
diſcouraged from attempting to Speak
upon Pubeck Occaſions, but ought to
do what he can rather to ſtrengthen
it up and accompliſh it for that purpoſe
.
Demoſthenes did lo, and gained his point
too. However, Plutarch fãys in his
Life, that he had naturally a weak Voice,
an impediment in his Speech, a Short
Breath; and yet he ventured in ſpight of
Fate and all his failings, to ſpeak
publickly twice ; But he was hiſſed both
times. He adds alſo, that the Orator
being diſcountenanced by the bad fuc-
ceſs, made his Complaint to Satyrus,

.than any Orator of 'em all, and could
sever: yet pleaſe people. Why, ſays Sa-
tyrus, take no thought, Man: I'll mend

Upon this he made him repeat ſome
Veiſes out : of Euripides, or Sophocles ;
which he did, you muſt think, with a
very ill Grace. But when he had made
ſuch ſtuff on't, Satyrus ſaid the ſame Ver-
ſes after him: and he gave them ſuch

Great Maſters of Rhetoric, gave De-

Applicacion and Eagerneſs. Well then !

S thc Body has three dimenſions,
for its Length, Breadth and
Thickneſs ; fo the Voice has three
principal differences of Highneſs or Low-
nefs, of Vehemence or Softneſs, and of
Swiftnefs. or Slownefs. The Orator's bu-
finetz is to keep up a juſt meaſure in all
theſe diſtinctions, and to obſerve that
variety, throughout the whole Speech,
which we have allerted for lo neceſſary
a Virtue.

But the chief thing will be to maintain
a true medium of the Voice, becauſe both
the extremes of it are vicious and diſagree-
able. And therefore, firſt, with a re-
gard to the height of it, we muſt have

much offends the Throat of the Speaker
to a Hoarſeneſs, and the Ears of the

Voice likewilë; on the contrary, into
the loweſt baſe, and keep it always in
the ſame toric, would be to mutter rather
than to Speak; and it would make a ve-

their Voice, they did it ſo very grofly

Biſe' of, and the variety of his words
and his Phraſe.
To begin then with the Subje&ts of
Diſcourſe which the Orator may chance
to fall upon; there are ſeveral ſorts of
them: As things natural, the good or
evil actions of men; the happy or unhap-
py events of Life: And thelė things be-
ing all of a very differene nature, ought
to be ipoken with a q different ac-
sent and air. If you've occaſion to
ſpeak of natural things, with an inten-
tion only to make your hearers under-
ſtand you and no more, there's no need
of any great heat or motion upon the
matter; but a clean and a diſtinct Voice
will do't; becauſe your buſineſs here is
not to move the Will and Affections, ſo
much as to inform the Underſtanding:
But if your deſign be to make them
admire the Wonders of his Bounty, of
his Wiſdom and of his Pomer that created
them; you muſt then do it with a Grave
Voice and a Tone of Admiration.

the Harmony of the other. If your Speech
proceeds from a violent Paſſion, it pro-
duces a violent Pronunciation; if it comes
from a Peaceable and Gentle Thought,
the Pronunciation again is as Peuceable,
Gentle and Calm : So that the Orator
would do well to adjuſt every Tone and
Accent of his voice to each Paſſion that
afflicts or overjoys him, which he
would raiſe in others to a Degree of

He will fhew his Love beſt by a Soft,

not put himſelf in a Paſſion nor raiſc

only to inform his Hearers, or to in-

the Pronunciation to be a Degree higher

the Period is longer than ordinary ; 0-

thote that hear you, and perhaps your
own faculties too, would be confounded :
and the Period, tho' never ſo well turn-

appear embaraſſed by the length of it.
However, when there are ſeveral Clauſes

moſt paſſionate and loud Voice : or, to
complain and lament ; as unfortunate,
miſerable, fatal, mournful, pitiful, deplo-
rable, lamentable, are all ſorrowful Words,
and require a melancholy Accent. He muſt
alſo lay more Streſs upon Words of Cuan-
tity; as, grand, high, ſublime, profound,
long, large, innumerable, eternal; as
well as upon Words of Univerſality; as
all the World, generally, every where, al-
ways, never : Here the Pronounciation
muſt be pois'd to a certain Gravity and
Height of Accent. As for thoſe Terms
of Extenuattion and Slighı ; as, pitiful,
inſignificant, little, low, mean, deſpicable
feeble, he muſt pronounce 'em with
a very low, leſſening, abject Voice, and

Diſcourſe. For this Realon, Pliny Junior
mentioning thë Recitations which People
in his Days made of their Orations and
Poems to their Friends, either in reading
’en themſelves, or in having them read
by others; ſays, that this Reading of
them was a mighty Diſadvantage to
their Eloquence and Character, becaule the
main Helps of Pronunciation, the Eyes
and the Hands, were hinder'd by't ; and
that it was no wonder if the Attention
of their Auditors droop'd upon it. But
on the contrary, when the Diſcourſe is
help'd on and enforced, not only with
a' Pronunciation ſuitable to the Subject,
but with an agreeable and powerful Ge-
Sture, it appears truly animated to a
wonderful Degree of Life and Vigour :
For then the Orator holds his Auditor
(as it were) by the Eyes as well as by
the Ears, and abſolutely engages both
his Attention and his Reaſon at once:
And if he ſpeaks thus to an Adverſary
not ſo well qualified, he daſhes him out
of Countenance, he confounds him with
Tear, and overcomes him with Shame. Ci-

This would run you foul upon that vice
which the Antients have call'd the baba
bling of the Hands. And it would be
below the Gravity, Character and Qua-
lity of an Orator, to turn Mimick in

ons which you can repreſent with De-
cency and good Manners, your Geſture
ought to be very moderate and modeſt; j
not bold, vaſt and extenſive, nor in-
deed too frequent neither, which would
make ſuch a violent Agitation of the
Arms and the Hands as would not be-
come an Orator, and as if he were chan
ſing away Flies. This was Curion's fault,

but wants all the external Advantages

fpiſe theſe Precepts, although ſome of
them ſeem to be light and childiſh, or

I must add this, that when I ſay the O-

·mcan, that either the Lawyer ſhould be
poring upon it, when he Pleads his Cauſe;
or the Divine, when he Preaches his Ser-
mon. For he ought to think of nothing
at that Time but the Matter in Hand
and he muſt not be ſtudying any other
Motions or Paſſions then, but uſe thoſe
only which ariſe naturally from the Sub-

where he ſpeaks, and the Preſence of the
