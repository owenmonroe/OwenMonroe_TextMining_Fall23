THE CRITIQUE OF THE SENTENCE.
AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXPRESSION IN COMPOSI-
TION, OR STYLE, explained and applied in the lec-
tures of the professor, and designed to guide the
student in the criticism of language.
This course of lectures and practical lessons was
given at Antioch College, and at the Meadville
Theologic School, where the author is a non-resi-
dent professor.
I. - PURITY.
The sentence free from errors in
1. PUNCTUATION, by Rules based on the “New
Analysis of the Sentence."
2. ORTHOGRAPHY, according to Webster or Wor-
cester.
3. ETYMOLOGY, avoiding barbarisms, foreign and

1. PRECISION, in the use of words, especially in
the use of Synonyms.
2. PERSPICUITY, in the arrangement of words and
clauses.
3. COMPLETENESS, in the proper supply of words.
III.
ENERGY.
The form of the sentence best calculated to give
proper emphasis to the thought by -
1. UNITY, as opposed to clauses irrelevant, or too
remote from the main thought.
2. TERSENESS, as opposed to tautology and a
redundancy of words.
3. EMPHASIS, by the proper arrangement of words
and clauses.
4. STRENGTJI, as derived from the use of specific,
instead of general and abstract terms.
IV.- BEAUTY.
In which the Euphony, Rhythm, and Imagery of
the sentence are considered.
1. EUPHONY, as to the choice and arrangement of
words.
2. RHYTHM, in the disposition of accents, and the

A fritique on the l'onduet of
ritique on the Wonduct of thought.
Thought
EXPLAINED AND APPLIED IN THE LECTURES OF THE
PROFESSOR, AND DESIGNED TO ASSIST THE PUPIL IN
THE ANALYSIS AND CONDUCT OF THE THOUGHT IN
COMPOSITION IN THE FORM OF ABSTRACTS.*
1. — UNITY.
Unity in composition is secured -
1. By having but one theme, or subject; which is
the leading topic of the composition.
2. One chief object in the discussion; which must
be either explanation, argumentation, excitation, or
persuasion.
3. By having each subordinate topic logically or
generically connected with the preceding, and with
the general subject, and all subservient to the
common object of the composition.
II. — SELECTION.
A good selection secures
1. Such minor topics of the composition as best
discuss and illustrate the chief topic or theme.
2. Whatever conduces to the proper object of the
composition; as an explanation, an argumentation,
an excitation, or a persuasion.
* The professor makes the study and composition of Abstracts a
very important part of composition.


## p. 5 (#7) ################################################

5
3. A good selection avoids too many and too
general topics in the discussion of the main subject.
4. The topics discussed should have a natural and
easy gradation, without any abrupt transitions.
III. - - ORDER.
Order requires -
1. That the several topics of the composition be
arranged on the principles of co-ordination and sub-
ordination to the general subject and to each other.
2. That the progress of the composition, so far as
the object embraces all the methods of discussion,
be in the following oriler: 1st, Introduction; 2d,
Explanation ; 3d, Argumentation ; 4th, Excitation ;
5th, Persuasion ; 6th, Peroration.
3. That each of these objects of composition be
given its proper order of development.
IV.- COMPLETENESS.
Requires -
1. Such a discussion of the subject as will give a
full and distinct idea of the whole; and
2. As will fully attain the object of the discussion.
The highest reach of completeness is - exhaustive
of the subject.”
V. - QUALITY.
The genius and spirit of composition, as distin-
guished froin its correctness in form, may be termed
its quality. The composition may exhibit high
qualities of imagination, wit, humor, or reason, &c.,
and yet be deficient in form and correctness.

Directions in the proper Preparation and Criticism of a
Composition.
1. Reserve an inch of blank space on the left of each
page. On this left-hand space, opposite the sentence, mark
the criticism on the style of expression, referring to that
section of the “ critique of the sentence” in which the mis-
take lies, by the appropriate figures, as there given. For
example; a mistake in Purity under Etymology, is marked
thus, — I. 2; under Propriety, thus, — I. 4; a mistake in
Clearnes, under Precision, thus, — II. 1, &c.
2. In connection with each composition, and on a separate
paper, give a full abstract of the composition, reserving a
left-hand space as before.*
On this space mark the mistakes in the conduct of the
thought, referring to the divisions of the “ Critique of
Thought,” by the figures, as there given. Thus, a viola-
tion of the Law of Unity may be marked I. 1; or thus,
- I. 3 ; under the Law of Selection, thus, - II. 2; or thus, –
II. 4; &c., &c.
3. On the back of the composition, after the name and
date, mark a summary of the criticism of the composition
under each general topic of the two" Critiques,” according
to the following method of indicating the grade and correct-
66
ness :-
6
1st GRADE.
2d
3d
4th
5th
Excellent.
Good.
Deficient.
Passable.
Not passable.
66
* The professor instructs the pupils how to prepare abstracts, - a
very important point of instruction.


## p. 7 (#9) ################################################

7
For example, a composition might be marked thus, as a
Summary of criticism on it and on its abstract:-
STYLE.
I. PURITY,- Excellent.
II. CLEARNESS,
- Good.
III. ENERGY, – Deficient.
IV. BEAUTY, Passable.
THOUGHT.
I. UNITY, — Good.
II. SELECTION, Passable.
III. ORDER, Deficient.
IV. COMPLETENESS, Not passable.
V. QUALITY, — Good (in Imagination and Wit).
a
4. If, under any general topic of the Critiques, the com-
position is marked“ not passable,” it may be written over
again, if the profes or thinks it worthy of a second trial.
5. The student should write a first draft of the composi-
tion, to which he or she must apply the principles of the
two Critiques above given, as explained by the professor ;
then prepare a second copy, thus corrected, for the criticism
of the professor.

Testimonials to the Lectures of Prof. Zachos.
From Chief-Justice S. P. Chase.
It gives me great pleasure to say, that I have long known Prof.
Zachos as a gentleman of genius and high literary accomplishments,
and eminently worthy of the regard of worthy men. I trust he will
meet with a kind reception wherever he goes, and that his success
and acceptance as a Lecturer on the Poets and Dramatists may be
equal to his high eminence in this department of public instruction
and popular entertainment of the more exalted kind.
From the Hon. Horace Mann, formerly Pres. of Antioch
College.
Prof. Zachos is a gentleman and a scholar. He is exceedingly
well versed in English Literature, and his Lectures and Readings in
this department are at once highly entertaining and instructive.
From the Hon. Thomas Corwin.
Prof. Zachos is a man of superior mind. He has lectured, to my
knowledge, with great acceptance; and I heartily commend his
Lectures and Re:idings to all who have any literary taste to cultivate.
From Citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio.
At the last audience to a course of eight lectures on some of the
Poets of the Language, and on Shakspeare, with Readings, delivered
in the winter of 1856–7, the following resolutiɔn was offered by the
Hor. Robert Hosea, and unanimously adopted :-
Resolved, That the thanks of those who have attended this Course
of Lectures and Shakspearian Readings are due to Prof. Zachos, for
the high entertainment and instruction which he has afforded.
From Hon. Andrew D. White, Pres. of Cornell University,
Ithaca, N.Y.
Prof. Zachos is very favorably known as a public Lecturer and
Reader in Literature. He has just concluded a course of Lectures
and Readings here, which have given us all real profit and pleasure.
I commend him most gladly.
From the Rev. Dr. Bellows, N.Y.
Prof. Zacho, is a scholar and a man of character.
He has re-
markable taste and power as a Lecturer in the departments he has
selected.

From M. C. Tyler, Prof. of Elocution and Rhetoric in
Michigan University.
I find Prof. Zachos a man of great experience in education, and
full of exact and philosophical views in Elocution and Rhetoric. I
have derived great advantage from his conversation relating to my
own departments.
From Homer B. Sprague, Prof. of English Literature,
Rhetoric, and Elocution in Cornell University, Ithaca,
N.Y.
Prof. J. C. Zachos is the well-known author of several very
valuable works on Elocution, and long distinguished as a successful
teacher of Oratory, and Lecturer on English Literature. He gave,
during the last year, a course of twelve lectures on Elocution, before
the students of our University; and I can bear testimony to their
valuable and suggestive character, making the subject entertaining
as well as instructive. I may add that Prof. Zachos is too well
known as a gentleman of refined taste, liberal culture, and high
moral worth, to need any recommendation. He achieves success
because he deserves it.
From James Allen, Principal of the English and Classic
School, West Newton, Mass.
Our school has enjoyed a rare privilege in listening to a course
of Lectures upon Literature and Elocution by Prof. J. C. Zachos.
The professor succeeds admirably in the difficult task and rare
power of combining a fine and discriminating analysis with a supe-
rior dramatic skill in the readings of his authors. Thus he succeeds
in interesting children and the popular mind, while he satisfies the
thoughtful and critical, and makes his Lectures instructive and
practical lessons in Elocution, Composition, and Literature.
From the Principals of several Schools of Young Ladies
in Boston.
Our experience and observation accord entirely with the opin-
ions expressed by Prof. James Allen, as above given.
Miss Tilden, Prin. Young Ladies' School, 77 Charles St.
Miss Johnson, Prin. Young Ladies' School, 48 Bowdoin St.
