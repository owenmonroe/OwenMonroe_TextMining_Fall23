INTRODUCTION. 
 
 In the following pages, it is the aim of the author to bring be- 
 fore the mind, in the most simple and concise manner, the 
 much neglected Art of Elocution. 
 
 The following are some of its special features. 
 
 1. The definitions are plain and short, yet conveying the 
 true meaning. 
 
 2. The divisions of the subjects are arranged for blackboard 
 exercises, as they are fixed more firmly on the mind, when 
 brought before the eye. 
 
 3. Under each subject, appropriate examples are furnished, 
 w T hich impress more firmly the idea conveyed by the definition. 
 
 4. In the most difficult parts of Intonation, the philosophy 
 of voice is given. Thus the student may, at once, see the man- 
 ner of producing tone, and he is not left merely to wander in 
 the realms of his own imagination. 
 
 5. A table of exercises in Vocal Gymnastics is given for the 
 frequent practice of the student, as it is impossible to secure 
 free use of the organs of speech, without good and easy respi- 
 ration. 
 
 6. The subject of Gesticulation is mostly presented in dia- 
 gram, which is the most effective way of expressing a thought. 
 Thus, the vivid images of the subject are delineated to the stu- 
 dent and they become, as it were, creatures of his own mind.

6 INTRODUCTION. 
 
 After extending his most grateful thanks to all who have aid- 
 ed him in any way, either in the arrangement or publication of this 
 little book, the author will say that, if it shall add another tro- 
 phy to the modern march of mind, or shall cause one holy as- 
 piration of the noble and divine science and art of Elocution to 
 flit across the mind of an} r one who shall read these pages, he 
 will feel himself many times repaid for his unceasing toil in its 
 preparation.

64 Thoughts must breathe before words can burn." 
 
 " The heart must glow e'er the tongue can gild." 
 
 " There's a charm in delivery, a magical art, 
 
 That thrills, like a kiss, from the lip to the heart ; 
 
 Tis the glance, — the expression, — the well chosen word,— 
 
 By whose magic the depths of the spirit are stirred, — 
 
 The smile, — the mute gesture, — the soul stirring pause, — 
 
 The eye's sweet expression, that melts, while it awes, — 
 
 The lip's soft persuasion — its musical tone : 
 
 Oh ! such were the charms of that eloquent one ! "

ELOCUTION SIMPLIFIED. 
 
 Let it not be said that 
 
 ELOCUTION 
 
 Is only the tinsel of Eloquence. Demosthenes justty deemed 
 a correct delivery the very acme of the art, and devoted to its 
 acquirement years of toil and thousands of gold. Cicero ap- 
 plied himself to the cultivation of the vocal powers, under the 
 most eminent instructors with unwearied assiduity. Chatham 
 practiced before a mirror daily to the end of his life, to 
 acquire a free, graceful, and energetic action. Brougham 
 locked himself up for three weeks to the study of a single 
 oration, and wrote his peroration fifteen times. Robert Hall, 
 the prince of pulpit orators, was no less remarkable in his ear- 
 ly life, for his laborious culture of Elocution, than for his 
 profound philosophical investigations. Similar remarks might 
 be made of Chrysostom, Massillon, Whitefield, and all who 
 have distinguished themselves in the "art divine." Would we 
 realize their success, we must imitate their example. u He who 
 enters the arena of eloquence without cultivating his elocution, 
 has seized a sword for the contest, upon which he has put no 
 edge."

 if bursting a belt. 
 Second. Contract waist and expel breath. 
 
 VI. Expulsive Breathing. 
 
 First. Inhale through the nostrils. 
 
 Second. Expel through the mouth, as if whispering the 
 syllable hoo ! to a person at a distance. Give 
 out breath in a firm full column. 
 
 VII. Abrupt Breathing. 
 
 Catch breath quickly, through nostrils. 
 Emit air with sudden whisper — "hoo !" 
 
 VIII. Effusive Breathing. 
 Inhale a full breath. 
 Expel through open mouth. 
 Prolong the sound of the letter "h". 
 Make a gentle breathing murmur. 
 
 IX. Prolonged Breathing.

 X. Unequal Breathing. 
 
 Position. — Place the palm of the left hand, against the side, 
 close under the armpit. 
 
 Bend the right arm directly over head. 
 Practice deep breathing in this position. 
 Reverse this position of arm, and repeat. 
 
 Note. The foregoing exercises should he practiced often, as it is impossible to 
 secure ease and clearness of speech, without proper breathing. 
 
 ARTICULATION, 
 
 Good or bad, is the utterance of the Oral Elements. 
 
 Oral Elements are the sounds that form syllables. 
 
 Oral Elements are Produced by the voice and breath coming 
 in contact with the Organs of Speech. 
 
 The Principal Organs or Speech are the lips, teeth, tongue, 
 and palate. 
 
 ! Tonic Sounds. 
 Aspirate Sounds. 
 Combined Sounds. 
 
 Tonic Sounds are those produced by the voice. 
 
 Aspirate Sounds are those produced by the breath. 
 
 Combined Sounds are those produced by both voice and breath.

 Vowels. 
 
 Letters 
 
 Consonants. 
 
 Vowels are letters ivhich stand for the open sounds of the 
 human voice. They give audibility. 
 
 A Diphthong is the union of two vowels in one syllable; as, 
 ow, in hoi*se. 
 
 A Digraph is the union of two vowels in one syllable, one of 
 which is silent; as, oa, in toast. 
 
 A Triphthong is the union of three vowels in one syllable; 
 as, ieu, in adi'ew. 
 
 Consonants are the letters which stand for the sounds made 
 by the obstructed voice and the obstructed breath. They produce 
 discrimination. 
 
 Dentals are the letters whose sounds are chiefly formed by the 
 teeth. They are s, z, j, ch and sh.

 Linguals are the letters ivhose sounds are chiefly formed by 
 the tongue. They are d, I, r, and t. 
 
 Palatals are the letters ivhose sounds are chiefly formed by 
 the palate. They are g and 7c. 
 
 Labials are the letters whose sounds are chiefly formed by the 
 lips. They are p, b, w and wh. 
 
 F, and v are labia-dentals ; m is a nasal-labial ; th is a lingua- 
 palatal ; n is a nasal Lingual ; ng is a nasal-palatal. 
 
 Cognates a?*e £7ie letters whose sounds are produced by the 
 same organs of speech; thus ft is a cognate of g, and/ of v. 
 
 Equivalents are letters, or combinations of letters, that rep- 
 resent the same element or sound. I is an equivalent of e in 
 machine.

 19. The Boot Blacks. 
 
 A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two little bootblacks, 
 one white and one black, were standing at the corners doing nothing, 
 when the white bootblack agreed to black the black bootblack's boots. 
 The black bootblack was, of course, willing to have his boots blacked 
 by his fellow bootblack, and the bootblack who had agreed to black 
 the black bootblack's boots went to work. 
 
 When the bootblack had blacked one of the black bootblack's boots 
 till it shone in a manner that would make any bootblack proud, this 
 bootblack who had agreed to black the black bootblack's boots refus- 
 ed to black the other boot of the black bootblack until the black boot- 
 black, who had consented to have the white bootblack black his boots 
 should add five cents to the amount the white bootblack had made 
 blacking other men's boots. This the bootblack whose boot had been 
 blacked refused to do, saying it was good enough for a black boot- 
 black to have one boot blacked, and he didn't care whether the boot 
 that the white bootblack hadn't blacked was blacked or not. 
 
 This made the bootblack who had blacked the black bootblack's 
 boot as angry as a bootblack often gets, and he vented his black wrath 
 by spitting upon the blacked boot of the black bootblack. This raised 
 the latent passions of the black bootblack, and he proceeded to boot 
 the white bootblack with the boot which the white bootblack had 
 blacked. A fight ensued, in which the white bootblack who had re- 
 fused to black the unblacked boot of the black bootblack blacked the 
 black bootblack's visionary organ, and in which the black bootblack 
 wore all the blacking off his blacked boot in booting the white boot- 
 black.

 Shoemaker. Shoes Sewed, Soled Superfinely." 
 
 Simon's spry, sedulous spouse, Sally Short, sewed shirts, stitched 
 sheets, stuffed sofas. Simon's six stout sturdy sons, — Seth, Samuel,

 Stephen sold silks, satins, shawls ; Skeptical Saul sold silver salvers, 
 silver spoons; Selfish Shadrach sold shoestrings, soaps, saws, skates; 
 Slack Silas sold Sally Short's stuffed sofas. 
 
 Some seven summers since, Simon's second son, Samuel, saw Sophia 
 Sophronia Spriggs somewhere. Sweet, sensible, smart, Sophia So- 
 phronia Spriggs. Sam soon showed strange symptoms. Sam seldom 
 stayed storing, selling saddles. Sam sighed sorrowfully, sought 
 Sophia Sophronia's society, sang several serenades slily. Simon 
 stormed, scolded severely, said Sam seemed so silly, singing such 
 shameful, senseless songs. 
 
 u Strange Sam should slight such splendid summer sales," said Si- 
 mon. "Strutting spend-thrif t ! Scatter-brained simpleton!" 
 
 "Softly, softly, sire," said Sally, "Sam's smitten — Sam's spied 
 sweetheart." 
 
 "Sentimental schoolboy!" snarled Simon; "Smitten! Stop such 
 stuff!" 
 
 Simon sent Sally's snuff-box spinning, seized Sally's scissors, 
 smashed Sally's spectacles, scattering several spools. 
 
 "Snarling scoundrel! Sam's shocking silence shall surcease!" 
 Scowling Simon stopped speaking, starting swiftly shopward. Sally 
 sighed sadly. Summoning Sam she spoke sweet sympathy. 
 
 "Sam," said she, "sire seems singularly snappish; so sonny, stop 
 strolling sidewalks, stop smoking segars, spending specia superflu- 
 ously ; stop sprucing so ; stop singing serenades — stop short ; sell sad- 
 dles, sonny ; sell saddles sensibly ; see Sophia Sophronia Spriggs soon ; 
 she's sprightly, she's staple, so solicit, sure ; so secure Sophia speedily, 
 Sam." 
 
 "So soon; so soon?" said Sam, standing stock still. "So soon! 
 surely," said Sally, smiling, specially since sire shows such spirit." 
 
 So Sam somewhat scared, sauntered slowly, shaking stupendously.

 Sam soliloquizes : " Sophia Sophronia Spriggs Short — Sophia Sophro- 
 nia Sprigs Short — Sophia Sophronia Short, Samuel Short's spouse — 
 sounds splendid! Suppose she should say, she shan't?" 
 
 Soon Sam spied Sophia starching shirts, singing softly. Seeing 
 Sam she stopped starching ; saluted Sam smilingly ; Sam stammered 
 shockingly. 
 
 "Sp-sp-splendid summer season, Sophia." 
 
 "Somewhat sultry," suggested Sophia. 
 
 "Sar-sartin, Sophia," said Sam. {Silence seventeen seconds.) 
 
 "Selling saddles still, Sam?" 
 
 u Sar-sar-sartin," said Sam, starting suddenly. 
 
 "Season's somewhat soporific," said Sam steadily staunching stream- 
 ing sweat, shaking sensibly. 
 
 "Sartin," said Sophia, smiling significantly. 
 
 "Sip some sweet sherbet, Sam." {Silence sixty seconds.) 
 
 "Sire shot sixty sheldrakes, Saturday," said Sophia. 
 
 "Sixty? sho!" said Sam. {Silence seventy-seven seconds.) 
 
 "See sister Susan's sunflowers," said Sophia, sociably scattering 
 such stiff silence. 
 
 Sophia's sprightly sauciness stimulated Sam strangely; so Sam 
 suddenly spoke sentimentally: "Sophia, Susan's sunflowers seem 
 saying, Samuel Short, Sophia Sophronia Spriggs, stroll serenely, 
 seek some sequestered spot, some sylvan shade. Sparkling spring 
 shall sing soul-stirring strains ; sweet songsters shall silence secret 
 sighing ; super-angelic sylphs shall" — 
 
 Sophia snickered : so Sam stopped. 
 
 "Sophia," said Sam, solemnly. 
 
 "Sam," said Sophia. 
 
 "Sophia, stop smiling. Sam Short's sincere. Sam's seeking some 
 sweet spouse, Sophia." 
 
 "Speak, Sophia, speak! Such suspense speculates sorrow." 
 
 "Seek sire, Sam; seek sire." 
 
 So Sam sought sire Spriggs. Sire Spriggs said, "Sartin."

 And a song of regret from the bird on its wing ; 
 There's a pall on the sunshine and over the flowers, 
 And a shadoAV of graves on these spirits of ours ; 
 For a star hath gone down from the night of our sky, 
 
 On whose brightness we gazed as the war cloud rolled by ; 
 So tranquil and steady and clear were its beams, 
 That they fell like a vision of peace on our dreams.

 Why stand we here idle ? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be

 the existence of a power infinitely superior to that of any finite being ? 
 
 THE FALLING INFLECTION

 so he flourisheth ; For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone ; and 
 the place thereof shall know it no more. 
 
 EXPULSIVE FORM 
 
 Is a heavy tone used in great emotion and determination . 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Why not reform? That's easily said; 
 
 But I've gone through such wretched treatment, 
 Sometimes forgetting the taste of bread, 
 
 And scarce remembering what meat meant, 
 That my poor stomach's past reform ; 
 
 And there are times, wiien mad with thinking, 
 I'd sell out heaven for something warm 
 
 To prop a horrible inward sinking. 
 
 2. Sir, the declaration will inspire the people with increased cour- 
 age. Instead of a long and bloody war for restoration of privileges, 
 for redress of grievances, for chartered immunities, held under a 
 British king, set before them the glorious object of entire independ- 
 ence and it will breathe into them anew the breath of life. Read this 
 declaration at the head of the army ; every sword will be drawn from 
 its scabbard, and the solemn vow uttered, to maintain it or perish on 
 the bed of honor. Publish it from the pulpit ; Religion will approve

 field of Bunker Hill and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, — 
 and the very walls will cry out in its support. 
 
 EXPLOSIVE FORM 
 
 Is a heavy tone employed in command, grand description and 
 impressioned language. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. I saw the corse, the mangled corse 
 And then I cried for vengeance ! 
 Eouse, ye Romans ! rouse ye slaves ! 
 Have ye brave sons ? Look in the next fierce brawl 
 To see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look 
 To see them live, torn from your arms, disdained, 
 Dishonored ; and if ye dare call for justice, 
 Be answered by the lash !

 and they make the most of it. You can see it and almost feel it in 
 their presence. On all occasions it is produced, till it is worn as thin

 1. The storm o'er the ocean new furious and fast, 
 And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blast. 
 And heavny labored the gale-beaten ship, 
 
 Like a stout-hearted swimmer, the spray at his lip ; 
 And dark was the sky o'er the mariner's path, 
 Save when the wild lightning illumined in wrath. 
 
 2. My brethren, let us no longer live to ourselves. Let us arise 
 and put our hands to the great work in which the nations are now 
 moving. Wondrous things are taking place in the four quarters of 
 the globe. The world is waking up after a long sleep, and is teem- 
 ing with projects and efforts to extend the empire of truth and hap- 
 piness. This is the day of which the prophets sung. Let us not sleep, 
 while others are rousing themselves to action. Let every soul come 
 up to the help of the Lord. Let not one be left behind. He that 
 hath absolutely nothing to give, let him pray. Let no one be idle. 
 This is a great day and the Lord requires every hand in the work.

 God hath His mysteries of grace, — 
 
 Ways that we cannot tell. 
 
 And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, 
 On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door ; 
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, 
 And the lamplight o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on the

 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
 Shall be lifted— NEVERMORE !

 Woods and cornfields a little brown, 
 The picture must not be over bright 
 Yet all in the golden and gracious light 
 Of a cloud when the summer sun is down. 
 
 2. To make men patriots, to make men Christians, to make men 
 the sons of God, let all the doors of heaven be opened, and let God 
 drop down charmed gifts — winged imaginations, all piercing reason, 
 and all judging reason. Whatever there is that can make men wiser

 Proud wealth has no pleasure, I trow,

 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 And by opposing, end them?

 for, as no man who knows my motives dare now vindicate them, let 
 no prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let them and me repose in

 To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield 
 To Christian intercessors. 
 
 THOROUGH STRESS

 Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door ; 
 Whose days are dwindled to the shortest span : 
 
 Oh ! give relief and heaven will bless your store.

 SLUR 
 
 Is that rapid, smooth- gliding, subdued movement of the voice, which 
 is placed on parenthetical clauses. 
 
 When the parenthetical clause is placed in the middle of a

 For further practice in Gesticulation, the following most excellent 
 piece is furnished, which should be committed to memory and prac- 
 ticed until proper gesture becomes natural. 
 
 THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
 
 By Joseph B. Drake. 
 
 1. When Freedom, from her mountain height, 
 
 Unfurled her standard to the air, 
 She tore the azure robe of night, 
 
 And set the stars of glory there ! 
 She mingled with its gorgeous dyes 
 The milky baldric of the skies, 
 And striped its pure celestial white 
 With streakings of the morning light ; 
 Then, from his mansion in the sun, 
 She called her eagle-bearer down, 
 And gave into his mighty hand 
 The symbol of her chosen land ! 
 
 2. Majestic monarch of the cloud ! 
 
 Who reare'st aloft thy regal form, 
 To hear the tempest trumpings loud, 
 And see the lightning-lances driven, 
 
 When strive the warriors of the storm, 
 And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven ! 
 Child of the sun ! to thee 'tis given 
 
 To guard the banner of the free, 
 To hover in the sulphur smoke, 
 To ward away the battle-stroke, 
 And bid its blendings shine afar, 
 Like rainbows on the cloud of war — 
 
 The harbingers of victory !

 3. Flag of the brave, thy folds shall fly, 
 The sign of hope and triumph high. 
 When speaks the signal trumpet tone, 
 And the long line comes glimmering on — 
 Ere yet the life-blood warm and wet, 
 Has dimmed the glistening bayonet — 
 Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn 
 
 To where the sky-born glories burn ; 
 And, as his springing steps advance, 
 Catch war and vengeance from the glance ! 
 And when the cannon-mouthings loud 
 Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud, 
 And gory sabers rise and fall, 
 Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall ; 
 Then shall thy meteor glances glow, 
 
 And cowering foes shall sink beneath 
 Each gallant arm that strikes below 
 
 That lovely messenger of death. 
 
 4. Flag of the seas ! on ocean wave 
 Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave, 
 When Death, careering on the gale, 
 Sweeps darkly 'round the bellied sail, 
 And frighted waves rush wildly back, 
 Before the broadside's reeling rack ; 
 Each dying wanderer of the sea 
 Shall look at once to heaven and thee, 
 And smile to see thy splendors fly, 
 
 In triumph o'er his closing eye. 
 
 5. Flag of the free heart's hope and home, 
 
 By angel hands to valor given ! 
 Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, 
 
 And all thy hues were born in heaven. 
 Forever float that standard sheet ! 
 
 Where breathes the foe but falls before us, 
 With Freedom's soil beneath our feet, 
 
 And Freedom's banner streaming over us?

 DIRECTNESS 
 
 Is the plain, simple address that we unconsciously employ ivhen en- 
 deavoring to convince. 
 
 Use your own direct way of expression, as if the thoughts 
 had just been suggested to your own mind. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Young men, Ahoy ! the rapids are below you. 
 
 2. Treat every man as a gentleman, until he has proven himself 
 
 otherwise. 
 
 3. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's 
 
 censure but reserve thy judgment. 
 
 4. Fellow citizens, you stand here like giants as you are. 
 
 5. I cannot, my lords, I will not join in congratulation on misfortune 
 
 and disgrace. 
 
 6. Friends, Eomans, countrymen ! lend me your ears. I come to 
 
 bury Caesar, not to praise him. 
 
 7. This is a case, gentlemen of the jury, in which the plaintiff is a 
 
 widow 5 yes, gentlemen of the jury, a widow. 
 
 8. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself are much condemned to 
 
 have an itching palm, to sell and mart your offices for gold 
 to unde servers. 
 
 9. I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in view 
 
 the prosperity and honor of the wdiole country, and the pres- 
 ervation of the Federal Union. 
 
 10. My brave associates, partners of my toil, my feelings, and my 
 
 fame, can Holla's w T ords add vigor to the virtuous energies 
 that now inspire your hearts ?

 EXPRESSION 
 
 Is the utterance of thought or feeling ivith such force as to convey it 
 in the clearest and most pleasing manner. 
 
 It is most necessaiy, to employ correct expression, to feel 
 that which you wish to express, — to have clear ideas concern- 
 ing what you read or speak. Dr. H. W. Beecher says on this 
 subject, "Fill yourself chock full of the subject; then pull out 
 the bung, and let nature caper." 
 
 The student should not try to imitate the expression of oth- 
 ers, but use his own natural style. 
 
 u To paint the passion's force, and paint it well 
 The proper action nature's self will tell." 
 
 EXAMPLE. 
 
 Henry says he will start to Springfield next Monday. 
 [Practice the above sentence as directed below.] 
 
 1. Place emphasis on Henry as if answering question, u Who says etc." 
 
 2. Emphasize successively every w^ord in the sentence. 
 
 3. Give it every variety of affirmation, negation, and interrogation. 
 
 4. Give it as if speaking to a person at a distance. 
 
 5. Give it in a pleasant tone and manner. 
 
 6. Give it in a sullen tone and manner. 
 
 7. Give it in a careless sleepy tone and manner. 
 
 8. Give it in an excited tone and manner. 
 
 9. Give it in an ironical tone and manner. 
 
 10. Give it in a respectful tone and manner. 
 
 11. Give it in a serious tone and manner. 
 
 12. Give it in a merry tone and manner. 
 
 Note. The Facial Expression and action should correspond with the tone of 
 voice.

 ANTITHESIS 
 
 Is the placing of words in contrast to heighten their effect. 
 There should be a pause after the antithetic words, in nearly 
 all cases. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. The righteous shall enter into everlasting joy, but the wicked 
 into everlasting punishment. 
 
 2. I do not tremble when I meet 
 The stoutest of my foes ; 
 But heaven defend me from the friend 
 Who comes and never goes. 
 
 3. The cottage was a thatched one, 
 The outside old and mean, 
 But all within that little cot 
 Was wondrous neat and clean. 
 
 4. A liar begins by making a falsehood appear like truth, and ends 
 by making a truth appear like falsehood. 
 
 5. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say 
 here ; but it can never forget what they did here. 
 
 6. If the blaze of Dryden's fire is brighter, the heat of Pope's is 
 more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and 
 Pope never falls below it. 
 
 EXCLAMATION 
 
 Is the words employed to express strong emotion, feeling or passion. 
 
 1. Hence ! home, ye idle creatures — get ye gone ! 
 
 2. Hush ! — Hark ! — a deep sound strikes like a rising knell. 
 
 3. Praise ye the Lord ! The Lord's name be praised !

 4. Now for the fight ! forward through blood and smoke ! 
 
 5. Clarence has come ! false ! fleeting ! perjured Clarence ! 
 
 6. Great heaven ! how frail thy creature man is made ! 
 How by himself insensibly betrayed ! 
 
 7. They're gone ! they're gone ! the glimmering spark hath fled, 
 The wife and child are numbered with the dead ! 
 
 8. It is my living sentiment and, by the blessing of God, it shall 
 be my dying sentiment ! — independence now, and independence for- 
 ever ! ! 
 
 EMPHATIC REPETITION 
 
 Is the increased expression of repeated words. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Arm, warriors ! ARM for the fight ! 
 
 2. Down ! down ! cries Mar, your lances DOWN ! 
 
 3. You com not, my Lords, you can not conquer America. 
 
 4. To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek! 
 
 5. This long line passes in solemn array, and lifting up its face to 
 God, cries out, avenge ! avenge ! ! AVENGE ! ! ! 
 
 6. If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign 
 troop remained in my country, I never would lay down my arms — 
 never, never, NEVER. 
 
 IRONY 
 
 Is the pronouncing of words in such a manner as to convey a mean- 
 ing directly opposite to that implied by the language. 
 
 Irony may vaiy in expression from the just perceptible tone 
 to the tone of intense bitterness. 
 
 1. Your consul's merciful — for this all thanks : 
 He dares not touch a hair of Catiline !

 2. O masters ! if I were disposed to stir 
 
 Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, 
 I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong ; 
 Who, you all know, are honorable men. 
 I will not do them wrong ; I rather choose 
 To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you, 
 Than I will wrong such honorable men. 
 
 3. They boast they come but to improve our state, enlarge our 
 thoughts, and free us from the yoke of error ! Yes, they will give 
 enlightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves the slaves of 
 passion, avarice and pride. Yes, they offer us their protection as vul- 
 tures give to lambs — covering and devouring them. 
 
 4. "But, -Mr. Speaker, we have a right to tax America." Oh, won- 
 derful, transcendent right ! the assertion of which has cost this coun- 
 try thirteen provinces, six islands, one hundred thousand lives ; and 
 seventy millions of money. Oh, invaluable right! for the sake of 
 which we have sacrificed our right among nations, our importance 
 abroad, and our happiness at home ! Oh, right ! more dear to us than 
 our existence ! which has already cost us so much, and which seems 
 likely to cost us our all. 
 
 APOSTROPHE 
 
 Is a turning away from a real auditor or audience and addressing 
 an absent or imaginary one. 
 
 Practice as if the object or thing addressed were a person. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. O happiness ! our being's end and aim, 
 
 Good, pleasure, ease, content — whate'er thy name ; 
 That something still which prompts the eternal sigh, 
 For which we fear to live and dare to die ; 
 Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies ; 
 O'erlook'd, seen double, by the fool and wise ;

 Plant of celestial seed ! if dropp'd below, 
 Say in what mortal soil thon deign'st to grow? 
 
 2. Roll on, thou dark and deep blue ocean, roll ! 
 Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain. 
 Man marks the earth with ruin — his control 
 Stops with the shore ; upon the watery plain 
 The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain 
 A shadow of men's ravage, save his own, 
 When, for a moment, like a drop of rain, 
 He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan, 
 Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffln'd and unknown. 
 
 INTERROGATION 
 
 Is the ashing of a question for the purpose of asserting the reverse 
 of what is asked. 
 
 Often, in impassioned discourse, men naturally express what 
 they would affirm or deny in interrogation. 
 
 Assume the proper spirit of the piece, give it an appropriate 
 tone and action and pause at the end of the question, as if you 
 waited an answer. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 1. Who would be a traitor knave? 
 Who would till a coward's grave? 
 Who so base as be a slave? 
 Traitor ! Coward ! turn and flee ! 
 
 2. To purchase heaven, has gold the power? 
 Can gold remove the mortal hour? 
 
 In life can love be bought with gold? 
 Are friendship's treasures to be sold? 
 
 3. Our brethren are already in the field. Why stand we here idle? 
 What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have ? Is life so 
 dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and 
 slavery?

 4. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak!

 Koman? If any, speak! for him have I offended. Who is here so vile 
 that will not love his country? If any, speak! for him have I offend- 
 ed. None ! then none have I offended. 
 
 5. And shall we think of ratifying* the acts of Charles, yet abolish 
 his laws ? Those laws which he in our sight repeated, pronounced, 
 enacted ? Laws which he valued himself on passing ? Laws in which 
 he thought the system of our government was comprehended ? Laws 
 which govern our provinces and our trials? Are we, I say, to repeal 
 such laws, yet ratify his acts ? 
 
 SOLILOQUY 
 
 Consists in the language of a person addressing himself. 
 The expression should indicate that the attention is directed 
 to thoughts within and not to things without. 
 
 EXA3IPLES. 
 
 1. Beautiful! 
 
 How beautiful is all this visible world ! 
 
 How glorious in its action and itself ! 
 
 But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we, 
 
 Half dust, half deity, alike unfit 
 
 To sink or soar — with our mixed essence, make 
 
 A conflict of its elements. 
 
 2. Oh, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven ! 
 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't — 
 
 A brother's murder. — Pray, alas ! I cannot, 
 Though inclination be as sharp as 'twill ; 
 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, 
 And like a man to double business bound, 
 I stand and pause where I shall first begin.

 PICTURING 
 
 Is the formation of ideas in the mind, concerning what ive would 
 
 read or speak. 
 
 No subject should elicit better attention than the one before 
 us. It is necessary that there be a mental picture concerning 
 what we would express. The sentiment of a piece should be 
 studied so well that the reader or speaker may have painted on 
 the canvas of his imagination all the circumstances which gave 
 rise to it. Thus and only thus may the Elocutionist make his 
 efforts impressive. 
 
 EXAMPLES. 
 
 The wind is high — the window shakes ; 
 With sudden start the miser wakes ! 
 Along the silent room he stalks ; 
 Looks hack and trembles as he walks ! 
 
 After the above lines are read questions may be asked in the follow- 
 ing manner. 
 
 1. Did you hear the window shake? 
 
 2. Could you see the miser as he awoke? 
 
 3. Did you see him walk across the room? 
 
 4. Was it a small or a large room? 
 
 5. Was the room silent? 
 
 6. Did the miser look back? 
 
 7. Did he have a firm step? 
 
 By thus exciting questions in the mind, a correct picture may be 
 drawn. 
 
 The following will afford excellent practice in picturing. 
 
 AN ORDER FOR A PICTURE. 
 
 By Alice Cary. 
 1. O, good painter, tell me true, 
 
 Has your hand the cunning to draw 
 Shapes of things that you never saw ? 
 Ay? Well, here is an order for you.

 Woods and cornfield a little brown, — 
 
 The picture must not be over-bright, 
 
 Yet all in the golden and gracious light, 
 Of a cloud when the summer sun is down. 
 
 2. Always and always, night and morn, 
 Woods upon woods, with fields of corn 
 
 Lying between them, not quite sere, 
 And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom ; 
 When the wind can hardly find breathing room 
 
 Under their tassels, — cattle near, 
 Biting shorter the short green grass, 
 And a hedge of sumach and sassafras, 
 With bluebirds twittering all around, — 
 Ah, good painter, you can't paint sound ! 
 
 3. These and the little house where I was born, 
 Low and little and black and old, 
 
 With children, many as it can hold, 
 All at the windows, open wide, — 
 Heads and shoulders clear outside, 
 And fair young faces all ablush ; 
 
 Perhaps you may have seen, some day, 
 
 Roses crowding the selfsame way, 
 Out of a wilding, wayside bush. 
 
 4. Listen closer. When you have done 
 
 With woods and cornfields and grazing herds, 
 A lady, the loveliest ever the sun 
 Looked down upon, you must paint for me ; 
 Oh, if I only could make you see 
 
 The clear blue eyes, the tender smile, 
 The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace, 
 The woman's smile, and the angel's face 
 
 That are beaming on me all the while ! 
 
 I need not speak these foolish words : 
 Yet one word tells you all I would say, — 
 
 She is my mother ; you will agree 
 That all the rest may be thrown away.

 5. Two little urchins at her knee 
 You must paint, sir ; one like me, — 
 
 The other with a clearer brow, 
 And the light of his adventurous eyes 
 Flashed with boldest enterprise : 
 
 At ten years old he went to sea, — 
 God knoweth if he be living now, — 
 He sailed on the good ship "Commodore", — 
 
 Nobody ever crossed her track 
 
 To bring us news, and she never came back. 
 Ah, 'tis twenty long years and more 
 Since that old ship went out of the bay 
 
 With my greathearted brother on her deck : 
 
 I watched him till he shrank to a speck, 
 And his face was toward me all the way. 
 
 Bright his hair was, a golden brown, 
 The time we stood at our mother's knee ; 
 
 That beautiful head, if it did go down, 
 Carried sunshine into the sea ! 
 
 6. Out in the fields one summer night 
 
 We were together, half afraid 
 
 Of the corn-leaves rustling, and of the shade 
 Of the high hills, stretching so still and far, — 
 
 Loitering till after the low little light 
 
 Of the candle shone through the open door, 
 And, over the haystack's pointed top, 
 All of a tremble and ready to drop 
 
 The first half -hour, the great yellow star 
 That we, with staring, ignorant eyes, 
 
 Had often and often watched to see 
 Propped and held to its place in the skies 
 By the fork of a tall mulberry tree, 
 
 WTiich close in the edge of our flax-field grew, — 
 Dead at the top,— just one branch full 
 Of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool, 
 
 From which it tenderly shook the dew 
 Over our heads, when we came to play 
 In its handbreadth of shadow, day after day, 
 Afraid to go home, sir ; for one of us bore 
 
 A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs, —

 The other, a bird, held fast by the legs, 
 Not so big as a straw of wheat : 
 The berries we gave her she would not eat, 
 But cried and cried, till we held her bill, 
 So slim and shining to keep her still. 
 
 7. At last we stood at our mother's knee. 
 
 Do you think, sir, if you try, 
 You can paint the look of a lie ? 
 
 If you can, pray have the grace 
 
 To put it solely in the face 
 Of the urchin that is likest me ; 
 I think 'twas solely mine, indeed : 
 But that's no matter, — paint it so ; 
 
 The eyes of our mother — (take good heed) — 
 
 Looking not on the nest-full of eggs, 
 Nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs, 
 But straight through our faces, down to our lies, 
 And oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise, 
 I felt my heart bleed where that glance went as though 
 A sharp blade struck through it. 
 
 8. You, sir, know, 
 That you on the canvas are to repeat 
 Things that are fairest, things most sweet, — 
 Woods and cornfields and mulberry tree, — 
 
 The mother, — the lads, with their birds at her knee ; 
 
 But, oh, that look of reproachful woe ! 
 High as the heavens your name I'll shout, 
 If you paint me the picture and leave that out. 
 
 TRANSITION

 EXAMPLES. 
 1. 
 
 Natural, From the chamber, clothed in white, 
 
 The bride came forth on her wedding night ; 
 Low. There in that silent room below, 
 
 The dead lay in his shroud of snow. 
 2. 
 Effusive. The day is cold, and dark, and dreary ; 
 
 It rains, and the wind is never weary. 
 Expulsive. Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France, 
 
 Charge for the golden lilies — upon them with the lance ! 
 Explosive. Quick ! quick ! brave spirits, to his rescue fly ; 
 
 Up! Up! by Heavens ! This hero must not die ! 
 3. 
 Natural. Has your hand the cunning to draw 
 
 Shapes of things that you never saw ? 
 Slow. When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, 
 
 The line, too, labors, and the words move slow ; 
 Fast. Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain, 
 
 Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the plain. 
 
 4. 
 Orotund. By Nebo's lonely mountain, 
 
 On this side Jordan's wave, 
 
 In a vale in the land of Moab, 
 
 There lies a lonely grave. 
 Tremulous. Pity the sorrows of a poor old man, 
 
 Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door ; 
 
 Whose days are dwindled to the shortest span ; 
 
 Oh, give relief ! and heaven will bless your store. 
 Subdued. Soft is the strain when zephyrs gently blow, 
 
 And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flow ; 
 High. But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, 
 
 The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar. 
 
 Aspirate. Hush ! hark! did stealing steps go by? 
 
 Came not faint whispers near? 
 Simple Pure. No ! — The wild wind hath many a sigh 
 
 Amid the foliage sere.

 When the sun shines out like a gay young lover 
 Low. But Mona's waters are dark as night 
 
 When the face of heaven is clouded over. 
 
 7. 
 Slow. The sun hath set in folded clouds, 
 
 Its twilight rays are gone ; 
 Low. And gathered in the shades of night 
 
 The storm is rolling on. 
 Effusive. Alas how ill that bursting storm 
 
 The fainting spirit braves, 
 
 When they, the lovely and the lost, 
 
 Are gone to early graves ! 
 
 8. 
 Gradually. How soft the music of those village bells, 
 Softer. Falling at intervals upon the ear 
 
 In cadence sweet ! now dying all away, 
 Gradually. Now pealing loud again, and louder still, 
 Louder. Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on. 
 
 9. 
 Natural. I hear them marching o'er the hill, 
 Monotone. I hear them fainter, fainter still ! 
 
 I hear them inarching o'er the hill, 
 
 I hear them fainter, fainter still ! 
 High. They stole, they stole, they stole my child away. 
 
 Monotone. They stole, they stole, they stole my child away ! 
 
 10. 
 Heavy. The combats deepen. On, ye brave, 
 
 Who rush to glory, or the grave ! 
 Subdued. Ah ! few shall part where many meet ! 
 
 The snow shall be their winding sheet, 
 
 And every turf beneath their feet 
 
 Shall be a soldier's sepulchre. 
 
 11. 
 Sim. Pure. A thousand hearts beat happily; and when 
 Music arose with its voluptuous swell, 
 Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again, 
 And all went merry as a marriage-bell ; — 
 Aspirate. But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell !

 Effusive. Father of earth and heaven ! I call thy name !

 Forward — through blood and cloud and toil and fire !

 Lower. Of dying day 
 
 Sinks deeper down and fades away. 
 Gradually. A faint light gleams 
 Louder. A light that seems 
 
 To grow and grow till nature teems. 
 14. 
 Explosive. Eise ! rise ! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight ! 
 Effusive. 'Tis finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors, 
 
 Culloden is lost, and my country deplores. 
 Explosive. The double, double, double beat 
 
 Of the thundering drum, 
 
 Loud. Cries, Hark ! the foes come ; 
 
 Very Loud. Charge, charge ! 'tis too late to retreat. 
 
 Effusive. The soft complaining flute, 
 
 In dying notes discovers 
 
 The woes of hapless lovers ; 
 
 Whose dirge is whispered by the warbling lute. 
 15. 
 Sim. Pure. But gentler now the small waves glide 
 
 Like playful lambs o'er the mountain's side, 
 Orotund. So stately her bearing, so proud her array, 
 
 The main she will traverse forever and aye. 
 
 Many ports will exult at the gleam of her mast ! 
 Aspirate. Hush ! hush ! thou vain dreamer ! this hour is the last. 
 
 16. 
 Gradually. Ever, as on they bore, more loud, 
 Louder. And louder rang the pibrock proud, 
 
 Gradually. At first the sound, by distance tame, 
 31ore Mellowed, along the waters came : 
 
 Gentle. And lingering long by cape and bay, 
 
 Wailed every harsher note away ; 
 
 Loud. When bursting bolder on the ear, 
 
 The clan's shrill gathering they could hear, — 
 Those thrilling sounds, that call the night 
 Of old Clan- Alpine to the fight.

 I had stood on the bridge at midnight 
 And gazed on that wave and sky.

 When immediately followed b} r a vowel sound, U R" may be 
 trilled in light description, Impersonation and Imitative Modu-

 us more than her grandest displays of material power. Her mightiest 
 operations are performed in silence, and the effect is deepened and in- 
 tensified by the sense of a greater power behind that which we see or 
 feel. 
 
 Art, too, touches us with its reserved power. There are paintings 
 whose meaning lies on the surface and is exhausted by a single look ; 
 and there are others which disappoint at first, yet, reverently studied, 
 gradually glow with beauty, disclosing new marvels of skill, and 
 hidden depths of meaning at each examination, till at last the genius 
 of the artist stands confessed, and you gaze transfixed as by a mighty 
 enchanter. 
 
 Indeed, power exerted, however great, never impresses us in the 
 profoundest degree, unless we feel that behind it there is a power 
 greater than itself, by which it can be at any moment augmented. 
 The force that is exhausted in a single effort inspires but a limited 
 degree of admiration. 
 
 It has been truly said that the great orator is not he who ex- 
 hausts his subject and himself at every effort, but he whose expres- 
 sions suggest a region of thought, a dim vista of imagery, an oceanic 
 depth of feeling, beyond what is compassed by his sentences. 
 
 IMITATIVE MODULATION 
 
 Is the imitation of things by sound. 
 
 Nothing acids more to impressive speech than the p\ay upon 
 words. The sound should correspond to the sense, to have 
 proper effect. In speaking of the howling of a dog ; the roaring 
 of a storm ; the buzz of a bee ; the crawling of a snail or the hiss

 Two craggy rocks projecting to the main, 
 The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain ; 
 Within, the waves in softer murmurs glide, 
 And ships secure without their halsers ride. 
 
 13. Language Compared to an Organ.

 ODE ON THE PASSIONS. 
 
 By William Collins. 
 
 When Music, heavenly maid, was young, 
 While yet in early Greece she sung, 
 The Passions 6ft, to hear her shell, 
 Thronged around her magic cell, — 
 Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,— 
 Possessed beyond the Muse's painting ; 
 By turns they felt the glowing mind 
 Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined : 
 Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired, 
 Filled with fury, rapt, inspired, 
 From the supporting myrtles round 
 They snatched her instruments of sound ; 
 And, as they oft had heard apart 
 Sweet lessons of her forceful art, 
 Each — for Madness ruled the hour — 
 Would prove his own expressive power.

 First Fear , his hand, its skill to try, 
 Amid the chords bewildered laid ; 
 
 And back recoiled, he knew not why, 
 E'en at the sound himself had made. — 
 
 Next Anger rushed — his eyes on fire, 
 
 In lightnings owned his secret stings : 
 In one rude clash he struck the lyre, 
 
 And swept, with hurried hands, the strings. — 
 
 AY i tli woful measures, wan Despair — 
 
 Low sullen sounds !— his grief beguiled ; 
 A solemn, strange, and mingled air; 
 
 Twas sad, by fits — by starts, 'twas wild. 
 
 But thou, O Hope ! with eyes so fair — 
 
 What was thy delighted measure? 
 
 Still it whispered promised pleasure, 
 And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail ! 
 
 Still would her touch the strain prolong; 
 And, from the rocks, the woods, the vale, 
 
 She called on Echo still, through all her song ; 
 And where her sweetest theme she chose, 
 
 A soft responsive voice was heard at every close ; 
 And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair. 
 
 And longer had she sung — but, with a frown, 
 
 Eevenge impatient rose. 
 He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down ; 
 
 And, with a withering look, 
 
 The war-denouncing trumpet took, 
 And blew a blast so loud and dread, 
 Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woes ; 
 
 And ever and anon he beat 
 
 The doubling drum with furious heat ; 
 And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,

 Her soul-subduing voice applied, 
 Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien ; 
 While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his

 Thy numbers, Jealousy, to naught were fixed — 
 
 Sad proof of thy distressful state ! 
 Of differing themes the veering song was mixed ; 
 And now it courted Love— now, raving called on Hate. 
 With eyes upraised, as one inspired, 
 Pale Melancholy sat retired ; 
 And, from her wild, sequestered seat, 
 In notes by distance, made more sweet, 
 Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul ; 
 And, dashing soft from rocks around, 
 Bubbling runnels joined the sound; 
 Through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole ; 
 Or, o'er some haunted streams, with fond delay, — 
 Pound a holy calm diffusing, 
 Love of peace, and lonely musing, — 
 In hollow murmurs died away. 
 
 But oh ! how altered was its sprightlier tone, 
 
 When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue, 
 Her bow across her shoulder flung, 
 Her buskins gemmed with morning dew 
 
 Blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket rung. 
 The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known ! 
 
 The oak-crowned sisters, and their chaste-eyed queen, 
 Satyrs, and sylvan boys, were seen, 
 Peeping from forth their alleys green ; 
 Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear; 
 And Sport leaped up, and seized his beechen spear.

 Last came Joy's ecstatic trial : 
 He, with viny crown, advancing, 
 First to the lively pipe his hand addressed ; 
 
 But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol, 
 Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best. 
 They would have thought, who heard the strain, 
 They saw in Tempe's vale, her native maids, 
 Amid the festal-sounding shades, 
 To some unwearied minstrel dancing ; 
 While, as his flying lingers kissed the strings, 
 Love framed with Mirth a gay, fantastic round — 
 Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound ; 
 And he, amid his frolic play, 
 As if he would the charming air repay, 
 Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings. 
 
 CALISTHENICS 
 
 Are gymnastic exercises for the cultivation of physical strength 
 and free and graceful movement. 
 
 Calisthenics were held in high esteem by the ancient Greeks 
 and Romans. Muscular elasticity is highly necessary and even 
 indispensible to a proper production of tone. Muscular force 
 can only be acquired b} T frequent calisthenic drills. Much prac- 
 tice in the following exercises will make grace, strength, and 
 elasticity of body natural. 
 
 Avoid a feeble, unmeaning manner and enter into the exercise 
 with life and energy.
