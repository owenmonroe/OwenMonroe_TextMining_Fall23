PREFACE
AS Head of the Regent Street Polytechnic
School of Speech Training and Dramatic
Art, and as an adjudicator in speech at Musical
Festivals all over the British Isles, the late
Louie Bagley strove always to cherish our
mother-tongue as a great heritage, and to
show how the study of its oral expression
makes us artists : “painters of pictures in
sound.”

ELOCUTION
DO'S AND DONT'S
CHAPTER I
AN INQUIRY CONCERNING
ELOCUTION
THE English Association at their Annual
I Meeting in June, 1925, held a Conference
upon the Appeal of Literature to the Ear and
to the Eye. I do not propose to discuss here
the arguments brought forward nor the points
raised. Most of the speakers talked on the
outskirts of the subject; but one, who defi-
nitely recognized that if literature is to appeal
to the ear there must be adequate training in
speech on the part of the teacher or reader,
in the course of his remarks said : “I think
we all agree in loathing, not quite all, but the
majority of those people who call themselves
elocutionists.” Now, why was the speaker so
sure not only of the fact that he “loathed"
elocutionists, but that his audience would
agree with him ? In August of the same year
I attended a Conference at Oxford on Drama
in Schools, and the speaker who introduced the
subject said that “ the result of the teaching of
elocution in schools is frequently a nightmare.”
If I am to write a book on elocution and you

are going to read it-much more, if you intend
making a study of the subject-I think it may
be advisable to inquire why both these speakers
were justified, assuming for the time being
that they were justified, in passing such denun-
ciatory judgment upon the elocutionist and all
his works.
What exactly is elocution, and what does it
purport to teach ? According to its derivation,
elocution means “ To speak out.” To speak
out would appear to be a useful accomplishment
which is more conspicuous by its absence than
by its presence in the equipment of many whose
duties require them to address public audiences.
Elocution, however, from its early beginnings
has not been concerned merely with audi-
bility. We need not for the purpose of our
present study go further back than the middle
of the eighteenth century—the century which
saw the beginnings of the interest in books, and
particularly in books dealing with language
and literature. The old masters found, as
modern phoneticians have found, that there is
a cadence in the spoken language which can
alter entirely the meaning of a sentence.
“ Elocution is,” says Thomas Sheridan, " the
just and graceful management of the voice,
countenance, and gesture in speaking.”
Sheridan, Walker, and other early teachers and


## p. 3 (#13) ###############################################

INQUIRY CONCERNING ELOCUTION 3
writers noticed that these cadences and melodies
of speech which were present in conversation
were entirely lost in reading aloud, in public
speaking, in the speaking of verse. It is
interesting to note, however, that Sheridan
definitely recognized that the melody of the
voice in verse speaking should not be the same
as in conversational cadence. In order to
correct this monotony and general slovenliness
of speaking both in private and public, and at
the same time as a means of escape from teach-
ing by imitation, a system was devised whereby
the "correct "cadences could be applied by
rule to any composition, spoken or read.
It was here that elocution started to go
wrong: not because it is impossible to develop
the power of æsthetic expression in speech, but
because by such a system of rules the mind
is diverted from the matter to the manner.
That which should be chiefly mental became
wholly physical. As to that terrible word
“elocutionist," it is really entirely out of date.
It belongs to the age when a man who taught
English was called a grammarian. As a matter
of fact, in the eighteenth century the gram-
marian, elocutionist, philologist, and rheto-
rician were generally one and the same person.
Elocution at its best is the technique of the art
of interpretative speech, but the technique of


## p. 4 (#14) ###############################################

4 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
this and any other art is not merely training
in muscular control, essential as that is, it is
the training of the imagination through the
ear and the eye, and it is only by such training
that we become sensitive to sounds, colours,
and forms. In justice to the old elocution
masters it must be remembered that it was
impossible to teach an art which deals with the
most subjective form of æsthetic expression-
expression through the human personality-on
sound lines until the study of physiological
psychology had begun to yield up its secrets.
It involves a development and co-ordination of
the psycho-physical processes which even to-day
we are only faintly beginning to understand.
The science of asthetics, which may be
traced to the teaching of Baumgarten in the
seventeenth century, and which developed
through the teaching of Kant, is also of im-
mense value, because æsthetics teaches us
the principles of art, and knowledge of art
based upon principles is a different thing to a
knowledge based upon opinion.' Æsthetics
was an unknown science to Sheridan. It is
not surprising, therefore, that a subjective art,
of which the technical training must be based
upon the psychic and physiological laws of
man's being and on its subject-matter, and
must draw inspiration from all that is true

INQUIRY CONCERNING ELOCUTION 5
and beautiful in English language and litera-
ture, should have been involved in the past in
considerable confusion of thought.
But the nature of the problem is not realized
to-day even by those seeking to solve it. This
was evident from the remark of the chairman
at the Conference on the Appeal of Literature
to the Ear and to the Eye, who, when calling
upon a speaker to deal with the psychological
aspect of the question, said that for his part he
did "not think there was a psychological
aspect.”
It is not too much to say that the mistakes
made by the elocutionist in the past are not
greater than those which have been made
through ignorance or imperfect knowledge in
the teaching of social sciences, medical science,
surgery, religion, and even in the methods of
the education system itself. Indeed, if Thomas
Sheridan, the elocutionist, orthoepist and actor,
had been listened to by the educational
authorities in 1756, and again in the following
years, the Report on the Teaching of English,
published in 1922, would have been very
different in its findings; many of the recom-
mendations there laid down would have been
in force in England for over two hundred years.
Sheridan was himself a classic student, but he
recognized that even in those days English

was being sacrificed for the classics. It is
interesting to compare his "English Education”
and later “ Discourses" with our modern
Report on the Teaching of English. The title
is even longer than that of the modern report.
It runs: “ British Education, or the Source
of the Disorders of Great Britain, being an
Essay toward proving that Immorality, Ig-
norance, and False Taste which so generally
prevail are the Natural and Necessary Con-
sequences of the Present Defective System of
Education, with an Attempt to show that a
Revival of the Art of Speaking and the study
of our own language might contribute in a
great measure to the cure of those Evils.”
Now let us compare the two reports :

again the Report on the Teaching of English,
paragraphs 174, 175, 176), and that the
Universities should be provided with properly
qualified persons, and that “certain annual
salaries should be given to such men.” When
the Universities have been provided, the next
step is “ to spread their studies as speedily as
possible through the realm," and he recom-
mends“ the planting of able masters in the
several counties and principal towns of Great
Britain,” these masters also “to have fixed
salaries and for a stated period."
The specialist in spoken English has not yet,
in the majority of cases, attained to the position
of a “fixed salary and for a stated period,"
and certainly not to a pension !
Sheridan was the first great teacher of
elocution ; I think it is clear also that he was a
far-sighted educationist. It is true that he
followed Locke, who, in “Some Thoughts
Concerning Education,” published in 1690,
made a strong appeal for the teaching of
English, both written and spoken; but
Sheridan realized what Locke did not, that to
become a specialist in oral English study and
training are necessary. It is true that Mr.
Locke in his essay on Education grievously
complains of our negligence in studying our
mother tongue, but he lays the fault at the

wrong door when he imputes the neglect to
the masters of grammar schools and tutors at
the Universities. They have not had the
necessary training; they neither profess to
teach it nor know how to do so. Nothing
effectual can be done without making speech a
distinct branch of Education in English.
Sheridan certainly had that love of English,
and especially of the living spoken language,
which has been, I think it may be claimed, a
redeeming feature of all “ elocutionists,” how-
ever limited in some respects they may have
been. Sheridan was followed by Walker,
whose name is remembered to-day for his
dictionary rather than for his work on elocution.
Lindley Murray, a later elocutionist, again is
remembered for his grammar. In the writings
of all these old elocutionists we find that the
principles were right, the methods wrong.
“Nothing should be allowed to supersede
Nature. Let her, therefore, stand in the
foreground.” “The reader abuses his art who
betrays by his delivery that he enunciates by
rule”; “ Give the sense of what is read. Mind
is the thing"; these are all precepts which we
can endorse to-day.
We have to come to the early nineteenth
century before we find the rigid chains of
elocution methods firmly riveted, and those

10 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
NE
chains were forged not by an elocutionist
at all, but by a physiologist and medical man,
Dr. James Rush. Dr. Rush was an American
who travelled and studied extensively in Europe.
His great work, in two large volumes, was
“ An Analysis of Human Intellect,” which,
whatever its limitations, at the time of publi-
cation won the approval of the French Academy,
The inquiry connected with this work, as also
his studies in music, led Dr. Rush naturally to
the study of speech, and the result was “ The
Philosophy of the Human Voice, a System of
Principles by which Criticism in the Art of
Elocution may be rendered Intelligible and
Instruction Definite and Comprehensive.” The
work appeared in 1827 and the sixth edition
in 1867. It is an important looking volume,
and, like the“ Analysis of the Human Intellect,”
is an attempt to find a physical cause for all
mental or spiritual phenomena. He says :
“Nor is the vulgar idea of the expression of
speech very different. The Physical as well as
the Oratorical school has always been possessed
with the notion that the tones of the voice are
the result of an indescribable occult quality
or metaphysical something that cannot be
subjected to a process of physical analysis, and
that will not submit to the rule of physical
instruction.” He goes on to state that he

INQUIRY CONCERNING ELOCUTION 11
believed otherwise both in regard to mind and
voice, and was determined to get rid of“ spirit-
uality” and to establish the fact thať expres-
sion of voice is due to physical causes. Most
exact inquiries are made on all points, inflexions
of the voice most carefully measured, tones
described and applied to appropriate emotions,
and all spiritual and psychic action to a
physical mechanical science. The work was
the result of years of patient scientific inquiry,
and the learning and prestige of the writer
caused elocutionists both in England and
America to accept, to a considerable extent,
the rigid methods of expression advocated. It
should be noted, however, that this was the
work of a theorist. Dr. Rush was not an
elocutionist : he was a man of considerable
learning who led the elocutionist astray.
The lesson to be learnt from tradition is
always important, but we are nevertheless very
slow to learn the lessons the past can teach.
Quite recently at Oxford University I heard a
lecture on “Sheridan the Dramatist," and in
the course of his remarks the lecturer referred in
a somewhat amused and contemptuous manner
to the obsession of Thomas Sheridan with
spoken English. The lecturer had a terrible
voice and delivery, one of the worst. I have
ever heard; he read his manuscript closely,

12 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
hardly raising his head, and apparently his
writing was not very legible, for several times
during the lecture he had to wait and gaze
long and earnestly at his page before he could
read some simple word. It was impossible for
him to substitute another or to alter the form
of his sentence, and the audience waited
patiently. There was a smile of amused toler-
ance on many faces, but the remarks of some
French and American students who were
present might have aroused the lecturer to a
recognition that there was something after all in
Sheridan'sobsession which he had not fathomed.
I have dealt at some length with Sheridan
and the old writers because such remarks as
those I quoted at the beginning of this chapter
and the sentiments expressed by the University
lecturer seem to suggest a want of knowledge
as to what elocution is and has tried to accom-
plish. The scope of this book will not allow
of any detailed following up of this theme, but
reasons for the present " contempt” of elocu-
tion may be briefly indicated.
In the eighteenth century, as we have seen,
the elocutionist was a classic scholar, philologist,
rhetorician, and grammarian. Letters not
sounds, writing not speech, became the general
care. This neglect in the trend of education
has continued up to the present day. We can


## p. 13 (#23) ##############################################

INQUIRY CONCERNING ELOCUTION 13
see on looking back that all the knowledge
which applied to the written language was
carried on in the stream of the educational
movement, and, with the opportunities afforded
by comparative study and practical experience,
has developed and advanced with the times.
The study of rhetoric may be excepted. The
study of elocution has been carried on through
the intervening years by a succession of teachers
who, with few opportunities for the necessary
training, have, at all events, attempted to
make up for their deficiencies by devotion to
their subject.
We must now deal with the position of
elocution and the stage. For many years,
while speech training had no place in education,
the importance of elocution was recognized by
the dramatic profession, although the English
stage has never been so well served in this
respect as the French, but the change of style
both in plays and acting in modern days, the
reversion to natural and realistic plays and
natural and realistic acting, very quickly
revealed the artificialities of the old-fashioned
elocutionary methods; and the short-sighted
consequence was that on the stage, as in the
educational world, elocution at last met with
universal condemnation.
It should be noted, however, that this


## p. 14 (#24) ##############################################

14 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
declining interest in speech as an important
element in the art of acting has been contem-
porary with the development of spectacular
drama and the decline of a literary drama. In
Shakespeare and literary drama generally
good elocution is essential. It must be admitted
that the rigidity and artificiality of the old
elocutionary methods were not adapted to a
natural style, and that the stage did well to
reject false methods, but it did not do well to
cease to concern itself with fine speech because
of the false methods of elocution, and there can
be no doubt that as a result the general stan-
dard of acting has declined. But lest I should
be regarded as a prejudiced witness on this
subject let me call others.
One of our finest dramatic critics, Mr. E. A.
Baughan, recently wrote: “If only our young
actresses would visit the Century Theatre they
would learn a valuable lesson in how to speak.
... They would learn, among other things,
how a trained elocutionist, as Miss Lena
Ashwell was before she did any stage work,
can give just the right inflexion of meaning
to a word so that everything the author
intended is expressed dramatically and natur-
ally."
I would add that another actress from whom
much of the power of vivid expression through

INQUIRY CONCERNING ELOCUTION 15
voice, face, and body could be learnt is Lucille
la Verne in the American play " Sun Up."
But another witness must be called. Arnold
Bennett says he has “ assisted at hundreds of
rehearsals ” and claims that he should
“know a little about it. ... An actor's first
business is to be heard, not only in the first two
of the stalls, but also in the back row of the pit.
The curse of the West End stage is inaudibility.
I have heard hundreds of complaints on this
point, and hundreds of times, even in the stalls,
I have failed to catch the spoken word. My
hearing is excellent. Nearly all good actors are
perfectly audible ; few bad actors are perfectly
audible. A large proportion of actors, if at
rehearsals you tell them that they are not audible,
begin to shout, or, at any rate, to put a strain on
their throats. Audibility has nothing to do
with shouting. They simply have never learnt
how to pitch their voices; they don't know the
first thing about voice production. The men are
just as faulty as the women.
“As to the more advanced stages of elocution,
their ignorance is apparently complete. They
persistently drop important syllables in words and
important words in sentences, especially the last
word in sentences. They do not know when to
emphasize, when to run the tone up and when to
run it down; they cannot balance a sentence.
All these matters they have to be taught, detail by
detail, at rehearsals, and much time is spent on
tuition which ought to be unnecessary and which
the learners ought to be ashamed to have to accept.


## p. 16 (#26) ##############################################

16 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
“Further, grave errors of pronunciation are
rife in the West End. For example, the horrible
interpolated 'r' between two vowels Thus many
actors will pass from cradle to the grave and never
say correctly ‘Soda-and-milk.' They will always
say, 'Soda-rand-milk.' You expostulate with
them. You say to them, ‘Don't say “Soda-
rand-milk,” say “Soda-and-milk.”' They look
blank, then protest, ‘But I did say “Soda-rand-
milk !”! You give it up.
“Worse than this, English is often spoken on the
stage with a bad accent, usually a Cockney accent.
Women are the worst sinners here. Two of the
very foremost actresses in the West End to-day
habitually speak with a Cockney accent; they
are incapable of giving the ‘ Oo 'sound as it ought
to be given. Instead of saying 'boon' they say
'beon,' with a trace of the French 'u' sound.
They are charming women, they are modest
women, they are admirable actresses; they are
heard to perfection, but they cannot talk English.
It is very odd. Nobody seems to mind.”
In spite of Mr. Bennett's pessimism, there
are happily many indications, both in regard
to the stage and education generally, that
slowly but surely elocution, under one name or
another, is coming into its kingdom. The
educational world refuses to accept a word
which has the unfortunate reputation which
has gathered round "elocution," and prefers
to invent new names rather than acknowledge
an old subject which, in the past, it has

neglected. The “Stage " newspaper, on the
other hand, in two succeeding leading articles
recently made a strong appeal for training in
“ elocution" as the great need of the dramatic
profession to-day.
Expression through the voice is a province
of acting which the cinema cannot touch, and
there is little doubt that along that line the
legitimate stage must find its salvation.
In the next chapter I shall discuss methods of
studying elocution which, although they may
be considered from the historical point of
view, are nevertheless in actual practice with
us to-day.
CHAPTER II
ELOCUTIONARY METHODS PAST
AND PRESENT
The Imitative Method
THE earliest method employed to develop
I powers of expression in the individual and
to teach elocution was certainly that of imita-
tion. In favour of such a method it was and is
argued that expression is an imitative thing,
that it requires example ; the singing master
must sing the note for his pupil to imitate the
quality of tone, for only in this way can the
pupil learn to distinguish between his own

uncontrolled effort and that of the artist.
Certainly very few students of any art would
make much progress if left to themselves, any
more than the child would learn to read by
being confronted with a world of books. It is
because imitation as a teaching method is
partly good that its strength and weakness
need to be clearly recognized. We must be quite
clear as to what exactly we understand by the
word " imitation.” It is evident that Aristotle
meant something very much more fundamental
than our common usage of the word suggests.
Imitation in the modern and popular sense
of the word deals with externals, and art must
be the embodiment in some form of its own
inner activity. It is undoubtedly true that
imitation of an intonation or of a bodily move-
ment may induce an emotional response as
sincere in its effect upon the nature and as
stimulative of a mental image or an idea, as if
the sequence of psychic and physical activity
had been reversed and that the idea had given
rise to the emotional response and that in its
turn to the physical expression in intonation,
or gesture.
Indeed, one school of psychologists attri-
butes emotional effect to physical stimulus, and
even if we do not adopt this point of view we
must recognize that the giving of expression

to an emotional urge tends to strengthen
the emotional capacity. When the Imitative
method is used in teaching its function must
be recognized as being definitely to awaken the
imagination. If imitation remains purely
physical, objective, and concerned with super-
ficial effects rather than inner realization, then
it is a danger and a snare in its effect, both
artistically and morally.
It is the empty and arid use of the imitative
faculty which Ruskin treats with such scorn.
“ These ideas and pleasures,” he says, “are
the most contemptible which can be received
from art; first because it is necessary to their
enjoyment that the mind should reject the
impression and address of the thing represented,
and fix itself only upon the reflection that it is
not what it seems to be. All high and noble
emotion and thought is thus rendered physically
impossible, while the mind exults in what is very
much like a strictly sensual pleasure. We
may consider tears as a result of agony or of
art, whichever we please, but not of both at
the same moment. If we are surprised by
them as an attainment of the one, it is im-
possible we can be moved as a sign of the other.
Ideas of imitation are contemptible in the
second place because not only do they preclude
the spectator from enjoying beauty in the

subject, but they can only be received from
mean and paltry subjects, because it is im-
possible to imitate anything really great. We
can paint a cat or a fiddle, so that they look as
if we could take them up, but we cannot
imitate the ocean or the Alps. We can
imitate fruit, but not a tree ; flowers, but not
a pasture; cut glass, but not a rainbow.
Thirdly, these ideas are contemptible because
no ideas of power are associated with them;
to the ignorant imitation indeed seems difficult,
and its success praiseworthy, but even they can
by no means see more in the artist than they do
in the juggler, who arrives at a strange end by
means with which they are unacquainted. To
the instructed the juggler is by far the more
respected artist of the two, for they know the
sleight of hand to be an art of immensely more
difficult acquirement, and to imply more
ingenuity in the artist than a power of deceptive
imitation in painting, which requires nothing
more for its attainment than a true eye, a
steady hand, and moderate industry-qualities
which in no degree separate the imitative
artist from a watchmaker, pinmaker, or any
other neat-handed artificer."
It is the kind of industry in imitation here
described by Ruskin which, in connexion with
the study of elocution, has brought down upon

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 21
it such well-deserved scorn, for if imitation is
contemptible in the art of painting, or in music,
it is even more contemptible and painful in the
most fundamental of all arts-expression
through personality. Nevertheless, it has been
urged-indeed Ruskin himself makes this point
-that dramatic art is an exception to all other
arts in respect of imitation. But is it? This
would mean that it is based upon artificiality.
Is it not true that before you can express a
passion your imagination must have conceived
so strong an image or idea of it as to move
within the mind the same emotional springs
as would have been the case if the passion were
undesigned and undetermined ?
It is impossible to enter here into the old
controversy of whether the actor actually
experiences the emotion of his part when on
the stage. I have dealt with this point at some
length elsewhere, 1 and in “ Masks and Faces,"
by William Archer, a book now out of print,
many diverse opinions were gathered from emi-
nent actors and actresses of several nationalities.
Unfortunately it is superficially easier to
teach by the imitative method than by any
other. It is much simpler to say “Copy me"
than it is to arouse a sluggish mind to think
continually and vividly, or to awaken in minds

which are purely intellectual an emotional
response. To train and develop the great
imaginative faculty of the mind, to balance
the emotional response by intellectual thought,
and to induce the student to bring his voice, face
and body under his own mental control, requires
much more time, patience and ability from the
teacher than exhibiting himself as an example.
It is not surprising therefore that many reach
the point of despair indicated by Sheridan,
when he says, “I have almost worn out a long
life in laborious exertions. ... Read as I
read without any reason for it.” But in actual
fact this is a counsel of impossibility. A
student cannot use an untrained instrument
as a master can; and even if he had an equally
good instrument, the expression could only be
physically and psychically identical if it were
a revelation of the same soul. Imitation, like
mimicry, fastens upon mannerisms and pecu-
liarities of voice and temperament, and exag-
gerates them. Voice, temperament, character,
and mentality are different in every individual,
and even if it were possible for one individual
to imitate exactly the psychic and physical
manifestations of another, the result would
not be expression, nor would it be art.
Before leaving the subject of imitation it
may be advisable to be a little more explicit in


## p. 23 (#33) ##############################################

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 23
regard to its psychological effect. This is a
matter round which endless controversy has
raged, and is likely to rage, in the world of
religion as well as of art. Art and religion are
fundamentally associated in human nature,
and some problems of ritual and expression are
common to both. Let us then take as an illus-
tration the expression of the complex emotions
involved in the feeling of reverence and worship.
You are moved to a feeling of deep reverence,
so overpoweringly strong that you have an urge
within you to kneel and bow the head. 'It may
be impossible for you to yield to this impulse at
the moment, but that outward sign would be
the natural bodily expression of your spirit.
On the other hand, on an occasion of formal
worship you may kneel because others are
doing so, and yet the outward form be no
expression of any inward feeling. But if you
acknowledge the truth of the impulse, then
kneeling is instinctively a right form of ex-
pression. The psychological point to notice is
that kneeling being a natural expression of the
feeling, that feeling is likely to be induced by
the kneeling.
It is here that we find the value of imitation
in teaching. Imitation by voice and body can,
and often does, arouse emotional response ;
unfortunately, it can, and often does, remain a

24 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
mere empty form. It is the duty of the student
and the teacher to see that imitation, if used,
is used as a means to an end and not an end
in itself, and that the emotion and thought
content are equal to the outward form em-
ployed, whether in voice or gesture. Only
in this way can expression be sincere and true
artistry be achieved.
The Mechanical Method.
It was to escape from the limitation of the
imitative method that, as indicated in the
previous chapter, Sheridan. Walker and other
elocutionists attempted to teach expression
by rule. It would be waste of time to discuss
thoroughly the intricacies of the various
systems which have been involved from time
to time. Sheridan and Walker endeavoured
to create a system of mechanical marks
for vocal expression; and Austin, in his
“Chironomia,” published in 1805, endeavoured
to introduce a system of notation for gesture.
The idea that gesture is an effect which may be
added to delivery lingers to-day.
Now, it should be noted that the contention
of the elocutionist that all art is founded upon
principles was perfectly right; their second
conclusion that all that is necessary is to trace
the principles and found upon these principles


## p. 25 (#35) ##############################################

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 25
th
a set of rules is not so sound. And, alas !
between principles and rules there is room for
almost as much error as the human mind can
conceive. And when the rules are embodied
in mechanical marks and signs, and when, as
in Austin's “Chironomia,” as fundamental a
form of expression as gesture and facial ex-
pression is represented by a system of notation,
indicating by letters when and how and what
to move, then indeed are fetters woven about
the spirit and truth goes bound in chains.
It may be worth while to note, however,
that Sheridan explains in a letter written in
connexion with a course of lectures he was to
give at Oxford University that he had been
at great pains to formulate a method in order
to satisfy the requirements of the educational
authorities. Apparently educational author-
ities even then wanted systems, rules, and
syllabuses, and found it hard to realize the
nature of the subject which, at its best, means
a development of individual capacity rather
than the acquisition of facts and theories.
Even to-day one is asked to prepare detailed
syllabuses when the work to be done is the de-
velopment of expressional power of individuals.
Some of these old rules of elocution, elevated
to the rank of principles, are almost unbeliev-
ably remote from art and life. Here are some

26 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
instructions taken from Sheridan's and Hen-
derson's“ Practical Method of Reading and Re-
citing Poetry” (1796) which at all events serve
to shower ridicule upon the method, although,
even to-day, it is not unknown that students
should ask for teaching on similar lines !
If the reciter finds himself deficient in the pathetic
and wishes to improve himself in that most essential
part of reading, we do not know of many pieces in
the whole range of English poetry that possess so
much of it as the following:
It was a winter evening and soft came down the snow
(Look upwards when you speak the last part of the
line.)
And keenly o'er the wild heath the bitter blast did
blow,
(Keep up the dreary scene described by your whole
appearance.)
When a damsel all forlorn, quite bewildered in her way,
(Pause a little after“ damsel.” “ All forlorn" and
“bewildered” in a tone descriptive of the sad,
melancholy situation pictured by the poet.)
Prest her baby to her bosom and sadly thus did say:
(Now you alter your voice to the most pathetic
tone you are master of.)
Oh, cruel was my father that shut his door on me,
And cruel was my mother that such a sight could see,
And cruel is the wintry wind that chills my heart
with cold
(In speaking the first part of the last line look up
and place your hand on your breast at the
word “heart.")

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 27
This is a “poem” almost as unfortunate in
its composition as in the instructions for its
delivery. It serves to show, however, that a
Mechanical method of elocution means the
application of rules and precise directions
for the expression of emotion, and entirely
prevents the development of that spontaneity
of expression which should be the result of any
true art-technique.
Walker had said in regard to the expression
of feeling :
The tones of the passion or emotion mean only
that quality of sound that indicates the feeling of
the speaker without any reference to the pitch or
loudness of his voice ; and it is in being easily suscep-
tible of every passion and emotion that presents
itself, and being able to express them with that
peculiar quality of sound which belongs to them, that
the great art of reading and speaking consists.
But although both Sheridan - and Walker
were apparently sound in the principles they
laid down, they contradicted their own prin-
ciples by recommending that “matter to be
given in public should be written out,
and after careful consideration pauses and
emphases, etc., should be marked, and . : . the
delivery should conform to the marks made.”
Such a system must be a failure, because even
if any method of annotating could be effective,
the attention of the reader or speaker is fixed

28 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
on his own voice instead of on the matter, with
the result that the delivery is bound to be in-
sincere and artificial. But no system of marks
can be effective. By marking the emphatic
words it is true you can prevent such a serious
mistake as it is possible to make with the words,
“And he said, 'Saddle me the ass.' And they
saddled him." But it is possible to underline
the emphatic words in the sentence and yet
by an intonation to give an entirely erroneous
meaning. “Is a candle brought to be put
under a bushel or under a bed ? ” You can
give such an intonation to the words“ bushel ”
and " bed” that the meaning conveyed is that
the candle must be put under one or the other,
which is certainly a wrong interpretation.
In the following verses the word “ England"
is the central word, but it is possible, merely by
emphasis, to make “ England” seem to be the
source of all the ills that befall mankind,
instead of, as is intended, the inspiration to
work and self-sacrifice :
Tell the tune his feet beat on the ground all
day-
Black-burnt ground and green grass, seamed with
rocks of grey~
" England,” “ England,” “ England," that one word
they say.
Now they tread the beech-mast, now the ploughman's
clay,

Now the faery bell-floor of her fields in May,
Now her red June sorrel, now her new-turned bay,
Now they keep the great road, now by sheep-path
stray.
Still its "England," "England," "England” all the
way!
As indicated in the previous chapter, Rush
and others who followed him were prepared
to explain the soul as a physical mechanism,
and were determined not “to dodge among
cerebral fibres and cells after an invisible and
trackless spirit.” They insisted that all
emotional and spiritual quality and change
of tone could be made the subject of physical
analysis, and that directions of a physical
nature could be given for their accomplish-
ment. I have spent some hours examining
the “ Philosophy of the Human Voice," and
I must confess that it reduced me to a state of
despair. What is one to make of the following
statement : “ That the emphatic vocule will
be very apt to follow the organic opening of
the atomic abrupt”; “Emphasis of pitch
is an important subject, and you must care-
fully study symbols of interrogation and know
whether you should rise to the third, fifth or
octave; all emotions may be grouped under
different qualities of tone, the orotund, pure
tone, aspirate quality and the tremor”?
Some later writers than Rush have given


## p. 30 (#40) ##############################################

30 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
even more explicit directions for the expression
of emotion. For example, "Sorrow is to be
rendered in low pitch, long quality, aspirate
quality and slow time.” There should be no -
need, and yet I fear that in some quarters
there is need even to-day, to point out that
if the mind is occupied by such directions it is
not centred on the idea to be expressed; the
imagination is ruled out and all attention is
given to the effect to be produced, which is
inevitably fatal to the effect which should be
produced. Such lamentable directions take
no cognizance of the fact that both Sorrow
and Joy have a range which extends over the
whole of human life, and that both Sorrow and
Joy are felt and expressed differently at
different ages and by different temperaments.
To express Sorrow and Joy in all the range of
human expression means a knowlege and under-
standing of human nature and of life, and the
possession of a physical instrument capable of
producing a wonderful range of subtle tones.
Imagine studying that agonized cry of Enoch
Arden :
“Too hard to bear, why did they take me hence ?
O God Almighty, blesséd Saviour, Thou
That didst uphold me on my lonely isle,
Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness
A little longer; aid me, give me strength

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 31
and endeavouring to apply the directions
“aspirated quality, weeping utterance and
chromatic thirds and fifths !” Thought and
emotion would both be precluded, imagination
would cease to be.
It is this fixing of the attention by such
unimaginably false methods on effect instead
of the poet's thought and images that gives
us the terrible exhibitions which still appear
as examples of the teaching of elocution. I
myself have sat and marvelled at the ingenuity
of effects which it is possible to introduce into
poems. I have heard and seen little children
recite that exquisite poem of Blake, “ Little
Lamb who Made Thee,” and give the whole
of their attention to kneeling down to caress
an imaginary lamb on the stage, and after-
wards to lifting it and fondling it in their arms.
I suppose if the same method were applied
to another poem of Blake, “ Tiger, Tiger,
Burning Bright,” the platform would scarcely
hold both tiger and reciter at the same time,
and what the appropriate effect should be I
have never been able even to imagine. I have
seen older girls in a vain attempt to speak
“ The Listeners," by Walter de la Mare, dash
across the platform and make a movement as
if they were beating loudly upon a closed door.
These terrible exhibitions are the result of


## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################

32 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
an inherently false method which directs
attention to artificial and mechanical effects
instead of a subjective appreciation of the
emotion and thought-content of the words
uttered. In these poems the pictures, the
gestures, are in the words and want no other
expression.
This much must be said, however, for the
Mechanical School-it revealed the need for
scientific knowledge of the Voice, its use and
training; it emphasized the weakness of the
purely imitative method, and it opened up a
vision which is still only visible to the clear-
sighted, that “when instructions shall grow
out of the philosophy of speech, instead of
imitation, the defects of utterance, now so
common as to require notice, will be confined
like the faults of grammar to the uneducated.”
The “ Natural ” Method
The so-called “Natural” Style of Elocution
is founded on a fallacy, or rather on several
fallacies. I quote the word "natural" in this
connexion from Part IV of Archbishop
Whately's work on Rhetoric. In this section
of the book he deals with the subject of delivery
and discusses exhaustive the demerits of
the Imitative and Mechanical methods of
teaching elocution. He does not for one


## p. 33 (#43) ##############################################

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 33
moment under-estimate the importance of
delivery: indeed, he enphasizes it :
Few need to be told that the effect of the most
perfect composition may be entirely destroyed, even
by a Delivery which does not render it unintelligible ;
that one which is inferior both in matter and style
may produce, if better spoken, a more powerful effect
than another which surpasses it in both of those
points; and that such an elocution as does not spoil
the effect of what is said may yet fall far short of
doing full justice to it.”
Yet he severely condemns all methods, known
to him, of teaching delivery. He is, indeed,
very much more effective in his condemnation
of bad methods than he is in formulating any
constructive theory for the acquirement of a
good delivery. Unfortunately, in this as in all
phases of life, it is so much easier to pull down
than to build up. Whateley's teaching may
be summed up in the phrase, “Take care of the
Sense and the Sound will take care of itself.”
This advice is quite good if you bracket with it
“ Take care of the Sound and the Sense will
take care of itself.” Cryptic phrases which
express a half truth are quite useless as a guide
in the teaching of an art. It is true that they
may contain the particular lesson which one
individual requires at one particular moment,
but that fact does not make either of the above
phrases sound as general maxims. Whateley


## p. 34 (#44) ##############################################

34 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
says :“... Why not leave nature to do her
own work ? Impress but the mind fully with
the sentiment, etc., to be uttered, withdraw
the attention from the sound, and fix it on the
sense; and nature or habit will spon-
taneously suggest the proper delivery.".
Now, unfortunately, there is not the slightest
doubt that Archbishop Whateley's exhaustive
treatment of the absurdities of the mechanical
and imitative methods did very much to
encourage the idea that in delivery all that is
necessary is to “be natural," and this idea
continually crops up even to-day.
We will therefore inquire further into the
fallacies of the use of the word "natural"
in this connexion. In the first place, very
few persons can be described as truly natural;
they have become an accumulation of more or
less bad habits, physical or mental. Their
voices through lack of adequate use on the
right lines are rigid and unmusical, their bodies
are stiff and unaccustomed to expression, their
emotional nature is often limited to the
demands of their own narrow environment,
their thought lacks the vividness, concentra-
tion and energy which will cause its projection
into other minds, their speech is mumbling
and indistinct. If such an individual gets
on to a platform and attempts any form of


## p. 35 (#45) ##############################################

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 85
delivery, either as speaker, reciter, or actor,
he will be utterly ineffective, however con-
scientiously he attempts to fix his attention
on the sense of what he is saying. He would
probably not attempt to give his attention to
the sound, as he is precluded by the very
nature of his physical and mental limitations
from having any sense of the value of the sound
of words and of the relation of sound and
meaning. Are we then to call such an
individual “natural”? No, rather he is the
unhappy result of a system which believed
in imparting knowledge as the sole means of
education rather than developing the individual
faculties. True education pays equal atten-
tion to impression and expression, and the
result is an articulate human being. No, an
individual such as I have described above
cannot be called "natural.” The course he
pursues, whether on the platform or off it,
will be what is, unhappily, habitual to him,
not what is in the true sense“ natural.”
The first fallacy in the term “natural,”
then, is inherent in the mistaken use of the
word. The second fallacy is to be found in
the assumption that to be natural under
unnatural conditions requires no training.
Let me illustrate this. We will assume that
an individual, with powers of expression very

36 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
much higher than the representation of the
very large class I have attempted to describe
above, is wishful to enter public life. For
ordinary purposes of private life he speaks
clearly and adequately, but put him on a
platform in a fairly large hall and the result
will be that he will be less effective and con-
vincing than in private life. In private
conversation he can state his views fairly well,
he can “hold” an audience of one, or even
a small group of people, but on a platform
before a large audience he is unexpectedly
ineffective. For one thing, he is utterly
inexperienced in regard to the psychology of
an audience; he knows nothing about the
problem of getting " in tune" with his listeners
and getting them “in tune” with himself.
Then his voice, pleasant and well-modulated
as it may possibly be, is not a sufficiently good
instrument either in volume, flexibility, or
expressiveness for the enlargement of audience,
space, and subject; for a subject must be
treated differently and the delivery must be
broader and more vivid for a large audience
than for a private conversation. Under the
strain of unnatural conditions and the con-
scious or subconscious knowledge of ineffec-
tiveness the speaker will at once begin to
cultivate bad habits. He will force his voice


## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################

ELOCUTIONARY METHODS 37
in the effort, as he thinks, to be audible until
he is shouting instead of talking, and all the
musical tone and natural modulation of his
voice will be destroyed; or he may become
dogmatic and over-emphatic in style, thereby
antagonizing instead of persuading his
audience. He is either stiff in his manner
and speech or so easy as to be entirely lacking
in power. The voice is often injured by the
strain of attempting to be “natural” under
unnatural conditions. Often on the strength
of a little gratuitous advice from one of those
kind people who think they know everything,
and do not hesitate to give hints on subjects
upon which they know nothing, the untrained
beginner will be plunged into further diffi-
culties. He will be told to "take care of the
.consonants and the vowels will take care of
themselves.” He then proceeds to hammer
out his consonants and eliminate his vowels
even more thoroughly than the majority of
southern English people habitually do ; quite
oblivious of the fact that it is musical tone
which makes the voice “ carry,” and that tone
is produced upon vowels and diphthongs, hardly
at all upon consonants, which, strictly, are
interruptions of tone.
This exaggeration of consonants at the
expense of vowels is a habit many teachers

have acquired, and the result is harsh, raucous
voices, utterly unfitted for teaching or any
other useful purpose. The owners of such
voices cannot hope to be good disciplinarians
or to hold the attention of their scholars. Or,
if the speaker's sphere is the Church, he will
probably be told to “ keep his voice up at the
end of sentences.” The result will be that he
will end his sentences on a rising inflexion,
leaving the meaning of his phrase in the air,
unconvincing and undetermined. The advice
which, of course, should be given in this case
is “to sustain the tone to the end of the
sentence"; but giving such advice would not
help an untrained speaker if his breath control
and voice production were faulty. Only
training will cure the fault of dropping the tone
at the end of sentences so that words become
inaudible. No, to be natural under unnatural
conditions is a matter of training.
But we must pass on to the third fallacy in
this so-called “Natural Elocution.” That
lies in the complete ignoring of the fact that
all skilled forms of expression have their own
technique, and freedom in any particular form
of expression can only be acquired by going
through the mill, i.e. arriving at complete
control and artistry through such practice
in technique that technique is forgotten and

has apparently ceased to be. That is because
some forms of art force their recognition upon us
and others do not. We are compelled to realize
that there is much work to be done before one
can play the violin, or the piano, because there
is an objective instrument foreign to our use
over which we have to obtain control; but
when the instrument we have to play upon is
our own speaking voice it is not nearly so
obvious that we cannot play upon it. In fact,
in nothing is self-deception more easy than in
regard to one's own voice and speech. This is
because our sense of what is right in speech is
governed by the motor memories of our own
speech, and it is a matter of training to escape
from a blind dependence upon this fact.
One of the ablest of the younger members
of the present House of Commons, and cer-
tainly one of the best speakers in the House,
when addressing the author's class for public
speakers, emphasized very forcibly the necessity
for full and adequate vocal training. He
showed how a singer preparing for a public
career will spend years in perfecting the tone
and control of voice and diction, and then will
appear upon the Queen's Hall platform, there
to sing a song lasting about five minutes.
Neither the words nor the music will be
original; they will have been provided for the

singer, who will further be helped in the
difficult task of holding the audience by a
musical accompaniment played by an efficient
accompanist. And yet a speaker will essay a
far more difficult task, will attempt to address
an audience for fifteen, twenty, or forty minutes
with a very inadequate preparation of his
material, and with no training whatever of his
voice, his speech, and other agents of expres-
sion. No wonder that, in spite of all the
talking that goes on in schoolroom, college,
platform, and pulpit, only a minimum of the
speaker's intention is ever realized.
In these remarks I have dealt more obviously
with elocution in connexion with oratory, but
they are equally applicable to all forms of
speech, verse-speaking, or other forms of
recitation, acting and preaching. Thus we see
that “natural elocution” is a fallacious term
and that Whateley's advice, sensible as it may
sound, is in fact entirely misleading. In the
following chapters we will go on to consider
a sound method of studying elocution, and
since the methods condemned have distinguish-
ing names we must, although somewhat
unwillingly, give a name to the method
advocated.

CHAPTER III
PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION
The Voice
ALTHOUGH mechanical elocution may
H have drawn attention to the necessity
for scientific knowledge in regard to the voice,
I am afraid it can hardly be claimed that it
actually contributed knowledge of any value.
In recent years two specialists on the pro-
duction of the speaking voice, Dr. H. H. N.
Hulbert 1 and Dr. W. A. Aiken,' have both done
research work and written books of great value.
Without going into physiological detail of
too specialized a character, we have now to
consider the voice as an instrument. We have,
indeed, to consider it as an instrument in two
respects: first, for the production of sound;
and second, as an organ of articulate speech.
When we think of the voice as an instrument
for the production of sound we realize that
there are three distinct parts to that instru-
ment, each one fulfilling a separate function.
The mechanism of the voice consists of
1. A motor apparatus.
2. A vibratory apparatus.
3. Articulatory apparatus with resonating
chambers.

The motor apparatus is formed by the

organ situated at the top of the windpipe, or
trachea, the larynx. The articulatory and re-
sonating mechanism includes the pharynx, the
mouth, the nasal cavities, the tongue, the lips,
the lower jaw, and the soft and hard palates.
The Vibratory Apparatus.—Of this three-
fold mechanism there is one part which,
interesting as it is to the phonologist, does not
really concern us in a practical course of voice
training; or perhaps it would be better to say
it concerns us only indirectly. We have no
conscious control over the laryngeal muscles
engaged in setting up that vibration of the air
column which thus becomes sound, and as we
can establish no manner of control we cannot
train the larynx to perform its work any better
than the instinctive mind allows. Indeed, there
is no reason why we should, since the work
is perfectly performed-assuming there is no
organic trouble—when the movements of the
motor and articulatorymechanism are smoothly
co-ordinated, purposeful, and rhythmic.
Since this little book seeks to be helpful
only on practical lines there is no need to

give a detailed account of the larynx. It is
easily discoverable in the column of the neck ;
the protuberance known as “ Adam's Apple”
is formed by the thyroid cartilages, two large
wing-like enveloping sheaths of the organ.
There are, however, one or two points which it
is well to remember in practical voice work:
(1) Be careful not to strain the outer
laryngeal muscles by tilting the chin up. This
is apparently a favourite position with ardent
reciters. It is ugly and it is bad for the voice.
Stiffness of the outer laryngeal muscles must
inevitably mean contraction and strain of the
actual voice muscles. In regard to the badness
of the poise I shall have more to say on page 57.
(2) Remember that the sound produced in
the larynx is modulated and enlarged by action
above the larynx, and it is for this reason that
a hard, unmusical voice may become musical,
resonant, and attractive. So many people
imagine they are born with the voice with
which it has become habitual to them to
express their thoughts, that it is due to the
niggardliness of the gods that their particular
larynx does not produce musical tone, and
that all they can do is to submit. This is not
so. It is true some voices start as good ones,
but a poor voice may become good, and a hard
voice may become musical by training.

(3) The third point may sound somewhat
of an Irishism following the two previous ones,
but in some respects it is the most important.
Forget that you have a larynx and when
training give all your attention to the other
two parts of vocal mechanism.
The Motor Mechanism.-The motor power
of voice is, of course, the breath, and in order
to have a controlled voice it is necessary to
control the movements connected with breath-
ing. In ordinary physiological breathing
movement takes place automatically. Pressure
of air fills up the number of minute cells of
which the lungs are composed, the chest walls
are expanded through the action of the inter-
costal muscles (the muscles connecting the
ribs), and the diaphragm (a large, umbrella-
shaped muscle forming the floor of the chest)
rises. The reactionary muscular movement
is, of course, a contraction, and the walls of
the chest collapse and the air rushes out.
Now it is possible to control the movements
of muscles used in breathing, and the more
perfectly they are controlled the greater will
be the power over the voice ; for tone is com-
pressed air in vibration. On page 60 will be
found exercises for daily practice, but what I
want to point out here is the nature of the
movement involved. First of all, the move-


## p. 45 (#55) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 45
ment must not be mechanical : even a simple
breathing movement for voice must be a
mind-directed effort. By examining dia-
grams, photographs or skeletons, and by
feeling one's own body, a definite idea of the
position of various important strategic points
may be obtained. The base of the sternum
or breast bone (about seven inches below the pit
of the throat) is one such point ; for level with
this point at the sides will be found the seventh
and eighth ribs, the part of the chest capable
of the widest expansion. If the hand be
placed on the front abdominal wall just below
the pit of the stomach, and the muscles gently
contracted under the hand, it will be found
that the contraction of the abdominal muscles
causes the chest wall to rise. This is due to
the upward movement of the diaphragm. It
will be realized, therefore, that the chest, or
thorax, is a fairly flexible box, the walls of
which move outward and inward, and the floor
of which moves upward and downward, and
the contents of the box are, for practical
purposes, a column of air-potential voice.
Ease in inspiration, economy and control in
expiration, both essential for good voice work,
depend upon the flexibility and control of
these muscles governing the column of air.
Full directions for breathing exercises will


## p. 46 (#56) ##############################################

46 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
be found on page 60, and one or two attempts
to carry out these directions will probably
convince the reader that these co-ordinated
movements of intercostal muscles and dia-
phragm result in the emission of a steady and
consistent stream of air during the expiration.
But it is only by practice over many months
that a satisfactory result will be achieved.
The Voice as an Organ of Articulate Speech.-
Most of the very bad speaking of English which
is a distinguishing mark of our race, when not
due to bad breathing methods, may be traced
to an inadequate utilization of vocal sound
through lip laziness and rigidity of the lower
jaw. Owing to these faults vowels are
physically shapeless, and therefore formless
as distinct sounds. When vowels are thus
neglected there is insufficient tone utilized in
the pronunciation of words, and the voice is
poor and lacking in carrying quality. In regard
to consonants, the same bad habits produce
other faults. There is a lack of attack and
finish upon the consonants, and consequently
the whole speech lacks firmness and distinction.
Every separate vowel sound means a separate
and distinct shape, and in order to get the full
value of these sounds and utilize the maximum
possibilities of the voice considerable practice
upon every shape is necessary.


## p. 47 (#57) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 47
· Equally necessary is continual practice upon
the consonant formation, so that there may be
sharpness of attack, quickness of release, and
absolute flexibility in moving from one articu-
lation to another.
Great detail in regard to the shapes and
positions required will be found in the books
referred to at the beginning of this chapter,
and also in my own book upon the subject.1
A number of exercises for daily practice
will be found in the following chapter on
page 61, and an effort should be made to
pronounce the repeated vowel sounds with the
fullest possible quantity consistent with free-
dom from drawling and with pure musical
quality. The consonants, on the other hand,
should be given with firmness and precision.
Clarity of diction depends upon the ability
to pronounce firmly and well these elementary
parts of a wordthe vowels and the con-
sonants—and it is only when good diction is
present as a groundwork that any beauty and
expressiveness of speech can be developed.
Mind and Voice
It is a belief quite frequently met that
delivery in itself does not require much mental
effort; that it is, in fact, a physical exercise
1 " The Spoken Word.” Methuen.


## p. 48 (#58) ##############################################

48 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
of a superficial nature. Against this view I
contend that good delivery is quite as much a
mental exercise as good writing, and requires
a much greater combination of powers, both
mental and physical.
There are two mental forces at work govern-
ing the voice in delivery—thought and feeling.
In a well-developed mind these forces are
interfused and almost constantly present, but
in ill-balanced minds you will find an excess
of cold intellectual thought and great weakness
in emotional response ; or, on the other hand,
an uncontrolled emotionalism with little if
any directing thought. Perhaps nothing more
fully reveals the mind of the man in this
respect than vocal delivery, be it preaching,
speaking, acting, or reciting. In delivery one
can imagine these two forces constantly at
work, merging, changing quantities, separating,
and again combining; and the effect of these
changes is to produce many variations in the
tones of the voice, in the energy and rate of
delivery, and in the selection of definite words
and ideas for special prominence.
In the past these changes and variations
of the voice in speaking received distinguishing
names, and unfortunately it became the habit
with elocutionists generally to build rules of
delivery on these classifications, and to forget


## p. 49 (#59) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 49
that they are merely the effects produced by
mental action. Instead, therefore, of being
taught to think more clearly and vividly, to
feel more intensely, and to train the voice as
a flexible instrument to respond to the mental
process, students of elocution were told that
they must use certain inflexions in certain
circumstances : say of doubt or indecision ;
they must speak quickly and with force in
other circumstances : anger, for instance
(oblivious, of course, of the fact that there is
more than one kind of anger), and that they
must do these things because there were
elocutionary rules upon the subject. If people
can escape a little mental exercise they are
generally quite willing to do so. They would
much rather learn a few rules off by heart
than have to think, and think hard, all the
time they are speaking. I have had pupils
who have confessed that they had learnt
elocution for years and never realized all that
time that they needed to think!
Rightly used, however, these various divisions
of what has been called the technique of elocu-
tion may be of great help in gaining flexibility,
firmness, and style in delivery.
Consider the effect of good phrasing, the
definite grouping together of the words forming
one idea in a sentence. It means that the


## p. 50 (#60) ##############################################

50 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
auditor feels as if he is listening to a succession
of ideas, the meaning and sequence of which he
easily grasps, rather than to a number of words
presented to him like a Chinese puzzle, and
which he must sort out and fit together. Good
phrasing has its roots in the mind of the
speaker; and the more clear and definite he is
in his mental process, the more clear is the
phrasing of his matter likely to be, and the
slight pause between one phrase and another
will be found to be part of the rhythmic flow of
speech.
Tone-colour is perhaps more closely associated
with emotion than with thought, but not
wholly so, because, as I have said, thought
and feeling are often so closely intermingled
that it is impossible to separate one from the
other. But tone-colour seems to be the result
in the voice of those subtle changes which
emotions cause in the body. These changes, it
should be noted, can be produced through the
action of the imagination quite as much as
through the awakening of the emotions through
other causes. Many voices, through lack of
the cultivation of the imagination, are entirely
without any range of tone-colour, and indeed
speak incessantly and upon every subject in
one narrow, groovy tone. Sometimes those
who have some imaginative response are quite


## p. 51 (#61) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 51
unable to communicate it to others because
the voice is not a mind-controlled instrument.
Inflexion, on the other hand, may be said to
be more directly under the thought force ;
not wholly so, however, for "scorn” is cer-
tainly emotional, and if you pronounce the
word “ You,” and throw as much scorn as
possible into your pronunciation, the result
will be a long, compound inflexion. But the
sustaining of thought, the balance and anti-
thesis of thought as well as the definite closure
of it, are all accomplished by inflexions of the
voice. In compound inflexions it will be found
that in the mind of the speaker there is always
more to be expressed than the mere word as a
symbol is intended to convey. Such was the
case in the example of scorn suggested above.
If someone asks you if you like the book you
are at the present moment reading and you,
in some doubt, answer“ Yes,” you will convey
more than the word “yes” means : you will
reveal to your friend the divided attitude of
your mind toward this book.
Various exercises on inflexion are given in
the following chapter. They should be prac-
tised with the mind fully alive to every shade
of meaning and feeling, and with the intention,
even at the risk of exaggeration, of making
the whole of the content of the lines alive.


## p. 52 (#62) ##############################################

52 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
Emphasis is, of course, the means by which
the key-word is made to stand out in its true
relationship to the other parts of the sentence.
Often the full meaning depends quite as much
upon the relatively emphatic words, and an
important point to remember in connexion
with emphasis is the due significance of
unimportant words and phrases. Emphasis
is a matter of light and shade; you cannot
obtain a high light if you neglect to put in your
deep shadows. This does not mean that you can
afford to be indistinct with the unimportant
words and phrases; if you are they will drop
out of the picture and you then entirely lose
your deep shadows and effective contrast.
There are many ways of making words
emphatic, the crudest way—but one which
can never be used in lyric poetry—being by
a stress of the voice upon the emphatic word.
Emphasis is often produced by an upward in-
flexion of the voice, thus making the important
word stand out upon a higher pitch. Some-
times it can be conveyed only by a change of
tone-colour, such as we get in the scene in which
Hamlet is reproaching his mother in the line :
Look here upon this picture, and on this.
Again a very dramatic emphasis is achieved
by a pause before the emphatic word or phrase.


## p. 53 (#63) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 53
The psychological reason for this is easily
apparent. The suspended idea is vividly held
by the mind of the speaker: the listeners
having been aroused to a certain degree of
expectation are further excited by having to
wait for the missing word.
Pace is of considerable importance in
delivery. Variation in pace relieves what
might otherwise be a monotonous effect, and
the quicker pace of unimportant passages
throws into relief the more deliberate utterance
of others; or steadily increasing pace on a
dramatic period will arouse the interest and
excitement of the listeners. Pace, of course,
varies according to the size of a building and
according, also, to the nature of the subject.
You cannot effectively address a large audience
in a vast building at a very rapid pace, nor
could you speak upon a sad and solemn subject
with a quick, tripping delivery.
Energy is a very direct effect of the thought-
emotional force of the mind. By the word is
meant here that æsthetic energy which is
recognized as a necessary quality in any work
of art—vitality, life. It does not mean at
all a noisy or even obviously dramatic delivery ;
certainly it does not include such exhibitions
as stamping on the floor, thumping on a table,
shouting, etc. On the contrary, there is likely


## p. 54 (#64) ##############################################

54 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
to be more of this æsthetic energy in a quiet,
intense delivery, for it is a psychic and not a
physical power.
Perhaps enough has been said to show the
close connexion between mind and voice and to
prove that good delivery must be mind-directed.
The Mind in Action
Perhaps nothing has brought down more
discredit upon itself than the gesticulations
of elocutionists. These movements have
generally been bad in themselves considered
simply as movement; but considered as
expressive movement they have been worse
than words can describe. Generally, they are
unnecessary and redundant and serve only to
exhibit the elocutionist in a number of ungrace-
ful positions and movements, and to attract
to themselves the wondering gaze of the
onlookers. When adjudicating at competitions
I have sometimes been filled with a kind of
horrified wonder as to the sources of ingenuity
which must have been tapped before such
gestures could have been conceived and
executed.
On one occasion, when listening to a poem
by Alfred Noyes, I saw the reciter illustrate
the line " A rabbit lollopped down the glade"
with a most wonderful circular movement of


## p. 55 (#65) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 55
both arms. It might well have been an
attempt to act the part of a cart-wheel turning
round! It startled me so much that I lost
the next few lines of the poem.
On another occasion a competitor, while
speaking Queen Katherine's wonderfully
poignant and dignified lines to the King and
Wolsey in her appeal against her divorce, made
a habit of stamping her foot furiously to
emphasize her indignation. It would, I am
sure, have startled the Court-it certainly
startled me. But perhaps the worst example
of “gesticulation” which I have ever seen
was given by a teacher of English who, on the
strength of that qualification, had recently
started teaching Elocution in Evening Insti-
tutes. She wanted my opinion of her work
and came and recited to me the Trial Scene
from the “ Merchant of Venice." She had
conceived this scene, apparently, as a series
of movements with words fitted in somewhere,
and characters in various grotesque positions
leaping from point to point about the stage.
I listened to a good deal of the scene before
I recovered sufficiently from shock to ask the
reciter a few questions. I may add that
details of these movements were written down
in a book, and when the reciter felt one change
had not been executed according to rule she


## p. 56 (#66) ##############################################

56 ELOCUTION DO'S AND DONT'S
referred to her book and did it again. When,
as I have said, I regained my presence of mind,
I asked her if she had any idea of the characters
she was supposed to be depicting; if she
realized that Shylock was governed by strong
passion, and that thought and emotion were
being expressed through words. No, these
very elementary considerations had not
occurred to her. She appeared utterly amazed
when I went on to explain a little of the essential
dramatic value of the scene. Her one idea
had been “gesticulation ” to the point of utter
ludicrousness.
Gesture, or the expression of an idea, a
thought, a feeling, by movement, is only a part
of expression through the body, and perhaps
it is the least significant part. Although the
name may be a little misleading it is better
to consider the whole subject under the title
“ Pantomimic Expression," and we then find
that there are three divisions to study:
Poise
Gesture
Facial Expression.
We have to recognize that whether we
gesticulate or not we cannot avoid, so long
as we are in sight of an audience, speaking
through our bodies. The manner in which


## p. 57 (#67) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 57
we walk on to a platform, the poise of our body,
our position as we stand and face the audience
-all these make a definite impression upon
the audience. Nay, more, they have a definite,
although subconscious, effect upon the artist.
A controlled and easy bearing, a vital poise,
a well-balanced stance-compare these with a
shambling and awkward walk, a feeling of not
knowing where to put one's hands and feet,
chin poking forward and back rounded-
and consider which of the two types is likely
to exercise the greater control over an audience.
Undoubtedly if gesture is to be good it must
be based on a good poise of the body and on
good movement of the limbs in relation to that
poise. The weight of the body must be carried
at that pivotal part of the spinal column
popularly known as the “small of the back,"
the spine must follow its natural curves, with
the pelvis well drawn back but not rigidly so.
The shoulders must be at the right angles to
an imaginary line drawn down through the
body from the top of the head and striking the
ground between the feet, the head held up-
right by the upper part of the spine, and the
chin drawn slightly down and under well
behind the line of the chest wall, the abdominal
wall flat but not unduly retarded or contracted.
This position goes far to ensure the right use


## p. 58 (#68) ##############################################

58 ELOCUTION DO’S AND DONT'S
of the breath, vibratory and articulatory
apparatus in voice work, as well as securing a
good carriage and easy movement.
An artist who wants to control an audience
must be able to control the movements of his
own body, or else he stands before the audience
a lamentable though unconscious confession
of his own failure. Hence all nervous, fidgety,
unnecessary movements-toying with gar-
ments, putting hands in and out of trousers
pockets, twisting fingers, shifting the weight
about from one foot to the other, bending and
poking the knees, etc., etc.—all these awkward,
ungainly and meaningless movements must be
eliminated. They are in themselves a loss of
that nervous power which every artist needs
in controlling an audience.
Facial expression must, of course (except
in farce), always be subconscious. A con-
scious attempt at facial expression is doomed
to failure. It always appears insincere, un-
natural, and often ludicrous. Nevertheless,
the power of expression through the face
can be developed ; it must be done by
strengthening the imaginative vision, and
allowing that realization of feeling to flow
through the whole body. In practice, the
effect of this may be watched in a looking-
glass and an effort made to strengthen the


## p. 59 (#69) ##############################################

PSYCHOLOGICAL ELOCUTION 59
facial expression. It should be noted, how-
ever, that in regard to both gesture and facial
play the technique does not consist merely in
training the body to be expressive. Dramatic
expression entails more than this. You must
be able to register your effects upon your
audience--and it does not at all follow, either
in vocal or pantomimic expression, that
because you feel a thing you are doing
this.
Fencing, dancing, and miming are all excel-
lent for the improvement of poise and panto-
mimic expression. Fencing is admirable for
the first, and for encouraging a quick response
between mind and body. Dancing, particu-
larly natural-movement dancing, is also of
very great value, promoting grace of move-
ment as well as expressive powers. The
practice of miming is, of course, even more
direct in its bearing. The effort to convey
ideas through bodily movement without the
assistance of words necessarily intensifies the
effort, and besides being considerable training
in concentration tends to make facial play,
gesture, and all movements of the torso very
much more definite and expressive.

Negative Constructions.
Let not my cold .words here accuse my zeal,
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate the cause betwixt us twain :
And can I not of such take patience boast,
As to be husht and naught at all to say.
Doubt.
I do beseech your Grace
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires ;
If that I do not dream, or be not frantic,
As I do trust I am not, then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your Highness.
Simple Interrogation.
Think you a little din can daunt my ears ?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar ?
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
Rage like an angry bear ?

Have I not heard great ordnance in the field?
And Heaven's artillery thunder in the sky ?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard ,
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets
clang ?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue ?
Appeal.
Lord Marshal, let me kiss my Sovereign's hand
And bow my knee before his Majesty :
For Mowbray and myself are like two men,
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage ;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.
Supplication.
Oh, save me, Hubert, save me.
For heaven's sake, Hubert, let me not be bound.
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb.
Oh, spare mine eyes
Though to no use but still to look on you.
Exclamatory.
Oh, now and ever
Farewell the tranquil mind ! farewell Content !
Farewell the plumed troop with the big wars
That make ambition virtue! Oh, farewell !
II. Examples of sentences in which, owing
to construction or sense, downward inflexions
predominate. These also should be practised
for controlled definite movement.
Completion of Thought.
The lotos blooms below the barren peak :
The lotos blows by every winding creek ;

All day the wind breathes low with mellower
tone,
Through every hollow cave and alley lone :
Round and round the spicy downs the yellow
lotos-dust is blown.
Thought Sequence.
The passionate prayer-
The wild idolatry—the purple light
Bathing the cold earth from a Hebe's urn-
Yea, all the soul's divine excess which youth
Claims as its own-came back when first I loved
thee.
Complex Interrogation.
Why have you made your other love
(Who even but now did spurn me with his foot)
To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial ? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates ? And wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich, within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth ! affection,
But by your setting on ? by your consent ?
Affirmation ; Conviction.
God's is the quarrel ; for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in his sight,
Hath caused his death; the which if wrongfully,
Let God avenge ; for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister.
III. The following examples giving a number
of compound inflexions, if practised on the
right lines, will make for flexibility of voice,
and may be further studied for the purpose

of realizing the movement of voice under the
stimulus of complex emotions :
Antithesis—suggested but not expressed.
The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd.
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy ;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
Definite Antithesis.
Cowards die many times before their death,
The valiant never taste of death but once :
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should
fear,
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come, when it will come.
Irony.
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable,
What private griefs they have, alas ! I know not
That made them do it: they are wise and
honourable
And will no doubt with reason answer you.
Word Pictures
The following selections should be read
carefully through in silence and a definite
effort made to visualize the scene and the
movement; the imagination should dwell
upon each scene until thought and feeling
have recreated it within the mind. Then an

attempt should be made to render these
impressions aloud. Notice how the sequence
of particular sounds, the choice of long or
short vowels, the drag upon the lines by long
vowels and vocal consonants, or the lightness
of short vowels, all help to paint the pictures.
Analyse the sounds in the five lines, “By the
margin willow-veil'd," and this fact becomes
very apparent. The reader or reciter must
have such control over his instrument and the
notes he strikes that every detail of the poet's
imagery is expressed.
I sprang to the stirrup and Jorris and he ;
I galloped, Dirk galloped, we galloped all three.
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea ;
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way.
The sun's rim dips, the stars rush out,
At one stride comes the dark.
By the margin willow-veil'd
Slide the heavy barges trail'd
By slow horses; and unhailed
The shallop flitteth silken-sailed
Skimming down to Camelot.
And slowly, slowly, more and more,
The moony vapour rolling round the king
Who seem'd the phantom of a giant in it
Enwound him fold by fold, and made him grey
And greyer, till himself became as mist
Before her, moving ghost-like to his doom.

Two craggy rocks projecting to the main
The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain :
Within, the waves in softer murmurs glide,
And ships, secure, without their hawsers ride.
There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men ;
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage bell ;
But hush ! hark ! a deep sound strikes like a
rising knell!
Now came still evening on, and twilight grey
Had in her sober liv'ry all things clad.
Silence accompanied : for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale :
She, all night long, her am'rous descant sung.
Silence was pleas'd. Now glow'd the firmament
With living sapphires : Hesperus, that led
The starry host, rode brightest; till the moon,
Rising in clouded majesty, at length
Apparent queen, unveil'd her peerless light,
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged
Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,
And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great
brand
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,
And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an
arch,
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,

Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
By night, with noises of the northern sea.
So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur :
But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he
walk'd,
Larger than human on the frozen hills.
He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.
Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves
And barren chasms, and all to left and right
The bare black cliffs clang'd round him, as he
based
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels
And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,
And the tem glories of the winter moon.
