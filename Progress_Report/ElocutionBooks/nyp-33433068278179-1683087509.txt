PREFACE.
The design of the present work, is, as intimated in the title, to
furnish a manual of elocution, prepared with 'particular reference
to the purposes of the pulpit.
The author's previous publications, — the American Elocutionist,
and the volume on Orthophony, are intended for general use, in all
literary establishments in which elocution forms a department of
instruction. These two manuals furnish, it is thought, all the requi-
site means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the principles of
elocution, either in a practical or a scientific form, at the option
of the student.
The Orthophony prescribes the elementary discipline by which
to train the organs to vigor and pliancy, and to mould the voice, in
adaptation to the various modes of expressive utterance. It fur-
nishes a series of elementary lessons on the systematic cultivation of
the voice, — adapted to the theory and nomenclature of Dr. Rush.
It includes, also, the methods of instruction, and the forms of exer-
cise, introduced by Mr. J. E. Murdoch, in his system of “vocal
gymnastics,” along with those which are used by the author of the
present volume, in his modes of practical training.
The Elocutionist presents, more particularly, the correct pronunci-
ation of words, and the application of the rules of elocu'ion, in con-
nection with rhetoric and prosody. It comprises a course of practi-
cal instruction in enunciation, infection, emphasis rhetorical pauses,
expressive tone, and the rudiments of ges'ure
The general principles of elocution, howerer, as a science, and
its practice, as an art, need particular modification, to accommodate
them to the appropriate purposes of professional culture, for stu-

a
dents of theology. The style of voice, adapted to the correct and
impressive reading of a hymn, the Scriptures, or a sermon, requires
special attention and study, and a separate course of practice. The
delivery of a discourse from the pulpit, demands an appropriate
training, distinct from that of popular oratory. - The materials and
che suggestions for such cultivation, the present volume is designed
to supply.
The plan on which the contents of the following pages, are ar-
ranged, embraces,
1st, Introductory Observations on the importance of Elocution,
as a department of Theological Study.
2d, Remarks on the effect of Manner, in Voice and Gesture, as
exemplified in the pulpit.
3d, A brief Summary of the most important Principles of Elocu-
tion, with particular reference to their exemplification in the read-
ing of the Scriptures, hymns, and sermons.
4th, Exercises in these forms of reading, selected and arranged
for the particular application of rules and principles.
5th, A brief statement of the Principles of Gesture.
6th, Miscellaneous Extracts, for practice in Reading and Speak-
ing, intended to be analyzed by the student, and classified, in their
various contents, under the points of practical elocution which they
illustrate.

PRELIMINARY HINTS
ON MODES OF PERSONAL TRAINING,
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE USE OF THIS VOLUME.
INDIVIDUALS who have not convenient access to instruction, and are
desirous of prosecuting the study and practice of elocution, as a matter
of self-cultivation, may be aided by the following suggestions.
1. The preliminary condition to success in the cultivation of any
branch of practical oratory, is a healthy condition of the bodily frame. El-
ocution, as the exterior part of eloquence, is altogether dependent on the
vigor and flexibility of the muscular system. Flaccid, rigid, and clum.
sy muscles render expression by voice and action impracticable. Mus-
cular energy and pliancy demand habits of free exposure to the open
air, and the vigorous use of the arms and limbs, in daily exertions of
adequate force.
No man can be effectively eloquent without energy; and the attain-
ing of energy is, to the student and the sedentary man, a thing compar-
atively arduous. Several hours - not one, merely — of every day, are
due to the renovation of the body; and the student who tries to evade
this condition, although he may do well, apparently, for a few years,
usually sinks into debility, or contracts a decided perhaps a fatal –
bronchial affection. The sedentary man who is, at the same time, a
public speaker, needs a double allowance of air and exercise, to counter-
act the injurious tendency of the union of two modes of life naturally
incompatible. The nervous excitation, and the cerebral exhilaration,
arising from continued intellectual action, — by the deceptive inspira-
tion which they impart, — often lead the student to slight physical ex-
ercise, as a thing unnecessary. A few years, - sometimes even a few
months, are sufficient to undeceive the individual, and disclose all the
accumulation of unsuspected injury to which he had been subjecting
himself. The student is ever prone to forget that the body is a machine
designed for action, and one which he is bound to keep in use, and so
to keep in repair, — under a penalty not less severe than is attached to
a desecration. The statistics of elocution, however, if faithfully record-
ed, would not show a result, usually, of one sound voice in ten, among
young men who are addicted to sedentary and studious habits
An individual who wishes to acquire or retain the power of speaking
or reading with true effect, must, in the first instance, be willing to as-
sign a considerable portion of every day to invigorating exercise and
exposure.
2. It is, farther, an indispensable prerequisite to effective elocution
that the student accustom himself to activity, as a habit both of body and
mind. Expression, in elocutionary forms, is action: it is a thing utterly

-
course.
-
incompatible with listlessness, indolence, or languor. Eloquence, of
which elocution is but the audible and visible part, – implies a tendency
to perceptible effect. “ Wisdom” may be " the repose of minds." But
eloquence is not. The true orator has always defined eloquence as ac-
tion. Eloquence is not - in its effective form, - the placid lake, whose
charm is its serenity. It is the river “moving in majesty,” or sweeping
to its destination, and carrying with it whatever it encounters in its
The cloquence of calm thought and mild persuasion, has doubtless
its time and place. But even this demands its appropriate utterance
and action. Deprived of these it will lose its power. The discipline to
which the student, as a scholar, so long subjects himself, — the passive
and receptive state of mind to which he is habituated, — entail a ten-
dency to inaction, as regards manifestation and expressiou. When he
assumes, therefore, the duties of a profession which devolves on him, in
frequent recurrence, the act of public speaking, he is usually unprepared
for this altogether new career, in which his success depends not on his
power of reception or acquisition, but of impartation and utterance. He
must undergo a change of habit, as regards both mental and bodily ex-
ertion, to render him capable of accomplishing the purposes of active
life and professional duty. He must become habituated to the glow of
action, and the impulse of feeling; he must learn to cherish the inspira-
tion of ardor and positive exertion, and to relish the pleasure of impel-
ling other minds, of compassing an object, and carrying a point. His
speech must become fraught with the spirit of eloquence, in the earnest-
ness of its tenes, and the energy of its accompanying action; that he
may possess the power of moving his hearers and carrying them with
him. Such exertion will often demand all the spirit and enthusiasm of
heroic enterprise.
The student of elocution, then, must bring to his practice a stirring
ambition that shall not suffer him to subside into languor and indolence,
or irresolution and inaction. His daily physical exercise must be car-
ried to such extent as to yield the natural and healthful pleasure of ex-
ertion, and to create an earnest desire for it, and an habitual tendency
towards it.
3. But the successful practice of elocution demands more than mere-
ly high-toned health and habitual activity. Expression by voice and
action requires that natural result of healthful habit, which we designate,
in popular language, by the phrase "high animal spirits." This is one
of Nature's laws of expression. The individual in private society, not
less than the public speaker, needs animation, as condition of orul com.
milnication. The child, under the inspiration of vivid emotion, becomes
an eloquent monitor to the man, as regards the impartation of feeling.
The student of clocution, to be successful in his endeavors, needs all the
:ids arising from the inspiring influences of health and activity and ani-
mition. It is from the superabundant life of his own heart that he is to
i.pl and inspire the feelings of others. Expression, in its best forms,
is often sonething struck out in the glow of emotion. The most elo-
quent tones of the human voice, and the most impressive forms of atti-
tude ard action, are those which spring from the most vivid state of the
soul, under a powerful inspiration.
4. A high tone of the animal spirits, and a quick sensibility of heart
nccd, however, the associated aid of a plastic, and, at the same time a
powerfully active imagination. Poetry is not such to the man who re-
ceives it into a hard or a dormant fancy. To such an individual, its.no-

11
blest workings are but so many forms of falschood. Let him attempt
to give it voice, and his dry inexpressive tone reveals the fact that it
has no power over his being. The highest espressive action of the
human mind, is that in which eloquence, in its sublime inspirarion,
passes into the form of poetry. The art of elocution recognizes this
fact, and presents to the student, as the noblest of all its exercises, the
fitting recitation of sentiment embodied in verse, or in those forms of
prose which bespeak the presence of the spirit, if not the letter, of poetry:
To do justice to such strains, the student must bring to liis work the
utmost pliancy and glowing activity of imagination, to enable liim in
take on and give off, with correspondent cffect the " thick-coming tonn
cies" of the poet. He must possess the power of assimilaring his ow:
mood of mind to that of the creative ariist uuder whose inspiration las
is working. Every cential point of thought must be thrown oui, in
tone and action, in a style which clusters round it the wliole investing
imagery of the poet's soul and the speaker's heart. Poetic utterance
requires that imagination should people the world of feeling, not less
than that feeling should animate and awaken the world of fan«y. Elo-
quence, when it is truly such, partakes largely of the character of po-
etry: the most eloquent passage of writing is that which is essentially
the most poetical.
The student of elocution. then, if he would be successful in liis art,
must cherish whatever tends to impart life and power to the imagina-
tive faculty. Nature and art, and poetry, in particular, are the great
schools of imagination. But no influence is more immediate, in this
respect, than the attentive practice of elocution itself. A truc poetic
recitation breathes into the soul, at once, the conception of the poet, the
music of liis verse, and the charm of a harmonized living voice, io which
the heart strings are formed to thrill.
5. The effects resulting from the practice of clocution, are equally
favorable, as regards the best influence on the health and vigor and activity
of the organic frame, and on the habitual tone of fieling. The erect anil
expansive attiiude of body, and the free and forcible action of all its
parts, in the full expression of posture, motion, and gesture, tend to
impart vigor and pliancy, not less than freedom and grace; while the
unembarrassed and active play of heart and lungs conveys fresh life
and power to all parts of the system, from the energy imparted to the
muscles of the chest and throat. A highly animated condition of the
whole interior of the bodily frame, is a necessary consequence of the
vivid and genial emotions which inspiring sentiment and impressive
utterance produce.
6. The various modes of exercise in detail, which are most conducive
to healthful vigor and organic energy, may be found described in tlie
volume on Orthophony, which is more immediately occupied with this
branch of elocutionary training. The student, when he has rendered
himself expert in these, or others of a similar description, may, with ad.
vantage, proceed in the course of cul.ivation, as developed in that work,
and in the American Elocutionist. To the study of thicse volumes the
exercises commencing at the 130th page of the present work, will form
a useful sequel. Students who have not convenient access to the works
now mentioned, will, it is 1hought, find, in the exercises presented in
the following pages, a course of practice sufficient for immediate pur-
poses.
7. The practice of the elementary exercises, should be persevered in,
till every point, successively, is mastered, and the results of cultivation
a

are fully obtained in a perfectly pure, clear, round, and full Tone of
voice; a perfectly distinct and well-marked, but fluent Enunciation;
the power of giving forth, at pleasure, ary degree of Force, from whis-
pering to shouting and calling; every species of " Stress;” the ability
to exemplify any Pitch of voice, from the lowest to the highest; a per-
fect command of“ Inflections,” in all their forms; an entire control over
“Movement," from the slowest to the lively rate; an exact observance
of Time and “Rhythm;" every degree of effect in Emphasis, from the
most delicate to the boldest; a perfect mastery of " Expression,” in all
its moods, and of “ Variation,” through all its modifications.
8. A separate course of practice, in the reading of the Scriptures and of
hymns, should, after the previous training, be pursued, with the aid of
close analysis and frequent repetition, as exemplified in the following
pages.
9. The "miscellaneous exercises” should all be thoroughly analyzed, pre-
vious to practising them, and the style of reading penciled, if necessary,
on the margin, opposite to every passage which needs more than usual
attention to “expression” and variation.
10. The next step in the student's progress, should be the reading of
passages selected from various authors, exemplifying all the varieties of
style in narrative, descriptive, didactic, and oratorical composition in
prose, and of epic, iyric, and dramatic poetry.
11. The next step in preparatory training. should be the reading of
sermons, with strict regard to the due loudness and slowness of voice
required in public reading ; with a watchful attention to inflection,
emphasis, and pauses, as the vehicles of distinctive thought; and to
expression” and “ variation,” as the means of effect in sentiment and
cmotion. The best security for due closeness of attention to particu-
lars, is the preparatory use of the pencil in marking, on the margin and
between the lines, every important point in the management of the
voice.
"
12. The student should now adopt the practice of reading matter of his
own composition, in the form of essays, lectures, and sermons.
13. As a preparation for applying the principles of Gesture, passages
from the “ ELEMENTARY and the MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES," may
be committed to memory, and practised in the forms of declamation and
recitation.
14. The next step, in preparatory practice, should consist in speaking
on given subjects, after close and thorough premeditation, so as to develope
a train of thought in well-digested forms, leaving the language and ex-
pression, in their details, to the suggestion of the moment.
15. The last stage of elocutionary practice, may be left to exercises in
strictly extemporaneous speaking, in the form of discourses pronounced on
texts selected ad aperturam libri, as a preparation for the customary re-
marks on passages of Scripture, at prayer-meetings. When students
can conveniently meet, in classes, the practice of extemporaneous discus-
sion and debate may be advantageously adopted, as a means of cultiva-
ting propriety and fluency in elocution.

INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
STUDY OF ELOCUTION.
a
STUDENTS of theology are not always aware of the immense impor-
tance of a perfect command of voice, and of an intimate knowledge of
the rules and principles of elocution, as the only rational means to that
end. A teacher in this branch of education, therefore, has often to con
sumc much time in soliciting attention to his subject; and his argu-
ments are not unfrequently regarded as the pleading of one whose
personal interests are at stake in the question.
-
The author of the following treatise, labors, in common with other
instructors in his department, under this disadvantage, and has found
it useful to appeal, on this ground, to the testimony of individuals al-
ready engaged in the duties of the sacred profession. He was desirous,
therefore, previous to commencing the task of compiling this volume,
to obtain, — from those whose professional position and opportunities
might give sanction to their opinions, — their views on the advantages
of specific study and practice in elocution, as a part of professional
training for the services of the pulpit.
Several clergymen to whom the author made application, on this
subject, expressed a warm interest in the object in view, and their readi-
ness to render it their personal aid. The urgency of profcssional du-
ties, however, in some instances, and unforeseen hinderances, in others,
have prevented the fulfilment of their wishes.* The author takes pecu-
liar pleasure in acknowledging the effectual aid which, in the following
instances, has been so liberally afforded to his undertaking. The sen-
timents of such individuals, will carry their own commendation to every

THE ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.
[Contributed by the Rev. Dr. Edwards A. Park, Professor in Andover
Theological Seminary.)
Tue Author of our being has made the various organs
of the body expressive of thought and emotion. The eye,
the cheek, the lip, the hand, the foot, the attitude of the
limbs and chest and head, may all show forth a sentiment
of the soul. It is a singular fact, that the choicest selec-
tion of words will sometimes fail to exhibit a certain cast
of thought, which may be indicated at once by the natural
signs consisting in certain movements and appearances of
the physical organs. In the person of Garrick, a mere
position of the elbow or the knee, yea, a particular adjust-
ment of the hair, has vividly portrayed a state of mind
which artificial language is too inflexible to express.
Written words, even when they embody the general
idea, the substantial meaning, are often unable to ex-
hibit those evanescent shades of sentiment which are
clearly expressed by tones and gestures. The inflection
with which a word is uttered, conveys sometimes a delicate
thought, which the word itself does not even intimate.
Now this natural expressiveness of the human frame is an
essential concomitant of oral language. It is the first in-
strument which man uses in order to communicate his
thoughts, for he knows the meaning of signs before that
of articulate phrases; and it is his last resort when speech
fails him.
Our Creator never intended, that we should utter our
words without the appropriate tones and the corroborative
appearances of the body. These accompaniments of speech
are as necessary to its full effect, as animal life is needful
for the completeness of physical beauty. There can be no
perfect speech without them. The imperfect manner in
which they are frequently exhibited, results from that ob-
tuseness of sensibility, that indolence of mind, that igno-
rance of the fitness of things, that want of executive power,
which are remote consequences of our apostate moral con-

dition. A complete orator must be a completely holy man;
and our natural selfishness has superinduced such habits
of thought and feeling as make us awkward and inexpert
in our attempts to express what passes within our minds.
The various developments of affectation are the result of
our pride and love of display; the different forms of dull-
ness in our speech are occasioned by that callous sensibility
which the Bible denominates hardness of heart."
The natural language of the human body, being indis-
pensable to the full effect of arbitrary language, is, of
course, an essential accompaniment of all earnest address.
A proper use of this natural language, is involved in a
good elocution; and such an elocution is thus a constitu-
ent part of the preaching of the gospel. A man would not
be considered as preaching the word which maketh wise
unto salvation, if he should proclaim it in an unknown
tongue, or in any such manner as would render it unintel-
ligible; if, for instance, he should make no pauses at the
end of sentences, and should let his voice fall at those
words only which cannot be understood unless uttered with
a rising inflection; if he should use the interrogative tones
for affirmative remarks, and the exclamatory accent for
the simplest didactic phrase. This might be trifling with
the gospel, or disfiguring it, but not preaching it. Now a
poor elocution does make certain portions of the proclaimed
word unintelligible. It fails to express those delicate
shades of thought, which are elementary parts of the gos-
pel itself. It suggests positive ideas, which the words
ut-
tered do not mean, and which are sometimes hostile to the
whole spirit of divine truth. The most injurious impres-
sions have been produced, by what are technically called
“immoral tones," in the utterance of Christian doctrine.
It is evident, then, that a good elocution in the pulpit is
as really important as any elocution at all. If it be useful
to preach the gospel, then it is useful to preach it so that
it will be understood and felt. If its truths ought to be
expressed, they ought to be expressed fully and properly.
To proclaim them, and yet adopt such a manner as will
obscure or pervert their meaning, and blunt their force, is
to do and to undo a thing at the same time. The advan-

a
tages resulting from a true, natural elocution, in the pulpit,
are the same with the advantages of Christian doctrine well
exhibited. The evils ensuing from a false, unnatural elo-
cution, are the same with the evils of misrepresenting the
word of God. He who undervalues the right method of
enunciating religious truth, undervalues also the niceties
of sentiment, the delicate mouldings of thought, which are
a constituent portion of that truth; and which are lost
from the view, when a preacher's elocution hides behind
itself the ideas which ought to be delivered to his hearers.
An affected delivery is often a delivery of mere words,
often words conveying a thought never intended by the
speaker.
If, then, the preaching of the gospel be the appropriate
enunciation of divine truth, we see why it was ordained as
the chief means of impressing this truth upon the mind.
The Deity might have required, that his word should be
merely read in silence, or that it should be repeated in a
whisper from a single individual to another, or that it should
be only chanted or sung. But he chose to ordain that it
should be preached, i. e. uttered in the appropriate style,
by a sacred orator to a listening congregation. Long be-
fore the New Testament was committed to writing, were
its truths impressed upon the public mind by the living
voice of the presbyter. He who made man, knew what
was in man. He knew those latent sensibilities of the
soul, which can be touched by nothing so well as by truth
eloquently spoken. The means for our spiritual renova-
tion he thus wisely adapted to the principles of our nature.
Hence when his word is preached, as it ought to be, in an
earnest and emphatic manner, it produces a peculiar effect
upon the soul. It acquires a mcaning which it does not
seem to possess upon
the writen When a Whitefield
utters the words, “ Oh! wretched man that I am,” they
have an intensity of expression which a silent reader will
not perceive. The power of those and of many similar
phrases, is communicated, in some degree, by their con-
ventional signs; in some degree, by the tones which are
their life ;- by the speaking eye, the flushed face, the

Being endued with physical and spiritual susceptibilities,
man is the most deeply impressed when an appeal is made
to both parts of his sentient nature; when the
eye
and the
ear are delighted, as well as the mind and heart. And
such is the sympathy between the corporeal and the men-
tal
powers,
that when the former are in a state of appro-
priate excitement, the latter act with increased vigor and
success. The soul perceives the more of truth, and feels
it the more keenly, when the eye traces the lineaments of
this truth upon the countenance of the speaker, and the
ear catches the vibrations of it from lips which have been
touched as with a live coal from off the altar.
Valerius Maximus says of the Athenian orator, that “a
great part of Demosthenes is wanting, for it must be heard
and not read.” Quintilian says of Hortensius, that “there
was something in him which strangely pleased when he
spoke, which those who perused his orations could not find.”
The younger Pitt remarked that he could never conjecture,
from reading his father's speeches, where their eloquence
lay hidden. And there have been thousands of preachers,
who uttered truths which no stenographer could seize;
which no ready writer, with a command of the most exten-
sive vocabulary, could transfer to the silent page, for they
were truths that beamed from the
eye,
and were breathed
out in the tones of the voice, and were visible in the ges-
ture, but could not be circumscribed within arbitrary sym-
bols.
Conventional terms form the body of the preacher's ut-
terance; but the soul of it is that natural language which
God has made indispensable to the life-giving power of
artificial speech. The ordinance of preaching, then, is no
arbitrary appointment of Heaven. It was wisely chosen,
as the means most philosophically adapted to impress the
mind with religious truth. The more perfect the preach-
ing is, so much the more exquisite is its adaptation to pro-
Cuce the intended effect. Other things being equal, that
sumon will be the most efficacious which is delivered in
to best manner. The very principle, on which the preach-
::: of the gospel is more useful than the publication of it
from the press, makes a natural and expressive style of

preaching it more useful than a style which does not cor-
respond with the demands of the subject. The very rea-
son, for which God requires us to preach the word, makes
it necessary to preach it well, to speak according to the
best rules of elocution, which are no other than the rules.
prescribed by nature, by the God of nature.
Much of that which passes under the name of preaching,
does not deserve the name. It may
be called a
poor
kind
of singing, a tedious method of drawling, a soporific way
of reading, but it is not the living utterance of such thought
as enkindles the eye, the gushing forth of those emotions
which cannot be fully expressed except in the forms of
eloquence. One reason why preaching is less effective
than we should antecedently expect it to be, is the fact
that there is less of it than we ordinarily suppose. All
the dull, clumsy, turgid, weak, insipid, and in any way
affected methods of delivery, are to be subtracted from the
sum total of what is denominated preaching; and then
how small is the remainder!
God will honor the laws which he has made, and will
manifest his displeasure toward the violation of these laws.
The true rules of elocution are established by the Author
of our being, and will not be obeyed without advantage nor
disobeyed without loss; and no preacher can regard him-
self as serving God, or doing good to man, in the act of
contravening the laws of speech. He may be useful in
spite of his opposition to nature and providence, but not
by means of that opposition. Truth ill administered may
do good ; truth well administered will do more.
prieties of the administration add a power to the truth;
the improprieties of the administration take a power away
from it.
It has long been a desire of good men, to make the ser-
vices of the sanctuary as attractive as possible. Music,
and architecture, and painting, and sculpture have all im-
parted of their fascinations to the exercises of worship.
Every age has witnessed the invention of some new rite,
or the restoration of one that had become obsolete. New
measures and strange measures have made their appeal to
the fancy of men, and have charmed it for a time. But

the chief outward attraction of public worship has been too
much overlooked. The great majority of nominal Chris-
tians have preferred the gorgeousness of a ceremonial
above the eloquence of the pulpit. And yet none of the
fine arts is so attractive as eloquence. The most philo-
sophical skeptic whom the English world has seen, declared
that he would travel twenty miles to hear the preaching of
a certain Methodist minister.
There is something in the voice of an orator, that
answers to a demand of the soul. By the flashes of his
eye, the heart of an audience is inflamed ; and men are
sometimes spell-bound by the upraising of his hand. Wheth-
er they love or hate the truth which is addressed to them,
they are enamored of the form in which it appears. Many
an obnoxious doctrine of the Bible lies imbedded in a sweet
historical narrative, which allures even such as dislike the
doctrine. The casket may enclose a pearl, which is less
highly prized than the gold in which it is encased. But
thousands who come to admire the wining elocution, re-
main to adore the great Being whose character is so appro-
priately described. It is the genius of Romanism to raise
the orchestra and the parade of the altar above the pulpit.
Only a small proportion of its priests have cultivated the
art of speaking. They have but little encouragement to
The forms of Christian worship most prevalent
throughout the world, have tended to withdraw the mind
from the proper methods of proclaiming divine truth. Men
have been allured into the sanctuary by less intellectual
and more artificial attractions, than those of a racy and
graceful eloquence. It is, or must we say, it should be
the glory of the pulpit, to restore the appropriate allure-
ments to Christian worship; to fascinate men by thoughts
well attired, well exlibited. The mind was made for
thought, and will be pleased with it longer than with any
external ornament. And thought expressed, is thought
still. The enunciation of it increases its influence over the
soul. There never was an age so intellectual as the pres-
ent. Our lyceums have well nigh supplanted our theatres.
It is then a great mistake to spend our time in decorating
our ceremonials of worship, when the taste of the age ro-
do so.

quires something more spiritual and refined than mere
pageantry. It requires a more copious supply of facts and
arguments and illustrations than is now to be found, and a
more interesting manner of exhibiting them.
If we would meet the demands of our time, and, indeed,
of all times, we must prefer those ornaments which are the
natural and appropriate dress of truth, to those which are
factitious and far-fetched. The graces of elocution are
those which belong to the truth itself. The expressiveness
of attitudes and gestures and tones, is nature. It flows
from the mind. It is the result of the inspiration of thought.
Statues and pictures and robes are artificial adornings of
the temple ; but the apostle who “ cannot but speak the
things which he hath seen and heard,” will be a permanent
as well as an appropriate attraction to the sanctuary; and
men who would soon be satiated with the chauntings of the
matins and the vespers, will come again and again to hear
the preacher who speaks like one anointed to publish glad
tidings.
Let it not be said, that this mode of speaking is the result
of divine grace. The gifts of the Spirit never supersede
the necessity of assiduous culture. Nor let it be said, that
an effective elocution must be a natural endowment. God
bestows upon men the faculties, which are to be improved
by laborious training. All men cannot be orators, but the
majority of men may be. The majority of men are elo-
quent, when they speak for their selfish interests. It is a
corrupt habit, which has made our speakers so sluggish;
and now cultivation is required in order to restore the
nature which has been expelled by evil practice.
The elocutionist labors not to make men artificial, but
to make them cease from being so; not to mend or trans-
form nature, but to restore and develop it. He labors to
repress the intrusions of a proud, selfish spirit into the
,
style of a preacher; to excite the dormant energies of a
mind, which has been in the habit of contemplating truth
with indifference; to rectify the depraved tastes of de-
praved men; and to teach those subordinate graces of
utterance, which would never have been forgotten if man
had not been sluggish, regardless of his influence over

others, unmindful of his accountability to Heaven for every
gift which he has received. In fine, the elocutionist labors
to make the preacher natural, and therefore impressive,
and thus attractive. The naturalness is to be the proper
expression of the truth; the impressiveness is to be the
legitimate effect of the thought fitly uttered ; and the at-
tractiveness is to be the alluring influence, which the purity
and firmness and and grandeur of the word of God always
exert upon a soul that is attuned to the love of holiness, or
even awake to the beauties of intellect.
THE STUDY OF ELOCUTION, AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THE PREPARATION REQUIRED BY THE PUB-
LIC DUTIES OF THE MINISTRY.
(Contributed by the Rev. Edward N. Kirk, pastor of the Mount Vernon
Church, Boston.]
It is easy to recognize the difference between a speaker
who is agreeable and one who is disagreeable, between one
who is powerful and another who is feeble. Nor can any
one entertain a doubt whether that difference is just as
obvious in the pulpit as in the senate. Every preacher
would desire so to deliver his sermon as that his meaning
should be clearly perceived and his sentiments deeply felt,
rather than to utter it in a manner unintelligible and un-
impressive. Every congregation of worshippers would
prefer in their pastor a good delivery, to an awkward and
disagreeable style of speaking. Let two men of equal
piety and scholarship be presented to any of our religious
societies; the one a man of easy, becoming carriage in
the pulpit, of simple, natural, and powerful utterance; the
other uncouth in attitude and movement, indistinct and
stammering in his enunciation, and wearisome in his drawl-
ing tones ; can any man in his senses doubt, which of the
two will be chosen ? No; thus far the case is plain. But

a
practising in the detail of his studies and vocal gymnasti
there we shall find some demurring. Many who admi
the orator, are averse to the process of discipline whi
gave him the better style. There is, in other words, a
prejudice in the community, and among many excellent
candidates for the gospel ministry, in regard to elocution
as an art to be obtained by study and practice.
This prejudice is worthy of a candid examination and of
an earnest effort to remove it. In the minds of some, he
study and practice of elocution is connected, if not identi-
fied with the idea of substituting sound and emotion for
sense and truth. To such persons it may be suggested
that there is no necessity for this substitution. The im-
portance of elocution presupposes the importance of other
things. If a preacher have not the right things to say,
and the right motives and spirit in uttering them, manner
can do nothing for him nor his hearers. But for men who
are morally and intellectually qualified to preach the gos-
pel, the importance of manner can scarcely be overrated.
And to overlook it is a proof neither of piety, dignity, nor
wisdom. If there were some ethereal way of communicat-
ing with the mind ; if the process of preaching were de-
signed to be mesmeric; and people were to be put to sleep,
instead of being aroused, in order to instruct and impress
them, we might dispense with elocution and the culture it
requires. But so long as men are in the body, it will be
found requisite for the most effective exercise of the min-
istry, that a part of clerical education consist in the study
and practice of oratory. That necessity is founded on
these two facts, that the communication of thought and
feeling depends upon the right exercise of our bodily or-
gans; and that those organs are within the domain of that
great law which requires the cultivation of the faculties.
It is not sufficient for the purposes of electrical power that
the battery be fully charged; a good conductor must be
added. Alas! how much preaching is in the class of non-
conductors. Elocution is indeed vanity and vexation of
spirič in a man who has no other excellence; but it multi-
plies indefinitely the power of him who possesses the solid
qualities of the ministry.

In the minds of others, elocution is identified with the
ostentatious exhibition of the parts and graces of the
speaker. But this is confounding the use and the abuse
of a good thing. Since it is a man who is to be seen and
heard, and since there is but one right way of speaking,
while there are a thousand wrong ways, the man will do
well to learn the right. And if the agreeable impression
produced by an agreeable person and manner, can conduce
to the right impression of truth, the very purity of his de-
sire to do good, should induce him to cultivate his person
and his manner. There is nothing in the study of elocu-
tion peculiarly adapted to awaken vanity. Nor is there
any more inducement for an eloquent man to make display
his end, than for a learned man.
Others fear that they shall be tempted to turn their at-
tention in the pulpit, to gestures and tones ; and thus in-
finitely degrade their high vocation. This again is a pos-
sible, but by no means a necessary consequence.
It is a
perversion of oratory. There is no more need of bringing
the rules of oratory into the pulpit, than the rules of gram-
mar or rhetoric. Both must be studied, and both must
exercise a powerful influence in the pulpit; but neither
must be seen there, for an instant diverting the current
of thought or feeling in the speaker. The greatest orator,
in an extemporaneous address, pays strict attention to the
minutest rules of grammar. In constructing a long and
complex sentence, he observes with scrupulous cxactness
the bearing of grammatical rules upon the inflection and
position of each word; but there is no interruption in all
this to the concentrated action of his understanding, no
extinction of the fiery current of his feeling. The rules of
elocution are designed to form the man, to correct the bad
habits of attitude, speech, and gesture, to make the body,
in every way, the fit instrument for a mind full of noble
thoughts and powerful emotions. There may be cases of
half-fledged orators or of pedantic speakers turning the
rostrum or the pulpit into the platform of a school, and
showing off the attitudes and tones and gestures which
they admire as mere attitudes, tones, and gestures. But
all this, we repeat, is perversion, equally disgusting with

C
the parade or sholarship or any other form of pedantry in
the sacred place, but no more a reason against the study
of elocution than against that of Hebrew or rhetoric.
The considerations in favor of this study are so obvious,
that we seem to be uttering common-places in presenting
them. But
But since it is evident that these considerations
have not yet produced their proper effect on our students
of theology ; since we are still compelled to witness the
bodily distortions, the croakings and jerkings and scream-
ings, the false emphasis, and the unmeaning modulations
which now are, to some extent, eclipsing the brightest
lights of the American pulpit, - we feel compelled to utter
common-place truths.
We design, then, to show that good speaking is better
than bad speaking, that propriety in speaking is more
proper than impropriety. And if our chapter appears to
be unworthy of a place in this work, let it be set down to
the fact that men, wise men, need to be told such obvious
truths, as when written, appear childish.
A preacher of the gospel is to perform the most impor-
tant of his ministerial services in the pulpit. Within that
sacred enclosure he spends some of the most important
hours of his life. There he exhausts his physical energies ;
there he strikes the chord that shall vibrate in the joys or
sorrows of his hearers, forever. In every view of the case,
then, the best mode of occupying the pulpit, and of exer-
cising his functions in it, cannot be unimportant. If there
be a way of diminishing the weariness of the speaker; if
there be a way of preventing some of the disastrous physi-
cal effects of public speaking, surely a wise man will not
think the matter beneath his notice. If there be one way
of standing and speaking more agreeable to an audience
than another, surely a benevolent man will choose the
better way. And much more if there be a way of making
one's self better understood, and one's sentiments more
deeply felt by an audience, no honest preacher can under-
value the instruction that will make him to know it, nor
the discipline by which he may attain to it. But all these
things are capable of demonstration. If we begin with the
least important, the ease and health of the preacher; we

may see that a speaker who has learned to stand in the
pulpit on two feet, will be less fatigued, at the end of an
Lour, than if he has been limping and hopping on one foot,
as we have seen preachers do; twining one limb around
the other, as the ivy embraces the oak. By the disastrous
effects of public speaking, we mean the derangement of
the functions of the throat and chest. There is a mode of
employing the vocal muscles, which seriously and need-
lessly wastes the nervous energy of the system, inflames
the membrane of the throat and the delicate structure of
the bronchia. All this could be avoided by learning to
use the muscles that were designed for the purpose, and
so to speak, that the respiration and pulsation and vocal
utterance shall move in harmony; and an hour's speaking
will then be, for the body, merely a healthful exercise.
This is not exaggeration. The recent experience of some
preachers, who, by proper exercises have totally recovered
the use of their vocal powers, and have learned to speak
with an ease to which they were formerly strangers in the
pulpit, confirms it. A young minister will find difficulties
enough in his work, to make the diminution of those which
are merely physical, a matter of some moment to him.
Nor do we deem it unworthy of a preacher's attention
that he should remove everything unnecessarily disagree-
able from his speaking, and add to it everything that is
adapted to satisfy the refined taste of his hearers. When
Cowper expresses his abhorrence of the start theatric
practiced at the glass," all the world approves the censure,
because all the world understands him to mean the affected
and contemptible exhibition of one's self as the object of
admiration to an assembly, who are waiting to hear a mes-
sage from God. There certainly is neither piety nor power
in clownishness. And it cannot be denied that if some
speakers had practised their attitudes and starts before
glass, they would never have inflicted them on their hear-
ers. It is true, that people of good taste will bear much
from the pulpit, which, in the parlor, would seem to them
offensive. But there is an evident impropriety and disad-
vantage in so taxing their respect for the office and its
incumbent. The preacher is often called to speak unpal-

atable truths. There is thus a sufficient degree of offen-
sivenes in his employment, to spare him from superadding
that which may arise from uncouth positions and motions
of the body, grimaces and frowns, monotony and false em-
phasis. An audience is often wcaried under a sermon full
of sound sense, distinctive remarks, and the fervent spirit
of piety. They often associate with a preacher of sterling
excellence some uncomfortable feelings. They know not
why; for he is a good man, a sensible man, a man of true
piety, and a good theologian. The true reason is, that he
wearics the car.
The mind of every hearer is so constituted, that variety
pleases, and monotony wearies it. This is true of the body
also. The muscles of the limbs, the organs of taste, the
eye, the car, all demand variety. And while the highest
moral effect from discourse, demands unity, this law of the
mind requires, at the same time, variety in unity. This
principle should control alike the thought, the style, and
the delivery. The unity of delivery depends upon the
pitch and general current of the voice ; the variety de-
pends not only upon the occasional variation of pitch and
direction, but up on another circumstance which we would
briefly explain. The spoken English language contains
upwards of forty distinct sounds. Ecme of them are very
grateful to the ear; and all of them together make the
music of our language. Now it generally happens that
every uncultivated speaker fails to utter several of them;
and usually those which are the most musical. He like-
wise gives those which he does employ, too much in the
same mould. Indolence has made every one pronounce
his words as much alike as is consistent with being under-
stcod. Hence it results that some of the most musical
sounds of our language, are not heard from the lips of
many speakers; and instead of more than forty, uttered
in their varicd combinations, we are confined to a greater
or less number below this. The hearers do not know why,
but thcir minds seldom continue aroused to the end of
some discourses, when they know, at the same time, that
the preacher thinks well and writes well. The monotony
of sound itself is suficient to account for it. To overcome

a
this indolent and inelegant habit, requires the careful cul-
tivation of the ear, to distinguish these sounds, and of the
vocal organs to utter them with precision and purity.
But these considerations are still inferior to another,
which is, that the perspicuity and impressiveness of a dis-
course require a correct delivery. The shades of thought
in the mind depend for their correct expression, not merely
upon words, but also upon the mode of pronouncing them.
It scarcely needs to be repeated here that a bad emphasis
may make a true statement become a falsehood. It is not
merely the tongue that speaks; the whole frame utters a
language definite and powerful. The moment a speaker
'
rises before an audience, he makes an impression. His
attitude is a language. If he be a man of true dignit;,
.
and his soul be elevated by the noblest sentiments, he may,
for want of a proper cultivation of his body, produce the
contrary impression on his hearers. An erect attitude is
dignified, and becomes no man more than him who ap-
proaches his fellows with messages from God. And every
man of true dignity should accustom his body to correspond
to his mind, and not to belie it. Physical uprightness is
not an unbecoming representative and expression of moral
rectitude. There is more moral effect on an audience in a
posture which presents the expanded front, than in the
side-posture of a fencing-master. There is also more
power in the gestures which are made by a body firmly
sustained, than by one which reels upon its base. The
voice, too, is capable of countless inflections, each one of
which is itself a language to the soul. Every shade of
sentiment in a discourse has an appropriate modulation of
the voice; and if that modulation be not made, that senti-
ment must lie buried in the bosom of the speaker: the
hearer fails, just so far, to participate in it. With many
preachers, the exercise of reading the Scriptures and the
hymns, appears to be a mere form. This is a great loss
to their hearers. The reading of the Scriptures by Dr.
John Mason, was said to be a commentary on them. The
reading of the hymns by Mr. Nettleton, was often a ser-
mon to the assembly:

tion not be received, of the importance of cultivating clocu-
tion. Let it then be repeated, that the powers of utter-
ance come under the great law of education, which pertains
to the entire man. No physical function of man is capa-
ble of greater improvement than the voice. Its compass,
its musical quality, its distinctness, its flexibility, its deli-
cate utterance of sentiment, admit of indefinite improve-
ment. The oratorical taste, too, can be cultivated to a
very high degree, so that the body shall enter into the
most delica e sympathy with the mind and heart, and
faithfully symbolize to cvery other eye and ear all the
wonderful workings of the spiritual man. The age of
miracles is past.
And since “it has pleased God, by
the foolishness of preaching to save ” men; and since
preaching employs organs and faculties which we find to
be capable of so great improvement, we must believe that
God will employ a preacher who has cultivated his orato-
rical powers, to do a greater amount of good by preaching,
than another of equal piety and learning, who has neglected
this cul.ivation. From the present style of the pulpit and
the senate, one might suppose that the age of eloquence is

tions, we believe that three things are demanded for the

thorough cultivation of the functions of speech.

ELOCUTION,
AS A
DEPARTMENT OF PREPARATORY STUDY IN THEOLOGY.
[By the Author of the present volume.]
The preceding observations will, no doubt, be received
with that full weight of effect, which justly belongs to the
sources from which they come. Nor would the author
feel disposed to present his own thoughts on the subject,
were it not for the necessity of meeting objections such
as he hears frequently offered to the systematic study of
elocution, as either unnecessary or injurious.
A teacher in the department of elocution, has to com-
municate with minds under every variety of impression
on the subject of culture. He meets, occasionally, with
students whose lack of self-confidence, and even of a just
self-reliance, leads them to despair of effecting anything
in the way of successful cultivation, even after the most
resolute and persevering exertions. He finds, sometimes,
on the other hand, those whose self-esteem induces a
perfect satisfaction with their habitual manner, be it what
it may, and who are confident that they need little aid
from any source but what is within themselves. He
sees, perhaps, one individual who has formed an undue
estimation of mere tuition and preparatory training, and
who evidently expects too much from such aids, and sub-
jects himself too passively to mere processes; and another
who, from superficial attention to the merits of the ques-
tion, or from prejudice or whim, contemns cultivation, as
a thing wholly supererogatory, or necessarily artificial and
false, or, at best, but mechanical and external.

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
An instructor has therefore to urge, on some minds, the
value and importance of the processes of culture in this
department of education, and to dwell on things familiar
or self-evident to other minds.
The objections to systematic training in elocution, espe-
cially with reference to the purposes of the pulpit, are
often founded on notions apparenily just, or, certainly,
quite plausible. Standing on the broad ground that the
great point in expression, is the utterrance of feeling, the
objector maintains that nothing else is requisite, - that
no rule can be required, when feeling is genuine, - that
what a man feels deeply he must express strongly and
truly, and therefore eloquently, - that to propose the idea
of referring to a rule, when under an impulse of emotion,
is absurd, — that utterance modified by rule is but an arti-
ficial mimicry of emotion, - that the idea of one man
learning of another how to express his own feelings, is
ridiculous, – that, if a speaker really has anything to say,
he will easily find the way to say it.
But alas! the eloquent nullifier of cultivation, is, per-
haps, in the meantime, uttering his very objections in the
nasal tone which habit has made second nature and truth
to him, but which, to one unaccustomed to hear the tones
of the human voice assimilated to the twanging of a poor
performer on the violin, is capable of exciting no emotions
but those of the risible order: or he is emitting his voice
with the guttural tones which, sometimes, make man ap-
proach the quadruped, in his utterance; he is articulating
his words so imperfectly, that one syllable obliterates
another; or he is marking his emphasis with a double
twist of intensity, which seems to verify, on the spot, the
half-malicious assertion of Dickens, that “the Americans
search out every unaccented syllable in a word, to give it
an accent, and every unemphatic word in a sentence, to
clap an emphasis upon it;” and, from want of natural
or acquired ear for the character of vocal tone,
perhaps, all the while, using a coarse violence of voice,
- he is,

which makes his earnestness become the vehemence of
an angry dispute. The opponent of cultivation forgets,
in fact, that the radical doctrine of no culture, is true only
on condition that natural and acquired habits are perfect
in the community in which an individual is educated, and
consequently in himself.
But, even suppose such a state of things to exist, a
generous and truly philosophic view of human culture,
would lead to a very different conclusion, as we see in
the practice of the ancient Athenians — that people so
exquisitely perfect in physical organization, so quick and
susceptible in ear, so delicate and true in taste, so vivid
in feeling, so poetic in imagination, so subtle and refined
in intellect, so intensely ardent in temperament, so ex-
pressive, so eloquent, in speech and action. It was that
very people, -so endued with every grace of nature and
every accomplishment of art, - that carried the systematic
study of eloquence, and the artistic discipline of voice
and person, tone, look, attitude, and action, to the highest
point of cultivation, - that left no expedient untried, by
which thought and emotion might be most efficaciously
addressed to the mind, through the appointed avenues of
-
sense.
The raw youth who is objecting to cultivation, as some-
thing that will mar the symmetry or impair the originality
of his genius, forgets that the two most eloquent of men,
Demosthenes, among the Greeks, and Cicero, among
the Romans, were the most assiduous, the most rigo-
rous, the most literal self-cultivators, in the humblest and
minutest details of practical elocution.
Surely, if ever there was a community in which sys-
tematic discipline might have been dispensed with, it was
that of Athens, whose humblest citizen was daily listen-
ing to the eloquence of Demosthenes, to the tragedies of
Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; living in the daily
vision of architectural structures Ike the Parthenon, and
of sculptures such as those of Phidias; listening to a

music worthy of these sister arts, or to the recitation of
the “rhapsodies” of Homer. But it was in that very
community that oratory had its diversified orders of schools
and seminaries, for the formation of the voice, and for the
moulding of the body.
The superficial, popular objection, that the Grecian cul-
ture was fastidious, minute and fanciful, is wholly gratui-
tous. Men such as Demosthenes and Cicero could not
have submitted to a fantastic discipline. The former
stands acknowledged the strongest and manliest specimen
of mind, that history has preserved to us; the latter, the
most practical in tendency, and the most various in power,
character, and accomplishment. The indefatigable self-
culture of the former, and its sanction by the practice of
the latter, — when himself in Greece, are facts against
which it is vain to dispute.
How then can we regard the presumption of him who,
without study, and without practice, assumes the duties
of an oilice which implies the power of persuasive and
impressive discourse on the highest themes of thought,
the noblest relations of being, and the profoundest emo-
tions of the soul? The prince of Roman orators regarded
the prelusive tremor of anxiety as an indispensable token
of the earnest speaker at the judiciary tribunal, - what a
-
reproof to the self-sufficiency which can afford to dispense
with the idea of cultivation, for the loftiest purposes of
speech!
But let us return, for a moment, to the actual state of
the case.
Whatever may have been the condition of
things in ancient Greece or Rome, where a universal taste
for cloquence, and the prevalent passion for distinction
and renown, may have contributed much to foster the
cultivation of oratory ; it is a fact universally admitted,
that the Anglo-Saxon constitution and temperament do
not confer a predisposition to cloquence in its external
relations. An instructive contrast presents itself in the
case of the Irish nation. That people are, — from the

noble to the peasant, — constitutionally expressive and
eloquent, in attitude, action, look, and tone. The Eng.
lishman may be galled into indignant invective, he may
be roused to forcible argument; but he is not spontane-
ously eloquent. The Scotchman may be rich in the
mental materials of eloquence, in the poetry of thought,
in the pathos of feeling, in the play of imagination; but
he is not externally expressive — quite otherwise, - he is
awkward, rather. A similar distinction obviously exists,
in the United States, between the native dignity of de-
portment, and the eloquent expression, so generally char-
acteristic of the people of the South, contrasted with the
rigid, cold, hard, dry, angular, and reserved manner, which
prevails in New England.*
The chill exterior of the Anglo-Saxon race, — although
environing a world of interior and central fire, - freezes
the stream of expressive feeling, and encrusts the surface
of character and manner. The prevalent notion in old
and in New England, alike, – that manliness demands
reserve, and dignity, stiffness, throws a morbid restraint
over the tendencies of nature to communication and ex-
pression, and prematurely quenches the capability of elo-
quence in exterior manner. Here is one reason why, with
us, the express cultivation of manner in speaking, be-
comes so important, as a compensation for the prevalence
of counteracting habit in social and domestic life. The
vivacious, the tasteful, the spirited, the graceful, ethereal
Greek might, perhaps, have dispensed with the culture of
manner in expressive utterance. Not so with the blunt,
surly, and taciturn Englishman, or with the angular,
mechanical, and constrained New Englander.
But our impediments to eloquence of manner, do not
lie in constitution and habit only; they are imbedded in
our systems of education. Our schools and colleges

equally tend to produce a false and inexpressive style of
speaking. We take a boy, at an early age, without pre-
vious moulding, and place him on the platform of the
school rostrum, to speak a set speech, a formal declama-
tion, or a political harangue, of which he knows little, and
feels less. Such is our first step in oratorical training.
Could the result be other than what it so generally is ?
Our boys early acquire an unnatural, formal, old-man-like
style of speaking, which has no heart, no truth,
ality, - no vividness, - no genuine earnestness; although,
under the exciting influence of circumstances, it may be
forced, occasionally, from the monotony of the pulpit, into
the hacking and jagged style of the bar, the turgid vehe-
mence of the popular declaimer, or the unnatural violence
of the partisan champion.
The unmeaning tone and manner, thus contracted in
early years, become, unconsciously to the individual, the
fixed habits of after life; the college declamation confirms
the style acquired at school; and the professional institu-
tion stamps, with its irrevocable seal, the manner of the
man in his maturity. Hence the rarity, among us, of the
accomplishment of a chaste, easy, and natural style of
speaking, of the power of rising gracefully and appropri-
ately with the inspiration of a subject, - of becoming
forcible, yet free from violence, -of expressing strong
emotion, without turbulence.
Cultivation of manner in speaking, is rendered highly
important, not only by circumstances which affect races
and communities of men, but by those, also, which act
upon the individual. Who is there that can say he has
been duly educated, by the silent but most effective of all
teaching, — that of perfect example, operating from child-
hood to manhood ? Who is there, of whom it can be
justly said, that he is free from every vice of organ and of
habit, in speech or action ?- The fault of misarticulating
a single letter, may effectually vitiate a speaker's habit
of enunciation; a single ungainly trick of gesture, may

render his whole manner ridiculous. Ilow often is a
gross and glaring fault the predominating characteristic of
the self-confident speaker who derides the idea of culti-
vation !
Objections to the study of elocution, however, are usu-
ally founded on erroneous views of its design and effect.
It is thought to involve artificial processes and artifical re-
sults, — to be a fabricated attempt to imitate nature, a
process of wire-pulling, by which the voice and the arms
are to be mechanically moved and displayed, by rule. No
view can be more false than this. Elocution is, indeed,
the art of managing the voice and the person, in the act
of speech. But, like every other form of genuine art, it
is only the highest and the st, the truest forms of nature
embodied in practice.
Man naturally possesses and employs all the elements
of this art. The child is, in his sphere, the perfect model
for the orator, - the living poet of expression. But the
child, as he emerges successively into the boy, the youth
the man, just as, according to the poet, he lets the
divine
ray within him fade into the common light of
day," — loses this original and admirable faculty, in the
dull routine of formal education. He unconsciously sac-
rifices nature to the lowest of all the shapes of art, that
of conventional habit, - the machinery of arbitrary form.
-
The human being, as he goes on from that beautiful
spot in his early life, where all was truth and beauty and
power, poetry and eloquence, - from the time when every
look, and tone, and action was inspired with the truest
and most expressive life, - would carry the atmosphere
-
of that scene with him, and expand in power of expres-
sion, as his intellect expanded. But the expressive powers
of the boy, are neglected, and left to wither. Our places
of education make no provision for the culture of imagina-
tion and feeling, — the main-springs of living communi-
cation.

nature, with innumerable objects which elicit expression
from the heart; and his impressible imagination assimi-
lates itself to the scene, and takes on and gives off, with
ease, and with brilliant effect, the choicest forms of elo-
quent tone, attitude, and action. But when the period of
school-life is arrived, these rich sources of influence are,
in a degree, cut off, or he is debarred from them. The
close room, the bench, and the book, take the place of the
inspiring air, the green bank, and its alphabet wf flowers.
The oxygen of life is withdrawn; the lungs play feebly;
the circulation lags; the spirit of communication is quench-
ed; the brain becomes dull and inert; the mind is im-
poverished; the heart is quelled; the fancy languishes;
the hours become irksome from the sense of weariness
and restraint. Nor does an inspiring intellectual activity
take the place of nature's incitements : the mental pro-
cesses, on the contrary, are, principally, mechanical and
insipid, a weary round of senseless reïteration of un-
meaning and unintelligible sounds, amid which the atten-
tion works with the movement of the mill-horse, in its
never ending, never changing round.
But the scene is not shifted, even when ceaseless reït-
eration has left its mark on the memory, and the arbitrary
process of spelling and syllabication, has been repeated
till the mind has become expert in the mechanical opera-
tion of reading. The little student of written language,
is then presented, perhaps, with a book of abstract sen-
tences which, to him, are unintelligible, or, at most, life-
less successions of sound uninspired by feeling; in which
imagination, — with its utmost stretch of inventive power,
can find no food, and amid which it gradually dies out.
Add to all this neglect and privation, the effect of being
drilled into the habit of duly “pausing till you can count
one,” at every comma, -of giving an emphasis on the
model of the pedantic circumflex of the schoolmaster, and
uttering the tones of emotion in the style of his stereotype
utterance; and the usual consummation is attained; the

37
power of natural, free, expressive voice, is utterly eradi-
cated; and the transplanted scion of false habit, has taken
most effectual root. The eloquent child has become a
dull and mistuned reader, and is fully prepared to become,
in his next stage of education, a lifeless and soulless
speaker.
What elocution aims at, under these circumstances, is
to restore the lost power of expression, to inspire natural
life into the voice, to strip off the incrustation of mechan-
ical habit, and leave the soul again free to utter itself in
whatever mood nature prompts to the individual. Elocu-
tion prescribes no technical uniformity of manner : it, in
the first place, hands to the student the implements of
scientific analysis, and enables him to detect the complexi-
ties of tone, and to become familiar with every element,
in all its varied aspects of combination; and, since the
date of Dr. Rush's masterly analytic exhibition of the
human voice, the requisite processes have become as
definite and as tangible as those of music. Having ac-
complished its office as a science, elocution next presents
itself as an art, and aids the student in reconstructing the
vocal fabric; inserting every element in its due place, ac-
cording to its character, with the observant eye faith-
fully fixed on nature, as the only model; but carefully
discriminating between the local, corrupted exhibitions of
nature, in mechanical habit, and the free, general working
of nature as a principle; – distinguishing the specialities
of actual usage from its broad axioms and laws.
Elocution, when true to its purposes, thus emancipates
the individual from the trammels of mere accidental habit
and corrupted custom, and sets him out on a new career
of action, in which he is guided by conscious knowledge,
by intelligent preference, by recognized truth, by reflec-
tive judgment, and deliberate will, by personal organiza-
tion, and individual character, the true sources of elo-
quence in external manner.
Our present defective systems of education, leave this

work as a task of self-cultivation, for every student who
would succeed in acquiring the power of expressive utter-
ance;
and
years
of assiduous endeavor are surely not too
high a price to pay for such an acquirement. The eradi.
cation of the false habits which neglect and misdirected
culture have accumulated, would, alone, render necessary
a long and laborious course of application. The univer-
sal tone, for example, of our academic “exhibitions,” dis-
plays false intonation and partial song, throughout. No
student gives us, on such occasions, his own personal tone,
but a certain average result of all the arbitrary effects of
voice, which he has heard others use, in similar circum-
stances. We hear, from every speaker, but a succession
of sentences, in which sound seems, so to speak, — to
have become stereotyped of old, and thence to have de-
scended, as an inheritance, to successive generations, to
be regularly assumed with the orator's academic gown.*
The false intonation thus cherished in academies and
colleges, reäppears in professional life, in the dry mechan-
ical modulation of the lawyer, the heavy and somnolent
tones of the clergyman, and the “inexplicable dumb show
and noise” of the popular declaimer.
The office of elocution is to enable the student to detect
and avoid the various forms of error in general usage, and
in the habits of the individual, to assist him in throwing
off the load of unmeaning and unnatural custom, and to
give him direct access to the hearts of others, by the true
and full expression of his own.
But even if there were no obstructions to progress, such

ties such as ours, in which public speaking is so frequently the indis-
pensable duty of individuals, an ample provision for instruction in the
art of elocution, might be justly expected to exist. But its ahsence
necessarily devolves on students individually the greater exertion, in
self-culture.

of
as those which have been described, — did every student
actually enjoy the advantage of starting on his mental
career, unembarrassed by any hinderance of habit or cir-
cumstance, - the very growth and expansion of his intel-
lectual character, would be ever making new demands
for a commensurate power of expression. A mind fur-
nished with all possible accumulations of thought,- to him
who cannot give them utterance, is but “the locked coffer,
without its key." — Every step up the steep of knowledge,
calls forth, in the rightly constituted mind, a new fountain
of emotion, a new world of association for scope to the
inventive faculty, and therefore demands a new power
utterance. Fidelity to the duty of self-cultivation, requires
of the student that he wrestle for the noblest achieve-
ments of self-mastery, in the acquisition of that power by
which his organic constitution may become the worthy
minister of his mind, and yield it a free and adequate ut-
terance to others, of whatever sheds light on his own
path, or imparts a new throb of life to his own heart. But
the obligation becomes inexpressibly enhanced, when we
transfer it to the highest subjects of thought, and the
purest movements of benevolent feeling.
It is among the ordinations of Infinite wisdom, that, of
all parts of man's organic structure, those which are em-
ployed in the functions of voice, are the most susceptible
of culture and discipline. Look at the difference between
the tune hummings of the little boy, and the wonderful
and impressive execution of the consummate vocalist.
A similar transition may be made in speech, by every hu-
man being who has sufficient force and steadfastness of
will to insure the requisite diligence in practice.
The sense of duty, applied in this direction, will work
its wonted wonders; and every day's observation fur-
nishes to the elocutionist the most striking examples of
individuals commencing a course of self-culture, under
immense disadvantages of neglected habit and false train-
ing, yet achieving, within a few months, a complete tri-

umph over all such obstacles, and becoming animated,
correct, and impressive speakers.
The claims of liberal education, on all who have en-
joyed its benefits, seem to demand the perceptible fruits
of mental culture in the student's acts of communication
with his fellow-men. Rudeness of speech is a venial
thing in the uneducated; but it is utterly unjustifiable in
those who sustain to general society the weighty respon-
sibilities which rest upon the scholar. To him who en-
joys the stores of mental wealth, Humanity says, "Be
not a niggard of thy wealth: be not a niggard of thy
speech, which may impart that wealth, without impover-
ishing thyself."
To the occupant of the pulpit, the beseeching voices of
ignorance, of suffering, of degradation, all are lifted up,
pleading for light, for sympathy, for renovation, in tones
that would seem to make man desire the possession of
angelic powers to put forth on their behalf. The offer of
aid comes, too generally, from a voice that, as far as
the music of emotion is concerned, bespeaks heartless in-
difference, listless apathy, utter inability to assist, or entire
ignorance of the facts of the case.
Aside from such considerations, however, the impor-
tance of culture and skill in address, as an indispensable
qualification for the right discharge of the public duties of
the profession, is a subject which, at present, demands
the earnest attention of students of theology. The pub-
lic voice is loud and urgent on this point: the dissatisfac-
tion with the deplorable deficiencies of manner which are
so prevalent in the pulpit, is uttered with no sparing tone.
Students, if they mingled more at large with the world,
would hear expressions on this subject, which might well
startle them. It is a general complaint, among congrega-
tions of every denomination, that the style of pulpit elo-
cution is miserably low and defective. To hear a sermon
is not unfrequently spoken of as a matter of endurance,
on the score of manner. It is not transcending the strict-

est limit of truth, on this subject, to say that society has
become impatient and clamorous in regard to it. Elocu-
tionists are well aware of the fact, that not a few religious
societies, in various denominations, request of their min-
isters to put themselves under training, with a view to
the remedy of defects of manner, which are so great as to
prove obstacles to professional usefulnes.*
The desecrating effects of the practice, so frequent in
American churches, of dismissing incumbents from their
charge, are, in very many instances, to be traced to an
uninteresting and unimpressive manner of preaching, as
their original source. Of a hundred dismissions, not one
can usually be found to have happened in the case of an
earnest and eloquent preacher. No congregation consid-
ers itself as excepting the item of qualification for the
pulpit, in their stipulations with the individual whom they
receive as their pastor; and it is a prevalent impression,
that no society can flourish under the charge of one who
is an indifferent speaker. The world assumes due prep-
aration for the duties of the pulpit, as a part of profes-
sional education. But, of all the theological institutions
in the United States, there is not, perhaps, one, which, by
adequate arrangements to that effect, enables its students
to receive the benefit of an express course of training in
the art of speaking.† The mere opportunity of declaim-
ing in turn, or some other expedient not more efficacious,
is all that is usually enjoyed by way of preparation for
one of the most important acts that man can be called to
perform in presence of his fellow-men. Theologians have
slumbered over this great question : and the result is just
what might be expected. The duties of the pulpit are,

for the most part, miserably performed; and the church
and the world have to abide the consequences.
Nor can
the fact cease to be otherwise, while it is the fixed cus-
tom, at professional institutions, to devolve on one man
the unreasonable load of labor inseparable from the double
duty of teaching students to speak, as well as to write.
But, say some, why make so much of this affair of ex-
ternal manner? Admitting that a persuasive speaker
always wins us, that an earnest one impresses us, and
that a dull one wearies us, — why go through a long
course of discipline to arrive at an earnest or a persuasive
style of speaking? Does it not all depend on earnest
feeling or affectionate interest ? Is anything more than
earnestness or warmth required, to produce this effect ?
If a man really is in earnest, he must make people feel;
it cannot be otherwise.
So argues the merchant, who, never in his life, perhaps,
wrote twenty pages of consecutive thought which he
afterwards read or spoke in a public assembly: so argues,
sometimes, the lawyer, who, in his busy life, is mingling
continually with men in practical affairs, exciting and ex-
cited by the usual stimulants to communication, inter-
est, argument, professional repute; but who seldom has
been subjected to the discipline of successive days of
seclusion, and silence, and profound meditation on a vast
theme, and then called from this life-quelling process to
the life exhausting one, of public speaking, once a week,
three times, perhaps, on the same day, -on themes
which, by their very depth and solemnity, exhaust the
cerebral and nervous systems, and, by the deep tones
which they naturally require, equally exhaust the powers

lic speaker. The seclusion and stillness of the week, and
the intensity of his daily mental action, have disqualified
him, corporeally, for the process of vigorous and impres-
sive utterance, on the broad scale of regular public ad-
dress. To him the act of professional speaking, – or still
more, that of professional reading, - is peculiarly exhaust-
-
ing. Hence he is more frequently subjected to an im-
paired state of health, than one who, like the barrister, is
less confined to the act of intense thought. To him it is
doubly important that he should know how to use his
voice skillfully, -effectively to others, and yet with ease
to himself. The sedentary form of life to which he must
ever be closely limited by the nature of his professional
preparation, exposes him, peculiarly, to fatigue and injury,
immediately consequent on the act of speaking.
To speak extemporaneously, or from premeditation,
will it is true,exempt the preacher from many of the pecu-
liarly injurious effects of this mode of professional life.
But the prevalent demand of society, for the union of two
incompatible effects in pulpit speaking, - that of a care-
fully elaborated written discourse, and that, at the same
time, – of a well-spoken address, devolves on him a
double share both of intellectual and of corporeal exer-
tion. To give his sermon the free and natural effect of
speaking, he must either lose something of the strict rhe-
torical character of his style of composition, in conse-
quence of withdrawing his eye so frequently froin his
manuscript as to lose the details of his written expres-
sion; or he must come into the pulpit, prepared by so
often repeated previous reading of his discourse, that it is
virtually impressed on his memory.
The practice of systematic elocution, is, in reference to
such circumstances, an important aid to facility and im-
pressive manner in reading, and lightens effectually the
burden of the task to be performed. Nor is such labor
light. Few persons who have not made the experiment,
can be aware of the force of impression on the mind, or

of
of the degree of action in brain and nerve, which is neces-
sary to produce impressive reading aloud, in the space
usually filled by the voice of the preacher, as contrasted
with that which is experienced in merely receiving the
ideas of an author, by the silent reading of the page of a
book. All that is necessary, in the latter case, is merely
that the thought be passively received or felt, - up to
the extent of the reader's receptive capacity; in the for-
mer, the measure of thought and emotion must not only
be full but overflowing; so that the surplus, as it were,
of
feeling, may be sufficient to carry along, in its tide, the
sympathies of a whole audience. The public reader not
only receives but imparts, and, as it were, stamps an im-
pression. This active state of sympathy is what alone
can convey a sentiment from the heart of the reader to
those of his hearers.
The practice of elocution secures the power pro-
ducing such effects easily and without fatigue. It serves,
also, to render, by this means, the exercise of public speak-
ing a salutary instead of an exhausting process. It in-
vigorates the organs, and secures them against injury.
It lightens professional labor ; it tends to prolong life and
protect health, while it secures an entire control over the
voice, and makes it a ready and obedient instrument of
the will.
The study of elocution enables the speaker to give life
and effect to every sentiment which he utters, and to send
it home to the heart. It gives him a comparatively un-
limited control over the attention and sympathies of those
whom he addresses, and secures to what he utters a deep
and permanent impression on the mind; nor is it a slight
consideration that it enables him to impart to all his ut-
terance the attractions of propriety and grace. It insures,
in a word, the whole benefit resulting from eloquence in
manner.
All that the elocutionist, as such, pleads for, is, that the
student after fifteen years, perhaps, of misdirected prac-

tice in reading, would give but the vigorous and faithful
exertions of one, to the reformation of habit, or, at least,
to the attempt at reformation. Half an hour, diligently
employed, twice a day, for a year, on the rudiments of
the art, would usually suffice for the removal of promi-
nent faults, and for the acquisition of the most important
traits of a good elocution.
The student of theology, who has yet the susceptibility
of youthful life upon him, and the leisure to cultivate his
powers, and form his manner, and who, whether from
self-sufficiency, or ignorance, or indolence, or diffidence,
deliberately prefers to neglect the consecration of his
active nature, in its highest capabilities of excellence, to
the function which he means to assume, the elocution-
ist may well despair of moving by any argument which
he can offer. The passive and lethargic pastor, who has
given himself to his people, “ for better, for worse,” and
to whom the calling, visiting, and miscellaneous jobbing
of his vocation, are sufficient excuses for neglecting its
nobler offices, is still farther removed from any influ-
ence of persuasion. But to both the teacher of elocution
may be allowed to say, Look on this picture and on
this," — the uncultivated and the cultivated speaker in the
pulpit.
The former may, by no very improbable combination
of chances, happen to exemplify all the following faults.
He may have a bad voice. The screech of his excited
tones may absolutely harrow the ear; he may have the
gruff voice of the skipper of a smuggling lugger, or a hard
guttural utterance, with tones which are little short of a
continuous assault and battery on the ear; he may
have
the soft guttural tone of a voice choaked in the throat, as
if every sound came from the gullet; he may have a
uniform nasal twang, so strong as to provoke laughter;
or he may have a thin, weak voice, with a high piping
note, which, when applied to the solemn language of
deep feeling creates a ludicrous incongruity. But how is

he to become aware of such faults ? Habit has made the
sound of his voice natural and true to his ear. Culture
alone can correct such faults.*
The preacher, who neglects the cultivation of his voice,
suffers, sometimes, to a peculiar extent, the penalties of
violated laws of organization. His vocal organs are the
instruments of his professional action and usefulness; yet
he not only omits the use of the only means of invigorat-
ing them, but employs them, perhaps, at the greatest dis-
advantage, from want of knowledge and skill in regard to
the appropriate mode of exerting them, so as to avoid
fatigue and exhaustion, and consequent loss of health.
Individuals in this predicament sink, perhaps, even in
early life, under the effects of wrong habits in the use of
the vocal organs.
The uncultivated speaker sometimes renders himself
disagreeable by his habitual violations of propriety and
taste, his obvious slovenliness of style, or want of appro-
priate education, as regards the humble and merely rudi-
mental attainment of correct pronunciation. He may
* It is much to be regretted that, in many parts of the United States,
education takes so little effect on outward manner, and that, in New
England, particularly, a round, smooth, agreeable voice, is not invaria-
bly the characteristic of mental culture and polish. The absence of
natural and acquired refinement, is unequivocally indicated in the hid-
eous tones of voice which are not unfrequently heard from the pulpit.
| It is matter of regret, that this subject is so much neglected in early
education, and that professional men, generally, do so little justice to
themselves and their language, by the numerous improprieties which
they habitually exemplify in speech. New England, more particularly,
is marked by the extensive prevalence of local faults, in this respect;
and most of these are owing to the sanction unfortunately given by Dr.
Webster to such peculiarities. An obsolete and awkward style of pro-
nunciation, has thus gained currency, even in places of learning. But
some of Dr. Webster's modes are nearly a century out of date, for the
present day; and not a few are absolute Scotticisms, and errors of
dialect, peculiar to Yorkshire or to New England.
This defect in Dr. Webster's dictionary, was much to be regretted, as
the fulness and accuracy of its definitions, render it otherwise so valua-

even fail in respect of a distinct articulation of syllables
and sounds, so far as to obscure the sense of whatever he
utters, or even to render him unintelligible. But of these
evils he is unaware; he has not been accustomed to
watch his own habits; he is, in this particular, the help-
less victim of circumstances, which have moulded him,
unconsciously to himself, into the grossest errors. An
hour's practice with an elocutionist, would put it in his
power to correct these faults in a few weeks, and to sub-
stitute for his errors a chaste and correct manner of pro-
nouncing, and for his hurried and confused utterance an
accurate, clear, distinct enunciation.
The undisciplined speaker frequently exhibits a dis-
pleasing loudness or violence of voice, or, on the other hand,
a faint and feeble utterance, which does not allow him to
be heard. He may have a uniform bawling or calling
force, which indicates no variation of feeling, no softening
touch of subdued emotion; or he may have nothing of
that force which imparts manly energy to expression, and
gives impulse to the heart. He may have, perhaps, that
,
uniform medium of voice, which never swells or subsides
with feeling, and which renders his style utterly inexpres-
sive and uninteresting. He has never studied the work-
ing of nature in vocal habit, or watched the ebb and flow
of utterance, as the tide of emotion gushes forth, or sub-
sides, in the voice. The rising and the lulling of the
wind, seem to have taught his ear no lesson. But to all
such effects cultivation would have opened his ear and
his heart, and imparted their power to his utterance.
The skilful emphasis of a good reader, which gives to
the main points of his expression a sculptured promi-
nence, and striking force of effect, the unpractised speaker
has never observed. He gives little or no emphasis, at
all; or, on the other hand, he multiplies and crowds his
ble. It is gratifying, therefore, to observe, that the Rev. Prof. Good-
rich, in his revised edition of the work, has judiciously retrenched many
instances of local usage, which were sanctioned in the first edition.

curring force, defeats its object, and destroys itself.
is thus compelled to give a double and exaggerated effect
to all his actual emphasis, which makes him seem to be
addressing an audience whose faculties were too obtuse,
otherwise, to apprehend his meaning. He may even go
so far with this habit of exaggeration as to make all his
distinctions become epigrams in sound, and his significant
expressions each one a pun, by its overcharged tone and
tortuous circumflex.* But his ear has never been opened
to the discriminations of kind and degree, in emphasis :
he has never brought his organs under the influence of
discipline, on such points: his attention, in fact, has never
been turned to them. No wonder, then, that his empha-
sis should be so often exaggerated and disproportioned ;
or that his emphatic words should sometimes be thrown
out with a jerk that would seem to intimate a sudden
flash of impatience or ill-temper, rather than a decisive
act of judgment. Culture, however, would teach such a
speaker to chasten his force by due regard to moderation
and dignity of manner, and to directness and simplicity
of expression.
The uncultivated speaker seems, usually, either to have
no power of inflecting his voice, so that, in reading, his sen-
tences run on with the flat sameness of the style of an
advertisment or a law-paper; or, on the other hand, he
twitches and jerks his words with perpetual double slides
and circumflexes,ť so that his language seems to become
a succession of verbal distinctions, quirks, or quibbles,

called “ Yankee stories ;" yet the prevalence of local habit causes it to

instead of important and impressive facts, in their appro-
priate tone. This fault is sufficiently ridiculous to ears
not indurated to it, by the effect of custom. But the
speaker who makes it, has never dreamed of its existence
in his personal habits; and he goes on, from year to year,
announcing sacred truths in the tone and accent of a
series of sly jokes. The effect of such utterance, when
added to the proverbial coldness and stiffness of general
manner, current, more particularly, in the pulpits of New
England, is one great cause of the avowed dislike, so
generally expressed in other parts of the country, to the
style of preachers from that quarter. A slight attention
to culture would suffice to put an end to such impedi-
ments to the legitimate influence of the pulpit.
The undisciplined speaker fails, usually, in adequate
length of pauses. He allows no opportunity for an im-
pressive thought to “sink down into the ear,” and pene.
trate the heart; he hastens on, heedlessly, over the most
momentous thoughts, as if they were matters of indiffer-
ence; and the effects which he produces on his hearers,
are correspondent to his style. Truth, uttered in such
modes, is stripped of its reality, and leaves the soul callous
to its power. A false current notion, that the elocution
of the pulpit is to be modelled on that of the bar, or the
popular assembly, induces some speakers to imagine that
eloquence consists in fluency, and that the acceptable
preacher is he who does not keep his people waiting for
his words, but glides on, on the "festina lente” principle,
and judiciously shortens the duration of the penance of
listening to a sermon. A moderate attention to the de-
mands of solemnity and impressiveness, as prominent fea-
tures of sacred eloquence, would guard the preacher from
such errors of judgment and taste, while it would equally
save him and his hearers from the lagging slowness and
merciless drawling, which are also among the current
faults of pulpit elocution.
The preacher who neglects the cultivation of his voice,

no
may be congratulating himself on his exemption from hol-
low and artificial tones, which he detects in others. But
he is, perhaps, in the habit of using a high, thin, and
squeaking pitch, which forbids the possibility of grave,
deep, or solemn emotion, on the part of his hearers ;
matter how reverential the unuttered feeling which is, all
the while, latent in the bosom of the speaker.
An inevitable law of our constitution demands deep
tones in the utterance of solemn emotions. The fireside
tone is intolerable in the pulpit; the voice of familiar
anecdote, substituted for that of grave and devout dis-
course, is a desecration to the ear. Yet a few hours'
practice would enable most speakers to draw and observe
the line which separates one pitch of voice and one mode
of feeling from another. The preacher would thus obey,
and coöperate with, the ordinations of Creative wisdom,
and convert his voice from a hinderance into an effective
aid to the purposes of his office.
But the undisciplined speaker in the pulpit, sometimes,
- whether from inadvertence or erroneous impression,
allows himself to fall into the opposite fault of a hollow,
sepulchral, morbid voice, which is a mere matter of habit,
and bears no relation to his theme, for the moment. He
may actually be expatiating on the joys of heaven, with
a voice which has precisely the pitch of the ghost in
Hamlet, when describing the horrors of hell. The effect
.
of such intonation usually is to make the ministrations of
the pulpit associate themselves, in the feelings of an au-
dience, with a condition of gloom and repugnance. Were
the themes of pulpit eloquence such as never admitted
strains of animation, cheerfulness, and delight, — were
love and joy necessarily debarred from the circle of sacred
emotions, - the uniformly hollow, heavy voice of awe
and horror, might be appropriate, as a characteristic of
professional elocution. But on no other condition can it
be so. Yet how often is this burden of preternatural pitch

laid upon the sensibility of an audience, by the unculti-
vated voice of the preacher !
Fitness and beauty are the universal characteristics oº
organization, in all the works of God. The very analo-
gies of man's constitution, predispose him to repeat these
traits in all his humbler sphere of creation and effect. His
nature thirsts for these, in every act of mind or body.
But if false taste and erroneous habit usurp the control
of the forming processes of education, the natural tenden-
cies of mind are checked ; the soul becomes callous; the
eye becomes blind, and the ear deaf to propriety and
grace. Perversion and evil, in every variety of shape, are
the result. The mind ceases to perceive, the organs cease
to execute their original purpose. Deformity is adopted
as the model of grace; habit imbibes the influence, and
breathes the air, which custom has prescribed. Vitiated
habit and depraved taste go hand in hand, in the work of
desecration and corruption.
The current style of elocution, in the pulpit, forms a
striking example of this downward tendency of mind and
The beautiful and wondrous adaptation of the
human voice to the varied functions of expressive utter-
ance, is clearly exhibited in the vivid and eloquent tones
of childhood. It forms a most exquisite page in the
poetry of man's life. But neglect and perversion: com-
mence, - as formerly mentioned,
- with the processes of
artificial culture ; and power and grace of expressive tone
gradually die out; so that the man, in his maturity, has
lost the faculty of adapting voice to feeling, which he
possessed in his earliest years. Not only so: he has ac-
quired mechanical and false habits of tone, which bury
rather than give forth emotion. Of a hundred persons
whom you may ask to read a vivid passage from the most
natural of all writers, Shakspeare, not one, perhaps, can
give the genuine tones of feeling to what he attempts to
read. To do such a thing, is in fact, commonly thought
to be the exercise of an art possessed only by an actor or
manner.

an elocutionist, – one who has made an express business
of acquiring the vivid tones of emotion.
The same experiment of reading may be made with
the Bible, or the hymn book, or with a page of a sermon;
and the result will, for the most part, be, that neither lay:
man nor clergyman utters any tone of feeling with its
true and appropriate character. The agonies and the
ecstasies of the Psalmist, will, usually, be read with the
tones of perfect decorum in a modern gentleman; the
seraphic ardor of Watts will be uttered with the coolest
composure; and the sermon will be read as if the ideas
of God, of heaven, and of hell, were things to which the
human heart had acquired a comfortable indifference.
The uncultivated reader in the pulpit, thus nullifies, to
the ear, whatever may be in his heart; and what was
meant to pierce the inmost soul, “ plays harmless round
the head.” The voice of the preacher, which ought to be
the living link of connection between earth and Heaven,
becomes a most effectual non-conductor. The immense
power which lies wrapped up in the human voice, and
which is only transcended by that of the soul itself, the
negligent speaker has left dormant, till he has lost faith
in its existence, and actually regards the endeavor to
arouse it as on a par with the infatuated search for imag.
inary lost treasure.
Never, from his lips, shall come the startling or the
thrilling note of warning to the slumbering spirit; the
tone that makes a Felix tremble at the fearful possibili-
ties of retribution; the voice that can melt the obdurate
heart to tears of contrition; the words that can inspire the
despondent or soothe the sorrowing soul, or “stir the blood
like the sound of a trumpet,” while it summons to “glory,
honor, and immortality.”
To the uncultivated speaker, the natural avenues of
the heart, the modes of sympathetic tone, are, compara-
tively, shut. His feelings may be strong and deep; but
he knows not how to give them effective utterance. He

is powerless from want of practice. His voice, the ap-
pointed organ of communication with the soul, has be-
come virtually dead. It might have been an instrument
of electric. effect, but he has chosen to let it rust unused.
His voice, however, is but what the hand of Angelo
would have been, undisciplined, uninspired by his soul,
a mass of bone, flesh, ligament, and skin, as that of
the laborer in the quarry, - not that wondrous instru-
ment, which more than any other production of Divine
skill, has shown how “fearfully and wonderfully” the
members of the human frame are formed, in adaptation
to the purposes and capacities of the soul.
The preacher who neglects the cultivation of his or-
gans, usually subjects himself to a whole host of disad-
vantages, distinct from those which are connected with
the unskilful use of the voice. He offends the eye, by
violating the natural laws of posture and motion, which reg-
ulate the human frame.
Man's body was designed to depict his emotions, by its
sympathetic coöperation with his mind. But the preacher
has listened to the prevailing cant around him, about at-
titude and gesticulation, and has neglected the natural
use of his bodily members, as expressive agents; so that
he has lost the power of using them, and even a natural,
momentary exertion of using them, has become, to him, a
conscious effort. In the unperverted years of childhood,
his soul beamed forth in every posture, and in every ac-
tion; his very frame radiated emotion, and invested itself
with the powers of a spiritual presence. Such is man's
natural condition. But education steps in, and imposes
on his body the same train of evils which it inflicted on
his voice. It quenches the light, and steals away the
warmth of his being, and moulds his susceptible nature
into low and arbitrary forms, either inevitable or actually
prescribed. The informing spirit withdraws itself from
its original resort to the exterior frame, and ceases to ac-
tuate it: the bodily organs are soon usurped by routine

and mechanism: constraint, coldness, rigidity, reserve,
embarrassment, and awkwardness, take the place of free-
dom, warmth and life; a hard, dry, narrow, angular, me-
chanical gesticulation displaces the natural, free, flowing
action which sprung directly from feeling. Artificial cul-
tivation confirms all these faults into habits; judgment
ceases to recognize the true and reject the false ; taste
becomes assimilated to style, and learns to love the arbi-
trary and the unnatural.
The professional speaker carries into the sphere of the
pulpit, the faults which mis-directed education has made
a part of himself; and unless he is willing then to assume
the labor of reform and renovation, he cannot produce, in
his person and action, any just effect of expression. All
his traits of manner must be conventional, and, for every
purpose of eloquence, untrue, and ineffectual or injurious.
A few weeks of assiduous culture, however, would re-
move the impediments which artificial habit has thus
accumulated, and convert the awkward, ungainly, and
disagreeable manner into one of genuine nature, propriety,
freedom, force, and grace.*
Our sketch of the usual faults of the uncultivated
speaker, has been so extended into detail, that little room
remains, - in consistency with the necessary limits of this
volume, — to describe the cultivated. He may be pic-
tured, however, in imagination, as the reverse of the
former, in every point. The few individuals who, as yet,
have devoted their attention to the inevitable effects of
manner in the pulpit, are easily distinguished: they speak
with freedom, with earnestness and fervor, with impres-
sive power, with manly force, with chaste propriety, with
* The Rev. Edward Irving was an impressive example of the effect
of cultivation in personal manner and action. In his early professional
efforts in Scotland, he exhibited a style the most awkward, constrained,
and unnatural, that, perhaps, the pulpit ever exhibited. At a subse-
quent period, in London, his attitude and action became, by assiduous
culture, most strikingly eloquent in their effect.

attractive grace. There is a living reality, a glowing life,
in their utterance, a genuine refinement, a persuasive elo.
quence of manner, which rivet theattention, and command
the whole mind and heart. They excel the preacher who
is merely an eloquent writer or composer of sermons, üs
much as the orator does the essayist. Intellectual force,
aided by scholarship and taste, will ensure all the merits
of the latter. But assiduous self-culture, and resolute
practice, in special and appropriate forms, are indispensa-
ble to him who would secure the power of the former ;
and while the young preacher may well be excused from
the usurping demands on time and labor, indispensable to
the attainments of a consummate orator, no unreasonable
amount of exertion is required to make him an effective
and successful speaker, or, in other words, to enable him
to accomplish all the true objects of oratory, by uttering
his thoughts earnestly, appropriately, and persuasively.

Regarded, however, as an act which is the result of
will, it always implies life, spiritual and animal. Death
seals, irrevocably, the lips of man; despair, despondency,
dejection, disease, exhaustion, languor, may close them
for a time. But the natural renovation of life, by joy or
by repose, revives the law of sympathy and communica-
tion : animation prompts to speech and action. So uni-
forin is this effect, that silence and reserve, in man, are
recognized as the indications of illness, displeasure, de-
pression, gloom, or dissatisfaction. The taciturn individ-
ual, in society, seems morose, dispirited, or timid.
It is a law of expression, therefore, in accordance with
these facts, that life and animation are conditions of
speech, both as regards the language of audible utterance,
and that which exists, to the eye, in the attitudes and
actions of the body. Conversation, destitute of the in-
spiring effect of animation, becomes dull and tedious
while the spirited interchange of thought is one of the
purest sources of mental and social pleasure, and, at the
same time, one of the most powerful springs of intellec-
tual action and development.
So it is in regard to the premeditated and formal com-
munications of public address. Deprive these of life, on
their wonted occasions, - and the prosing technicalities
of the pleader seem but a heavy burlesque on the vaunted
connection between law, eloquence, and justice; the
“popular” orator, when dull, immediately becomes un-
popular, - or, in the language of Dogberry, "most tolera-
ble, and not to be endured.” Can the preacher who
drones and drawls, and stands mionless and lifeless in
the pulpit, reasonably hope to be exempt from the influ-
ence of the law of association which identifies dullness
with stupidity ?
In vain does he plead the solemnity of his themes, the
gravity of his profession, and the depth of tone, and the
sedateness of manner which belong to these. Profound
emotion and decorous action are not dullness : they are a

.
genuine part of living eloquence on great subjects; they
are the very opposite of drawling, lagging, monotonous
utterance, unemphatic expression, and lifeless, automa-
ton-like gestures
Want of life and animation in the preacher, extends
itself, necessarily, to the congregation. Nothing is so
Mesmeric in its influence as dullness. The lifeless sopo-
rific tone, like the droning hum of the bee, lulls the sense
and the soul, alike, to slumber. The torpor of the preacher
diffuses itself over his audience; and his own somnolent
manner is soon reflected to him, in the “lack-lustre eyes”
of those of the congregation, who, in such circumstances,
can any longer be called hearers.
The chief source of dullness in the pulpit, is, no doubt,
that want of tact in the handling of a subject, which
makes the great themes of religion commonplace to the
preacher himself, and therefore to his audience. Educa-
tion, it must be acknowledged, does little to empower the
preacher to breathe fresh life into old themes. The theo-
logian enters upon his office, but little disciplined in that
free, natural, original, and inspiring use of his faculties,
which enables the poet to find ever new life and beauty
in every component atom of the creation, and to expati-
ate, with an eloquence which we feel to be divine, on the
common light and air of heaven, or the most ordinary
plant by the wayside. The preacher seems, too often, to
be consciously handling trite themes, to which it is a
hopeless attempt to endeavor to impart life and interest.
He speaks, accordingly, as if the utmost reach of his am-
bition were to invest dullness with a tolerable decency,
und to get through the routine of his function, in the best
wa; le can.
TH?; wer cf taking interesting, impressive, and strik-
ing vies of common things, implies, unquestionably, a

this important acquirement remains, as at present, one of
the unattempted prizes of diligence, it is certain that the

obvious and palpable advantages of even a partial culti-
vation, are entirely overlooked, as respects the express
training of preachers for the public duties of their office.
It surely is not absolutely necessary that, to want of
original power, and to want of due intellectual discipline,
in the occupants of the pulpit, there should invariably be
added an utter want of skill in expression, as regards the
use of the voice, and the appropriate accompaniments of
action.
The dull and lifeless speaker may become animated, if
he will resolutely set about accomplishing the task. The
training prescribed in the practice of elocution, will pre-
sent him with subjects of exercise, drawn from the most
inspiriting passages of the most powerful writers. It will
accustom him to glow over inspiring themes. It will
show him the natural modes of uttering and imparting
vivid emotions. It will train his organs to lively exertion.
It will invigorate his tones, enhance his emphasis, sharpen
his inflections, enliven his accents, breathe life into his
whole expression, mould his frame into pliancy and elo-
quent effect, impel his arm, kindle his eye, flush his cheek
with genuine emotion, and light up his whole manner
with a feeling which radiates from within. All
thus eloquent in childhood : all who have the force of
resolution and the persevering diligence requsite for the
endeavor, may recover “ the buried talent.”
The style of the pulpit, while it requires, in common
with all modes of expression, the due animation of a liv-
ing effect, forbids, of course, that mere animal vivacity
which is incompatible with dignity and sobriety of man-
ner, and borders on puerility, by incessant motion and
gesticulation, a talkative style of utterance, with high
pitch, unreserved loudness, rapid enunciation, half-mi-
metic tones, abrupt and startling variations, grotesque
expression, and dramatic attempts at humor.
Original and eccentric characters, such as Rowland Hill
and John Campbell, can be tolerated, and even occasion-
men are

ally relished for their native buoyancy of spirits: their
exuberance of action and expression, even when it vio-
lates decorum, is pardoned, in consideration of the striking
effect which, for the moment, it imparts to a thought usu-
ally uttered and received in a languid and passive mood.
But mere animal spirits, in a speaker, without the depth
and original force of such men, serve only to discompose
and annoy the mind of the hearer who desires grave and
impressive instruction on momentous subjects.
To acquire expressive power of voice and manner, the
process is the same which the judicious artist adopts.
Study nature deeply and intensely, till you imbibe its
beauty, its freshness, and its power: devote ample time
to the cultivation of a relish for genuine art, in all its
varied forms; - for all the fine arts are but modifications
of the one great art of expression. Above all, imbue your
mind with the spirit of poetry, by the habitual studious
reading of the works of the master spirits of our vernacu-
lar literature. Study, especially, the dramatists, – read
them diligently aloud, with full force of feeling, -as a
matter of professional culture and self-training; and the
ear will inevitably open to the impressions of living emo-
tion in tone and action; every expressive trait in your
own mental character will thus be quickened, and the
power of penetrating the heart and swaying the sympa-
thies of others, be acquired, – to an indefinite extent.
Could the young preacher be but induced to bestow a
tithe of the labor which is bestowed by the young player,
on the acquisition of a vivid and expressive manner, in
word and act, every pulpit might become comparatively
a station for transmitting and diffusing the electric influ-
ence of a speaker inspired, - soul and body,- by divine
truth.

he
The mere vividness of an emotion may lead to ani-
mated expression, in countenance, voice, and action.
Such a result may be unconscious and even uninten-
tional, as is evinced in the natural communications of
childhood.
But of the deliberate and voluntary speaker, who has
a definite aim in utterance, we expect more than mere
vivacity. The orator, — and such, for the time, is the
minister in the pulpit, — has a grave purpose to accom-
plish, a specific end in view, toward which his own
mind is impelled, and toward which he wishes to conduct
the minds of his hearers. He has within him a deep-felt
emotion, which he wishes to impart to the hearts of
others. He is earnestly desirous to impress the pervad-
ing sentiment of his own soul on the sympathies of his
audience. He calls imagination to his aid, to give form
to his idea and figure to his language. He reasons,
argues, he persuades, he awes, he impels, he entreats, he
warns, he threatens, he exhorts, he melts, he terrifies, he
arouses, he subdues, he wins. His success is the reward
of his earnest desire to compass his object, His triumph
has been achieved, undoubtedly, by intellectual force ap-
propriately directed, - but through what means ? His
glowing and irresistible eloquence was not a mere affair
of the brain and the pen. These instruments have done
their work well. But what would have been their effect
without the aid of the living tongue and the expressive
action ? What gave the thoughts of the speaker an en-
trance to the heart, was not merely their intellectual life
and power, or their ideal beauty, but the earnestness of
his tone, look, and gesture.
The diffidence or the lethargic indifference of some
preachers, cuts them off from all such effects. They may
feel what they say; but they speak as though they felt

it not. The earnest pleader might justly seem to say of
them, in the expressive words of the great dramatist,
“ Their words come from their lips, ours from our
breast.” Their own souls are not apparently aroused by
what they utter; and how can it be expected that they
should awaken others? If the preacher's tone is, in such
cases, any index to his heart, he is indifferent as to the
result. It may be, indeed, that he is one of those who
disapprove of much emotion in the pulpit, and that he is
an advocate of calm dignity, and manly reserve of man-
His stoic exterior is not to be disturbed by vehe-
mence or excitement; and the slumbering soul is there-
fore to be left to its fatal lethargy.
But the fault of apparent apathy in the preacher, is
more frequently owing to the absence of expressive facil-
ity. It sometimes, indeed, is caused by a depth of inward
feeling which in vain struggles for utterance through un-
disciplined and unpractised organs. The suppressed and
choking voice sometimes, in these circumstances, dis-
closes, to the attentive ear, the true nature of the hinder-
But, from whatever source it springs, the fault of
inexpressive utterance belies the truths which fall from
the lips, and which should pierce the heart with the thrill
of intense emotion.
Earnestness is the natural language of sincerity ; it is
the condition of persuasion. It is the security for the
orator's success,
most of all, in the case of him who is
not contending for palpable rights and outward interests,
but who is pleading the most momentous of all causes,
that which is ever pending between the soul and God.
Earnestness is the most prominent trait of eloquence.
It is a thing not to be mistaken. It depends not on sci-
It is a direct product of the soul. It has no half-
way existence. Either it is not, or it comes“ beaming

without it, becomes hollow formality; gravity, coldness;
dignity, reserve: all expression loses life and power.
Yet earnestness is•external in its character, and may
be counterfeited, even, by assuming certain outward signs
of tone and action. It needs but a little attention and
reflection to note and discriminate its traits. Every ob-
server perceives its characteristic glance of the eye; its
energetic, warm, breathing, heart-issuing voice, its pithy
emphasis, its acute and keen inflection, its vivid intona-
tion, its animated movement; its forcible and spirited and
varying action, its speaking attitude and posture ; its elo-
quent glow of pervading inspiration. We see it mani-
fested in all its power as the instinctive art of eloquence
which nature teaches to the child, to the mother, to the
loving youth, to the unconscious savage.
Earnestness, as a habit in expression, is one of those
traits which education tends to quell rather than to aid.
Early, in the conventional forms of school life, it gives
way to reserve and morbid apathy, or to an arbitrary de-
Inexpressive modes of action and utterance be-
come, thus, inseparable from the prevalent habits of the
student and the professional man. Resolute self-culture
alone can replace the lost power in individuals. He who
would recover it effectually, must watch narrowly the
sources of influence on mind and character. He must
frequent those mental resorts whence he may derive en-
ergetic and stirring impulses : he must learn to detect,
and apply to his own being, the elements of inward life
and force, to see the deep and living reality within all
external forms. He must learn to deal with thoughts
rather than words, and with things more than with mere
thought. He who inhales the inner air of truth and real-
ity, cannot be an indifferent spectator of life, or an in-
different pleader for its duties. The words and tones and
looks and actions of the human being, are profound and
instructive realities to him. He cannot be indifferent to

their power : he will study them thoroughly; he will use
them effectively.
One efficacious means of infusing an earnest spirit into
expression, is the attentive study of the great models of
eloquence, ancient and modern. It is true, that the pro-
.
cess of verbal translation, and the routine of formal dec-
lamation, in academic exercises, have extracted much of
the freshness and the life of eloquence from the best
pages of classic oratory, by blunting the student's sensi-
bility to their peculiar power and beauty. But to every
true scholar there comes a time when the trammels of
early association are laid aside with the other transient
impressions of boyhood, and the man, in the maturity of
his mind, perceives and appreciates the living force of the
great masters in oratory; and then Demosthenes and
Cicero and Chatham are, to his view, themselves again,
in their original power and splendor.
The daily practice of reading aloud, and declaiming
from these authors, cannot but rouse and impel a mind
that truly feels their power. The sympathetic spirit must
catch something of their glowing earnestness and breath-
ing life of utterance. Language such as theirs it is hardly
possible for the man to repeat in the cold flat tones of the
school-boy's compulsory task.
The same may be said in regard to the effect produced
on elocution by the reading and study of all writers whose
language breathes an earnest spirit. The stirring narra-
tives, even of the novelist, — if we take such as Scott for
our illustration, - exert a similar power in awakening and
- a
impelling the feelings of the reader; and could the cler-
gyman who pleads his incessant occupation, as an apol-
ogy for neglecting the cultivation of his delivery, be in-
duced to devote but half an hour a day to the practice of
reading aloud, to his own family circle, an effective pas-
sage from such a writer, he would unavoidably acquire a
vivid and earnest manner of expression, as a habit, in
whatever possessed an interest to his own feelings.

The superficial impression that the habit of reading and
speaking, as an affair of practice, tends to make a speaker
mechanical in his style, arises from a false conception of
the nature of the exercise. The practice which the elo-
cutionist suggests is not a soulless repetition of sounds : he
insists upon it that no practice is of any avail that does
not carry the heart with it, or that does not bring forth
sincere and earnest feeling, in tone and manner. His
desire is to aid the speaker in evoking and expressing his
inmost soul, as the only condition of the power to elicit
the genuine sympathy of others. The elocutionist who
understands his subject, can never be satisfied with a
heartless, artificial style : his knowledge of his subject
must prevent him from mistaking or prescribing the false
for the true. His
very office is to break up routine, for-
mality, and every other trait of factitious habit.
The erroneous notion that practice and culture tend to
cherish an artificial manner of expression, is owing, like
many other mistakes on this subject, to our defective
modes of education. The child, at school, is permitted to
read sentences as merely so many words : the meaning
and the spirit of a passage are not invariably associated,
as they should be, with the language. The boy, the
youth, and the man, accordingly, through the successive
stages of education, regard reading as an arbitrary and
mechanical process; and the petty instruction usually
given about pausing and emphasis and the inflections of
the voice, has only served to verify and confirm the im-
pression. An education true to sentiment, to language,
and to man, would render it unnatural to the ear and the
voice to put asunder what God has joined, - the feeling
in the heart, and its utterance in appropriate tone. Ear
and voice, if trained in harmony, would always come to
one result; and the practice of reading and of speaking,
would confirm, not interfere with, the tendency of nature.
The student, therefore, should see that the whole mat-
ter rests with himself. His endeavor ought to be to re-
6*

form and renovate his habits of expression, so thoroughly
that his utterance shall always be true and earnest, and
that he shall be incapable of executing a tone or a gesture
which is not the natural and genuine result of feeling.
His daily practice should have this end uniformly in view.
The effects resulting from deficiencies and errors in for-
mal education, will thus be obviated; and every exercise
which he performs will be an additional security that his
manner shall not be mechanical, but on the contrary, liv-
ing and earnest.
One of the most valuable, in fact, of all accomplish-
ments resulting from diligent self-culture in elocution, is
the power which it imparts of entering, at once, with en-
tire and perfect sympathy, into the mood of any senti-
ment which is to be read or spoken. The homely adage,
that practice makes perfect, is in nothing more true than
in this particular case. Nor can there be a greater mis-
take than that which most persons fall into, as regards
the function of the elocutionist. The accomplished reader
is thought to possess a certain talent of assimilation, by
which he assumes, or puts on the utterance of a senti.
ment, as if it were real. The true elocutionist, like any
other sincere and earnest man, “ knows not seems ;” he
either possesses by nature, or has acquired by diligence,
a facility of giving up his whole being, — feeling and im-
agination, as well as understanding, - to the sentiment
which he expresses. To him all is intense reality. In
the act of reading impressively a strain of poetry, he is
but exerting that receptive and expressive power which
makes all things real and fresh to himself, and conse-
quently to others, a power
which dwells in the soul and
on the tongue of every child, a power which the good
reader has not lost or has only recovered. He is but per-
forming simply and earnestly one of the truest functions
of his being
The indispensable faculty of imparting reality to thought
and feeling, is, in the elocutionist, as in all other men, that,

67
rather, of perceiving and feeling the reality of thought.
He is thus enabled to impart that reality to the minds of
others. But, without this condition, there can be no true
use of the voice. Earnestness and eloquence, impres-
siveness and power, in speaking, are merely the visible
and audible effects of the inspiration which emanates
from this source.
The preacher, if he is more dependent than other
speakers, on such influence as this, is also more largely
furnished with its aid : his themes are the most inspiring
and the most impressive on which the human mind can
dwell. To be eloquent, he has but to be earnest. Earn-
estness of heart, however, does not necessarily imply
earnestness of manner. The very depth and vividness
of feeling, are sometimes the actual causes of silence.
The preacher has to learn, like other speakers, to control
and modify his emotions so that they may become capa-
ble of expression. He must learn to recognize the natural
signs of earnest emotion in tone and action, and to iden-
tify these with his whole manner. He must learn to lay
aside the passive habits into which he may have fallen
in the silence and seclusion of his study, and enter upon
the active efforts of living expression and effective com-
munication with society. He must, if he would attain
success, labor to acquire the power of imparting to others
the reality which his thoughts possess to his own mind.
The earnestness of his manner in speaking, is the natural
gauge of this reality. The preacher, therefore, who feels
the importance of this point, will not think it unworthy
of his office to study and observe every effective means
of imparting earnestness to his voice or his action. How
often is the hearer left aware how much more the preach-
er might effect, were his tone more expressive, his em-
phasis stronger, his manner more energetic; were he but
earnest enough to secure interest in his thoughts, and
sympathy with his feelings !
The quiet and placid tenor of a pastor's life, while it

favors his attainments in the contemplation of abstract
and reflective truth, is not so conducive to the acquisition
of the power of earnest and impressive utterance. He,
as a speaker, needs, more than others, the aid of express
study and practice in that art which tends to impart“ ac-
tion and utterance, and the power of speech to stir men's
blood,” for great purposes. The player who is faithful
to the duties of his vocation, gives the daily study of suc-
cessive years, to the preparation for performing a great
part, so as to give effective utterance to great sentiments
and glowing language. He whose express business it
has been to render himself expert in giving to thought
and emotion their appropriate tone, look, attitude, and
action, with all the earnestness of life, feels that this very
process is one in which careful study and laborious prac.
tice are perpetually required to ensure success. The
daily arduous study practised by such men as Kemble
and Macready, might well put to the blush many a phleg-
matic speaker in the pulpit, who seldom passes a thought
on the only natural means of rendering his ministrations
interesting or impressive.
No juster remark was ever made than that contained
in the answer of the player to the preacher.
“ We utter
fiction as if it were truth; you utter truth as if it were
fiction.” Nor will this observation cease to be applicable
to the style of the pulpit, while a formal and ceremonious,
instead of a living and earnest manner, continues to be
associated with it, as a matter of habit, in preachers and
hearers. No error is more general, and none is more fatal
in its consequences, than that into which young preachers
are so apt to fall, — that the elocution of the pulpit is a
permanent fixture on which the personal habit of an indi-
vidual is to make no encroachment, and that, once in the
pulpit, a speaker is necessarily tied down to a certain
decorous average of manner, never too earnest to disturb
the
repose
of established routine.

FORCE, FEEBLENESS.
69
FORCE, FEEBLENESS.
Force, as a trait of manner in speaking, is inseparable
from earnestness. It is a natural attendant on animation.
It is the invariable characteristic of the speaker who is
himself awake to his subject, and whose feelings are in-
terested in what he utters. We hear it in the vigor of
his voice, in the weight of his emphasis, in the strength
and fullness and impressive power of his tones of emo-
tion; we see it in the manly energy of his action.
The property of force is not, it is true, an invariable
characteristic of eloquence. There are subjects and occa-
sions which quell and subdue force, and which forbid
mere loudness of voice, or energy of action. But the
public speaker who does not, on appropriate occasions,
rise to impressive force of manner, falls short, not merely
of eloquent effect, but of true and manly expression,
Freedom, appropriateness, grace, are all inferior to this
master quality. An energetic speaker will force his way
to the heart, in spite of awkward and ungainly habits.
Genuine force is, to sympathy, what necessity is to mo-
tive; it sweeps all before it.*
Force is the prime attribute of man ; it cannot be dis-
pensed with, in the habits of the speaker. No degree of
fluency, or of mere grace, can be accepted in its stead.
The feeble, florid rhetorican never affects his audience
beyond the surface of fancy. The preacher whose man-
ner is weak, never penetrates the heart, or impresses the
mind. The prime characteristic of style in man address-
* The eloquence of the Scottish preacher Chalmers, forms a striking
example in point. The uncouthness of his broad dialectic accent, and
his preternatural vehemence of voice and action, were lost in the fervid
force of that native enthusiasm with which he threw soul and body into
his subject and his manner. His whole being was concentrated on his
theme; and he held his audience, of whatever class, with the grasp of a
giant.

ing man, on topics of vast concern, must be force. Cul.
ture may come in, to modulate that force into fitting and
graceful forms. But where life and soul are, there must
be force. Eloquence persuades; but it also impels and
urges, with irresistible power.
VEHEMENCE, VIOLENCE.
Genuine force of manner in speaking, rises, indeed, on
some occasions to vehemence itself. The inspiration of
a strong emotion does not stop to weigh manner in “the
hair-balance of propriety;” it will not wait for nice and
scrupulous adaptation. The speaker who is never moved
beyond a certain decorous reserve, will never move his
audience to sympathy. Force will not be hedged in by
arbitrary prescriptions.
It is not less true, however, that vehemence, being the
offspring of enthusiasm, is, like its parent, exceedingly
prone to the evils of excess. There is a bad as well as a
good enthusiasm, and, consequently, a bad as well as a
good vehemence. The genuine inspiration, the true ve-
hemence, is, even in its strongest expression, like the
eloquence which the great orator has so characteristically
described as resembling “ the outbreaking of the fountain
from the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fire ;" it
has the force, but, still, the beauty or the grandeur, of
nature.
The vehemence of indignation is, sometimes, one of
the strongest incitements of eloquence. We trace this
fact, in many instances, in the language of the sacred
volume, not less distinctly than in that of Demosthenes,
or Cicero, or Chatham. But true vehemence never de-
generates into violence and vociferation. It is the force
uf inspiration, - not of frenzy. . It is not manifested in

71
the screaming and foaming, the stamping and the contor-
tions, of vulgar excess. It is ever manly and noble, in
its intensest excitement : it elevates, it does not de-
grade.
It never descends to the bawling voice, the gut-
tural coarseness, the shrieking emphasis, the hysteric
ecstasy of tone, the bullying attitude, and the clinched fist
of extravagant passion.
GENTLENESS, SPIRIT, TAMENESS.
The excesses of improper vehemence in delivery, how-
ever, while they are utterly revolting to humanity and
taste, are no excuse for the habitual weakness of manner,
which is betrayed by speakers of the opposite character.
Gentleness, it is true, is one of the most efficacious of all
the means of persuasion; and it is nowhere more suc-
cessful or more becoming, than in the pulpit. But, as
force is not violence, so neither is gentleness tameness.
“ He is gentle, and not fearful,” is one of the truest of
those just and beautiful discriminations which are the
charm of the great dramatist, in his exquisite delineations
of the various shades of human character.
The act of expression, whether it is performed by the
voice, the eye, or the hand, or by the natural union of
them all, demands a living force. It may be moderate;
but it must be spirited. It requires that easy and skilful,
perhaps gentle, exercise of force, which characterizes the
decisive touches of the artist, and which gives prominence
and life to the figures of his canvas. It is the farthest
thing possible from tameness and feebleness. Power of
expressive utterance, is the positive electricity of the soul;
it implies a percussive force of will on the organic frame;
its natural language is energy of voice and gesture.
The tame speaker wearies his audience, and sends

indifferent to any effect; their minds
mere blank.
The feeble speaker excites the pity of his
hearers; they sympathize with the organic weakness
under which he seems to labor, and leave the place of
assembly, utterly unimpressed with any feeling but of
compassion for the preacher personally. Had he but
exerted his organs sufficiently to fill with his voice the
building in which he spoke; had he but given a hearty
emphasis to his utterance, or a manly energy to his tones;
had he not allowed himself to “mutter like the wizard
behind the wall;" had he permitted himself the just force
and decision of a messenger empowered to deliver an
authoritative message ; — how different might have been
the result ! His subject might then have penetrated
every mind, and impressed every heart : his audience
might have departed lamenting, if anything, their own
lack of spiritual life, not the feeble style of the preacher.
BOLDNESS, TIMIDITY.
A reckless boldness of manner, is repulsive in any
speaker, and, most of all, in him who addresses his fel-
low-men on sacred themes. It is utterly at variance with
the spirit of gentleness and tenderness which was mani-
fested by the preacher's great Exemplar. Yet, owing to
the absence of the moulding influence of true culture,
how often is an audience harangued from the pulpit in a
style of address which implies no respect for the speaker's
fellow-beings.
This style is usually characterized by an ungoverned
loudness of voice, a violent emphasis, an unmitigated
vehemence of tone, a perpetual sweeping and jerking of
the arm, and a frequent clinching of the fist. It is true
that such a style is often the unconscious result of the

73
speaker's force of conviction and fullness of feeling, in
regard to his subject rather than the persons whom he is
addressing; and that the idea of a bullying effect in his
style, never, probably, occurred to him. But one season-
able suggestion from his teacher at school, would have
sufficed to guard him against this obstacle to his useful-
ness, by leading him to recognize the difference between
a manner which merely expresses the excitement of the
speaker himself, and that which moulds this very excite-
ment into an eloquent effect on others.
The timid or the diffident speaker, on the contrary, who
has not, apparently, the courage, or the self-possession to
lift up his voice in an audible sound, and whose hand
seems glued to his side, and his whole body paralyzed, -
so that he appears a statue-like personification of con-
straint, — unavoidably imparts to the feelings of those
whom he addresses a degree of the irksomeness and mis-
ery under which he himself is laboring. Whatever he
would attempt to say, becomes, as it were, frozen in the
act of issuing from the mouth. His arm, if it ever rises
to an action, makes but an approach to gesture, and only
leaves the eye more sensitive to the want of it.
The embarrassed speaker, with his suppressed and im-
perfect utterance, and cowed, hesitating action, does not
even fulfil the organic conditions of address; he falls
equally short of reaching ear, eye, and heart. His matter
may be rich and strong, - his composition eloquent; but
-
all is lost for want of that courage which a little training
and practice might easily impart, and which would inspire
the due boldness that becomes a man addressing his fel-
low-beings.
There is, undoubtedly, a good as well as a faulty bold
ness. The preacher, if true to his subject and his heavers,
will often have occasion to exert the former. It then be-
comes an element of appropriate manner and just effect.
It is, in such circumstances, indispensable to sincere feel-
ing and true eloquence, not less than to good elocution.

ence.
The too bold speaker is apt to add to the bad effects of
apparent indifference to the presence of his hearers, that
of a repulsive harshness of voice and aspect, a fault at
variance with everything like persuasive or genial effect.
Sternness and asperity of expression preclude the speaker
from access to the heart, and seal the mind to his influ-
Yet inadvertent habit, in the absence of culture,
has sometimes stamped such a manner on the preacher.
The energy of such speakers soon becomes vehemence,
and their vehemence, apparent anger. No wonder that
they should displease, rather than win their hearers.
Faults of this description are usually matters of utter un-
consciousness to the individuals who commit them. They
are often the results of mere constitutional austerity and
ill-regulated force of expression. Ten minutes of the so
much derided practice before the looking-glass, would re-
flect so faithfully to snch speakers the visible image which
they present, that they could not tolerate its associations;
and the reform of mien and aspect would unavoidably
extend its softening influence to the voice.
An insipid, simpering, blandness of manner, is certainly
a very undesirable trait in any speaker. It is peculiarly
silly or ridiculous in a preacher; he is the ambassador of
Divine truth; and, if he understands his office, is clothed
with a higher dignity than can be conferred by man. His
office entitles him to speak as one having authority.
But the spirit of love which should breathe from the
preacher's lips, will diffuse its genial amenity over his

THE CULTIVATION OF FORCE.
Modes of cultivating Force.
-
The cultivation of elocution with a view to the acqui-
sition of due force of manner, a style free from all the
faults of feebleness and tameness, — requires a proper
attention to health and vigor of body, as an indispensable
condition of energetic expression in utterance and action.
The weak and constrained speaker may become effective
and free, by due exposure and exercise. The flaccid
muscle, and the enfeebled nerve, will thus acquire tone;
the voice will become sonorous; the arm energetic; the
attitude firm ; the whole manner impressive.
The sedentary life of the student and the preacher,
subjects them to weakness of body and languor of spirits,
and predisposes them to feebleness in voice and action.
They need double care and diligence, for the preservation
of that healthy tone of feeling, which alone can ensure
energy cf habit in expressive utterance.
To such measures should be added a constant resort to
all the genuine sources of mental vigor; the attentive
study of the effects of force in all its natural forms, in the
outward phenomena of the universe; in the varied shapes
which it assumes in all the expressive arts, — particularly
in music, sculpture, and painting, and, most of all, in
written language.
The express discipline of the voice, with a view to the
acquisition of organic force and vocal power, in the modes
prescribed in the volume on Orthophony,* will fully re-
ward the student, by the command which it will give him
over his organs, and the fullness and energy which it will
impart to his tones. The daily practice of vigorous dec-
lamation, aided by the study of the principles of gesture,
as laid down in the Elocutionist,† will enable the profes-

sional speaker to acquire that force in action, which is an
indispensable part of effective and impressive delivery.
а
Modes of subduing excessive Vehemence.
The only effectual means of correcting faults of exces-
sive force, such as violence, undue boldness, harshness of
manner, and similar qualities, must be sought in an entire
revolution of taste and habits. The speaker whose style
is marked by such blemishes, must learn to perceive the
appropriateness and moral beauty of gentleness, dignity,
calmness and composure of mien and action, moderation
of voice, and amenity of manner, in him whose office is
sacred in all its associations, and whose habitual expres-
sion should breathe the spirit of humanity and love.
The unseemly vehemence which degrades the pulpit
to the level of the popular arena, implies a grievous error of
judgment not less than of taste. It involves a fatal defect
in the whole mental structure and character of the speaker
himself. The sense of fitness and of beauty, must, to
such individuals, be a matter of acquisition ; it can be at-
tained only by means of attentive study and close obser-
vation. Discipline must, in such instances, be applied as
a corrective to taste and tendency; eloquence should be
studied in its power to soften and subdue; the heart
should be subjected to the calm and gentle influence of
nature, the tranquil beauty of art, and the tender breath-
ings of such poetry as that of Cowper; the spirit should
be moulded by the softening touch of refining intercourse
in elevated social life; a genial sympathy with humanity
should be acquired by habitual benevolent communica-
tion with its sufferings and depressions. The speaker's
whole manner may thus be formed anew, and acquire
that moderation and that mildness which are the charac-
teristics of genuine eloquence.

FREEDOM, CONSTRAINT, RESERVE.
77
FREEDOM, CONSTRAINT, RESERVE.
An indispensable trait of manliness, not less than of
eloquence, is entire freedom of manner, arising from due
self-reliance, and, at the same time, that self-forgetfulness
which is naturally caused by a speaker's interest in his
subject. A modest estimation of his own powers, a
proper respect for others, and a profound feeling of the
importance of his subject, are not incompatible with per-
fect ease and self-possession. Embarrassment and con-
straint, indeed, are not unfrequently owing to that vacil-
lation of attention, which allows the speaker's mind to
vibrate between the duty before him, and the conscious-
ness of his personal relation to it. The unity of his mental
and bodily action, would remain unimpaired, were his
whole mind absorbed in his theme: the disturbing self-
conscious reference would thus be precluded; and his
manner would be concentrated in earnest, impressive ut-
terance.
Freedom, self-possession, and ease of manner, would
seem to be the natural condition of man addressing man;
and these traits would be the spontaneous concomitants
of public discourse, if education in early life, were properly
regulated. But this advantage is not enjoyed, in the pres-
ent forms of school routine. The exercise of declamation,
which is the only training prescribed for boys, is too
formal and ceremonious in its style, to lead to free, un-
embarrassed manner in address. The subject of his
declamation is usually too abstract and general, or of too
conventional a character, to permit the young speaker to
identify it with the workings of his own mind.
The ex-
ercise is accordingly performed in the spirit of mechanical
routine, as a task to be undergone, -as an unmeaning
ceremony
The unnatural position of the juvenile speaker, en
rasses him ; and his whole style is constrained and

-
ward. His voice is smothered by his conscious inability
to utter aright the sentiments which he is expressing:
his emphasis is quelled by the conviction that his feelings
are unnatural to him : his tones, uninspired by genuine
emotion, deviate into an arbitrary chant: his action be-
comes, from the consciousness that he is performing a
part, — forced and unnatural. The inevitable result of
such processes, is, that the habits of the boy are moulded
into forms which indicate constraint as inseparably asso-
ciated with the act of declaiming. At no subsequent
stage of education is this association broken up; and it
continues to hang, as a visible load, on the habitual man-
ner of the professional speaker.
The injurious effects of misdirected education, in this
particular, are frequently perceptible in the elocution of
the pulpit. The preacher often seems, in consequence
of these, to be going through an irksome process, from
which it would be a grateful relief to be set free. His
suppressed voice, his imperfect utterance, his reserved
tones, his constrained mien and posture, his confined, an-
gular, hesitating, awkward, half-executed gestures, all
seem to indicate the prisoner of restraint, rather than the
voluntary speaker.
A little preparatory training would save the young
preacher from this process of suffering and exposure, and
enable him to deliver his message with, at least, the due
degree of composure and self-possession. The reserve
which diffidence throws over the speaker's manner, is ut-
terly at variance with that spirit of sympathy and commu-
nication, which is the true source of speech. Earnest and
impressive address is incompatible with a manner which
seems to withhold rather than impart the thoughts and
feelings of the speaker, — to suppress rather than to give
utterance to his emotions. The preacher then becomes
the messenger who keeps back rather than delivers his
ruage: the man is virtually unfaithful to his trust. His
nce leave him unimpressed with the spirit of the

communication which it was his office to make, and to
which all his energies should have been devoted.
The easy, self-possessed speaker, on the contrary, im-
parts composure by his very manner. His flowing speech,
and unconstrained action, cause his thoughts to glide
easily into the mind. His unembarrassed and natural
utterance finds its way immediately to the sympathies of
his audience: persuasion dwells on the very accents of
his voice: he seems to mould the mind at will : he se-
cures the attention by winning both ear and eye: his
hearers follow the strain of his remarks without effort :
their complacency with the speaker predisposes them to
receive the truths which he inculcates.
An easy, unconstrained style, in speaking, is more de-
pendent on culture and practice, than is any other trait of
elocution. Attention and diligence, however, are the only
conditions on which a speaker can become effectually
master of himself, as to outward manner. Early educa-
tion, if it were what it should be, would mould all culti-
vated men into habitual ease in expression, from their
first attempts at speaking, in boyhood. But our present
arrangements at school and college, do not call the indi-
vidual into practice often enough to allow him to feel at
home in the act. The process of criticising, too, whether
it is performed by the teacher, or devolved on the speak-
er's class-fellows, is customarily limited to the indication
of some prominent faults, after the exercise is over. This
practice may prune and repress and chill; but it never
can inspire and guide and develop and warm and invig-
orate. Its usual effect is to restrain and embarrass. The
student feels, in the exercise of declamation, that he is
speaking before critics, for the express purpose of being
criticised. He knows he is not uttering his personal feel-
ings to sympathetic listeners; and his reserve of manner
betrays the fact of his conscious condition. He studies
coolness and correctness, rather than earnestness and
warmth. He shuns the natural glow of feeling and ex-

pression, and quenches rather than cherishes the spirit of
eloquence*
Early education ought to exhibit and implant principles
which would anticipate and preclude the growth of false
habits. A preventive regimen should be adopted in this,
as in every other branch of culture. The office of instruc-
tion is to preöcupy the mind, and infuse truth, rather than
to eradicate error, — 10 form and mould and strengthen
the power of expression, rather than to trim excrescences,
- to inspire genuine emotion, and to infuse true grace,
rather than to correct the petty crrors of judgment, or
check the transient excesses of feeling, and castigate the
venial errors of immature taste. These offices, it is true,
form a part of the duties of the faithful teacher. But
they are the mere “mint, anise, and cummin,” compared
to "the weightier matters of the law.”
The spirit of finical criticism invariably turns away the
speaker's attention from his subject to himself. It troubles
his mind with an embarrassing self-consciousness, which
constrains his manner, and cools his emotion.
The professional speaker has to labor under the disad-
vantage of a long course of such training. No wonder,
therefore, that his style should be unnatural and con-
strained, as a result of habit and association. Against
such evils the student who would form his manner to a
free, expressive character, must necessarily watch, and
zealously guard himself by constant practice. His chief
aids will lie in the attentive study of the freest and most
natural of all the forms of expression, those which are
presented in the perfect products of art, - more particu-
-
larly those of sculpture and painting. He will be assisted
by the daily practice of reading and reciting from the

largely, to the unrestrained freedom of style, which results from the
modes of Southern education, during the early period of life.

freest and most flowing language of poetry. He will de-
rive still more benefit from accustoming himself to the
vivid recitation of the most natural and expressive pas-
sages of the drama. No exercise in elocution is so con-
ducive to frecdom of manner as this. *
The general effect on the preacher's style of address in
the pulpit, as regards due freedom and facility, is, no
doubt, dependent on the extent to which he accustoms
himself to mingle with society, and contract that familiar-
ity with man which renders the office of communicating
with him easy and spontaneous. The secluded student
is little prepared for one main office of the ministry, -
that of free, unembarrassed utterance. Like every other
art worth mastering, it requires of every individual, cul-
ture and practice, as the only conditions on which he can
attain skill and facility.
VARIETY, MONOTONY.
Sentiments which possess force and interest to the
mind, though they sometimes run comparatively long in
one channel of feeling and expression, do not pursue an
undeviating, unvarying course. The natural tendency of
impressive thought, is to call up varied emotions and di-
versified forms of imagination. The appropriate commu-
nication of such thought, implies, therefore, a varying tone,
aspect, and action. Trite thoughts may justify a monot-
onous manner of expressing them. But public address,
especially from the pulpit, forbids the presentation of
thread-bare topics and insignificant ideas. We pardon
these in the aimless movement of unpremeditated con-

-
versation, but not on occasions when numbers are assem.
bled to hear important and impressive truths.
The popular complaint, therefore, that preachers are
deficient in variety of manner in their speaking, — al-
though sometimes an arbitrary objection, founded on a
vague and general impression, regardless of particular
circumstances which may happen to forbid variety, - is
by no means destitute of foundation. Sermons are too
commonly written after the fashion of academic themes
on prescribed common-place topics. The mind of the
writer pursues, in such cases, an unexciting, mechanical
routine of thought; his pen betrays the fact in its trite
language; and his tones, — his very looks and gestures,
– repeat the effect to ear and eye, in flat and wearisome
monotony.
The defects of early education, which, in other points,
are so injurious to manner and so destructive to eloquence,
reveal themselves distinctly here. The speaker in the
pulpit carries with him the deadening influence of years
of false habit and lifeless utterance, contracted from the
neglect of his style in youth ; from the custom of declaim-
ing, in an unmeaning and inexpressive way, passages
either unintelligible or uninteresting to him; and, some-
times, from the stiffening effect of the arbitrary directions
which he has received in the shape of formal instruction.
The lifeless tones of school reading, are still haunting his
ear, as an unconscious standard ; and he consequently
observes the beaten round of a uniform force, a uniform
pitch, and a uniform gait of voice, destitute of expression,
— the primitive tone of no meaning and no feeling, which
he instinctively and very justly applied in childhood, to
what he could neither understand nor feel, - but a tone
which inveterate habit has made natural to his ear. To
such modes of voice the preacher not unfrequently adds
a lifeless stillness of body, and an insipid sameness of
gesture, which produce a similar effect on the eye to that
which his utterance exerts on the ear.

The fault of monotony is, if anywhere, unpardonable
in the pulpit, where the speaker has the range of the uni-
verse, for his subjects, and the topics of spiritual and eter-
nal life for his habitual themes. Why should the elocu.
tion of the preacher be almost proverbially monotonous ?
Why should it so often furnish just ground for the sleepy
hearer to devolve the fault of his condition on the preach-
er's voice ?
The easy remedy for this state of matters, lies in the
study of elocution, and the cultivation of expressive tone
and action. A knowledge of the principles of audible and
visible expression, will enable the student to trace the
natural and appropriate difference of tones, and to identify
every mode of utterance with its peculiar characteristic
emotion. It will be impossible for him, afterwards, to mis-
take a dead level of voice for expressive variation. The
discipline which the study of elocution prescribes, will
enable him to acquire that command over his organs by
which he may easiiy execute every transition and change
of expression, which appropriate utterance or action re-
quires. He will thus learn to substitute, for his pipe with
one note, or his harp with one string, the natural, varied
and powerful effect of man's living voice, inspired by
varied emotion. He will be enabled to resume something
of that vivid effect of bodily attitude and motion, which
made him, in childhood, the envied model of the orator,
in the freedom, variety, and efficacy of his expressive
action. The ever-varying style of Scripture will, thence-
forth, no longer be misrepresented by his flat sameness
of voice; the inspiring hymn will not have its appropriate
effect quenched by the morbid dullness of his heavy style
of reading; nor will his discourse any longer operate, by
its “sleepy tune,” as a soothing soporific.
The diligent cultivation of his manner, will enable the
preacher to breathe life and freshness into all its aspects,
and infuse a corresponding effect into his ministrations.
The subjects which he presents, will naturally assume

their appropriate and most striking lights, and fall upon the
mind with their full force of effect. His hearers instead
of reïterating the old complaint regarding the Sabbath,
What a weariness is it !” will leave the sanctuary with
hearts refreshed and reïnvigorated, and minds stirred

MANNERISM, ADAPTATION, APPROPRIATENESS.
One of the common results of inadequate or misdirected
early culture, in regard to elocution, is, that the style of
young speakers, is so soon permitted to settle into fixed
mannerism. An observer who has opportunity of tracing
the successive stages of development in individuals sub-
jected to the customary routine of education, will perceive
that the preacher in the pulpit bears, upon his style of
delivery, the stamp of the same characteristics by which
he was distinguished as a youth at college, and as a boy
at school. This fact, were it the natural consequence of
the growth and evolution of individual character and
original tendency, - were it a spontaneous product of
a
genius, — would be not only tolerable but positively
agreeable, as a trait of elocution. The objection lies in
the obvious fact, that the manner is arbitrary and conven-
tional, a mere matter of acquired habit, a compound
result of the influence of academic precedent and exam-
ple, blending with a few accidental peculiarities of per-
sonal tendency. For the speaker in the pulpit is often
found reading his sermon with precisely the same tones
and inflections, and the same gestures, with which he
declaimed at school, when doing his best to play the ju-
venile representative of Cicero pleading against Verres,
or Chatham rebuking the inhumanity of Lord Suffolk.
The preacher may be discoursing on the worth of the

55
soul, and the vastness of eternal interests, and the danger
of tampering with them; but habit has set so irrevocably
the key of his voice, that the whole sermon sounds, -
sentence for sentence, cadence for cadence, an exact
copy of the utterance with which, when a candidate for
college honors, he read his essay on the rhetorical traits
of eminent writers.
The habit of reading and declaiming sentences as such,
which results froin the uniformity of custom at school,
converts every paragraph into a succession of detached
sentiments, each marked by an identical “ beginning,
·
middle and end of tone in the voice : no matter what
the difference of style or of subject. A similar effect is
produced on gesture. Action is limited to two or three
forms, – perhaps, not even more than one,- - perpetually
recurring, whether the natural emotion connected with
the language of the sentence be joy or grief, complacency
or aversion, courage or fear.
An early culture adapted to the purposes of expression,
would make the young pupil sensitively alive to the diff-
erence of character and effect in the feelings of the heart,
as expressed in the various tones of the voice, and the
diversified language of mien and action, in the body. It
would convert the human organs into so many instru-
ments obedient to the skilful touch ; uttering, with un-
erring certainty, the exact music of each emotion, as it
rose in the soul of the speaker. It would impart pliancy
and grace and power to every member of the corporeal
frame, in the act of executing the forms in which imagi-
nation naturally embodies the thoughts and feelings of
the mind, when animated by the spirit of communication.
Eloquence, in its external shape, would thus resemble
the natural effect of the shifting lights and shades and
the changing colors of the mental scene.
Elocution, were it duly cultivated, would teach the stu-
dent that the perpetual recurrence of one tone, one pitch,
one force, one inflection, one uniform melody, and one
8

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
sing-song cadence, is as untrue to nature, and to the facts
of language and sentiment, as it is false to feeling, and to
the ear.
The study of elocution would teach the indis-
pensable lesson, that one sentiment inspires one look and
action, and another, another, — that there is no more truth
or consistency in using one movement of the arm, or one
attitude of the body, for every sentiment and every sen-
tence, than there would be in using one form of words,
for the structure of every period in a discourse. The
natural shadings of emotion and sympathy, are, in fact,
infinitely more diversified in the aspect and expression of
the countenance and the person of the speaker, than they
can ever become in the most pliant phrases of speech.
The negligent speaker often justifies his mannerism,
on the ground of personality. Speaking of his prominent
faults, he will say, “ This is my natural manner : I like
to see individuality of style in delivery, as in all other
forms of expression ; and this trait constitutes mine. I I
cannot change it for another; because that other, though
perhaps better in itself, would not be natural to me."
This reasoning would be as sound as it is plausible in
itself and comforting to indolence, were habit and nature
invariably the same in individuals, and were manner in-
evitable and immutable, like Richter's cast-metal king.
But manner in expression is the most plastic of all things:
it can be moulded, at will, to whatever shape a decisive
resolution and a persevering spirit determine. Attentive
cultivation will reform, renovate, and re-create, here, as
extensively as elsewhere. It will enable the individual
to shake off the old and put on the new vesture of habit,
and to wear it, too, with perfect ease, as the true and the
natural garb of expression. For all genuine culture is but
the cherishing or the resuscitating of nature.
A good writer is recognized by that perfect command
of his pen, which enables him to vary his language with
his subject; and he is the most successful in written ex-
pression, who can most easily and effectually give the

changing aspect of thought its shifting hue of style. So
it is with the good speaker: his manner ever varies with
his subject : with him, every passing emotion has its ap-
propriate mode of utterance. He is like the skilful and
accomplished performer who ranges over the whole com-
pass of his instrument, and forever draws forth new
echoes of sympathy from the heart, in response to its
changing tones. The natural and effective speaker, by
the eloquence of his varying utterance, infuses fresh life
into thought, and affects the soul of his hearers as the
breath of morning or of spring. The factitious style of
the mannerist, when it is strongly marked, attracts our
attention to itself, and obscures our impression of his
thought; but, even when it is comparatively weak, it still
hangs as a veil between the subject and the hearer's
mind : its tendency is not to add but subtract effect; it
deducts something from the impression which would
otherwise have been made. A manner well adapted to
matter, is not merely a transparent medium: it sheds light
on the objects of the mental scene: it has the kindling
effect of sunlight on the landscape; it brings out into dis-
tinct and impressive effect, the form, color, and character
of whatever it touches.
To remove the defects of mannerism, and to secure the
advantages of adaptation and appropriateness in delivery,
the speaker's great aim should be to lose himself in his
subject, and in every successive part of it, as it is devel-
oped in the progress of his discourse. His style will thus
acquire its proper analogy to the sunlight and the shade,
the life and the repose, the alternate brilliancy and the
depth of effect, which nature gives when sun and shadow
are shifting over the field, in correspondence with the
passing cloud. The mannerist holds to himself, and to
his accidents of personal habit, - and these perhaps quite
artificial, - rather than to the current of his thoughts and
their natural accompaniment of emotion.
The speaker who is desirous of possessing the charm

of fitting manner, will train his voice to the genuine ut-
terance of every tone of emotion; he will endeavor to
acquire all that depth which the most impressive of his
themes demand, in those tones which are the natural ex-
pression of solemnity and awe; he will cultivate the
power of giving voice to those thrilling notes of joy and
rapture, in which the lofty strains of sacred lyrics so fre-
quently abound; he will study the effect of force and
grandeur and sublimity in swelling the tones of praise
and triumph; he will watch the transition to the subdued
and softened strains of penitence and contrition; he will
distinguish the slow movement of pathetic and solemn
emotion from the accelerated utterance of cheerful and
lively expression. His outward manner, in attitude and
action, will be as various as his voice: he will evince the
inspiration of appropriate feeling in the very posture of
his frame; in uttering the language of adoration, the slow-
moving, uplifted hand will bespeak the awe and solem-
nity which pervade his soul; in addressing his fellow-
men in the spirit of an ambassador of Christ, the gentle
yet earnest spirit of persuasive action, will be evinced in
the pleading hand and aspect; he will know, also, how
to pass to the stern and authoritative mien of the reprover
of sin ; he will, on due occasions, indicate, in his kindling
look and rousing gesture, the mood of him who is em-
powered and commanded to summon forth all the ener-
gies of the human soul; his subdued and chastened ad-
dress will carry the sympathy of his spirit into the bosom
of the mourner; his moistening eye and his gentle action
will manifest his tenderness for the suffering : his whole
soul will, in a word, become legible in his features, in his
attitude, in the expressive eloquence of his hand; his
whole style will be felt to be that of heart communing
with heart.
The mannerist in speaking is often cut off from the
possibility of attaining to the effects of genuine eloquence,
by the inappropriateness of his fixed habit to the language

99
and the sentiment which he is uttering. Mannerism is
usually the predominance of one trait, which has more or
less exclusive character attached to it. The vehement
mannerist, accordingly, when addressing the sufferer
whose heart is well-nigh crushed under the weight of
calamity, jars the whole sympathetic nature of his hearer,
by the inappropriate and revolting violence of his tone
and action. His
very
consolations may assume the ex-
pression of scolding. The feeble mannerist, when em-
ployed to arouse an assembly from spiritual supineness,
soothes them to sleep by his lifeless humming tone, and
the sway of his waving, spiritless action.
One of the most obvious traits of mannerism, and one
which nothing but the assiduous practice of elocution can
do away, is that mode of utterance which is, in popular
phrase, called "a tone.” The fault implied by this term,
consists in the continual recurrence of a particular mode
of voice, in emphasis, inflection, cadence, or " expres-
sion,"* but, more frequently, in the “ melody,"+ or pecu-
liar notes, which characterize a speaker's vocal habits.
This species of mannerism in speech, has been ex-
pressly designated by Dr. Rush, the great analyst of elo-
cution, as a "drift” or obvious tendency of voice, in the
effect of one repeated trait of utterance, on the ear.
Every passion, or strain of emotion, has a distinctive
drift,” a tendency to repeat certain qualities of ex-
pression; and the effect arising from change of direction
in " drift,” by the natural shifting of the vocal current,
with every new emotion, in successive passages, consti-

the voice executes in a given strain, clause, or phrase. Thus, awe is
characterized by the recurrence of low notes, and inclines to monotony;
joy, traverses the scale, from low to high, and from high to low, and is
marked by variety; interrogation slides up the scale; and the cadence of
a sentence glides downward.

tutes a marked peculiarity of animated, true, and expres-
sive style, — alike in conversation, in reading, and in
public speaking.
The fault of mannerism in utterance, substitutes, for
this appropriate variation of voice, an arbitrary recurrence
of sound, not authorized or required by the nature of the
emotion which, in a given passage, ought to set the key
and guide the style. The reader, in consequence of this
fault, utters not the meaning and spirit of his author's
language, but the song of his own arbitrary and acciden-
tal habit. He does not change the character of his utter-
ance, with the varying sentiments of the composition; but
while the most striking changes of feeling are obviously
indicated in the phrases which he is enunciating, he con-
tinues to repeat his identical melody, with no attempt at
variation. He goes on executing, with undeviating pre-
cision, one and the same inflection at every comma, and
one and the same cadence at every period, — be the
sense or the feeling of the sentence what it may. His
voice is like a hand-organ set to but one tune: it may
be kept going by the hour, the day, or the year; yet it
will give out but the same succession of sounds.
A ready ear may catch a preventive lesson, as regards
this fault, by listening to the natural variations of voice,
in conversation, and thus enable the reader to mould his
utterance to diversity of effect. But empiric methods
imply no definite and certain aims, and consequently no
sure results.
The reader or the speaker who aims at the
style of conversation, as his model, if he succeeds in
bringing his vocal habits out of mechanical and unmean-
ing“ drift,” if he frees himself from the formalities of a
mere “reading tone,” — is apt, on the other hand, to ac-
quire that characteristic “ drift” of mere conversational
style, which is, literally, a "talking tone,” – too versatile,
-
too vivacious for the dignity of public reading or speak-
ing, - and fit only for easy and careless communication
by the fireside.

INDIVIDUALITY OF MANNER.

The power of applying musical distinctions to the vary.
ing sounds of the voice, will be of great service to the
reader, by rendering his ear discriminating as to vocal
effect. But the modes of voice which come under the
special cognizance of elocution, must be studied by them-
selves, in exact detail, by all who wish to acquit them-
selves thoroughly to the duty of public speaking. The
close analysis which Dr. Rush has exemplified in his
Philosophy of the Voice* enables every student who is
willing to take the pains, to become expert in the discrim-
ination and execution of every point of vocal expresssion.
The application of the elementary distinctions exhibited
in that treatise, will effectually remove every trait of fac-
titious manner from vocal babit in elocution.
INDIVIDUALITY OF MANNER.
Mannerism in delivery not unfrequently passes for the
real excellence of individuality in style, - a trait which,
-a
so far from possessing any artificial character, is the ex-
pression of spontaneous life and eloquence. But this
feature of expressive power, is, like many others, de-
pressed by the deadening influence of formality and
routinė in education. Boys at school are left to sink into
one uniform mould, in their habits of utterance and action :
their exercises possess so little life and interest to their
minds, that to perform such tasks with natural spirit, and
as a part of their own mental action and experience, is
impossible. Juvenile declamation, accordingly, wears, in
most instances, the second-hand air of a thing done as
others do it, and because others do it. It is allowed to

consist of a certain unmeaning loudness of voice, a sing.
ing and swelling utterance, and a given upraising of the
hand, — all bearing the stamp of prescription, and habit,
and average style. The formality, indeed, of the usual
staple of language in declamation, seems, of itself, to pre-
scribe just such uniform manner in every speaker: there
is nothing in it which speaks to the heart of the individ-
ual, and brings out the inner man, with his own peculiar
tones, and looks, and actions.
Could teachers and parents be content to let boys utter
their own sentiments in their own language, the result of
exercises in speaking would be very different from what
it is. Boys would, in that case, speak as boys, not as
"potent, grave, and reverend ” seniors. Every juvenile
speaker would give his heart to his work, and would bring
out his own manner. The teacher would then take his
true place as a friendly guide, prompter, and aid, not as a
cool critic and ex-post-facto executioner: he would assist
the pupil in bringing out his native impulses of thought
and feeling, in forms adapted to his own nature. Speak.
ing would thus become a spontaneous and pleasurable
function of the individual ;- habit would grow into natural
and accordant forms, revealing the genuine mental life
that lay under them.
The prevalence of neglect and perversion, in our cus-
tomary modes of education, suffers every youth, as he
enters a place of instruction, to be cast into the academic
mould, and come out precisely like the rest. He carries
with him, accordingly, into subsequent stages of life, the
impress which he has thus received: the school tone,
somewhat deepened and amplified, and the school ges-
ture, somewhat strengthened, may clearly be traced in
the man, even at the bar and in the pulpit.
The effects of neglect and of erroneous training, are
conspicuous in the prevalence of uniformity of manner
among clergymen. The act of delivering a discourse is
apparently, in many cases, a process of repeating certain

prescribed tones and gestures which every individual is
expected to go through very much like all others. The
natural diversity of temperament and character, is not,
to judge by appearances, — considered an appropriate ele-
ment of effect.
A good speaker, it is true, will always merge himself
in his subject, and never obtrude himself at its expense.
But thought, even the most abstract, when it passes into
expression, is, like the purest water, naturally subjected
to the tinge of the channel through which it flows. The
individuality of the man should never be lost in the for-
mal function of the speaker. There is no law of neces-
sity that
every sermon should be a succession of low and
hollow tones, false inflections, mechanical cadences, and
stereotype gestures ; - the whole manner so proverbially
unnatural, that, among juvenile classes at school, when
one pupil would sum up, in one expressive word, his criti-
cism on a fellow-pupil who has spoken in a heavy, uni-
form style, he says of him, “ He does not speak, he
,
preaches."
The study of elocution, if it were duly attended to, as
a part of early education, would enable the young speaker
to recognize and trace the natural differences of manner,
which ought to exist in individuals, in their modes of ap-
plying the same general principles. The genuine char-
acteristics of expression, are so numerous and varied, that
they afford vast scope for the natural diversity of action,
in different mental and physical constitutions. The ele-
ments of effect, blended in one expressive tone, amount
sometimes to more than six or eight, even in the un-
studied utterance of a person utterly illiterate. The tem-
perament and tendency of an individual, therefore, may
well be expected to cause him to lean to one more than
oihers
among
these elements.
The enunciation, for example, of the phrase in devo-
tional address, “ O Lord !” may receive its reverential
effect in the utterance of one speaker, from its deep and

solemn pitch, chiefly ; in that of another, from its majestic
fullness and swell ; in that of a third, from its prolongation
and slowness of sound; whilst all these properties may
still be traced united in the style of each; with this dis-
tinction, only, that while one quality preponderates in one
speaker, another may in another. A similar remark ap-
plies to gesture. Constitution and temperament may
incline one speaker to one shade of difference in the line
or the force of an action, and another to another; and yet
both may coïncide in the general style and effect.
Our prevalent modes of education permit all individual
tendencies to be swallowed up in one engulfing routine
of neglect or prescription. The preacher, therefore, under
the influence of such early training, comes before us di-
vested of that native originality of manner, which is so
distinctly felt as the eloquence of private communication.
To recover his individuality, he must reform and renovate
his whole stole of speaking, so as to let his own nature
shine through it. In address, heart" only is the loan for"
heart. But how seldom can its throb be felt through the
enveloping folds of false and formal habit!
The preacher who would successfully discharge the
duty of his office, must acquire the power of throwing his
personal character into his manner. Mere elocution is a
poor substitute for the living sympathy of soul in the man
who addresses us. The former, even when it is perfect,
gains only admiration : the latter wins the whole heart,
and convinces the mind, at once, of the speaker's sincer-
ity, and of the truth of what he utters.
We hear, sometimes, a just complaint of the influence
and tendency of ceremony in religion. But no robing or
costume so effectually enwraps the soul, as a ceremonious
tone, which offers to the ear the language of the office
and not of the man.

DIGNITY, FAMILIARITY.
95
DIGNITY, FAMILIARITY.
Man's upright form and noble stature are naturally at-
tended by dignity in movement and action. An erect
attitude, a lofty carriage, a commanding air, are charac-
teristic even of the savage who spends his days in little
else than asserting his dominion over the brutes, or com-
municating with his fellows whose habits are but a little
more elevated than those of the animals which they hunt.
Civilized life, by its enervating influence, brings down the
erect and heroic mien, and the fearless demeanor, which
are natural to man, while consciously sufficient to him-
self, and independent of factitious support. The courtesy
and the condescensions of refinement, bring along with
them tameness and feebleness in manner and in charac-
ter: a bland and flexible exterior takes, in t'e forms of
conventional habit, the place of the manly and majestic
port of nature.
The transition from childhood to manhood, is attended
with similar effects on the aspect and deportment of the
human being. The unconscious, unabashed child ex-
hibits, often, the noblest forms of attitude and action.
The school-boy loses his self-possession, and shrinks and
cowers, in the consciousness of being observed : he lacks
the decision, the firmness, and the dignity of manner,
which he possessed in earlier life, when mingling with
his equals and companions. The bearing of the youth
gives still stronger evidence of being vitiated by self-con-
sciousness, and overweening regard for the estimation of
others. The speaker, who, in the maturity of manhood,
addresses his fellow-beings, manifests, not unfrequently,
in his crest-fallen air, in his hesitating utterance and em-
barrassed actions, his want of conscious elevation and
power, and betrays the fact that he does not approach the
task with a manly reliance on himself and his subject.
Self-respect seems to desert him, when subjected to ob-

servation : his nature appears to shrink, rather than to
expand, with the circumstances in which he is placed.
Eloquence, the result of expressive power, is a thing
unattainable in such a situation ; for eloquence implies
freedom, manly firmness, and force, a genuine moral cour-
age, a conscious elevation of soul, a positive inspiration
of mind. It presupposes that the speaker stands, for the
moment, above those whom he addresses, for the very
purpose of lifting them up to the level of his own views
and inspiring them with his own feelings. The persua-
sive condescension of the orator is never incompatible
with the native majesty of man.
The preacher, more than any other speaker, should
evince a just consciousness of the noble nature of his
commission. Haughtiness, undoubtedly, or arrogance of
manner, is utterly incompatible with the meek spirit of
the Christian minister. But a due sense of the dignity
of his office, should breathe an air of genuine nobleness
into all his expression. It should equally forbid a disturb-
ing and degrading consciousness of the presence of his
fellow-nien, and an unbecoming remissness or familiarity
of manner, on his own part, by which he might seem to
let down his just self-respect, or his regard for the sacred
office which he is called to fill.
One mode of address by which the pulpit is lowered in
the estimation of the world, is that undigaified familiarity
of tone, which some preachers assume, under the impres-
sion that such a manner is the proper way to be easy
and
natural in utterance, and thus to gain access to the minds
of their hearers. The line, in such cases, is not drawn
between conversation and mere talk, much less be-
tween private and public conversation. Simplicity, natu-
ralness, and directness of style, all demand an analogy to
serious and elevated conversation, in the utterance of the
preacher But the dignity of the pulpit forbids all talking
familiarity and slipshod ease which border on carelessness
of air and manner. The sacredness of association with

which the place and the man are invested, should be felt
by the preacher, not less than the people, as a barrier of
sanctity against every freedom which tends to desecrate
the pulpit.
The leaning and lounging attitudes, and the slack, fa-
miliar gestures in which some preachers permit them-
selves to indulge, bear more resemblance to the air of the
toil-worn rustic, resting his wearied frame on the fence-
rail, as he chats with his neighbor at the close of the day,
than to the deportment of one who is or should be fulfill-
ing a nobler function than was ever imagined in the high-
est conceptions of the ancient orator. It is true that dig-
nity is not stiffness, nor decorum constraint. But some
speakers in the pulpit seem never to have drawn the line
that separates freedom from negligence and slovenliness
of manner, ease and self-possession from low familiarity
and nonchalance. If there is one spot on earth where
the stamp of vulgar habit and association is disgusting, it
is the pulpit, which even the grossest minds are inclined
to regard with veneration. Nor is it going too far, to as-
sert, that nothing has so strong a tendency to diminish
the
proper influence of the pulpit, as the remissness of its
occupant, regarding the first requirements of personal
dignity in him who conducts the office of public worship,
and presents, for the time, the living impersonation of
religious sentiment.*
* The slovenly habit of former years, of allowing the hand to repose
in the pocket, used to extend itself to some pulpits. A negative rule
of attitude is, in all forms of address, that the speaker's right hand
should be by his side, when not raised in gesture, as the very dropping
and the stillness of the hand are properly parts of the effect of gesture.
The act of addressing a public assembly, implies that the speaker is in
possession of sufficient health and strength to stand on his feet, and to
support his own weight. It forbids, therefore, the sluggish habit of
leaning on surrounding objects. Dignity of carriage forbids equally
the indolent air produced by resting one hand on the side, on the back,
or anywhere on the speaker's person. Convenience and freedom of
manner allow the left hand to repose on or near the speaker's notes, so

PULPIT ELOCUTION,
A few hours' attention to the subject would enable the
preacher to recognize the appropriate traits of becoming
dignity and elevation of manner, and to avoid habits
which are offensive to the general sense of propriety, not
less than to refined taste. A single glance at the mirror
in his room, while the speaker was at practice, would be
the most effectual admonition to guard against those
writhings of the body, noddings of the head, and jerkings
of the arm, which degrade the preacher into the free and
easy debater at a club-meeting. A few weeks' study of
the principles of gesture, would open up to the mind a
whole world of association, and of law and principle, re-
garding attitude and action. It would mould the speak.

glaring errors of habit, if it did not inspire appropriateness
and grace.
The stately dignity of deportment, which, in former
years, was the distinguishing trait of the Christian gen-
tleinan and accomplished scholar, in the pulpit, has pass-
ed away with the noble race of men who exemplified its
effects. The polish of private life from which it sprung,
has, to say the least, obviously declined. But the change
leaves something wanting to the heart. The authorita-
tive mien of the old divine, had, perhaps, something in it
of the arrogance of office. But in taking away the con-
ventional elevation of manner, we have removed with it,
a portion of genuine dignity. The reformation which has
“popularized” the pulpit, has lowered its tone, and lim-
ited its influence on the preacher as well as on the
people.
as to cxccute, when needful, the indispensable act of turning the leaves.
But nothing can warrant the unseemly, uncouth, and awkward habit of
supporting the body with each hand resting on one side of the cushion,
or that of reposing with one elbow embedded in it. The former trick
leads, unavoidably, to the consummation of ungainly appearance, by
rendering it necessary that, when the speaker becomes earnest, he should
manifest it by wriggling his vertebral column, instead of obeying na-
ture's law, and using his hand in gesture.

FORMALITY.
99
FORMALITY, PRIMNESS, RIGIDITY.
One effect of manner, which impairs the life of pulpit
eloquence, is formality of style. A professional, ceremo-
nious intonation, and a technical, measured solemnity of
mien and action, are the characteristics of this mode of
delivery. The speaker's whole aspect, his voice, and his
gestures, are, in consequence of this fault, tlırown, appa-
rently, into a mechanical mould which has left its impress
on the whole man, and prevents the possibility of his ex-
pressing himself with a natural, life-like effect.
Preachers of this class are distinguished by a marble
fixedness of features, an habitual upturned eye, a heavy,
hollow, and uniform tone, a rigid and laborious style of
movement and action. This stereotype manner precludes
everything like adaptation to change of circumstances or
of subject. The man becomes, in such cases, too much
of an automaton, to impart spiritual or intellectual life to
others. He kills rather than awakens sympathy: he
renders himself incapable of arousing or interesting the
mind. His fixed formality of manner converts devotion
into ceremony, and worship into soulless routine : it ren-
ders preaching an unmeaning and unprofitable piece of
custom.
Solemnity and decorum are, undoubtedly, the aim of
the speaker, in all such instances of manner. But the
mechanical and labored style, and the literal character of
the whole affair, produce, unavoidably, an exterior rather
than an interior effect. The origin of the fault of formal-
ity, seems to be the general impression, stamped in early
life, that the pulpit is necessarily associated with certain
looks and tones. The preacher himself yields uncon-
sciously to the influence of such impressions, and com-
plies with it, in his manner of speaking. The result is
that he moulds his style into a decorous gravity, or a deep
solemnity, more than into an earnest and living expres-

sion of his personal sentiments. He assumes, uninten-
tionally, an air and an utterance which are not, properly,
his own, but part and parcel of his profession.
The study of elocution prescribes the easy and certain
remedy for such habits, by accustoming the speaker to
analyze his tones, and trace distinctly the difference be-
tween the mode of voice which betrays a factitious utter-
ance, and that which comes warm and true from the
heart, with the inspiration of the moment fresh upon it.
The preparatory discipline in elocution would enable the
student to awaken and vivify his voice, and modulate its
expression into the natural variations of personal feeling,
without which there can neither be life nor eloquence in
speech.
Formality, in the case of some speakers, assumes the
ſecble form of primness of manner, with its sparing voice,
precise articulation, nice emphasis, fastidious inflection,
meagre tone, and mincing gesture. This prudery of style
is not unfrequently exemplified in the pulpits of New
England, in consequence of the anxious precision and ex-
actness of habit which are so general as local traits. The
speaker's whole manner seems, in consequence of this
cadency, to be weighed and given out with the most
scrupulous and cautious regard to rigorous accuracy of
efect in petty detail. Elocution becomes, in such cases,
a parallel to the transplanted tree, trimmed of all its
natural life and beauty, and, for the time, resembling, in
its quaintnes and rigidity, rather a bare pole, than a pro-
duct of vegetable nature.
The result of such a manner is to anatomize and kill
feeling, - not to inspire it: the head is, in this way, al-
lowed to take the place of the heart. Exact discrimina-
tion and subtle nicety of intellect, preponderate, usually,
in the effect of such speaking on the hearer : his affec-
tions are left unmoved : he is unconscious, throughout the
discourse, of one manly impulse or strong impression.
The priin, guarded, neutralizing manner of the preacher,

seems, in such instances, the appropriate style of co!dness
and scepticism, rather than of a warm and living faith.
The fault of undue precision of manner, may be traced
party to the influence of undue anxiety about mere literal
exactness, partly to the absence of manly force and inde-
pendence of character, and partly to faulty education,
which has led the speaker to pay more regard to the effect
which he produces on the understanding and the judg-
ment, than that which he exerts on the moral sympathies
of his audience.* The last of these influences accus-
toms the school-boy to precision and point of emphasis,
and speciality of inflection, more than to earnest energy
of utterance and impressive emotion. Early habit, thus
directed, leads the student and the preacher to a cor-
responding mode of address, and involves all the defects
of an over-pruned manner, with its unavoidable results
of cool and fastidious preciseness, which offers nothing
to the heart, and therefore leaves undone the great busi-
ness for which the preacher addresses mankind.
Formality of manner in speaking, is sometimes caused,
in part, by an unbending rigidity of habit, which is plainly
legible in the unyielding features, stiff postures, and stiff
gestures, of some preachers. These faults of habit in
address, are partly owing to false impressions regarding
manly firmness and dignity, partly to the want of free and
genial and extensive intercourse with the world, and part-
ly to an early culture deficient in the means of imparting
flexibility and grace to the mental and bodily faculties.
It is a matter of frequent observation among the people

given by a popular lecturer on local peculiarities of character, to his

terms rules and regulations. The parties, after much expenditure of
logic, “concluded upon the whole, that 'rules' would best apply to a
canal, and regulations' to a railroad."

of other countries, and a fact noted also by English
writers, themselves, that the characteristic manner of the
English, is ungainly and rigid, in comparison with that of
other nations. A sullen taciturnity of habit, a surly brev-
ity of reply, a constrained stiffness of posture and motion,
and a confined, reluctant gesture, are the predominating
national traits in daily intercourse. The New Englander
seems to inherit a full share of the hereditary stiffness
and constraint, though not of the taciturnity and bluffness
of the family stock. This feature of the common lineage,
becomes haughtiness in the Englishman. But in the
New Englander it degenerates into mere rigidity and un-
meaning stiffness.
A genial early culture, and a wide intercourse with
mankind, tend equally to render the human being plastic
and flexible: they give him the power and the spirit of
self-adaptation; they give him ease and fluency in ad-
dress, and the power of eliciting sympathy from others.
But the general defect of established modes of education,
is that, from the absence of due provision for the devel-
opment of man's social and moral nature, youth is left
destitute of appropriate aids to the formation of exterior
manner in the daily communications of private life, and
in the act of public speaking.
Hence it happens that we so often see the juvenile
speaker on the academic stage, rigid in posture, and awk-
ward in movement and action. The want of early train-
ing leaves him utterly deficient in the natural ease and
grace
of a cultivated and polished youth. His body seems
nailed to the floor, his members galvanized into metallic
stiffness, his head glued to his neck, his eye motionless
in its socket, his arm pinioned to his side. His whole
visible mien and movement are those of an ill-adjusted
machine. His yoice, too, possesses the same inflexible
character, in its monotonous utterance.
A degree of this style continues to exert its injurious
influence on the college student and the professional man.

RIGIDITY
10:3
A rigid, inflexible air, and a mechanical stiffness in ges.
ture, are, accordingly, in many instances, the habitual
style of the speaker in the pulpit. These faults unavoid-
ably attract the attention of the audience to the preacher's
personal manner, more than to his subject; as a messen-
ger of ungainly, rigid manner and aspect, presents him-
self, rather than his message, to those whom he accosts.
And, even when the mind has become somewhat enured
to the fault of manner, there is still a hinderance caused
by it, in regard to any effectual access to the feelings.
Men naturally refuse to yield the sympathy of the heart
to a speaker whose manner is so inappropriate in point of
judgment and taste. The stiff attitude and inflexible
features do not solicit and win attention; and the rigid
arin and rigid hand are incapable of executing a motion
which shall come as an appeal to the heart.
The correctives for rigid habit in a speaker's manner,
are, in part, to be sought in the cultivation and refinement
of taste, by which the mind is guarded against every in-
couth and repulsive effect in expression. An excellent
remedial influence will always be derived from habitual
contact with the ease and polish of elevated society. The
meliorating influence of the fine arts should ever be so-
licited by the student whose purpose is to addict himself
to public speaking. But the express study of gesture, as
a part of elocution, will exert the most direct influence on
manner and habit. It will lead the student to discern
the character and effect of every attitude and action of
the body. It will teach him that there is no escape from
the impression which external manner produces; that the
speaker who neglects this part of elocution, incurs the
effects of inappropriateness and awkwardness, and, some-
times, of self-contradiction, in the discrepance between
the style of his gesture and the language of his tongue;
that he who flatters himself with the hope of escaping
inappropriate manner by avoiding action, gives, by his
statue-like and motionless posture, the lie to any earnest-

ness betrayed in his voice. Earnestness warms and im-
pels the heart; and, by the law of our constitution, the
same nerve which glows and quivers at the fountain head
thrills along the arm to the expressive hand, and solicits
its action. The rigid speaker who attempts to counteract
this effect, kills, equally, his own emotions and those of
his audience: he destroys the natural character of com-
munication, and defeats its purposes.
PROPRIETY OF MANNER.
Nothing so effectually prevents the existence of elo-
quence in a speaker's manner, as a fastidious primness in
his style of utterance and action, which hems him in on
every side, and allows him no latitude of tone or scope of
expressive action. There can be no interest felt in the
address of a preacher whose whole elocution is so pruned
and pared that it is utterly destitute of the natural free-
dom and flow of life.
It is not less true, however, that if there is any form of
public speaking, in which a strict regard to propriety is
demanded, it is that of a discourse delivered from the
pulpit. The comparative freedom of manner, in the ac-
customed forms of general society, among us, ought to
inspire a noble dignity of address, in our public speakers.
Its actual effect, however, on individuals, is often to cre-
ate an indifference, or even recklessness of deportment,
which is anything but appropriate, in connection with
sacred oratory.
The following is as literal a delineation as the writer's
command of words enables him to give of impressions
received by him, from the manner of an eminent preacher.

pulpit steps, and, on entering the pulpit began rubbing
his hands in compliment to the cold air of the wintry
morning, — dashed open the leaves of the Bible, - rattled
off a few verses in the style of the most violent hurry,
calling out the words in rapid succession, - implored a
blessing on the services in nearly the same style of voice,
- read the hymn after the fashion of a lively paragraph
in a newspaper,
- called out a prayer in which every por-
tion - adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and petition,
all alike, had no slight resemblance to the style of military
command, or of popular harangue. The sermon, in its
bold, rapid, and vehement style, was eloquent with the
tones of the most indignant invective, accompanied by
the effects of the most arrogant and dogmatic expression
of head, eye, and person. The speaker's whole manner
embodied the language of natural signs, in a style so
marked and fierce, that a phrenologist would have found
his eye instinctively wandering over the surface of the
preacher's head to trace its associated indications in the
regions of "combativeness” and “self-esteem," in confir-
mation of his theory of human tendencies.
The moral proprieties of the pulpit, are not, it is true,
very often violated to this extent. Yet we frequently
hear tones, in the exercise of devotion, which the ear is
accustomed to recognize as those of deciding, ordering,
and commanding, rather than of supplicating. We hear,
sometimes, a strain, in prayer, which reminds us rather of
familiar talking than of devotion; we hear, sometimes, in
a sermon, the tone of domestic scolding; and we see, oc-
casionally, in the speaker's manner, the frown of personal
anger, and the clinched fist of the popular partisan.
All these undeniable indications of misdirected and un-
modified habit, are unintentional, — in effect, at least.
They are the natural results of unrestrained and undisci-
plined violence of personal tendency in the individual :
they are, to him, but the expressions of earnest feeling.
Yet could a friendly hand present to the speaker's eye,

in one of his paroxysms of excitement, the reflection of
his own countenance and figure in a mirror, he would
need no other monitor to remind him, that how natural
soever these results of emotion might have become in his
own habits, or innocuous to himself personally, they are
grossly immoral in their effect on others.
A very moderate degree of attention to the study and
practice of elocution, would assist speakers of this stamp
to subdue the voice to the tones of decency, and the per-
son to the aspect of decorum, and to win the hearers
whom they otherwise disgust and repel. The discipline
of elocution, in its connection with the pulpit, if it is true
to its purposes, suggests to the speaker, that, in sacred
oratory, the chastening spirit of Christian meekness, is
ever a most eloquent though silent effect.
Many preachers, whose temperament and habit secure
them from the moral improprieties of manner, fail in the
due observance of that species of propriety, which has
been termed obedience to the code of minor morals. The
legion of negligent, not to say low, personal habits, which
defective early education, at home, leaves so generally
prevalent among us, as a people, are by no means exclud-
ed from the pulpit. It may be sufficient, here, to allude
to the Scottish preacher stopping, in the midst of his dis-
course, to regale his nostrils with their wonted portion of
snuff, as finding his “pendant” in the picture of our own
Southern preacher attending, in the face of his congrega-
tion, to the nauseating process which necessity or habit
entails on the chewing of tobacco. We forbear, likewise,
to enlarge on the gross offences committed against decen-
cy, in the not unusual act of combing the hair with the
fingers, during the intervals of active duty ; – the public
-
exhibition and display of the handkerchief which has just
been employed to prove its very serviceable character in
cases of catarrh ; – the tooth-pickings and nail-cleanings,

which is often more a necessity of habit than of disease;
the lollings, and loungings, and leanings, and multiform
free and easy postures occasionally exhibited.
When, amid sights of this description, the hearer hap-
pens to advert to the fact, that the preacher is, for the
moment, the ambassador of Infinite Majesty, the shock
of incongruous feeling is too much to be endured. The
preacher's standard of personal manner ought certainly to
be at least as high as any that the highest elevation of
genuine taste and refinement has ever established.
The study of elocution would, in relation to propriety
of effect in aspect and bearing, suggest, in a single lesson
of a few minutes' duration, the few practical rules which
are requisite to mould the outward man in habit. Even
a very slight attention to the preliminary rules of posture
and movement, would exert such an influence on the
associations of the mind, as would insure a tendency to
becoming style in personal carriage and demeanor. The
preacher might thus be saved from habitually committing
revolting offences against taste and propriety, and so
avoid the barrier which, otherwise, he builds up, with his
own hands, between himself and his hearers.
WARMTH OF MANNER.
Feeling, when it is earnest and vivid, rises naturally to
those stages which we designate by the terms “warmth "
and “ fervor.” These qualities bear the same relation to
eloquence, that the “ lyric fire” does to the higher species
of poetry. The element of “passion” is indispensable to
all the transcendent effects of expression, in whatever
form or in whatever art they are exemplified. Homer
and Horace, among the poets of antiquity, and Milton
and Watts, in modern times, display, in high perfection,
this genuine trait of excellence in expression.

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
Empassioned utterance, or that which rises to the full
height of inspired and inspiring emotion, and attains to a
vivid eloquence, is indebted, for its characteristic effect,
to the “celestial fire ” with which it glows. Intensity and
ardor in the desires and aspirations of the soul, — the very
fervor of its highest devotional feeling, — all are evinced
by the “burning words” which seem to issue direct!
from the heart.
This highest form of emotion demands a correspondent
intensity and empassioned power of utterance. We hear
it in the voice of the orator, when kindled by vivid per-
sonal feeling transcending the formal limits of art. We
hear it in the recitation of poetry, when the speaker gives
forth the poetic fire of genuine, intense emotion. We
hear it in the true and appropriate reading of the raptu-
rous strains of the prophets and the psalmist, in the sacred
Scriptures. It belongs, also, to the empassioned aspira-
tions and devout ecstasies of the soul, in the language of
the higher species of hymns. Its effect may be heard in
the utterance of the preacher whose lips have been touch-
ed with the “ live coal from the altar," and whose soul is
aglow with those emotions which spring from near inter-
course with God and fervent feeling for man.
The inspiring thrill of genuine passion pervades all
earnest eloquence, in whatever form it kindles the heart
and fires the imagination of man. As a mood of emotion,
it exists, in degree, even in the humbler forms of public
address on ordinary occasions, if these imply life and
spirit in expression. Its effect is, in all cases, analogous,
more or less, to the communicative heat which imparts
itself from object to object, till all are enveloped in the
common fiame.
The electric spark from the vivid and
eloquent speaker, is thus transmitted to the sympathies
of his audience, till all are thrilled by the common impulse,
and fired with the common glow.
The speaker who never rises to warmth and fervor of
feeling, falls short of the highest and noblest purposes of

eloquence. To the preacher in the pulpit there is an im-
pressive lesson to be caught from the spirit of the poet's
phrase, when he speaks of “the seraph that adores and
burns.” A noble zeal cannot exist without ardor; devo-
tion cannot inspire the soul, without fervor ; the heart
cannot beat for man's highest good, without warmth.
Some preachers, it is true, give themselves up too ex-
clusively to the influence of this element of eloquence:
their fire degenerates into frenzy: excessive passion is,
with them, allowed to usurp the whole man: their man-
ner becomes that of animal excitement, and deviates into
extravagance and excess. Hence the ungovernable vio-
lence of voice, in such speakers, and their frenzied vehe-
mence of gesture.
Other preachers, however, err on the other extreme,
and by their uniform coldness of utterance and frigidity
of gesture, chill the feelings of their hearers. The special
office of sacred eloquence, is to incite and inspire and en-
kindle the soul. But the effect of the too common style
of the pulpit, is to cool and to benumb. How can the
preacher cause the heart to glow with the sacred fire of
love or joy, whose accents“ freeze as they fall,” and
whose torpid frame seems to have been transmuted to
marble ?
Questions of intense interest are justly expected to ex-
cite ardor of feeling and glow of expression. Men, in
relation to such subjects, are generally more willing to
pardon something to the spirit of warm emotion, than
to be content with deliberate coolness. Heartfelt and
earnest conviction will not stop short at ordinary manifes-
tations; it will incline rather to a fervor of utterance and
action, at which fastidiousness might be apt to take
offence. There is, occasionally, something irrepressible
in genuine emotion. He who speaks from the inmost
soul, is himself sometimes carried away in the common
rush of feeling which his own eloquence has caused.
The preacher who deeply feels the worth of the human

soul, the brevity and uncertainty of life, and man's prone-
ness to callous indifference regarding his eternal well-
being, cannot contemplate the case coolly, and treat of it
in well-ordered sentences, and quiet tones, and remon-
strate upon it with tranquil mien and composed action.
The deeper sources of feeling must, in such circumstan-
ces, necessarily be stirred within him : the inner fire of
the soul must be kindled : his whole being will glow with
intense emotion: his tones, if true to his heart, will be
fired with a sacred fervor: his features will beam with
empassioned expression : his whole frame will be inspired,
his arm impelled, by the zeal and ardor of his spirit.
Coldness of manner is, in some speakers, a fault of
habit which originates partly in constitution and temper-
ament. But, in most, it is the consequence of imperfect
or ill-directed culture. Faults of the former description
are by no means so obdurate as is sometimes imagined.
The testimony of the physiologist is clear and decisive on
the point that, with adequate attention and care, we can,
by processes of cultivation, change the temperament of
individuals from the muscular to the nervous character.
The discipline of education, in ancient Greece, was con-
ducted so as to blend and unite these temperaments, in
every individual, by a high-toned physical training, ac-
companied by the most elevated forms of intellectual cul-
ture, and an intense incitement applied to the sentiments
and passions. The magnificent ideal of human excel-
lence which Grecian education set up as its standard,
was fully attained in the personal and mental character
of such men as Xenophon and Epaminondas, — instances
in which the attainments of the philosopher, the states-
man, the general, the scholar, the poet, the orator, the
artist, the athlete, the moral enthusiast, were all blended
in the individual man.
Modern education aims principally at the development
of a few of the intellectual faculties.
It leaves the gen-
eral character cold and feeble, from the absence of health-

ful vigor of body, and inspiring energy of heart and will.
It represses emulation, and limits ambition, but substi-
tutes no inciting motives of equal force and of higher
character. Its tendency to excite the cerebral organ, by
too great intensity of action, causes, by its morbid excess,
a correspondent depression of genial emotion and enno-
bling sentiment: it leaves feeling and fancy, - the main
sources of expression, — to languish and subside. It fur-
nishes no adequate instruction in the art of speaking, but
rather quenches or cools the spirit of eloquence, by inap-
propriate influences.
Few, accordingly, among our youth, retain the natural
glow of utterance, through the various stages of educa-
tion, so as to come out warm, energetic, and effective
speakers. The young minister in the pulpit, commences
his career of public duty, disabled, to a great extent, for
the discharge of its functions. He has, in his academic
life, lost, not gained, tone and power, as a living man,
whose office it is to exert, by eloquent address, the most
momentous of all influences on his fellow-men. The
cold and powerless being who rises to address us from
the pulpit, bears, not unfrequently, on his very frame, and
in his voice and aspect, the traces of infirmity — not of
strength. His words fall lifeless on the ear: his senti-
ments take no effect on the heart.
The introduction of elocution into our means of educa-
tion, would do much to obviate the impediments to effective
speaking, under which professional men generally labor.
The systematic practice of elocution, as an art, involves
a healthful preparatory training in muscular exercise and
in the energetic, varied, and graceful forms of oratorical
action. It prescribes an extensive course of daily prac-
tice in all the modes of voice which tend to invigorate
and enliven the organs of respiration and of speech. It
imparts the inspiring influence of eloquent emotion, in
the themes with which it makes the student conversant.

It incites his whole mental being to vivid and glowing

These invaluable results may all be secured, to a great
extent, by whatever individual has the requisite decision
of purpose and perseverence in resolution, to commence
and prosecute the business of self-cultivation. The the-
ological student who feels the importance of elocution to

more fully the sympathetic influences by which the heart
is actuated, as well as those outward analogies and effects
which eloquence implies. He will allow himself the full
benefits of a regenerating physical and æsthetic discipline,
to compensate for the defects of formal education. He
will resort to the instructive lessons furnished by all the
expressive arts. Music, in particular, he will cultivate, as
one of the most effective and inspiring of all influences
that operate on the human soul, as the best adapted to
create the expressive mood and the glow of utterance.*
He will omit no means of cherishing the life and activity
of imagination, - that faculty which, in our prevalent
modes of culture, is left nearly dormant, but which, by its
tendencies, decides the character of the orator, not less
than of the poet; the power of expression, in every man,
being as his ability to find a vehicle or a mould for his
thought, which must otherwise be "without form and
void.”

nishes, in ample abundance, to the diligent student, the
means of acquiring and cherishing expressive power in
voice and action. It enables him, by analysis, to detect
the peculiar nature of every tone of feeling, to trace the
effect of life and warmth in every element, to sympathize
with these, and to acquire them as habits of utterance
and gesture. A few exercises, attentively performed, will
enable him to recognize the breathing warmth of a full-
hearted utterance, the vivid force and fire of genuine
emotion, the flash of the kindled eye,

SERENITY OF MANNER.
The tendencies of constitution and habit, in some indi-
viduals, incline them to speak, on all occasions, under a
strong impulse of emotion; so that their manner never
possesses the dignity of repose. Speakers of this class
seem to demand excitement, as a condition of eloquence,
and, when interested in their subject, are apt to flash out
abruptly into intensity of utterance and action: they do
not possess the power of holding emotion in check, and
of rising equably, from the ordinary level of their subject
to the higher strains of empassioned style: their delivery
is consequently irregular, abrupt and unequal. The beau-
tiful symmetry and perfect unity of manner, which tran-
quility and self-possession impart, are wanting in the de-
livery of such speakers; and their effect on their hearers
is correspondent: it resembles that of the fitful gleams of
lightning between successive clouds, rather than the
growing brightness which “shineth more and more unto
the perfect day.” When the flash and the peal are over,
there remains “but the cold pattering of rain.”
A general composure and serenity of manner are by no

-
means incompatible with the natural vicissitudes of emo-
tion and expression. But abrupt changes are compara-
tively rare, in the natural progress of thought and feeling:
they are the exceptions, - not the rule of speaking. Some
preachers, however, whether from impulsive habit or in-
correct ear, incline to sudden wren ings of the voice and
jerkings of the arm, which startle rather than impress an
audience.
Others destroy the repose and dignity of their manner
by perpetual restlessness of body, and hacking reïteration
of gesture: they seem to mistake excitement for earnest-
ness, and mere animal vivacity for the inspiration of gen-
uine emotion. A due restraint on personal tendencies,
and a just reserve of manner, are the basis of all true
effect in elocution.
Mere liveliness of tone and action possesses, at the
best, but the humble merit of the wakeful talker. It may,
in fact, serve to dissipate rather than to deepen impres-
sion. The appropriate effects, even of earnestness, vehe-
mence, and fervor, are dependent on the relief which
they derive from a prevalent repose. Arbitrary and abrupt
variation disturbs the current of attention, on the part of
the hearer. The equable speaker leaves the mind of the
audience unruffled and calm, reflecting distinctly every
thought which his eloquence calls up: the abrupt speaker
breaks and shivers every successive mental image, by the
agitation attending his abruptness of manner. The serene
and tranquil effect of appropriate expression, as a charac-
teristic habit, gives the preacher easy access to the mind,
and enables him to hold up steadily before the attention
the mental objects on which he would have his hearers
dwell.
There are, indeed, many subjects and many occasions
on which a quiet, unexcited utterance, breathes the gen-
uine spirit of expressive eloquence. The themes of pul-
pit discourse are not unfrequently of this character; and,
in the management of some, an unequal irregular, and

restless manner in the speaker, would jar upon the ear,
with the disturbing effect of discord in music.
The preacher may ever derive impressive lessons from
the study of symmetry and harmony, as they reveal them-
selves in the beautiful and majestic forms and aspects of
nature, and in the graceful proportions of every master-
piece of art.
Different subjects require a difference of style in elo-
cution, as in all other arts. But the prevalent mood and
spirit of sacred eloquence, should be calmness and seren-
ity. Force and fire of manner will then have their value,
in their place. * But the transition, even to such effects,
is not necessarily violent or abrupt.
A prevalent serenity of manner leaves the speaker at
liberty so to modulate his voice and control his action,
that his very transitions are felt to be as appropriate as
they are striking; while an agitated and hurried utter-
ance, jerking incessantly into unnatural changes of pitch
and force, added, perhaps, to ceaseless motion and ges-
ticulation, — destroys even the effect of variation itself,
and ends in discomposing rather than impressing the
mind.
The manly composure of manner which properly be-
longs to all forms of public address, but especially to the
style of the pulpit, is quite incompatible with a very com-
mon fault into which some preachers are habitually be-
trayed by nervous excitement. This fault evinces itself
in an overstrained expression on the features, and is legi-
ble in the wrinkling or knitting of the brow, in the up-
raising of the eye-brows, and in the staring projection of
the eye. Such effects are unavoidably associated, in the
mind of those who are addressed, with a feeling of pain
or repulsion. Habitual serenity of mien and aspect, does
not forbid the occasional expression of even the strongest
emotion. But it cannot be reconciled with a continued
stare or frown, which seems incompatible with decorum
or self-possession. Offences of this description might all

be easily put down by an occasional glance at a mirror,
when the student is at practice. Without such recourse,
or the admonition of a friend, the unconscious habit must
continue an obstacle to the speaker's success in attaining
to persuasive manner.
TRUE AND NATURAL MANNER.
Eloquence, in whatever form, and, most of all, in ad.
dresses from the pulpit, demands, as a condition of its
effect, a conviction, on the part of the hearer, of the per-
fect sincerity of the speaker. The slightest indication of
artifice, or, even, of mere art, becomes an effectual barrier
between the orator and his audience; as it betrays the
fact that he is not in earnest in his communication, or, at
all events, that he is not expressing himself with the di-
rectness and simplicity which a deep conviction of his
sentiments ought to inspire.
Artifice and affectation are utterly incompatible with
the “simplicity and godly sincerity” which the Scriptures
ascribe to the preacher. ' But the fact of having been ac-
customed, during the period of early training, to utter
sentiment by rote, in the unmeaning and uninteresting
routine of school declamation, has, in most instances,
untuned the ear for the genuine effects of voice, and
reconciled it to false intonation, just as it has misled the
eye, and accustomed it to a mechanical and artificial style
of gesture. The living effect of tone and natural manner,
is thus irrecoverably lost, and, with it, the speaker's power
over the heart: his conventional tone, attitude, and ac-
tion, all plainly indicate that it is the clergyman, not the
individual, who is addressing us. The style, in such
cases, is, at best, too obviously of that secondary grada-
tion of art, which knows not how to “conceal art."

We can trace the absence of single-minded purpose, in
every speaker whose voice evidently assumes à new and
factitious character, when he begins to read or speak in
public; we feel the fact in the false hollowness and af-
fected swell of utterance, which some preachers always
assume in the pulpit; we perceive it in their studied pre-
cision of enunciation, forced emphasis, mechanical inflec-
tion, chanting tone, and arbitrary variations of voice, and
in their premeditated and elaborate motions of the arm.
The whole machinery of effect is thus, as it were, perpet-
ually thrust on ear and eye, at the expense of the great
business of the hour. It is impossible, under such cir-
cumstances, for the hearer to derive the proper impres-
sion from the subject, or to enter into sympathy with the
speaker; and it is well if the result of the whole discourse
is not, unavoidably, a state of dissatisfaction and disgust
with the manner of the preacher, rather than any just in-
fluence from his sentiments.
Earnest and warm feeling will not allow the speaker
to wait for niceties of elocution, in the act of speech.
The preacher who feels that the decision of a soul may
be hanging, for the moment, on the accents that fall from
his lips, will not be found stopping to adjust his inflec-
tions, and mould his gestures. It is quite a false impres-
sion, which is current regarding the practice of elocution,
that it consists in acquiring certain fixed modes of voice,
putting on a certain air, or practising set actions, which,
after a given time, will become natural by habituation,
but which must necessarily be awkward, at first. There
is no such thing as speaking naturally by rule and study,
applied during the act of speech. All, then, must be
left to the guidance of feeling and intuitive perception,
and the influence of unconscious tendencies of taste, pre-
viously disciplined by critical and reflective judgment.
True elocution allows no artificial processes of expres-
sion : it cuts off all false habit. The operation bears no
analogy to that of the dentist, who extracts the natural

implements and substitutes artificial ones. It is a process
of retrenching acquired faults, and recovering original and
natural tendencies, which had been lost, through neglect
or misdirection. Elocution, as a science, enables the
student to analyze, and become familiar with, all the
modifications of voice and gesture. It defines their na-
ture and relations. It teaches him to discriminate, among
them, and to select and apply those which natural emo-
tion, in every instance, requires. It guards him against
artificial effects of every kind, with as strict care as it
does against other faults of manner. It rejects all spuri-
ous tones, as counterfeits offered instead of the current
coin of the heart. It points out every tendency to dwell
on sound rather than on sense and feeling. A false man-
ner, in any particular, it denounces as the worst of all
faults, as an unpardonable violation at once of manli-
ness, truth, propriety, and taste.
Elocution, however, insists, with equal earnestness, on
the student's drawing a firm and decided line of distinc-
tion between natural and acquired habit, as regards the
local accidents of usage, and the general principles of ex-
pression. It allows no servile spirit of accommodation to
some trick of custom which happens to prevail around
the speaker. It requires peremptorily of the New Eng-
land student, that he lay aside his unique nasal tones and
circumflex accents, and frigid, diminutive action, of the
Southern student, that he lay aside his broad drawl, and
mouthing tone, and exaggerated gesture. It demands of
the man of education, everywhere, that he do not descend
to the standard which uncultivated taste exemplifies and
prescribes, but that he adopt a manner which shall bear
the stamp of dignity and propriety, in enlightened judg-
ment, wherever exercised.
Affectation of manner, though apparently originating in
insincerity and art, is often the result of a perception of
common errors, and a desire to avoid them. It proceeds,
sometimes, from the wish to be correct or graceful. It is

119
the natural product of the prevalent neglect of manner
and deportment, which characterizes our modes of educa-
tion. The moulding influence of taste, if applied, as it
ought to be, to the formation of habit, would anticipate
and cut off this reaction of the mind against the conse-
quences of early neglect. A sound judgment and a manly
taste are the only possible security against faults of affec-
tation ; and the cultivation of these traits of mind ought
to form a prominent part of intellectual training. The
systematic study and practice of elocution, may do much
to form and direct the mental tendencies, in regard to
modes and habits of expression; as the principles of the
art involve a recognition of all the distinctive features of
chaste and correct style, not merely in this, but also in
every other art which gives form to thought and feeli
Simplicity, as the grand characteristic of truth and
nature, holds as high a place in elocution as in any other
mode of expressive art; and directness of tone and em-
phasis it enjoins as the straight road to the heart: it for-
bids all attempts at arbitrary modulations of voice, - all
merely mechanical variations for effect. The simplest
and the truest manner it holds up as the most eloquent
and the most effective. The studied changes in which
the speaker passes arbitrarily from soft to loud, from high
to low, and the opposites to these, it condemns as false
to the subject, and destructive to every effect of genuine
and earnest address.
A just view of elocution, while it would cherish every
natural trait of grace in utterance and action, would lead
the student to avoid every trace of manner which indi-
cates a distinct and separate attention to gracefulness.
Every modification of the voice, and every movement of
the arm, which is executed merely because it is graceful,
is untrue to the higher demands of truth and manly ener-
gy. It is something deducted from the weight of a senti-
ment and its power over the mind and heart. It can be
compared only to the juvenile messenger's loitering by

the wayside, to pluck flowers, when urgent business de-
mands speed.
All true grace is inherent in the sentiment which the
speaker utters. It is not a thing which he can superadd
in tone or action. It requires no attention, apart from
that which is due to the thought and the language of the
composition. To linger on poetic tones, or to delay for
studied graces of action, on occasions demanding earnest
and direct speech, betrays an utter ignorance of the first
principles of expression. Beauty itself must, in such cir-
cumstances, lose its character, and become deformity. A
single gratuitous flourish of voice or hand, seals the doom
of the speaker, as to any effect on intelligent and culti-
vated minds. The only effect of such obtrusions of man-
ner, is to lower the hearer's estimation of the speaker, and
to mar the impression made by his subject.
REFINEMENT AND GRACEFULNESS.
Elocution, as an art, while it rejects all spurious beauty
of ornament in manner, as a hinderance to effect, cher-
ishes a just regard for that refinement which is the natural
accompaniment of a cultivated taste. Education is in-
effectual, if it does not extend to the whole mental char-
acter. Classical learning has fallen short of its design, if
it has not left its graceful impress on the imagination, and
moulded the expressive powers into habits of symmetri-
cal and harmonious action. Its office, in the formation of
the intellectual character, is to quicken the sensibility to
beauty and elegance, by the admirable perfection of the
models which it presents for imitation, and which ought
to exert a silent but enduring influence on the associa-
tions and tendencies of the mind.
Society has a right to demand, in the educated speaker,

the fruits of the highest culture, and, among these, a true
elegance and a genuine refinement of manner. The ed-
ucated clergyman owes to society the results of scholar-
ship, embodied in an oratory which is, at least, correct and
graceful. There are, no doubt, qualities and accomplish-
ments which are of vastly higher value than mere grace-
fulness of elocution. No degree of elegance can atone
for the absence of natural, manly, free, and appropriate
manner. But if there is any form of eloquence which
naturally and justly invests itself with the associations
and the language of the highest beauty, it is that of the
pulpit. The wonted themes of sacred oratory, are them-
selves the highest species of poetry; and the preacher
who does not cause this truth to be felt, loses his hold of
one of the most powerful influences on the human soul.
The transcendent beauty of the language of the Scrip-
tures, seems to haunt the ear of all men, as a charm
equally powerful in all stages of life, from childhood to
old age; and the preacher who drinks deepest at the
sacred fount, will ever be found the most eloquent in ex.
pression; - his whole manner will evince the influence
of the discipline of that school in which he has trained
himself.
Nothing can be further from the accustomed associa-
tions of every mind, than the remotest idea of anything
odd, blundering, awkward, or coarse, in the language of
the sacred writers. The principle which causes us to
revolt from such effects in the style and manner of the
preacher, is of the same nature : it is the shrinking of the
mind from the thought of desecration. Yet how often
are our pulpits occupied by men on whom all the beauties
of nature, of art, and even of revealed truth, seem to have
fallen without one perceptible effect on the soul, and who
apparently address themselves to the delivery of a ser-
mon, in the spirit of a laborer setting about a coarse job
of work!

lowest passions and of the vilest associations, the coarse
bawling of utter rudeness, or the harsh guttural sounds
of the “ malignant emotions,” which cause the voice of
man to approach that of the lower animals! How fre-
quently we hear the pulpit, which should be looked up
to, as the model of intellectual efinement and of true cul-
ture, degraded by an utterance which, in the very pro-
nunciation of words, bespeaks the ascendancy of low
associations in the personal habits of the speaker! The
elocution of the pulpit should, in the simplicity and chast-
ened dignity of its inflection, and in the well attempered
moderation of its tones, furnish lessons of true eloquence
to every other form of address. The impression is utterly
false, that the way to bring religion home to “ the busi-
ness and bosoms” of men, is to discourse in the dialect
of the market-place, and to use the tones and gesture of
the street. Lessons of directness and earnestnes, may,
it is true, be gathered from these. But the literal trans-
ference of them to the pulpit, can be suggested only by a
taste which relislıes what is low, and a judgment utterly
blind to the fitness of things. The preacher's office is
not to bring down his subject to the level of his hearers,
but to assist them in rising to that of his subject. Neither
is the rudest mind at all insensible to the becoming grace
of ref nement, as the natural attendant of eloquence, on
themes which are sacred and spiritual in their relations.
FALSE TASTE, ARTIFICIAL STYLE.
But while a coarse and low style of address, is revolt-
ing to every one's natural sense of propriety, the manner
which betrays artificial and studied elegance, seems to
solicit attention to the speaker rather than to his subject.
All merely arbitrary and conventional forms of grace,

FALSE TASTE, ARTIFICIAL STYLE.

seem ridiculous, when brought into contact with those
vast conceptions of the soul to which it is the preacher's
business to give utterance. The speaker who adopts
them, incurs all the degradation of “voluntary humilia-
tion,” and “worshipping the angels” of vitiated custom,
- a thing directly opposite to the idea of the service of
God.
The world justly shrinks from the preacher who, in the
delivery of his discourse, serves up some choice delicacy
of finical manner, some fantasy of ultra pronunciation,
some elegance of mere elocution, when he ought to be
dealing out the bread of life. A mincing, affected manner,
in the tone or action of a preacher, can excite only the
feeling of deep disgust. Nor can the prevalence of coarse-
ness or awkwardness in others, form any plea for the in-
dividual who betrays an artificial and affected manner,
which pleases only his own fancy, but disgusts the taste
of every body else. The coarse and vehement speaker
may justly claim that we pardon something to his earnest-
ness and rough force. But the affected speaker can do
nothing to redeem the littleness to which he voluntarily
descends.
A spurious elegance of manner, it is true, is, not unfre-
quently, the result of false notions of grace, and of a mis-
guided desire to obey the indications of taste. It is not
always an intentional fault: it is contracted, perhaps,
from the unconscious imitation of an esteemed model : it
is a vice inculcated, in many instances, by false instruc-
tion. But, from whatever source it springs, its effect on
delivery is that of insincerity and artifice, or of display:
it is not merely an obstacle but a positive nuisance. No
matter how studiously it aims at grace, it proves but
labored deformity.
The only effectual corrective for false taste in elocution,
consists in the attentive study of genuine beauty, as it
embodies itself in the simple forms of nature and of true
art. Perfect simplicity is perfect grace. Elegance, if it

would not degenerate into fantasy, must not deviate from
simplicity. The highest ornaments of eloquence, are the
truest touches of nature, in utterance and action. Elocu-
tion, as the art which moulds the exterior of eloquence,
necessarily recognizes and obeys the laws which regulate
the higher art to which it is tributary. The best elocu-
tion, therefore, is that which preserves a perfectly simple
and natural manner.
ADAPTATION OF MANNER TO THE DIFFERENT
PARTS OF A DISCOURSE.
One of the common results of defective early instruc-
tion in reading, is the habit of uttering all the portions of
a discourse, - particularly when it is read and not spoken,
- in nearly the same tone; and along with this fault
usually goes that of using, throughout, the same style
and form of action. Appropriate manner would, on the
contrary, exhibit an obvious change of voice, in passing
from the explanatory and quiet utterance of the opening
paragraphs to the argument and illustration by which the
subject is exhibited and sustained, and a still more im-
pressive variation of tone, in the closing application, or
direct address, which appeals immediately to the feelings
of the audience. The whole discourse, (if constructed
on the plan now implied,) would exhibit a progressive
force of voice, from the quiet to the earnest, and thence
to the vivid, effects of utterance. Appropriate elocution
thus renders the reading of a sermon one continuous cli-
max of effect to the ear, by which the hearer becomes
more and more deeply interested or forcibly impressed,
till the close.
A similar remark would apply to the proper style of
action in the successive parts of a discourse. The merely

explanatory statements addressed to the understanding,
would produce little or no gesture, the argumentative and
descriptive passages would elicit a growing freedom and
force of action, as the speaker's own feelings and those
of his hearers became more deeply interested in the train
of thought and the attendant emotions, developed in the
progress of the discourse; and, in the concluding address,
the full eloquence of earnest and impressive gesture,
would naturally be brought out by the heightened interest
of the speaker's mind, in his subject and his audience.
The whole man would now be alive with the spirit of
expressive utterance: the hand would render its full tri-
bute of aid to tongue and eye, in stamping the impress of
the speaker's soul on the sympathies of his hearers.
All sermons, it is true, do not admit of a regular and
systematic progression of effect like what has just been
described. But the consequence of speaking, for an hour,
on one subject, ought naturally to be that of drawing out
more and more of the natural resources of eloquence,
which continuous thought should always have the power
to develope. There ought, perhaps, to be more regard
paid, in rhetorical training, to such modes of treating sub-
jects as would ensure the eloquence of progressive effect.
The lawyer who arranges his pleading so as to bring out
his arguments in successive stages of accumulating force,
and the player who never willingly leaves the stage with-
out a strong effect of voice or action, might afford an in-
structive lesson to the preacher; for it is now too often
the fact that his last point would weigh no more than his
first, and that, at the very close of his discourse, he seems
to have made no progress, reached no conclusion, gained
no position, by what he has read or spoken. The lawyer
who should so wind up his pleading, or the player who
should thus tamely go off the stage, would be justly
deemed to have made an utter failure in his part. The
professional phrase which one barrister sometimes uses,
when speaking of the professional efforts of another, that
11*

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
“his learned brother took nothing by his motion,” would
very often apply most justly to the vague and immethod-
ical, and consequently ineffective speaker in the pulpit.
The principle of climax, or growing force and effect,
should be distinctly perceptible not only in the successive
stages of a discourse, but in every paragraph and in every
sentence which it contains. The preacher's voice and
whole manner should perpetually indicate, in progressive
intensity, that he is consciously drawing nearer and nearer
to the consummation of his train of associated thought
and feeling. The aim of the preacher's mind, as indi.
cated in the increasing earnestness of his manner, should,
during every successive paragraph of his discourse, be
growing clearer and more impressive to his audience, till
his object is fully effected, at the close.
MANNER IN DEVOTION.
The prevalent inattention, in our community, to the
effects of manner and address, are in nothing more per-
ceptible than in the customary tones and attitudes of the
devotional exercises in public worship. Some preachers
cannot, even in such circumstances, abstain from an ir-
regular and revolting violence of voice: their earnestness
seems to know no controlling power of reverence and
decency: their empassioned vehemence of manner seems
to recognize no difference between the tones which might
justly be used in importuning a fellow-being, and those
which are appropriate in entreaty addressed to God. It
is no unusual thing to hear a whole prayer thundered out,
in the accents of imperious command.
What a lesson might such speakers learn of the docile
and respectful child, that proffers its request in subdued
though earnest tones! The child, wiser instinctively than
a

127
the man, is aware that, in such cases, violence shuts, but
does not open, the heart. It adopts, therefore, the irresis-
tible eloquence taught it by nature, and urges its request
in pleading tones, piercing by their very suppression : and
its suit is, in such circumstances, seldom refused.
Some preachers adopt a style which forms the extreme
opposite to the fault of voice mentioned above, and uni-
formly employ a high, feeble whine, in their devotional
utterance; as if an audience with God were a scene of
servile humiliation and abject timidity; as if the act of
communing with the Father of spirits were a powerless
prostration of the soul, and an occasion of mere wailing
and lamentation. The appropriate fervor and sublimity
of devotion, which, not less than humility and self-abase-
ment, are its just characteristics, are thus entirely lost
sight of; and the effect of the whole exercise, is to im-
press upon the mind the meanness of man, rather than
the grandeur and majesty of God.
A voice moulded by appropriate emotion, would impart
to the tones of prayer a degree of the manifold power
which characterizes the grandest of all the instruments
of music, that which we term emphatically the organ,
and which from its majestic compass and effect, we con-
secrate to the office of worship. The deep, full, and
solemn strains of adoration, would then pour themselves
forth on the ear, with a strength but softness of effect
allied to the deep tones of the wind, when breathing low
through the forest, or with something of their ample swell,
when raising the sublime hymn of nature to the power
and glory of the Creator. The pleading and pathetic voice
of penitence would be recognized by its plaintive notes.
The low murmur and broken whisperings of contrition,
the earnest and thrilling intensity of the soul's aspiration
after pardon, purity and peace, the fervent breathings of
heartfelt gratitude, the rapture of devout joy, would all,
in turn,'be felt, as they rose or fell upon the car, in the
successive outpourings of the heart.

The inexpressive, level, mechanical, "recitative" strain,
which is so often heard in the utterance of the language
of devotion, is the most efficacious of all means of quench-
ing the spirit of the exercise, and reducing worship to a
hollow ceremony.
Vividness and fervor of feeling are, in no respect, in-
compatible with the softened tones of subdued and rev-
erential emotion. The chastened expression of earnest-
ness is the most eloquent of all the moods of the human
voice : suppressed intensity of tone penetrates the heart
more deeply than the strongest utterance. The study of
the natural language of expression, with a view to the
discrimination of vocal effects, and the acquisition of true
and natural modulation, cannot be too earnestly urged on
the student of theology. The voice is the instrument of
his usefulness; and surely the ability to use it justly, to
use it skillfully and impressively, well deserves the most
assiduous application of his powers. The measure of
devotional feeling, in an assembly, must ever be in ac-
cordance with the depth and fullness of heart imparted
by the tones of the minister. The cold and dry manner
in which the exercise of devotion is often conducted,
sufficiently accounts for the slight sympathy which it ex-
cites. Yet it would demand no great amount of time,
from the minister, to acquire the power of giving true and
effectual utterance to his inward feelings, and of bringing
his congregation into accordant sympathy. The existing
evil consists obviously in the habit of unmeaning and in-
expressive tone on his part, a habit which neglect or
perversion has allowed to become a portion of his self"
education, but which a moderate degree of study and ap-
plication would enable him to correct.
The attitudes into which the pastor suffers himself to
fall, in the act of devotion, are not unfrequently a cause
of in harmonious and discordant impression on the feelings
of his people. His lounging posture, his sleepily folded
hands, his hanging head, added to his drowsy voice, may

all interfere with the spiritual tendency of the exercise,
by causing the natural law of sympathy with given signs
and effects, to transcend the speaker's power of raising
and exalting the soul; so that a pervading dullness and
apathy, instead of a vivid emotion, shall be the predomi-
nating mood of the audience.
The error, however, lies, in some cases, at the opposite
extreme: the mere ardor of the speaker is suffered to
carry him into vehement contortions of body, and, some-
times, even into violent gestures, in the act of prayer. * A
most impressive rebuke to this animal turbulence, might
be derived from the touching Scripture representation of
the seraphim, in the act of adoration, veiling their faces
with their wings. The stillness of awe is one of the most
obvious traits of tendency in expression. The submissive
mien of reverence; the erect attitude of praise, the up-
lifted hands of gratitude, blessing, adoration, joy, and
ardent aspiration; the humble posture of penitence and
contrition; the clasped hands of supplication and en-
treaty; the folded hands of resignation and submission ;
the imploring outstretched arms;- all speak a natural
language, and have their meaning in the heart of man.
Devotion, destitute of these, may be pronounced decorous
and chaste, and well-bred; but it is false to the great law
of the Creator, that man's soul should find a language in
his frame.

PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION.
-
The preceding brief remarks on manner, were designed
to lead the reader to the study and practice of the promi-
nent rules and principles of elocution. These will be
found laid down, in detail, in the two volumes formerly
mentioned, — the manual of Orthophony and the Ameri-
can Elocutionist, - the former designed to furnish the
modes and means of cultivating the voice, on the system
of Dr. James Rush; and the latter, the rules and princi-
ples of elocution, in connection with orthoëpy, rhetoric,
and prosody, and the practice of gesture. To these
works, therefore, the reader is referred for the full syste-
matic study of elocution, as a science, and as an art.
The design of the following synopsis, is to present those
principles of elocution, which are immediately applicable
to the purposes of the pulpit. Persons who had not paid
attention, previously, to the art of reading, will thus be
furnished with an outline of its most useful parts; and
those who have become versed in its theory, will be pro-
vided with a special course of practice for professional
purposes.
THE CULTIVATION OF THE VOICE.
Capability.
The voice, like every other endowment or capacity of
man, is a gift which bespeaks, at once, the power, the
wisdom, and the beneficence of the Creator. It is an
organ of wondrous power, of exquisite flexibility, of vast

131
CAPABILITY.
compass, of the most extensive range, of inexhaustible
expression. Its capability of intense force is such as to
render it clearly audible, at a distance, on some occasions,
of several miles.* It is capable, also, of executing the
“sound so fine, that nothing lives 'twixt it and silence."
It traverses, with ease, from notes allied, in depth, to the
mutterings of distant thunder, up to those which pierce
the ear with the shrillness of the horn. Its mellow tones,
its softened breathings, and gentle undulations, are the
charm of power to melt the heart to love: its yell of rage
strikes terror into the fiercest of the brutes. Its plaintive
wailings cause the arm of the warrior to fall powerless :
its rousing and thrilling tone of courage, impels “the mass
of living valor” to the cannon's mouth. Its moral and
spiritual effect varies from the soul-subduing reverence
of the strain of devotion, to the revolting violence of the
curse of vindictive wrath. It passes, in a moment, per-
haps, from the whisper of fear to the shriek of terror, or
from the groan of despair to the ecstatic shout of joy.
The natural powers, and capacities of the voice, are
scarcely more wonderful than its susceptibility of cultiva-
tion by the processes of human art. It becomes, even in
the humble culture which it receives, under the training
of maternal care, capable of executing all the varied func-
tions of speech, which are demanded by the daily com-
munications of life. It attains, thus, to the power of giv-
ing utterance to every form of thought or mood of feeling,
as prompting the language of seriousness and gravity, or
of fancy, humor, and wit. The, conventional forms of
speech, embodied in articulate utterance, enable it, to a
certain extent, to keep up with the innumerable and ever
shifting movements of the mind.
* The literal exactness of the above statement, can probably be
avouched, as having been personally verified by other elocutionists as
well as the author. Strong and clear voices, exerted in the form of a
well-vocalized or perfectly musical call, may be easily heard, at a dis-
tance of from one to three iniles, over water, or other level surfaces.

PULPIT ELUCUTION.
The systematic and regulated culture which the voice
receives, under adequate training, empowers the orator to
sway the minds of men, at will, by the consummate mas.
tery of eloquence. It enables the actor to enchain the
attention, and entrance the imagination and feelings of
his fellow-men, in a mental illusion which, for the mo-
ment, catches the very hue of reality. Such is man's
vocal progress, from the helpless wailings of his infancy,
to the triumphs which artistic genius enables him to
achieve by the disciplined utterance of his maturity.
That wisdom of the ancient world, which was derived
from the faithful observation of nature, led to the assidu-
ous cultivation of the vocal powers.
The Greeks con-
sidered elocution as a part of the proper education of man
as an expressive being; but they regarded it as an indis-
pensable preparation for the functions of the orator. The
Athenian mode of discipline for the formation of the voice,
was so extensive as to comprehend a range of practice
requiring the professional superintendence of three differ.
ent classes of instructors, enumerated, by Roman writers,
under the designation of "phonasci," "vociferarii," and
“ vocales.” The office of the first named class, seems to
have been that of moulding the voice as to “ quality,”
the effect of vocal sound, as true, full, and agreeable, or
otherwise, - that of the second, to impart force and com-
pass by rigorous practical training in set exercises, that
of the third, to regulate the vocal habits in regard to in-
tonation and inflection. To the effect of this strictly
vocal discipline was added that of special athletic and
gymnastic exercises, which were likewise arranged and
classified in separate schools, established for the purpose
of securing health and vigor, each by a form of muscular
practice peculiar to itself. Five such schools have been
distinctly enumerated by writers curious on such subjects;
and to all of these it was deemed the duty of the rhetori-
cian to recommend his pupils.
The slight regard paid, in modern times, to the devel-

-
opment, either of the physical or the expressive powers
- of the human being, disposes us to look with an eye of
suspicion and distrust, equally, on the athletic and the
rhetorical discipline adopted by the ancient Greeks. We
are prone to ascribe the one to their passionate love of
external beauty, and the other to their fastidious regard
to intellectual grace and polish: we condemn the whole
process of their culture, as artificial and fantastic; or we
refer their rigor of preparatory training to the necessity of
the case, in the fact that their orators were accustomed
to speak in the open air, and hence required a species of
voice as little applicable to our purposes of speech, as
would be that of a public crier.
The stern character of Demosthenes, the most dili-
gent and indefatigable in training, of all the orators of
antiquity, — forbids, (as was mentioned before,) the very
idea of his submitting to a discipline artificial or fanciful
in its prescriptions; and Cicero himself has borne elo-
quent testimony to the value of the vocal training to
which he subjected himself, when in Greece.
The cultivation of the voice is required on grounds
quite distinct from those of anticipated professional duties.
The vocal muscles and the nerves of expression, (the
great instruments of utterance,) are not only susceptible
of cultivation to an equal degree with the other portions
of the muscular and nervous systems of the human body,
but to a much higher. - The spiritual vividness of their
action,- so important to their power of rendering instant
obedience to the ever-varying requisitions of the mind,
renders these portions of the human frame the most plas-
tic and the most docile of all. There is no form of mus-
cular or of nervous action in which so entire a revolution
can be speedily effected, as that which is exemplified in
the production of vocal sound. A few weeks' daily prac-
tice are, usually, sufficient to produce an utter change of
circumstances, as regards the ability to execute the prom-
inent effects of voice, in " force" and "pitch," — the main

characteristics of utterance, in impressive speaking. The
whole style of voice, as to “ quality," is often changed
from bad to good, within as short a period.
Neglect of Vocal Culture.
Our established modes of education, were they ade-
quate to the purpose of a thorough cultivation of the vari-
ous powers and capacities of man, would furnish ample
provision for the development of the organ of voice, as
the exponent of heart and mind, the connecting link of
man's mental and social being. No exertion would then
be spared by which it could be rendered vigorous, pliant,
expressive, and, at the same time, agreeable to the ear,
by its natural and appropriate music, as a portion and a
most effective one, of the great system of universal har.
mony, which reigns among the works of God.
The prevalent neglect of this divine instrument, de-
signed to contribute its share to the symmetry and the
grace, as well as to the immediate uses, of life, not only
leaves many even of those whose professional duties
render an agreeable and skilful use of it indispensable,
disqualified for their proper occupation, by inability to
exert it aright, but subjects them to pain and suffering
and exhaustion, and consequent loss of health, or even,
ultimately, of life, from unskilful and inappropriate modes
of exerting the voice ; and, as not unfrequently happens
to speakers of this description, it renders, from the same
causes, their whole utterance disagreeable and even pain-
ful to others.
Elocutionists often have occasion, in their professional
capacity, to see instances of the noblest powers of mind
rendered unavailing for the purposes of public speaking,
by neglected habit, or erroneous cultivation, in early life.
A little daily attention to the subject, would have easily
secured, in season, a clear, agreeable, melodious tone to
many speakers who now habitually exert their organs in

such a manner as to thwart the purposes of speaking, and
even to produce pain or disgust in the hearer. Persua-
sion must ever be up-hill work, where a harsh and grating
effect of voice is incessantly jarring the nerves, and un-
doing the harmonious effect of sentiment.
The preacher, more than any other speaker, needs all
available aids of culture, in the use of the voice. His
duties, -as was mentioned before, - require that he
spend a large part of every day in strictly sedentary and
intellectual occupation, - a condition extremely unfavor-
able to the free and energetic use of the organs of speech.
Close study constrains the body, checks the circulation,
impedes equally the functions of respiration and diges-
tion, and is necessarily followed by languor and weak-
A strong, full, and smooth voice, must, to one sub-
jected daily to such experience, be the result of a rare
original force of constitution and vivacity of function,
which unfriendly influences have not had the power to
impair. Rigorous application of mind is injurious to the
character of the voice; as, by impairing, through impeded
and imperfect respiration, the vigor of the larynx, the
glottis, and the vocal ligaments, as well as the bronchial
tubes and the air-cells of the lungs, it generates what
musicians designate as “impure tone,” - that imperfectly
.
vocalized sound, which bespeaks a mode of forming the
voice more or less painful and exhausting, as well as dis-
agreeable to the ear. Frequent access to the open air,
an habitually cheerful mood, and the genial influence of
social feeling, are all essential to the free and agreeable
exercise of the voice. The physiologist can very easily
account for the feeble, thin, hollow, dry, unmusical voices
which are so often heard in our pulpits.
Remedies for Defective Culture.

quires the physical and mental influences of muscular

exercise, recreation, repose, change of scene and occupa-
tion, vocal practice in singing, reciting, declaiming, read-
ing, and whatever else tends to exhilarate the spirits,
promote health, or impart power to the voice.* He should
possess a perfect knowledge of the structure of the hu-
man frame, that he may use his vocal organs intelligently
and effectively, spare himself fatigue and pain and injury,
and be able to sustain long and vigorously the exercise
of the voice in public speaking. Due practice soon ren-
ders an hour's reading or speaking an invigorating and
inspiring rather than an exhausting process. The true
and skilful use of the voice, in these forms of action, is
similar, in effect, to the easy and pleasurable practice of
an hour's singing. A well vocalized tone is, in any case,
the same thing in its nature and formation, and conse-
quently in its effects, both on the vocal organs of him
who produces it, and on the ear of those who hear it: its
character is that of a sound pure, easy, and agreeable,
even in its utmost energy.
The prevalent opinion, that the study and practice of
elocution lead to the formation nf an artificial style of
voice, is founded on one of those false impressions which
ignorance and indolence are so prone to foster as pleas
for error and defect. The elocutionist would say to the
student, Select, for study, the most natural, smooth, and
pleasing voice that you hear in others, and observe its
peculiar properties ; — select the corresponding tones in
your own: cultivate these, and cherish them into habits:
watch the sound of the human voice as it is affected by
ennobling and bland emotions, by courage, joy, love, ad-
miration, tranquility; – dwell on such tones till your ear
has acquired a relish and a thirst for them: your voice
will then become instinctively genial, as a matter of pre-
dilection and tendency. No one whose ear is unperverted,

utters a joyous emotion in a hollow, sepulchral tone, which
habit seems to have fixed irretrievably on some speakers
in the pulpit: no one naturally utters the warm and ten-
der notes of love or admiration, in the cold and hard voice
which so often falls from the mouth of the preacher: the
language of a serene and tranquil spirit cannot be uttered
in the harsh and hacking accents of a controversial dis-
pute; - the calm expanse of the ocean or the heavens,
and the qniet flow of the stream, suggest a very different
lesson to the discerning ear, and prompt the voice to the
placid, smooth, and full yet gentle sounds of entire re-
pose.
Elocution enjoins on the preacher no false depth or
artificial lollowness of voice. It reminds him only of the
natural effect of solemnity, awe, and reverence, in at once
deepening and enlarging and gently filling every vocal
sound, and converting it to a natural and perfect unison
with all those tones of majesty and grandeur, which na-
ture is ever breathing into the car of man, from ocean
and river and forest, from the tempest and the thunder ;
and which flow from the noblest of all the instruments of
music. The practice of elocution leads the minister, in
his acts of devotion, to attune his utterance to the great
laws which the Creator has written on the human ear.
It forbids him to belittle and degrade a solemn and sacred
act by the high, light, and trivial effect of a pitch appro-
priate only to what is trite and familiar and insignificant.
It enables him to select, from the natural range of his
own voice, those notes which even the intuitive percep-
tions of childhood recognize as intimations of the over-
shadowing presence of a great thought, or as the swell of
a vast emotion, rising from the heart to the lips.
Effects of due Cultivation.
The cultivation of elocution will enable the preacher

spired with life and truth and power. The native dignity
of man, stamped on the noble and eloquent accents which
assign him his rank in the creation, will be audible in
every word that falls from his lips.
It would be impossible for an individual whose ear was
once opened to discriminate the quality and character of
sound, to give forth those muttering and grumbling effects
of voice, those guttural and croaking notes, those snuffling
nasal, and wiry twangings, those barking explosions of
unmitigated abruptness, those "softly sweet," effeminate
mincings, by which the pulpit is so often degraded.
To man regarded as an intelligent and gregarious ani-
mal merely, there is something attractive and interesting
in the very sound of the human voice. The awful deso-
lation of utter solitude is never more impressively felt
than when the forlorn being becomes fully conscious of
his forsaken condition, by the oppressive weight of un-
broken silence. This truth the poet Cowper has imaged
most strikingly in his supposed soliloquy of Selkirk, when
he represents him as deploring the doom which condemns
him never more to “hear the sweet music of speech.”
The attainments of distinguished vocalists serve to
show what, in corresponding degree, might be effected by
the due cultivation of the voice, for the various purposes
of reading, recitation, and speaking. Not that a merely
artificial culture can ever be desirable, either for the use-
ful purposes of speech, or the tasteful enjoyment of elo-
cution. But let us select, from the private circle, the
example of voice which best pleases the ear, and most
vividly affects our sympathy, whether in the appropriate
and impressive reading of a page of literature, or in the
freer and simpler form of intelligent conversation in the
social circle, and affectionate communication by the fire-

side. Let us select the public speaker whose voice per.
fectly true, easy, natural, chaste, yet vivid and impressive,
seems to spring directly from the heart of the man, and
to dwell equally on the ear and in the heart of his hear-
ers, as a perfect embodying of the whole soul whence it
sprung Let the instance be one in which the human
organ is felt to be no unworthy channel of the messages
of
peace and love from on high: let it even be one in
which the beauty of perfect excellence seems realized;
so that, as sometimes happens, even in our own day,–
“a world lying in wickedness" is induced to listen to the
prophet, as to "one that playeth skilfully on an instru-
ment,” and to sit, for a time, rapt in admiration of the
music of his voice. Let the supposed example be carried
even so high, it will still be, in most cases, but a speci-
men of what intuitive observation and undisciplined skill
may accomplish. - Suppose, on the other hand, an indi-
.
vidual trained under advantages no more than equal to
those which every vocal musician confers upon himself,
who allows himself the customary opportunities of sys-
tematic and scientific cultivation for successive years.
What might not a speaker so trained accomplish, with
the genius, especially, which insures distinction in other
pursuits, and with a soul absorbed in the spirit of his vo-
cation ?
Training to such extent, (thanks to the philosophic
spirit and enthusiastic application of the great American
analyst, Dr. James Rush !)* has now become a thing
easily practicable to the spirit of diligence and persever-
ance. The means of attaining to high excellence, – to
comparative perfection, are now offered to every stu-
dent of elocution, and exhibited with a perspicuity, pre-
cision, and certainty, which leave no excuse for skepti-
cism or ignorance.

Effects of Cultivation on the “Quality”* of the Voice.
The student who will faithfully apply his powers to
the mastering of Dr. Rush's system, will be enabled so to
use his voice that every truth which he utters, every
emotion which he endeavors to impart, will be carried
home to the minds and hearts of his hearers, “ clothed in
fitting sound.” Every mode of vocality which is essen-
tial to expression, will be fully at his command. We
shall hear, in his utterance, an entire exemption from all
those vulgarisms of voice which degrade the pulpit, when
uttered within its precincts: we shall recognize, in his
tones, the perfect “purity ”4 and subdued manner, which
pathos, tranquility, and solemnity impart:— the ample
and noble effect of grandeur and sublimity, in the appro-
priate style of a voice trained to roundness, smoothness,
and fullness, the characteristic qualities demanded by the
larger dimensions of space, and the stronger incitement
of feeling, in public speaking, as it differs from private
conversation.
* The effect produced on the ear by the mere sound of the voice, as
agreeable or otherwise. Thus, we recognize one voice as harsh, another
as smooth; one as thin, another as full.
+ What the musician denominates “pure tone,” or “head tone,” -
from its resonance in the head, - is nothing else than that perfectly
liquid quality of voice, which is its natural perfection, -
- as is evinced in
the untutored utterance of early childhood, — and which corresponds to
the sound of a flute, when played on by a skilful performer, as con-
trasted with the mere learner, whose manner is recognized in conse-
quence of its harsh and hissing sound.
The perfect voice of the accomplished elocutionist, Dr. Rush has
designated by the introduction of a new but expressive term,
tund," — in allusion not only to the rotundity of its sound, but, also, the
actual position of the interior and back part of the mouth, by which it
is produced.

Articulation.
The well-trained speaker will be distinguished, more-
over, by the perfect exactness yet perfect ease of his
articulation, and even by its brilliancy of effect and posi-
tive beauty of sound, in consequence of the exact adjust-
ment and free play of the organs of speech, in every
function which they perform, and in every sound which
they execute.
A distinct and perfect enunciation is of the utmost ser-
vice to the public reader or speaker; as it not only se-
cures to him the indispensable condition of intelligible
communication, and gives an intellectual clearness and
finish to his style of expression, but, by the definite and
precise character which it imparts to every sound of his
voice, it enables him to dispense with that mere loudness
which would otherwise exhaust his own strength, and
annoy the ears of his audience. Pure tone and distinct
articulation enable a speaker of comparatively limited
vocal power to convey his words, with perfect case,
through a large extent of space. The result is similar to
that which attends the performance of the softest strains
of vocal music, by a skilful singer: the ear loses neither
his notes nor his syllables; as he delivers every tone with
perfect clearness and purity of sound, and every letter
with exact though delicate execution, in its articulation.
The faulty character of early education, however, in
very many instances, leaves the professional speaker
quite deficient in correct habit as to enunciation. Not a
few preachers are, in this respect, inaccurate and remiss,
to an extent which hinders their usefulness, and degrades
their address.
The same remark applies to the habitual accent and
pronunciation of many speakers in the pulpit, who, in-
stead of exhibiting the appropriate refinement of good

slovenliness.
The discipline of the vocal organs which is prescribed
by the art of elocution, while it would guard the speaker
against all such faults, would save him from the opposite
ones of finical nicety and affectation.*
Force and “Stress."
The cultivated speaker will be felt, in his power of
producing, on the requisite occasions, any effect of force
and volume of voice, - from the approach to whispering,
which extreme earnestness produces, to the full body of
tone thrown out in warm and powerful exclamations, re-
sembling, perhaps, the style even of a hearty shout or
piercing call. The thorough-going cultivation of the voice
will impart to every word uttered by the speaker its pe-
culiar modification of force, as regards the characteristic
commencement and termination of sounds expressive of
emotion.t His tones of command will be marked by the
boldness and decision with which the accented sound of
every emphatic word commences,—his tones of entreaty
by sounds commencing softly, but swelling out earnestly,
and afterwards diminishing : his utterance in the mood
of stern and determined resolve, will be marked, on the
contrary, by the abrupt explosive termination of charac-
teristic sounds ;ll and his tones of surprise will exhibit the

peculiar intensity of this emotion in its characteristic ten-

the closing of emphatic sounds :* his exclamations of em-
passioned excitement will be distinguished not merely by
vague and general loudness, or by an ordinary swell of
voice, but by a well-marked and highly characterized ut-
terance which lays an obvious stress on the beginning,
the middle, and the end of every emphatic sound. It is
thus that the language of emotion is rendered intelligible
by nature's distinct alphabet of sound being preserved
specifically to heart and ear, while the unpractised speak-

The discipline of the voice imparts to the practised
speaker an indescribable power over the feelings of his
audience, not merely by his command over every mood
and form of force by which the soul may be roused or
tranquillized, impelled or subdued, but not less by the
range which it gives to his voice over all the keys of ex-
pressive utterance, as high or low-pitched, lively or grave,
gay or sombre, brisk or solemn. The unpractised reader
or speaker has but little compass of utterance, and clings
to the same unvaried notes. The disciplined voice trav-
erses, with the utmost facility, and with electric effect,
from pole to pole of the scale of expressive tones, touches
every point with perfect precision and definite meaning,
and throws out, at pleasure, the most impressive effects
of contrast, whenever the sudden shifting of the current

of language and emotion, requires a marked transition of
vocal effect.
It is such reading only which can present the tones of
the heart, in the language of the Psalmist, as he passes
from the lowest depths of despondency and remorse, to
the highest strains of joy and praise. Many of the hymns
so commonly read with a dead level of voice, require
similar variations of utterance, to give anything like true
and soul-felt effect to the emotions which they were de-
signed to express. The habitual tones of many readers
of hymns, are so cold, so lifeless, and inexpressive, so
flatly prosaic and mechanical, that the whole style is vir-
tually a desecration of the sacred lyrics, which were com-
posed for the express purpose of breathing a higher and
purer life into the exercise of devotion. The miserable
defectiveness of education as it is, never appears more
striking than when the minister who has spent a large
part of life, the whole period from the commencement of
his academic career to the close of his professional course,
- in professed preparation for the right discharge of the
duties of the pulpit, “goes through the ceremony” of
reading a hymn, as if it were a page of an almanac, with
a perpetually returning clink of voice, that seems to re-
semble nothing so much as the never varying sound of
the hammer on the anvil.
No reader needs so complete a control over the pitch
and range of the voice as the preacher. The deepest
notes of profound awe, solemnity, and reverence, are in-
dispensable to his utterance, not as an occasional resort
for variety and effect, but as the prevalent strain of de-
vout expression, whether in the reading of the Scriptures
and of hymns, or in the appropriate effect of a sermon
which happens to exemplify, with more or less frequency,
the language of profound emotion. None but a practised
speaker can sustain long the peculiar organic action re-
quisite for the production of deep-toned utterance. It is,
of all modes of voice, the most exhausting to organs ac.

is analogous to that of a vocalist whose natural “register"
and habitual practice are " tenor," changing, for an hour,
”
to the exercise of singing “ bass.” The effect is usually
felt, in such cases, to be altogether enfeebling. Yet the
same individual will sustain, without fatigue, his wonted
form of vocal exertion, for a whole evening. The aver-
age voice of conversation and unempassioned reading or
speaking, is in the “ tenor” or middle range of notes ;
that of solemn and deep emotion, in public address, is
relatively as low as “bass." The latter is properly the
”
prevalent style of the pulpit, which demands the strong
and impressive utterance of passages naturally pitched
on a low key; while conversation, in consequence of the
limited space which it requires the voice sto fill, admits
the easier task of vocal exertion on a low pitch, united
with a softened force.
Persons conversant, to any extent, with the nature of
the process of “phonation,"* will at once perceive the
peculiar necessity of vocal training for the preacher, as it
arises from the special form of utterance connected with
his professional functions. Any ear, however, can readily
detect the helpless and inexpressive hollowness into
which the preacher's voice so often falls in the strains of
deep feeling, a fault against which due cultivation and
practice would be an infallible safeguard.
The dreaded reaction of nature, on Monday, after the
excessive exertions of the Sabbath, a thing which
preachers of delicate or susceptible organization so often
anticipate with a sense of coming misery, is, no doubt,
caused, in part, by the unreasonable extent of exertion
encountered in repeating the effort of public speaking
twice, or even thrice, on the same day. But the chief
cause of exhaustion is usually to be traced to the state of
the larynx and the bronchial tubes, induced by the fre-

quent repetition and long continued use of the lowest
notes of the voice, which of necessity cause the expendi-
ture of a comparatively large supply of breath, in their
production and formation.
A rigorous course of vocal exercise, serving, for the
organs of speech, the same purpose with powerful gym-
nastic discipline for the limbs, is the only security for the
long continued possession of strength of utterance, espe-
cially if exerted on low notes. The parts so severely
taxed must be protected by exercise adapted both to in-
durate and supple the muscular apparatus, so as to im-
part, at once, vigor and flexibility to the voice.
The unreflecting observer often contents himself, in
view of the professional difficulty now referred to, with
prescribing to the preacher the habitual use of a higher
key of voice, in his public performances, as a sufficient
security against injurious effects. But it is forgotten, in
these instances, that the preacher, if true to his office,
must habitually use the natural and proper tones of deep
and solemn emotion; and, although it is certain, that evils
not unfrequently arise from the undue prevalence of one
strain of feeling and of utterance, yet it is not less so,
that the very themes on which the preacher discourses,
require, for the most part, a deepened note of voice.
There is, in fact, no alternative, in most cases, but due
practice and training, as a security against those fatal
inroads of disability and disease, which are so frequent
among the members of the clerical profession. Powerful
constitutions and cheerful tempers enable individuals to
bear much injury without sinking under it. The cerebral
and nervous systems (not to speak of the muscular frame)
of some men, enable them even to bid defiance to the
effects of habitual intemperance, and to attain, in spite of
these, to a vigorous old age, as in the case of the Scot.

thority for indulging in such practices. The case is sim-
ilar, as regards the tear and wear of vocal exertion : if
not counteracted by rational preventives, it cuts off, si-
lently but surely, its annual multitudes of victims. The
seasonable precautions which a proper early education
would prescribe, might obviate all such evils. But, as
matters are, this result is left to the choice of the adult
student, at a stage when the remedy, if not speedily ap-
plied, may prove too late.
66
Inflection."
The systematic cultivation of the voice, is in no respect
more important to true and effective expression, than in
its proper inflection, or, in other words, its transits upward
and downward on the scale, in accommodation to the va-
riations of thought and feeling, whether in emphatic
words, or the successive clauses of a sentence. The ut-
terance of unpractised and unskilful readers, is usually
marked by the absence of inflection, and, consequently, a
prevailing monotony; or by mechanical inflections, which
never rise or fall beyond a certain note, and which neces-
sarily give a measured correspondence of parts to all sen-
tences, alike; gliding up at one clause and down at
another, in a regularly alternating see-saw of sound,
which destroys the natural variety of thought and emo-
tion. This uniformly recurring verbal melody, resembles,
in effect, the singing of all the hymns in a book to the
same tune. Another common fault in inflection, is that
of overdoing it; so that the upward and downward slides
are rendered mechanically and disagreeable prominent,
projecting themselves upon the ear, as the jagged rocks
of wild scenery upon the eye; or that of exaggerating
every inflection into a double form, comprising both slides
in every distinctive or emphatic accent. This style de-
stroys all repose and dignity of voice, by its jerking turns
and reduplications, and its over anxious emphasis. Anoth-

er error, still, converts all poetry into prose by substituting
the pointed and marked inflections of common discourse,
for the reduced and melodious ones of verse. This fault
seems to extract the appropriate feeling from a hymn,
and to bring it down from devotional elevation to mere
practical associations of utility, such as are appreciated
by the understanding, rather than felt in the heart. But
the most prevalent of all faults in inflection, is that of
varying the voice by a certain personal melody of tone,
habitual to the reader alone; sliding upward or downward
or waving and undulating, at the dictate of a false ear,
without any regard to the expression of thought or feeling,
and in obedience to no law but the accustomed gait of
the individual's peculiar style of utterance, contracted at
school. This fault constitutes what is termed, in popular
language, "a tone." It marks the man, but does not ex-
press his meaning. Its effect resembles that of singing
“out of tune,” and adding to false intonation a vitiated
melody. Whatever may be the sentiment which such a
speaker utters, its effect is neutralized, more or less, by
this trick of habit. Yet it is a fault from which few
speakers comparatively are exempt. Some exemplify it
more conspicuously; others, less so: but it is an error in
elocution which holds possession of the pulpit, to the ex-
clusion of the genuine expressive utterance that nature
prompts, and which alone can elicit a true personal sym-
pathy.
A degree of attention, no greater than is usually given,
in the cultivation of vocal music, to the mastering of the
gamut, would cure all the faults which usually disfigure
the inflections of pulpit elocution, and would enable the
preacher to speak with effect both to head and heart, in
the appropriate language of inflection. The simple and
.
complex* slides of the voice upward and downward on
the scale, are the only proper means of drawing intellec-

tual distinctions, of indicating the constituent and relative
parts of a sentiment, as these are subdivided and arranged
in the consecutive clauses of a sentence, or of conveying
those emotions which predominate in the heart of the
speaker, and which he wishes to transfer to those of his
audience.
"Inflection," whether it is exemplified in the form of
the “slide” or the “wave,” may be analyzed scientifi-
cally, in the manner exhibited in Dr. Rush's work on the
voice, by the application of the musical scale; or it may
be studied practically, by attentive observation of the
actual turns of voice, in the exercises of reading and
speaking. But, in either case, it requires a close and
penetrating application of the attention to nice and exact
distinctions of sound. It cannot be mastered by ordinary
inspection or transient notice. But the due study and
practice of this part of elocution will be richly rewarded,
in the acquisition of a skilful and effective control over
the true “melody" of speech and reading, and, conse-
quently, over that music of the voice which plays, at the
will of the orator, the tune of thought or that of feeling.
Inflections are, always, the vocal exposition of a sentence:
they are the interpreters of speech and enforce its mean-
ing; without them, reading is but the senseless syllabica-
tion of the juvenile learner, in his unpractised steps, when
the spirit of a passage is merged in the mere sound of
words as such. The voice of the skillful reader, aided
by appropriate inflections, strikes a thought home to both
head and heart, and awakes in the soul every kindred
association. Inflection is, in all cases, one of the most
Ilseful and effectual instruments of true eloquence. It is
the purest and most brilliant of all the ornaments which a
consummate elocution confers on the voice. It is the ap-
propriate language of a cultivated intellect and a discern-
a
ing spirit; and it is, not less distinctively, the melody into
which emotion breathes the life and power of expression.*

Movement."
Another distinguishing trait of a cultivated voice, and
one which is of the utmost moment to the preacher, is
the complete control which it ensures over the “ move-
ment,” or rate of time observed in utterance, as adapted
to different emotions. A slight observation is sufficient
to enable any ear to detect the common faults, in this
particular, which are exhibited in the pulpit. Some
preachers, desiring to secure a plain, familiar style of ex-
pression, resembling that of conversation, run into the
error of too great rapidity. A similar result is produced
by the constitutional vivacity of others. In either case,
dignity and impressiveness, and even distinctness, are,
more or less, sacrificed to impulse and velocity.
The audience which the minister of religion usually
addresses, is of a mixed character, as to intellectual dis-
cipline and ability, and is largely made up of persons
who are daily engaged in the practical pursuits of active
business. Minds addicted to habits of this description,
do not usually prove rapid in the formation of strictly in-
tellectual associations: they need a comparatively full
allowance of time to aid the development of a train of
thought. An audience formed of students and profes-
sional men, accustomed to facility and rapidity of mental
action, can more easily keep up with the succession of
ideas created by a reader whose gait of voice inclines to
velocity. The habit of silent reading enables the prac-
tised student to follow the succession of thought with the
utmost rapidity; and his discipline of intellect renders
him competent even to foresee a speaker's drift of thought,
and anticipate his train of argument. But the man of

merely operative and practical habit, must move deliber-
ately, and follow, rather than accompany, a speaker. The
aged hearer, who has little intellectual facility, often com-
plains of the preacher's rapidity and confusion of utter-
Complaints such as this, are not always well
grounded; and the waning faculties of age are, too often
in these cases, the chief source of apparent feebleness
and indistinctness in the voice of the preacher. No
speaker, however, who addresses a mixed audience,
should suffer himself to fall into the rapidity of utterance
which leaves any passage unintelligible to any individual
among his hearers.
Deliberateness of manner is not only an indispensable
requisite to intelligible address, but a powerful and natu-
ral aid to impressive utterance. Without a moderate rate
of "movement” in the voice, there can be no association
of grave or grand effect on the ear: the style of utterance
is, in such instances, unavoidably rendered light and tri-
vial. Solemnity, in particular, demands the utmost slow-
ness of utterance. The uncultivated reader is always
prone to celerity of enunciation, and thus hinders repose
and reverence, and every other form of deep and tranquil
impression. A style like this, is peculiarly ill-suited to
the purposes of reading and speaking, as connected with
the duties of the sacred office.
The cultivated reader is taught to appreciate the be-
coming effect and moral beauty of due slowness, as an
attribute of sacred eloquence. He gives, accordingly,
ample scope to sound, lengthens the duration of every
prominent vowel, and thus makes it the fit vehicle of
deep and full emotion: he avoids a crowded utterance as
the very bane of serious and grave feeling; he cultivates
the habit of moderation in the succession of sounds; and
his pauses all naturally receive a proportioned length, by
which they become deeply impressive to the ear. These
traits of utterance are indispensable to the majesty of
style prevalent in all the sublime descriptions of the Old

Testament, and are required, not unfrequently, in the
New.
But while taste and feeling demand due slowness in
uttering whatever is deeply impressive to the mind; they
forbid equally all lagging and drawling, as wholly destruc-
tive of every good effect, -as only irksome or ridiculous,
bespeaking a feeble temperament and habit, and an utter
inability to create any deep or powerful effect. This style,
however, is proverbially current in pulpit elocution, and
forms one of the distinctive and prominent features of its
mechanically solemn and exaggerated manner.
The dis-
cipline of elocution dispels such effects, by the light which
it sheds on the nature of “movement,” as an element of
vocal effect; and, just as the musician obeys, with in-
stinctive readiness, the direction which accelerates or re-
tards his voice, with the most definite precision, and vivid
effect on the ear, so does the instructed reader produce
the characteristic expression of every sentiment by the
instantaneous adaptation of his rate of utterance to the
spirit of the language which falls from his lips. Truth,
and nature, and propriety, preside, thus, over his whole
manner, and render it living and eloquent.
66
Rhythm" and Pausing.
The discipline of the voice offers to the public speaker
a great facility, as regards the proper vocal effect required
for his purposes, in the regularity of “rhythm," or the
equable succession of sound, and the due length of pauses.
“Rhythm," as a part of elocution, enables the reader to
maintain an equal and symmetrical flow of voice, while
it guards him, not less carefully, against a mechanical,
prominence of rhythmical accent, which is attended with
a hammering effect on the ear.
A true rhythm has been demonstrated by Steel to con-
stitute, as distinctly, a trait of appropriate reading and
speaking, as of music. It serves, in the former, the same

purposes as in the latter: it imparts a smooth, agreeable,
and symmetrical effect to the voice: it prescribes and
facilitates a regular and easy style of breathing: it ena-
bles the reader or speaker to pronounce the successive
clauses of every sentence with a regulated, easy, fluent
style of accent, which renders the effort of full utterance
comparatively light, promotes the tranquillity of his emo-
tions, saves his own organic strength, and gives forth his
language with an harmonious and pleasing effect to the
ear of others.
The uncultivated reader wastes breath and strength,
and disturbs his atterance, by want of regularity in the
alternate successions of sound and pause. His whole
style of voice is like that of a person who, in singing, pays
no regard to time,” - the
very foundation of music.*
-
Emphasis.
Nothing, perhaps, displays so strikingly the benefit of
systematic practice in elocution, as the force, the spirit,
and the efficacy which it imparts to emphasis.f The dull
routine of school reading, in its customary forms, deadens
the distinctive character of all prominent phrases, and re-
duces all the words of a sentence to one flat, monotonous
level, in which there are no projecting and salient points
to arrest the attention; the voice gliding on from begin-
ning to end of a period, as if every
clause were of exactly
equal weight, and every word of precisely the same sig.
nificance.
The influence of early habit is so strong with most per.
sons, that few, even among professional readers, seem to

voice which render a word significant or impressive.

have the power of throwing into a significant word, or an
expressive phrase, that force which an energetic and dis-
tinctive effect of sense or emotion demands. A proper
emphasis adds a heightened coloring of passion, or gives
a bolder prominence of meaning, to the most energetic
style, and is capable even of concealing the deficiencies
of expression comparatively tame. But most public read-
ers have accustomed themselves to a certain medium of
ordinary effect in emphasis, which forbids the possibility
of their imparting weight, or significance, or vivid force to
distinctive expressions. Hence their mode of reading is
so far from lending a powerful aid to written composition,
that it serves rather to weaken and impair it.
The actor who is distinguished in his art, studies his
emphasis with the most assiduous attention, and uses
every endeavor which professional ambition can prompt,
or professional skill can suggest, to give the most prom-
inent relief and the boldest effect to emphatic turns of
expression. He will sometimes devote successive hours
to the most laborious reïteration of vocal effort, to give
life and pungency to a single passage. Nor is this the
practice of mere drudges in their vocation, endeavoring
to work
ир dull conceptions to a vivid effect: it was the
daily self-discipline of men whose expressive genius the
world has always acknowledged and admired.
A disciplined voice may be recognized in its emphasis
as readily as in any other point, notwithstanding the cur-
rent notion that, to give a true emphasis, nothing more is
needed than a right understanding of the language which
requires it. Force and skill are, in this as in all otler
things, the fruit of practice. The violent blow of the
angry rustic may fall with little harm to him at whom it
is aimed: the skilful one of the scientific athlete, tells
with a direct and concentrated force, which renders it as
effective as it is inevitable. A similar result is exhibited
in the use of the voice, when the practised reader throws
into the emphasis of a single word a whole world of mean.

ing, condensed into one energetic sound; while the un-
skilful voice, with its vague loudness and aimless noise,
fights was one that beateth the air.”
The study of elocution not only prescribes this due dis-
cipline of the voice for positive force of emphasis, but for
that not less valuable means of impressive effect, the
power and the habit of withholding force, in anticipation
of emphasis or subsequently to its occurrence, so as to
give it the due relief arising from the comparative reduc-
tion of preceding and following words. In this mode of
managing the voice lies the main effect of expressive and
distinctive force. The unpractised reader is prone to fol-
low the negligent habit of conversational utterance, which
throws out a more frequent but a feebler emphasis than
impressive public reading demands. He is addicted, per-
haps, to those habits of false emphasis which lead him to
give unnecessary prominence to insignificant and inex-
pressive words, and, consequently, to mar the whole effect
of what emphasis he chiefly intends. He forces into em-
phatic style the auxiliaries and particles of a sentence, to
the utter subversion of meaning and cmotion.* The clo-
cutionary training of the voice in emphasis, leads to the
observance of a principle directly contrary to such prac-
tice, and accustoms the reader, by the use of a few obvi-
ous rules, to reserve his force for the prominent points of
meaning, and always to husband his emphasis so as to
make it tell.
Another very important effect of the due discipline of
the voice, as to emphasis, is the security which it gives
that the student shall avoid those sharp and jagged turns
of voice which indicate a species of nervous fastidious-
ness about emphasis. This fault was described, in a
preceding part of the present work, as an error of inflec-

tion, as well as emphasis, and as subverting all simplicity,
directness, and dignity of utterance. It can be effectually
cured in no way but by the faithful and rigorous analysis
of intonation and expression, which systematic elocution
prescribes. The gradations of inflection, in the slides
and waves of the voice, are all distinctly classified and
illustrated in the successive steps of elocutionary training
in this department; and to the practice of these, as laid
down in the manuals before mentioned, the student who
is desirous of attaining a correct and genuine emphasis,
is, for the present, referred.

· Expression.”
The discipline of the voice, in the expression of feeling
and emotion, is a part of elocution which, to the preacher,
is of vast moment. The imperfect utterance which char-
acterizes the ordinary style of reading formed at school,
the period when habit is generally fixed, - predisposes
even the clergyman, in the pulpit, to an inexpressive
mode of voice, which belies rather than manifests what-
ever emotion may exist in his soul. The voice of most
persons in adult life needs a thorough renovation of habit,
to enable it to utter truly the vivid language of the Scrip-
tures, of sacred poetry, or even of expressive prose. The
unfriendly influences of neglect and perversion of vocal
habit, in early years, and the equally unfavorable effect
of a conventional coldness of utterance, current in society,
have been frequently, in our preceding remarks, referred
to, as the sources of prevalent defects in reading and
speaking. Elocution, as a remedial art, offers to the stu-
dent the means and the methods of self-reformation in
expression. It prescribes an extensive and varied course
of practice on the most vivid passages of the most effec-
tive writers, with a view to awaken emotion and keep it
alive, in the exercise of reading. The materials for prac-
tice it draws largely from poetry, as the natural language

of feeling, and as the most inspiring source of empassion-
ed utterance. To the theological student, in particular, it
suggests the earnest reading of the Scriptures, - the most
vivid and the most poetic of all books, as one of the
most influential in imparting expressive character to the
habits of the voice. The reading of sacred poetry, espe-
cially in the lyric form, as the most inspiring of all, it pre-
scribes as another means of forming vocal habit to a true
and living style. It suggests, also, the frequent practice
of reading essays, lectures, and discourses in the form of
sermons, with a view to rendering the last of these modes
of exercise an easy and natural and habitual exertion, in-
stead of leaving it to prove an unattempted, unfamiliar,
and unnatural performance, inducing mechanical and ar-
tificial manner, and conscious awkwardness and embar-
rassment.
The preparatory discipline of elocution, by the famili-
arity which it produces with the genuine style of true
reading, brings this exercise to an identity with speaking,
in its manner and effect, and imparts to the varying tones
of emotion a distinctness and a force of character, which
make them pass with power from the heart of the reader
to that of the hearer. It thus takes off the coldness and
formality of the conventional style of sermonizing, and
substitutes for it that of actual personal communication
between man and man. It enjoins, accordingly, such a
frequency of repetition in the preparatory reading of a
discourse, as shall stamp the substance of it on the mind,
and enable the preacher to deliver it as virtually a spoken
address, rather than the school-boy reading of a prescribed
task. This frequency of repetition, in previous reading,
it requires, farther, to such an extent as shall leave the
preacher free to direct his eye, principally, to his audience
rather than his paper; as the language of the eye is na-
ture's primary effect in expression, whether as the means
of securing the attention and sympathy of those to whom
a discourse is addressed, or as the most efficacious mode

of securing, by reäctive effect on the reader himself, the
tones of genuine personal feeling in his voice.*
The study of elocution leads to a thorough-going anal-
ysis of all the component elements of expressive effect
of voice, and to an intimate knowledge of their character.
It provides an extensive course of practice on each singly,
and, also, in their combinations, till all can be executed
with unerring precision, fullness, and effect. The bad re-
sults of cold and inexpressive manner, have been already
described in this volume. On these, therefore, it is unpec-
essary at present, to dwell. The opposite style, of false,
excessive warmth, and of studied, artificial variety of in-
tonation, has also been described. The analysis which
practical elocution presents of all the constituents of vocal
expression, makes familiar to the student the exact char-
acter and value of each; so that he is secured against the
tendency, otherwise, to slight or exaggerate any. He be-
comes accustomed, accordingly, to observe closely the
proper effect of every point by which the expression of
emotion is naturally heightened or reduced: he acquires
an intuitive readiness and exactness of judgment, and a
critical refinement of taste, which guide him instinctively
to the vivid, full, and true utterance of every characteris-
tic tone of feeling. He preserves thus, the quiet, chaste,
.
unimpassioned, didáctic style of exposition and discus-
sion, in the essay, the lecture, and the doctrinal discourse;
while, in the treatment of subjects that naturally call forth
intensity of feeling, his utterance adapts itself, with no
less propriety and certainty of effect, to the language of
* Preachers, if they would observe how easy it is for an audience to
hold at arm's length the man who merely reads at them, (with his head
down, and his eye on his manuscript,) compared to the man who speaks
to them, (with the natural eloquence of his eye directed to theirs,) would
understand better how easy it is to listen with indifference to the one,
and how difficult to escape from the influence of the other. Prudence
might, in such cases, be excused for whispering the half-worldly sugges-
tion, how easy it may be, in given circumstances, to “dismiss” the one
and bow difficult to part with the other.

vivid emotion. His voice takes, in a word, the hue of
every subject over which it passes, and tinges his whole
utterance with the coloring of the heart. He knows how
to restrain expression, and how to give it free scope,
how
to call home the energy of the voice, and how to throw it
out. His extensive and varied discipline on expressive
tone, renders it easy for him to pass from the level and
tranquil moods of utterance to those which are imbued
with passion. His tones, therefore, spring directly from
feeling, and are as free from any arbitrary trait as they
are from morbid chill and reserve.
The diligent student of elocution recovers, in short, that
power of instantaneous sympathy and of vivid expression,
which characterized him at that early stage of life, when
the freshness and fullness of his tones indicated a heart
unmodified by conventional and arbitrary influence. The
power which he has thus recovered, his mature mind and
reflective judgment enable him to apply to those deeper
and richer sources of thought, which his intellectual cul-
ture has opened up to him. The still higher sphere of
thought and feeling to which the preacher's vocation
transfers him, he enters with a preparatory training, which,
if it does nothing else, frees him, at least, from the em-
barrassing consciousness that he has not acquitted him-
self fully and honorably, as far as human abilities may go,
to a part of the peculiar duties which are to be devolved
upon him, by his professional relation.

ELEMENTARY EXERCISES FOR THE VOICE.
The following exercises are designed for the practical
application of the principles discussed in the foregoing re-
marks: they consist, accordingly, of examples selected
with reference to those parts of elocution which are im-
mediately applicable to the training of the voice for the
purposes of the pulpit. To students who had already ac-
quired a knowledge of the general principles of elocution,
from the manuals formerly mentioned, or from any similar
source, the exercises now presented will suit the purpose
of special application to professional uses; and to persons
who had not previously made elocution a particular study,
they will serve as a partial substitute for a more extended
course of elementary discipline.

The elementary sounds and combinations contained in
the preceding tables, should be repeated till they can be
enunciated with perfect exactness and well-defined char-
acter, in the full style of public speaking.
Distinctness of enunciation will be much promoted by
a careful, slow, exact, syllabic and literal analysis of se-
lected words, read with special precision and force, for
the purpose of practising a clear, firm, well-marked artic-
ulation. This exercise is rendered still more conducive
to its intended effect, if lines or sentences are read in in-
verted order, so as to detach them from their ordinary
associations of sound.
A useful exercise for the purpose of securing a critical
knowledge of orthoëpy, and a strict accuracy of habit in
pronouncing, is to read aloud several columns, daily, from
Worcester's edition of Johnson and Walker's dictionaries,
as combined by Todd, and by Smart,* while close atten-
tion is paid to observe whether the sounds of the voice
correspond precisely to the notation of the orthoëpy.
A copious list of words commonly mispronounced, even
in the pulpit, formed a part in the original plan of the
present work. But the extent of the list rendered it im-
practicable to introduce it without swelling the size of the
volume beyond its limited extent. It may be sufficient,
perhaps, to refer here to the tables presented in the Elo-
cutionist, as a specimen of the classes of words which are
most liable to mispronunciation, and as an indication of
the importance of the exercise suggested in regard to the
use of the dictionary.
The pulpit, in our day, and in this country, is so gener-
ally regarded as the standard of accuracy in pronuncia-
tion, that more than usual attention to this branch of elo-
cution is justly required of ministers. But some young
preachers, in particular, are too prone to shrink from their

-
proper responsibleness as scholars, and to accommodate
their own style to mere popular usage, while others, from
a fastidious anxiety about bare exactness, adhere to the
letter of the law of nicety, and even transcend its require-
ments. Hence we hear, in some American pulpits, the
pronunciations - airth, maircy, pairfect, from speakers
who follow literally Walker's notation of orthoëpy, but do
not pay attention to his own qualification of it, The for-
mer class of errors, however, - that which arises from
accommodation to mere negligent common usage, - is
the more prevalent, and particularly in New England.
Hence the many broad and obsolete and peculiar sounds
which characterize the pulpit pronunciation of this region..
It would seem to be an axiom of education, that in an
extensive country like the United States, all young per-
sons should be everywhere trained to do their part in
preserving the unity of language and the refinement of
custom. A liberal education should enable every young
man to fill with propriety the office of public speaker, in
any part of his native country. But the fact is quite
otherwise. Our young New England clergy usually carry
with them their marked local peculiarities of usage in pro-
nouncing, and throw an unnecessary impediment in the
way of their own acceptance as speakers elsewhere. A
few months or years, it is true, usually suffice to rub off
such points. But a seasonable attention would prevent
their existence.
The pulpit orators of our Middle and Western States,
are very generally chargeable with gross negligence and
improprieties in pronunciation, which a little study in
early years would have sufficed to correct. The pulpit
cannot command the respect of any but the illiterate,
while it tolerates a slovenly inaccuracy and low taste, in
the use of language, or in the manner of pronouncing the
most ordinary forms of expression. The minister, as an
educated, or, at least, a reading man, should ever feel
that he is looked to as a model in this particular, and that

EXERCISES IN QUALITY.
“ Pure or Head Tone.''*
This quality of voice belongs to moderate, soft, and sub-
dued utterance, as in the expression of pathos, repose, and
solemnity, when not accompanied by grandeur or sublimity.
The object in view, in the practice of such passages as
the following, is, to secure the power of moulding the
voice into perfectly clear, pure, and smooth sound, as the
true and proper habit of utterance, but particnlarly impor-
tant in all passages of tender and softened effect. This
mode of voice characterizes the appropiate reading of
some of the Psalms, many of the most affecting hymns,
and all the subdued appeals of direct address, in dis-
courses from the pulpit. Pure head tone is of as much
service to the public reader and speaker as to the singer.
It renders the emission of vocal sound at once clear, easy,
natural, and agreeable, and enables the performer to ex-
ert his
organs
without fatigue.
The following, and all other exercises, should be re-
peated till a perfect vocal execution is attained. To
secure fully the quality in view, the “tonic" elements
should be repeated in the same style. The ear and the
voice will thus become perfectly attuned to the effect.

naturally inseparable from the upper “register," or range of notes ut-
tered by the human voice. This species of quality is the opposite to
“pectoral,” — the resonance of the chest, in the execution of the deep,
bass notes which form the lower "register.”

“Orotund Quality."*
This mode of voice is characterized by peculiar round-
ness, fullness, and resonance, combining the “purity” of
the “head tone” with the reverberation of the chest. It
has a deeper effect than mere purity of tone, and usually
ranges
with the
upper bass notes of the male voice; while
the head tone has a lighter character, and seldom extends
below the tenor level. Orotund quality is the natural
mode of utterance in all deep, powerful, and sublime emo-
tions. It belongs, accordingly, to oratory, and to the bolder
forms of poetry.
Orotund utterance is, like pure tone, a most effective
aid to easy and full voice. It serves to diminish the fa-
tigue of vocal exertion, and, at the same time, to give out
clear and agreeable sound: it renders the utmost force of
energetic utterance easily practicable; and, by throwing
vigor into the voice, it spares the lungs.
The remarks on frequency of practice in pure tone,
apply also to orotund quality. Every exercise should be
perfectly mastered before proceeding to another; and the
* The term “orotund” Dr. Rush has adopted from a modification of
the Latin phrase "ore rotundo.” The word, as was mentioned before, is
a good technical designation in elocution; as it not only intimates the
peculiar rotundity of the proper voice for public speaking, but the special
condition of the interior and back parts of the mouth, which its produc-
tion requires. As a “quality” of voice, it is the natural resonance of
notes of the middle and lower tenor and upper bass “register," when
uttered in a round, full, and bold style, with the glottis freely opened,
and all the circumjacent parts of the throat and mouth well expanded.
An ample “ laryngial” effect is thus produced: to this effect the techni-
cal term “orotund” is applied. See Orthophony.

The Treasures of the Deep. — Mrs. Hemans.

Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious Main ?
Pale glistening pearls, and rain-bow colored shells,
Bright things which gleam unrecked of, and in vain. -
Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy Sea!
We ask not such from thee.
" Yet more, the depths have more! What wealth untold
Far down, and shining through their stillness lies!
Thou hast the starry gems, the burning gold,
Won from ten thousand royal argosies.
Sweep o'er thy spoils, thou wild and wrathful main :
Earth claims not these again.
“ Yet more, the depths have more ! Thy waves have
rolled
Above the cities of a world gone by!
Sand hath filled up the palaces of old,
Sea-weed o'ergrown the halls of revelry! -
Dash o'er them, Ocean, in thy scornful play:
Man yields them to decay.
" Yet more, the billows and the depths have more:
Iligh hearts and brave are gathered to thy breast.
They hear not now the booming waters roar;
The battle thunders will not break their rest.

Joy and Sublimity.
Prophetic Anticipations. - Cowper.
"O scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,
Scenes of accomplished bliss; which who can see,
Though but in distant prospect, and not feel
His soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?
Rivers of gladness water all the earth,
And clothe all climes with beauty: the reproach
Of barrenness is past. The fruitful field
Laughs with abundance; and the land, once lean,
Or fertile only in its own disgrace,
Exults to see its thirsty curse repealed.
The various seasons woven into one,
And that one season an eternal spring:
The garden fears no blight, and needs no fence;
For there is none to covet, all are full.
The.lion, and the libbard, and the bear,
Graze with the fearless flocks; all bask at noon
Together, or all gambol in the shade
Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.
Antipathies are none. No foe to man
Lurks in the serpent now: the mother sees,
And smiles to see, her infant's playful hand
Stretched forth to dally with the crested worm,
To stroke its azure neck, or to receive
The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.
All creatures worship man, and all mankind
One Lord, one Father. Error has no place:
That creeping pestilence is driven away;
The breath of heaven has chased it. In the heart
No passion touches a discordant string;
But all is harmony and love. Disease
Is not: the pure and uncontaminated blood
Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.
One song employs all nations; and all cry,
Worthy the Lamb! for he was slain for us.'

*" A person who is possessed with an habitual good
intention, enters upon no single circumstance of life, with-

perpetual sense of the Divine presence, regards himself

ment nor the law has yet been able entirely to put an
end to this odious and abominable traffic. At the moment
when God, in his mercy, has blessed the world with a
universal peace,
there is reason to fear, that, to the dis-
grace of the Christian name and character, new efforts
are making for the extension of this trade, by subjects and
citizens of Christian States, in whose hearts no sentiment
of justice inhabits, and over whom neither the fear of
God nor the fear of man exercises a control. In the sight
of our law, the African slave trader is a pirate and a
felon; and in the sight of Heaven, an offender far beyond
the ordinary depth of human guilt. There is no brighter
part of our history, than that which records the measures
which have been adopted by the government, at an early
day, and at different times since, for the suppression of
this traffic; and I would call upon all the true sons of
New England, to coöperate with the laws of man and the
justice of Heaven.
“ If there be, within the extent of our knowledge or in-
fluence, any participation of this traffic, let us pledge our-
selves here, upon the Rock of Plymouth, to extirpate and
destroy it. It is not fit that the land of the pilgrims
should bear the shame longer. I hear the sound of the
hammer - I see the smoke of the furnaces where mana-
cles and fetters are still forged for human limbs. I see
the visages of those who, by stealth, and at midnight,
labor in this work of hell, foul and dark, as may become
the artificers of such instruments of misery and torture.
Let that spot be purified, or let it cease to be of New
England. Let it be purified, or let it be set aside from
the Christian world; let it be put out of the circle of hu-
man sympathies and human regards; and let civilized
man henceforth have no communion with it.

EXERCISES IN “STRESS."
“ Stress” may be briefly defined as the term used in
elocution to designate the mode and the place of forming
* This form of voice, although seldom exemplified in actual oratory,
unless in vehement address in the open air, is of immense value, as an
exercise for invigorating the organs and strengthening the voice, in oro-
tund quality. Its effects, when practiced a few times daily, for even a
few weeks, are such as to impart great volume and power of utterance
to persons who commence the exercise with weak organs and imperfect
tone.
† The effect of this exercise is to give compactness, and clearness,
and purity of tone, to the utmost extent of voice. The call, although
rising to a high note, with great loudness, should always be kept per-
fectly vocal or musical in its sound, resembling the easy, smooth effect
of the loudest singing, in its gradual and skilful swell. It is nothing
else than the maximum of “pure” or “ head tone."

STRESS.”
»
the maximum of force in a single sound. Thus, in the
appropriate utterance of some emotions, the force of the
voice bursts out suddenly, with a percussive explosion; as
in angry command, in which vocal sound is intended to
vent the passion of the speaker, and to startle and terrify
the hearer. An example occurs in the burst of fierceness
and wrath with which Death replies to Satan: “ Back to
thy punishment, false fugitive!” We may contrast with
this form of stress the gentle swell of reverence and adora-
tion, in the devotional language of Adam and Eve in their
morning hymn, in paradise: “ Hail! universal Lord !”
The utterance of the word “ Back,” in the former instance,
exemplifies “ explosive” “radical” (initial)“stress,” which
bursts out, with percussive abruptness, on the initial or
first part of the sound; that of the word “ Hail,” in the
latter, “median,” (middle,) as gently swelling out to its
maximum on the middle of the sound, whence it dimin-
ishes to the end or “vanish.” Another mode of stress,
termed "vanishing," — withholds the abrupt explosion
till the last particle (so to speak) of the empassioned
sound, and then throws it out with a wrenching and jerk-
ing violence on the very “vanish,” or last audible point of
voice. This form of stress occurs in the tones of ungov-
ernable impatience, deep, determined will, and excessive or
inconsolable grief. Of the first of these emotions we have
an example in the mad impatience of Queen Constance,
when protesting against the peace between France and
England, which was to sacrifice the rights of her son.
War! war! no peace! Peace is to me a war!” Of
the second we have an instance in the reply of the Swiss
deputy to Charles the Bold, when he is announcing to
the Duke the final determination of the cantons to resist,
to the last, the invasion of their rights. “ Sooner than
submit we will starve in the icy wastes of the glaciers !”
Of the third, in the Psalmist's exclamation, “My God!
my God! why hast thou forsaken me?”
A fourth mode of stress unites the “radical and the

vanishing” on the same syllable, by an abrupt jerk of
force on the first and last portions of the empassioned
sound. This is the natural expression of astonishment,
and is displayed with peculiar vividness, when the speak-
er reïterates the words of another person. An example
occurs in the exclamation of Queen Constance, when she
hears, for the first time, of the conditions of the peace
between France and England, and repeats the words of
the messenger.
Gone to be married! - gone to swear a
peace.”
A fifth form of stress, – peculiar to intense emotions,
throws out the voice, with the utmost force, on all the
points of a sound which admit of being rendered conspic-
uous or prominent, — the beginning, the middle, and the
end. This mode of utterance in emphatic syllables, is,
from its pervading effect, termed “thorough” stress. It
is exemplified in the shout of defiance, with which Fitz-
James addresses the band of Roderic Dhu,
“ Come one, come all! This rock shall fly
From its firm base as soon as I.”*

Hope. — Addison.
“No life is so happy as that which is full of hope, es-
pecially when the hope is well-grounded, and when the
object of it is of an exalted kind, and in its nature proper
to make the person happy, who enjoys it. This proposi-
tion must be self-evident to those who consider how few
are the present enjoyments of the most happy man, and
how insufficient to give him an entire satisfaction and
acquiescence in them.
†“ My next observation is this; that a religious life is
* The average level of the voice in public reading or speaking, - in
the form of lectures, practical and doctrinal discourses, and unempas-
sioned address, a pitch somewhat lower than the middle notes of con-
versation; as the former implies graver tone.
† The new. pitch with which every new paragraph properly com-
mences, is a point of the greatest moment in elocution, as deciding the
natural and appropriate style of reading, and distinguishing it from that
which is mechanical and unimpressive. True reading causes the para-
graphs of a piece. and the heads of a discourse, to indicate the change
which is taking place in the current and direction of the thought. Every
new topic, subordinate, as well as principal, requires a new shade of
voice, in pitch, as higher or lower than the average tone of the preced-
ing paragraph. The same remark applies to single sentences. The
common fault, derived from school habits, is to rise to a new and higher
pitch, at the beginning of every sentence or paragraph, and gradually
fall in the successive clauses or sentences. Correct reading varies the
pitch according to the connection existing between sentences, and com-
mences on the low note of the cadence of the preceding sentence or par-

that which most abounds in a well-grounded hope, and
such a one as is fixed on objects that are capable of mak-
ing us entirely happy. This hope, in a religious man, is
much more sure and certain than the hope of any tem-
poral blessing; as it is strengthened not only by reason
but by faith. It has, at the same time, its eye perpetu-
ally fixed on that state which implies, in the very notion
of it, the most full and the most complete happiness.
*“ Religious hope does not only bear up the mind, un-
der sufferings, but makes her rejoice in them, as they
may be the instruments of procuring her the great and
ultimate end of all her hope. Religious hope has like-
wise this advantage above any other kind of hope, that
it is able to revive the dying man, and to fill his mind not
only with comfort, but with rapture and transport. He
triumphs in his agonies, while the soul springs forward
with delight to the great object which she has always had
in view, and leaves the body with an expectation of be-
ing re-united to it in a glorious and joyful resurrection."

agraph, when the sense is continuous or analogous, but rises to a new
and a higher strain, only when there is a new, a distinct, or an opposite
thought in the new sentence or paragraph. On the other hand, a new
sentence or paragraph, opening with a graver mood of sentiment, be-
gins, properly, with a lower pitch than, perhaps, even the cadence of
the preceding context.
The opening of a new paragraph should, generally, be lower in pitch
than the strain of utterance in the preceding part of a discourse. But
when, as in the example to which the present note refers, the speaker
intimates, in the beginning of a paragraph, the plan or order of his dis-
course, the voice is higher in pitch, as well as slacker in force; so as to
keep the main subject of address distinct from the parenthetical allu-
sions to the speaker's train of thought for the time. The practical rule
of elocation, for the commencing pitch of paragraphs is, usually, Begin
anew; i. e., Slacken the force, lower the pitch, and retard the rate of
the voice. This rule is founded on the obvious principle that it is not
till progress has been made in a sentence or paragraph, that the new
impulse of thought is felt in the force, pitch, and movement of the voice.
* An example of the usual lower pitch of a new paragraph.

Grave Emotion.
Man is born to Trouble. — Finlayson.
“That no man can promise to himself perpetual exemp-
tion from suffering, is a truth obvious to daily observation.
Nay, amid the shiftings of the scene in which we are
placed, ,who can say that, for one hour, his happiness is
secure? The openings through which we may be as-
sąiled, are so numerous and unguarded, that the very
next moment may see some message of pain piercing the
bulwarks of our peace.
Our body may become the seat
of incurable disease. Our mind may become a prey to
unaccountable and imaginary fears. Our fortune may
sink in some of those revolutionary tempests which over-
whelm so often the treasures of the wealthy. Our honors
may wither on our brow, blasted by the slanderous breath
of an enemy.
Our friends may prove faithless in the
hour of need, or they may be separated from us forever.
Our children, the fondest hope of our hearts, may be torn
from us in their prime; or they may wound us still more
deeply by their undutifulness and misconduct.
Alas! my brother of the dust, in this uncertainty of
worldly blessings, where is the joy on earth, in which
thou canst repose thy confidence ? or what defence canst
thou rear against the inroads of adversity? Dost thou
hope that by rising to power, or by increasing thy goods,
thou wilt insure the continuance of thy comfort ? Vain
man! hast thou not seen that the loftiest mountain meets
first the lightnings of the sky, and that the spreading tree,
when loaded with the glories of its foliage and fruit, is
most easily broken by the fury of the blast? In this
manner, the children of this world, by multiplying their
stores and extending their connections, furnish a broader
mark to the arrows of misfortune, and with the greater
certainty suffer disappointment and sorrow.”

Sublime Emotion.
The Works and Attributes of God. Moodie.
“ All vast and unmeasurable objects are fitted to im-
press the soul with awe. The mountain which rises
above the neighboring hills, and hides its head in the sky,
- the sounding, unfathomed, boundless deep, — the ex-
panse of Heaven, where, above and around, no limit
checks the wandering eye; - these objects fill and ele-
vate the mind, — they produce a solemn frame of spirit,
which accords with the sentimeni of religion.
"From the contemplation of what is great and magnifi-
cent in nature, the soul rises to the Author of all. We
think of the time which preceded the birth of the uni-
verse, when no being existed but God alone. While
unnumbered systems arise in order before us, created by
his power, arranged by his wisdom, and filled with his
presence,
the earth and the sea, with all that they con-
tain, are hardly beheld amidst the immensity of his works.
In the boundless subject the soul is lost. It is he who
sitteth on the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants
thereof are as grasshoppers. He weigheth the mountains
in scales. He taketh up the isles as a very little thing.'
• Lord, what is man that thou art mindful of him!'
“ The face of nature is sometimes clothed with terror.
The tempest overturns the cedars of Lebanon, or dis-
closes the secrets of the deep. The pestilence wastes,
the lightning consumes, - the voice of the thunder is
heard on high. Let these appearances be connected
with the power of God. These are the awful ministers
of his kingdom. The Lord reigneth, let the people trem-
ble. Who would not fear thee, O King of nations! By,
the greatness of thy power thine enemies are constrained
to bow.'"

Pathetic Emotion.
Autumnal Meditation instructive lo the Aged. — Alison.
“ There is an eventide in human life, a season when
the eye becomes dim, and the strength decays, and when
the winter of age begins to shed upon the human head
its prophetic snow. It is the season of life to which au-
tumn is most analogous; and much it becomes, and much
it would profit you, to mark the instructions which the
season brings. The spring and the summer of your days
are gone, and with them, not only the joys they knew,
but many of the friends who gave them. You have en-
tered upon the autumn of your being; and whatever may
have been the profusion of your spring, or the warm in-
temperance of your summer, there is yet a season of
stillness and of solitude, which the benificence of Heaven
affords you, in which you may meditate upon the past
and the future, and prepare yourselves for the mighty
change which you are soon to undergo.
“ If it be thus you have the wisdom to use the decay-
ing season of nature, it brings with it consolations more
valuable than all the enjoyments of former days. In the
long retrospect of your journey, you have seen every day
the shades of the evening fall, and every year the clouds
of winter gather. But you have seen also, every succeed-
ing day, the morning arise in its brightness, and in every
succeeding year, the spring return to renovate the winter
of nature. It is now you may understand the magnificent
language of Heaven, --it mingles its voice with that of
revelation, — it summons you, in these hours when the
leaves fall, and the winter is gathering, to that evening
study which the mercy of Ileaven has provided in the
Book of salvation; and while the shadowy valley opens
which leads to the abode of death, it speaks of that Hand
which can comfort and can save, and which can conduct
to those 'green pastures, and those still waters,' where
there is an cternal spring for the children of God.”

Marathon and Athens. — Byron.
“ Where'er we tread, 't is haunted holy ground;
No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould !
But one vast realm of wonder spreads around;
And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:
Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,
Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.
“ Yet to the remnants of thy splendor past,
Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng;
Long shall the voyager, with the Ionian blast,
Hail the bright clime of battle and of song;
Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore;
Boast of the aged ! lesson of the young!
Which sages venerate and bards adore,
As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.

Where are thy men of might? thy grand in soul?

First in the race that led to Glory's goal, (were!

A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!
The warrior's weapon and the sophist's stole
Are sought in vain; and o'er each mouldering tower,
Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power.”

watch, with a pious satisfaction, over the growing pros-

that they are not lost to us forever. They are still our

ELEMENTARY EXERCISES. — “MOVEMENT.”
211
EXERCISES IN “MOVEMENT.”
►
The word “movement” has properly the same applica-
tíon in elocution as in music. It designates the rate of
utterance, as slow, fast, or moderate, and implies the
recognition of “time,” as an element of effect, in the mod.
ifications of the voice. Movement,” in elocution, has
not the strict gradations of music; and, in its applications
to reading and speaking in the pulpit, is usually limited
to the following degrees, — "slowest," "slow," "moder-
ate," " lively."
The first mentioned of these distinctions, is exemplified
in the style of awe and deep solemnity, which prevails in
the utterance of the profoundest emotions of the soul. It
occurs in many passages of the Old Testament, in which
the language is of a marked poetic character, as in the
book of Job, the Psalms, and portions of the prophetic
writings. It pervades, also, the peculiar style of the Book
of Revelation, in the New Testament. The “ slowest
movement” characterizes likewise the poetry of Milton
and of Young, and, sometimes, that of Cowper and of
Thomson. It belongs appropriately to the reading of
those hymns which describe the awful majesty of Jeho-
vah, and to those which embody the ideas of death, retri-
bution, and eternity. It is the peculiarly distinctive point
of style in funeral discourses.
The full command over the movement of the voice, is
an indispensable requisite to the proper effect of the ut-
terance of devotion, whether in the reading of psalms and
hymns, or in the act of prayer. The following exercises
should be frequently practised till the full solemnity of
the slowest enunciation is attained, in that prolonged,
though not drawling style, which gives ample scope and
majestic effect to every sound of the voice, and causes
every element of speech to succeed another in the most
impressive and deliberate style.

This style is exemplified in the ordinary forms of sol.

sentiment. It pervades the elocution of the more impres-
sive passages of Scripture, generally, of most hymns, and
of all discourses adapted to the excitement of profound
emotion.
The main object of practice in this mode of voice, is to
preserve it from a lagging, drawling, formal, or heavy
effect, on the one hand, and from a tone too dry and un-

So shalt thou rest; — and what if thou withdraw
Unheeded by the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure ? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glides away, the sons of men,
The youth, in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The bowed with age, the infant, in the smiles
And beauty of its innocent age cut off,
Shall, one by one, be gathered to thy side
By those who, in their turn, shall follow them.
“ So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams."

The graves of the strangers ! — what tales are told by
every undistinguished heap, - what eloquence in this
utter absence of epitaphs !” Here, we may suppose,
rests the weary old man, to whom, after many bitter shifts,
all bitterly disappointed, wandering and mendicancy had
become a trade. His snow-white head, which had suf-
fered the inclemency of many winters, was here, at last,
laid low forever. Here, also, the homeless youth, who
had trusted himself to the wide world in search of fortune,
was arrested in his wanderings; and whether his heart
was as light and buoyant as his purse, or weighed down
with many privations and disappointments, the end was
the same, – only, in the one case, a blight; in the other,
a bliss. The prodigal, who had wandered far, and fared
still worse and worse, at length returning, was here cut
short in his better purpose, far from those friends to whom
he looked forward as a consolation for all his wretched-
ness. Perhaps, when stretched in mortal sickness in a

even to hear of his death when it had taken place. Far
from every remembered scene, every remembered face,
he was doomed here to take his place amidst the noteless
dead, and be as if he had never been.
"Perhaps one of these graves contains the shipwrecked
mariner, hither transferred from the neighboring beach.
A cry was heard by night through the storm which dashed
the waves upon the rocky coast; deliverance was impos-
sible; and next morning, the only memorial of what had
taken place, was the lifeless body of a sailor, stretched on
the sand. No trace of name or kin; not even the name
of the vessel, was learned; but, no doubt, as the villagers
would remark in conveying him to the Strangers' Nook,
he left some heart to pine for his absence, some eyes to
mourn for him, if his loss should ever be ascertained.
There are few so desolate on earth as not to have one
friend or associate. There must either be a wife to be
widowed, or a child to be made an orphan, or a mother to
suffer her own not less grevious bereavement. Perhaps
the sole beloved object of some humble domestic circle,
whose incomings and outgoings were ever pleasant, is
here laid low; while neither can the bereaved learn aught
of the fate and final resting-place of their favorite, nor
can those who kindly, but without mourning, performed
his last offices, reach their ears with the intelligence,
grateful even in its pain, - of what had been done to his
remains · here the energies which had battled with the

waves in their hour of might, and the despair whose ex-
pression had been wasted upon the black tempest, are
all stilled into rest, and forgotten. The storm is done;
its work has been accomplished; and here lies the strange
mariner, where no storms shall ever again trouble him.”
“ To the other graves there was also some one to resort
afterwards, to lament the departure of those who lay be-
low. The spot was always cherished and marked by at
least one generation of kind ones; and, whether distin-
guished by a monument or not, there was always a greater
or less interval before the memory of the deceased en-
tirely perished from its place. Still, as each holy day
came round, and the living flocked to the house of prayer,
there was always some one to send kind eye aside
towards that litile mound, and be for a moment moved
with a pensive feeling, as the heart recalled a departed
parent, or child, or friend. But the graves of the stran-
gers! all regard was shut out from them as soon as the
sod had closed ever them. The decent few who had af.
fected mourning over the strangers, had no sooner turned
away, than they were at once forgotten. That ceremony
over, their kind had done with them forever. And so,
there they lie, distinguished from the rest only by the mel-
ancholy mark that they are themselves undistinguished
from each other; no eye to weep over them now or here-
after, and no regard whatsoever to be paid to them till
they stand forth, with their fellow-men, at the Great and
Final Day."

The Death of the Wicked. — Massillon.
“ The remembrance of the past, and the view of the
present, would be little to the expiring sinner: could he
confine himself to these, he would not be so completely
miserable; but the thoughts of a futurity convulse him
with horror and despair. That futurity, that incompre-
hensible region of darkness, which he now approaches, –

known land from which no traveller has ever returned,
where he knows not whom he shall find, nor what awaits
him; that futurity, that fathomless abyss, in which his
mind is lost and bewildered, and into which he must now
plunge, ignorant of his destiny; that futurity, that tomb,
that residence of horror, where he must now occupy his
place amongst the ashes and the carcasses of his ances-
tors; that futurity, that incomprehensible eternity, even
the aspect of which he cannot support; that futurity,-
in a word, that dreadful judgment, at which, before the
wrath of God, he must now appear, and render account
of a life, of which every moment almost has been occu-
pied by crimes.
Alas! while he only looked forward to this terrible
futurity at a distance, he made an infamous boast of not
dreading it; he continually demanded, with a tone of
blasphemy and derision, Who is returned from it? He
ridiculed the vulgar apprehensions, and piqued himself
upon his undaunted courage. But from the moment that
the hand of God is upon him; from the moment that
death approaches near, that the gates of eternity open to
receive him, and that he touches upon that terrible futu-
rity, against which he seemed so fortified — ah! he then
becomes either weak, trembling, dissolved in tears, rais-
ing up suppliant hands to heaven, or gloomy, silent, agi-
tated, revolving within himself the most dreadful thoughts,
and no longer expecting more consolation or mercy, from
his weak tears and lamentations, than from his frenzies
and despair."

Elevated Sentiment.
The Enlargement of our Intellectual Powers. - Savile.
“ From the right exercise of our intellectual powers
arises one of the chief sources of our happiness. The
light of the sun is not so pleasant to the eye as the light
of knowledge to the mind. The gratifications of sense
yield but a delusive charm, compared with the intellect-
ual joys of which we are susceptible. But these intel-
lectual joys, however refined, are at present much inter-
rupted. HIowever wide the extent of human knowledge,
however deep the researches of human wisdomn, still it
must be confessed, that, in this life, our faculties are ex-
ceedingly limited, and our views exceedingly confined.
Light, to us, is everywhere mixed with darkness. Wher-
ever we cast our eyes, or turn our thoughts, we are re-
minded of our ignorance, are liable to perpetual mistakes,
and often fall into them even in our wisest pursuits. But
when the day of immortality dawns, all this shall vanish;
the encurnbrance of flesh and blood shall no longer grieve
us, nor the thick shades of ignorance ever more surround
The happy spirit emancipated, and having left the
spoils of mortality behind it, shall be able to comprehend,
fully and at once, all the truths and objects which now
either come but very partially within, or entirely cscape,
its observation. Here we are only children, but in heav-
en we shall arrive at the manhood of our being; and
us.

therefore we justly infer, that the strength and manhood
of our intellectual powers then, will surpass, at least, as
much what they are now, as the reason and judgment of
a man exceed those of a child.
“ But liowever this may be, certain we are, that the
faculties with which we are at present blessed, and which
are essential to our nature, shall be to a wonderful degree
invigorated and improved. They shall be capable of
taking in far more copious views, and abundantly larger
emanations of God's excellence, nay, of tracing the hid-
den springs of his inysterious operations. - The volumes
of nature, of providence, and of redemption, shall be re-
vealed: all the records both of time and eternity shall be
opened and explained.
* We already know, in some measure, the charms of
novelty, and feel the delight which arises from the con-
templation of objects new, grand, and beautiful. Let us
imagine then, if we can, the pleasing sensations we shall
experience, the high transports we shall feel, when other
and unseen worlds shall be disclosed to our view, and all
the glories of the celestial paradise beam on our wonder-
ing eyes. — Such a felicity, even in prospect, enlarges the
.
mind, and fills it with emotions which, while it feels, it
cannot express.
“ That our intellectual powers, in a future state, shall
really be thus amazingly enlarged, is not a matter of mere
conjecture; it is what experience, and reason, and revela-
tion, lend their combined aid to confirm. Experience
teaches us, that activity is essential to mind, and neces-
sary to true enjoyment. Reason tells us, that the acqui-
sition of knowledge, particularly that which respects the
works and ways of the Most High, is the noblest exercise
in which the active powers of the mind can be employed,
and a source of the most refined enjoyment of which an
intellectual being is capable. And to confirm the dictates
of reason, revelation assures us, that ‘now we know only
in part; but that hereafter that which is in part shall be

Mercy. — Shakspeare.
“The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd,
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above the sceptered sway, —
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.”
Argument.
Reasons against Anger. - Holland.
“ However manly and vigorous anger may sometimes
be thought, as a defensive instinct, it is, in fact, but a
weak principle, compared with the sedate resolution of a
wise and virtuous man. The one is uniform and perma.
nent, like the strength of a person in perfect health; the
other, like a force which proceedeth from a fever, is vio-
lent for a time, but it soon leaves the mind more feeble
than before. To him, therefore, who is armed with a

proper firmness of soul, no degree of passion can be use-
ful in any respect. And to say it can ever be laudable
and virtuous, is indeed a very bold assertion. For the
most part, we blame it in others; and, though we are apt
to be indulgent enough to our own faults, we are often
ashamed of it even in ourselves. Hence, it is common
to hear men excusing themselves, and seriously declaring
they were not angry, when they gave unquestionable
proofs to the contrary.
“But do we not commend him who resents the injuries
done to a friend or innocent person! Yes, we commend
him; yet not for passion, but for that generosity and
friendship of which it is the evidence. For, let any one
impartially consider which of these characters he esteems
the better; his, who interests himself in the injuries of
his friend, and zealously defends him with perfect calm-
ness and serenity of temper; or his, who pursues the
same conduct under the influence of resentment.
“ If anger, then, is neither useful nor commendable, it
is certainly the part of wisdom to suppress it entirely.
We should rather confine it, you tell us, within certain
bounds. But how shall we ascertain the limits, to which
it may, and beyond which it ought not to pass ? When
we receive a manifest injury, it seems we may resent it,
provided we do it with moderation. When we suffer a
worse abuse, our anger, I suppose, may rise somewhat
higher. Now, as the degrees of injustice are infinite, if
our anger must always be proportioned to the occasion, it
may possibly proceed to the utmost extravagance. Sha!
we set bounds to our resentment, while we are yet calm ?
How can we be assured, that being once let loose, it will
not carry is beyond them? or shall we give passion the
reins, imagining we can resume them at pleasure, or trust-
ing it will tire or stop of itself, as soon as it has run to its
proper length,? As well might we think of giving laws
to a tempest; as well might we endeavor to run mad by
rule and method.

MOVEMENT.”
" In reality, it is much easier to keep ourselves free
from resentment, than to restrain it from going to excess,
when it has gained admission; for if reason, while her
strength is yet entire, is not able to preserve her domin.
ion, what can she do when her enemy has in part pre-
vailed, and weakened her force? To use the illustration
of an excellent author: we can prevent the beginnings of
some things, whose progress afterwards we cannot hinder.
We can forbear to cast ourselves down from a precipice:
but, if once we have taken the fatal leap, we must de-
scend, whether we will or not. Thus, the mind, if duly
cautious, may stand firm upon the rock of tranquility; but
if she rashly forsake the summit, she can scarcely recover
herself, but is hurried away downwards by her own pas-
sion, with increasing violence”

nimation
This modification of utterance belongs to all animated
composition, whether narrative, descriptive, or didactic.
It implies vivid emotion or sentiment, as the prompting
cause of a quicker movement of voice, than belongs to
merely moderate feeling and expression. The frequent
practice of the subjoined examples, will serve to impart
animation to the voice, in appropriate passages. The
error to be guarded against, in these exercises, is that of
not coming fully up to the standard of animated move-
ment, as regards its liveliness and brisk effect. A com-
mon fault which deadens the character of utterance, is
that of using “median instead of “radical stress,” in
conjunction with the proper acceleration of movement.
The pungent and piercing effect of awakening and kind-
ling emotion, is thus lost to the ear. The proper union
of lively movement and radical stress, has the pointed
effect of what are termed “staccato” notes, in music,
or that of the distinct touch of the harp, compared to the
gliding sound produced by the bow on the violin.

Christian Courage. — Moodie.
“ The heathen, unsupported by those prospects which
the Gospel opens, might be supposed to have sunk under
every trial; yet, even among them, was sometimes dis-
played an exalted virtue, - a virtue, which no interest,
-
no danger, could shake; a virtue, which could triumph
amidst tortures and death, -a virtue, which, rather than
forfeit its conscious integrity, could be content to resign
its consciousness forever. And shall not the Christian
blush to repine? the Christian from before whom the veil
is removed ? to whose eyes are revealed the glories of
heaven?
“ Your indulgent Ruler doth not call you to run in vain,
or to labor in vain. — Every difficulty, and every trial,

he hath taught you to aspire. By every hardship which

The Happiness of those who have extended Human Knowledge. -
Brougham.
“ The more widely knowledge is spread, the more will
they be prized whose happy lot it is to extend its bounds
by discovering new truths, or multiply its uses by invent-
ing new modes of applying it in practice. Their numbers
will, indeed, be increased. But the order of discoverers
and inventors will still be a select few; and the only ma-
terial variation in their proportion to the bulk of mankind,
will be, that the mass of the ignorant multitude being
progressively diminished, the body of those will be incal-
culably increased, who are worthy to admire genius, and
able to bestow upon its possessors an immortal fame.
And if the benefactors of mankind, when they rest
from their pious labors, shall be permitted to enjoy here-
after, as an appropriate reward of their virtue, the privi-
lege of looking down upon the blessings with which their
toils and sufferings have clothed the scene of their former
existence; do not vainly imagine that, in a state of ex-
alted purity and wisdom, the founders of mighty dynas-
ties, the conquerors of new empires, or the more vulgar
crowd of evil-doers, who have sacrificed to their own ag-

Vivid Personification.
Happiness. -- Colton.
“She is deceitful as the calm that precedes the hurri-
cane, smooth as the water on the verge of the cataract,
and beautiful as the rainbow, that smiling daughter of the
storm; but, like the mirage in the desert, she tantalizes
ns with a delusion that distance creates, and that contigu-
ity destroys. Yet, when unsought, she is often found,
and when unexpected, often obtained; while those who
seek for her the most diligently, fail the most, because
they seek her where she is not. Anthony sought her in
love; Brutus, in glory; Caesar, in dominion ; the first
found disgrace, the second disgust, the last ingratitude,
and each destruction. To some she is more kind, but not
less cruel; she hands the:n her cup; and they drink even
to stupefaction, until they doubt whether they are men,
withi Philip, or dream that they are gods, with Alexander.
On some she smiles, as on Napoleon, with an aspect
more bewitching than an Italian sun; but it is only to
make her frown the more terrible, and by one short caress
to embitter the pangs of separation. Yet is she, by uni-
versal homage and consent, a queen; and the passions
are the vassal lords that crowd her court, await her man-

sovereigns, she is so surrounded by her envoys, her offi-
cers, and her ministers of state, that it is extremely dif-
ficult to be admitted to her presence chamber, or to have
any immediate communication with herself. Ambition,
Avarice, Love, Revenge, all these seek her, and her
alone; alas! they are neither presented to her, nor will
she come to them. She despatches, however, her envoys
unto them, mean and poor representatives of their
queen. To Ambition, she sends Power; to Avarice,
Wealth; to Love, Jealousy; to Revenge, Remorse : alas!
what are these, but so many other names for vexation or
disappointment? Neither is she to be won by flatteries
or by bribes: she is to be gained by waging war against
her enemies, much sooner than by paying any particular
court to herself. Those that conquer her adversaries,
will find that they need not go to her, for she will come
unto them. None bid so high for her as kings; few are
more willing, none more able, to purchase her alliance at
the fullest price. But she has no more respect for kings
than for their subjects; she mocks them, indeed, with the
empty show of a visit, by sending to their palaces all her
equipage, her pomp, and her train; but she comes not
herself. What detains her? She is travelling incognita
to keep a private appointment with Contentment, and to
partake of a dinner of herbs in a cottage."

hand to help them out of it, they will take up
with a pun,
and ride home upon a horse laugh: if they cannot keep
their ground, they will not wait to be ałtacked and driven
out of it. Whilst a reasoning man will be picking his
way out of a dilemma, they, who never reason at all,
jump over it, and land themselves at once upon new
ground, where they take an imposing attitude, and escape
pursuit. Whatever these men do, whether they talk, or
write, or act, it is without deliberation, without consis-
tency, without plan. Having no expanse of mind, they
can comprehend only in part; they will promise an epic
poem, and produce an epigram. In short they glitter, pass
away, and are forgotten; their outset makes a show of
mighty things; they stray out of their course into byways
and obliquities; and, when out of sight of their contem-
poraries, are forever lost to posterity.”
EXERCISES IN “RHYTHM." *
“ Rhythm” is, in elocution, the result of that regular and sym-
metrical movement of the voice, which is caused by the compara-
tively measured style of rhetorical composition. It implies, also, a
just observance of those pauses, whether marked in the punctuation
or not, which the sense of a passage demands; and these pauses
thus become, like rests in music, portions of the measure and rhythm
It is this last mentioned effect which renders rhythm so important
to an easy, fluer., and natural use of the voice, in reading and
speaking; suggesting the practice of frequent, slight, but well-timed
breathing, instead of the common faulty mode cî drawing breath at
distant and irregular intervals, and with painful effort. The former
of these habits renders public reading and speaking easy, even to
persons of feeble health; the latter wears away the organic strength
of the most vigorous. The former mode preserves the smooth, even
* The word “ rhythm” is used, in elocution, to designate that regu-
lated movement of voice, which exists, in its fully marked form, in the
combined effect of the metre and pauses of verse, but which belongs, in
degree, to all well-written and well-spoken language, in prose, – in the
forms, particularly, of declamation and discourse.

RHYTHM."
flow of voice; the latter breaks the continuity both of sound' and
sense.
Rhythm is, in detail, the regular recurrence of accent, at definite
and measured intervals, and may be beat and marked as strictly as
in music, if attention is paid to the suspensions of sound by pauses,
so as to include them, as well as the actual sounds of the voice, be-
tween the beats, as in the bars of music. Every accented syllable
is, in elocution, equivalent to the beginning of a bar in music, and
may be so marked; thus, | Muse | music | musical | un- | musical I;
.
or, if read with pauses | Muse , | or 77 ) music |, | or |
musical |, | or 771 Yun- | musical | .*
The subjoined exercises should be practised with the aid, at first,
of beating time at the commencement of every bar, as in music.
The rhythm should be, for some time, marked quite strongly with
the voice; the beat and the decided marking may be gradually laid
aside, as the ear becomes competent to direct itself. But the actual
time should never cease to be carefully observed in reading, speak-
ing, and reciting, any more than in music itself. The fact, however,
should never be forgotten, that an habitual strong marking of rhythm,
is the same fault in elocution as in music. It protrudes what should
be a barely perceptible property, and turns an excellence into a
defect. A delicate marking of rhythm, is a genuine grace of culti-
vated elocution, in the reading of verse, and in the language of ora-
tory or of sentiment. The great object of practice, as regards
time,” is truth, not force.
The student of elocution would do well to score numerous pas-
sages, for himself, in the manner exemplified as follows.

* Every accented monosyllable, in elocutionary rhythm, constitutes a
bar; all the unaccented syllables, in a polysyllable, are grouped in th
same bar, with the accented syllable, or pause preceding. The rule
marking is simply, Place a bar before every accented syllable, where
found, and before every pause. — One or more unaccented syllables ar.
sometimes grouped into the same bar with a pause. For the conven-
ience of marking, a bar is assumed as composed of one quarter or two
cighth notes.
Half or secondary accents, wherever they occur, commence a new
bar; thus, the syllable mans, in the word | manifes. | tation, or the sylla-
in the word in- | contro- | vertible.

* From the analysis which has been given of rhythm, in conjunction
with metrical accent in its principal forms, it may be perceived that, in
reading, the prosodial grouping of syllables is subordinate — not pre-
dominant - in the audible effect. The common fault in reading verse
is caused by inverting this rule; and, when to this defect is added that
of omitting the rhythmical pauses, nothing is left to the ear but the
mere jingle of the scanning.

EXERCISES IN EMPHASIS.
Emphasis, as properly defined by Dr. Rush, in his Phi-
losophy of the Voice, and, indeed, as is implied in the
very etymology of the term, is not a mere comparative
force of accent only, but a concentration of several or of
many expressive elements of vocal sound, upon one ele-
ment or syllable. The comparative force does, no doubt,
exist; but its use is to embody and impress the effect of
the rest. Thus, if we select, as an example, the reply of
Death to Satan, “ Back to thy punishment! false fugitive,”
.
we shall find that the first of the emphatic words, while

sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph, and even to the
long quadruple pause which follows the close of a piece or discourse.
One of the faults in elocution by which the pulpit is sometimes degraded,
is the business-like dispatch with which the minister passes from the
la t word of his sermon to the formula that follows: — as if his purpose
were to obliterate, as quickly as possible, the effect of his discourse.-
Paragraph pauses are usually double the length of those of periods.
Double paragraph pauses are the proper distinctions of the heads of
diseoursc; and these ought to be doubled, if referred to as a definite
measure for the pause which should follow an entire discourse.

“explosive” utterance and “radical stress," from " aspi-

" falling inflection," or "downward slide,” and “rapid

or even any one of these properties, the exclamation

had trusted himself to the wide world in search of fortune,
was arrested in his wanderings; and whether his heart
was as light and buoyant as his purse, or weighed down
with many privations and disappointments, the end was
the same, - only, in the one case, a blight; in the other,

a
gers, his mind wandered in repentant fondness to that
mother whom he had parted with in scorn, but for whose
hand to present his cup, and whose eye to melt him with
its tenderness, he would now gladly give the miserable
remains of his life. Perhaps he thought of a brother, also
i parted with in rage and distrust, but who, in their early
years, had played with him, a fond and innocent child,
over the summer leas, and to whom that recollection for-
gave everything. No one of these friends to soothe the
last moments of his wayward and unhappy life — scarcely
even to hear of his death when it had taken place. Far
from every remembered scene, every remembered face,
he was doomed here to take his place amidst the noteless
dead, and be as if he had never been.
"Perhaps one of these graves contains the shipwrecked
mariner, hither transferred from the neighboring beach.
A cry was heard by night through the storm which dashed
the waves upon the rocky coast; deliverance was impos-
sible; and next morning, the only memorial of what had
taken place, was the lifeless body of a sailor, stretched on
the sand. No trace of name or kin; not even the name
of the vessel, was learned; but, no doubt, as the villagers
would remark in conveying him to the Strangers' Nook,
he left some heart to pine for his absence, some eyes to
mourn for him, if his loss should ever be ascertained.
There are few so desolate on earth as not to have one
friend or associate. There must either be a wife to be
widowed, or a child to be made an orphan, or a mother to
suffer her own not less grevious bereavement. Perhaps
the sole beloved object of some humble domestic circle,
whose incomings and outgoings were ever pleasant, is
here laid low; while neither can the bereaved learn aught
of the fate and final resting-place of their favorite, nor
can those who kindly, but without mourning, performed
his last offices, reach their ears with the intelligence,
grateful even in its pain, – of what had been done to his
remains : here the energies which had battled with the

pression had been wasted upon the black tempest, ure
all stilled into rest, and forgotten. The storm is done;
its work has been accomplished; and here lies the strange
mariner, where no storms shall ever again trouble him.”
“ To the other graves there was also some one to resort
afterwards, to lament the departure of those who lay be-
low. The spot was always cherished and marked by at
least one generation of kind ones; and, whether distin-
guished by a monument or not, there was always a greater
or less interval before the memory of the deceased en-
tirely perished from its place. Still, as each holy day
came round, and the living flocked to the house of prayer,
there was always some one to send a kind eye aside
towards that litile mound, and be for a moment moved
with a pensive feeling, as the heart recalled a departed
parent, or child, or friend. But the graves of the stran-
gers! all regard was shut out from them as soon as the
sod had closed ever them. The decent few who had af-
fected mourning over the strangers, had no sooner turned
away, than they were at once forgotten. That ceremony
over, their kind had done with them forever. And so.
there they lie, distinguished from the rest only by the mel-

Final Day."

The Death of the Wicked.- - Massillon.

present, would be little to the expiring sinner: could he
confine himself to these, he would not be so completely
miserable; but the thoughts of a futurity convulse him
with horror and despair. That futurity, that incompre-

known land from which no traveller has ever returned,
where he knows not whom he shall find, nor what awaits
him; that futurity, that fathomless abyss, in which his
mind is lost and bewildered, and into which he must now
plunge, ignorant of his destiny; that futurity, that tomb,
that residence of horror, where he must now occupy his
place amongst the ashes and the carcasses of his ances-
tors; that futurity, that incomprehensible eternity, even
the aspect of which he cannot support; that futurity,
in a word, that dreadful judgment, at which, before the
wrath of God, he must now appear, and render account
of a life, of which every moment almost has been occu-
pied by crimes.
“ Alas! while he only looked forward to this terrible
futurity at a distance, he made an infamous boast of not
dreading it; he continually demanded, with a tone of
blasphemy and derision, Who is returned from it? Ho
ridiculed the vulgar apprehensions, and piqued himself
upon his undaunted courage. But from the moment that
the hand of God is upon him; from the moment that
death approaches near, that the gates of eternity open to
receive him, and that he touches upon that terrible futu-
rity, against which he seemed so fortified — ah! he then
becomes either weak, trembling, dissolved in tears, rais-
ing up suppliant hands to heaven, or gloomy, silent, agi-

and no longer expecting more consolation or mercy, from
his weak tears and lamentations, than from his frenzies

Elevated Sentiment.
The Enlargement of our Intellectual Powers. Savile.
“From the right exercise of our intellectual powers
arises one of the chief sources of our happiness. The
light of the sun is not so pleasant to the eye as the light
of knowledge to the mind. The gratifications of sense
yield but a delusive charm, compared with the intellect-
ual joys of which we are susceptible. But these intel-
lectual joys, however refined, are at present much inter-
rupted. However wide the extent of human knowledge,
however deep the researches of human wisdomn, still it
must be confessed, that, in this life, our faculties are ex-
ceedingly limited, and our views exceedingly confined.
Light, to us, is everywhere mixed with darkness. Wher-
ever we cast our eyes, or turn our thoughts, we are re-
minded of our ignorance, are liable to perpetual mistakes,
and often fall into them even in our wisest pursuits. But
when the day of immortality dawns, all this shall vanish;
the encurnbrance of flesh and blood shall no longer grieve
us, nor the thick shades of ignorance ever more surround
The happy spirit emancipated, and having left the
spoils of mortality behind it, shall be able to comprehend,
fully and at once, all the truths and objects which now
either come but very partially within, or entirely cscape,
its observation. Here we are only children, but in heav.
en we shall arrive at the manhood of our being; and
us.

therefore we justly infer, that the strength and manhood
of our intellectual powers then, will surpass, at least, as
much what they are now, as the reason and judgment of
a man exceed those of a child.
But lowever this may be, certain we are, that the
faculties with which we are at present blessed, and which
are essential to our nature, shall be to a wonderful degree
invigorated and improved. They shall be capable of
taking in far more copious views, and abundantly larger
emanations of God's excellence, nay, of tracing the hid-
den springs of his mysterious operations. — The volumes
of nature, of providence, and of redemption, shall be re-
vealed: all the records both of time and eternity shall be
opened and explained.
We already know, in some measure, the charms of
novelty, and feel the delight which arises from the con-
templation of objects new, grand, and beantiful. Let us
imagine then, if we can, the pleasing sensations we shall
experience, the high transports we shall feel, when other
and unseen worlds shall be disclosed to our view, and all
the glories of the celestial paradise beam on our wonder-
ing eyes.
Such a felicity, even in prospect, enlarges the
mind, and fills it with emotions which, while it feels, it
cannot express.
“ That our intellectual powers, in a future state, shall
really be thus amazingly enlarged, is not a matter of mere
conjecture; it is what experience, and reason, and revela-
tion, lend their combined aid to confirm. Experience
teaches us, that activity is essential to mind, and neces-
sary to true enjoyment. Reason tells us, that the acqui-
sition of knowledge, particularly that which respects the
works and ways of the Most High, is the noblest exercise
in which the active powers of the mind can be employed,
and a source of the most refined enjoyment of which an
intellectual being is capable. And to confirm the dictates
of reason, revelation assures us, that “now we know only
in part; but that hereafter that which is in part shall be

most amazing exaltation! While the men of the world

traces of infinite beauty, the impressions of celestial maj-

Mercy. — Shakspeare.
“ The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd,
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above the sceptered sway,
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.”
Argument.
Reasons against Anger. — Holland.
“However manly and vigorous anger may sometimes
be thought, as a defensive instinct, it is, in fact, but a
weak principle, compared with the sedate resolution of a
wise and virtuous man. The one is uniform and perma.
nent, like the strength of a person in perfect health; the
other, like a force which proceedeth from a fever, is vio-
lent for a time, but it soon leaves the mind more feeble
than before. To him, therefore, who is armed with a

proper firmness of soul, no degree of passion can be use.
ful in any respect. And to say it can ever be laudable
and virtuous, is indeed a very bold assertion. For the
most part, we blame it in others; and, though we are apt
to be indulgent enough to our own faults, we are often
ashamed of it even in ourselves. Hence, it is common
to hear men excusing themselves, and seriously declaring
they were not angry, when they gave unquestionable
proofs to the contrary.
“But do we not commend him who resents the injuries
done to a friend or innocent person! Yes, we commend
him; yet not for passion, but for that generosity and
friendship of which it is the evidence. For, let any one
impartially consider which of these characters he esteems
the better; — his, who interests himself in the injuries of
his friend, and zealously defends him with perfect calm-
ness and serenity of temper; or his, who pursues the
same conduct under the influence of resentment.
“ If anger, then, is neither useful nor commendable, it
is certainly the part of wisdom to suppress it entirely.
We should rather confine it, you tell us, within certain
bounds. But how shall we ascertain the limits, to which
it may, and beyond which it ought not to pass ? When
we receive a manifest injury, it seems we may resent it,
provided we do it with moderation. When we suffer a
worse abuse, our anger, I suppose, may rise somewhat
higher. Now, as the degrees of injustice are infinite, if
our anger must always be proportioned to the occasion, it
may possibly proceed to the utmost extravagance. Sha!
we set bounds to our resentment, while we are yet calm ?
How can we be assured, that being once let loose, it will
not carry is beyond them? or shall we give passion the
reins, imagining we can resume them at pleasure, or trust-
ing it will tire or stop of itself, as soon as it has run to its
proper length? As well might we think of giving laws
to a tempest; as well might we endeavor to run mad by
rule and method.

“ In reality, it is much easier to keep ourselves free
from resentment, than to restrain it from going to excess,
when it has gained admission; for if reason, while her
strength is yet entire, is not able to preserve her domin-
ion, what can she do when her enemy has in part pre-
vailed, and weakened her force? To use the illustration
of an excellent author: we can prevent the beginnings of
some things, whose progress afterwards we cannot hinder.
We can forbear to cast ourselves down from a precipice:
but, if once we have taken the fatal leap, we must de-
scend, whether we will or not. Thus, the mind, if duly
cautious, may stand firm upon the rock of tranquility; but
if she rashly forsake the summit, she can scarcely recover
herself, but is hurried away downwards by her own pas-
sion, with increasing violence"

"Lively Movement." "
This modification of utterance belongs to all animated
composition, whether narrative, descriptive, or didactic.
It implies vivid emotion or sentiment, as the prompting
cause of a quicker movement of voice, than belongs to
merely moderate feeling and expression. The frequent
practice of the subjoined examples, will serve to impart
animation to the voice, in appropriate passages. The
error to be guarded against, in these exercises, is that of
not coming fully up to the standard of animated move-
ment, as regards its liveliness and brisk effect. A com-
mon fault which deadens the character of utterance, is
that of using “median” instead of “radical stress,” in
conjunction with the proper acceleration of movement.
The pungent and piercing effect of awakening and kind-
ling emotion, is thus lost to the ear. The proper union
of lively movement and radical stress, has the pointed
effect of what are termed “staccato” notes, in music,
or that of the distinct touch of the harp, compared to the
gliding sound produced by the bow on the violin.

no danger, could shake; a virtue, which could triumph
amidst tortures and death, virtue, which, rather than
forfeit its conscious integrity, could be content to resign
its consciousness forever. And shall not the Christian

is removed ? to whose eyes are revealed the glories of
heaven?

The Happiness of those who have extended Human Knowledge.-
Brougham.
“ The more widely knowledge is spread, the more will
they be prized whose happy lot it is to extend its bounds
by discovering new truths, or multiply its uses by invent-
ing new modes of applying it in practice. Their numbers
will, indeed, be increased. But the order of discoverers
and inventors will still be a select few; and the only ma-
terial variation in their proportion to the bulk of mankind,
will be, that the mass of the ignorant multitude being
progressively diminished, the body of those will be incal-
culably increased, who are worthy to admire genius, and
able to bestow upon its possessors an immortal fame.
And if the benefactors of mankind, when they rest
from their pious labors, shall be permitted to enjoy here-
after, as an appropriate reward of their virtue, the privi-
lege of looking down upon the blessings with which their
toils and sufferings have clothed the scene of their former
existence; do not vainly imagine that, in a state of ex-
alted purity and wisdom, the founders of mighty dynas-
ties, the conquerors of new empires, or the more vulgar
crowd of evil-doers, who have sacrificed to their own ag-

“ She is deceitful as the calm that precedes the hurri-
cane, smooth as the water on the verge of the cataract,
and beautiful as the rainbow, that smiling daughter of the
storm; but, like the mirage in the desert, she tantalizes
ns with a delusion that distance creates, and that contigu-
ity destroys. Yet, when unsought, she is often found,
and when unexpected, often obtained; while those who
seek for her the most diligently, fail the most, because
they seek her where she is not. Anthony sought her in
love; Brutus, in glory; Caesar, in dominion ; — the first
found disgrace, the second disgust, the last ingratitude,
and each destruction. To some she is more kind, but not
less cruel; she hands the:n her cup; and they drink even
to stupefaction, until they doubt whether they are men,
wit'i Philip, or dream that they are gods, with Alexander.
On some she smiles, as on Napoleon, with an aspect
more bewitching than an Italian sun; but it is only to
make her frown the more terrible, and by one short caress
to embitter the pangs of separation. Yet is she, by uni-

sovereigns, she is so surrounded by her envoys, her offi-
cers, and her ministers of state, that it is extremely dif-
ficult to be admitted to her presence chamber, or to have
any immediate communication with herself. Ambition,
Avarice, Love, Revenge, all these seek her, and her
alone ; alas! they are neither presented to her, nor will
she come to them. She despatches, however, her envoys
unto them, - mean and poor representatives of their
queen. To Ambition, she sends Power; to Avarice,
Wealth; to Love, Jealousy; to Revenge, Remorse : alas!
what are these, but so many other names for vexation or
disappointment? Neither is she to be won by flatteries
or by bribes: she is to be gained by waging war against
her enemies, much sooner than by paying any particular
court to herself. Those that conquer her adversaries,
will find that they need not go to her, for she will come
unto them. None bid so high for her as kings; few are
more willing, none more able, to purchase her alliance at
the fullest price. But she has no more respect for kings
than for their subjects; she mocks them, indeed, with the
empty show of a visit, by sending to their palaces all her
equipage, her pomp, and her train; but she comes not

“Rhythm" is, in elocution, the result of that regular and sym-
metrical movement of the voice, which is caused by the compara-

just observance of those pauses, whether marked in the punctuation
or not, which the sense of a passage demands; and these pauses
thus become, like rests in music, portions of the measure and rhythm
It is this last mentioned effect which renders rhythm so important

flow of voice; the latter breaks the continuity both of sound and
sense.
Rhythm is, in detail, the regular recurrence of accent, at definite
and measured intervals, and may be beat and marked as strictly as
in music, if attention is paid to the suspensions of sound by pauses,
so as to include them, as well as the actual sounds of the voice, be-
tween the beats, as in the bars of music. Every accented syllable
is, in elocution, equivalent to the beginning of a bar in music, and
may be so marked; thus, | Muse | music | musical | un- | musical ;
or, if read with pauses | Muse | , | or 77 | music | , | or |
musical |, | or 771 7 un- | musical | .*
The subjoined exercises should be practised with the aid, at first,
of beating time at the commencement of every bar, as in music.
The rhythm should be, for some time, marked quite strongly with
the voice; the beat and the decided marking may be gradually laid
aside, as the ear becomes competent to direct itself. But the actual
time should never cease to be carefully observed in reading, speak-
ing, and reciting, any more than in music itself. The fact, however,
should never be forgotten, that an habitual strong marking of rhythm,
is the same fault in elocution as in music. It protrudes what should
be a barely perceptible property, and turns an excellence into a
defect. A delicate marking of rhythm, is a genuine grace of culti-
vated elocution, in the reading of verse, and in the language of ora-
tory or of sentiment. The great object of practice, as regards
“ time,” is truth, not force.
The student of elocution would do well to score numerous pas-
sages, for himself, in the manner exemplified as follows.
a
* Every accented monosyllable, in elocutionary rhythm, constitutes a
bar; all the unaccented syllables, in a polysyllable, are grouped in th
same bar, with the accented syllable, or pause preceding. The rule
marking is simply, Place a bar before every accented syllable, where
found, and before every pause. - One or more unaccented syllables ar.
sometimes grouped into the same bar with a pause. For the conven-
ience of marking, a bar is assumed as composed of one quarter or two
cighth notes.
Half or secondary accents, wherever they occur, commence a new
bar; thus, the syllable man-, in the word | manifes. | tation, or the sylla-
ble con., in the word in- | contro- | vertible.

* From the analysis which has been given of rhythm, in conjunction
with metrical accent in its principal forms, it may be perceived that, in
reading, the prosodial grouping of syllables is subordinate -- not pre-
dominant - in the audible effect. The common fault in reading verse
is caused by inverting this rule; and, when to this defect is added that
of omitting the rhythmical pauses, nothing is left to the ear but the
mere jingle of the scanning.

EXERCISES IV EMPHASIS.
Emphasis, as properly defined by Dr. Rush, in his Phi-
losophy of the Voice, and, indeed, as is implied in the
very etymology of the term, is not a mere comparative
force of accent only, but a concentration of several or of
many expressive elements of vocal sound, upon one ele-
ment or syllable. The comparative force does, no doubt,
exist; but its use is to embody and impress the effect of
the rest. Thus, if we select, as an example, the reply of
Death to Satar., " Back to thy punishment ! false fugitive,"
we shall find that the first of the emphatic words, while
* True rhythm extends itself not only from clause to clause, but from
sentence to sentence, and from paragraph to paragraph, and even to the
long quadruple pause which follows the close of a piece or discourse.
One of the faults in elocution by which the pulpit is sometimes degraded,
is the usiness-like dispatch with which the minister passes from the
la t word of his sermon to the formula that follows. - as if his purpose
were to obliterate, as quickly as possible, the effect of his discourse. -
Paragraph pauses are usually double the length of those of periods.
Double paragraph pauses are the proper distinctions of the heads of
discoursc; and these ought to be doubled, if referred to as a definite
measure for the pause which should follow an entire discourse.

it is intensely forcible, derives much of its effect from
“explosive" utterance and “radical stress,” from “aspi-
rated pectoral and guttural quality,” from “low pitch,"
“falling inflection,” or “ downward slide,” and “rapid
movement,” or “brief time;" and that if we subtract some
or even any one of these properties, the exclamation

EXERCISES IN “EXPRESSION.”
"
Expression,” in elocution, as in music, is the term
used to indicate the effect of feeling, in utterance. Thus,
the learner enunciates words without “ expression,” when
endeavoring to read, and still laboring under the difficulty
of combining the sounds of syllables: the finished reader
gives "expression," or throws feeling into what he reads.
“ Expression," therefore, in elocution, implies the ut.
terance of emotion in all its characteristic properties of
“,
quality," of voice, " force," "stress," "pitch," "inflec-
“
tion," "melody," "movement,” “ time,” — or “quantity,"
.
“rhythm,” and “pause," —"emphasis."
'
When“expression” is regarded in consecutive passages,
it is termed“ variation,” or, arbitrarily, - but not correct-
ly, — “modulation.”*
The following exercises should be assiduously prac-
tised, till every property of utterance, mentioned in each
designation, is combined, in full effect, on its example.

“ Thou breathest; — and the obedient storm is still :
Thou speakest;

Man's shattered ship the rushing waters fill,
And the hushed billows roll across his grave!
* The terms “key” and “modulation,” though in frequent use with
reference to elocution, belong exclusively to music; as there are no
correspondent facts, in speech and reading, to those which justify these
designations in music. See Dr. Rush's just observations on this point.

resort to any stagnant wasting reservoir of merit in me,

Its ghastly workings, (famine, or blue plague,
Battle, or siege, or flight through wintry snows,)
We, this whole people, have been clamorous
For war and bloodshed;- animating sports !
The which we pay for, as a thing to talk of,

No speculation or contingency,
However dim and vague, too vague and dim
To yield a justifying cause; and forth

And adjurations of the God in heaven)
We send our mandates for the certain death
Of thousands and ten thousands ! Boys and girls,
And women that would groan to see a child
Pull off an insect's leg, all read of war, -
The best amusement for our morning meal!
The poor wretch who has learned his only prayers
From curses, who knows scarcely words enough
To ask a blessing from his heavenly Father,
Becomes a fluent phrase-man, absolute
And technical in victories and defeats,
And all our dainty terms for fratricide;
Terms which we trundle smoothly o’er our tongues,
Like mere abstractions, empty sounds to which
We join no feeling, and attach no form!
As if the soldier died without a wound;
As if the fibres of this godlike frame
Were gored without a pang; as if the wretch
Who fell in battle, doing bloody deeds,
Passed off to heaven translated, and not killed;
As though he had no wife to pine for him, –
No God to judge him! Therefore, evil days
Are coming on us, O my countrymen!

Strongly retributive, should make us know

err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. 17.
Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,
neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows:
for every one is a hypocrite and an evil doer, and every
mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned
away; but his hand is stretched out still. 18. For wick
edness burneth as the fire; it shall devour the briers and
thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and
they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. 19.
Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land dark-

“ The world is full of wrongs and evils, and full of
wronged and suffering men. But still I do say that of all
wrongs, slavery is the greatest. It denies to man his
humanity, and all its highest and holiest rights. And of
all slavery, the African is the most monstrous. Other
men have fallen under this doom by the fate of war.
They have bought life at the price of bondage. With
Africa there has been no war but that of the prowling
man-stealer! He has gone up among the river-glades of
that ill-fated land; he has torn men and women and chil-
dren, from their country and their homes, who never did
him any wrong; he has hurried them to his prison-ship;
he has plunged them into the dungeon of “the middle
passage,” — middle passage! — phrase that passes in uni-
versal speech for all the atrocities that human nature can
inflict or endure, — he has thrust them down into that
dark, unbreathing confine, in mingling and writhing agony
and despair and disease and corruption and death; he has
borne them away, regardless of their tears and entreaties,

not what, of dark and gloomy, which expresses the fury

know not whether repentance or despair gives birth. He
is seized with convulsions, which they are ignorant wheth-
er to ascribe to the actual dissolution of his body, or to
the soul which feels the approach of its Judge. He deeply
sighs; and they know not whether the remembrance of
his past crimes, or the despair at quitting life, forces from
him such groans of anguish. At last, in the midst of these
melancholy exertions, his eyes fix, his features change,
his countenance becomes disfigured, his livid lips convul-

the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the
hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
people shall go and say, 'Come ye, and let us go up to
the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his paths:' for ont of Zion shall go forth the law, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 4. And he shall
judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people :
and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any
more. 5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in
the light of the Lord.”

The Pleasures of Youthful Piety. — Alison.
"In every part of Scripture, it is remarkable with what
singular tenderness the season of youth is always men-
tioned, and what hopes are afforded to the devotion of
the young."
“If these, then, are the effects and promises of youthful
piety, rejoice, O young man, in thy youth!- rejoice in
those days which are never to return, when religion comes
to thee in all its charms, and when the God of nature re-
veals himself to thy soul, like the mild radiance of the
morning sun, when he rises amid the blessings of a grate-
ful world. If already Devotion hath taught thee her
secret pleasures; - if, when Nature meets thee in all its
magnificence or beauty, thy heart humbleth itself in ado-
ration before the Hand which made it, and rejoiceth in
the contemplation of the wisdom by which it is main-
tained; if, when Revelation unveils her mercies, and the
Son of God cornes forth to give peace and hope to fallen
man,
thine eye follows with astonishment the glories of
his path, and pours at last over his cross those pious tears
which it is a delight to shed;- if thy soul accompanieth
him in his triumph over the grave, and entereth on the
wings of faith into that heaven 'where he sat down at
the right hand of the Majesty on high,' and seeth the
'society of angels and of the spirits of just men made per-
fect,' and listeneth to the 'everlasting song which is sung
before the throne: '. If such are the meditations in which
thy youthful hours are passed, renounce not, for all that
life can offer thee in exchange, these solitary joys. The
world which is before thee, - the world which thine im.
agination paints in such brightness, — has no pleasures to
-
bestow which can compare with these. And all that its
boasted wisdom can produce, has nothing so acceptable
in the sight of Heaven, as this pure offering of thy youth-
ful soul.”

The Enjoyments of the Poor, in Spring — Duncan.
“ This is truly the glad season of the year.
Wherever
we turn our eyes, Nature wears a smile of joy, as if,
freed from the storms and the cold of winter, she revelled
in the well enhanced luxury of spring. The lengthening
day, the increasing warmth of the air, and the gradually
deepening green of the awakened earth, excite in every
breast a lively sense of gratitude, and pleasingly affect
the imagination. A walk among the woods or fields, in a
calm spring day, when the trees are bursting forth into
beauty, and all the land is echoing with song, may well
soothe the stormiest passions, and inspire that ‘vernal de-
light,' which is able to drive away all sadness but de-
spair. The mind sympathizes with the joy of inanimate
Nature, and rejoices to behold the reviving beauty of the
carth, as if itself had escaped from a period of gloom, to
bask in the sunshine of hope and enjoyment.
“We are familiar with the joys of spring, as felt or
sung by poets and other ardent lovers of Nature. They
form the burden of many a poetic strain, and excite to
many a meditative reverie. They have inspired enthu-
siasın and deep delight, ever since there was an eye to
witness, or a mind to feel, the harmony and loveliness of
this gorgeously arrayed and breathing world. They are
the source of exquisite emotion to every mind, in which
dwells a sense of beauty and creative design. They also
light the brow of care, and bring back the flush of health
and hope to the pale and wasted cheek. And not only
by the rich and the enlightened, — by the children of lux-
ury and mental refinement, are the fine and indescrib-
able delights of this season deeply felt and valued; spring
is also a time of increased enjoyment to the poor. It fills
the inmates of many an humble dwelling with gladness,
and makes even desponding poverty smile, and hope for
beiter days.

“ There is something in the flowery sweetness and
genial warmth of spring, that kindles in the rudest bosom
feelings of gratitude and pleasure. The contrast to the
cold and desolation of winter, is so striking and agreeable,
that every heart, unless it be hardened by the direst ig-
norance and crime, is melted to love and pious emotion;
and breathings of deep-felt adoration escape from the
most untutored lips. The carols of the ploughman, as he
traverses the field, the live-long day, and turns up the
fresh soil, seem to bespeak a lightsome heart, and evince
the joyousness of labor. The shepherd, as he sits upon
the hill-side and surveys his quiet flock with its sportive
companies of lambs, - those sweetest emblems of inno-
cent mirth, — feels a joy and calm satisfaction, that is
heightened by the recollection of the vanished snow-
storms of recent winter, and of all the anxieties and toils
attending his peculiar charge. Even the hard-working
mechanic of the village or town, shares the general glad-
ness of the season. As he strolls in sweet relaxation into
the glittering fields, or along the blossoming hedgerows
and lanes, haply supporting with his hand the tottering
footsteps of his child, or carrying the tender infant in his
arms, he breathes the freshning air, treads the reviving
turf beneath his feet, and inhales the first faint perfumes,
and listens to the first melodies of the year, with an en-
joyment that his untaught powers of expression cannot
describe.”

Religious Retirement.
Logan.
" Religious retirement takes off the impression which
the neighborhood of evil example has a tendency to make
upon the mind. The world, my friends, is not in general
a school of virtue, it is often the scene of vanity and vice.
Corrupted manners, vicious deeds, evil communications,
surround us on every side.
To avoid the pollution with which the world is in-
fected, to keep off the intrusion of vain and sinful thoughts,
enter into thy chamber, and shut thy doors around thee.
There the wicked cease from troubling, there the man
who is wearied of the world is at rest. There the glare
of external objects disappears, and the chains that bound
you to the world, are broken. There you shut out the
strife of tongues, the impertinences of the idle, the lies of
the vain, the scandal of the malicious, the slanders of the
defamer, and all that world of iniquity which proceeds
froin the tongue. In this asylum thy safety dwells. To
thy holy retreat, an impure guest dares not approach.
Enjoying the blessed calm and serenity of thy own mind,
thou hearest the tempest raging around thee, and spend-
ing its strength; the objects of sense being removed, the
appetites which they excited, depart along with them.
The scene being shiſted, and the actors gone, the pas-
sions which they raised, die away.”

assumes the appearance of soberness and silence. It is
an hour from which everywhere the thoughtless fly, as
peopled only in their imagination with images of gloom:
- it is the hour, on the other hand, which, in
every age,
the wise have loved, as bringing with it sentiments and
affections more valuable than all the splendors of the
day.
" Its first impression is to still all the turbulence of
thought or passion which the day may have brought forth.
We follow, with our eye, the descending sun,
we listen
to the decaying sounds of labor and of toil, - and, when
all the fields are silent around us, we feel a kindred still-
ness to breathe upon our souls, and to calm them from
the agitations of society.
“From this first impression, there is a second which
naturally follows it;- in the day we are living with men,
in the eventide we begin to live with nature;
see the world withdrawn from us, - the shades of night
darken over the habitations of men; and we feel our-
selves alone. It is an hour fitted, as it would seem, by
Him who made us, to still, but with gentle hand, the
throb of every unruly passion, and the ardor of every im-
pure desire; and while it veils for a time the world that
misleads us, to awaken in our hearts those legitimate af-
fections which the heat of the day may have dissolved.
“ There is yet a farther scene it presents to us:-
While the world withdraws from us, and while the shades
of the evening darken upon our dwellings, the splendors
of the firmament come forward to our view. In the mo-
ments when earth is overshadowed, heaven opens to our
eyes the radiance of a sublimer Being; our hearts follow
the successive splendors of the scene; and while we
forget, for a time, the obscurity of earthly concerns, we

Expression " as before, but enlivened by Cheerfulness.
A Cheerful Mind. - Addison.
"I cannot but look upon a cheerful state of mind as a
constant habitual gratitude to the great Author of nature.
An inward cheerfulness is an implicit praise and thanks-
giving to Providence, under all its dispensations. It is a
kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we are placed,
and a secret approbation of the Divine will in his conduct
towards man.
A man who uses his best endeavors to live according
to the dictates of virtue and right reason, has two perpet-
ual sources of cheerfulness, — in the consideration of his
own nature, and of that Being on whom he has a depen-
dence. If he looks into himself, he cannot but rejoice in
that existence, which is so lately bestowed upon him, and
which, after millions of ages, will be still new, and still
in its beginning. How many self-congratulations natu-
rally arise on the mind, when it reflects on this its en-
trance into eternity, when it takes a view of those im-
provable faculties, which in a few years, and even at its
first setting out, have made so considerable a progress,
and which will be still receiving an increase of perfec-
tion, and consequently an increase of happiness! The
consciousness of such a being spreads a perpetual diffu-
sion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man, and makes
him look upon himself, every moment, as more happy
than he knows how to conceive.
· The second source of cheerfulness to a good mind, is,
its consideration of that Being on whom we have our de-
pendence, and in whom, though we behold him as yet
but in the first faint discoveries of his perfections, we see
everything that we can imagine as great, glorious, or
amiable. We find ourselves everywhere upheld by his
goodness, and surrounded with an immensity of love and
mercy. In short, we depend upon a Being, whose power
qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means,
a

whose good'ress and truth engage him to make those
happy who desire it of him, and whose unchangeableness
will secure us in this happiness to all eternity.
Such considerations, which every one should perpet-
ually cherish in his thoughts, will banish from us all that
secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are sub-
ject to when they lie under no real affliction, — all that
anguish which we may feel from any evil that actually
oppresses us, — to which I may likewise add those little
cracklings of mirth and folly, that are apter to betray
virtue than support it; and establish in us such an even
and cheerful temper, as makes us pleasing to ourselves,
to those with whom we converse, and to Hiru whom we
are made to please."
EXERCISES IN “ VARIATION.”
-
The term “variation," in its relations to elocution, is
used as a convenient designation for the change of " ex
pression,” which occurs in passing from the utterance of
one emotion to that of another, in successive reading or
speaking. It is, in reality, nothing else than true expres.
sion, adapted to the variations of feeling, in consecutive
passages. The term “modulation” is in popular lan-
guage often employed, - though incorrectly, as regards
musical nomenclature, - to designate the changes of
voice which arise from change of feeling.
The actual variation, however, by whatever name it
may be called, is felt, by all hearers, to be an essential
point in elocution, as the only means of rendering senti-
ment natural or impressive to the ear. An unvaried voice,
as contrasted with one which gives a change of effect to
every new turn of thought or feeling, is, relatively, as the
dead body contrasted with the living man. The student
cannot be too careful to repeat exercises such as the fol-
lowing, till his voice has acquired perfect flexibility, and
the full power of instant change of effect, from the style

of one emotion to that of another. Some passages re-
quire frequent and entire changes of every trait of voice,
to keep up with the perpetually shifting effect of senti-
ment and expression, in the language of the composition.

site exercises in this department of elocution; but they
may suffice to suggest the mode in which practice should
be conducted.

Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam
May I express thee unblamed ? Since God is Light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity; dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate!
Or hear'st thou, rather, pure ethereal stream
Whose fountain who shall tell ? Before the sun
Before the heavens thou wert, and, at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle didst invest
The rising world of waters, dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,
Escaped the Stygian pool, though long detained
In that obscure sojourn, while on my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of chaos and eternal night,
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
Though hard and rare. Thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy sovereign vital lamp.

success. It was these that put far away from our fathers'
cause, all patrician softness, all hereditary claims to pre-
ëminence. No effeminate nobility crowded into the dark
and austere ranks of the pilgrims. No Carr or Villiers
would lead on the ill-provided band of despised puritans.
No well-endowed clergy were on the alert, to quit their
cathedrals, and set up a pompous hierarchy in the frozen
wilderness. No craving governors were anxious to 'be
sent over to our cheerless El Dorado of ice and snow.
No, they could not say they had encouraged, patronized,
or helped the pilgrims: their own cares, their own labors,
their own councils, their own blood, contrived all, achieved
all, bore all, sealed all. They could not afterwards fairly
pretend to reap where they had not strown; and as our
fathers reared this broad and solid fabric with pains and

READING OF THE SCRIPTURES.
The mechanical and unmeaning style of reading, which
arises from prevalent defects in early education, is no-
where more perceptible or more injurious in effect, than
when exemplified in a passage of Scripture. With the
language of the sacred volume are associated all the high-
est thoughts and profoundest emotions of which the soul
is susceptible; and our utterance, in the reading of its
pages, ought to be the expression of such states of mind.
But no book, generally speaking, is read with less of ap-
propriate feeling or expressive sense.
The Scriptures are not unfrequently read with tones
which do not indicate any personal interest, on the part
of the reader, in the sentiments which he is uttering.
The effect of the cold, dry style, commonly adopted in
reading the Bible, is often, indeed, rendered utterly ab-
surd, when the attention happens, for a moment, to fall
on the oriental fervor and sublimity of the style of lan-
guage, in contrast with the meagre and shabby effect of
the readers' voice. The words, in such cases, speak of
God and of eternity, in strains which the undebased mind
associates with the vastness of the overhanging firma-
ment, and the grandeur of the reverberating thunder; but
the reader's tone is that of the coolest indifference, or of
an affair ordinary and trivial. The fault of a cold, inex-
pressive voice, is often the result of an anxiety to shun
all appearance of assumed and imposing style, and to
allow the hearer to feel for himself, the solemnity of the
subject. But as it is destitute of the natural indication of

а
earnestness, in the reader, it deadens the sympathy of
the hearer.
Another error in the style of reading, is that of loading
the words of Scripture with a formal, unwieldly, and un.
meaning tone, which aims at a certain solemn dignity of
effect, but only reaches a very unmusical song.
Sometimes, a third fault is incurred, by a desire to
break through the trammels of conventional restraint, and
produce a lively impression on the mind, by familiar and
vivid tone, which savors too much of ordinary talk by the
fireside. But coldness and familiarity are alike forbidden,
on subjects which appeal to the deepest susceptibilities
of the heart.
The monotonous solemnity of tone, which is exempli-
fied by many readers of the sacred volume, defeats its
own purpose, by a dull uniformity of effect; as a painter
would spoil a picture by the exclusive use of one sombre
tint, applied indiscriminately to scenes of evening, morn-
ing, and midday. The cold, indifferent reader seems to
forget the vivid interest which appropriately belongs to
every subject introduced in the pages of Scripture; the
lively reader seems, by his familiar and anecdotic style,
to overlook the majesty of the sacred volume; but the
formal reader seems blind to all the varied beauties of
language, and the natural and simple expression, which
pervade, and so peculiarly characterize, both the Old
Testament and the New.
The dignity of the subject, the sublimity of the style,
the simplicity of the language, demand, in every passage
of Scripture, the mingling effects of grave, full, and vivid
espression. To the reading of the sacred page should be
brought every aid arising from the deepest impressions
on the heart, the most vivid effects of poetic imagination,
the most refining influences of the highest intellectual
culture. All the treasures of knowledge, gathered by ex-
cursive thought from the fields of science and literature,
all the richer and truer wealth of life and experience,

which an individual possesses, - and which never fails
to modify the qualities and expression of the voice,
should be made tributary to the exercise of reading the
sacred Scriptures, in the offices of devotion. The spirit-
ual and the intellectual nature of man is then, if ever, at
its maximum of experience and of power, when permitted,
to mingle its workings with those of the Divine mind in
revelation.
The defectiveness and poverty of our modes of educa-
tion, together with the deadening effects of habit and
routine, convert the reading of the most impressive of all
books into an ineffectual ceremony. A living and a gen-
uine culture in early life, a culture which should cherish
the expressive powers of man, would effectually prevent
these and similar results. That such would be the gen-
eral issue, no one can doubt, who has observed the effects
of faithful self-culture, in a single instance.
Who can
ever forget the impressions left on his mind by hearing,
even once, a passage of Scripture read by the late Dr.
Nettleton, with that characteristic depth and vividness of
effect, which seemed to bespeak a soul communing, face
to face, with the Invisible? Who, that was ever present
on such an occasion, can forget the hushed and profound
attention with which a congregation would listen to the
deep and quiet, but thrilling tones of Channing, in the
exercise of reading the sacred volume ?
The mindless and heartless style in which the Bible is
read, at school, when it is made a part of the requisite
exercises for acquiring a merely mechanical facility in
the process of reading, fastens itself upon the ear, as an
unconscious standard of 'manner, for life; so much so,
that the majority of readers in the pulpit, seem never to
imagine, that they can ever so far identify themselves
with what they read, as to render it the common justice
of a single true or natural tone of the voice.*
* The weekly reading of the Bible, as a Saturday exercise, in the
parish schools of Scotland, is usually accompanied by oral explanations

Could we, for a moment, divest ourselves of the influ.
ence of association, and, — standing aloof from “ things
as they are,” in the “second nature" of habit, — fasten
our minds on the great thought, that the world contains a
volume stamped with the legible impress of Revelation,
would not our just expectation be that those whose duty
it is to minister at the altar, would covet, above all acqui-
sitions, the ability to read it worthily and impressively?
At present, the thing is not even thought of. The very
idea startles the theological student, as something odd.
But when you come to inquire into the case, you find
that he has, all along, had his mind on a certain shabby,
dingy-looking, much worn volume, out of which, in com-
mon with others of his age, he had, in the days of his
boyhood, to learn to read, at school; or from which he
had to read a single detached verse, in the daily routine
of family devotion; or which, in the long, weary, warm,
summer sabbaths, he used to hear droned over in the
pulpit.
Mere animation, or a rhetorical style, in reading the
Scriptures, is unquestionably offensive, both to just sen-
timent and good taste, and to be as carefully avoided as
the other faults which have been enumerated. But while
all artificial and fancied excellence, is, in the utterance of
the words of sacred truth, a thing that only disgusts or
shocks a sober mind, it is not less true, that genuine cul.
tivation and diligent practice, are as successful in this, as
in any other form of human effort, and that when the oc-
cupants of our pulpits shall have acquitted themselves in
this as in other parts of their public duties, the power and
authority, and the daily influence of the sacred volume,
will penetrate society to an extent corresponding to the
difference between a dormant and an active life,
tent and an operative power.

READING OF THE
293
SCRIPTURES.
Classification of the Parts of Scripture.
The Bible, regarded for the moment, as a volume which
may be used for the purposes of audible reading, may be
classified, in rhetorical arrangement, as follows:
1. Narrative passages, varying in style, with their sub-
jects, from the familiar to the sublime, as in the histor-
ical books of the Old Testament, and the Gospels, in the
New.
2. Didactic and doctrinal passages, as in the Epistles,
which, being addressed to the understanding and the rea-
son, require modifications of voice in the forms, chiefly, of
inflection, emphasis, and pause, - the intellectual instru-
ments of effect in elocution.
3. Prophetic and Descriptive passages, - marked by
the language of strong epic and dramatic emotion, and
requiring a bold, vivid, and expressive style of voice.
4. Lyric passages, - requiring intense expression, in
strains of joy, pathos, triumph, grief, adoration, supplica-
tion.
NARRATIVE PASSAGES.
The ancient rhetorical arrangement of “ low,” or famil-
iar, "middle," and "sublime," or elevated styles, may be
practically serviceable in arranging the narrative portions
of Scripture, for the purposes of elocution. The first
division, ("the low,") would comprise all simple and
familiar narrations; the last, ("the sublime,") narrative
passages of great elevation of style; the second, (“ the
middle,”) would include whatever forms of narrative were
neither so familiar as the first, nor so elevated as the
third.
Passages which exemplify the style of familiar narra-
tion, demand attention to the due observance of two op-
posite principles of expression in elocution, - granuleur
and simplicity; the former being inseparable from sacred

subjects, - the latter, from the peculiar style of innguage,
in the Scriptures. The former mode of expression in
elocution, unmodified by the latter, would assume the
form of deep “ pectoral,” and full “orotund” utterance,–
a grave, round, ample, and swelling effect of voice. The
latter mode of expression, on the contrary, would incline
to “oral” quality, - a higher, thinner, and softer utter-
ance, approaching to that of colloquial style. The mild
effect of this style of utterance, blending with that of
“ orotund” grandeur, softens and chastens it to a gentle
expression, but does not impair its dignity. The effect
on the ear is similar to that produced on the eye and the
mind, by a noble deportment softened by condescension.
The common faults in the style of reading the familiar
narrative passages of Scripture, are dry monotony, undue
vivacity, pompous solemnity, rhetorical and forced varia-
tion. The analysis of the appropriate tone for such pas-
sages, would suggest that the familiar narratives of the
books of Scripture, should be read with a deeper, softer,
and slower voice, than similar compositions in other works ;
the whole style vivid, earnest, but subdued, - indicating, at
the same time, the interest awakened by the events which
are related, and the chastening effect of the reverence due
to the sacred volume.

• My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-

him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the
wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on
the altar upon the wood. 10. And Abraham stretched
forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 11.
And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven,
and said, ' Abraham, Abraham!' And he said, “ Here am

neither do thou anything unto him: for now I know that
thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son,

13. “And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and
behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his

him

EXAMPLES IN “MIDDLE” STYLE.
Narrative passages which, according to rhetorical ar-
rangement, may be classed under the head of “middle"
style, require, in reading, a tone of voice which is deeper,
firmer, and more uniformly sustained, than that of simple
and familiar narration, as exemplified in the preceding
extracts.
A homely, anecdotic turn of voice, is decidedly objec-
tionable, even in the reading of ordinary historical inci-
dents, as utterly incompatible with the appropriate dignity
and elevation of the subject; and the objection to such
tones becomes insuperable, when the themes are those
of sacred history. The effect of fireside, colloquial into-
nation, applied to the pages of the Bible, is similar, in its
effect, to that of parody on elevated composition. It sug-
gests degrading and ridiculous associations.
A formal and mechanical solemnity of tone, however,
can never comport with the reading of a book so remark-

The Death of Abel. — Gen. iv. 3—14.
V. 3. “And in process of time it came to pass, that
Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto
the Lord. 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings
of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had
respect unto Abel, and to his offering: 5. but unto Cain,
and to his offering, he had not respect. And Cain was
very wroth, and his countenance feil. 6. And the Lord
said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth ? and why is thy
countenance fallen? 7. If thou doest well, shalt thou
not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at

shalt rule over him.' 8. And Cain talked with Abel bis
brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field,
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
9. " And the Lord said untc Cain, ' Where is Abel thy
brother?' And he said, 'I know not: Am I my brother's
keeper?' 10. And he said, 'What hast thou done? the
voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the
ground. 11. and now art thou cursed from the earth,
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's
blood from thy hand. 12. When thou tillest the ground,
it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength: A
fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.' 13.
And Cain said unto the Lord, 'My punishment is greater
than I can bear. 14. Behold, thou hast driven me out
this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face
shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
in the earth ; and it shall come to pass, that every one
that findeth me shall slay me.'”

EXAMPLES IN ELEVATED STYLE.
Narration, when characterized by sublimity, or by mark-
ed elevation, requires a deeper, fuller, slower, more forcible
and impressive manner, than that which is exemplified in
the preceding passages.
The common fault in the reading of such parts of Scrip-
ture, consists in the absence of an impressive and com-
manding effect of voice, correspondent to the peculiar
character of the subject. The mode of utterance, in such
passages as the following, should not only be deep-toned
and energetic, but warm and glowing Fervor is a prom-

inent element in the expression of sublimity anu grud-
deur.
While the voice, however, is rendered full and reso-
nant, in the reading of the loftier and bolder portions of
Scripture narrative, correct taste and chastened judgment
alike forbid all rhetorical display and inflation of manner,
as utterly inconsistent with the genuine utterance of the
language of the sacred records. The voice, though glow-
ing with emotion, is, in such circumstances, to be sub-
dued to the mood of reverence and hallowed association.
No true heart can tolerate the idea of using the word of
God as a theatre for the exhibition of vocal effect and
artistic accomplishment.
While the reader shrinks, however, from such results,
he can derive from this just repugnance to desecration no
plea for the cold, lifeless, and heartless style of mechani-
cal reading, which is so prevalent in the pulpit, and which
effectually paralyzes the power of the Bible over the hu-
man heart.

DIDACTIC PASSAGES.
The peculiar mode of voice which characterizes appro-
priate didactic reading, in ordinary composition, as differ-
ing from that which belongs to narrative or descriptive
style, holds good, also, in the reading of the Scriptures.
Narration and description address themselves, in many
instances, to feeling and imagination, for their chief ef-
fect; while didactic subjects are usually directed exclu-
sively, or nearly so, to the reason and judgment, through
the understanding.
Narrative and descriptive reading, accordingly, abound,
comparatively, in vivid and varied tones, associated with
the different moods of sympathy and emotion. Didactic
reading holds a more steady, uniform, and regulated
course of utterance, adapted to a clear, distinct convey-
ance of thought to the intellect. It depends less on em-
passioned variation of voice, and more on correct and
exact articulation, - less on vivid tone and strong expres-
sion, more on true inflection, just emphasis, and appropri-
ate pauses, as aids to the effect of clear apprehension and
precise discrimination.
The common faults in the reading of didactic portions
of Scripture, are a mechanical and inexpressive tone, the
lifeless result of mere habit; a heavy, solemn, grandiose
style, destitute of spirit and effect; a formal, sermonizing
manner, utterly unsuited to the simple and vivid style of
Scripture instruction; an over familiar, flippant utter-
ance, which divests the language of the sacred volume
of its dignity and authority, and its proper power over the
soul.
The doctrinal parts of the Bible, require, in reading, a
firm, energetic, spirited, authoritative, but quiet and steady
voice; perfectly clear and distinct in enunciation, free
from any dryness or formality, and breathing a tone of
conscious dignity and power, blended with that of mild.
ness, condescension, gentleness, and affectionate interest.

EXAMPLES IN ORAL AND PARABOLIC STYLE.
From the Sermon on the Mount.
- Matthew VI.
V. 1. “ Take heed that ye do not your alms before
men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward
of your Father which is in heaven. 2. Therefore, when
thot doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before
thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the
streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily, I say
unto you, They have their reward. 3. But when thou
doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doeth; 4. That thine alms may be in secret: and
thy Father which seeth in secret, himself shall reward
thee openly.
5. “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the syn-
agogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may
be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their
I
reward. 6. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
closet; and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy
Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth
in secret, shall reward thee openly.
7. “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the
heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
their much speaking. 8. Be not ye therefore like unto
them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have
need of before ye ask him. 9. After this manner there-
fore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name. 10. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done in earth as it is in heaven. 11. Give us this day
our daily dread. 12. And forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors. 13. And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and
the power, and the glory, forever. Amen. 14. For, if
ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
will also forgive you: 15. But, if ye forgive not men

trespasses.

of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that
they may appear unto men to fast. Verily,
Verily, I say unto
you, They have their reward.
17. But thou, when thou
fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; 18. That
thou appear not unto men, to fast, but unto thy Father,
which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
shall reward thee openly.
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth
where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
break through and steal: 20. But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth
corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be
also. 22. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
23. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full
of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be
darkness, how great is that darkness !
24. “ No man can serve two masters; for either he will
hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to
the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon. 25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what
ye
shall
drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is
not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither
do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
27. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit
unto his stature? 28. And why take ye thought for rai.
ment? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow;
they toil not, neither do they spin; 29. And yet I say
unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not ar-
rayed like one of these. 30. Wherefore, if God so clothe

the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is
cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
O
ye of little faith? 31. Therefore take no thought, saying,
What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, where-
withal shall we be clothed? 32. (For after all these
things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father
knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33. But
seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you. 34. Take
therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof."

are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
under sin; 10. As it is written, There is none righteous,
no, not one: 11. There is none that understandeth, there
is none that seeketh after God. 12. They are all gone
out of the way, they are together become unprofitable :
there is none that doeth good, no, not one 13. Their
throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 14.
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. 15. Their
feet are świft to shed blood. 16. Destruction and misery
are in their ways: 17. And the way of peace have they
not known. 18. There is no fear of God before their
eyes.
19. “ Now we know that what things soever the law
saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every
mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God. 20. Therefore by the deeds of the
law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for by
the law is the knowledge of sin. 21. But now the right,
eousness of God without the law is manifested, being
witnessed by the law and the prophets; 22. Even the
righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ
unto all, and upon all them that believe: for there is no
difference: 23. For all have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God; 24. Being justified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 25. Whom
God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in
his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission
of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
26. To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that
he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
in Jesus.
27. “Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By
what law ? of works ? Nay: but by the law of faith. 28.
Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith
without the deeds of the law. 29. Is he the God of the

Gentiles also: 30. Seeing it is one God which shall jus-
tify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through

God forbid: yea, we establish the law.”

PASSAGES FROM THE PROPHETIC WRITINGS.
The prophets are distinguished, among the sacred
writers, for poetic beauty and grandeur of thought, and
for graphic and dramatic effect of style. The prophetic
books embody more descriptive power and vivid expres-
sion, than any other writings whatever. They require,
accordingly, more intensity and variety of tone, in read-
ing, - a nobler majesty of utterance, a fuller, deeper,
stronger, character of voice,- a perfect “orotund quality.”
The oriental fervor of emotion, and the poetic and im-
aginative language which characterize the prophets, taken
in connection with their sublime force of thought, natur-
ally call for a higher degree of energy in the voice, than
is required for ordinary reading, or even for the style of
the other writers of the sacred volume. The appropriate
reading of most portions of the prophetic books, requires,
likewise, a more marked and peculiar “stress,” than oc-
curs in forms of writing less expressive and peculiar.
The style of prophetic language, in the Sacred Scriptures,
is not less striking in regard to its effect on the pitch of
the voice. It abounds in the solemn and majestic tones
of the epic, in the transports of joy and the bursts of grief
peculiar to the lyric ode, and in the abrupt conversational
turns of dramatic dialogue. Its variety and range of pitch,
therefore, are remarkable; and to the same causes are
owing its frequent use of special “ inflections," as the
"wave," the “monotone,” the bold “downward slide" of

309
exclamation and command, and the acute “rising inflec-
tion” of eager and stern interrogation. The “movement”
of the voice, too, in the appropriate reading of passages
from the prophets, is strikingly marked in every degree
required by intense and varied emotion, from the slowest
style of awe, gloom, and horror; to the rapid rate of haste,
joy, and triumph. The whole style of elocution, in this
department of Scripture reading, is marked by the pecu-
liar force of its emphasis, the occasional brevity, and the
occasional impressive length, of its pauses, the intensity
of its “expression," and the abruptness and extent of its
“ variation.”

the golden wedge of Ophir. 13. Therefore I will shake
the heavens; and the earth shall remove out of her place,
in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his

as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man
turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own
land. 15. Every one that is found shall be thrust through;
and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the
sword. 16. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces
before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their
wives ravished. 17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes
against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for
gold, they shall not delight in it. 18. Their bows also
shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have
no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not
spare children.

of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God over-
threw Sodom and Gomorrah. 20. It shall never be in-
habited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to
generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there;
neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 21. But
wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses
shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell
there, and satyrs shall dance there. 22. And the wild
beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses,
and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and 'her time is
near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.”

THE READING OF HYMNS.
This department of pulpit elocution is one which re-
quires, more than any other, the closest attention of the
student. Our existing modes of education are so gener-
ally imperfect, as regards the early training of the voice,
that habit is, in most cases, formed to defective and erro-
neous modes of reading, long before an individual has
arrived at maturity. Few persons, comparatively, seem

to possess the power of uttering the words of a lyric
stanza, in the spirit of poetic feeling; and few, indeed,
seem capable of reading verse without a false intonation,
which, when applied to the beautiful language of the
poet, makes it fall on the ear
“Like sweet bells jangled, - out of tune and harsh."
Many pulpit readers are actually so little moulded, either
by nature or art, for the exercise of devotional reading,
that the loftiest inspirations of the sacred muse, become,
in their hands, absolute doggerel to the ear. The asso-
ciations of devotion are thus thrust out of the mind of the
hearer, to make room for those of ludicrous incongruity. -
No reformation in the modes of public or of private life,
is more urgently demanded by general sentiment, than a
change, as regards the power of the Christian ministry to
render the services of the pulpit appropriate and impres-
sive in manner.
In no respect is present deficiency so
deeply and so generally felt, as in the preparatory act of

reading the hymn, which should be, - in the reading not
less than the singing of it, the living voice of assem-
hled hearts lifted to the throne of Infinite Majesty. The
reading of the hymn should be the prelude by which both
congregation and choir have their souls attuned to the
sentiment of the sacred song, before entering on the per-
formance of the accompanying strains of music. The
best security for the appropriate and truly expressive
singing of a psalm or hymn, is that just and impressive
reading of it, which imparts its spirit to heart and ear.
But to fulfil the apostolic injunction of “making melody
in the heart,” after a dull, cold, prosaic, or see-saw read-
ing of the hymn, is a task next to impracticable. An at-
tentive eye may, in fact, see that, in such circumstances,
the youthful and the thoughtless among a congregation,
have, sometimes, as much as they can do, to preserve
decorum.
The situation of the student of theology, is by no
means favorable to the acquisition of a command over
the voice, such as the appropriate utterance of poetic sen-
timent, and, especially, in the lyric form, necessarily re-
quires. He shares, in early years, in all the common
disadvantages of imperfect cultivation of the vocal or-
gans; and the sedentary and secluded life of his boyhood
and youth, tends directly to reduce his power of organic
action and expression. His daily life is one of intense
cerebral action, in which the vital energies are withdrawn,
to a great extent, from the muscular and nervous systems,
which are the special apparatus of expressive action. As
a student, he loses energy, and vivacity, and susceptibil-
ity, which are the necessary measures of his expressive
power. The passive capacity of impression, which he
has acquired by reading and contemplation, might, under
a judicious system of proportioned culture, have been an
element of vast effect; but its excess actually renders it
an obstacle to expression. The receptive sensibility of
the soul not being balanced by the power of utterance,

oppresses rather than enlivens feeling, and quells rather
than inspires the voice. Habit, and culture, and skill,
are all required to render feeling tributary to expression.
Passion and imagination are not less important to the
reader than to the poet; and the discipline of these much
neglected parts of man's constitution, is as valuable to
the former as to the latter. Hence the great moment of
personal cultivation and self-education in elocution, to
him who would worthily occupy the pulpit, as the leader
of an assembly met for the purposes of devotion.
The power over human feeling which lies in a hymn
appropriately read, is indescribable. It is difficult, indeed,
for the most indifferent heart to escape from the appointed
influence of the sanctuary, when the minister yields his
whole soul to the sentiment and spirit of a hymn, and
gives these forth in tones that come fresh from the great
fount of feeling, and hallow the imagination with the
presence of devotional associations. Add to such effects
that of the well-tuned voice which breathes life and mu-
sic into sound, and thus gives presence and audible beau-
ty to the spirit of poetry; and the result becomes a com-
bination which no man can resist, whose heart is not
seared to every good influence.*
Music is universally recognized as of divine ordination
for the purposes of worship. But it is too generally for-
goften that poetry is so also, and that, without the inspi-
ration of the latter, the former is but the “ sounding brass
and the tinkling cymbal.” The reading of the eminent
servant of God referred to in the note to the preceding
paragraph, ever indicated, in the tone and expression of
*“If I have ever been of any use, as an instrument of spiritual good,
it has been, to a great extent, through the reading of sacred poetry :
were I have had my choice of means, I have selected it in preference
to any other. I would charge it on you, young men, to cultivate and
cherish this invaluable aid to your usefulness.” Such were the words
of the lato Dr. Netileton to the students around his bed, during his last
illness.

the hymn, a soul baptized into its inmost sentiment and its
deepest effect. His low-pitched, solemn, but sweet into-
nation could quell and absorb every heart in an assem-
bled multitude, and cause the very frame of the hearer to
thrill with the deep-felt sense of the reality of spiritual
truths. The unlettered working.man felt, then, the effi-
cacy of a human voice hallowed by genuine devotional
feeling; and the cultivated student became aware how
imagination, and taste, and ear, might all be rendered
tributary to the deepest spiritual impressions.
But, in addition to the usual disadvantages of imperfect
culture, the clergyman, in the daily routine of life's active
duties, has a host of impediments to the appropriate and
impressive use of the voice, in conducting the part of
public worship to which we now refer. He needs pecu-
liar preventives to counteract unfavorable influences. He
is called, not unfrequently, from the midst of active duties
of a merely temporary, but, perhaps, of an exciting and
absorbing character, to conduct the devotions of a week-
day prayer meeting. He commences, perhaps, with the
reading of a hymn, with the din and the bustle of busi-
ness yet sounding in his ears, and its unavoidable cares
yet lingering about his heart. Happy for him then, if his
early culture had given him that instant susceptibility of
feeling, by which the charm of poetry, lending its tribu-
tary aid to the spirit of devotion, the lines which he be-
gins to read should instantly raise his soul to the height
of seeing Him who is invisible, and inspire the power of
uplifting the heart of the worshipping assemblage, by the
utterance of a spirit attuned to the vivid tones of deep
and genuine emotion! Without a degree of such effect,
the reading of the hymn is but a desecration, and the
meeting but a ceremony.
Yet how often are such occa-
sions found to pass unprofitably by, from, in part, this
very circumstance! It were, perhaps, well worth while
to inquire whether the coldness and deadness of heart
which are so often lamented at such meetings, are not, in

degree, owing to the absence of those appropriate expres-
sions of the heart, which devotional poetry was meant to
secure in the voice. Here, as elsewhere, there is a plain
question of means and ends often overlooked, amidst a
vain inquiry after remote rather than present sources of
evil.
The student, in practising the following exercises,
should fix his attention on two points mainly, - the deep
feeling of the sentiment in each example, and the full
expression of the heart in the tones of the voice. Next
to these points ranks the correct “intonation,” by means
of inflection and “ melody;" so as to keep the voice in
tune, according to the form of poetry presented in each
stanza.
The full expression of feeling, is - from our corrupted
conventional habits in daily social life, which withhold
the utterance of the heart, and muffle the sounds of the
voice, a thing which most students are apt to shrink
from, under the very erroneous impression, that, if they
give full and free vent to the emotion which a hymn in-
spires, they will appear affected or theatrically excessive
in style, or deficient in judgment and taste. The elocu-
tionist replies that genuine feeling can never be mistaken,
and that such fears are unfounded. It is by listening to
such suggestions that our prevalent coldness in hymn-
reading is produced. True elocution was perfectly exem-
plified in the noble and beautiful and impressive reading
of the eminent individual before mentioned: no one ever
ventured the insinuation that his manner was artificial or
theatrical. What is needed is a full heart and a natural
utterance, not labor and effort to reach a certain style
or effect.
Another source of defective hymn-reading, is the want
of discrimination as to the proper difference between the
tones of ordinary conversation and of prose reading, -in
contrast with the appropriate style of utterance, which
applies to the language of poetry; more especially when
1

the latter assumes the form of sacred lyrics, – the highest
species of all verse. Many readers shrink from the full
expression of feeling and imagination, in the high-wrought
forms which these justly assume in the composition of
psalms and hymns, because, say they, such expression is
not natural or habitual to us; it seems forced and exces-
sive: we prefer to read in a plain, unpretending style.
Such is, usually, the plea offered for reading poetry, in
its sublimest and most sacred forms, as if it were not only
flat prose but hum-drum, or familiar talk. It is forgotten,
in such cases, that the standard of conversation and of
prose reading cannot apply to poetry of a lofty or a sol.
emn character, and that the tones in which we talk of
domestic incidents and ordinary affairs, can never be
those in which we can properly discourse of God, eter-
nity, and immortality.
But the prevalent fault of some readers, is, to utter
every stanza of every hymn with one uniform, heavy,
and unwieldly solemnity of voice, which observes no dis-
tinction of subject, style, or versification, and kills the
effect of every form of sentiment by a dull monotony.
The peculiar vividness and fire, the pathos and the fer-
vor, the sublime force of lyric compositions, are thus alto-
gether lost to heart and ear. The whole design of the
composition of hymns, is thus defeated; and the soul
remains uninspired, the feelings untouched.
The minor details of defective elocution in the reading
of hymns, regard chiefly the application of the rules of
inflection. False “intonation” commonly consists in over-
looking the distinctive slide of verse, as contrasted with
those of prose. The former varies but little in effect frem
the “monotone,” and does not, in most passages, tran-
scend the limits of the interval of the “second,” or the
slightest rise of voice except the plaintive “semitone.”
The use of the larger intervals of “thirds” and “fifths,”
turns poetry into prose, so far as the ear is concerned.
To persons whose ear is not trained to these distinctions
27*

in music and in elocution, it may be sufficient to say that
the fault lies in raising or lowering the voice too much in
a style approaching to that of question and answer, in-
stead of keeping it nearly level.
The fault of sing-song reading is usually caused by
allowing the voice to drop at the end of the second line
of a stanza, instead of keeping it up till the proper ca.
dence at the close. Thus
“ There is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal rèign;
Eternal day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.”
There are two obvious reasons why the fall, or down-
ward slide, at the word “reign,” should not be used: 1st,
the sense is not independently completed there,
words and where are required, mentally, to fill up an ellip-
sis between the second and third lines of the stanza; 2d,
if the word “reign” is allowed the “downward slide,"
the corresponding rhyming word “pain ” having necessa-
rily the same “slide" at the cadence, a painful sameness
of melody is produced to the ear, as if the reader were,
in the last two lines of the stanza, repeating, in a mock-
ing tone, his own melody used in the first two.
The rule of appropriate intonation in stanza, is, Keep
the voice up, at the end of the second line, unless em-
phasis, or independent sense, or abrupt style authorizes
or requires a downward slide; and let the voice take a
lower pitch, at the beginning of the third line.
But the worst of all faults, the doggerel see-saw,
is that which is produced by throwing the voice up and
down alternately in the penultimate line of a stanza, -
and alternately down, up, and down again, in the last
line. Thus
“ Eternal dày excludes the night,
And pleasures bánish pain.”
The following exercises should be repeated till a per-
fect command of “expression" and "melody," is attained.

PRINCIPLES OF GESTURE.
Man, as a communicative and expressive being, natur-
ally imparts his states of thought and feeling by visible
as well as audible language. His corporeal organization
is adapted to this, among the other ends of his constitu-
tion. All vivid and powerful emotions of the human
breast, become legible, and are transmitted, by their ef-
fects on the features of the countenance, the attitude of
the body, and the actions of the arm and hand. This fact
is universally exhibited in the unconscious habits of child-
hood, and, with no less certainty, in those of manhood,
when under the influence of earnest feeling. We read
each other's inmost hearts in a glance of the eye, a quiver
of the features, a change of hue in the countenance, a
posture or a movement of the body, or a wave of the hand,
more surely than in any tone or expression of the voice.
It is but a superficial and narrow philosophy which leads
to the neglect of that ordination of Divine wisdom, by
which the law of language is written on man's exterior
frame, as distinctly as on his organs of speech; and few
among the numerous deficiencies of existing modes of
education, are greater, or more unfavorable to the free
and full development of the human being, than the gen-
eral omission of such culture and training as might yield
to every youth, and especially to those who are destined
to the sacred profession, the unspeakable advantages re-
sulting from a perfect command over all those natural and
appropriate aids to expressive utterance, which arise from
the cultivation of the eloquence of action.
Man expresses himself most naturally and most effec-

tively when he obeys the law of his constitution which
leads him to use his whole bodily frame as an organ of
communication. He becomes impressively eloquent when
the breathing thoughts come "beaming from the eye," as
well as “speaking on the tongue,” and “urge the whole
man onward:”
Our conventional modes of life, which quench or sup-
press expression, by withholding corporeal action, - the
natural accompaniment of speech, — are as faulty, in
point of true taste, as they are false to nature.
condition of eloquence in address, is, that we become
sufficiently exalted by thought and emotion, to rise above
such habits, and to give sentiment an expression and a
character to the eye, as well as to the ear. Undisciplined
habit may, it is true, carry this, as any other mode of ex-
pression, to excess. But the theory which founds on this
fact a sweeping objection to the use of action in speaking,
is not at all more rational than would be that which should
enjoin abstinence from aliment, on the ground of the ten-
dency of ungoverned appetite to excess in eating and
drinking
Genuine culture would prescribe in this, as in other de-
partments of expression, a strict guard against faults of
excess, no less anxiously than it would solicit and cherish
the power and the beauty of appropriate and proportioned
action.
Another current error on this subject of gesture, is, that
it is a thing not capable of being reduced to study or sys-
tematic practice, that it is a pure result of unconscious
impulse, and beyond the search of the understanding.
So was musical sound thought to be, till man had the
patience to observe it attentively, and trace its relations
and its principles. Faithful observation of phenomena
and effects, was the condition on which the beautiful, the
profound science of music was constructed, and in conse-
quence of which it became a definite and intelligible art,
involving processes of systematic execution.


## p. 348 (#382) ############################################

PULPIT ELOCUTION.
All expressive arts have a common groundwork of
principles. Patient application discovers and defines
these, and embodies them in rules. Study and practice
follow, in due order; and the result is a recognized form
of beauty or of power. Depth, breadth, force, truth, and
grace, are each the same thing, in whatever art; be it
architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry, or oratory.
The mind which submits to the requisite conditions of
patient and skillful investigation, will succeed in finding,
and naming, and exemplifying them.
The great impediment to effective speaking, so far as
depends on action, lies in the defective character of early
education. The child is originally a model and a study
for the sculptor and the painter, in the spontaneous per-
fection of attitude and gesture. Education, as generally
conducted, does nothing to secure this natural excellence;
but, on the contrary, allows it to die out of use, and even
displaces it by a defective routine of mechanical habit.
The awkwardness of the schoolboy, and the stiffness of
the student, are proverbial. The minister in the pulpit,
naturally, - we might almost say necessarily, - exhibits
the habitual faults of the student, to their fullest extent.
His modes of life, if not counteracted by express care and
due self-cultivation, lead him to a cold, reserved, ineffec-
tive, inexpressive style of action. So much so, that noth-
ing is more frequently or more generally a subject of pop-
ular remark, than the coldness and the lifelessness of the
style of speaking usually exemplified in the pulpit. In
too many cases, the sacred precincts seem to be occupied
by an automaton or a statue, endowed with nothing be-
yond the power of a mechanical articulation.
The opposite faults of excessive, redundant, or over
vehement action, and of labored or fanciful gesticulation,
instead of a just and manly style of gesture, are the una-
idable results of an injudicious reaction against the
ets of early neglect. Judgment and taste must dis-
rge their salutary office here as elsewhere; and for

the discipline of these controlling faculties education
ought to be held responsible. The present order of affairs
devolves this duty on the individual; and when we ad-
vert to the fact that, in addresses from the pulpit, more
than in any other form of speaking, every look and action
has an immediate and, perhaps, an abiding effect of the
deepest moral character, and of the utmost moment to the
objects of the sacred office, the duty of self-culture in this
branch of eloquence, becomes inexpressibly important to
all who are already occupied in that sphere of professional
usefulness, or who are expecting to be so.
The study of that branch of elocution which consists of
the visible effects of attitude and action, is sometimes er-
roneously suffered to settle down into an analysis of the
mere details of gesture, and the application of arbitrary
rules for the motions and postures of the body. Such
study, it is hardly necessary to say, is worse than none,
as it leads to artificial and mechanical style. Empirical
directions and manual exercise, may accidentally take a
right shape, in some instances, and aid in breaking up
awkward tendencies of habit. But they may also take a
wrong shape, and lead to the worst results of glaring im-
propriety. Genuine cultivation can be built on no other
foundation than that of principles; and, as regards ges-
ture, the principles of effect, if they are just and true,
must, as was mentioned before, be identical with those
of all other forms of expressive art.
The leading characteristics of expression, in whatever
form we contemplate it, are, in the first place, perfect truth,
or correspondence to nature, as opposed to whatever is
factitious. Referring to this department of the subject,
the student derives the important practical lesson, that
all forms of action are faulty, which are merely the vari-
ous phases of national, local, or personal and constitu-
tional habit, and do not spring from the sentiment to the
utterance of which they are applied. Under this head
elocution classes the superabundant shrugs and grimaces

of French and Italian custom, the absence of action or
the hammering gesture which mark the Englishman, the
uncouth gestures of the Scotchman, the narrow, frigid,
and angular action of the New Englander, the oratorical
display of our Southern and the grotesque style of our
Western speakers.
The whole array of artificial faults of studied manner,
falls under the same general classification of violations of
truth and nature.
The second prominent principle of oratorical action, is
force. Weakness, in any
form of attitude or action, we
may pardon to woman, but we cannot to man: his prime
natural attribute is force; and to that native trait we can
pardon the absence of nearly every other quality; while
its opposite can only produce a feeling of indifference or
contempt. The vehemence of Chalmers, and the very
violence of Irving, pass with slight censure, in the judg-
ment of even critical observers, because the energy of
soul which action such as theirs bespeaks, is irresistible.
It becomes, in fact, an element of indescribable power.
But faults such as these can be pardoned in such men
only. The habitual athletic displays in which some of
our own public speakers, even in the pulpit, allow them-
selves, savor too much of brute force, for any deep and
permanent effect on the soul.
The third requisite in the position and movements of
the body, as connected with public speaking, is entire
freedom, — not negligence or nonchalance, not a vulgar
familiarity of personal habit; all of which are so repulsive
to feeling, and so inappropriate in the pulpit, — yet un-
fortunately too prevalent; but that exemption from con-
straint and embarrassment, which is inseparable from
manly energy and self-possession. What a correct elo-
cution demands, is the dignity arising from repose and
serenity of manner. The posture and the motions of the
body and the action of the arm, when regulated by this
principle, are freed from all confining or constraining nar-

rowness and littleness of effect; the attitude is easy and
therefore graceful; the action, liberal and flowing in its
style. Nothing is more indicative of the perfect mechan-
ism of the human frame, than the ease with which its
members combine to perform any movement or action,
even the most complex and apparently difficult.
The confined mode of the student's life, subjects him
to a degree of muscular feebleness incompatible with
freedom of action in the body and limbs. Nor do the
limited forms of mechanical exercise or manual labor,
even when habitually resorted to, prove an adequate pre-
ventive. The tendency of these modes of exertion, is,
from the habitual reïteration of one action, which they all
imply, unfavorable to the free use of the body, with that
unity and wholeness of effect which an oratorical action
demands, as contrasted with the style of one which is
mechanical. The recreative exercises of a student whose
subsequent life is to be occupied with the business of
public speaking, should be free and varied, so as to im-
part pliancy as well as force to the body and limbs. Ac-
tive and enlivening sports have in all ages,
community, been recognized as an important aid to man's
physical culture. Health and animation demand these
as an indispensable condition of their existence, and of
no class more urgently than of thé sedentary and the
studious, but particularly of students of theology, who are
so prone to subside into inactive and enfeebling habits, -
the greatest of all obstacles to free and effective speaking.
Next, in importance, as an element of oratorical effect,
is the principle of adaptation, — the moulding of external
manner and action, in consistency with the character of
the subject of address, the mode of thought, and the style
of language. This department of elocution is that in
which, as a man of cultivated mind and accordant habit,
the preacher should be comparatively perfect. Yet his
daily habits incline him more than other speakers, to be
uniform and monotonous, and to relinquish his style to
and in every

the mere mechanism of habit and routine. The power
of adapting manner to matter, is one which, of course,
depends on taste and judgment, and on a culture co-ex-
tensive with the whole broad field of criticism, as invol-
ving the philosophy of expression.
It is much to be regretted that this subject receives so
little attention during the progress of education, and that
a thoroughly æsthetic discipline is not a part of the course
pursued at all our public institutions for mental culture.
The best possible school of instruction, in every depart-
ment of oratory, but particularly that of gesture, would
be a liberal and effectual education with reference to
the constituent elements of expression, on the common
grounds of nature and art, but directed specifically to the
forms of speech and writing. The modicum of attention
assigned to such subjects, on our present plans of instruc-
tion, is utterly inadequate to the purpose of creating a
sound and just taste, even in regard to language.
The student of theology needs, more than any other,
the aid of such cultivation. But, at present, it must be
the fruit of his own nearly unaided application; for our
language furnishes but very few works of reference on
such topics; and such as we have are merely elemen-
tary, and many of them extremely defective. The per-
sonal study of nature and of art, with a view to the de-
tection and recognition of the principles of expression,
has, frequently in these pages, been suggested as the
student's best resort for guidance as to the formation of
manner and habit in speaking; and, for the present, it
may suffice to reïterate the hint. Appropriateness of
manner can be learned only from those analogies which
reveal themselves to faithful observation in the great
schools of genuine nature and true art.
The results of such study are always legible in man-
ner. Appropriate action carries sentiment home to the
heart, with a power not second to that of the fitting word.
If the study of action as a part of eloquence, has, in our

day, fallen into discredit, the fact is owing to the general
tendency of modern mind. We suffer our modes of men-
tal action to be narrowed down to the standard of a taste
which is usurped by the influence of man's external con-
dition and relations. We lose, accordingly, the benefits
of that wider action of the mind which should stretch be-
yond such limitations, and aspire to a nobler aim. Our
discipline of man, as a being capable of varied action, is
altogether inferior, in extent and living power, to that
which was the standard of former times. The Grecian
culture had a truer regard than ours, to man as a being
designed to exert an influence on man. A liberal educa-
tion derives no small share of its value from the light
which it sheds on this fact, and on the path of the stu-
dent's duty to himself in personal cultivation.
All these, and innumerable other considerations of sim-
ilar tendency, become doubly impressive when we advert
to the next prominent characteristic of gesture, as a part
of expression, - grace. This trait, it is true, can be more
easily dispensed with, than any of the others which have
been mentioned. It is one, confessedly, of inferior mo-
ment. We may justly require, of every public speaker,
a manly force and freedom in his demeanor and action;
we may justly require of every speaker, even of limited
opportunities, the judgment which enables him to avoid
incongruities of voice and gesture. But grace is a feature
of eloquence which belongs to comparatively high culture
and refinement. Still, even this we have a right to ex-
pect of the man of liberal education. To what end,
otherwise, were all his classical studies, with their perfect
models of expressive art, their atmosphere of elegance,
their presiding muses, and attendant graces?
If there is anything which more than another displays
the incompetent manner in which classical culture is gen-
erally conducted, as to its effect on the mind, it is the
case of a man who, as a scholar, appreciates every shade
of beauty in a sentence of Cicero or a turn of Horace,

who hangs with a species of idolatry over a single epithet
in Homer, or a line in Euripides, who throws his whole
soul into the force of an interrogation in Demosthenes,
but who addresses his fellow-men on the themes of duty
and immortality, with a half-stretched angular arm, which,
under other circumstances, the eye would recognize as
the style of paralysis or deformity, and who shortens even
the proverbial step from the sublime to the ridiculous, by
uttering the former with his tongue, and, at the same mo-
ment, exhibiting the latter with his hand.
A graceful style of speaking, so far as regards the visi-
ble part of oratory, resolves itself into a compliance with
the natural laws of form and motion, which preserve
curved and waving lines, with free and flowing move-
ments, as contrasted with straight lines and angles, ac-
companied by narrow, abrupt, and jerking motions.
Every action of the arm, however, depends, for its true
effect, on the condition that the body is self-balanced and
reposing, not stooping, leaning, wavering, lounging, or re-
clining. Hence, attention is due, in the first place, to the
posture of the body, that it be firm and free, appropriate,
and, at least negatively, graceful. The student's first
point of attention, in personal training, is, accordingly,
THE ATTITUDE OF THE BODY, REQUIRED FOR PUB-
LIC SPEAKING.
This point is, by some speakers, assumed as a thing
that requires no special attention, and which may be
safely left to nature or to accident. Hence the preva-
lence of those stooping, lounging, and leaning postures
which are not only ungainly and awkward to the eye of
observers, but injurious to the organs of the speaker, in
consequence of the false position in which they place the
trunk of the body, and necessarily the chest and lungs.

as a con-
lungs, and the easy action of the air-cells, the bronchial
tubes, the larynx, the vocal ligaments, and the glottis. A
stooping, or lounging, or bent attitude causes a partial
sinking and narrowing of the chest, an unnatural and in-
jurious position of the whole breathing and vocal appara-
tus, attended by a stifled and imperfect sound of the voice,
a sense of exhaustion, and, perhaps, immediate pain; to
all which are probably added, in due season,
sequence of the violation of the natural laws of vocal
sound, connected with respiration, - the successive stages
of bronchial disease.
A faulty attitude of body usually leads, nioreover, to
awkward motions of the whole frame. The speaker who
stands with bent knees, necessarily inclines to a courtsey-
ing motion of the limbs, and a swaying notion of the
back, which becomes peculiarly noticeable, if, as is usu-
ally the case, the courtseys and the half-bows keep time
to a rhythmical gesture of the arm.
A true, firm, and easy attitude, depends on the weight
of the body being supported on one foot and limb, firmly
planted, while the other foot and limb are at rest, and
support their own weight merely: the feet at a moderate
distance ;* the onet in advance of the other, and the toes
pointing moderately outward. This is the natural atti.
tude of firmness and freedom combined. The common
faults of attitude are standing with the feet feebly drawn
close to each other, or the opposite error of standing as-
tride; the legs both sinking, or both braced, at the knees;
- the former causing a feeble, the latter, a stiff and rigid
posture; while firmness demands that one knee be brac-
ed, and freedom, that the other should be slightly bent

tion of the trunk, which, on the contrary, should yield and
incline slightly on the side that does not, for the moment,
support the weight of the body. Still another fault is
that of bending forward too much; a gentle inclination of
the speaker's body towards those whom he is addressing,
being all that is requisite. The position of the head is
often faultily submissive and drooping, or haughtily erect;
propriety lying between these extremes. An awkward
effect is often produced on the general attitude of the
body, in consequence of placing the feet directly forward,
or, perhaps, even with the toes pointing inward. The
consequence of this slight error, is, that the speaker's
whole attitude resembles that of a fencer in attack, rather
than of one man addressing others in the spirit of amity
and conciliation. Awkwardness is to be shunned, not
merely because it is unseemly, but because whatever is
so, is repulsive and offensive, and hinders the speaker's
access to the heart. Awkwardness, it is true, is no crime;
but its tendency is to provoke mirth in the thoughtless,
and pity in the reflective portion of an audience. By no
possibility can a speaker who has the misfortune to ex-
hibit such a trait, produce an appropriate effect on the
mind, as regards the subject of his address. Yet our na-
tional negligence as to manner, causes too general a ten-
dency to habits of the description to which we here refer.
Five minutes' instruction or direction might, in many in-
stances, have sufficed seasonably to remove such defects
from the juvenile elocution of the speaker; but habit
has, perhaps, now made them inseparable parts of him-
self.
But it is not only early neglect that is the source of nu-
merous errors of manner in speaking. The inadequate
attention given, by teachers themselves, to this depart-
ment of education, renders their instruction sometimes er-
roneous. The pupils of some of our academies are actu- .
ally directed to cultivate the ungainly habit of speaking
with the left foot advanced while the right hand is in ac-

tion,
a misfortune which the Roman orator had to un-
dergo, in consequence, partly, of the necessity of holding
up on his left arm the burden of his unweildy toga, while
engaged in speaking, and, partly, from the analogy of
such a position to the manly attitude of the ancient sol.
dier, with his left foot advanced, in inevitable correspon-
dence to the act of protecting his body by advancing his
left arm, on which the shield was worn. The use of such
an attitude, in modern oratory, throws over the speaker's
whole mien the air of an artisan at the anvil, whose ob,
ject it is to bring down a blow from the greatest practica-
ble height and distance.
The custom of some of our academic institutions pre-
scribes to the student the habit of standing with both feet
flat on the floor, and without the aid to easy and graceful
attitude which comes from the slight raising of the heel
of the retired foot, when the weight of the body is sup-
ported on the advanced one. The consequences of this
error, slight as it may seem, are the raising of one shoul-
der, and the stiffening of the whole attitude of the body,
- one of the most prominent and glaring faults with
which our New England students are generally chargea-
ble, in the act of declaiming.
Another very common error in the attitude of New
England speakers, and one which is, in some instances,
enjoined by erroneous instruction, is the habit of standing
in the square attitude of the Indian, or of the English
ploughman, with the feet pointing directly forward from
the body. An inevitable consequence of this error, is,
that whenever the speaker advances, in the animation of
energetic address, his false line of position in the foot,
swings round his shoulder to his audience, so that he has
then the attitude, precisely, of a fencer in attack. Another
bad result of this fault in position and movement, is, that
it inclines the speaker to the habit of frequently turning
his side to the body of his audience, and addressing now
a

one portion, on the right, then another, on the left, to the
exclusion of the majority.*
The slight attention necessary to point the toes out-
ward, enables the speaker, by the easy and natural iurn
of the head, to address his whole audience, and keep
them constantly in his eye, and by the law of natural
sympathy, to secure their uninterrupted attention, by di-
recting his eye to theirs, — not at intervals, but continu.
ally; not now to one part of the congregation, and then
to another; but to all successively: the speaker's atten-
tion being due to the whole assembly equally. This in-
dispensable condition of appropriate address, is necessa-
rily dependent on the position of the foot; as on it the
whole attitude of the body is founded.
The mode of changing the bodily attitude, is another of
those points of practical oratory, which need much atten-
tion from the student. The bad effects of neglected
habit, are very generally apparent in this particular. One
speaker shifts his position with a bold stride; another,
with a timid and shuffling slide; one slips or glides to
one side, when he ought to advance; another points his
foot directly forward, which throws him into the shoulder-
ing attitude already described; some stand as motionless
as statues, through a whole address; others are perpetu-
ally shifting their place without cause; and others, again,
make every change of posture a formal and laborious
operation.
Changes of attitude ought to be made either for the

* Austin, in his elaborate and eloquent work, Chironomia, quotes, in
this connection, the following apposite description of an awkward
speaker, as given from personal observation, by Cresollius, in his trea-
tise on oratory. — “When he turned himself to the left, he spoke a few
words accompanied by a moderate gesture of the hand; then, bending
to the right, he acted the same part over again; then, back again to the
left, and presently to the right, almost at an equal and measured inter-
val of time, he worked himself up to his usual gesture, and his one kind
of movement: you could compare him only to the blindfolded Babylo-
rian ox going forward and returning back by the same path.”

effect of quietness and repose, as a natural relief, at the
end of a bold passage of earnest address, or for force of
emphasis in an energetic assertion or a warm appeal.
The former is properly a quiet retiring movement, made
at the close of a paragraph or head of discourse, or at the
beginning of such a portion of an address, when the lan-
guage is less intense than in the strain immediately pre-
ceding it: the latter is a spirited advance, made during
the act of speaking, and in strict time with the emphasis
of the voice and the gesture of the arm.
In either case,
the movement is not obtrusive but is merged in the gen-
eral effect. The frequency of change in attitude should
always be left dependent on the comparative quietness
or animation of the composition to which the speaker is
giving utterance: the former style requires few, the latter
may require many changes; - the former, retiring; the
latter, advancing movements.
THE CHARACTER OF ORATORICAL ACTION.
The prevalent neglect of speaking, as an art, causes
many great errors of habit in early life, which continue
unremoved in subsequent stages. Among these, the
mode of using the hand is conspicuous. The analogy on
which the hand is used in oratory, is that of imparting,
giving, or bestowing; as speaking is the audible and visi-
ble impartation or communication of sentiment. The
analogy, in detail, is that of delivering an object, -as, for
example, a ball, into the hand of another. Such an act
requires an open and sloping position of the hand, and a
slight parting of the two outer fingers from the two mid-
dle ones, as the necessary condition of giving.
The suggestion hence arising to the student, is that
every position of the hand which holds it crooked, or
level, or flat, or inclined upward, or which keeps the
fingers confined, is inappropriate, because inconsistent
with giving, imparting, or communicating. The recipient

holds out a hollow hand, with crooked, or bent fingers :
the giver opens and slopes his hand, and partially sepa-
rates the outer fingers from the others, as mentioned. The
speaker who appeals to our feelings, expands his hand,
as the natural expression of appeal or of entreaty, in the
spirit of free and persuasive communication.
Yet how often we see the hand of the speaker held out
flat and close, like a piece of board, or edgewise, like a
chopping knife, or feebly hollowed, like that of a beggar,
receiving alms. Sometimes, on the contrary, we see it
clinched in a style which calls up the associations of
“strife and debate,” and “smiting with the fist of wicked-
ness."
The palm, (the seat of the great expansion of the sym-
pathetic nerve,) has in it a most eloquent natural lan-
guage.
It is to the hand what the countenance is to the
head, the seat of expression. The free opening, then, of
the hand, is one of the primary conditions of visible elo.
quence.*
The use of the arm, in oratorical action, is another
practical point of great moment to the right effect of ad-
dress. The confined and angular movements of the arm,
which take place in the natural and appropriate gestures

quot motus habeant, cum pene ipsam verborum copiam persequantur.

The value attached, by the ancients, to the eloquence of the hand, as
an instrument of expression, is unequivocally intimated in the fact that
the whole art of elocution was comprehended under the term Xtupovo-
KELO.

of the parlor or the study, when the persons who are ad-
dressed are seated near to the speaker, are utterly inap-
plicable to the act of addressing a public assembly, in
which the speaker's action is to be directed, (if rightly
performed,) to the remotest not less than the nearest of
his audience. The larger space, in the latter instance,
demands larger scope for the arm in action, as certainly
as it demands the full tone of voice used in public speak-
ing, and not the comparatively slight utterance used by
the fireside. The style of gesture, then, in public address,
requires a free action of the arm, terminating, usually, in
its full extension, in whatever line a sentiment prompts,
avoiding, however, such a degree of extension as termi-
nates in a rigidly straight line, which is always an offence
to the eye, as associated with a stiff or mechanical style
of action.
A prevalent fault of gesture, in the pulpit, is that of
allowing it to fall habitually in a line drawn from the
speaker's side. This style of action might be applicable,
were all his audience placed in one long row at his right
hand. But as they are actually seated in front of him,
his hand, - if its action is to have any meaning, - should
-
be presented in front, and obliquely from his own body.
A horizontal sweep or swing of the arm, is the habitual
gesture of some pulpit orators. But this style belongs
only to descriptive effect, or to that of negation or re-
moval, while assertion, the prevalent mood of speaking,
-
demands a downward movement of the arm, more or
less direct according to the form of a sentiment. The
horizontal line of action is that which properly terminates
the expression of general ideas, as coïncident in character
with the expansive horizontal sweep of the eye, in an
extensive view; for the phenomena of gesture are analo-
gous, in their influence on imagination, to the effect of
ocular action on external objects, and on visible motion:
hence the energetic character of the descent of the arm, in
a strong assertion, the expansive effect of a wide horizon-

a
tal motion, the elevation and sublimity associated with
lofty or ascending gesture, the direct character of an ac-
tion which throws the speaker's arm in front, the wider
effect of an oblique line outward, the still wider of the
line extended from the side, the association of remoteness
in time or place, which accompanies a gesture directed
obliquely backward from the body, the appealing effect
of the open hand, the threatening and intimidating or the
determined effect of the clinched hand, the marked sig.
nificance of the pointing finger, the repellant character of
the extended arm and opposing hand, the solemn or im-
pressive effect of the upraised hand of awe, wonder, grief,
joy, adoration; the supplicating effect of the clasped hands,
the welcoming and appealing power of the outspread
arms, the triumphant and exulting style of the wave of
the hand.
A fault exhibited by some speakers, consists in a cease-
less motion of the arms. The true principle of gesture is
that of applying the ictus of the arm along with the em-
phasis of the voice, and reserving the consummation of
an action till that moment.
Another error is that of keeping the arms habitually
down by the side, and, at long intervals, bringing them
up in action, or that of perpetually raising and dropping
the arms, at short intervals. The proper regulation of
action is founded on the principle that the hand should
remain at the point to which it was brought by the move-
ment of the preceding gesture, till occasion call for the
preparation requisite to a new action, and that the drop-
ping of the hand should be reserved for the completion
or termination of a sentiment, and should be the visible
indication that a pause of considerable length is about to
take place.
On the obvious fault of speaking without action, it is
unnecessary to enlarge. Such a mode of address can be
natural only in cases influenced by the second nature of
a habit of morbid reserve, or of a constitutional coldness,

363
which disqualifies a man for the offices of eloquence.
The frequency of gesture is properly dependent on tlie
character of sentiment and style. An essay, or a lecture,
or a merely doctrinal or didactic sermon, may require
comparatively little action; as the themes of such dis-
courses address themselves to the understanding and the
reason, and can derive little aid from suggestive or de-
scriptive gesture. An argumentative discourse may, from
its earnestness of feeling, require frequent and strong
gesture of the direct and downward character. Poetic
description and glowing appeal may need continual and
varied action, in coincidence with the natural demands of
feeling and imagination. The spirit of a just criticism, -
that which regards eloquence, and every constituent of
eloquence, as the expression of the man, and not of the
mere artist, - will always permit the vexed question of
the proper frequency of gesture to be decided, in part, by
the temperament and tendency of the individual. The
active and the ardent cannot speak earnestly without a
comparative copiousness of action. Their style of lan-
guage, indeed, if true to their nature, is such as tu de-
mand it: they incline to impressive moods of feeling and
forms of imagination, as we perceive by their figurative
modes of expression. Persons of a serene temper are
naturally moderate in gesture, as they are tranquil in
ihought. The reflective mind rather shuns external mani-
festation; and the phlegmatic constitution causes it, per-
haps, to seem unnecessary and superfluous. The morbid
condition of any temperament, however, leads necessarily
to excess and disproportion; and critical objections to ac-
tion, not less than the violations of principle in modes of
gesture, are not unfrequently the fruits of an unhealthy
taste.
No influence is more unfriendly to a genial and appro-
priate development of habit, as regards action in speaking,
than that arbitrary criticism which makes one constitu-
tion, or one temperament, or one tendency, the rule for

а
all. One man may use but one or two gestures, in a
given paragraph; and his grave and reserved habit may
make his manner seem perfectly appropriate: another, of
more active tendencies, may double the number of ac-
tions, without seeming unnatural. Gesture resembles
emphasis: its force and frequency depend, in part, on
the personal habit, as well as the momentary feeling, of
the man.
A studied variety of oratorical action is an impediment
rather than an aid to good effect; as it detaches the at-
tention from the subject to the manner of the speaker,
and betrays a false conception of the nature of gesture,
which should ever be regarded but as a mode of giving
freer and truer vent to the heart. The influence of even
the profoundest study of the principles of gesture, should
be a thing unsolicited at the moment of speaking,
result on habit not a trick of art, - a thing of which the
speaker is himself, at the time, unconscious, but into
which he naturally falls by an intuitive and unstudied
effort of his mind. The act of speaking should ever pro-
ceed without one separate thought of elocution or of ges-
ture, or any other reference whatever to mere manner.
No tone of the voice, no action of the rm, can be true,
that is a distinct object of attention, apart from its prompt-
ing sentiment. Preparatory practice itself should ever be
conducted in the spirit of this unquestionable fact; and
such matter only should be selected for exercises, as pre-
sents thought in vivid and inspiring forms, – those which
naturally prompt or suggest the appropriate modes of ac-
companying action.
Gestures introduced merely because they are graceful,
constitute a class of faults which hardly requires notice,
even in the form of censure; the primary objec: and aim
of all true action being to enforce, not to decorate, senti-
nient. True grace is never other than incidental; it does
not exist apart from genuine earnestness.
Gestures which are mimetic, or' merely imitative of
a

365
outward effects, instead of being suggestive only, form
another of the class of puerile faults, which only perverted
taste or deficient judgment can prompt. Some speakers
plead for such modes of action, because of their graphic
and dramatic power, and their startling effect on rude and
uncultivated minds. But such practices, even in the
pulpit, cannot be cleared of the charge of pandering to
the low and the vile in taste, and of desecrating what the
human heart should ever regard as holy. The stare and
the laugh of unreflecting hearers, are a poor compensation
to the preacher, for the sacrifice of personal dignity, on
his own part, and of reverence for truth, on that of his
congregation.
The minor faults of gesture are chiefly the following:
Ill-timed action, which does not “keep time” with em-
phasis, but either runs before or lags after it; the frequent
use of the left hand in gesture; the incessant use of both
hands whether the breadth or the warmth of a sentiment
authorize it or not; using one or two gestures exclusively,
which are perpetually recurring to the eye; allowing ges-
tures to cross the speaker's body, or to terminate with a
rebound, in the pugnacious style of popular debate; the
frequent placing of the hand on the heart, when no per-
sonal feeling of the speaker is implied.
The character of gesture, in connection with the differ-
ent forms of discourse, as didactic or oratorical, was al-
luded to in a preceding page. Attention is due, also, to
the effect produced on gesture by the different parts of
the same discourse. Thus, the opening sentences, being
usually of an explanatory and didactic character, may
need little or no accompaniment of action; the illustra-
tive and argumentative portions of a sermon may justly
require a more animated and varied style of gesture; and
the concluding application, or appeal, may properly call
for the highest forms of poetic and oratorical eloquence,
in action as well as in language. A well-composed dis-
course may not happen to be constructed on such a plan

as literally to require these gradations of effect in manner.
But every well-written composition, and every well-spo.
ken address, are always progressive in character, and
leave on the mind the impression of a climax of senti-
ment and style.
The appropriate postures of devotion, are a subject on
which too little attention is commonly bestowed by the
occupants of the pulpit. The clasped hands, and the shut
eyes, and the bent body, are obviously not alike applica-
ble to all points of a devotional exercise. They have
nothing in common with the feelings which ought to per-
vade the bosom of the worshipper in the sublime and in-
spiring acts of adoration and praise: they do not belong
to intercession: they are appropriate only in confession
and supplication. Every strain of devotion has its appro-
priate tone, from the swelling notes of adoration and
praise, to the breathings of a broken and contrite spirit:
each of these, if it issues from the heart rather than from
habit, has its natural expression in posture and action :
the former prompts the erect attitude and the upraised
vertical hands of awe, reverence, and blessing; the latter,
the bent frame, the drooping head, and the folded hands
of self-abasement Supplication and entreaty raise the
head and clasp the hands in earnestness; petition and
intercession extend the arms in the mood and attitude of
reception; thanksgiving proffers the gratitude of the heart,
as a tribute at the throne of Mercy, with open hands, and
downward inclination of the arms, in front of the body. -
A very common error in the form of action adopted in the
benediction, at the close of public religious services,
makes the minister apparently solicit a favor of the con-
gregation, instead of presenting himself as, imploring a
blessing on them. The false effect arises from the hands
being held supine instead of prone, in the act.
The reading of the Scriptures and of hymns, is, in the
practice of some clergymen, accompanied by expressive
gesture. This habit seems to be founded on a mistake.

PRINCIPLES OF GESTURE.
367
The process
of elocution is, in both these cases, one of
strict reading, not of speaking. It is one which calls,
therefore, for audible, not visible expression. Such, at
least, is the association connected with the custom in
Anglo-Saxon communities, in most parts of the world.
The Oriental and the European continental style of read-
ing, with the full effect of gesture, is, perhaps, the truer
method, if we settle the question affirmatively that vivid
reading comes as near as possible to vivid speaking ; (and
we admit the principle so far as the management of the
voice is concerned ;) but the prevalence of general cus-
tom, with us, associates a subdued and repressed style
with the reverence due to the Bible and to the offices of
worship; and nothing but a singular ardor of tempera-
ment, and a recognized peculiarity of personal habit, can
render an opposite practice generally tolerable. In this,
however, as in other questions of expression, the natural
eloquence of strong feeling, is sometimes successful in
breaking through the usual restrains of custom.
The common distinctions of gesture, implied in the
terms“ didactic," "declamatory," and "poetic," may sug-
gest useful hints to the student, in connection with the
different modes of action appropriate in the delivery of a
discourse. “ Didactic” gestures include the slight uses
of the open hand and the discriminative finger, in moder-
ate emphasis; " declamatory" action implies the wide
”
sweep and bold descent of energetic emphasis; and “po-
etic" gesture includes the characteristic loftiness of epic
description, the empassioned vividness and fervor of lyric
emotion, and the graphic and abrupt effects of dramatic
style. A bigh-toned prose composition may demand, in
delivery, the use of all these forms of action; as its mat-
ter and its style may partake of all the corresponding
characteristics of effect.
The genuine eloquence of inspired feeling, acknowl-
edges no arbitrary limitations. But the subduing and

chastening influences of judgment and taste, ought to

Elocutionist, will furnish to students more extensive in-

subject; and Austin's Chironomia, (copies of which are

tions,) will be found to contain a fund of information upon
it, enriched by every aid of learned research and graphic

[This and a few of the following pieces may be read as examples of di-
dactic style. But they are introduced thus early on account, chiefly,
of their suggestive character, as regards the formation of style in read-
ing and speaking.)
Most foreign writers, who have given any character of
the English nation, whatever vices they ascribe to it,
allow, in general, that the people are naturally modest.
It proceeds, perhaps, from this our national virtue, that
our orators are observed to make use of less gesture or
action than those of other countries. Our preachers stand
stock still in the pulpit, and will not so much as move a
finger to set off the best sermons in the world. We meet
with the same speaking statues at our bars, and in all
public places of debate. Our words flow from us in ;
smooth, continued stream, without those strainings of the
voice, motions of the body, and majesty of the hand,
which are so much celebrated in the orators of Greece
and Rome, We can talk of life and death in cold blood,
and keep our temper in a discourse which turns upon
everything that is dear to us. Though our zeal breaks
out in the finest tropes and figures, it is not able to stir a
limb about us.

have seen Italy, that an untravelled Englishman cannot

relish all ihe beauties of Italian pictures, because the pos-
tures which are expressed in them are often such as are
peculiar to that country. One who has not seen an Ital-
ian in the pulpit, will not know what to make of that
noble gesture in Raphael's picture of St. Paul preaching
at Athens, where the apostle is represented as lifting up
both his arms, and pouring out the thunder of his rhetoric
amidst an audience of pagan philosophers.
It is certain, that proper gestures, and powerful exer-
tions of the voice, cannot be too much studied by a pub-
lic orator. They are a kind of comment to what he utters,
and enforce everything he says, with weak hearers, bet-
ter than the strongest argument he can make use of.
They keep the audience awake, and fix their attention to
what is delivered to them; at the same time that they
show the speaker is in earnest, and affected himself with
what he so passionately recommends to others.
We are told that the great Latin orator very much im.
paired his health by the vehemence of action, with which
he used to deliver himself, The Greek orator was like-
wise so very famous for this particular in rhetoric, that
one of his antagonists, whom he had banished from Ath-
ens, reading over the oration which had procured his ban-
ishment, and seeing his friends admire it, could not for-
bear asking them, if they were so much affected by the
bare reading of it, how much more they would have been
alarmed, had they heard him actually throwing out such
a storm of eloquence?
How cold and dead a figure, in comparison of these
two great men, does an orator often make at the British
bar! The truth of it is, there is often nothing more ridic-
ulous than the gestures of an English speaker; you see
some of them running their hands into their pockets as
far as ever they can thrust them, and others, looking with
eat attention on a piece of paper that has nothing writ-
on it; you may see many a smart rhetorician turn-
his hat in his hands, moulding it into several different

nation. I remember, when I was a young man, and user
to frequent Westminster Hall, there was a counsellor who
never pleaded without a piece of pack-thread in his hand,
which he used to twist about a thumb or a finger, all the
while he was speaking: the wags of those days used iu
call it “the thread of his discourse;" for he was not able
to utter a word without it. One of his clients, who was
more merry than wise, stole it from him, one day, in the
midst of his pleading; but he had better have let it alone,
for he lost his cause by his jest.
I have all along acknowledged myself to be a dumb
man, and therefore may be thought a very improper per-
son to give rules for oratory; but I believe every one will
agree with me in this, that we ought either to lay aside
all kinds of gesture, (which seems to be very suitable to
the genius of our nation,) or at least to make use of such
only as are graceful and expressive.
PULPIT ELOQUENCE OF ENGLAND. — Sydney Smith.
We have no modern sermons in the English language
that can be considered as very eloquent. The merits of
Blair, (by far the most popular writer of sermons within
the last century,) are plain good sense, a happy applica-
tion of scriptural quotation, and a clear, harmonious style,
richly tinged with scriptural language. He generally
leaves his readers pleased with his judgment, and his just
observations on human conduct, without ever rising so high
as to touch the great passions, or kindle any enthusiasm
in favor of virtue. For eloquence, we must ascend as high
as the days of Barrow and Jeremy Taylor: and even
there, while we are delighted with their energy, their co-
piousness, and their fancy, we are in danger of being

suffocated by a redundance which abhors all discrimina-
tion: which compares till it perplexes, and illustrates till
it confounds.
To the oäses of Tillotson, Sherlock, and Atterbury, we
must wade through many a barren page, in which the
weary Christian can descry nothing all around him but a
dreary expanse of trite sentiments and languid words.
The great object of modern sermons, is to hazard noth-
ing: their characteristic is, decent debility; which alike
guards the authors from ludicrous errors, and precludes
them from striking beauties. Every man of sense, in
taking up an English sermon, expects to find it a tedious
essay, full of common-place morality; and if the fulfil-
ment of such expectations be meritorious, the clergy have
certainly the merit of not disappointing their readers. Yet
it is curious to consider, how a body of men so well edu-
cated, and so magnificently endowed as the English cler-
gy, should distinguish themselves so little in a species of
composition to which it is their peculiar duty, as well as
their ordinary habit to attend.
To solve this difficulty, it should be remembered, that
the eloquence of the Bar and of the Senate force them-
selves into notice, power, and wealth, that the penalty
which an individual client pays for choosing a bad advo-
cate, is the loss of his cause, - that a prime minister
must infallibly suffer in the estimation of the public, who
neglects to conciliate the eloquent men, and trusts the
defence of his measures to those who have not adequate
talents for that purpose: whereas, the only evil which
accrues from the promotion of a clergyman to the pulpit,
which he has no ability to fill as he ought, is the fatigue
of the audience, and the discredit of that species of pub-
lic instruction; an evil so general, that no individual pa-
tron would dream of sacrificing to it his particular interest.
The clergy are generally appointed to their situations by
those who have no interest that they should please the
audience before whom they speak; while the very re-

verse is the case in the eloquence of the Bar, and of Par-
liament. We by no means would be understood to say,
that the clergy should owe their promotion principally to
their eloquence, or that eloquence ever could, consistently
with the constitution of the English church, he made out
a common cause of preferment. In pointing out the total
want of connection between the privilege of preaching,
and the power of preaching well, we are giving no opin-
ion as to whether it might, or might not be remedied; but
merely stating a fact.
Pulpit discourses have insensibly dwindled from speak-
ing to reading; a practice, of itself, sufficient to stifle
every germ of eloquence. It is only by the fresh feelings
of the heart, that mankind can be very powerfully affected.
What can be more ludicrous, than an orator delivering
stale indignation, and fervor of a week old; turning over
whole pages of violent passions, written out in goodly
text; reading the tropes and apostrophes into which he is
hurried by the ardor of his mind; and so affected at a
preconcerted line, and page, that he is unable to proceed
any farther?
The prejudices of the English nation have proceeded
a good deal from their hatred to the French; and because
that country is the native soil of elegance, animation, and
grace, a certain patriotic solidity, and loyal awkardness,
have become the characteristics of this; so that an ad-
venturous preacher is afraid of violating the ancient tran-
quillity of the pulpit; and the audience are commonly
apt to consider the man who tires them less than usual,
as a trifler, or a charlatan.
Of British Education, the study of eloquence makes
little or no part. The exterior graces of a speaker are
despised; and debating societies, (admirable institutions,
under proper regulations,) would hardly be tolerated
either at Oxford or Cambridge. It is commonly answered
to any animadversions upon the eloquence of the English
pulpit, that a clergyman is to recommend himself, not by

his eloquence, but by the purity of his life, and the sound-
ness of his doctrine; an objection good enough, if any
connection could be pointed out between eloquence, her-
esy, and dissipation; but if it is possible for a man to live
well, preach well, and teach well, at the same time, such
objections, resting only upon a supposed incompatibility
of these good qualities, are duller then the dulness they
defend.
The clergy are apt to shelter themselves under the
plea, that subjects so exhausted are utterly incapable of
novelty; and, in the very strictest sense of the word nov-
elty, - meaning that which was never said before, at any
time, or in any place, this may be true enough of the first
principles of morals; but the modes of expanding, illus-
trating, and enforcing a particular theme, are capable of
infinite variety.
ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT. — John Quincy Adams.
The pulpit is especially the throne of modern elo.
quence. There it is, that speech is summoned to realize
the fabled wonders of the orphean lyre. The preacher
has no control over the will of his audience, other than
the influence of his discourse. Yet, as the ambassador
of Christ, it is his great and awful duty to call sinners to
repentance. His only weapon is the voice; and with
this, he is to appal the guilty, and to reclaim the infidel;
to rouse the indifferent, and to shame the scorner. He is
to inflame the lukewarm, to encourage the timid, and to
cheer the desponding believer. He is to pour the healing
balm of consolation, into the bleeding heart of sorrow, and
to soothe, with celestial hope, the very agonies of death.
Now tell me, who is it, that will best possess and most
effectually exercise these more than magic powers? Who
is it, that will most effectually stem the torrent of human
passions, and calm the raging waves of human vice and
folly? Who is it, that with the voice of a Joshua, shall

control the course of nature herself, in the perverted
heart, and arrest the luminaries of wisdom and virtue, in
their rapid revolutions round this little world of man? Is
it the cold and languid speaker, whose words fall in such
sluggish and drowsy motion from his lips, that they can
promote nothing but the slumbers of his auditory, and
administer opiates to the body, rather than stimulants to
the soul? Is it the unlettered fanatic, without method,
without reason; with incoherent raving, and vociferous
ignorance, calculated to fit his hearers, not for the king-
dom of heaven, but for an hospital of lunatics? Is it even
the learned, ingenious, and pious minister of Christ, who,
by neglect or contempt of the oratorical art, has contracted
a whining, monotonous, sing-song of delivery, to exercise
the patience of his flock, at the expense of their other
Christian graces ?
Or is it the genuine orator of heaven, with a heart sin.

versal knowledge, required as the foundation of his art:
with a genius for the invention, a skill for the disposition,
and a voice for the elocution of every argument to con-
vince, and of every sentiment to persuade? If then we
admit, that the art of oratory qualifies the minister of the
gospel to perform, in higher perfection, the duties of his
station, we can no longer question whether it be proper
for his cultivation. It is more than proper; it is one of
his most solemn and indispensable duties.

melancholy tale of which the following passage is the
conclusion. – Vernon, is a clergyman in Westmoreland,
whose youngest son, at a distance from home, had, in a
moment of passion, committed murder. The youth had
been condemned and executed for his crime. But his
brothers had kept the cause
ind form of his death con-
cealed from their father, and had informed him that their
brother had been taken suddenly ill, and died on his road
homeward. The father hears the awful truth under the
following circumstances, when on a journey.
The coach stopped at an inn outside the city of York;
and as Vernon was not disposed to eat any dinner, he
strolled along the road, till he came to a small church,
pleasantly situated, and entered the church-yard to read,
as was his custom, the inscriptions on the tombstones.
While thus engaged, he saw a man filling up a new-made
grave, and entered into conversation with him. He found
it was the sexton himself; and he drew from him several
anecdotes of the persons interred around them.
During their conversation, they had walked over the
whole of the ground, when, just as they were going to
leave the spot, the sexton stopped to pluck some weeds
from a grave near the corner of it, and Vernon stopped
also; taking hold, as he did so, of a small willow sapling,
planted near the corner itself.
As the man rose from his occupation, and saw where
Vernon stood, he smiled significantly, and said, "I planted
that willow; and it is on a grave, though the grave is not
marked out.”
“ Indeed!”
Yes; it is the grave of a murderer.”
“ Of a murderer!” – echoed Vernon, instinctively shud-
dering, and moving away from it:
“ Yes,” resumed he, “of a murderer who was hanged
at York. Poor lad! - it was very right that he should be
hanged; but he was not a hardened villain! and he died
so penitent! and as I knew him when he used to visit

where I was groom, I could not help planting this tree
for old acquaintance' sake." —Here he drew his hand
across his eyes.
Then he was not a low-born man?”
“Oh! no; his father was a clergyman, I think.”
Indeed! poor man: was he living at the time?” said
Vernon, deeply sighing.
• Oh! yes; for his poor son did so fret, lest his father
should ever know what he had done: he said he was an
angel upon earth; and he could not bear to think how he
would grieve; for, poor lad, he loved his father and his
mother too, though he did so badly.”
Is his mother living ?”
No; if she had, he would have been alive; but his
evil courses broke her heart; and it was because the
man he killed reproached him for having murdered his
mother, that he was provoked to murder him.”
"Poor, rash, mistaken youth! then he had provoca-
tion ?”
“Oh! yes; the greatest: but he was very sorry for
what he had done; and it would have done your heart
good to hear him talk of his
poor
father.”
“I am glad I did not hear him,” said Vernon hastily,
and in a faltering voice; (for he thought of Edgar.)
“ And yet, sir, it would have done your heart good too.”
“ Then he had virtuous feelings, and loved his father,
amidst all his errors ?”
"Aye."
“And I dare say his father loved him, in spite of his
faults.”
I dare say he did,” replied the man; “ for one's chil-
dren are our own flesh and blood, you know, sir, after all
that is said and done; and may
be this
young
fellow was
spoiled in the bringing up."
"Perhaps so," said Vernon, sighing deeply.
“However, this poor lad made a very good end."
"I am glad of that! and he lies here,” continued Ver.

non, gazing on the spot with deeper interest, and moving
nearer to it as he spoke. « Peace be to his soul! but was
he not dissected ?”
Yes; but his brothers got leave to have the body
after dissection. They came to me, and we buried it
privately at night.”
His brothers came! and who were his brothers ?”
Merchants, in London; and it was a sad cut on them;
but they took care that their father should not know it.”
No!” cried Vernon, turning sick at heart.
“Oh! no; they wrote him word that his son was ill;
then went to Westmoreland, and —”
"Tell me," interrupted Vernon, gasping for breath, and
laying his hand on his arm, “tell me the name of this
poor youth!”
Why, he was tried under a false name, for the sake
of his family; but his real name was Edgar Vernon.”
The agonized parent drew back, shuddered violently
and repeatedly, casting up his eyes to heaven, at the
same time, with a look of mingled appeal and resignation.
He then rushed to the obscure spot which covered the
bones of his son, threw himself upon it, and stretched his
arms over it, as if embracing the unconscious deposit be-
neath, while his head rested on the grass, and he neither
spoke nor moved. But he uttered one groan;- then all
was stillness!
His terrified and astonished companion remained mo-
tionless, for a few moments, - then stooped to raise him;
but the FIAT OF MERCY had gone forth, and the paternal
heart, broken by the sudden shock, had suffered, and
breathed its last.

grave of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb
that ever he should have warred with the poor handful

assiduities, - the last testimonial of expiring love,- the

feeble, fluttering, thrilling -oh! how thrilling is the beat-
ing of the pulse! - the last fond look of the glazing eye,
turning upon us from the threshold of existence,

faint faltering accent, struggling in death to give one
more assurance of affection.
Ah! go to the grave of buried love, and meditate!
There settle the account, with thy conscience, of every
past endearment unregarded, of that departed being, who
never, never can be soothed by contrition. If thou art a
child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a fur-
row to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent;— if
thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom
that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms, to doubt a
moment of thy kindness or thy truth; - if thou art a
friend, and hast injured by thought, word, or deed, the
spirit that generously confided in thee;- if thou art a
lover, and hast ever given one unmerited pang to the true
heart that now lies cold beneath thy feet, there be sure
that every unkind look, every ungracious word, every un.
gentle action, will come thronging back upon thy mem-
ory, and knock dolefully at thy soul; be sure that thou
wilt lie down sorrowing and repenting on the grave, and
utter the unheard groan, and pour the unavailing tear, -
bitter, because unheard and unavailing.

THE GALLICAN CHURCH, AT THE PERIOD OF THE REVOLU-
Croly.
TION.
(An example of elevated and impressive narrative, combining depth and
force of expressive tone.)
It is among the most memorable facts of intellectual
decline, that of the forty thousand clergy of France, not
one man of conspicuous ability was roused by the immi.
nent danger of his church. Like a flock of sheep, they
relied on their numbers; and the infidel drove them be-
fore him, like a flock of sheep. While the battlements
of their gigantic church were rocking in every blast, there
was no sign of manly precaution, none of generous self-
exposure for the common cause, and scarcely any even
of that wise suspicion which is the strength of the weak.

They took it for granted that the church would last their
time, and were comforted. The pride of the day was
distinction in literature; but the whole ecclesiastical body
of France saw the race run, without an effort for the
prize. They sat wrapped in their old recollections, on
the benches of the amphitheatre, and looked on, without
alarm, while a new generation of mankind were trying
their athletic limbs, and stimulating their young ambition,
in the arena where they had once been unrivalled. Ray-
nal, and the few clerics who distinguished themselves by
authorship, were avowed deists or atheists; and ostenta-
tious of their complete, if not contemptuous separation
from the establishment.
The last light of ecclesiastical literature had glimmered
from the cells of Port Royal; but, with the fall of the
Jansenists, "middle and utter darkness" came. During
half a century, no work of public utility, none of popular
estimation, none of genius, none which evinced loftiness
of spirit, vigor of understanding, or depth of knowledge,
had been produced by a churchman.
The consequence was inevitable and fatal. The old
awe of the church's power was changed into contempt
for its understanding. Ten thousand rents were made in
the fabric: still they let in no light upon the voluntary
slumberers within. The revolutionary roar echoed through
all its chambers; but it stirred no champion of the altar.
The high ecclesiastics relied upon their connection with
the court, their rank, and the formal homage of their offi.
cials; - shields of gossamer against the pike and fire-
brand of the people. The inferior priesthood, consigned
to obscurity, shrank into their villages into cumberers of
the earth, or were irritated into rebels. The feeble con-
tracted themselves within the drowsy round of their pre-
scribed duties; the daring brooded over the national dis-
contents and their own, until they heard the trumpet
sounding to every angry heart and form of ill in France;
and came forth, a gloomy and desperate tribe, trampling

devout emotion.]
Night is the time for rest ;-
How sweet, when labors close,
To gather round an aching breast
The curtain of repose,
Stretch the tired limbs, and lay the head
Upon our own accustomed bed.
Night is the time for dreams;
The gay romance of life,
When truth that is, and truth that seems,
Blend in fantastic strife:-
Ah! visions less beguiling far
Than waking dreams by daylight are !
Night is the time for toil;
To plough the classic field,
Intent to find the buried spoil
Its wealthy furrows yield;
Till all is ours that sages taught,
That poets sang, or heroes wrought.
Night is the time to weep;
To wet with unseen tears
Those
graves
of
memory, where sleep
The joys of other years,
Hopes that were angels in their birth,
But perished young — like things of earth.
Night is the time to watch;
On ocean's dark expanse,
To hail the Pleiades, or catch
The full moon's earliest glance,
That brings unto the home-sick mind
All we have loved - and left behind.

Night is the time for care;
Brooding on hours mis-spent,
To see the spectre of despair
Come to our lonely tent;
Like Brutus 'mid his slumbering host,
Startled by Cæsar's stalwart ghost.
Night is the time to muse;
Then from the eye the soul
Takes flight, and with expanding views,
Beyond the starry pole
Descries, athwart the abyss of night,
The dawn of uncreated light.
Night is the time to pray;
Our Saviour oft withdrew
To desert mountains far away:
So will his followers do,
Steal from the throng to haunts untrod,
And hold communion there with God.
Night is the time for death;
When all around is
peace,
Calmly to yield the weary breath,
From sin and suffering cease,
Think of heaven's bliss and give the sign
To parting friends - such death be mine!
TAE LAND OF BEULAH. - G. B. Cheever.
[The prevalent “ Expression” of the following passage, is that of admi-
ration rising to rapture ; – the tone of joy, however, softened by that
of sacred and solemn feeling.]
No other language than that of Bunyan himself, pe-
rused in the pages of his own sweet book, could be suc-
cessful in portraying the beauty and glory of such a
scene; for now he seems to feel that all the dangers of
the pilgrimage are almost over; and he gives himself up
without restraint so entirely to the sea of bliss that sur-
rounds him, and to the gales of heaven that are wafting

him on, and to the sounds of melody that float in the
whole air around him, that nothing in the English lan-
guage can be compared with this whole closing part of
the "Pilgrim's Progress," for its entrancing splendor, yet
serene and simple loveliness. The coloring is that of
heaven in the soul; and Bunyan has poured his own
heaven-entranced soul into it. With all its depth and
power, there is nothing exaggerated; and it is made up
of the simplest and most scriptural materials and images.
We seem to stand in a flood of light poured on us from
the open gates of Paradise. It falls on every leaf and
shrub by the way-side; it is reflected from the crystal
streams, that between grassy banks wind amidst groves
of fruit-trees into vineyards and flower-gardens. These
fields of Beulah are just below the gate of heaven; and
with the light of heaven there come floating down the
melodies of heaven: so that here there is almost an open
revelation of the things which God hath prepared for
them that love him.
During the last days of that eminent man of God, Dr.
Payson, he once said, “ When I formerly read Bunyan's
description of the land of Beulah, where the sun shines
and the birds sing day and night, I used to doubt whether
there was such a place; but now my own experience has
convinced me of it, and it infinitely transcends all my
previous conceptions.” The best possible commentary
on the glowing description in Bunyan is to be found in
that very remarkable letter dictated by Dr. Payson to his
sister, a few weeks before his death. Were I to adopt
the figurative language of Bunyan, I might date this let-
ter from the land of Beulah, of which I have been for
weeks a happy inhabitant. The Celestial City is full in
my view. Its glories beam upon me; its breezes fan
me; its odors are wafted to me; its sounds strike upon
my ears; and its spirit is breathed into my heart. Noth-
ing separates me from it but the River of Death, which
now appears but as an insignificant rill, that may he

crossed at a single step, whenever God shall give per-
mission. The Sun of Righteousness has been drawing
nearer and nearer, appearing larger and brighter as he
approached; and now he fills the whole hemisphere;
pouring forth a flood of glory, in which I seem to float
like an insect in the beams of the sun; exulting, yet al-
most trembling, while I gaze on this excessive brightness,
and wondering, with unutterable wonder, why God should
deign thus to shine upon a sinful worm.”
There is perhaps, in all our language, no record of a
Christian's happiness before death so striking as this.
What is it not worth, to enjoy such consolations as these,
in our pilgrimage, and especially to experience such fore-
tastes of heaven, as we draw near to the River of Death,
such revelations of God in Christ as can swallow
up
the
fears and pains of dying, and make the soul exult in the
vision of a Saviour's loveliness, the assurance of a Sa-
viour's mercy? There is no self-denial, no toil, no suffer-
ing in this life which is worthy to be compared, for a
moment, with such blessedness.
It is very remarkable that Bunyan has, as it were, at-
tempted to lift the veil from the grave, from eternity, in
the beatific closing part of the Pilgrim's Progress, and to
depict what passes, or may be supposed to pass, with
the souls of the righteous immediately after death. There
is a very familiar verse of Watts, founded on the unsuc
cessful effort of the mind to conceive definitely the man
ner of that existence into which the immortal spirit is to
be ushered.

“ In vain the fancy strives to paint
The moment after death;
The glories that surround the saint
In yielding up his breath.”
The old poet, Henry Vaughan, in his fragment on “ Heav-
en in Prospect,” refers to the same uncertainty, in stanzas
that, though somewhat quaint, are very striking

by the tones of animation, cheerfulness, composure, joy, and courage ; it

When I set sail on Life's young voyage,
’T was upon a stormy sea;
But to cheer me night and day,
Through the perils of the way,
With me went companions three;
Three companions, kind and faithful,
Dearer far than friend or bride,
Heedless of the stormy weather,
Hand in hand they came together,
Ever smiling at my side.
One was Health, my lusty comrade,
Cherry-cheeked and stout of limb;
Though my board was scant of cheer,
And my drink but water clear,
I was thankful, blessed with him.
One was mild-eyed Peace of Spirit,
Who, though storms the welkin swept,
Waking, gave me calm reliance,
And though tempests howled defiance,
Smoothed iny pillow while I slept.

One was Hope, my dearest comrade,
Never absent from my breast,
Brightest in the darkest days,
Kindest in the roughest ways,
Dearer far than all the rest.
And though Wealth, nor Fame, nor Station,
Journeyed with me o'er the sea ;
Stout of heart, all danger scorning,
Nought cared I, in life's young morning,
For their lordly company.
But, alas !ere night bas darkened,
I have lost companions twain;
And the third with tearful eyes,
Worn and wasted, often flies,
But as oft returns again.
And, instead of those departed,
Spectres twin around me flit;
Pointing each with shadowy finger,
Nightly at my couch they linger;
Daily at my board they sit.
Oh! alas ! that I have followed
In the hot pursuit of Wealth;
Though I've gained the prize of gold, –
Eyes are dim, and blood is cold,-
I have lost my comrade, Health.
Care, instead, the withered beldam,
Steals the enjoyment from my cup,
Hugs me, that I cannot quit her;
Makes my choicest morsels bitter;
Seals the founts of pleasure up.
Ah! alas ! that Fame allured me,-
She so false, and I so blind, -
Sweet her smiles; but in the chase
I have lost the happy face
Of my comrade, PEACE OF MIND;
And instead, Remorse, pale phantom,
Tracks my feet, where'er I go;
All the day I see her scowling,

Wildly flitting to and fro.
Last of all my dear companions,
Hope! sweet Hope! befriend me yet!
Do not from my side depart,
Do not leave my lonely heart
All to darkness and regret!
Short and sad is now my voyage
O’er this gloom-encompassed sea,
But not cheerless altogether, -
Whatsoe'er the wind and weather, -
Will it seem, if blessed with thee.
Dim thine eyes are, turning earthwards,
Shadowy pale, and thin thy form.-
Turned to heaven thine eyes grow bright,
All thy form expands in light,
Soft and beautiful and warm.
Look then upwards ! lead me heavenwards!
Guide me o'er this darkening sea !
Pale Remorse sball fade before me,
And the gloom shall brighten o'er me,
If I have a friend in Thee.
HENRY MARTYN. — Macaulay.
(An exercise in the reading of biographical narrative, embodying all the
highest qualities of sentiment and language, and a corresponding in-
tensity of “ Expression” and vividness of “ Variation."]*
Towards the middle of the last century, John Martyn
of Truro was working with his hands in the mines near
that town. He was a wise man, who, knowing the right
use of leisure hours, employed them so as to qualify him-
self for higher and more lucrative pursuits; and who,
knowing the right use of money, devoted his enlarged
means to procure for his four children a liberal education.
Henry, the younger of his sons, was accordingly entered

at the university at Cambridge, where, in January, 1801,
he obtained the degree of bachelor of arts, with the hon-
orary
rank of senior wrangler. There also he became the
disciple, and as he himself would have said, the convert
of Charles Simeon. Under the counsels of that eminent
teacher, the guidance of Mr. Wilberforce, and the active
aid of Mr. Grant, he entered the East India Company's
service, as a chaplain. After a residence in Hindostan of
about five years, he returned homewards through Persia,
in broken health. Pausing at Shiraz, he labored there,
during twelve months, with the ardor of a man, who, dis-
tinctly perceiving the near approach of death, feared lest
it should intercept the great work for which alone he de-
sired to live. That work, (the translation of the New
Testament into Persian,) at length accomplished, he re-
sumed his way towards Constantinople, followed his
Mimander, (one Hassan Aga,) at a gallop, nearly the
whole distance from Tabriz to Tocat, under the rays of a
burning sun, and the pressure of continual fever.
On the 6th of October, 1812, in the thirty-second year
of his age, he brought the journal of his life to a prema-
ture close, by inscribing in it the following words, while
he sought a momentary repose under the shadow of some
trees at the foot of the Caramanian mountains : I sat in
the orchard, and thought, with sweet comfort and fear, of
God, -in solitude, my company, my friend, and comforter.
Oh! when shall time give place to eternity! When shall
appear that new heaven and new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness and love! There shall in nowise enter
anything that defileth; none of that wickedness which
has made men worse than wild beasts; none of those
corruptions which add still more to the miseries of mor-
tality, shall be seen or heard of any more.”
Ten days
afterwards, these aspirations were fulfilled. His body
was laid in the grave by the hands of strangers at Tocat;
and to his disembodied spirit was revealed that awful

vision, which it is given to the pure in heart, and to them
alone, to contemplate.
Among the most momentous events of Martin's life,
was his connection with Charles Simeon, and with such
of his disciples as sought learning at Cambridge, and
learned leisure at Clapham. A mind so beset hy sym-
pathies of every other kind, could not but be peculiarly
susceptible to the contagion of opinion. From that circle
he adopted, in all its unadorned simplicity, the system
called Evangelical, – that system of which, (if Augustin,
Luther, Calvin, Knox, and the writers of the English
Homilies, may be credited) Christ himself was the au-
thor, and Paul, the first and greatest interpreter.
Through shallow heads and voluble tongues, such a
creed, (or indeed any creed,) filtrates so easily, that, of
the multitude who maintain it, comparatively few are
aware of the conflict of their faith with the natural and
unaided reason of mankind. Indeed, he who makes
such an avowal, will hardly escape the charge of affecta-
tion or of inpiety. Yet, if any truth be clearly revealed,
it is, that the apostolic doctrine was foolishness to the
sages of this world. If any unrevealed truth be indispu-
table, it is, that such sages are at this day making, as
they have ever made, ill-disguised efforts to escape the
inferences with which their own admissions teem. Di-
vine philosophy, divorced from human science, - celestial
things stripped of the mitigating veils woven by man's
wit and fancy to relieve them, - form an abyss as im-
passable at Oxford, now, as at Athens, eighteen centuries
ago. To Henry Martyn the gulf was visible, the self-re-
nunciation painful, the victory complete. His understand-
ing embraced, and his heart reposed in, the two compre-
hensive and ever-germinating tenets of the school in
which he studied. Regarding his own heart as corrupt, ,
and his own reason as delusive, he exercised an unlimited
affiance in the holiness and the wisdom of Him, in whose
person the divine nature had been allied to the human,

that, in the persons of his followers, the human might be
allied to the divine.
Such was his religious theory, - a theory which doc.
tors may combat, or admit, or qualify, but in which the
readers of Henry Martyn's biography, letters, and jour-
nals, cannot but acknowledge that he found the resting-
place of all the impetuous appetencies of his mind, the
spring of all his strange powers of activity and endurance.
Prostrating his soul before the real, though the hidden
Presence he adored, his doubts were silenced, his anxie-
ties soothed, and every meaner passion hushed into re-
pose. He pursued divine truth, (as all who would suc-
ceed in that pursuit must pursue it,) by the will rather
than the understanding; by sincerely and earnestly search-
ing out the light which had come into the world, by still
going after it, when perceived, - by following its slight-
est intimations with faith, with resignation, and with con-
stancy, though the path it disclosed led him from the
friends and the home of his youth, across wide oceans
and burning deserts, amidst contumely and contention,
with a wasted frame and an overburthened spirit. He
rose to the sublime in character, neither by the powers of
his intellect, nor by the compass of his learning, nor by
the subtlety, the range, or the beauty of his conceptions,
(for in all these he was surpassed by many,) but by the
copiousness and the force of the living fountains by which
his spiritual life was nourished. Estranged from a world
once too fondly loved, his well-tutored heart learned to
look back with a calm though affectionate melancholy on
its most bitter privations. Insatiable in the thirst for free-
dom, holiness, and peace, he maintained an ardor of de-
votion which might pass for an erotic delirium, when
contrasted with the Sadducean frigidity of other worship-
pers. Regarding all the members of the great human
family as his kindred in sorrow and in exile, his zeal for
their welfare partook more of the fervor of domestic affec-
tion, than of the kind but gentle warmth of a diffusive

sciousness of an intimate union with the Eternal Source
of all virtue, the meek missionary of the cross exhibited
no obscure resemblance to the unobtrusive dignity, the
unfaltering purpose, and the indestructible composure of
Him by whom the cross was borne. The ill-disciplined
desires of youth, now confined within one deep channel,
flowed quickly onwards to one great consummation; nor
was there any faculty of his soul, or any treasure of his
accumulated knowledge, for which appropriate exercise
was not found on the high enterprise to which he was
devoted.

And breathe an humble prayer,
That they may die like him whose bones are mouldering there.

RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE THE VITAL ELEMENT OF POETRY.-
Carlyle.
(An example of “Expression ” affected by noble sentiment and elevated
diction.]*
Burns was born poor, and born also to continue poor;
for he would not endeavor to be otherwise : this it had
been well could he have once for all admitted, and con-
sidered as finally settled. He was poor, truly; but hun-
dreds, even of his own class and order of mind, have been
poorer, yet have suffered nothing deadly from it: nay, his
own father had a far sorer battle with ungrateful destiny
than his was; and he did not yield to it, but died cour.
ageously warring, and, to all moral intents, prevailing,
against it.
True, Burns had little means, had even little time for
poetry, his only real pursuit and vocation; but so much
the more precious was what little he had. In all these

external respects his case was hard; but very far from
the hardest. Poverty, incessant drudgery, and much
worse evils, it has often been the lot of poets and wise
inen to strive with, and their glory to conquer. Locke
was banished as a traitor; and wrote his Essay on the
Luman Understanding, sheltering himself in a Dutch
Farret. Was Milton rich or at his ease, when he com-
Josed Paradise Lost? Not only low, but fallen; not only
poor, but impoverished; “in darkness and with dangers
compassed round," he sang his immortal song, and found
* fit audience, though few.” Did not Cervantes finish his
work, a maimed soldier, and in prison? Nay, was not
the Araucana, which Spain acknowledges as its Epic,
written without even the aid of
paper; on scraps
of leath-
er, as the stout fighter and voyager snatched any moment
from that wild warfare ?
And what then had these men, which Burns wanted?
Two things; both which, it seems to us, are indispensa-
ble for such men. They had a true, religious principle
of morals; and a single not a double aim in their activity.
They were not self-seekers and self-worshippers; but
seekers and worshippers of something far better than
self. Not personal enjoyment was their object; but a
high, heroic idea of religion, of patriotism, of heavenly
wisdom, in one or the other form, ever hovered before
them; in which cause, they neither shrunk from suffer-
ing, nor called on the earth to witness it as something
wonderful; but patiently endured, counting it blessedness
enough so to spend and be spent. Thus the "golden-
calf of self-love," however curiously carved, was not their
Deity ; but the invisible goodness, which alone is man's
reasonable service. This feeling was as a celestial foun-
tain, whose streams refreshed into gladness and beauty
all the provinces of their otherwise too desolate existence.
In a word, they willed one thing, to which all other things
were subordinated, and made subservient; and therefore
they accomplished it. The wedge will rend rocks; but

its edge must be sharp and single: if it he double, the
wedge is bruised in pieces, and will rend nothing.
Part of this superiority these men owed to their age;
in which heroism and devotedness were still practised, or,
at least, not yet disbelieved in: but much of it likewise
they owed to themselves. With Burns, again, it was
different. His morality, in most of its practical points, is
that of a mere worldly man; enjoyment, in a finer or
coarser shape, is the only thing he loves and strives for.
A noble instinct sometimes raises him above this; but an
instinct only, and acting only for moments. He has no
religion: in the shallow age where his days were cast,
religion was not discriminated from the “ New” and “Old
Light" forms of religion; and was, with these, becoming
obsolete in the minds of men. His heart, indeed, is alive
with a trembling adoration; but there is no temple in his
understanding He lives in darkness and in the shadow
of doubt. His religion, at best, is an anxious wish; like
that of Rabelais, " a great Perhaps."
He loved poetry warmly, and in his heart; could he
but have loved it purely and with his whole undivided
heart, it had been well. For poetry, as Burns could have
followed it, is but another form of wisdom, of religion;
is itself wisdom and religion. But this, also, was denied
him. His poetry is a stray, vagrant gleam, which will
not be extinguished within him, yet rises not to be the
true light of his path, but is often a wildfire that misleads
him. It was not necessary for Burns to be rich, to be, or
to seem, independent; but it was necessary for him to be
at one with his own heart; to place what was highest in
his nature, highest also in his life; “to seek within him-
self for that consistency and sequence, which external
events would forever refuse him.” He was born a poet;
poetry was the celestial element of his being, and should
have been the soul of all his endeavors. Lifted into that
serene ether, whither he had wings given him to mount,
he would have needed no other elevation.

a
Poverty, neglect, and all evil, save the desecration of
himself and his art, were a small matter to him: the pride
and the passions of the world lay far beneath his feet;
and he looked down alike on noble and slave, on prince
and beggar, and all that wore the stamp of man, with
clear recognition, with brotherly affection, with sympathy,
with pity. Nay, we question whether for his culture as a
poet, poverty and much suffering, for a season, were not
absolutely advantageous. Great men, in looking back over
their lives, have testified to that effect. I would not for
much,” says Jean Paul, “ that I had been born richer.”
And yet Paul's birth was poor enough; for, in another
place, he adds: “the prisoner's allowance is bread and
water; and I had often only the latter.” But the gold
that is refined in the hottest furnace, comes out the pur-
est; or, as he himself has expressed it, “ the canary-bird
sings sweeter the longer it has been trained in a darkened
cage."
A man like Burns might have divided his hours be-
tween poetry and virtuous industry; industry which all
true feeling sanctions, nay, prescribes, and which has a
beauty, for that cause, beyond the pomp of thrones : but
to divide his hours between poetry and rich men's ban-
quets, was an ill-starred and inauspicious attempt. How
could he be at ease at such banquets ? What had he to
do there, mingling his music with the coarse roar of alto-
gether earthly voices, and brightening the thick smoke of
intoxication with fire lent him from heaven? Was it his
aim to enjoy life? To-morrow he must go drudge as an
Exciseman! We wonder not that Burns became moody,
indignant, and at times an offender against certain rules
of society; but rather that he did not grow utterly frantic,
and “run a muck" against them all. How could a man,
so falsely placed, by his own or others' fault, ever know
contentment, or peaceable diligence, for an hour? What
he did, under such perverse guidance, and what he for-

bore to do, alike fill us with astonishment at the natural
strength and worth of his character.
Doubtless there was a remedy for his perverseness:
but not in others; only in himself; least of all in simple
increase of wealth and worldly respectability.

An evening-cloud, in brief suspense,
Was hither driven and thither;
It came I know not whence,
And went I knew not whither:
I watched it changing in the wind,
Size, semblance, shape and hue,
Fading and lessening, - till behind
It left no speck in heaven's deep blue.
Amidst the marshalled host of night,
Shone a new star supremely bright:
With marvelling eye, well-pleased to err,
I hailed the prodigy ; — anon,
It fell;— it fell like Lucifer,
A flash, a blaze, a train — 't was gone!
And then I sought in vain its place,
Throughout the infinite of space.
Dew-drops, at day-spring, decked a line
Of
gossamer so frail, so fine,
A fly's wing shook it: round and clear,
As if by fairy-fingers strung,
Like orient pearls, at Beauty's ear,
In trembling brilliancy they hung
Upon a rosy brier, whose bloom
Shed nectar round them and perfume :
Ere long, exhaled in limpid air,
Some mingled with the breath of mora,

Some slid down singly, here and there,
Like tears, by their own weight overborne;
At length the film itself collapsed; and where
The pageant glittered, lo! a naked thorn.
What are the living ? Hark! a sound
From the grave and cradle crying,
By earth and ocean echoed round, -
“The living are the dying!”.
-
From infancy to utmost age,
What is man's line of pilgrimage ?
The pathway to Death's portal:
The moment we begin to be,
We enter on the agony;
The dead are the immortal;
They live not on expiring breath,
They only are exempt from death.
Cloud-atoms, sparkles of a falling star,
Dew-drops, or films of gossamer we are:
What can the state beyond us be ?
Life ?- Death ? — Ah! no, - a greater mystery !-
What thought hath not conceived, ear heard, eye seen;
Perfect existence from a point begun;
Part of what God's eternity bath been:
Whole immortality belongs to none
But Him, the first, the last, the Only One!

'Tis cloudless morning; but a frown misplaced,
Cold, lurid, strange,

What fearful change,
What menacing catastrophe is thus
Ushered by such prognostics ominous ?
Is it the life of day, this livid glare,

What means the withering coldness in the air,
That chills my heart,
And what the gloom portentous that hath made
The glow of morning a funereal shade ?
O’er the Sun's disk, a dark orb wins its slow,
Gloom-deepening way,
Climbs, - spreads, - enshrouds, - extinguishes, -and lo!
The god of day
Hangs in the sky, a corpse! The usurper's might
Hath stormed his throne, and quenched the life of light!
-
A pall is on the earth ; – the screaming birds
To covert speed,
Bewildered and aghast; the bellowing herds
Rush o'er the mead;
While men, – pale shadows in the ghastly gloom, -
Seem spectral forms just risen from the tomb.
Transient, though total, was that drear eclipse :
With might restored,
The Sun regladdened earth;— but human lips
Have never poured
In mortal ears the horrors of the sight
That thrilled my soul that memorable night.
To every distant zone and fulgent star
Mine eyes could reach,
And the wide waste was one chaotic war:
O'er all and each, -
Above -- beneath — around me — everywhere -
Was anarchy,- convulsion, — death, - despair.

'Twas noon;
and yet a deep unnatural night
Enshrouded heaven,
Save where some orb unsphered, or satellite
Franticly driven,
Glared as it darted through the darkness dread,
Blind, -rudderless, - unchecked, -unpiloted.
A thousand simultaneous thunders crashed,

Some rushing planet 'gainst another dashed,
Shooting through air
Volleys of shattered wreck, when both, destroyed,
Foundered and sank in the engulfing void.
Others self-kindled, as they whirled and turned,
Without a guide,
Burst into flames, and rushing as they burned
With range more wide,
Like fire-ships that some stately fleet surprise,
Spread havoc through the constellated skies.
While stars kept falling from their spheres, -as though
The heavens wept fire, –
Earth was a raging hell of war and woe,
Most deep and dire;
Virtue was vice, - vice, virtue - all was strife;
Brute force was law, – justice, the assassin's knife.

From that fell scene my space-commanding eye
Glad to withdraw,
I pierced the empyrean palace of the sky,
And shuddering saw
A vacant throne, a sun's extinguished sphere, -
All else a void, — dark, desolate, and drear.
“What mean,” I cried, “ these sights unparalleled,
These scenes of fear ?"
When lo! a voice replied; and nature held
Her breath to hear -
“ Mortal! the scroll before thine eyes unfurled
Displays a soul-eclipse, an atheist world !”
I woke — my dream was o'er! What ecstasy
It was to know
That God was guide and guardian of the sky,
That man below,
Deserved the love I felt, - I could not speak
The thrilling joy whose tears were on my cheek !

Which lights this nether globe, — yet to our eye
Small as the glow-worm's lamp!- To you

My vision strays o'er your ethereal hosts ;
Too vast, too boundless for our narrow mind,
Warped with low prejudice, to unfold,
And sagely comprehend, - thence higher soaring,
Through ye I raise my solemn thoughts to Him,
The mighty Founder of this wondrous maze,
The great Creator! Him! who now sublime,
Wrapt in the solitary amplitude
Of boundless space, above the rolling sphere
Sits on his silent throne, and meditates.
The angelic hosts, in their inferior heaven,
Hymn to the golden harps his praise sublime,
Repeating loud, “ The Lord our God is great!”
In varied harmonies. — The glorious sounds
Roll o'er the air serene. The Æolian spheres,
Harping along their viewless boundaries,
Catch the full note, and cry, “ The Lord is great!”.
Responding to the seraphim. - O’er all,
From orb to orb, to the remotest verge
Of the created world, the sound is borne,
Till the whole universe is full of H
Oh! 't is this heavenly harmony which now
In fancy strikes upon my listening ear,
And thrills my inmost soul. It bids me smile
On the vain world, and all its bustling cares,
And gives a shadowry glimpse of future bliss.

(This piece is intended to exemplify the “ Expression” and “ Varia-

Let me move slowly through the street,
Filled with its ever-shifting train,
Amid the sound of steps that beat
The murmuring walk, like autumn rain.
How fast the flitting figures come!
The mild, the fierce, the stony face;
Some bright with thoughtless smiles, and some
Where secret tears have left their trace.
-
They pass — to toil, to strife, to rest,
To halls in which the feast is spread,
To chambers where the funeral guest
In silence sits beside the dead.
And some to happy homes repair,
Where children, pressing cheek to cheek,
With mute caresses shall declare
The tenderness they cannot speak.
And some, who walk in calmness here,
Shall shudder as ey reach the door
Where one who made their dwelling dear,
Its flower, its light, is seen no more.
Youth, with pale cheek and slender frame,
And dreams of greatness in thine eye!
Go'st thou to build an early name, -
Or early in the task to die?
Keen son of trade, with eager
brow!
Who is now fluttering in thy snare ?
Thy golden fortunes, tower they now,
Or melt the glittering spires in air ?
Who of this crowd to-night shall tread
The dance till daylight gleam again?
Who sorrow o'er the untimely dead ?
Who writhe in throes of pain ?

Some, famine-struck, shall think how long
The cold dark hours, how slow the light!
And some, who flaunt amid the throng,
Shall hide in dens of shame to night

There is who heeds, who holds them all,
In His large love and boundless thought.
These struggling tides of life that seem
In wayward, aimless course, to tend,

(Passages such as the following exemplify the varied “Expression”
resulting from the successive effects of narration, description, and di-

The services preliminary to the sermon, had been
nearly gone through, and the last verse of a hymn was
being sung, when Mr. Hall ascended slowly, and, I
thought, wearily, the pulpit stairs. No one, looking at
his somewhat unwieldy and rather ungraceful figure,
would have been prepossessed in his favor; and, as he
sat down in the pulpit, and looked languidly round on the
congregation, I experienced, I Ķnow not why, a feeling of
disappointment.
He rose, and read his text: “ The Father of Lights.”
At first, his voice was scarcely audible, and there ap-
peared some slight hesitation; but this soon wore off;
and as he warmed with his subject, he poured forth such
a continuous stream of eloquence, that it seemed as if it
flowed from some inexhaustible source. His tones were.

breathless silence reigned throughout the vast assem-
blage; but his momentary cessation was the signal for
general relaxation from an attention so intense that it be-
came almost painful. It was curious to observe how
every neck was stretched out, so that not a vord which
fell from those eloquent lips should be lost; and the sus-
pended breathings of those around me, evinced how in-
tently all were hanging on his charmed words.
Mr. Hall's fluency was wonderful, and his command of
language unsurpassed. I will not mar the beauty of his
discourse, by attempting to describe it; but, as I followed
him, whilst, by his vivid imagination, he conveyed his
hearers through the starry skies, and reasoned, from those
lights of the universe, what the Father of Lights must be,
I became lost in wonder and admiration.
But the crowning glory of his sermon was his allusion
to the heavenly world, whose beatific glories he expati-
ated on, with almost the eloquence of an angel. He
seemed like one inspired; and, as he guided us by living
streams, and led us over the celestial fields, he seemed
carried away by his subject, and his face beamed as if it
reflected Heaven's own light. And this was the man
who, but an hour before, had lain down on the ground, in
the excess of his agony; and who, from his earliest years,
had constantly endured the most excruciating torture which
man can be called upon to bear! I have myself heard
him say that he had never known one waking hour free
from extreme pain.
Mr. Hall used very little action in the pulpit. His fa-
vorite -or, rather his usual — attitude, was, to stand, and
lean his chest against the cushion; his left arm lying on
the Bible, and his right hand slightly raised, with the
palm towards the audience. His tones were almost uni-
formly low; and he rarely raised them. Ideas seemed
so to accumulate, whilst he was preaching, that they
flowed forth without effort on his part. Never did he
hesitate; - and, so pure were his oral compositions, that

Raised from the common earth by common toil,
Enjoy the equal produce. Such delights
As float to earth, permitted visitants !
When in some hour of solemn jubilee
The massy gates of Paradise are thrown
Wide open, and forth come in fragments wild
Sweet echoes of unearthly melodies,
And odors snatched from beds of amaranth,
And they, that from the crystal river of life
Spring up on freshened wing, ambrosial gales !
The favored good man in his lonely walk
Perceives them, and his silent spirit drinks
Strange bliss which he shall recognize in heaven.
And such delights, such strange beatitudes
Seize on my young anticipating heart
When that blest future rushes on my view!
For in his own and in his Father's might
The Saviour comes! While as the Thousand Years
Lead
up their mystic dance, the Desert shouts !
Old Ocean claps his bands !
O years ! the blest preëminence of saints !
Ye

athwart my gaze, so heavenly bright,
The wings that veil the adoring seraph's eye,
What time they bend bofore the jasper Throne,
Reflect no lovelier hues !
Believe thou, O my soul,
Life is a vision shadowy of Truth;
And vice, and anguish, and the wormy grave,
Shapes of a dream! The veiling clouds retire;
And lo! the throne of the redeeming God,
Forth flashing unimaginable day,
Wraps in one blaze, earth, heaven, and deepest hell.

GREEK GRAMMAR; with Modifications and Notes by S. H. TAYLOR,
LL.D., I'rincipal of Phillips Academy. 12mo. pp. 57. Paper covers, 40 cts.
These questions are designed to aid the pupil in making his knowledge of the principles of

MURPHY OJ GENESIS A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the
Book of Genesis; with a new Trarslation. By JAMES G. MURPHY, LL.D.,
T.C.D. Professor of Hebrew, Belfast. With a Preface by J. P. THOMPSON,
D.D., New York. 8vo. Pp. 135. S3.50.
“ Dr. Thompson, in the preface, commends this work, 'as a timely antidote to much of the
negative and destructive criticisin up in the Pentateuch.' Dr. Murphy is an Irish Presbyterian,
who has prepared several books which show high scholarship and patient rescarclı; and this
book proves him to be a devont and believing Christian. His handling of Colenso's difficulties
shows his Iris!, wit as well as his learning and logic. The translation here given is very beau-
tiful, and in such explicit language as to be a rich commentary of itself, while the abundant
and rich information given in the notes charms the reader on with more than the zest of fiction.
The volume reads more like a book of critical history, and must have a decided popularity in
this country." — Boston Recorder.
· The most valuable contribution that has for a long time been inade to the many aids for the
critical study of the Old Testament, is Mr. Draper's republication of Dr. Murphy on Genesis,
in one octavo volume. Dr. Murphy is one of the Professors of the Assembly's College at Belfast.
and adds to a thorough knowledge of the Hebrew, and of the science of interpretation, great
common sense, genuine wit, and admirable power of expression. Ince his cominentary is
racy and readable, as well as reliable. No volume will be more useful to those who have been
troubled by the Colenso criticisms; and no man has pricked the bubble of that inflated bislop
with a more effectual and relieving wound than Dr. Murphy. It is a good deal to siy of a com-
mentary, but we say it in all sincerity, that this volume furnishes about as fascinating work for
one's hours for reading, as any volume of the day, in any department of literature; while its
general influence will be salutary, and effective for the truth."- Congregationalist.
POND'S PASTORAL THEOLOGY. Lectures on Pastoral Theology.

“We are glad to notice a new edition of 'Lectures on Pastoral Theology,' by Rev. Dr Pond,
of the Theological Seminary in Bar gor, Me., first published twenty years ago. These lectures
have been almost entirely rewritten, and several of them have been moditied in important
respects. A valuable feature of the book is its practical character: pastoral duties and relations,
and questions which are likely to perplex the minds of young ministers, especially, being
treated with minuteness and plain ness. Clear common sense - a rare quality - and a correct
view of the mutual relations of pastor and people are characteristics of every lecture; and the
devout spir t pervading the treatment of the many subjects is what we should naturally expect
from the author." - Congregationalist.

“We regard the present volume as, on the whole, the ablest of his theological works. It de-
serves the faithful study of every clergyman. Dr. Whately is one of those authors who can be
as profitably read by those who do not agree with him as by those who do. The religious opin-
ions of a writer who earned so eminent a name in the department of logic and rhetoric, and who
had so great skill in the practical affairs relating to the state as well as the church, cannot be
without peculiar interest to the theologian." - Bib. Sac., Jan. 1866.

The Commentaries of Prof. Ellicott supply an urgent want in their sphere of criticism. Prof.
Stowe says of them, in his Notice: “It is the crowning excellence of these Commentaries that
they are exactly what they profess to be, critical and grammatical, and therefore, in the best
sense of the term, erructical. ..... Ilis results are worthy of all confidencc. Ile is more care-
ful than Tischendorf, slower and more steadily deliberate than Alford, and more patiently
laborious than any other living New Testament critic, with the excep.vn, perhaps, of Treg.:-
les."
" They (Ellicott's Commentaries) have set the first example, in ihis Or?.. planil] of 1
thorough and fearless examinatiou of the grammatical and philological requirements of eve
word of the sacred text. I do not know of anything superior to them, in their own particular
line, in Germany; and they add, what, alas! is so seldom found in that cou. y', profound
reverence for the matter and subjects on which the author is laboring; nor is their value
lessened by Mr. Ellicott's having confined himself for the most part to one department of a
commentator's work - the grammatical and philological." - Dean Alford.
“ The critical part is devoted to the settling of the text, and this is admirably done, with a
labor, skill, and conscientiousness unsurpassed." – Bib. Sacra.
" We have never inet with a learned commentary on any book of the New Testament 80
nearly perfect in every respect as the Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians,' by Prof.
Ellicott, of King's College, London, - learned, devout, and orthodox." - Independent.
* We would recommend all scholars of the original Scriptures who seek directness, luminous
brevity, the absence of everything irrelevant to strict grammatical inquiry, with a concise and
yet very complete view of the opinions of others, to possess themselves of Ellicott's Commen-
taries." - American Presbyterian.

HENDERSON ON THE MINOR PROPHETS. THE BOOK
OF THE TWELVE MINOR PROPHETS. Translated from the Original
Hebrew. With a Commentary, Critical, Philological, and Exegetical. By
E. HENDERSON, D.D. With a Biographical Sketch of the Author, by E. P.
BARROWS, Hitchcock Professor in Andover Theological Seminary. 8vo.
pp. 490. $ 4.00.
“ This Commentary on the Minor Prophets, like that on the Prophecy of Isaiah, has been
highly and deservedly esteemed by professional scholars, and has been of great service to the
working ministry. We are happy to welcome it in an American edition, very neatly printed."
-Bib. Sacra.
“Clergymen and other students of the Bible will be glad to see this handsome American
edition of a work which has a standard reputation in its department, and which fills a place
that is filled, so far as we know, by no other single volume in the English language. Dr. Hen-
derson was a good llebrew and Biblical scholar, and in his Commentaries he is intelligent,
brief, and to the point." — Boston Recorder.
“The American publisher issues this valuable work with the consent and approbation of the
author, obtained from himself before his death. It is published in substantial and elegant style,
clear white paper and beautiful type. The work is invaluable for its philological research and
critical acumen. The notes are learned, reliable, and practical, and the volume deserves a
place in every theological student's library." — American Presbyterian, etc.
"Of all his Commentaries none are more popular than his Book of the Minor Prophets." -
Christian Observer.
“ This is probably the best Commentary extant on the Minor Prophets. The work is worthy
of a place in the library of every scholar and every diligent and earnest reader of the Bible." -
Christian Chronicle.

COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS. By
MOSES STUART, late Professor of Sacred Literature in the Theological
Semuary at Andover. Third Edition. Edited and revised by Prof. R. D.
C. ROBBINS. 12mo. pp. 514. $2.25.
“His Commentary on the Romans is the most elaborate of all his works. It has elicited more
discussion than any of his other exegetical volumes. It is the result of long continued, patient
thought. It expresses, in clear style, his maturest conclusions. It has the animating influence
of an original treatise, written on a novel pian, and under a sense of personal responsibility.
Regarding it in all its relations, its antecedents and consequents, we pronounce it the most
important Commentary which has appeared in this country on this Epistle,"— Bib. Sacra.
. We heartily commend this work to all students of the Bible. The production of one of the
tirst Biblical scholars of our age, on the most important of all the doctrinal br» ks of the au
Testament, it deserves the careful study, not only of those who agree with Prof Stuart in his
theological and exegetical principles, but of those who earnestly dissent from some of his
views in both respects." - Il'utchman and Reflector.
“This contribution by Prof. Stuart has justly taken a high place among the Commentaries
on the Epistle to the liomans, and, with his other works, wiil always be held in high estimation
by the student of the Sacred Scriptures." - New York Observer.
COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS.
By Pror. M STUART. Third Edition. Edited aud revised by I'rof. R. D. C.
ROBBINS. 12mo. pp. 575. $2.25.
" It is a rich treasure for the student of the original. As a commentator, Prof. Stuart was
especially arduous and faithful in following up the thought and displi ying the connection of a
passage, and his work as a scholar will bear comparison with any that have since uppeared on
either side of the Atlantic." - American Presbyterian.
" This Commentary is classical, both as to its literary and its theological merits. The edition
before nis is very skilfully edited, by Professor Robbins, and gives in full Dr. Stuart's text, with
additions bringing it down to the present day.”– Episcopal Recorder.
“We have always regarded this excellent Commentary is tiie happiest effort of the late
Andover Professor. It seems to us well-nigh to exhaust the subjects which the author compre-
hended in his plan." – Boston Recorder.
" It is from the mind and heart of an eminent Biblical scholar, whose labors in the cause of
sacred learning will not soon be forgotten." - Christian Obserrer.
COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF PROVERBS. By PROF.
M. STUART. 12mo. pp. 432. $ 1.75.
“This is the last work from the pen of Prof. Stuart. Both this Commentary and the one
preceding it, on Ecelesiastrs, exhibit a mellowhes of spirit which savors of the good man ripen-
ing for heaven; and the style is more condensed, and, in that respect, more agreeable, than in
some of the works which were written in the unabated freshness and exuberant vigor of his
minil. In learning and critical acumen they are equal to his former works. No English
reader, we venture to say, con elsewhere find so complete a philological exposition of these two
important books of the Old Testament." — Bib. Sacra.

GUERICKE'S CHURCH HISTORY. Translated by W. G. T. SHEDD,
Brown Professor in Audover Theological Seminary. 449 pp. 8vo. $3.00.
This volume includes the period of the ANCIENT CHURCH (the first six centuries, A. C.) or the
Apostolic and Patristic Church.
We regurd Professor Shedd's version, now under notice, as a happy specimen of the TRANS-
FUSION rather than a TRANSLATION, which many of the German treatises should receive.
The style of his version is far superior to that of the original.- (Bib. Sacra, Jan. 1858.
The established credit of Guericke's labors in the department of Ecclesiastical History, and the
use made of his works by many English writers will make this volume acceptable to a very large
class of students and readers. - London Journal of Sacred Literature.
Guericke's History is characterized by research, devoutness, firm grasp of evangelical truth,
and careful exhibition of the practical as well as the intellectual uspects of Christianity. – North
British Review.
DISCOURSES AND ESSAYS. By PROF. W. G. T. SHEDD. 271 pp.
12mo. $1.50.
Few clearer and more penetrating minds can be found in our country than that of Prof.
Chedd. And besides, he writes with a chaste and sturdy eloquence, transparent as crystal ; so
that if he goes DEEP, we love to follow him. If the mind gets dull, or dry, or ungovernable,
put it to grappling with these masterly productions. – [Congregational Herald, Chicago.
The striking sincerity, vigor, and learning of this volume will be admired even by those read-
ers who cannot go with the author in all his opinions. Whatever debate the philosophical ten-
dencies of the book may challenge, its literary ability and moral spirit will be commended every
where. - New Englander.
These discourses are all marked by profound thought and perspicuity of sentiment. —
Princeton Review.
LECTURES UPON THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. By
PROF. W. G. T. SHEDD. 128 pp. 12mo. 75 cents.
Contents. - The abstract Idea of History. - The Nature and Definition of Secular History.
- The Nature and Definition of Church History. - The Verifying Test in Church History.
The style of these Lectures has striking merits. The author chooses his words with rare skill
and taste, from an ample vocabulary, and writes with strength and refreshing simplicity. The
Philosophy of Realism, in application to history and historical thcology, is advocated by vigor.
ous reasoning, and made intelligible by original and felicitous illustrations. — New Englander.
Professor Shedd has already achieved a high reputation for the union of philosophic insight
with genuine scholarship, of depth and clearness of thought with force and elegance of style,
and for profound views of sin and grace, cherished not merely on theoretical, but still more on
moral and experimental grounds. - Princeton Review.
OUTLINES OF A SYSTEMATIC RHETORIC. From the German
of DR. FRANCIS THEREMIN, by WILLIAM G. T. SHEDD. Third and Revised
Edition, with an Introductory Essay by the translator. pp. 216. 12mo. $1.00.
This is a work of much solid value. It is adapted to advanced students, and can be read and
reread with advantage by professed public speakers, however accomplished they may be in the
important art of persuasion. This edition is an improvement upon the other, containing a new
introductory essay, illustrating the leading position of the work, and a series of questions adapt-
ing it to the use of the student. — Boston Recorder.
It is not a work of surface suggestions, but of thorough and philosophic analysis, and, as such,
is of great value to the student, and especially to him who habitually addresses men on the most
important themes. – Congregational Quarterly.
The Introductory Essay which Professor Shedd has prefixed to this valuable Treatise, is elab-
orate, vigorous, impressive. It excites the mind not only to thought, but also to the expression
of thought, to inward and outward activity. The whole volume is characterized by freshness
and originality of remark, a purity and earnestness of moral feeling. - Bib. Sacra, 1859.

THEOLOGIA GERMANICA. Which setteth forth many fair lineaments
of Divine Truth, and saith very lofty and lovely things touching a Perfect Life.
Edited by Dr. PFEIFFER, from the only complete manuscript yet known.
Translated from the German by SUSANNA WINKWORTH. With a Preface by
the Rev. CHARLES KINGSLEY, Rector of Eversley; and a Letter to the Trans-
lator, by the CHEVALIER BUNSEN, D. D., D. C. L., etc.; and an Introduction
by PROF. CALVIN E STOWE, D. D. 275 pp. 16mo. Cloth, $1.50.
This treatise was discovered by Luther, who first brought it into notice by an edition which
he published in 1516, of which he says : " And I will say, though it be boasting of myself, and
I speak as a fool,' that, next to the Bible and St. Augustine, no book hath ever come into my
hands whence I have learnt, or would wish to learn, more of what God and Christ, and man,
and all things, are."
“ The times and the circumstances in which this most rich, thoughtful, and spiritually
quickening little treatise was produced, – the national and ecclesiastical tendencies and influ-
ences which invested its author, and which gave tone, direction, and pressure to his thoughts,
- are amply and well set forth in the preface by Miss Winkworth, and the letter of Bunsen.
The treatise itself is richly deserving of the eulogies upon it so emphatically and affectionately
uttered by Prof. Stowe and Mr. Kingsley, and, long before them, by Luther, who said that it
had profited him more than any other book, save only the Bible and the works of Augustine.'
Sin, as a universal disease and defilement of the nature of man ; Christ, as an indwelling life,
light, and heavenly power ; Holiness, as the utmost good for the soul ; and Heaven, as the
state or place of the consummation of this holiness, with the consequent vision of God, and
the ineffable joy and peace, – these are the theme of the book. And it has the graad, and in
this day the so rare and almost singular merit, of having been prompted by a real and deep relig-
ious experience, and of having been written, not with outward assistance, but with the enthu-
siasm, the spiritual wisdom, and the immense inward freedom and energy, of a soul itself con-
scious of union with Christ, and exulting in the sense of being made, through him, ' a partaker
of the Divine nature.'
“ Those who have known the most of Christ will value most this "golden treatise." Those
whose experience of the divine truth has been deepest and most central will find the most in
it to instruct and to quicken them. To such it will be an invaluable volume worth thousands
upon thousands of modern scientific or hortatory essays upon “Religion made easy."
“It is printed by Mr. Draper, at the Andover press, in the old English style, with beautiful
car fulness and skill, and is sent, post paid, to all who remnit him one dollar."— Independent.
“ The work is at once a literary curiosity and a theological gem." — Puritan Recorder.
“ This little volume, which is brought out in antique type, is, apart from its intrinsic value, a
curiosity of literature. It may be regarded as the harbinger of the Protestant Reformation.".
Evening Traveller,

THE CONFESSIONS OF ST. AUGUSTINE. Edited, with an
Introduction, by Prof. W. G. T. SHEDD. $1.50.
“In this beautiful edition of Augustine's Confessions, published in the antique style, the
translation has been carefully revised by Prof. Shedd, of Andover, from a comp:rison with the
Latin text. His Introduction presents a fine analysis of Augustine's religious experience in its
bearing apon his theological system. Both the intellect and the heart of the modern preacher
may be refreshed and stimulated by the frequent perusal of these confessions.” — Independent.
“ Pruf. Shedd has earned our heartfelt thanks for this elegant edition of Augustine's Confes-
sions. The book is profitable for the Christian to study, and we would commend it as a daily
coinpanion in the closet of the intelligent believer who desires to be taught the way to holiness
through communion of the Spirit. Prof. Shedd's Introduction is a masterly essay, which itself
is a volume for attentive reading. It ought to be read before the book is begun. Thorough,
searching, and discriminating beyond the facts it communicates, its instructions and hints are
suggestive and invaluable." - N. Y. Observer.
“This is a beautiful edition of a precious work. The Confessions of Augustine are so honest,
that we easily become enthusiastic in their praise. The depth of his picty, the boldness of his
imagination, the profoundness of his genius, his extravagant conceptions, liis very straining and
stretching of philosophical and biblical statements, have all a certain charm which ensures for
his works an enduring popularity."- Bib. Sacra, 1860, p. 671.
“We have long wanted to see just such an edition of Augustine's Confessions. The editor
has done a public service in introducing it; and its typographical beauty is no small recom-
mendation of it." - Presbyterian, June 23, 1880.
