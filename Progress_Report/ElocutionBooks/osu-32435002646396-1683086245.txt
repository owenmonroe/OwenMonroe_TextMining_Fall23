PREFACE.
The information given in the following pages is
all that I have found necessary, in order to make
my pupils understand the Principles of Elocution.
Long-winded and professedly learned essays or
lectures are of absolutely nọ practical value. No-
body ever yet learnt Elocution from merely listening
to lectures. All that is essential can be explained
in a few viva voce lessons, and, after that, steady
and intelligent practice, for a time, under a careful
teacher is enough to enable the pupil to carry
on his education. From my own experience, I
have found that the shorter, the simpler, the
clearer the explanation, not only is it more readily
apprehended, but the pupil is much more willing
to place confidence in a man who does not pre-
tend to be the expounder of some mysterious and
abstruse Art.
The Section on the Voice, which has been re-
vised by an able Throat Specialist, is almost a
novelty in a book treating of Elocution. I found
that, entertaining the views I do of the duties

of a Teacher, it was absolutely necessary to learn
the construction of the Vocal Organs, so as to
explain how the voice should be best produced,
and why it should be produced in a certain way.
As to the Voice Remedies, none have been men-
tioned which have not been tried by myself and
found useful and efficient. Of course, the same
particular remedy may not suit everybody or every
occasion, but a very few trials will enable anyone to
fix upon the remedy which suits best under cer-
tain circumstances,
My best thanks are due to Mr. Wilson Barrett
who readily and courteously favoured me with two
effective pieces for the purpose of annotation.

ELOCUTION.
Among Coleridge's accomplishments good reading was not one
he had neither voice nor management of voice. This defect is
unfortunate in a public lecturer, for it is inconceivable how much
weight and effectual pathos can be communicated by sonorous depth
and melodious cadences of the human voice to sentiments the most
trivial ; nor, on the other hand, how the grandest are emasculated by a
style of reading which fails in distributing the lights and shadows of a
musical intonation."-- De Quincey.
“ If I could have a son or daughter possessed of but one accom-
plishment in liſe, it should be that of good reading.”—Ruskin.
“ Recitation is the best and most natural way to introduce an
assurance and confidence in speaking, with that leisure and tone of
pronunciation that is decent and graceful, and in which so few men are
excellent, for want of information and care when they are young.”-
Lord Clarendon.
IT
T is unnecessary to enlarge upon the merit, the
necessity and the advantages of Elocution, i.e.,
of a good style of Reading and Speaking, or
delivering written or spoken composition with a
clear, audible, distinct pronunciation of the words,
and with appropriate and suitable modulations and

inflections of the voice. This, however, though
important and, in fact, nearly all that is required
from the Reader, is not all-sufficient for the Speaker,
who, in addition, must also possess and apply with
discretion the adjuncts of expression of feature, and
of grace and force of gesture.
In the most ancient authors we find sentiments
constantly recurring as to the desirability of a good
delivery. Cicero, in one of his Orations, says :-
“ Delivery is the only thing in speaking which is
supreme. Without it, the greatest orator can achieve
nothing ; with it, persons of commonplace or mediocre
ability can often surpass the greatest. Demosthenes,
when asked what was the first essential in a public
speaker is stated to have replied three times in
succession-Delivery.” I need not, however, go so
far back, but will only quote some expressions by
leading clergymen and others in modern times :-
“The management of the voice and gesture in public
speaking is intimately connected with what is, or
ought to be, the end of all speaking-persuasion.”—
Rev. Hugh Blair, D.D., Professor of Rhetoric in the
University of Edinburgh. “It is certain that proper
gestures and exertion of the voice cannot be too
much studied by a public orator. They are a kind
of comment to what he utters, and enforce every-
thing he says better than the strongest argument he
can make use of. They keep the audience awake,
and fix their attention on what is delivered to them ;
at the same time, they show that the speaker is in

earnest, affected himself by what he so passionately
recommends to others."-Addison. But, perhaps,
the strongest sentiments ever expressed on the im-
portance of Elocution are to be found in a lecture on
Education, delivered at the Royal Institution, by J. R.
Seeley, Professor of Modern History in the University
of Cambridge :-" The first thing is, that boys should
be taught to read well. By reading well, I do not
mean merely correctly ; but distinctly and ex-
pressively. In short, they should be taught Elocution.
To this I attach the greatest importance. It is more
than one hundred years since Bishop Berkeley pro-
pounded the question, whether half the learning and
talent in England were not lost because Elocution
was not taught in schools and colleges ? This same
question might be repeated now; and it is not
merely for its practical use in after life to those whose
profession demands public speaking, that I desire to
see Elocution made a part of Education, but because
I think that, by this means, more than any other, may
be evoked in the minds of the young a taste for
poetry and eloquence. This taste is really very
universal ; generally, where it appears wanting, it is
only dormant; and it is dormant because no means
have ever been taken to cultivate the sense of
rhythm and to make the delightfulness of speech
understood.”
One of the principal and most valuable aims which
those who learn Elocution should hold before them,
is the learning of good poems by heart. Professor

ELOCUTION.
F. W. Newman speaks of the practice of Recitation
as “a valuable mental exercise.” “It will often
happen,” he writes, “ that in the private reading of
a piece of poetry, a young person carries off but a
tame and dry conception; but on hearing it well read
finds in it a depth of feeling and variety of allusion
which had previously escaped his notice. In order to
read even with right inflections, a sound understanding
of the syntax is needed. This is something. But it
is far more to enter into the delicate shades of
sentiment or deeper emotions which lie beneath the
letter, and are not really expressed on the page. No
reading of poetry, or of classically written prose,
conveys the whole sense to the hearer's heart, unless
there is feeling in the utterance; and to be able
readily to express the feeling of any proposed passage
is a high test of delicately cultivated sentiment.
That a person understands and feels what
has been written is in no way so well proved as by
his reciting the words with judgment and feeling.”
There is another point in connection with reciting,
to which I will just refer. The late Sir Henry
Holland, M.D., Physician to the Queen, and one of
the recognised authorities of his day, says “Read-
ing aloud is one of very ancient recommendation
for exercising the function of respiration by those
who have any tendency to pulmonary disorders-
“the good effects of which are not limited to this
object alone. It might, indeed, be well were the
practice of distinct recitation, such as implies a certain

an
effort of the organs beyond that of mere ordinary
speaking, more generally used in early life, and con-
tinued as a habit, or regular exercise, but especially by
those whose chests are weak, and who cannot sustain
stronger exertions.
The common course of
education is much at fault in this respect. If some
small part of the time given to crowding facts on the
mind not yet prepared to receive or retain them, were
employed in fashioning and improving the organs of
speech under good tuition, and with suitable subjects
for recitation, both mind and body would often gain
materially by the substitution.” And in the same
connection, Dr. John Armstrong,
eminent
physician, who lived towards the close of the last
century, says in his “ Art of Preserving Health” :-
And read aloud, resuunding Homer's strains ;
And wield the thunder of Demosthenes ;
The chest so exercised improves its strength.”
What is Elocution ? It literally means distinct
utterance ; but it has now come to signify the art of
delivering written or spoken language in the manner
best calculated to express the sense, beauty, or force
of the words which are used by the speaker, by
means of tones of the voice and by gesture.
The requisites of a good delivery are :-
I. The clear enunciation of the separate words
and their elements.
2. The proper expression of the sense of the
words in connected discourse.
3. Appropriate gesture, in which are included the

a
attitude, the motions of the body, head, or arms, and
the aspect of the countenance most suitable to lend
animation and force to the words uttered.
It is impossible to learn Elocution and Declama-
tion from books, or by merely listening to a lecture.
Elocution can be learnt thoroughly only by oral
teaching, accompanying, or following on, a theoretical
knowledge of the subject. But there are certain
rules, by observing which the pupil will more readily
apprehend and recognise the reason of a certain
mode of reading on the part of the teacher, and by
practising which he will himself become a good
reader and speaker.
Long-winded essays and rambling lectures on the
Art of Speaking, in nearly all cases leave matters
pretty much where they were at first. The reader,
too often in vain, looks in the cloud of words for
the grains of information which he can
can apply
successfully. I will try not to commit these faults.
The rules which I will lay down will be practical,
clear, concise and easily understood. To begin, then,
with the most elementary rules, which, at first sight,
may appear trivial, but which are absolutely essential,
and without which a reader or a speaker will never
be able to do justice either to himself or his subject.
Sit quiet for a short time before speaking; when
you are ready and have got on your legs, stand
in a perfectly erect but easy position. Throw your
chest well out, and hold the shoulders backward
and downward. The object of this is, as much as

7
possible to expand the chest and allow the air
passages of the lungs free and uninterrupted play.
In order to let the voice have full power, the mouth
should be well opened by lowering the under jaw,
but not so as to distort the features. Let the weight
of the body always rest on one foot, the other being
placed in such a position as, when necessary, to
relieve it promptly and without effort. Alternation
of posture is agreeable and graceful; but it should
not be too frequent, as the idea of nervousness and
fidgetiness is thus suggested.
Practise the following positions :-First position-
rest on the left leg, the right foot being slightly
in advance, and at an angle of about 75 degrees.
Second position-slide right foot forward when
emphasizing a sentiment, or stretching out the arms
to the audience ; rest on right foot, the ball of the
leſt great toe alone touching the floor, so as to
keep the body from tottering. Alternate these
positions with left leg, for third and fourth positions,
but not too frequently, and in doing so let the motions
be made with the utmost simplicity. The fourth
position, however, is rarely used except by those who
have been badly taught. The first position of the
right foot is the more usual and more graceful
one, inasmuch as it is better suited to the gestures
which are most frequently made with the right arm.
But should the speaker stretch his arms towards
the audience, when he begins to speak, he should
take the second position.


## p. 8 (#20) ###############################################

ELOCUTION.
Before commencing to speak, take a pretty deep
inhalation of breath; but do not let it be too
deep. Economise your breath, and never exhaust
it. At every pause take a full, noiseless, even
inhalation ; and at every rhetorical pause, which I
shall explain further on, take a short inhalation ;
otherwise the lungs will become exhausted and at
last injured, while the process of breathing will be
spasmodic. The expulsion of the air in speaking
should be made, not so much by the descent of the
thorax or wall of the chest, as by the ascent of
the diaphragm or base of the chest. The breath
is thus more evenly expelled, and the sound can
be kept up for a longer time. Avoid gasping, or
drawing in the breath with perceptible effort.
“ The natural and free development of tone,' says
Bach, “depends, above all, on the difficult art of
correct inspiration and expiration. Breath must be
drawn completely at ease, without fits or starts, and
quite noiselessly, until even the lower parts of the
lungs are completely full with air. Many persons
spoil their very first note by singing it over-hastily,
even before they have done drawing a breath ; whilst
the formation of the tone must begin only with the
expiration, which likewise must be executed with the
greatest possible ease and gentleness. It does not
depend upon the great volume of ejected air. On
the contrary, too much breath makes the note un-
certain and unsteady. Flat singing is generally due
to this mistake. The vocal cords are weakened by

BREATHING.
9
such forcible expulsion of the breath, the tone
becomes hard and the throat is injured. The singer
must rather carefully husband the air deeply drawn
into the lungs and must give it out only gradually.
To convince yourself in the simplest way of the
correctness of my view, try to whistle. If we force
too much air against the edges of our lips, or drive a
violent breath on them, we produce either no tone at
all, or only a very unpleasant one. If, on the other
hand, very little air, and this but gently, touch our
lips, we shall often hear notes such as singing
birds can produce.
Even when singing
fortissimo, we must avoid throwing the full breath on
the windpipe, but rather regulate and check it by
holding it in ; for it is a delusion to believe that the
strongest breath produces the loudest sound. Lavish
expenditure or forcing of the breath on the windpipe
will by no means achieve a real sonorous, rich forte.
This must rather be produced by setting a com-
paratively small volume of breath into the greatest
possible vibration and resonance within the throat
and mouth. A rich volume of voice is produced only
by a perfectly free flow of air through the larynx, and
is produced especially when the air strikes the
pharynx."
“The peculiarity of so many singers in producing
the higher notes of the chest-register by a greater
expenditure of breath and a pressure of the muscles
of the neck, is entirely wrong. It is a law in nature
that the larynx rises by the heightening and falls

by the deepening of the sound, but there should be
no pressure on the muscles of the neck, for thereby
the natural function of the larynx is hindered. A too
great expenditure of breath, or concussion of the
vocal cords, will be followed by screaming tones, and
not only that, but the vocal cords will in time lose
their elasticity, and with this their ability of vibrating.
This is the cause of the ruin of so many voices.”.
(Guttmann). And anyone regularly attending London
Theatres will find that the voices of most of the actors
and actresses are sensibly deteriorating, simply be-
cause they mistake noisy acting for forcible acting.
Observe and practice the following rule, which is of,
I may almost say, vital importance. When either
reading, speaking, or walking, and especially after
coming out of a hot room, the breath should, under
all circumstances, be inhaled into the lungs only
through the nostrils, never through the mouth, other-
wise the throat is rendered dry and apt to become
inflamed; while in damp weather the phlegm is much
more liable to accumulate in the throat, the result
being a hoarseness of speaking, which goes far to
destroy the effect of even a naturally good voice. In
order to keep purity of tone in the voice, both the
nostril and the throat must be kept clear of all
obstruction. A celebrated writer on Voice Culture
says :-" The importance of breathing through the
nose has never been sufficiently recognised. Vocalists
ought, in the morning, immediately after rising, to
bestow particular attention to their noses. I am in

the habit of using every morning as a nose-bath a
large tumblerful of tepid water, in which there is
dissolved a tablespoonful of table salt. This water is
gently drawn through the nostrils four or five times
in succession ; and I can earnestly recommend this
process to every vocalist. By these means all foreign
.
substances are removed, the air passages are cleared,
and it is a truly agreeable sensation to be able at once
in the morning to inhale freely through the nostrils
the fresh air.”
As soon as the mouth is open, that is at the
moment of expiration, seize the sound, so as not to
lose valuable breath. In this way you also produce
a more distinct sound than you would otherwise do.
The management of the lungs in speaking and singing
is an art, in which one becomes efficient only after
careful training. Breathing, in combination with
vocalization and articulation, are one and all required
by one who aspires to become a good speaker or
singer. Unless a person knows how to manage the
breath, the result is the use of too much force in
breathing, which strains the vocal organs. Breathing
well consists in the harmonious performance of two
separate actions-inspiration, or taking in breath i
and expiration, or giving out breath. In taking in
breath, in order to get a good supply, we must
employ, not only the upper portion of the lungs, but
also the diaphragm. A bad reader or speaker never
inhales enough, and always exhales too much and too
fast. He is unable to store it up, with the inevitable

result of being under the necessity of constantly
catching at his breath, a trick so well known as
gasping
A great deal of twaddle, not to say empiricism,
is talked about Voice Production. A voice cannot
be produced unless it exists, but it can be improved -
wonderfully and effectively—by simply practising
the correct system of breathing. Herein lies the
whole art of voice-production. All breathing, whether
in singing, in speaking, or in every-day life,
should be abdominal and not clavicular, which last
is totally vicious and can really only be produced
by a kind of struggle. This style of breathing,
moreover, besides being injurious, is ungraceful, as
it necessarily compels the moving up and down of
the shoulders, which should be kept immovable. If
any difficulty is found, at first, in getting rid of this
bad habit, the result only of bad teaching, the pupil
should practise breathing under a couple of ledges,
which will prevent his shoulders from rising, and thus
compel him to adopt the proper style of breathing.
Guttmann, one of the greatest authorities on the
Voice, says :-“Every singer, or speaker, should
,
breathe as far as possible through the nose, and
should make use of every opportunity that presents
itself for doing so. But where is there such an
opportunity? Wherever he has two or three seconds'
time, which is quite ample for a full inspiration. But
in inspiring through the nose, we should not move
the muscles as though we wished to smell ; this

13
checks the air which is to be inhaled and becomes
unpleasantly audible.”' A late well-known teacher
of Elocution was famous for this disagreeable and
unnatural style of breathing, "Inspiration should
be performed solely with the inspiratory muscles
(the diaphragm and the external intercostals), the
nostrils to be used only as openings for the passage
of the air. We should also be careful not to
compress the lips wliile inspiring through the
nostrils. Compressing the lips tightly reduces the
openings of the nostrils, by which inspiration is
rendered infinitely more difficult, and a noise is pro-
duced as in audible smelling. If we are compelled,
by rapid singing or speaking, to breathe through the
mouth, it is quite necessary in inspiration to hold
the tongue convexly towards the palate, as in pro-
nouncing E (as in he), as the air is thus prevented
by the narrowed cavity of the mouth from striking
directly against the vocal chords, and there is much
less danger of the mucous membrane becoming dry."
In connection with this I will allude to the soft
palate, which plays an important part. “It is a
movable curtain at the back of the hard palate, or
roof of the mouth. When a deep inspiration is taken
through the mouth, it will be felt that this soft palate
is forced backward until it touches the back wall of
the throat, the pharynx; but when the inspiration is
taken in through the nose, it will be felt that the
soft palate moves forward somewhat, so as to leave a
considerable space between it and the pharynx, in

order that the air can pass by this route into the
larynx.”
Some authorities say that, owing to this action of
the soft palate, it is unnecessary to shut the mouth in
order to breathe through the nose ; but, with all due
deference to them, I have no hesitation in stating
that, to say nothing of the long and not always
successful practice which would be required to
breathe always through the nose, the simplest,
shortest, most easily practised and safest plan is,
to bring the tongue into play as an assistant to the
natural action to the soft palate. It is thus that a
much greater quantity of air can be inhaled than by
the ordinary, and with some persons disagreeably-
sounding, system of inhaling through the nose alone.
Some writers on Elocution claim great credit for
advising that breathing exercises should be practised
when lying on the flat of the back. To me, the
superiority of this plan is very doubtful, inasmuch
as the breathing apparatus is then in a different
position to what it is when the person is standing up.
and therefore, it may be that the organs are exercised
in different ways and to different degrees. The only
merit-and it is one
that is almost altogether
overlooked—is that it necessitates the adoption and
practice of the right mode of breathing, viz., from the
abdomen, and not from the shoulders.
Having borne these rules in mind, we now come to

speech all the simple and compound sounds which
our twenty-six letters represent. The end of Oratory
is to persuade. We cannot persuade unless we are
first clearly understood; we cannot be understood
unless we utter our words with distinctness, correct-
ness, ease and elegance. A clear and distinct
articulation atones for many things; but nothing can
make up for the want of it. Its importance cannot
be over-estimated. Slovenly articulation is mis-
spelling to the ear; and is as great a blemish as
false spelling in any writing. “A good articulation,”
says Sheridan, “consists in giving every letter in a
syllable its due proportion of sound, according to the
most approved custom of pronouncing it; and in
making such a distinction between the syllables, of
which the words are composed, that the ear shall,
without difficulty, acknowledge their number, and
perceive, at once, to which syllable such letter
belongs. Where these points are not observed, the
articulation is proportionally defective." Open the
mouth well, in order to attain the quality of round-
ness, fulness and clearness. Articulate clearly and
fully, and let the words be begun and ended crisply
and cleanly. They should not be hurried over
or drawled, or permitted to slip out carelessly, or
to drop unfinished, They must not be pronounced
in such a manner as is, unfortunately, not un-
common on the part of those who have been badly
taught, namely, by introducing unnecessary sounds
between the words, e.g., “flashing-ah like-ah a sun.

lit-ah gem-ah.” Let the lips perform their due share
in the process of articulating, otherwise the sounds
will not be distinct. A distinct and perfect articula-
tion, besides being of importance as regards the
expression, also enables the speaker to dispense with
mere loudness, which would not only exhaust his own
strength, but annoy the ears of his audience. This
is particularly the case in buildings which are afflicted
with an echo. There you must be very distinct and
slow, and pause frequently, so as to allow the waves
of the air to subside. In fact, always adapt and
proportion your voice, not only to the size of the
place in which you speak, but also to its acoustic
properties. Do not drop the voice at the end of
a sentence, with the result of becoming almost
inaudible. The voice should be sustained not only
throughout the words, but throughout the sentence to
the very end. No part of a sentence is of more
importance than the close, both in respect of sense
and harmony. Don't imitate the clergyman who is
said to have announced that he intended, on the
following Sunday, to preach on “the aspects of hell ”;
and when the time came was obliged to confess to an
unusually crowded congregation, that what he really
meant was “the aspects of health.” Only four con-
sonants permit of prolonged sound-1, m, n, r. With
these exceptions, the voice should rest only and at due
length on the vowels, and all other consonants should
be struck suddenly and pronounced rapidly, but full.
Always pronounce clearly, cleanly and distinctly the

down, etc. Be careful to sound the prefixes and
terminations clearly ; e.g., admit, not 'dmit, ambition,
not 'mbition, thinking, not thinkin, etc. Unless words
are clearly articulated, confusion and uncertainty will
result, e.g., d and j when followed by u are frequently
confounded. “The Duke paid the money due to the
Jew, before the dew was off the ground; and the Jew,
having duly acknowledged it, said adieu to the Duke
for ever." Don't run the words into each other. The
first direction which that great actress, Mrs. Siddons,
used to give her pupils was, “Take time.” Throw as
it were each syllable into the ear of the most remote
individual in the audience, and give it time to be
heard before the utterance of its successor. The
smallest and least important word in a sentence or
discourse, if worth uttering at all, is worth uttering
audibly. Rapidity of utterance is destructive of
expression, of distinctness and sometimes even of
meaning Practice on the following sentences :
Heaven's first star (not fir star); The supply lasts still
(not lasts till); I see the panting spirit sigh (not spirit's
eye); To obtain neither (not obtain either); Would

1.8., The works of the age of Pericles lie at the foot of
the Acropolis in indiscriminate ruin.
Begin rather under the ordinary pitch of your voice
than above it, as it is easier to raise than to lower the
pitch, and always speak in your own natural voice.
Don't assume an artificial one, or try to imitate some
one else. If you have not naturally a good voice, do
your best, under proper supervision, to improve it and
correct its faults; but let it always be your own and
your natural voice.
The voice can be raised at will to any pitch of
which it is capable ; but it requires great skill and
practice to lower it when once it is raised too high.
Just as dangerous is the other extreme. The lower
notes always tend to infuse monotony, gloom, dulness,
heaviness, and a certain amount of indistinctness.
“By mingling the low notes with the two other
registers" (i.e., the middle and the high), says
Legouvé, “my father at last succeeded in reaching
that natural variety of intonations which is at once a
charm for the hearer and a rest for the speaker.”
In connection with articulation is Pronunciation,
which is a most important element, and which ought
to be such as is used in the ordinary conversation of
educated and well-bred persons, who are sure to have
no peculiarities, vulgarisms, or false and vicious pro-
vincialisms of accent. Custom is, no doubt, the
arbiter of what is correct; but then it must be the
custom of the educated, not the uneducated, or worse

among these are to be found some professed Teachers
of Elocution. I have been present when such men
have allowed their pupils to pronounce the words just
as they please, some one way and some another, with-
out atteinpting to correct them, either because they
do not know better, or because they are afraid that a
possible reference to a dictionary might expose their
ignorance of the most elementary principle of their
art. As the late Mr. Sergeant Cox, an able writer,
says :-“ Some Teachers of Elocution profess to pre-
scribe rules for the guidance of the pupil, which may
be correct in themselves, but the observance of which
would certainly make the reader who tries to observe
them an ungainly pedant, and his reading a positive
pain to his audience.” Another writer says "If
anyone you know has had greater opportunity than
you have had of making himself acquainted with the
elegant mode of pronunciation, you ought not to be
ashamed of asking his advice, whenever you entertain
doubt respecting the proper pronunciation of any
word ; and if you can persuade him to be present
whenever you speak in public, for the purpose of
setting down those words which you pronounce wrong,
and afterwards tell you of them, you will probably be
able, in a short time, to correct yourself in such
improprieties, and bring your speech to that polish
and refinement, to attain which is one of the most
important objects that can possibly engage your
attention."
The Stage, one of the leading dramatic papers, has

repeatedly alluded to this subject, and recommended
actors to pay more attention to what is so important.
If actors, or vocalists, or reciters do not choose to
learn to pronounce correctly, they should, at least, see
that their pronunciation is uniform. I myself have
heard such words as the following pronounced within
the space of a few minutes, Genoa or Gen-ba, aconīte
or aconitě, quiétus, quiētus. But the most amusing
instance of varied pronunciation is the following:
A party of London glee singers met another from
Yorkshire, and to these were joined a third party from
Lancashire. The Londoners struck up with We flee
by Night, from the Witch's Glee in Macbeth, being
followed by the Yorkshiremen with "We floy by
noight,' the Lancashire men responding with 'We flee
by neet.''
“ Articulation, accent and correct pronunciation,
purity of tone and pitch of voice, however, should be
taught among the elements of education, that is,
before the more advanced stage of expressive reading
or of public address is taken up as a special study.
When this is accomplished, the teacher of elocution
will have the advantage enjoyed by the teacher of
music. His pupils will know, as it were, the notes
of speech, and he will have but to dictate their use
and direct the learner in their execution in the inter-
pretation of an author's language."
After distinct articulation and correct pronun-
ciation, comes EXPRESSION, which deals with groups
of words and the sense expressed by them when

combined in sentences. The basis of expression, of
course, depends on a right understanding of the
meaning of the sentence—the bringing out the sense
and sentiment of what is read or spoken-in the
clearest, fullest, most pleasing, most appropriate and
most effective manner. It has been well called the
soul of oratory, for without it reading, speaking, or
reciting is unmeaning—yox et præterea nihil.
I have had arguments with many persons, some of
them even Teachers of Elocution, as to the possibility,
or, as they declare, the impossibility of teaching
expression. I unhesitatingly assert that it can be
taught. I admit that every person cannot be taught
the same amount of expression; but everyone has a
soul, and it is the business of a teacher to get at that
soul, to drag it out if necessary.
But I equally
admit that a teacher can do this, only if he is of a
sympathetic nature, and is capable of inspiring at
least a certain an unt of interest and enthusiasm ;
or, as Sir Morell Mackenzie, in his able work, “The
Hygiene of the Vocal Organs,” says, “The elocution-
master should possess at least some amount of that
indefinable moral force known as personal magnetism.”
Of course, I am here assuming that the teacher really
knows what he professes, because it is a melancholy
fact, that, as an American writer says, “outside of
patent medicines, there is no humbug so great as
characterises nine-tenths of elocutionary teaching."
In connection with this I quote another passage
from Sir M. Mackenzie. He is speaking specially

of training the voice in connection with singing, but
his remarks apply with equal force to all kinds of
teaching. “It is not every one who can sing, or who
knows what good singing is, that is fit to teach the
art. In addition to the qualifications which all true
instructors should possess—thorough knowledge of
the subject, wide experience, sound judgment, clear-
ness of thought and expression, sympathetic insight,
personal enthusiasm and the power of kindling it in
others, combined with the patience of Job and the
energy of Hercules—the singing-master must have,
of course, the special qualities of his craft. The
question is often debated whether the master should
himself be a singer or not. Teachers naturally argue
the question from the stand-point of their own
personal gifts. At first sight, one is disposed to
say that a singing-master who cannot sing is like the
dancing-master spoken of by Swift, who had every
good quality except that he was lame. This view,
however, is really a fallacy akin to 'Who slays fat
oxen should himself be fat.' A singing-master must
.
be able to sing at least well enough to exemplify his
own precepts and show his pupils how to produce the
voice and how not. He need not, however, be a
brilliant performer ; indeed, I believe several of the
most successful voice-trainers of the day have them-
selves little or none of the divine gift which they
cultivate in others. The greatest practical adepts in
any art are not by any means always the best
teachers of it, not merely from the lack of the

23
necessary patience, but from want of the power of
imparting knowledge. The hone, which, although it
cannot cut, can sharpen the razor; the finger-post that
shows the way, which itself can never go, are
emblems of the teacher.
“ This may at first sight, seem to be a very humble
function, but it must be borne in mind that the
instruction of others is as much an art sui generis as
that of singing itself, and it is only by a fortunate
coincidence that the capacity for both may sometimes
be found in the same individual.
" I hope that I shall not be understood as arguing
that the less vocal ability a man has the better he is
fitted for teaching. In arts which are learnt only by
imitation, the instructor must of course be, to a great
extent, a model. But apart from the fact that
geniuses in their own right are seldom safe exemplars
for less gifted mortals, and that their very superiority
would be likely to overwhelm and dishearten their
disciples, there would often seem to be a real
incompatibility between practical excellence and
theoretical knowledge, or the power of communi-
cating it. This arises from the radical difference
between the synthetic, or constructive, and the
analytic, or critical type of mind. Thus learned
grammarians are, as a rule, inelegant writers, and
profound physiologists are not seldom indifferent
doctors. Poets are by no means the best judges of
verse, while the Pegasus of critics is too often of the
Rosinante breed.”

Expression depends for its effectiveness on our
attending, first of all, to four points :-(1) Inflection,
(2) Modulation, (3) Emphasis, (4) Pause.
(1) By Inflections—the proper use, or the want, of
which marks the good and intelligent reader from the
uneducated or ill-taught reader—are meant, not the
loudness or softness of the voice, which may accom-
pany any pitch, but simply the ascents and descents
of the voice, the slides from a lower to a higher, or
from a higher to a lower key, which the voice makes
when the pronunciation of a word is ending, as
distinguished from the monotone ; e.g., Do I rise or
fàll ? " So important is a just mixture of the two
inflections, that, the moment they are neglected, our
delivery becomes forceless and monotonous." In
the Rising Inflection the movement of the voice is
from grave to acute. It carries on the attention of
the hearer to what is to follow, and thus denotes
incompleteness of statement. The Falling Inflection
is from acute to grave. It directs the attention of the
hearer to what has been said, and denotes complete-
ness of statement. It is also used for the purpose of
emphasis, giving more importance to a word than the
rising inflection. The rising inflection is used at the
end of the penultimate member of a sentence, or
succession of sentences, in order to prepare a cadence
for the close of the sentence, e.g., “Quit ye like mén,
be stròng.”
Sentences which follow in the same train of thought
are connected by the rising inflection, e.g., "Cast thy

bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after
many dàys."
Interrogative sentences, beginning with verbs, to
which the simple answer, “Yes,” or “No," can be
returned, end with a rising inflection, e.g., “Did he
say he would come?" "Is the doctor at home ?"
“Can this be true?" "Is this the noble Moor whom
” “
our full senate call all in all sufficient ?” “Is a candle
to be put under a búshel or under a béd?" (Here
the words are in apposition, that is, they have the
same relative meaning. It is usually read with the
falling inflection on bed, as if there was no alternative.
But the real question, as shown by the natural answer,
is—“Is a candle brought to be hid under a búshel, or
under a béd (or a táble, or a cháir]?” “Nò; it is
;
brought to give light.")
Interrogative sentences, beginning with pronouns
or adverbs, or to which some definite answer must be
given, end with the falling inflection, e.g., “Why was I
born to taste this depth of woe ?." "Why do you
not answer me?" “Who told you he was sick ?”
“ Where is the man ?"
When interrogative sentences, or clauses, are con-
nected by the disjunctive "or," expressed or implied,
the questions which precede the “or," end on the
"
rising inflection, and those which follow end on the
falling inflection, e.g., "Shall we advance or retreat ? "
“
“Will you ride or walk?”“ Do the perfections of the

He possessed them nót? Or, are they not rather in

)
continual exercise ?" If the “or” is used conjunc-
tively, it has the same inflection both before and after
it, e.g., “Can wealth, or honour, or pleasure satisfy the
soul ?” “Would it make worse parents or children,
húsbands or wives, másters or servants, friends or
neighbours, or [here, disjunctively), would it not
make men more virtuous, and, consequently, more
happy ?"
Supplicating, or appealing, sentences usually take
the rising inflection throughout, and the voice is
usually more or less high in pitch ; but in sad or
solemn appeals the pitch of voice is low, e.g., "Píty
me; hear my supplications !” Affirmative sentences
take the falling inflection. All sentences, or members
of sentences, which are negative in structure, and in
which the negative is emphatic, generally end with
the rising inflection, c.g., “I come not, friends, to steal
your hearts."
Antithetic sentences, that is, those
sentences in which the words or clauses are opposed
or contrasted to each other in meaning, must be read
with an opposition of inflection, and in different
degrees of modulation; and the first part must
generally end with the rising inflection, e.g., "He did
not call me but you.” “ Men's evil manners live in
bráss; their virtues we write in water."
• We are
always complaining our days are féw, and acting as
though there should be no end to them.” “A friend

Sentiments of great animation and vivacity take

the rising inflection. Grave and earnest sentiments
take generally the falling inflection. Anger, hatred,
detestation, etc., take the falling inflection, and the
voice, though loud in power, is pitched in the lowest
key. Gloom, dejection, melancholy, etc., take the
falling inflection and the time is slow. Emotions of
pleasure or tender emotion take a rising inflection,
and the voice is usually pitched in keys more or less
high; but where tenderness, pity, or pathos mingle
with the affection, the voice is modulated into a softer
key. Wonder amazement, surprise, take the rising
inflection, and the voice is usually pitched in a very
high tone, unless awe, dread, or terror mingle with
the emotion, when the voice is more or less low.
Authority, command, reprehension, or denunciation
take the falling inflection, e.g., “Swear not at all.”
"Be ready, as your lives shall answer it.” “ Ye
blocks, ye stones, ye worse than senseless things."
A parenthesis suspends the sense. A parenthetic
sentence must always be pronounced differently from
its relative sentence (generally more rapidly and in a
lighter tone), and conclude with the same time, pitch,
and inflection of voice which terminates the member
that immediately precedes it, eg, “Know ye not,
brethren (for I speak to-them that know the law),
that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
liveth.” “Laying his hand upon his bréast (a slender
white staff with which he journeyed being in his
right), he introduced himself.” When the parenthesis
contains an emphatic word, the falling inflection is

danger of losing his health and character."
parenthesis is long, it may be pronounced with a
degree of monotone or sameness of voice, e.g.,

“ His spéar (to equal which the tallest pine

Of some great Admiral, were but a wand),

"
Parenthetic sentences are preceded and followed by
a pause sufficient to give them an isolated and
independent character. The small intervening words
" says he," " said the man," " added the speaker,"
must be read without modulation, following the
inflection of the member which precedes them.
The Monotone, when judiciously used, is very
expressive. It adds wonderful force and dignity to
the delivery of passages of a solemn and elevated
character, or where emotions of sublimity, awe,
or terror are expressed ; and is very
applicable to the reading of many parts of the Holy
Scriptures and the Church Services.

The Circumflex, or Compound, inflection, is a union
of the rising and falling inflection, ascending and
descending in what may be described as a wave of
the voice, and is generally used in vehement and un-
restrained utterance, or in the expression of contempt,
sarcasm, derision, contrast, or reproach, but especially
in irony, e.g., “Hear him, my Lords, he is wondrous
condescênding.” “Sell my field to you? I would not
"
sell it to the King.” In Marc Antony's oration over
the body of Cæsar, great effect may be added to the
oft-repeated epithet "honourable man" (which is
applied ironically), by the adoption of this compound
inflection.
An Exclamation, consisting of a word, requires the
rising inflection; but the entire exclamatory clause
ends with the falling inflection, e.g., “Oh, Róme! oh,
my country! how art thou fållen."
“ Hark! hárk-it is the clash of arms- s—the bells begin to toll-
He is coming ! he is coming !-God's mercy on his soul."
Echo is that repetition of a word, or thought, which
immediately arises from a word, or thought, that
preceded it. The echoing word ought always to be
pronounced with a rising inflection in an increased
tone of voice, with a long pause after it, eg., " And
this fellow calls himself a painter. A páinter! He
is but fit to daub the sign of a country ale-house."
When very emphatic, the falling inflection is preferable,

Is the art of harmonious expression. It is the passing,
not from one note to another, but from one key to
another. There is nothing which contributes more to
the pleasure of an audience, nothing which gives
stronger proof that an orator is master of his art, than
a well-regulated and expressive modulation. It
should, however, not be resorted to merely for the
sake of variety, but should always be subservient to
the sense. A change of modulation should take place
at all changes of style—at the commencement of every
paragraph-and in parenthetical- clauses or sentences.
It should also be used to distinguish question and
answer, or the different speakers in a dialogue.

pitch or key, which may be either high or low, accord-
ing to the nature of the subject. The voice has been
assumed capable of assuming three such keys—the
low, the high, the middle. From these, the inflections
may proceed upwards or downwards, ranging from
the various degrees of intonation necessary to express
the different shades of passion or emotion. A dis-
tinction must be drawn between the two sets of terms,
high and low, loud and soft. The latter, like the forte
and piano in music, denote merely the degree of force
or volume of sound which may be deemed necessary
to use in the same key ; while the former refer to the
degrees of pitch, or acuteness, and gravity of sounds.
Pitch is consequently independent of Force, though
Force frequently adds much to the effect of pitch.
The Low Tone falls below the usual speaking key
and is employed in expressing feelings “deeper” than
ordinary—fear, secrecy, grief, sorrow, solemnity, deep-
seated feeling, gloom, melancholy, and concentrated
passion; and also in the softest and deepest expression
of love and veneration.
The Middle Tone is the tone of habitual utterance
or address unmarked by passion, and is used in
ordinary conversation, narration, moral reflection,
descriptive statement, or calm reasoning.
The High Tone is that which rises above the usual
speaking key, and is used in expressing elevated and
joyous feelings, strong emotions, and impetuous, im-
pulsive passion. Joy, exultation, rage, invective,
eagerness, threat-all speak in a high pitch. It

is also proper for stirring description or animated
narration.
The Orotund voice, by using which a much greater
volume of sound is produced than when only the lip
voice is used, and which is peculiarly fitted for the
expression of grand and sublime language, is pro-
duced by the same organic form and action of the
mouth as are necessary perfectly to enunciate the
letter O. It is acquired by speaking farther back in
the mouth, causing the voice to reverberate more.
It should be sedulously cultivated by all public
speakers and, especially, by clergymen.
It must,
however, be carefully distinguished from the "high
tone,” which is an elevation of pitch, and also from
" loudness,” or “strength,” of voice.
Time is the rate of utterance. The great difficulty
is to be slow and not to seem slow, to speak distinctly
without appearing to drag the words, and to speak
quickly without appearing to hurry. Generally, ex-
planatory clauses should be pronounced in quicker
tone and higher key, while parenthetical clauses
should be pronounced in quicker time and lower key,
than the other clauses of a sentence. Time may be
considered under three heads-quick, moderate, and
slow. Quick time is used to express joy, mirth,
raillery, passion, violent anger and excited states
generally. Moderate time is used in narration, de-
scription, argument and unimpassioned speech. Slow
time is used to express deep feeling, awe, dignity,
meditation, deliberation, grief, veneration and solemn

The next quality is Force, or Intensity, which is
inseparable from Earnestness. It is the invariable
characteristic of the speaker who, in treating of
important or momentous matters, is himself alive to
his subject, and whose feelings are interested in what
he is uttering. Where life and soul and true passion
are, there must be force both of voice and action ; but
this does not mean loudness or violence.
Force depends upon the pressure of the breath. . It
is an entirely different quality from modulation or
pitch. A low key may be accompanied by extreme
force, or a high key by feeble force. Force, under

proper management, gives volume and dignity,
whether the tones be high or low. Force relates
to space and power; loudness relates to distance. ,
The next point to be noticed is
(3) EMPIIASIS.
The importance of it is such that, if it is not placed
on the correct word, the meaning of the passage will
be completely altered, e.g., “Pilate saith unto them,
Take ye Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in
Him," i.e., Pilate desired them to do, as their own act
and on their own responsibility, what he himself saw
no reason for doing. But if the emphasis be placed
not on “ye,” but on fault,” the sense would be that
Pilate told them to crucify Jesus because he was
persuaded of His innocence. Every sentence, or
expression of thought, has some principal word, or
words, which should be emphasized or rendered
prominent by superior accent or stress. Emphasis
points out the real meaning of a sentence. It has
the power to make long and complex sentences
appear intelligible and perspicuous; but an excess of
it must be avoided.
Emphasis is either “absolute” or “relative.” The
former occurs in the utterance of a single thought or
feeling of great energy; the latter, in the correspon-
dence, or contrast, of two or more ideas. Absolute
emphasis is either “impassioned” or “distinctive."
“
The former expresses strong emphasis; but the latter

35
"
designates objects, e.g., " The fall of man is the main
object of Milton's great poem.”
“Relative" emphasis
occurs in words which express comparison, corres-
pondence, or contrast, e.g., Cowards die many times;
the brave but once.
Words may be emphasized in various ways : by
an increased stress on the emphatic word; by varying
the inflection, to denote antithesis, doubt, etc.; by
varying the time, that is, lengthening or shortening the
word ; by altering the pitch to express any sudden
emotion, or changing from one note to another; by
the monotone, to give expression to sublime or solemn
passages; by the pause.
A repetition of emphatic words, or phrases, requires
a rising inflection, accompanied by increased force of
utterance, c.8.,“ You ruined my son. You, Sir!" In
the climax of a sentence there is a gradual increase
of emphatic force in the voice to the end, the last
clause being accompanied by a pause before each
member. When any word, or phrase, is made use of
for the purpose of expressing some particular meaning,
not arising obviously from the words, it should be
marked by a strong emphasis, eg, "TO BE, contents
his natural desire."
In order to exemplify the difference in the meaning
of a sentence by emphasizing certain words, I will
give three examples :—“Of man's first disobedience
Brought death into the world." Ву
emphasizing “man's,” we imply that there were
originally other beings besides man who had disobeyed

)
the command of the Almighty. By emphasizing
first,” we imply that mankind had transgressed more
than once. By emphasizing “death,” we imply that
death had before been an unheard of punishment, but
had been brought upon man in consequence of his
sins. If we emphasize “ world,” we imply that
mankind knew there was such an evil in other
regions, but that the place which they inhabited had
been free from it till their transgression.
Will you go to town to-day? i.e., Will you, or will
you not go. Will you go to town to-day? i.e., Will
you, or somebody else go. Will you go to town
to-day ? i.e., Will you go, or will you stay. Will you
go to town to-day ? i.e., Will you go to, or from, town.
Will you go to town to-day ? i.e., to town, or to some-
where else. Will you go to town to-day ? i.e., to-day
or some other day.
"Perdition catch my soul but I do love thee." If
the word “love” is emphasized, as it usually is, the
peculiar force and beauty of the line are lost; but
if the word “do” is emphasized, the vehemence
of the speaker's affection is much better marked,
signifying, as it then does, an act of the strongest
affirmation.
The following are given as among the answers
which I have, at times returned to correspondents,
whose guides have, in too many cases, been leaders-
or misleaders of the blind.
In the following passage the emphasis is on the
words italicised :—“ Oh, now you weep, and I perceive

"
you feel the dint of pity.--These are gracious drops.
Kind souls! What! weep you when you but behold
our Cæsar's vesture wounded ? Look you here ?-
here is himself-marred, as you see, by traitors."
In the following the emphasis is not on “men
(which would imply that you may quarrel with
women), but on “all” (i.e., all mankind). “As much
as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”
In “Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath
Day," the emphasis is not on “day," as that would
imply that the “ night” might be differently occupied,
but on “ Sabbath."
It was all very well for Sydney Smith, on one
occasion, to give out as his text_“Oh that men
would praise the Lord," when there were only three
men present. He was a born humorist, and the
occasion was exceptional. But it is dangerous to
imitate such a man, and would be apt to lead to
unfavourable comparisons. The emphatic words in
the verse are "praise and “wonders.” “ Oh that
men would praise the Lord for His goodness, and
declare the wonders He doeth for the children of
men.”
As a general rule, however, the use of the Rhetorical
Pause is preferable to emphasis, as not only not
necessitating an undue effort with the voice, but as
enabling the speaker to regain breath.
(4) THE RHETORICAL PAUSE.
This pause differs from the grammatical pause in

this, that the latter refers to the synthetical structure
of a sentence, and is addressed to the eye of the
reader; while the rhetorical pause is one which is
addressed to the understanding "through the porches
of the ear.” It is independent of, though consistent
with and assistant to, the grammatical pause. The
first leading principle of rhetorical punctuation is
keeping together the groups of words between stops,
and not mixing up a word of one group with the
preceding or subsequent group.
The duration of
pauses must be regulated by the nature of the
composition, and by the conception, feeling and aim
of the speaker. They are long in solemn, short in
lively, style. Without thein, the most solemn passage
of Scripture, and also the poetry of Milton, produce
no effect, comparatively, on the mind; while reading,
aided by their “expressive silence," seems
“
"
to be
inspired with an unlimited power over the sympathies
of the soul.*
One of the worst faults a speaker can have is to
make no other pauses than what he finds barely
necessary for breathing. I know of nothing that
such a speaker can so properly be compared to, as an
* The value of pauses was once exemplified in a somewhat humorous
fashion, Alluding to the expediency of registering a short telegraphic
address for “ The House of Commons," a Member created great
laughter by omitting the pause and saying-—-“Could we not say, sir,
Short Commons ?” On another occasion, an actor gave an entirely
wrong meaning to two words, by neglecting a pause. When “ Dull,"
a constable, entered and asked, “ Which is the Duke's own person ?"
the actor replied, pointing to the King, “ This fellow.”

alarm bell, which, when once set agoing, clatters on
till the weight that moves it is run down. Without
pauses, the sense must always appear confused and
obscure, and often be misunderstood ; and the spirit
and energy of the piece must be wholly lost.
It is by
no means sufficient to attend to the points used in
printing, for these are far from marking all the pauses
which ought to be made in speaking. A mechanical
attention to these has been one chief cause of
monotony. In reading, it may often be proper
to make sometimes a considerable pause where the
grammatical construction requires none at all."
The correct reading of a passage often depends on
this pause, as, for example, the following lines from
the speech of Shylock :-
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me.”
It may be read either-
Signor Antonio, many a time and of
In the Rialto you have rated me.”
or in the following manner, which is the more effective
and rational way-
Signor Antonio, many a time--and oft
In the Rialto-you have rated me."

Again, Douglas is often made, by those who pay a
too slavish regard to punctuation, to the ruin of the

instead of
“ We fought and conquered—ere a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierced their chief.”
In the following, two different readings may be
given by altering the place of this pause.
“ Hang out your banners-on the outward walls,
The cry is—' Still they come.''
or The cry is still—“ They come.”
The last is, perhaps, the preferable reading.
In making the pauses, the voice should be held
suspended to show that something is coming.
Pause after the nominative when it consists of more
than one word, e.g., " The fashion of this world
passeth away.” “To be virtuous | is to be happy.”
Pause after the emphatic word, or after each
member of a series, e.g., "Adversity | is the school of
piety." “And Nathan said unto David : Thou |
art the man." Charity | joy | peace | patience | are
Christian ornaments of the soul.”
Any clause or member of a sentence coming
between the nominative and the verb is of the nature
of a parenthesis, and must be separated from both by
a short pause, e.g., “Trials | in this state of being |
are the lot of men.” “ Talents without application
are no security for progress in learning.”
Pause after each adjective belonging to one sub-
stantive except the last, e.g., "Let but one brave
great | active | disinterested man arise.”
Pause wherever transposition of phrases may take

place, e.g., “Through dangers the most appalling | he
advanced with heroic intrepidity."
Pause before an adjective following its noun, e.g.,
“Her’s was a soul | replete with every noble quality.”
"He was a man | learned and polite."
Pause where an ellipsis, or omission of words, takes
place, e.g., "To your elders manifest becoming
deference, to your companions | frankness, to your
juniors | condescension.”
Pause before a verb in the infinitive, governed by
another verb, e.g., “The General now commanded his
reserve force 1 to advance to the aid of the main
body."
Words or phrases in opposition, or when the latter
only explains the former, have a short pause between
them, e.g., “He | raised a mortal to the skies. She
drew an angel down.” Hope | the balm of life |
soothes us under every misfortune."
Pause before relative pronouns, prepositions, con-
junctions, or adverbs used conjunctively, when followed
by a clause depending on them, e.g., “A Physician
was called in, who prescribed appropriate remedies.”
“Death is the season | which brings our affections to
the test." "Nothing is in vain that rouses the soul."
Pause before that when it is used as a conjunction,
as also before the adverbs when and whence, if used in
the same sense, e.g., “It is only in society that we
can relish these joys which embellish and gladden the
life of man.” “'Tis now the very witching hour of
night | when churchyards yawn.”

When a pause is necessary at conjunctions and
prepositions, it must be before, and not after them,

amusements.” “There is an inseparable connection |
between piety and virtue.”
The words but and hence, when standing at the
beginning of important clauses, require a pause after
them.
To give an important idea the greatest force, it is
necessary to pause a little before it, in order to pre-
pare the audience for it, and excite their attention ;
and it is necessary to pause a little after it, that it
may have time to sink into the minds of the hearers,
before another thought comes on.
“ In pausing, ever let this rule take place,
Never to separate words in any case
That are less separable than those you join ;
And, which imports the same, not to combine
Such words together, as do not relate

I HAVE hitherto dwelt on the Speaker rather than
on the Reader. But while the same rules naturally
hold good for both, the Reader has this one drawback,
that he must sometimes fix his eyes on his book. Let
him, therefore, accustom himself to gather in at a
glance an entire sentence or clause, and then let him
look at his audience, inasmuch as the eyes of a
Speaker have a wonderful effect in attracting and
detaining attention. “ There is a rhetoric in the eye.”
The expressive power of the human eye is so great,
that it determines, in a manner, the expression of the
whole countenance. Reading is necessarily inore
restrained than speaking, but it is advisable to cultivate
acute sensibility in both. Reading should have a dra-
matic character, which is not of necessity theatrical.
Animated, earnest, expressive reading, is not theatri-
cal. It is like the conversation of an earnest person,
thinking to himself aloud; but if overdone, the charm

and thus give the ruling passion or prevailing
sentiment." Strive that your reading shall seem as
little like reading, and as much like speaking, as
possible. “The objection to reading sermons, simply
because the preacher has never been taught the proper
style of reading, has seriously impaired their quality;
but the cure for bad reading is good reading, and, as
all men cannot be orators, they should be all the
more careful to read oratorically; and if students were
trained properly in this art, the sermons would
certainly become improved, and the preachers would
cease to be characterised as the most ineffective of
speakers.”
Dramatic Reading.—By this, says an able writer on
public speaking, I do not merely mean the reading of
the drama, whether it be or be not a drama in name
or form. Wherever there is dialogue there is drama.
Two human beings cannot be brought into communica-
tion without a drama being enacted. For the right
reading of dialogue you must, first, comprehend
distinctly the characters supposed to be speaking in
the drama. Next, you must thoroughly understand
the meaning of the words the author has put into
their mouths, that is to say, what thoughts those words
were designed to express. This fancy portrait will
suggest the manner of speaking. Then, clearly
comprehending the meaning of the words, and feeling
the emotions, and thinking the thoughts, you will
naturally utter them in the right tones and with the
true emphasis. Until you have attained to the ready

use of this faculty of personation, you cannot be a
good reader of dialogue.
A few words on Reading Verse, than which, as
De Quincey says, “ No accomplishment is so rare.”
It is evident that a thorough grasp of the meaning and
often the grammar of a sentence, as well as some little
practice, will be needed before the reader acquires the
habit of separating and grouping his words correctly.
Several amusing instances are recorded of the various
readings which have, on various occasions, been
popularly received in consequence of absurd errors in
this respect. For example, Macbeth has been made
to say :
“Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand ? No-these my hands will rather
The multitudinous sea incarnadine
Making the green-one- red.”
By reading it rationally and making the pause, as it
ought to be made, after "green"_" making the
green-one red”-we express the full power and
beauty of the thought. Another passage is :-
.
“ West of the town—a mile among the rocks-
Two hours ere noon to-morrow I expect thee."
Read thus, the idea is conveyed, if the words read
thus can convey any idea at all, that they would have
to scramble a mile over rocks, situated at the west of
the town, instead of the rational idea that the place of
meeting was among some particular rocks “west of
the town a mile."
The principal faults to be guarded against are :-

(1) A see-saw mode of reading the accented and
unaccented syllables. (2) The use of monotone, to
the prejudice of emphasis and expression. The
tone of the voice should be changed with every change
in the thought to be expressed. (3) The sing-song
recurrence of metre; the rhyme should always be
subordinated to the sense. (4) Emphasizing mono-
syllables, such as prepositions, articles, etc., having
regard more to sound than to sense. The article
“the” ought never to be too marked, even when
placed where the ear expects an accent.

A badly trained reader would lay the stress on
in the third line; but a good reader would transfer
the stress to the words “what” and “weak.” This
rule, however, with respect to the place of the accent,
admits of some few exceptions. Milton sometimes
places words so unfavourably for pronunciation in the
common way, that the ear would be more jarred by
the harshness of the verse, if the right accent was
retained, than with a wrong accent which preserves
the rhythm. Thus, in Paradise Lost, viii. 153, the
angel, reasoning with Adam about the planets, says :
“ For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul, desert and desolate,
Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute
Each orb," etc.

The word "contribute” has properly the accent on
the second syllable; but the verse would be so
harsh with this accent, that a good reader would, for
the sake of the rhythm, lay the principle accent on
the first syllable, and a subordinate stress on the
third.
In reading Blank Verse, care ought to be taken on
the one hand, not to end every line with a pause, and
on the other hand, not to run one line into another
more rapidly than if they were prose.
“Foremost of all,” says Lady Martin (Helen
Faucit), "care should be taken that actors of all
grades should have been trained to speak blank verse
correctly, and while giving the meaning to give the
music of it also. It is sad to see the reckless
ignorance which now prevails, and to note to what
a level of feebleness and commonplace the repre-
sentation of Shakespeare has, with some notable
exceptions, been reduced by that nerveless and
colourless thing, mistakably called 'natural acting.'
Thus it is that Shakespeare's plays are continually
being reproduced ; and yet their very essence is left
out, unheeded by the actors, and, alaş! as much
unheeded by the audience. Of what account is
elaborate scenery, or dresses that will satisfy the most
squeamish archæologist, if those who wear the one or
move about in the other are untrue to the characters
they profess to represent, and dead to the significance
and the beauty of the language they have to speak.”

THE Professional Musicians have formed themselves
into a National Society, one of the objects of which
is to confer on members a species of certificate as
to technical capacity. There are swarms of teachers
who are utterly ignorant of the very elements of
their art, and who bring disgrace upon what is
necessarily, in a certain sense, an educated and

cultivated profession.
Would that something of the kind could be done

take to heart the following sentence, applied to men
of higher standing and attainments than most of

than good teaching, and the majority of teachers
are no better than indifferent.” In proof of my
assertion that most of them are ignorant of what
they profess to teach, I will state that I have more
than once been told that in articulation and in-

them know practically as little as a hen knows of

of the Art of Elocution. Such qualities as expres-

They are right so far, that, unless a person has a
soul, all the teaching in the world will not put one

who aspires to become a public speaker, as for one
who wishes to be a vocalist, and to say the contrary
argues either ignorance or conceit. Diffidence is not
generally a vice inherent in human nature, but it
seems to be more conspicuous by its absence in those
who hold themselves out as reciters, than even in
vocalists, who certainly cannot be accused of a want of
self-assertion; because even the niost self-complacent
vocalist knows that at least a certain amount of
preliminary training is requisite, whereas the would be

ONE of his fighting heroes is described by the Greek
poet Homer as “sending his soul in every dart he
threw." He did not merely send or hurl the dart, but
he hurled it with all his soul and strength. I would
impress these words upon all who have to speak
before public audiences, whether as Members of
Parliament, Preachers, Lecturers, Actors, or Reciters.
Now, I am not going to depreciate Elocution. I
admit—nay, more, I maintain—that no one can be a
really good actor; no man can preach a sermon in
such a manner as to excite the interests of his hearers,
or leave any impression on their minds; no public
speaker, whether on the platform or in a court of
law, can persuade his hearers, or prepossess them;
no one can give a good poetical or prose recitation
in such a manner as to cause even the minimum
of pleasure, without being a good Elocutionist
What was thought of Elocution by Rachel, perhaps
one of the grandest actresses who ever appeared
on the French stage, is proved by the fact that she
studied with her Elocution Master, Legouvé, a certain
passage of thirty lines for three hours, until she had
mastered every shade of inflection, before she con-
sidered herself prepared to face her audience.

Clearness of articulation, modulation, right em-
phasis, proper inflections, correct pronunciation,
appropriate and graceful gestures, are all required
by public speakers. But, assuming that all these
necessary qualities have been acquired, there is
something more needed, and that is soul and ear-
nestness. The
most gifted actors and reciters,
unless they have soul, will fail to please as much
as they would otherwise do. I will assume that
there is not a single person who reads this who
has not, at least once in his or her life, got into
a passion. At all events, if anyone will deny
this, I will reply either that I do not believe
it, or else that such an abnormal and apathetic
nature is incapable of understanding, and still less of
appreciating, what I want to impress on my readers.
Well, have you not felt, at such a time, that you had
a strength and a force, and even an eloquence, of
which you had before not thought yourselves capable,
and at which you may even look back with surprise ?
Why is this? Simply because you had, for the
time, lost your usual phlegmatic condition; be-
cause your feelings were excited; because, in
short, you felt intensely. I must, however, remind
you that violence is not soul ; it is only physical
exertion. But intensity, being more of a mental
quality, is a very good imitation of soul, and, in fact,
necessarily implies a certain quantity of it.
Now, in acting and reciting--and in the following
remarks I speak more especially of those who practise

these Arts—you have to personate characters who
are supposed to be actuated by such various feelings
as kindness, love, anger, malice, jealousy, dignity, &c
Do not, then, act these various characters as if there
was but little difference between them ; do not act
them as if you were merely repeating words, or as
if you did not know or feel the difference between
the various characters you were depicting; but act
them as if you really felt what you were saying.
Loose yourself in your character. Put life and soul
and heart into your impersonations. I have heard
that soul-stirring poem, “The Revenge," recited in
such a listless and soulless manner as to excite no
feeling in me but indifference, or rather annoyance
that the reciter was not doing jnstice to the words
and the spirit of the poem. And I have heard the
“Defence of Lucknow"-which, with all due de-
ference, I consider too wordy and long-winded and
therefore losing, by so much, in point and firem
given in such a manner as to send, at one moment,
the blood to my cheeks, and, at another, the tears to
my eyes. But this sin of flabbiness is not confined
to Reciters. It is one of the greatest failings of
the Stage in the present. day. And so univeral
appears to be the craze on the part of Actors for
that “nerveless and colourless thing mistakenly
called 'natural acting'” that they refuse to recognise
the right of the public to what it can appreciate-

public greets any actor who displays animation and

vivacity seems to be beyond the comprehension of
those who think they know better what the public
ought to like than does the public itself. I have also
sometimes heard Actors say, "What is the use of
worrying myself about my part ? It is only a small
one;” or, “the others are such a set of duffers."
This is a mistake. No matter how small your part
may be, try to make the very most of it you can,
without, however, overdoing it. Try to play it as
well as ever you can. Your effort will, in the first
place, be recognised and appreciated by the audience
and the critics, and, in the second place, your effort
will most probably stimulate the others and cause
them to play up to you. Charles Reade, in noticing
some rather slighting criticisms on Foul Play, “as a
piece which was respectably written, but poorly

ELOCUTION
PULPIT ELOCUTION.
PASSIVE resistance is of all forces the most difficult to
overcome. This is, perhaps, most clearly seen in the
case of Elocution in the Pulpit. Clergymen generally
appear to be so absolutely convinced that whatever
they say there will be attentively, and ought to be
submissively, heard, that it but seldom occurs to them
to consider the manner in which it should be de-
livered. During any of the ordinations, how many
can read the prayers, or deliver a sermon with grace,
dignity, or impressiveness ? I will undertake to say
not five per cent.
The reading of the Liturgy and the Sermon present
too often a lamentable want of the very elements
of rational and intelligent reading or speaking.
Modulation is often ignored ; while the inflections are
mangled and distorted in the most reckless manner,
sometimes to the partial obscuring and even altera-
tion of the sense. At one church we hear the prayers
gabbled through ; at another, mumbled through ; at
a third, drawled through ; at a fourth, ranted through.
These defects are more noticeable in the Prayers ;
but in the Sermon they none the less exist, with one
of three results-either that few persons listen to the
Sermon; or that they are less impressed by it than
they would be if the preacher had a good delivery;
or that they stop away. As for the gestures which

I have seen in the pulpit, words fail me to describe
them.
Quite recently I attended the funeral of a man for
whom I had the greatest regard, but the Burial
Service-perhaps the most sublime composition in
the English language—was read in such a drawling,
soulless manner, as not to touch me at all; while
upon only one occasion have I really been moved by
the dignity, the pathos, the grace, which were infused
into that service by the reader. Among my latest
experiences of pulpit elocution was that of a clergy-
man-an able man, of good education and family-
who apparently did not know what to do with his
voice. His ideas of modulation and inflection were
so vague-if, indeed, he knew anything of them at all
as to render several of his sentences ludicrous,
while his reading of the prayers was such as to cause
one's attention, instead of being fixed on them, to be
distracted by a mental criticism of his mode of
reading them. Another clergyman seemed not to
know what to do with his body. For the first part
of the sermon, he stood leaning forward on his two
hands, an injurious as well as ungraceful attitude,
swaying and jerking his body about in the most
extraordinary and unmeaning manner. After warm-
ing to his work, he indulged in occasional gestures,
which were, in almost every case, both ungraceful and
wrong. If clergymen could only realise the feelings
of most of their auditors, they would, I should hope,
adopt the advice of some of the ablest and most

eloquent members of their own body-Rev. Charles
Simeon, Archbishop Thomson, Professors Blunt, Blair,
Rev. Dr. Guthrie, etc.-who have taken care to im-
press upon them advice similar to that given by Dr.
Johnson to a young clergyman—"Delivery is more
potential than eloquent matter." And the Rev. John
Wesley, the celebrated preacher, said: “Take care of
anything awkward or affected in your gesture, phrase,
or pronunciation.” The young divinity student spends
years in training his faculties and storing his mind
with knowledge of all kinds. The great object of his
life is to communicate thoughts to the minds of others,
to awaken their feelings, to arouse and direct the
determination of their wills. And yet the means by
which he can best carry out his views are sedulously
neglected. Of course, no amount of elocutionary study
will alone make a man a good preacher; but, assuming
that a young man has those attainments of mind and
alities of character which fit him for the ministry,
the study of Elocution, under an intelligent teacher,
will enable him to bring out, in an attractive form, the
thoughts and emotions which are already in his mind.
To overlook manner is a proof neither of piety,
a
dignity, nor wisdom. Until the preacher has this power
of expressing, through voice and manner, what is in
him, no matter how wise and good he may be, he will
be unfitted for his office. Indistinct articulation, false
tones, wrong emphasis, an undeveloped and im-
properly managed voice, a liſeless, unmeaning manner

and delivery, are to the preacher what bad grammar,
a scanty vocabulary, inelegant and confused sentences
are to an author. "Not one clergyman in a hundred,"
says an able writer, “can read a chapter correctly-
meaning by that term, with right expression of the
sense as distinguished from the graces of expression.
Not one in a thousand can read effectively as well as
correctly. So with the Prayer Book. How seldom
are the services delivered as they should be.
The services, recited so often, come so readily to the
lips of the clergyman, who reads them three or four
times a week, that there is a natural tendency to
utter them mechanically, without first passing them
through the mind. Hence the mannerisms of which
he is so unconscious. As once read, so they are
always, and if the habit be not early wrestled with, it
becomes incurable. The only remedy is the presence
of an inexorable critic, who shall stop you when you
are faulty, and make you repeat the sentence till you
read it rightly; or an able professional teacher, who
will not merely detect your errors, but show you how
you ought to read, and thus substitute his style for
yours. Mannerism is more frequent in reading the
Prayers than even in the reading of the Bible. The
groaning style is the favourite one. Why should it
be deemed necessary to address the Deity as if you
had a stomach-ache? Yet thus do ninety-nine out of
every hundred in the pulpit or in family prayer.
There is a tine of profound reverence most proper to
be assumed in prayer, and which, indeed, if the prayer

is felt at the moment of utterance, it is almost im-
possible not to assume. But that is very different,
indeed, from the sepulchral and stomachic sounds
usually emitted."
“One thing has been clearly demonstrated," says
the late Rev. Henry Christmas, F.R.S., Editor Church
of England Quarterly Review, “that if manner be not
of as much importance as matter, it ought at all events
not to be neglected. But is a good manner in the pulpit
a thing to be acquired? Can the stiff, dry, cold way of
one man be transformed into stately dignity; the
loose, slovenly, lounging deportment of another, into
graceful ease? Are there instructors who would be
of assistance in accomplishing such transformation ?
We reply to all these questions—Yes. Not, indeed,
in all cases, but in the great majority. A poor soil
may be cultivated, and a poor mind, within certain
limits, enriched. A person already placed in the
position of a clergyman, and for whom it is too
late to say, 'I am unfit for my office,' may yet be
rendered far more fit for the office than perhaps he
himself even suspects. It is understood that he is
a conscientious man ; that he studies, prays and
diligently performs those routine duties which some
exalt as being the loftiest and most important which
devolve upon him ; but he is discouraged by finding
his inefficiency in the pulpit so conspicuous as it is.
He is candid enough and intelligent enough to see
this, and earnest and faithful enough to deplore it,
Let not a man so situated despair. The case of

Demosthenes may comfort him, and the means used
by that greatest of orators may have a similar effect
upon him.” Let him declaim before a looking-glass,
and see for himself how awkward, unnatural and
strained is his delivery ; let him obtain the aid of
some intelligent and plain-spoken friend to criticise
him as he proceeds, "and he will soon find that a
rough, coarse, slovenly, or a stiff, stilted, unnatural
manner and action are not incurable evils. It may
be objected that all this is troublesome. Of course
it is, and, if the services of a competent instructor be
secured, expensive too; but the results will be well
worth paying for. The person previously so justly
dissatisfied with himself will begin to find his useful-
ness increase ; and if he dare not hope that he shall
find truths divine come mended from his tongue,'
at least he will find them come, not deformed or
disguised."
Preachers, however, fear to study Elocution, because
the result may be, and in the hands of certain
teachers seems to be, the acquiring an artificial
manner. They seem to think that it is better to be
ineffective than artificial. But this feeling, though
right and commendable, is founded on an entire
misconception of the purpose of studying the Art of
Elocution, the object of which is, shortly, to make the
speaker pay more attention both to the meaning of
what he is saying and to the manner in which that
meaning should be conveyed to others. The object
of the true teacher is, not to teach the pupil to feign

feelings, but to develop his powers of expression, and
make him better able to represent what he actually
feels. Such faults of manner as are to be observed in
almost every preacher ought to be eradicated, for in
what else, except public speaking, does a man ever
take credit for not attempting to do well what is the
chief business of his life ? And yet there are those
who boast of never having studied Elocution, as if
such neglect was meritorious, and as if those who
pursued a different course rendered themselves open
to the suspicion of insincerity and self-seeking.
The Rock, in noticing the above says :-“Mr.
Garry's paper on Pulpit Elocution contains some
sound advice, and some caustic criticism ; but do
ninety-nine out of every hundred clergymen, in
reading the Prayers, address the Deity as if they had
the stomach-ache?” This statement is not mine, but
that of a
man whose eloquence draws together
larger congregations than almost any Church of
England clergyman can point to.
I heard a clergyman recently, when reading the
Prayer for Parliament, emphasize the word "and ” in
the expression "peace and happiness, truth and
justice, religion and piety.” Another read his sermon
in a tone of stilted affectation. A third intoned the
Prayers in a manner which promised him a speedy
experience of “clergyman's sore throat." As has been
said, “ As it is much easier to intone the Service toler-
ably than to read it tolerably, many young clergymen
attempt to intone. The result frequently is a good deal

of harsh, dissonant sound, very annoying to those among
the congregation who are gifted with musical ears.”
&
“Mr. Rupert Garry, in a little volume just published
by him, tells us that he recently heard a clergyman,
in reading a Prayer for Parliament, emphasize the
conjunctions on each occasion in the expression,
'peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion and
piety.' It would, perhaps, be hard to say whether
this was a worse offence than that of the young lady
who, in playing 'Ophelia,' asked her brother not to
show her the steep and thorny way to heaven,' with
such special emphasis on the adjectives that, as some
one observes, it might be thought there was a secret
primrose path' leading in the same direction, which
'Laertes' was selfishly reserving for his own private
Perhaps the clergyman's misplaced emphasis
may have been 'meant sarcastic,' but was certainly
mischievous; for these are not times in which it is
advisable to suggest that in Parliament peace and
happiness are very different things. As to the implied
disassociation of truth and justice, religion and piety,'
everyone must judge for himself. Mr. Garry's com-
plaints of the tone of 'stilted affectation' in which
some preachers deliver sermons, and the painfully
unsuccessful efforts of others to intone, belong to a
different category.
They will awaken painful
reminiscences among the members of many afflicted

HINTS TO AMATEUR ACTORS.
WHEN it is almost impossible to open a local paper
without finding a notice of some amateur dramatic
performance, it may not be altogether a matter of
supererogation to offer a few remarks-and even to
give a little good advice-on the subject of Amateur
Acting One fault of amateurs is that they too
frequently select pieces, not on account of their
suitability to the company which intends to play
them, but because they have seen them represented
on the professional stage. Consequently, they try
merely to copy what they have seen, with the almost
inevitable result that they fail much more than if
they had studied, for themselves, the character allotted
to them, forming their own ideas upon it, and acting
upon those ideas. No doubt some might fail from an
inadequate, or even a wrong, conception of the
character, as is often the case among more experienced
professionals; but yet the acting would be less stiff
and unnatural than when it is simply the result of
imitation. If amateurs followed this plan, and worked
.
with zeal as well as intelligence, we should see, not
only much less staginess and awkwardness, but per-
haps even more freshness and originality in the
delineation of character. Aspirants, whether amateur
or professional, should endeavour to form their own
style. To become a servile copyist, a mere imitator

a
or mimic is to stifle the individuality which belongs to
each person, and which, when properly developed, alone
ensures excellence; but without elocutionary study
and a knowledge of declamation, none can arrive at
real excellence.
It was after writing this I came across the following
by Mr. Henry Irving, in a speech made at the close of
his. reading for the School of Expression in Boston.
He said : "Good acting is not declamation, but the
expression of character, and the actor's aim is not to
imitate this style or that, but to cultivate his own
resources of impersonation. It appears to me, while
not claiming to be an authority, that the danger in
teaching elocution is that some formal and artificial
method should supersede nature. But in this school
you seek to avoid that danger by the recognition of
the principle that all good speaking comes from the
training of the faculties of the mind."
In a leading literary paper I found the following :-
“Let the amateur actor select with what discrimina-
tion he may from among the plays known to the
public, but give the time and labour he now expends
on learning the tricks of some favourite model in the
profession to forming his own conception and a style
of his own.
He must not flatter himself that he will
be able to do this on the spur of the moment. He
will have to study acting instead of confining his
observations to one actor, and to do so with advantage
he must use all his intelligence and powers of dis-
crimination. But he will also find it much more

interesting, and when he has succeeded in making a
character his own, he will probably succeed in repre-
senting it with ease and fidelity.” The usual plan,
however, is for amateurs to place themselves in the
hands of a professional actor—so long as he is
“ professional” they do not seem to care whether he
is capable or incapable—by whom they are crammed
with his own notions on one particular play. The
result can be imagined, so that the outside public
scrupulously avoid amateur dramatic performances.
A small book recently published by George Bell
and Sons, containing a list of 100 plays, entitled,
What Shall we Act," by M. E. James, will prove an
excellent guide to the selection of suitable plays for
amateurs. In addition to those mentioned there, the

purpose :-A Morning Call, by Dance, I m. i f.;

(1) Have a good stage manager, who must be good-
tempered and firm, but not good-natured and obsti-
nate. Let him show that his will is law, and that
his arrangements must be carried out. If he does
not prove fit for the duties, if he is always altering
the arrangements of the previous day, he should at
once be superseded by some competent person.
Such changes are not only extremely irritating, but
are absolutely confusing to the actors, and detrimental
to the smooth performance of the play. Audiences
quickly spot defective stage management and want
of careful and intelligent rehearsals.
manager ought to be strong enough to restrain the
ill-regulated enthusiasm of those who, having but
small parts, want to obtrude themselves on the audi-
ence. To play a small part properly at first is the
only way to learn how to play bigger parts after-
wards. Modesty, patience, and perseverance should
be the motto of all actors N.B. The stage manager
should never take a part in the play. (2) Then get a
good prompter, whose duty it should be to attend
every rehearsal, for he ought to study every actor so
as to learn their peculiarities and their “business,"
also, when a pause is made, to know whether it is
intentional and done for effect, or is due to failure of
memory.
He should also have his copy carefully

and clearly marked with notes as to entrances, exits,
“ business," and above all he should have the actors
ready at the wings to go on at the exact instant. (3)
Let each performer learn his part by heart as quickly
and correctly as possible, so that the entire attention
may be given to the performance of the character,
otherwise the piece is foredoomed to failure. There
should be as many rehearsals as possible, the last two
to be dress rehearsals, when the play should be acted
exactly as it is to be before the audience. In the
case of amateurs, every effort should be made to have
the entire company present on each occasion. All
“ business" and by-play should be carefully explained
by each actor, otherwise confusion will be the result.
Above all, the performer should not be satisfied
with being merely what is called "letter-perfect." He
should study the character he is to represent carefully,
trying to become the character as closely as possible.
“No committing of the piece to memory will be of
service,” says Goethe, “if the actor has not, in the first
place, penetrated into the sense and spirit of the
author, the mere letter will avail nothing." He must
work up in his own mind the feelings which are
supposed to actuate him at each moment, and he
must never trust to the spur of the moment. A well-
known teacher of Elocution and Dramatic Art once
told me that he always trusted to the inspiration of
the moment, and many persons, for fear of becoming
mechanical, practically follow out his advice, with the
natural result. Mr. George Henry Lewes, a most
(

able dramatic critic, says :-"What is called inspira-
tion is the mere haphazard of carelessness or incom.
petence; the actor is seeking an expression which he
ought to have found when studying his part. What
would be thought of a singer who sang his aria
differently every night? In the management of his
breath, in the distribution of light and shade, in his
phrasing, the singer who knows how to sing never
varies. The timbre of his voice, the energy of his
spirits may vary ; but his methods are invariable.
Actors learn," or ought to learn, “their parts as
singers learn their songs. Every detail is deliberate,
or has been deliberated. The very separation of art
from nature involves this calculation. The sudden
flash of suggestion, which is called inspiration, may
be valuable, it may be worthless; the artistic element
estinates the value, and adopts or rejects it ac-
cordingly. Trusting to the inspiration of the moment
is like trusting to a shipwreck for your first lesson in
swimming."
Hazlitt, perhaps the ablest of dramatic critics,
says: "We think it a rule that an actor ought to
vary his part as little as possible, unless he is
convinced that his former mode of playing it is
He should make up his mind as to the
best mode of representing the part, and come as
near to this standard as he can in every successive
exhibition. It is absurd to object to this mechanical
uniformity as studied and artificial. All acting is
studied or artificial. An actor is no more called
erroneous.

upon to vary his gestures or articulation at every
new rehearsal of the character than an author can
be required' to furnish various readings to every
separate copy of his work. To a new audience it
is quite unnecessary; to those who have seen him
before in the same part it is worse than useless.
They may, at least, be presumed to have come to
a second representation, because they approved of
the first, and will be sure to be disappointed in
almost every alteration. The attempt is endless, and
can only produce perplexity and indecision in the
actor himself.”
Speaking of Monnet-Sully of the Comédie Française,
Mr. Brander Matthews says: "He can act merely as
he feels, and his feelings change from day to day. He
rarely plays the same parts twice alike, and this is a
sure sign of imperfect art; for when an actor has once
found the proper emphasis, the proper tone, and the
proper gesture for a phrase, he should always seek to
give the phrase just that emphasis, just that tone, and
accompany it by just that gesture. At one time he
may be able to do it more efficiently than at another,
but he should always try to do this." This is so self-
evident that I would not notice it at all, were it not
that some of our actors, and even some of our drama-
tic teachers, entertain an opposite view, with the result
that the acting on the English stage is unequal and
very often flabby.
There are two points to which I would wish to
draw particular attention, as they are always a sign

prejudice an audience, disposing it to be more
critical :
(1) The curtain shall be rung up promptly at the

should be as short as possible. A "wait" should
never be more than ten minutes, six or eight is best ;
and the orchestra should have strict orders to play
during the entire interval.

THE VOICE.
“All public speakers, as well as singers,” says Lennox Browne,
“should receive scientific training in the mechanism and right em-
ployment of the organ of voice. It is precisely here, on the threshold
of their art, that many elocutionists fail. They occupy themselves with
articulation, pronunciation, intonation, modulation, emphasis, and
gesture”—? gesticulation—"and having but little, if any, physio-
logical knowledge, are therefore unable to form a true basis of voice-
production. It is clear that a teacher of singing or of elocution who
is thoroughly and practically acquainted with the anatomy and physi-
ology of the parts, over which he is to give his pupils control is,
other qualifications being equal, in a position to produce better
results than one who is deficient in such skill."
“The knowledge of the Vocal Organs is always very useful to the
singer, and in many cases indispensable to the teacher.”—Tosi.
FOR a speaker or a singer to have a complete
scientific knowledge of the vocal organs would not
only be unnecessary but useless. But a simple
outline of their construction and connection with
each other is necessary, in order that the pupil
may understand the explanations which every
teacher ought to give when demonstrating how
the voice may be best produced and controlled.
The principal Vocal Organs are—(1) The Dia-
phragm and Midriff, (2) The Lungs, (3) The Bronchial
Tubes, (4) The Trachea, (5) The Vocal Cords, (6)
The Mouth.

each meal-or with a tight belt round the waist.
Tight lacing is very bad, as it interferes with the
free play of the lungs, and impairs the vocal powers.
Take plenty of physical exercise so as to keep in
good health.
Practise holding the breath after a deep inhalation
for several seconds before letting it go. This exercise
strengthens the lungs and gives control over the
breath.
(2) The Lungs may be said generally to depend
for their power on the quantity of breath they are
capable of receiving. They are just above the dia-
phragm, and consist of two conically-shaped bodies,
lying in the cavity of the chest, which are composed
of a vast multitude of little vessels, or hollow air
cells, into which the breath pours when the chest
is expanded, and from which it is expelled when the
chest is contracted,
· Exercise them, when standing upright, by inhaling
the largest possible draught of pure air—nothing will
compensate for an imperfect supply to the lungs of
pure atmospheric air. Let the breathing be deep and

THE LUNGS,

tranquil, but such as to cause the chest to rise fully
and fall freely, and at every effort fill the lowest cell
of the lungs. The expansion of the lungs depends
on the size and expansibility of the thorax, and
therefore, every effort should be made, by means
of suitable exercises, to make the chest capable of
expansion. The chief function of the lungs is the
removal of the carbonic acid from the blood, and the
introduction of oxygen.
For those with weak lungs, or who have any
impediment in their speaking, practise whispering,
in which the words are articulated simply by the
action of the mouth and fauces, no vocal tones being
produced. The practice must, however, not be too
frequent or too long-sustained, as it requires a greater
number of inspirations and an increased force in ex-
piration.
Weak voices may be strengthened by inhaling
deeply, then closing the glottis, and then directing
the air forcibly against and through it. Afterwards
vary the exercises by emitting sound. Begin on the
C and go upwards. Sound skah and kah, and hold
the note as long as possible. By practice, a note can
be held for more than twenty seconds. In practising
this exercise, take care that no breath comes out with
the sound, because otherwise not only is the stock of
breath exhausted, but the tone of the voice is spoiled.
To test this, speak or sing with a lighted candle
before the mouth. If there is breath, the candle will
Aicker ; if not, it will burn in the usual manner.

THE VOICE,
Practise sighing also, which consists of a rather
long inspiratory effort by the diaphragm and other
muscles concerned in inspiration, the air almost noise-
lessly passing in through the glottis and being rather
suddenly expelled again by the elastic recoil of the
lungs and chest walls, and probably also of the
abdominal walls. When the vocal cords are called
into action, the sigh is converted into a groan.
(3) The Bronchial Tubes are next above the lungs.
Taken together with the larynx, they constitute what
is called the Trachea, or windpipe, which resembles an
inverted tree. The bronchial tubes are the inverted
twigs and branches, the trachea is the trunk, and the
larynx is the upturned root. They are a number
of little air-pipes, whose lower extremities are inserted
in the upper surface of the lungs.
They perform two functions :-(1) That of air-
pipes; (2) That of resonant cavities. Hence the
larger and more capacious these organs, the greater
the depth, fulness, and volume of the vocal sounds.
They are liable to be obstructed by secretions from
colds and bronchial maladies, and should, therefore,
be exercised, gently and cautiously, in breathing large
draughts of pure air ; otherwise the voice becomes
impure from imperfect resonance.
(4) The Trachea, or Windpipe, is a tube consisting
of a series of elastic cartilaginous, or gristly rings. It
is supplied with muscular fibres, by which the tube is
capable of contraction or expansion, both in its length
and breadth. It divides into two smaller tubes the

right and left bronchus—which pass respectively into
the two lungs. Its upper extremity is furnished with
a number of cartilages, forming what is called the
Larynx. By propelling air through the larynx, vocal
sounds are produced.
(5) The Larynx and Vocal Cords are the organs for
generating the sound of the voice.
The Larynx is a cartilaginous box at the upper
part of the windpipe, the exterior projection of which
is popularly known as Adam's Apple, from the strange
idea, or legend, that a portion of the forbidden fruit
stuck in his throat at this spot, and has in appearance
been perpetuated in all his descendants. It is composed
of a framework of cartilages articulated together, and
connected by elastic ligaments. Behind the tongue
and in front of the upper opening of the larynx, is a
curved, upright, fibro-cartilaginous plate, called the
Epiglottis, which forms a kind of valve, or cover, to the
glottis, when the larynx is drawn upwards as in the
act of swallowing, thus preventing the entrance of
food or drink into the air passage, and sending the
matter into the gullet, or proper passage for food.
Persons sometimes, while in the act of swallowing,
attempt to speak. The doing so raises the epiglottis,
or lid; a particle of food gets in under it, to remove
which Nature instantly institutes a violent fit of
coughing; and then it is usual to remark that the
food went the wrong way.”
The Larynx is crossed about the middle of its
bell-like cavity by two elastic parallel bands of tissue
.

THE VOICE.
-vocal ligaments, or cords—which are capable of
being lengthened or shortened by the muscular action
of the organ. They project opposite to each other
from the sides of the inner wall of the larynx, and are
made to vibrate in unison by the breath as it is
expelled from the lungs; and by these vibrations the
breath is converted into sound. The force with which
the breath is expelled from the lungs causes the cords
to vibrate through a greater or less breadth, and,
according to the number of vibrations in a given time,
so the sound thereby produced is either higher or
lower in pitch. When the cords are shortened, or
relaxed, their vibrations are relatively few in number,
and the notes are consequently deep; when they are
elongated and tense, their vibrations are relatively
rapid, and the notes are consequently high.
Aphonia, or voicelessness, in which the person is
unable to speak, except in a whisper, is produced by
the inflammation and clogging of the vocal cords, so
that they cease to vibrate.
The space between, or that bounded by, the two
vocal cords is termed the Glottis, which is a narrow
chink forming the mouth of the larynx. The opening
and contraction of this portion of the vocal apparatus
decides, in part, the gravity or the shrillness of the
tone. While sounding the deepest notes, or inhaling
a deep breath, the larynx is drawn down, and the
glottis is open, forming an elliptical slip; when
uttering a high note the glottis is nearly closed at the
top. “ The comparative width of the glottis-that is,

THE GLOTTIS.
79
One cause,
the distance from each other of the vocal cords-does
not affect the pitch of the voice; the pitch of the cords
is the result of their tension alone; and so long as
this tension is preserved, or remains unmodified, so
long will the pitch remain the same, however wide or
narrow the glottis may be. There is, however, a
marked difference in the degree of force required to
make the same note; the power needful increasing
according to the extent of the separation of the cords
from each other, and vice versa.
then, of the difference in the range of voice between one
person and another consists—other things being
equal—in the greater power possessed by one person
over another in making more tense his or her vocal
cords ; for the tighter these are strung, the higher is
the resulting note. But as in different persons there
are differences in the length and in the thickness of the
vocal cords, just as there are differences in the length
of people's limbs, so are there differences in the
amount or degree of force required by different
individuals to produce the same note ; and even
though the same absolute degree of contractile force
be in operation in all the cases. In other words, the
longer the cords, the greater the tension required to
evolve any particular note; and the thicker the cords
the greater the force required to produce any particular
note.
Another factor in the difference of
vocal power of different persons, consists in the
difference of resonance of their respective vocal cords ;
and of the cartilages and adjacent structures of the

larynx. Where these structures are lax and puffy,
and devoid of proper tone, we cannot expect to find,
nor do we find, that purity, sweetness and strength of
the vocal powers which are met with in those whose
vocal organs, and all in connection with those organs,
are finely strung and possessed of superior tonicity.
For it is this healthful tonicity which confers upon the
tissues, not only the property of responding to the
calls made upon them, but of responding with due
alacrity; and which also confers upon them their
delicate elastic properties.
"In women—and in boys, before the age of puberty
—the length of the vocal cords, as compared with
men, is as 2 to 3. But in boys at the age of puberty,
the larynx begins to increase rapidly in size, like the
rest of his organization; and the vocal cords,
partaking of this increase, finally attain their maxi-
mum length as the boy develops into full man-
hood. And this lengthening of the cords produces
a difference in the character of the voice ; this
becoming changed into one of a deeper or lower
pitch, corresponding to the addition made to the
length of the cords, and to their increased thickness.
A remarkable property possessed by the larynx is its
power of preserving the same pitch, or sounding the
same note, however forcibly or loudly that note may
be sounded—the loudness of the note being limited
only by the power possessed by the vocalist of
expelling air through the larynx from his lungs.
He
may begin in pianissimo, and with a note so soft as

scarcely to be audible, and end in fortissimo, in a tone
so loud that the very room appears to partake of the
vibration of his chest-walls; and yet the note sounded
shall be of the same pitch throughout. In a wind
instrument of man's invention, this power of increasing
the loudness of the note is confined within compara-
tively narrow limits. In the latter, when the air
passing through the pipe attains a certain velocity in
sounding any particular note, any further attempts to
increase the intensity of the note, by a still more
vigorous blow or stream of air, proves at once
abortive, by the note jumping an octave higher. In
the larynx, however, provision is made whereby the
note or tone originally beginning in pianissimo, may
be rendered louder and louder, and still preserve its
pitch, however forcibly the air may be passed through
the larynx from the lungs—a result unattainable by
any artificial contrivance. And though the exact
mechanism, by which this admirable property or
power of adjustment is accomplished by the larynx,
is not fully known or made clear, we may safely infer
that it can be achieved only by the simultaneous and
proportionate relaxation of the vocal cords, by the
action of the thyro-arytenoid muscle; the delicacy of
which adjustment is so fine that the mind cannot
grasp it.” It is a good thing to practise uttering the
hard sounds, b, d, g, k, as this exercise enlarges the
larynx, and thus increases the volume and quality of
the voice.

resonance and differentiations of the volume of sound.
The entire resonant apparatus consists of the
pharynx, the mouth, and the double set of passages
of the nose.
The pharynx, situated immediately above the
larynx, forming the open space at the back of the
mouth, although not directly concerned in the pro-
duction of sound, has a great effect upon the character
and quality of the voice. The larger this cavity, the
better the resonance of the voice and, generally, the
deeper the tone. To give the voice the full effect of
round, smooth and agreeable tone, the free use of the
cavity of the mouth is indispensable ; the whole
mouth must be thrown open by the unimpeded action
and movement of the lower jaw. A free and liberal
opening of the mouth is the only condition on which
a free and effective utterance can be produced. The
non-observance of this, resulting in the straining of
the vocal cords, is injurious to all voices, and has
An able physician writes :—“The
position of the mouth necessary for sounding oh or
au', which are called round or clear tones, is that most
favourable to the production of vocal sound; while
the injurious method usually adopted by singing ah,
not only induces an unpleasing quality of tone, but
establishes a braced or tightened condition of the
organ, highly detrimental to their proper and healthy
action.” Some teachers insist on the straining of the
vocal ligaments for increasing the power of the voice,
instead of allowing the larynx to fulfil its natural
ruined many.

function of ascending into the pharynx for producing
high notes, and descending when producing low or
grave notes.
When the vocal cords are stretched
too much, the notes are certain to become harsh and
disagreeable.
The orotund quality of voice is produced by the
wide and free opening of the mouth, especially the
pharynx, and requires full and deep inspiration and
expiration of the breath, in order to assist in opening
all the resonant chambers of the chest, throat and
head. Purity of sound is also one of its constituent
elements. The audible utterance of masculine force,
courage, energy, admiration, grandeur and power, in
fact, all deep, powerful and sublime emotions, depend
for expression on this quality.
Though the chest portion of the register is the
proper one to use, never use the very lowest portion.
Speak in your natural key. When the chest is felt to
vibrate under the impact of the sound-waves, we are
using the voice in the most efficient and agreeable
manner. Never speak too loud, the effort being
injurious to the speaker and disagreeable to the
listener. If the respiration and the key-note are well
inanaged, the voice will reach the farthest limits of
the largest hall without an effort. Speak slowly, with
well balanced pauses, so as to allow the sound waves
to subside, otherwise the result is a confusion and
jumble of sounds. Be very particular in sounding
the vowels carefully and well.

Never strain the voice either by speaking too long
or in too high a key, or when fatigued, unwell, or
suffering from a cold. At the first sign of hoarseness,
cease speaking, or use the voice as little as possible,
and in as low a tone as possible.
Clergyman's sore throat, or follicular pharyngitis,
consists principally of dryness of the mucous niem-
brane of the pharynx and a peculiar huskiness of the
voice, and is produced nearly always by a wrong use
of the organs of speech. The breath is forced too
much, and the voice is used in an unnatural and
affected manner. Undue stress is laid on the larynx
and the vocal cords, which ultimately yield to the
tension.
In an excellent work on Medicine, I met with the
following :-“ Clergymen and Lecturers often get into
the habit of speaking in a voice which is not natural
to them. They use an assumed tone of voice, in
many cases probably unconsciously imitating some
one whose delivery they admire. Undue stress is
laid on the larynx and vocal cords, which ultimately
yield to tension. The best way is to ask the opinion
on the point, and take the advice, of a Teacher of
Elocution,” whose ears should be sufficiently acute
and trained to recognise whether the voice of the
speaker is being used naturally or not.

What may suit one person may not suit another, and
may not even be equally suitable at all times. Pro-
vided it is not injurious in itself, speakers or singers
should be allowed to take whatever they find, from
experience, to be good for them. Anything that
keeps the mouth moist and acts as a lubricant to the
throat is most generally useful.
Eggs, raw or beaten up with sherry, are about as
good as anything.
Do not load the stomach before speaking, as this
often interferes with the free use of the voice ; nor, on
the contrary, must one speak on an empty stomach,
the mere presence of food in the stomach imparting a
great impulse to the vital functions. When there is a
tendency to dyspepsia, one or two Pepsine Tabloids,
after eating, will help to insure the correct operation
of the stomach.
Never sip cold water while speaking.
Avoid acids and astringents, because, although they
clear the voice at first, their tendency is, in time,
to harden the more delicate fibres of the throat.
Oranges, apples, stone fruit are all injurious to the
voice unless cooked. Especially avoid nuts. Too
much sugar and fat is apt to encourage flatulent
dyspepsia, and consequent impairment of respiration
and vocalisation; therefore, avoid heavy puddings,
fat meat, melted butter-sauces, etc.
Among the exciting causes of diseases of the throat
and the nasal passages are the indulgence of cold
drinks immediately after eating food, and the im-

moderate use of iced drinks in summer, especially
when the body is exhausted.
In going out from a warm room to a chilly outside
air, avoid speaking as much as possible, or if you
must do so, take the precaution of holding a handker-
chief over the mouth.
In connection with this, I would also impress upon
all speakers, vocalists, reciters, etc., the extreme
necessity of paying attention to their teeth, not only
for the sake of appearance, and because keeping them
clean preserves them longer, but also because clean
teeth help in producing clear tones. The teeth, more.
over, act as a kind of respirator to the mouth, while
the want of them detracts from that clearness of
articulation which is so necessary.
Cleaning the
teeth thoroughly the first thing in the morning with a
brush of soft badger's hair and lukewarm water, along
with any of the following dentifrices, will in a short
time produce a great improvement even in the most
discoloured teeth. I myself have found nothing
better than camphorated chalk, with a little orris-root
or a little myrrh in it. I can also recommend the
Odontobaph Tooth Powder and Tooth Paste, while
rinsing the mouth out the last thing at night with a
little of the Odontobaph Mouth Wash in a wineglass
of water will prove additionally useful, as also in
strengthening the gums.

iron, which act as tonics to the system generally. A
very good lubricating drink is made thus :Take
equal parts of tragacanth, pure starch and good
sugar. When properly dissolved, a teaspoonful may
be added to a glass of water, and taken in small
quantities, so as not to overcharge the stomach. This
forms a pleasant liquid of such consistency and
adhesive power as covers and protects for a short
time the membranous lining of the throat.
Hot peppers, pickles, curries, cayenne lozenges,
are injurious to the voice. Lemon juice, with soda
water, is both wholesome and palatable.
On the first appearance of hoarseness bathe the
feet in hot water, drink something hot, and then get
into bed between blankets. In fact, I would recom-
mend all, especially those who have a tendency to
rheumatism, to sleep always without sheets. I have
done so for years, and have found the benefit of it.
One advantage of it is that you get rid of the
possibility of “damp sheets,” which are the cause of
so many colds.
In his interesting work on Musical Education, Mr.
Alberto Bach says “ In the first hours after an
appearance of cold in the head, let a little bottle with
a wide neck, and containing a few grains of iodine or
of hartshorn, be put to the nose every four or five
minutes. Of great service, also, is the inhalation,
through the nostrils, of the steam of hot water.

patient. If the larynx is affected with cold one must
not sing at all; the best remedy is rest and the
inhalation of warm vapours. Inclination to coughing
must be resisted, and in the same way one must
abstain from clearing the throat on slight irritation.
Vocalists who have contracted this habit of clearing
their throats, should request as a favour to have
their attention drawn to it when they are observed
to indulge in it; for they often unconsciously
mar their performances by short coughs. A ten-
dency to coughing must, therefore, be suppressed.
Stewed plums and warm milk, with a little sugar
in it, will allay the irritation.
Caustic
and tannin are to be used only under advice
for the prevention of threatening diseases. They
make the membranes rigid, deprive them of their
elasticity, and interfere with the voice. When swal-
lowing becomes painful, or is impeded, a towel dipped
in cold water, and well wrung out, may be applied
round the throat both day and night. .
In some
serious cases the advice of an able physician should
be sought without delay.”
Warm cravats and all muffling about the throat
are relaxing. If afraid of cold protect the part just
behind and beneath the ears.
If the throat is very dry after singing or reciting, a
gargle of arnicated water will greatly refresh the
throat ; while just rinsing out the mouth with this
water will remove the sense of thirst; or glycerine
jujubes medicated with arnica are good.

The following remedies I can recommend from
personal experience.
Hazeline exerts a wonderfully tonic action on
mucous membranes, and, as Dr. Ringer, Prof. Cli-
nical Medicine, University College Hospital, says, “is
useful in catarrh of the mucous membrane, and snuffed
up through the nose is beneficial in cold in the head,
and in hay fever." It is quite innocuous, and
occasions no unpleasant results, so that it can be
used with great freedom in inflamed and relaxed
states of the throat, for it is both astringent and
antiseptic. In catarrhal or inflammatory conditions
of the throat, it may be used as a gargle ; but where
the trouble is with the larynx or bronchi, it should be
employed in a spray-producer. In hæmorrhage from
any part of the respiratory tract, Hazeline should be
taken in a little water, in 30 drop doses, frequently
repeated.
Chloride of Ammonium takes the foremost place
with many actors, public speakers, and singers for
aphonia, irritation and weakness of the vocal cords.
Its usefulness in catarrhal conditions of the throat and
lungs is attested by laryngologists generally.

mucous. Therapeutists hold that there is no drug
which will so effectually remove catarrhal deposits
from the meshes of mucous membranes. For throat
troubles a Chloride of Ammonium Tabloid should be
dissolved slowly on the middle of the tongue, not near
the tip which is too sensitive. These Tabloids are
strongly recommended for bronchitis. Where there
is irritation, huskiness, hacking, or an uncontrollable
tendency to cough, I can recommend the Tabloids of
Chlorate of Potash and Borax. Chlorate of Potash is
an old-time remedy, and a good one for affections of
the mouth and pharynx, while Borax is much
esteemed for clergyman's sore throat, aphonia from
over-use of the voice, and even such diseases as
diphtheria.
In case of extreme irritation, or of pain, recourse
should be had to the Voice Tabloids of Cocaine,
Chlorate of Potash and Borax. They will even relieve
the painful swallowing sometimes encountered in
consumption of the larynx, and may, indeed, be
employed for pain in the throat from any cause.
Cocaine is generally valued by throat specialists, and
clearer, fuller, richer tones seem to follow upon the
use of these Voice Tabloids.
A remedy which has attained great popularity
in chronic bronchial affections is Pure Terebene
(B. W. & Co.). It was with this medicine that Dr.
Murrell, F.R.C.P., Assist. Phys. and Lect. on
Materia Medica, Westminster Hospital, succeeded
in curing consecutively 120 cases of winter cough.

It is a powerful expectorant, and may be inhaled
from a spray atomizer, or taken internally in doses
of 5 or 10 drops on a lump of sugar. Care should
be taken to obtain the pure product, as impure
terebene causes severe irritation.
Eucalyptine is a remedy which would, doubtless, be
used more than it is, were it not so difficult to obtain
it pure. By smelling constantly some cloth or cotton,
on which it has been dropped, the drug will prove most
serviceable in cold in the head and nasal catarrh.
Even where there is a profuse, offensive, semi-purulent
a
discharge, it removes fetor and checks the secretion.
The drug may be very advantageously used for
further medicating the fumes of the Chloride of
Ammonium Inhaler, which is done by pouring a few
drops of it into the “ water bottle.” Again, the thera-
peutic value of the exhalations of pine trees has long
been known. Scientists have discovered that the
most efficacious medicinal products are obtained from
the pinus Pumilio, which grows amid the Alpine
Pinol is a volatile oil distilled from it, and is
distinguished from common pine oils by its exquisite
fragrance and non-irritating properties. The drug is
largely used on the Continent in affections of the
respiratory tract, including nasal catarrh, pharyngitis,
quinsy, clergyman's sore throat, aphonia, asthma,
pertussis, chronic bronchitis, bronchorroea and phthisis.
It is also employed externally for pleuritic and inter-
costal pains. It is frequently prescribed in inhalations

snows.

3 minim doses on a lump of sugar.
The fumes of Chloride of Ammonium act as
most effectual tonic to the mucous membrane in
throat-cough, pharyngeal irritation, and relaxation
and weakness of the vocal apparatus. “The vapour
of the Chloride of Ammonium,” says one writer,
"removes unhealthy and offensive secretions, and
restores the diseased or weakened vocal and respira-
tory mucous membrane to a healthy state, so that,
in the case of catarrh, where thickening, induration,
and irritation exist, a most decided improvement is
brought about in a short time.” Authorities generally
recommend the Vereker Chloride of Ammonium
Inhaler as the best. It generates neutral fumes, and
is always ready for use. The remotest parts of the
respiratory mucous tract may be reached by these
fumes, which are absolutely harmless if neutral.
Pastilles de Bonnet and Pastilles d'Agents de Change,
as containing liquorice, gums, etc., are also excellent
lubricants for the throat.
Coca, a plant of South America, has a wonderful
effect in removing all sense of fatigue, while its use

GESTURE.
GESTURE.
I NOW come to an element in good speaking which
is the most difficult of all, because it cannot be
properly explained, except viva voce— I mean Gesture,
not Gesticulation. Gesture is a science; Gesticulation
is merely unmeaning guesswork. Gestures have a
meaning, gesticulation has none. Few, however, know
the difference. Gesture is a subject which requires to
be studied; it cannot be picked up. Vandenhoff
truly says :—“ It is next to impossible to teach
-
gestures by written instructions. Practical lessons,
under a good and experienced teacher, will do more
towards giving the pupil ease, grace, and force of
action, than all the books and plates in the world.”
Gesture has been aptly called the Language of
Nature, to distinguish it from the arbitrary and
more limited language of speech. Cicero, in one of
his Orations, has recommended particular attention to
delivery. “Action is, as it were, a kind of eloquence
of the body, as it consists both of the voice and of the
gesture. It is not without reason that Demosthenes
assigned to action the first, the second, and the third
place. For, if eloquence cannot subsist without action,
and if without eloquence action has such influence,
certainly its importance is very great to a public
speaker.” “The gesture of the public speaker," says
Austin, "must vary considerably with the different

circumstances of his situation, and with the nature of
the ideas he wishes to convey."
Cicero says :
* Every passion of the heart has its own appropriate
look, tone and gesture; and a man's own counten-
ance, his whole body and all the voices of his mouth
re-echo like the strings of a harp to the touch of
every emotion of his soul.”
" It would be needless to mention or portray all the
infinite varieties and shades of expression that may
be conveyed by the motions and attitudes of the
body, .. Such natural gestures as the following
need only to be mentioned to strike the intelligence
at once :-To clutch the hair indicates desperation;
to touch the forehead, reflection ; to touch the nose,
intelligence or cunning; to touch the chin, delibera-
tion; to strike the breast, daring; to slap the thigh,
impatience; to shake the finger or fist, menace, anger,
etc. But the great mirror of expression is the face.
There, in everchanging shades, thought, feeling, passion,
are portrayed with a power beyond the reach of
language ; wrath storms in the corrugated brow, and
flashes lightning from the eye; love and tenderness
thrill in the melting glance; suppressed passion
labours in the expanded nostrils ; scorn and disdain
ride on the curled lip. But what except the pencil
of the painter can do justice in describing these
things?
As M. Champeau wrote in the Dramatic Reciter
and Speaker of February, 1886:-"The eyes, says
Quintilian, are the chief feature in the face.
It is by

.
them that the soul is manifested, for when we are
glad they are lively and bright, and when sad they
are heavy. Buffon also says that it is in the eyes
that the internal emotions are expressed. The eye is
more closely connected with the soul than any other
organ: it seems to participate in all its movements,
and expresses the most lively passions and the most
agitated emotions, as well as the most gentle and
delicate sentiments. In the eye we look for meaning,
for human sentiment, for reproof. In fact, if there is
anything certain, it is that the mind is more promptly
and forcibly expressed by the eyes than by anything
else. We know this so well that, when questioning
.
anyone, we instinctively look to the eyes for the
answer before it has been uttered by the mouth. .
Words cannot be compared with the eloquence of the
eyes. As Cicero says, “The power of the eyes, the
manner of giving them expression, deserve the
greatest possible attention.""
The mouth is, next to the eyes, the most important
part of the countenance, as having the most expression.
"How few mouths, which have been beautiful in youth
(the season of happiness and smiles), are preserved
beyond that period. Every bad habit defaces the soft
beauty of the mouth, and leaves indelible on it the traces
of their injury.
That moral habits are capable
of altering the fine expressions of the countenance
can hardly be doubted. The character of the entire
countenance is under the dominion of those habits.
And beauty is often (and perhaps better) attributed

to the mind and dispositions beaming through the
countenance, than to symmetry of features and fine
colouring. The most beautiful face soon ceases to
please, if unworthy passions habitually deform its
expression.”
All gestures must be in curves, never in straight
lines. Do not, therefore, nove the arm and hand to
the intended position by the shortest line, but by a
curved one ; let the motion be rather slow until the
final position is almost reached, then let the hand
move more quickly to its place with more or less of
emphasis, according to the occasion, on the emphatic
word. As a rule the gesture is performed with the
right arm, the left arm merely supporting it. Of
course, there are exceptions, such as when the left
hand is spoken of in contradistinction to the right,
“For half of their fleet to the right and half to the
left were seen”-it not being permissible to point
across the body; when there is local allusion to some
object on the left of the speaker; when two
things are contrasted, if the case requires that the one
should be marked by the action of the right hand, it
is often as well to mark the antithetic word with the
left hand. When one hand is clenched the other
must not hang languid by the side, but must indicate,
in a secondary degree, the same feeling.
Quintilian seems to regard the hands as nearly
equal in power of expression to the countenance
itself. “Without the hands," he says, "delivery
would be maimed and feeble ; for, in copiousness

of expression, they almost equal words. The
action of the other parts of the body assist the
speaker, but the hands (I could almost say) speak
themselves. For with them do we not demand,
promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, detest,
fear, interrogate, deny ? With them do we not express
joy, sorrow, doubt, confession, penitence, moderation,
abundance, number, time?” The celebrated physician,
Cous, called the practice of the gestures of the hand
the most excellent lesson in eloquence. "Among
the wise men of Egypt, the inventors of the sacred
hieroglyphics, their designation of language was by
the symbol of a hand placed under a tongue. Every-
thing, it must be confessed, depends on the hand; it
gives strength and colouring to eloquence, and adds
force and nerves to the riches of thought.” How absurd,
then, was the habit, almost universally practised, of
wearing gloves, until inveighed against repeatedly by
me in the Dramatic Reciter and Speaker.
The beauty and force of all gesture consists in the
timely, judicious and natural employment of it, when
it can serve to illustrate the meaning, or give emphasis
to the force of any passage. Graceful, appropriate
and definite gestures render vocal delivery not only
more pleasing and effective, but carry greater con-
viction to the mind. Variety, however, is indispens-
able. The repetition of the same gesture, however
graceful it may be in itself, shows a poverty of
resource which is decidedly against the speaker.
The usual fault of speakers is either too much or

too little gesture. Many speakers indulge in no
gesture at all, from a natural feeling of awkwardness,
or from fear of being thought, what they call,
theatrical. Others again, to avoid the appearance
of
inanimateness, indulge in incessant movings of the
arms, with a bland indifference as to whether their
action is awkward, irrelevant, or unmeaning.
Correct and graceful gesture may be defined to
be a just and elegant adaptation of every part of
the body to the nature and import of the subject.
“Yet, though all confess the influence, power and
necessity of action," says the Rev. James Aber-
"
crombie, D.D., an eminent American writer on the
arts of reading and public speaking, “there are but
few public speakers who venture to use it ; and of
those few, a very large majority, through want of native
taste and judgment, or rather through want of early
and correct instruction, disgust, instead of pleasing,
by their awkwardness and absurdity. The study of
action in speaking consists chiefly in guarding against
awkward and disagreeable motions, and in learning
to perform such as are natural to the speaker, in
the most becoming manner, or such as are most
graceful and impressive. You may, therefore, with
unquestionable advantage, have recourse to such
masters as have carefully studied and are qualified
to teach them."
G. H. Lewes writes : "All but very great actors
are redundant in gesticulation ; not simply overdoing
the significant, but unable to repress insignificant

movements. If actors would study fine models,
they would learn that gestures to be effective must
be significant, and to be significant they must be
To stand still on the stage, and not appear
'a guy' is one of the elementary difficulties of the
art, and one which is rarely mastered." This applies
also to every kind of speaker.
To emphasize all parts alike is equivalent to no
emphasis at all; and by employing gestures on
unimportant passages, the speaker lessens his power
of rendering other parts effective. Gestures should
be reserved for such passages as require to be more
prominent, and for the most earnest feelings and the
boldest thoughts. The great aim should be to realise
and bring, as far as possible, before the mind's eye
the scene of the incident which he is describing.
As Quintilian says, “A speaker ought to suit his
gesture to the general sentiment which he expresses,
and not to the particular signification of the word
which he pronounces.”
The words and gestures should accompany each
other. As Shakespeare says: Action and utterance
go together." The motion which calls forth the word,
prompts, at the saine moment, the gesture ; but if the
speaker be warmed or excited, some difference of
time, however small, will take place between the
gesture and the words, the order in such cases being
the eyes; the countenance; the gestures; the words.
The eyes must always be directed as the gesture
points, except when we have to express aversion or

IOI
refusal, when we should, at the same time, show aver-
sion in our countenance, and reject by our gesture.
Impulsive jerks and unmeaning or indefinite move-
ments of the head, hands and arms, should be carefully
avoided. The speaker should learn to stand still.
Repose is a chief element of effect. Graceful inaction
is of immense importance to an actor or a speaker
The unmeaning wavings of the arms so commonly
indulged in, so far from adding to the force or the
beauty of a passage, greatly detract from it. As
Addison says: “We (the English) ought either to lay
aside all kinds of gestures, or at least make use of such
only as are graceful and expressive."
Propriety of gesture should be founded on some
natural connection between the sentiment and the
action. Remember the words which Shakespeare puts
into the mouth of Hamlet :-“Let your discretion be
your tutor, suit the action to the word, the word to
the action, with this special observance, that you over-
step not the modesty of nature." Do not follow the
example of a reciter who, when speaking of a boat
out at sea, pointed to the ceiling; or of a London
clergyman who, when uttering the words “we shall
approach the table of the Lord,” stood with his back
to the altar, and held his hand out behind him, palm
outwards.
The movements of the head should also be suited
to the character of the delivery. It should slightly
imitate the hands in every motion; but should not
be shaken or nodded frequently, a failing so con-

spicuous in many ambitious public speakers. The
head, by its movements, is very expressive ; it gives
assent by nodding; drawn back, it refuses assent;
is shaken in doubt, and still more in disapprobation ;
is turned away in dislike, aversion or horror; leans
forward in attention ; is held up in courage or pride ;
hangs down in shame; and falls on either hand or
on both hands in grief. A gesture of the head
alone, unaccompanied by any other gesture, is bad,
except in comic or humorous pieces.
The shoulders should move slightly in unison with
the movements of the trunk. They should not be
shrugged to express indifference or contempt, except
where imitation or mimicry is allowable.
The arms should always begin their movements
from the shoulders, not from the elbow, which must
neither be pinned closely to the side nor projected
awkwardly from it. An easy and free use of the
arms, and especially a pliancy of the wrist, should
be acquired. Goldsmith speaking of a celebrated
actress of his time says that she did not flourish
her hands while the upper part of her arms
motionless, nor had she the “ridiculous appearance
as if her elbows were pinned to her hips.” To do
so is not only ridiculous but positively ungraceful,
and yet any one attending any Recital or Dramatic
performance will too often see this sort of thing.
The unfolding of the arms is the first necessity in
acquiring graceful gesture, and when this is acquired
all other gestures are comparatively easy, though, of

course, their appropriateness depends on the intelli-
gence of the speaker, and on the care and thought he
has bestowed on the piece he is reciting, or the address
he is delivering
The hands, always ungloved, should be open, mus-
cles slightly relaxed ; the thumb not too much raised,
the two middle fingers joined and slightly separated
from the index and little finger. The palm of the
extended hand held downwards is expressive of sooth-
ing, calming, or of rest after labour.
“ He lay like a warrior, taking his rest.”
The palm of the extended hand held outwards to-
wards an object, is expressive of dislike or rejection ;
when strong excitement or deep feeling is to be ex-
pressed, the head is also to be averted.
“No more! I'll hear no more ! Begóne and leave me.
The joining of the hands at the tips, with the eye
uplifted, is expressive of deep thought and contempla-
tion. The hands are clenched in passion or resolve.
The wringing of the hands expresses grief or remorse,
and is generally accompanied by a restlessness of the
entire body.
The forefinger, when directed straight forward, is
very effective when some person or thing is to be
pointed out; also in exhibiting some precise point in
an argument; otherwise it should be seldom used.
The forefinger of the right hand laid on that of the
left, is expressive of nice discrimination, or minute
distinction. “ Mark me !-here is the point." The

hand laid on the region of the heart expresses sensa-
tion, emotion, love; on the breast, courage, appeal to
conscience or courage. If merely the points of the
fingers touch the breast, the motion is expressive of
self.
“ And keep his only són, niysélf, at home.”
The hand laid on the lips commands silence, or
denotes musing, thought. The hand, or forefinger,
touching the forehead, or traversing the regions of the
temples, with eyes uplifted, accompanied by a due
solemnity of utterance, indicates doubt, apprehension,
or anxiety.
The raising of both hands, with the arms extended
or curved, should seldom be used except where the
idea demands it ; and when used, both hands should
be raised and lowered at the same moment.

heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it
profanely) that, neither having the accent of Christian, nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, or man, have so strutted and
bellowed, that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen
had made mén, and not made them well—they imitated
humanity so abominably.
[The following apt commentary on “Hamlet's Advice to

the Players" is from the pen of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald :-

“ The Prince's instructions in the art of acting are more
in the direction of how not to do it; but from this can
be deduced the way how to do it. They concern various
matters; but the only two which concern us are Elocution
and Gesture. Speak the speech, trippingly on the tongue.
The meaning of this is shown by the caution against
the abuse that follows. The delivery is to be animated
and rather declamatory, but not to run into boisterous
mouthing.' On the other hand, an equally great mis-
take is to suppose that the colloquial style of drawing-rooms
and the streets are to be transported to the stage. All
the conditions of the stage are founded on exaggeration and
a certain over-emphasis. The conventional good morning'
and ' a fine day' tones are without effect. Even the strong
glare cast upon the performers makes every movement and
every glance of importance. And thus it is -- the time
being so short, and the attention being bestowed but for a
very short time— trivial tones and trivial speeches sound
hors de propus, and are out of keeping: * Trippingly,'
however-an admirable word—is what can barely be applied
to the style of delivery of existing actors, which in many
instances is slovenly and indistinct to a degree. 'Mouth it'
unhappily needs no description, and is familiar enough
in the provinces. Still, if we come to preference, it is
almost more to be endured than the other vice ; for it is an
excess of a good thing. It is evident, indeed, from the
whole of the Prince's instructions, that this sort of rant was
the abuse of his time, as indeed, it would seem to be of the
stage generally in all times and places. Only on our own

boards, singularly to say, we have shrunk into a sort of
a lethargic nonchalance. Some of this must be set down to
the taste for familiar comedy introduced by Mr. Robertson;
but the real cause lies deeper—to the want of instruction
and lack of experience in our performers. Many of the
younger London actors and actresses have had no training
at all, and some could be named who, with no gifts but their
good looks, good address and dress too), and good will,
have obtained leading positions. Use all gently. A golden
rule indeed. Reserved force is the secret of power. The
Prince lays this down in reference to gesture, Do not saw the
air too much, etc. It is extraordinary how, on the English
stage, tradition seems to admit but two modes of expression
-vehemence of voice, and vehemence of gesture; the ex-
traordinary effects which can be produced by the face being
overlooked. Of course Mr. Vaux-Clamant may retort :
"What, no expression in the elevation of my bushy eyebrows
- in this haughty scowl--this scornful curling of the lips.
Go to!' These are but elementary. Our protagonist has
but little notion of what is alluded to. How few understand
such finesse as this: the sudi!en shiftings or contention of
emotion ; the distrust or uneasiness conveyed without
frowning, or arching the brows, or other gymnastics-allow-
ing the sentiment to be read in the face before the utterance.
Again, the expression by carriage, air, manner. Suit the
action to the word, the word to the action. To find the
proper action for the word, nay, to forbéar action wholly
where action might be looked for; and how refreshing, how
welcome, how infinitely more significant than a page of
speaking is a truly significant action ! But this, again,
is only formed by the nicest observation of human characters,
and perhaps in a moment of inspiration.”]

follies cease with their youth, and not of that number, who

of detérmining ; but surely âge may become justly contémpti-

insult. Much worse is hé to be abhórred, who, as he has

more wicked with less temptation ; who prostitutes himself for
money which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his

crime;
I am accused of acting a theatrical part. A theatri-
cal part may either imply some peculiarity of gésture, or a
dissimulation of my real sentiments, or the adoption of the
opinions and language of another man. In the first sense,
the charge is too trifling to be confúted; and deserves only
to be méntioned that it may be despised. I am at liberty,
like every other man, to use my own language ; and though,
perhaps, I may have some ambition to please this gentleman,

THE SEMINOLE'S DEFIANCE.
By LIEUT.-Col. GEORGE W. PATTEN, U.S.A.
(Defant.) Blaze, with your serried columns ! I will not
bend the knée ;
The shackle ne'er again shall bènd the arm
which now is free!
I've mailed it with the thunder, when the tempest
muttered low;
And where it falls, ye well may dread the light-
ning of its blow.
(Scorn.) I've scared you in the city; I've scalped you on
the plain ;-
Go, count your chosen where they fell beneath
my leaden rain !
I scorn your proffered tréaty—the pale-face I
defy—
(Intensity.) Revenge is stamped upon my spear, and "blood”
my battle-cry !=
Some strike for hope of booty; some to defend
their all ;-
(Exulting.) I battle for the joy I have to see the white man
fall.

“ THE SON OF PERDITION.”
By G. BLATCH.

result of his meritations, a dark cloud appears before him, which slowly
unfolds and discovers a majestic figure of great personal beauty, but
bearing on its features the impress of the deadliest passions.]

Father ! sustain4 an untried soldier's soul.
Or life, or dedth,—whatever be the goal

One deēper prāyer, 'twas—that no cloud might lower

The cloud that pours the thunder from its womb,
But show the sterner grandeur of Thy fòrm;
The lightnings, glancing through the midnight gloom
To Faith's raised eye as calm, as lovely, come,
As splendours of the autumnal evening stár,
As roses shaken by the breezes plume,
When-like cool incense—comes the dewy air,
And, on the golden wave? the sunset búrns afàr.
God! Thou art mighty !=At Thy footstool bound,
Lie gazing to Thee, Chánce and Life and Death;
Nor in the Angel circle flaming round, -
Nor in the million worlds that blaze beneath,
Is ones that can withstand Thy wrath's hot breath.=
Woe—in Thy frówn ! in Thy smile—victory !

Let but these eyes my rescued country see, -

[Two haughty factions in Rome were rivals of each other, and, in the
feuds between them, Rienzi, a man of very humble birth but of good
education and aspiring mind, saw a chance of deliverance for Rome.
An insult having been offered to one of the citizens, he harangues the
people on their many and bitter wrongs, and contrasts their ancient
glory with their present degeneracy. The oppressors are put down, and
Rienzi is then elected Tribune.]

A copy of the Magazine, containing the above, was sent to M.
Legouvé, Membre de l'Académie Française, and one of the Council of
the Conservatoire National de Musique et de Déclamation—the great
training school of French actors-who returned the following reply :-
“ Seine Porte (Seine-et-Marne). Monsieur,-Il est evident que la
gesticulation peut s'enseigner comme l'intonation, mais dans quelle
mesure, c'est là ce qu'il est fort difficile de regler. Il faut consulter
la nature de l'élève, et le caractére du morceau. L'exemple que vous
citez du discours de Rienzi me parait renfermer des indications justes,
mais en pareil cas il faut voir pour décider. Je ne puis que vous
remercier, au nom de l'art de diction, des efforts que vous faites pour la
transporter en Angleterre, et je ne doute qu'avec l'esprit d'initiative et
d'intelligante ardeur que vous y apportez, vous ne puissiez arriver à des
resultats heureux. Personne ne s'enfelicitera plus que moi, et je vous
prie d'agréer l'expression de mes sentiments les plus distingués.---E.
LEGOUVÉ.”

ELOCUTION, VOICE, AND GESTURE.
BY RUPERT GARRY.
CROWN 8vo., 160 pages, PRICE Is., POST FREE, Is. 2d.
Opinions of the Press.
)
)
>
H.M. the Queen, and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales have each
graciously accepted a copy of “Elocution, Voice, and Gesture.”
“ The Bishop of Rochester hastens to give Mr. Garry his best
thanks for the kind gift of his book on a most useful subject.”
“A lady has, at my suggestion, got your admirable work.”—Rev. C.
E. Tisdall, D.D., Chancellor of Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin, and
President of the Association of Elocutionists.
“Mr. Garry's complaints of the tone of 'stilted affectation' in
which some preachers deliver sermons, and the painfully unsuccessful
efforts of others to intone, belong to a different category. They will
awaken painful reminiscences among the members of many afflicted con-
gregations.”—Extract from a Leaderette in “ Daily News.”
“There can be no doubt that Elocution is an art, and as such must
be studied, even by the most naturally gifted. Hence the value of a
good teacher, such as Mr. Garry certainly appears to be.
His re-
marks on what may be called the mechanism of Elocution are sensible
and useful, as is also his chapter on the Voice. His hints on Gesture
will furnish the student with many admirable suggestions. Altogether
the work may be recommended as really a practical one.”—Queen.
This cheap little treatise, stored from the first to the
last page with useful hints, apt examples and practical rules, makes
most profitable reading alike for the actor and elocutionist. The sec-
tion on the Voice is well considered and trustworthy, based as it is on
the writings of authorities on the questions of the Hygiene of the Vocal
Organs.”—Stage.
“The Book contains many valuable hints in regard to Voice and
Gesture."— Voice (New York).
“Coming from the pen of a well-known teacher of Elocution, it is
sure to meet with that welcome and approval which the work merits.
It contains various well-written articles on the art and nature
of Elocution, with some very valuable hints on modulation and emphasis.
The book is intended not only for reciters, but for speakers and readers ;
and there is, indeed, a very useful chapter devoted to the last-mentioned.
All who aspire to dramatic art cannot do better than provide themselves
with this admirable little compendium.”—Dramatic Review.
“MR. RUPERT GARRY writes a brief but excellent work on 'Elocu-
tion, Voice, and Gesture.' Touching first on the charm and importance

of a correct and expressive mode of speaking, he proceeds to lay down
some clear and simple rules for attaining this desirable end. Though
everyone cannot become proficient in the art-still, by practice and
careful attention to the writer's instructions, considerable improvement
may be made in the power, compass and quality of the voice and
the delivery of the words. A few useful voice remedies are given, of the
good effect of which Mr. Garry speaks from personal experience.”-
Morning Post.
“A practical treatise, full of sound advice. A very useful little
work.”—Literary World.
“Used as a supplement to the vivâ voce explanations of a good
teacher, the book will be of use. Constant practice under the super-
vision of a competent instructor is essential; but the knowledge of the
theory contained in this book will render that practice more effectual.”
-Schoolmaster (London).
“ It is not often that so good a manual is met with. If that curse of
modern society, the amateur reciter, must exist, the least he can do for
his victims is to go through a preliminary course of training, such as is
most lucidly laid down for him by MR. GARRY
The possession
and study of this volume would be greatly to the advantage of many of
our actors and orators. It includes a number of pieces, most admirably
and laboriously annotated.”—Court and Society Řevier.
Special attention may be directed to the chapter on
Lifeless Delivery, which is perhaps the most interesting and valuable
in the whole work.”—Cily Press.
A good many attempts, more or less successful, have
been made from time to time to reduce to a system the great general
principles by which the full expression may be given to poetry and prose
in reading, reciting, and public speaking. Never, however, has the sub-
ject been more practically and lucidly treated than in MR. Garry's
little treatise. The author is himself a successful teacher of the art of
Elocution, and in the simple rules that he lays down and elaborates, he
has, we think, embodied all the essentials of intelligent and expressive
diction. |--School Board Chronicle.
“We commend the information given to the attention of all students
and scholars in our colleges and schools.”—Irish Educational Journal.
“ This work has been looked for with considerable interest, as ema-
nating from the pen of a writer of so practical an experience as Mr.
GARRY. The author, with true wisdom, eschewing 'long-winded and
professedly-learned essays or lectures, which are absolutely of no
practical value, commences with a sound and able treatise on the
requisites of a good delivery and the best methods of obtaining or per-
fecting them; the development of tone ; the rules governing articulation
and pronunciation; and all the delicate phases of that factor of factors
in the elocutionary art-expression ; this essay alone, so understandable
and yet so essentially at the root of subjects treated, is well worth a
large addition to the nominal price charged for the book.
When to the items above-mentioned is added a section upon the vocal
organs, and explanatory of how the voice should be best produced, and
why it should be produced in a certain way,' the tout ensemble seems a
very complete one.
The important element of gesture, as
distinct from gesticulation, is awarded a special chapter, and its intelli.

gent study is helped by copious hints and sterling advice."— Institute
and Lecturer's Gazette.
“ MR. RUPERT GARRY is the author of a treatise of Elocution, Voice,
and Gesture, in which he very clearly expounds the rules of his art and
the principles on which those rules are based, and explains, in a popular
manner, the physiology of the organs on which good voice production
depends.
The book exhibits in every page evidence of the
author's enthusiasm and profound study of his subject.”—Scottish
Leader (Edinburgh).
'MR. Rupert Garry's manual is brief and well-written. It has a
good number of examples marked with directions for speech and gesture,
and stands out among works of the kind by the practical quality of its
suggestions.”—Scotsman (Edinburgh.)
Although we are not too favourably disposed—as a rule-to written
instructions on this subject, it is impossible to refuse praise to MR.
Garry for the pains he has bestowed upon his work. The best parts of
it are those in which he treats of 'The Voice' and of 'Vocal Remedies.'
MR. GARRY's book is a cheap one and should be popular."-
Glasgow Herald.
“A useful little work on Elocution, Voice, and Gesture has been
written by Mr. Rupert Garry, who is well qualified to speak on
the subject, and gives a great deal of sound and practical advice, borne
out by numerous quotations from and references to the great masters
of the art.
Most people might read Mr. Garry's little book
with profit, if it only drew their attention to the value of a little
elocutionary exercise, for it is surprising how the art is neglected;
young people who have a knowledge of continental and dead languages
being quite unable to recite a few lines of verse in their own language
in a manner which gives the slightest pleasure to their auditors.
In common with other doctors, Sir H. Holland recommends recitation
for strengthening the vocal organs.”—Hants Observer.
“The book is very lucid and concise in its directions, and the
principles which govern elocution are set forth in such a manner that
they cannot fail to be understanded of the people.'
These are
principles which all who ever read or speak in public should master, and
are entirely separate from the management of the voice and gesture.
In each section careful instructions are given.”—Somerset Co. Herald.
“MR. GARRY, a teacher of wide experience, here gives short,
simple, and clear explanations of the principles of Elocution. In
the section on the Voice, he teaches how the voice should be best
produced, and why it should be produced in a certain way.
The valuable advice should be carefully weighed by men who are to
appear before public, especially Clergymen.”-- Perthshire Advertiser.
“This is a work at once useful and opportune, owing its authorship
to MR. RUPERT GARRY, who will be remembered as the professional
judge at the Annual Elocutionary Competition in 1886. The gradual
growth of this excellent art has given birth to many works, having, for
their more ostensible object, its more successful study, but too often
proving to be mere airings of the fads of their authors. MR. GARRY'S
book, however, is lucid and practical ; there is no waste of words, and,
consequently, its perusal is not an arduous and mystifying study,

The author gives some valuable information as to the use and manage.
ment of the Vocal Organs—a feature quite novel in this class of work.”
-Portsmouth Times.
“Here, within the compass of a crown 8vo. volume, young and am.
bitious menibers of Parliamentary Debating Societies may find a clear
and intelligible indication of the straight road to true eloquence, while
those who aspire to shine on the stage will find much to help them.
His advice to amateur actors is especially good. The section
which deals with the Voice gives an explanation of the structure of the
Vocal Organs, and includes a series of remedies for curing defects of
the voice. The fact that this part of Mr. Garry's work has been re-
vised by an able throat specialist will give it additional value. A
separate chapter is devoted to gesture; and more than fifty pages are
occupied by annotated pieces for exercise, in which, by the free use of
italics, accents, bars, and marginal notes, the utmost is done for the
student that can possibly be done for him on paper."—Western Daily
Mercury.
Elocution, Voice, and Gesture,' by MR. RUPERT GARRY, is
likely to become a regular reference book on the subject. Unlike
most of the works in existence, which are either diffuse and compli-
cated, or else so overladen with rules which are not sufficiently ex-
plained, we have here everything so clearly and concisely explained
ihat anyone, however ignorant of elocution before taking up the book,
will have gained a perfect apprehension of it, more particularly if he
studies carefully the annotated pieces at the end, in which the advice
previously given is practically demonstrated. The section on the
Voice is almost unique in a book on such a subject, and will prove of
invaluable assistance to all who have occasion to use their voice, and
who wish to avoid injuring it, as so many are doing at present by using
it in the wrong way.”-West Sussex Gazette.
