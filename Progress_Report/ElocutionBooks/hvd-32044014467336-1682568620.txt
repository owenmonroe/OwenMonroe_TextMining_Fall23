FRANÇOIS DELSARTE.
François Delsarte was born November 11, 1811, at
Solesme, a little town of the Department of the North, in
France. His father, who was a renowned physician and
the author of several inventions, might have secured a
fortune for his family, had he been more anxious for the
morrow, but he died in a state bordering upon poverty.
In 1822, François was apprenticed to a porcelain painter
of Paris, but, yielding to a taste and aptitude for music, in
the year 1825, he sought and obtained admission to the
Conservatory as a pensioner. Here a great trial awaited
hima trial which wrecked his musical career, but was a
decided gain for his genius. He had been placed in the
vocal classes, and in consequence of faults in method and
direction, he lost his voice. He was inconsolable, but,
without making light of his sorrow, we may count that
lons happy, which gave the world its first law-giver in the
art of oratory
The young student refused to accept this calamity
without making one final effort to retrieve it. He pre-
sented himself at the musical contest of 1829. His im-
paired voice rendered success impossible, but kind words
from influential friends in a great measure compensated
for defeat.
The celebrated Xourrit said to him : "I have given you

singing-master but you."
“Courage," said Madame Malibran, pressing his hand.
You will one day be a great artist.”
But Delsarte knew that without a voice he must re-
nounce the stage, and yielding to the inevitable, he gave
up the role of the actor to assume the functions of the
professor. Iſter his own shipwreck upon a bark without
pilot or compass, he summoned up courage to search into
the laws of an art which had hitherto subsisted only upon
caprice ani personal inspiration.
After several years of diligent stuly, he discovered and
formulaieil the essential laws of all art; and, thanks to
him, ästhetic science in our day has the same precision

many of whom have become distinguished in various
public careers—in the pulpit, at the bar, on the stage, and
at the tribune.
Madame Sontag, when she wished to interpret Gluck's
music, chose Delsarte for her teacher. Rachel drew
inspiration from his counsels, and he became her guardian
of the sacred fire. He was urgently solicited to appear
wib her at the Theatre-Français, but religious scruples
leil him to refuse the finest offers.
Madame de Giradin (Delphine Gay), surnamed the
Muse of her country, welcomed him gladly to her salon,
then the rendezvous of the world of art and letters, and
regretted not seeing him oftener. He was more than
once invited to the literary sessions of Juilly college, and,
under the spell of his diction, the pupils became animated
by a new ardor for study.

the salon of this art-loving archbishop that Delsarte
achieved one of his most brilliant triumphs. .All the
notable men of science had gathered there, and the con-
versation took such a turn that Delsarte found opportu-
nity to give, without offence, a challenge in these two
lines of Racine:
L'orde approchi, si briso, il tromit à nos jour,
Parmi dis flots d'écuma, un monstre furioux,
("The wave draws near, it breaks, and casts before our cyes,
Amid the Moods of foam, a monster grim and dire.")

“ Please tell me the most emphatic and significant
woril here," said I)elsarte.
Al reflecteil, sought out and then gave, each in turn,
his chosen woril. Every word was selecied save the con-
junction of (anıl). No one thought of that.
Delsarte then rose, and in a calm and modest, but
triumphant tone, said: “The significant, emphatic world
is the only one which has escapeıl you. It is the con-
junction and, whose elliptic sense leaves us in appre-
hension of that which is about to happen." All owned
themselves vanquished, and applauded the triumphant
artist.
Donoso Cortés made Delsarte a chosen confidant of
his ideas. One day, when the great master of oratorical
diction hall recited to him the Dics Inc, the illustrious
philosopher, in an access of religious emotion, beggel
that this hymn might be chanted at his funeral. Delsarte
promised it, and he kept his word.
When invited to the court of Louis Philippe, he re-
plied : “ I am not a court buffoon.” When a generous
compensation was hinted at, he answered: “I do not se!
my loves." When it was urged that the occasion was a
birth-day fote to be given his father by the Duke of

Orleans, he accepted the invitation upon three con-
clitions, thus stated by himself: “ ist. I shall be the only
singer; 2d. I shall have no accompaniment but the
opera chorus; 30. I shall receive no compensation."
The conditions were assented to, and Delsarte surpassed
himself. The king paid him such marked attentions that
M. Ingres felt constrained to say: "One might declare in
truth that it is Delsarte who is king of France.”
Delsarte's reputation had passed the frontier. The
king of Hanover committed to his instruction the greatest
musical artiste of his realm, and was so gratified with her
improvement that, wishing to recompense the professor,
he sent him the much prized Hanoverian medal of arts
and sciences, accompanied by a letter from his own royal
hand. Delsarte afterwards received from the same king
the cross of a Chevalier of the Guelph order.
Delsarie's auclitors were not the only ones to sound
his praises. The learned reviews extolled his merits.
Such writers as Laurentie, Riancey, Lamartine and
Théophile Gautier awarded him the most enthusiastic
praise. Posterity will perpetuate his fame.
M. Laurentic writes: “I heard Delsarte recite one
evening Iphigeni's Dream,' which the audience had
Tresought of him. The hall remained thrilled and breath-
lexs under this impaired and yet sovereign voice. All
yielleil in rapt astonishment to the spell. There was no
prestige, no theatrical illusion. Iphigenia was a professor
in a black frock coat; the orchestra was a piano, giving
forth here and there an unexpected modulation. This
was his whole ſorce; yet the hall was mute, hearts beat,
lears flowed from many eyes, and when the recital ended,
enthusiastic shouts arose, as if Iphigenia in person had
jusi recounted her terrors.

BIOGRAMICAL.

After Delsarte had gathered so abundant a harvest
of laurels, fate decided that he had lived long enough.
When he had reached his sixtieth year, he was attacked
by hypertrophy of the heart, which left his rich organiza-
tion in ruins. He was no longer the artist of graceful,
supple, expressive and harmonious movements; no longer
the thinker with profound and luminous ideas. But in the
midst of this physical and intellectual ruin, the Christian
sentiment retained its strong, sweet energy. A believer in
che sacraments which he had received in days of health,
he asked for them in the hour of danger, and many times
he partook of that sacrament of love whose virtue he had
taught so well.
Finally, after having lingered for months in a state
that was neither life nor death, surrounded by his pious
wife, and his weeping, praying children, he rendered his
soul to Goll on the zoth of July, 1871.
Delsarte never could be persuaded to write anything
upon themes foreign to those connected with his musical
and vocal work. The author of this voiunc desires to
save from oblivion the most wonderful conception of this
superior intellect: his Course of Esthetic Oratory'. He
dares promise to be a faithful interpreter. If excuse be
needed for undertaking a task so delicate, he replies that
he addresses himself to a class of readers who will know
how to appreciate his motives.
The merit of Delsarte, the honor of his family, the
gratification of his numerous friends, the interests of
science, the claims of friendship, demand that this light
shouid not be left under a bushel, but placed upon a
candlestick-this light which has shed so brilliant a glow,
and enriched the arts with a new splendor.

PREFACE.
Orators, you are called to the ministry of speech. You
have fixed your choice upon the pulpit, the bar, the tri-
bune or the stage. You will become one day, preacher,
alvocate, lecturer or actor ; in short, you «lesire to cm-
brace the orator's carecr. I applaus your design. You
will enter upon the noblest and mo.it glorious of voca-
tions. Eloquence holds the first rank among the arts.
While we award praise and glory to great musicians and
painters, to great masters of sculpture and architecture,
the prize of honor is clecreed to great orators.
Who can define the omnipotence of speech? With a
few brief words God called the universe from nothing-
ness; speech falling from the glowing lips of the Apostles,
has changed the face of the earth. The current of opin-
ion follows the prestige of speech, and to-clay, as ever,
eloquence is universal qucen. We need feel no surprise
that, in ancient times, the multitude uncovered as Cicero
approached, and cried : “Behold the orator!"
Would you have your speech bear fruit and command
honor? Two qualities are needful : virtue and a knowl-
edge of the art of oratory. Cicero has defined the ora-
tor as a good man of worth: Vir bonus, diccndi peritus.
Then, above all, the orator should be a man of worth.
Such a man will make it his purpose to do good; and the

PREFACE.
good is the true end of oratorical art. In truth, what is
art? Art is the expression of the beautiful in ideas; it is
the true. Plato says the beautiful is the splendor of the
true.
What is art? It is the beautiful in action. It is the
good. According to St. Augustine, the beautiful is the
lustre of the good.
Finally, what is art? It is the beautiful in the harmo-
nies of nature. Galen, when he had finished his work
on the structure of the human body, exclaimed : “ Behold
this beautiful hymn to the glory of the Creator !"
What, then, is the true, the beautiful, the good? We
might answer, it is God. Then virtue and the glory of
God should be the one end of the orator, of the good
man. A true artist never denies God.
Eloquence is a means, not an end. We must not love
art for its own sake, that would be idolatry. Art gives
wings for ascent to God. One need not pause to con-
template his wings.
Art is an instrument, but not an instrument of vanity
or complaisance. Truth, alas! compels us to admit that
eloquence has also the melancholy power of corrupting
souls. Since it is an art, it is also a power which must
produce its effect for good or evil.
It has been said that the fool always finds a greater
fool to listen to him. We might add that the false, the
ugly and the vicious have each a fibre in the human heart
to serve their purpose. Then let the true orator, the good
man, armed with holy eloquence, seek to paralyze the
fatal influence of those orators who are apostles of false.
hood and corruption.
Poets are born, orators are made: nascuntur pocta, fiunt
oralores. You understand why I have engraved this max.

im on the title-page of my work. It contains its raiso:
d'étre, its justification. Men are poets at birth, but elo-
quence is an art to be taught and learned. All art pre-
supposes rules, procedures, a mechanism, a method which
must be known.
We bring more or less aptitude, to the study of an art,
but every profession demands a period more or less pro-
longed. We must not count upon natural advantages;
none are perfect by nature. Humanity is crippled; beauty
exists only in fragments. Perfect beauty is nowhere to
be ſound; the artist must create it by synthetic work.
You have a fine voice, but be certain it has its defects.
Your articulation is vicious, and the gestures upon which
you pride yourself, are, in most cases, unnatural. Do not
rely upon the fire of momentary inspiration. Nothing is
more deceptive. The great Garrick said: “I do not de.
pend upon that inspiration which idle mediocrity awaits.”
Talma declared that he absolutely calculated all effects,
leaving nothing to chance. While he recited the scene
between Augustus and Cinna, he was also performing an
arithmetical operation. When he said:
“ Take a chair, Cinna, and in everything
Closely observe the law I bid you heed
he made his audience shudder.
The orator should not even think of what he is doing.
The thing should have been so much studied, that all
would seem to flow of itself from the fountain.
But where find this square, this intellectual compass,
that traces for us with mathematical precision, that line of
gestures beyond which the orator must not pass ? I have
sought it for a long time, but in vain. Here and there
one meets with advice, sometimes good but very often

PREFACT..
baui. For example, you are told that the greater the
emotion, the stronger should be the voice. Nothing is
more false. In violent emotion the heart seems to fill the
larynx and the voice is stifled. In all such counsels it
behooves us to search out their foundation, the reason
that is in them, to ask if there is a type in nature which
serves as their measure.
We hear a celebrated orator. We scek to recall, to
imilate his intlections and gestures. We avlopt his man-
nerisms, and that is all. ll see these mannerisms every-
where, but the true type is nowhere.
After much unavailing search, I at last had the good
fortune to meet a genuine master of cloquence. After
giving much study to the masterpieces of painting and
sculpture, after observing the living man in all his moods
and expressions, he has known how to sum up these
details and reduce them to laws. This great artist, this
unrivaled master, was the pious, the amiable, the lamented
Delsarte.
There certainly was pleasure and profit in hearing this
master of eloquence, for he excelled in applying his prin-
ciples to himself. Still from his teachings, even from the
dead letter of them, breaks forth a light which reveals
horizons hitherto unknow'n.
This work might have been entitlel : Philosophy of
Oratorical Art, for one cannot treat of eloquence without
entering the domain of the highest philosophy.
What, in fact, is oratorical art? It is the means of
expressing the phenomena of the soul by the play of the
organs. It is the sum total of rules and laws resulting
from the reciprocal action of mind and body. Thus man
must be considered in his sensitive, intellectual and moral
state, with the play of the organs corresponding to these

PREFACE.
xiii
states. Our teaching has, then, for its basis the science of
the soul ministered to by the organs. This is why we
present the fixed, invariable rules which have their sanc-
tion in philosophy. This can be rendered plain by an
exposition of our method.
The art of oratory, we repeat, is expressing mental
phenomena by the play of the physical organs. It is the
translation, the plastic form, the language of human
nature. But man, the image of God, presents himself to
us in three phases : the sensitive, intellectual and moral.
Man feels, thinks and loves. He is en rapport with the
physical world, with the spiritual world, and with God.
He fulfils his course by the light of the senses, the reason,
or the light of grace.
We call life the sensitive state, mind the intellectual
state, and soul the moral state. Neither of these three
terms can be separated from the two others. They inter-
penetrate, interlace, correspond with and embrace each
other. Thus mind supposes soul and lite. Soul is at the
same time mind and life. In fine, life is inherent in mind
and soul. Thus these three primitive moods of the soul
are distinguished by nine perfectly adequate terms. The
soul being the form of the body, the body is made in the
image of the soul. The human bodly contains three
organisms to translate the triple form of the soul.
The phonetic machinery, the voice, sound, inflections,
are living language. The child, as yet devoid of intelli-
gence and sentiment, conveys his emotions through cries
and moans.
The myologic or muscular machinery, or gesture, is the
language of sentiment and emotion. When the child
recognizes its mother, it begins to smile.


## p. xiv (#39) #############################################

PREFACE.
The buccal machinery, or articulate speech, is the lan-
guage of the mind.
Man, neither by voice nor gesture, can express two
opposite ideas on the same subject; this necessarily
involves a resort to speech. Human language is com-
posed of gesture, speech and singing. The ancient melo-
drama owed its excellence to a union of these three lan.
guages.
Each of these organisms takes the eccentric, concen-
tric, or normal form, according to the different moods of
the soul which it is called to translate.
In the sensitive state, the soul lives outside itself; it has
relations with the exterior world. In the intellectual state,
· the soul turns back upon itsell, and the organism obeys
this movement. Then ensues a contraction in all the
agents of the organism. This is the concentric state. In
the moral or mystic state, the soul, enraptured with God,
enjoys perfect tranquility and blessedness. All brenthes
peace, quietude, serenity. This is the normal state, -
the most perfect, elevated and sublime expression of
which the organism is capable.
J.ct us not forget that by reason of a constant transition,
cach state borrow's the form of its kindred state. Thus
the normal state can take the concentric and eccentric
form, and lxecome at the same time, doubly normal; that
is, normal to the highest degree. Since each state can
take the form of the two others, the result is nine distinct
gestures, which form that marvelous accord of nine,
which we call the universal criterion.
In fine, here is the grand law of organic gymnastics :
The triple movement, the triple language of the organs
is eccentric, concentric, or normal, according as it is the
expression of liſe, soul or spirit.

of art.
Under the influence, the occult inspiration of this law,
the great masters have enriched the world with miracles
Aided by this law the course followed in this
work, may be easily understood.
Since eloquence is composed of three languages, we
divide this work into three books in which voice, gesture
and speech are studied by turns. Then, applying to them
the great law of art, our task is accomplished.
The advantages of this method are easily understool.
There is given a type of expression not taken from the
individual, but from human nature synthetized. Thus
the student will not have the humiliation of being the
slave or ape of any particular master. He will be only
himself. Those who assimilate their imperfect natures to
the perfect type will become orators. Fiunt Oratores.
Success having attended the first efforts, let the would-
be orator assimilate these rules, and his power will be
doubled, aye increased a hundredfold. And thus having
become an orator, a man of principle, who knows how
to speak well, he will aid in the triumph of religion, jus-
tice and virtue.

PRELIMINARY IDEAS — CRITERION OF THE ORA-
TORICAL ART.
Let us note an incontestable fact. The science
of the Art of Oratory has not yet been taught.
Hitherto genius alone, and not science, has made
grcat orators. Horace, Quintilian and Ciccro among
the ancients, and numerous modern writers have
trcatcd of oratory as an art. We admirc their writ-
ings, but this is not scicncc; here we scck in vain
the fundamental laws whence their teachings pro-
cccd. There is no scicncc without principles which
give a reason for its facts. Hence to teach and to
learn the art of oratory, it is ncccssary:
1. To understand the general law which controls
the movements of the organs;.
2. To apply this general law to the movements
of each particular organ;
3. To understand the meaning of the form of
each of these movements;

PRELIMINARY IDEAS.
4. To adapt this meaning to cach of the different
states of the soul.
The fundamental law, whose stamp every one of
these organs bcars, must be kept carefully in mind.
Here is the formula:
The sensitive, mental and moral state of man are
rendered by the eccentric, concentric or normal
form of the organism.*
Such is the first and greatest law. There is a
second law, which proceeds from the first and is
similar to it:
Each form of the organism becomes triple by
borrowing the form of the two others.
It is in the application of these two laws that the
entire practice of the art of oratory consists. Here,
then, is a science, for we possess a criterion with
which all phenomena must agree, and which none
can gainsay. This criterion, composed of our
double formula, we represent in a chart, whose ex-
planation must be carefully studied.
The three primitive forms or genera which affect
the organs are represented by the three transverse
lines.
*The sensitive is also called the vital, the mental the reflective, and the moral the
effective state. The vital sustains, the mental guides, the moral impela - Trans-
LATOL.

The subdivision of the three gencra into nine spe-
cies is noted in the thrcc perpendicular columns.
Under the title Genus we shall use the Roman
numcrals I, III, II.
Under the title Species we employ the Arabic
figures 1, 3, 2.
I designates the eccentric form, II the concentric
form, III the normal form.
The Arabic figures have the same signification.
The normal form, either in the genus or the spe-
cics, we place in the middle column, because it
scrves as a bond of union between the two others,
as the moral state is the connecting link between
the intellectual and vital states.


## p. 6 (#51) ###############################################

PRELIMINARY IDEAS.
Thus the first law relative to the primitive forms
of the organs is applied in the three transverse col-
umns, and the second law relative to their com-
Pound forms is reproduced in the three vertical
columns.
As may be easily proven, the eccentric genus
produces three species of eccentric forms, marked
in the three divisions of the lower transverse column.
Since the figure i represents the eccentric form,
I-I will designate the form of the highest degree of
eccentricity, which we call eccentro-cccentric.
Since the figure 3 represents the normal form,
the numbers 3-1 will indicate the normo-eccentric
form.
Since the figure 2 designates the form which
translates intelligence, the figures 2-1 indicate the
concentro-eccentric form as a specics. As the species
Proceeds from the genus, we begin by naming the
Species in order to bring it back to the genus.
Thus, in the column of the eccentric genus the
figure 1 is placed after the numbers 3 and 2, which
belong to the specics. We must apply the same
analysis to thc transverse colunin of the normal
genus, as also to that of the concentric genus.
Following a diagonal from the bottom to the top
and from left to right, we meet the most expressive
form of the species, whether eccentric, normal or
concentric, marked by the figures 1-1, 3-III, 2-II,
and by the abbreviations Ecc.-ecc. (Eccentro-eccen-
tric), Norm.-nor:n. (Normo - normal), Conc.-conc.

(Concentro-concentric). It is curious to remark
how upon this diagonal the organic manifestations
corresponding to the soul, that is to love, are found
in the midst, to link the expressive forms of life and
mind.
This chart sums up all the essential forms which
can affect the organism. This is a universal alge-
braic formula. by which we can solve all organic
problems. We apply it to the hand, to the shoul-
der, to the cyes, to the voice - in a word, to all the
,
a
agents of oratorical language. For example, it suf-
ficcs to know the eccentro-eccentric form of the hand,
of the eyes; and we reserve it for the appropriate
occasion.
All the figures accompanying the text of this
work are only reproductions of this chart affected
by such or such a particular organ. A knowledge
of this criterion gives to our studies not only sim-
plicity, clearness and facility, but also mathematical
precision.
In proposing the accord of nine formed by the
figure 3 multiplied into itself, it must be understood
that we give the most elementary, most usual and
least complicated terms. Through natural and suc-
cessive subdivisions we can arrive at 81 terms.
Thus multiply 9 by 3;. the number 27 gives an
accord of 27 terms, which can again be multiplied
by 3 to reach 81. Or rather let us multiply 9 by 9,
and we in like manner obtain 81 terms, which be-
come the end of the series. This is the alpha and

Omega of all human science. Huc usque vcnies, et
ibi confringes tumentes fluctus tuos. (“Thus far
shalt thou come, and here shall thy proud waves
be stayed.")
It is well to remark that this criterion is applied
to all possible phenomena, both in the arts and
sciences. This is reason, universal synthesis. All
phenomena, spiritual as well as material, must be
considered under three or nine aspects, or not be
understood. Three genera and nine species; three
and nine in everything and everywhere; three and
nine, these are the notes echoed by all beings.
We do not fear to affirm that this criterion is divine,
since it conforms to the nature of beings. Then,
with this compass in hand, let us explore the vast
field of oratorical art, and begin with the voice.

CHAPTER II.
!
OF THE VOICE.
!
The whole secret of captivating an audience by
the charms of the voice, consists in a practical
knowledge of the laws of sound, inflection, respira-
tion and silence. The voice first manifests itself
through sound; inflection is an intentional modifi-
cation of sound; respiration and silence are a means
of falling exactly upon the suitable tone and in-
flection.
Sound being the first language of man in the
cradle, the least we can demand of the orator is,
that he speak intelligently a language whose author
is instinct. The orator must then listen to his own
voice in order to understand it, to estimate its value,
to cultivate it by correcting its faults, to guide it-
in a word, to dispose of it at will, according to the
inclination of the moment. We begin the study of
the voice with Sound; and as sound may be viewed
under several aspects, we divide this heading into as
many sections.
ompass of the Voice - Organic Apparatus of the
Voice.
This apparatus is composed of the larynx, the
mouth and the lungs. Each of these agents derives

+
its value from mutual action with the others. The
larynx of itself is nothing, and can be considered
only through its participation in the simultaneous
action of the mouth and lungs.
Sound, then, is formed by a triple agent - pro-
jective, vibrative and reflective.
The lungs are the soliciting agent, thc larynx is
the vibrative agent, the mouth is the reflective
agent. These must act in unison, or there is no
result. The larynx might be called the mouth of
the instrument, the inside of the mouth the pavilion,
the lungs the artist. In a violin, the larynx would
be the string, the lungs the bow, the mouth the in-
strument itself.
The triple action of these agents produces pho-
nation. They cngender sounds and inflections.
Sound is the revelation of the sensitive life to the
minutest degree; inflections are the revelation of
the same life in a higher degree, and this is why
thcy are the foundation and the charm of music.
Such is the wonderful organism of the human
voice, such the powerful instrument Providence has
placed at the disposal of the orator. But what
avails the possession of an instrument if one does
not know how to use it, or how to tune it? The
orator, ignorant of the laws of sound and inflection,
resembles the debutant who places the trumpet to
his lips for the first time. We know the ear-tortur-
ing toncs he evolves.
The car is the most delicate, the most exacting

of all our senses. The eye is far more tolerant.
The eye resigns itself to behold a bad gesture, but
the ear does not forgive a false note or a false in-
flection. It is through the voice we plcase an
audience. If we have the ear of an auditor, we
easily win his mind and heart. The voice is a mys-
terious hand which touches, cnvelops and caresses
· the heart.
Of the Voice in Relation to Compass.
All voices do not have the same compass, or the
sanie range.
By range we mcan the number of
tones the voice can produce below and above a
given note on the staff, say A, sccond space of the
treble clef.
There are four distinct kinds of voices: Soprano,
alto, tenor and bass. There are also intermediate
voices, possessing the peculiar quality of the kind
to which it belongs, for example: Mczzo-soprano,
with the quality of the soprano and only differing
from the soprano in range, the range of this voice
being lower than the soprano and a little higher
than the alto. Then comes thc alto or contralto.
In the male voice we have the tenor robusto, a
little lower than the pure tenor and more powerful ;
next the baritone, a voice between the tenor and
bass, but possessing very much the quality of the
bass.
The tones in the range of every voice can be
divided into three parts — the lower, medium and

higher. Thus we would say of a performer, he or
she used the lower or higher tones, or whatever the
case may be. This applies to every kind of voice.
The soprano voice ranges generally from the
middle C, first added line below on the treble clef,
upwards to A, first added line above the staff.
Contralto voices range generally from G, below
middle C in the treble clef, up to F, the upper line
of the clef.
The tenor voice ranges from C, second space of
the F clef, to D, second space in the treble clef.
The bass voice ranges from lower F, first space
below of the F or bass clef, to D, second space
above of this clcf.
The first perception of the human voice impera-
tively demands, i. That the voicc be tricd and its
Compass measured in order to ascertain to what
species it belongs. Its name must be known with
absolute certainty. It would be shameful in a mu-
sician not to know the name of the instrument he
uses. 2. That the car be trained in order to distin-
guish the pitch upon which one spcaks.
We should be able to name a sound and to sound
a name. The Orientals could sing cight degrecs of
tone between C and D. There may be a whole scale,
a whole air betwecn these two tones. It would be
•The registers here given undoubtedly refer to the singing voice, as the range of

unpardonable not to know how to distinguish or at
least to sound a semitone.
There is a fact proved by experience, which must
not be forgotten. The high voice, with elevated
brows, serves to express intensity of passion, as well
as small, trivial and also pleasant things.
The deep voice, with the eyes open, expresses
worthy things.
The deep voice, with the eyes closed, expresses
odious things.
The Voice in Rclation to Vowels.
As already stated, the vocal apparatus is com-
posed of the lungs, the larynx and the mouth; but
its accessories are the teeth, the lips, the palate and
the uvula. The tip and root of the tongue, the
arch of the palate and the nasal cavities have also
their share in perfecting the acoustic apparatus.
In classifying the different varicties of voice, we
have considered them only in their rudimentary
state. Ability to name and distinguish the several
tones of voice is the starting point. We have an
image more or less perfect, leaving the mould; we
have a canvas containing the design, but not the
embroidery - the mere outline of an instrument, a
body without a soul. The voice being the language
of the sensitive life, the passional state must pass
entirely into the voice.
We must know then how to give it an expression,
a color answering to the sentiment it conveys. But

this expressive form of the voice depends upon thic
sound of its vowels.
Thore is a mother vowel, a gcncrative tone. It is
a (Italian a). In articulating a the mouth opens
wide, giving a sound similar to a in arm.
The primitive a takes threc forms. The unac-
cented, Italian a represents the normal state; a with
the acute accent (') represents the eccentric state;
a with the grave accent (') represents the concen-
tric state.
These three a's derived from primitive a become
each in turn the progenitor of a family with triple
sounds, as may be seen in the following gencalogi-
cal tree:
A
А
А
Å
o
au
cu
ou
Eccentric.
Normal.
Concentric.
This is the only simple sound, but four other
sounds are derived from it. The three a's articu-
lated by closing the uvula, give the nasal an. Each
family also gives its special nasal sound: in for the
eccentric voice, on for the normal state, un for the
concentric. All other sounds are derived from
Combinations of these. The mouth cannot possibly
produce more than three families of sounds, and in
each family it is a united with the others that forms
the trinity


## p. 15 (#60) ##############################################

THE VOICE IN RELATION TO VOWELS.
15
The variety of sounds in these three families of
vowels arises from the difference of the opening of
the mouth and lips in articulating them. Thesc
different modes of articulation may be rendered
more intelligible by the subjoined diagrams:
ů is pronounced with the mouth very wide open,
the uvula raised and the tongue much lowered.

é, è, i and in arc articulated with the lips

closed.
a, au, ou and on are articulated with the back of
the mouth open and the lips gradually closed.
C, cu, u and un arc articulated with the back of
the mouth and the lips uniformly closed.
The voice takes different names, according to
the different sounds in cach family of vowels: the
chest-voice, the medium voice and the head-
voice.
These names imply no change in the sort of
voice, but a change in the manner of emission.
The head, medium or chest-voice, indicates only

variety in the emission of vowels, and may be
applied to the high as well as the deep and medium
voice. Thus the deep voice may produce sounds
in the head-voice, as well as in the medium and
chest voices.
The head-voice is produced by lowering the lar-
ynx, and at the same time raising the uvula. In
swallowing, the larynx rises by the clevation of the
uvula, without which elevation there can be no
head-tones.
Practical Conclusions.
1. It is highly important to know how to assume
cither of thcsc voices at will. The chest-voice is
the expression of the sensitive or vital liſc, and is the
interpreter of all physical emotions. The mcdium
voice expresses sentiment and the moral emotions.
The head-voicc interprets everything pertaining to
scientific or mental phenomena. By observing the
laugh in the vital, moral and intellectual states, we
shall see that the voice takes the sound of the
vowel corresponding to cach state.
We understand the laugh of an individual; if
upon the i (e long), he has made a sorry jest; if
upon € (a in fate), he has nothing in his heart and
most likely nothing in his head; if upon a (a
short), the laugh is forced. O, 1, (a long) and ou
are the only normal expressions. Thus every one
is measured, numbered, weighed. There is reason
in everything, even when unknown to man. In

PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS.

physical pain or joy, the laugh or groan employs
the vowels e, ii.
2. The chest-voice should be little used, as it is a
bestial and very fatiguing voice.
3. The head-voice or the medium voice is pref-
crable, it being more noble and more ample, and
not fatiguing. In these voices there is far less dan-
ger of hoarseness. The head and medium voices
proceed more from the mouth, while the chest-voice
has its vibrating point in the larynx.
4. The articulation of the three syllables, la, mo
and po, is a very uscful exercise in habituating one
to the medium voice. Besides reproducing the
tone of this voice, these are the musical consonants
par cxccllence. They give charm and devclopment
to the voice. We can repeat these tones without
fatiguing the vocal chords, since they are produced
by the articulative apparatus.
5. It is well to remark that the chest, medium

CHAPTER III.
THE VOICE IN RELATION TO INTENSITY OF SOUND.
What is Understood by Intensity of Sound.
The voice has three dimensions — height, depth
-
and breadth; in other terms, diapason, intensity and
duration; or in yet other words, tonality, timbre
and succession.
Intensity may be applied alike to the voice and
to sound. The voice is strong or weak, according
to the mechanism of the acoustic apparatus. The
strength or weakness of sound depends upon the
speaker, who from the same apparatus evolves
toncs more or less strong. It is the forte, piano
and pianissimo in music. Thus a loud voice can
render wcak toncs, and a weak voicc loud toncs.
Hence the tones of both are capable of increase or
diminution.
Mians of Augmenting the Timbrc of the Voice.
1. A stronger voice may be obtained by taking
position not upon the heel or flat of the foot, but
upon the ball near the toes—that attitude which
-
further on we shall designate as the third. The
chest is cccentric; that is, convex and dilated. In
this position all the muscles are tense and resemble
the chords of an instrument whose resonance is pro-
portional to their tension.


## p. 20 (#65) ##############################################

20
VOICE.
2. There are three modes of developing the voice.
A voice may be manufactured. A natural voice is
almost always more or less changed by a thousand
deleterious influences.
1. In coluwe, by lowering the larynx, clevating
the soft-palate and hollowing the tongue.
2. In intensity.-A loud voice may be hollow.
It must be rendered deep, forcible and brilliant by
these three methods : profound inspiration, explo-
sion and expulsion. The intensity of an effect may
depend upon cxpulsion or an clastic movement.
Tenuity is clasticity. It is the rarest and yet the
most essential quality of diction.
3. In compass.—There are three ways of increas-
ing the compass of the voice:
1. By the determination of its pitch;
2. By practicing the vocal scale;
3. By the fusion of the registers upon the key-
note.
The first of these methods is most cffective. The
second consists in exercising upon thosc notes
which are near the key-notc. Upon this cxercise
depends in great measure the homogeneity of the
voice. Taking la for the diapason, the voice which
extends from the lowest notes to upper re is the
chest-voice, since it suffers no acoustic modification.
From mi to la the voice is modified; it is the me-
dium voice, or the second register, which gives full
and supple tones. The head or throat-voice, or the
third register, extends from si to the highest and

sharpest notes. Its toncs are weak, and should be
avoided as much as possible. There are then only
ſour good notes - those from mi to la, upon
which
the voice should be cxercised. By uniting the reg-
isters, an artificial, homogencous voice may be cre-
ated, whose tones are produced without compression
and without difficulty. This being donc, it is evi-
dent that cvery note of the voice must successively
indicate the three registers — that is, it must be
-
rendered in the chest, medium and head voices.
There is also a method of diminishing the voice.
As the tone is in proportion to the volume of air in
the lungs, it may be weakened by contracting the
epiglottis or by suppressing the respiration.
.
Rules for Intensity of Sound.
1. The strength of the voice is in an inverse ratio
to the respiration. The more we are moved, the less
loudly we speak; the less the cmotion, the stronger
the voice. In emotion, the heart scems to mount
to the larynx, and the voice is stiflcd. A soft tone
should always be an affecting tone, and consist only
of a brcath. Force is always opposed to power. It
is an error to supposc that the voice must be in-
creased as the heart is laid barc. The lowest toncs
are the best understood. If we would make a low
voice audible, let us speak as softly as we can.
Go to the sea-shore when the tempest rages.
The roar of the waves as thcy break against the
vessel's side, the muttering thunders, the furious

wind-gusts render the strongest voicc impotent.
Go upon a battle-ficld whicn drums bcat and trum-
pets sound. In the midst of this uproar, these dis-
cordant crics, this tumult of opposing armies, the
leader's commands, though uttered in the loudest
toncs, can scarcc bc hcard; but a low whistle will
be distinctly audible. The voice is intense in seren-
ity and calm, but in passion it is weak.
Let those who would bring forward subtle argu-
ments against this law, remember that logic is often
in default when applicd to artistic facts.
A concert is given in a contracted space, with an
orchestra and a double-bass. The double-bass is
very wcak. Logic would suggest two double-basses
in order to produce a stronger tone. Quite the
contrary. Two double-basses give only a scmitone,
which half a double-bass renders of itself. So
much for logic in this case.
The greatest joy is in sorrow, for here there is
the greatest love. Other joys are only on the sur-
face. We suffer and we weep because we love.
or what avail are tcars? The essential thing is
to love. Tears are the accessories; they will come
in time, they need not be sought. Nothing so
wearics and disgusts us, as the lachrymosc tone. A
man who amounts to anything is never a whimperer.
Take two instruments in discord and remote from
each other. Logic forbids their approach lost their
tones become more disagrecable. The reverse is
true. In bringing them together, the lowest be-

come lost in the draperics. The voice should scarce
reach these too hcavy or too sonorous partitions,
but leaving the lips softly, it should pulsate through
the audience, and go no farther.
An audience is aslecp. Logic demands more
warmth, more fire. Not at all. Keep silent and
the slecpers will awaken.
2. Sound, notwithstanding its many shades, should
be homogeneous; that is, as full at the end as at the
beginning. The mucous membrane, the lungs and
the expiratory muscles have sole charge of its trans-
mission. The vocal tube must not vary any more
for the loud tone than for the low tone. The
opening must bc thc samc. Thc low tone must
have the power of the loud tonc, since it is to be
equally understood. The acoustic organs should
have nothing to do with the transmission of sound.
They must be inert so that the tone may be homo-
geneous. The speaker or singer should know how
to diminish the tone without the contraction of the
back part of the mouth.
To be homogencous the voice must be ample.
To render it ample, take high rather than low notes.
The dipthong cu (like u in muff), and the vowels a
and o give amplitude to sound. On the contrary,

the tone is meagre in articulating the vowels é, i and
4. To render the voice ample, we open the throat
and roll forth the sound. The more the sound is
circumvoluted, the more ample it is. To render the
voice resonant, we draw the tongue from the teeth
and give it a hollow form; then we lower the lar-
ynx, and in this way imitate the French horn.
3. The voice should always be sympathetic, kind-
ly, calm, and noble, even when the most repulsive
things are expressed. A tearful voice is a grave
defect, and must be avoided. The same may be
said of the tremulous voice of the aged, who em-
phasize and prolong their syllables. Tears are out
of place in great situations; we should weep only
at home. To weep is a sure way of making people
laugh.

CHAPTER IV.
TITE VOICE IN RELATION TO MEASURE.
Of Slowness and Rapidity in Oratorical Delivery.
The third and last rclation in which we shall
study voicc, is its brcadth, that is, thc mcasure or
rhythm of its tones.
The object of mcasure in oratorical diction is to
rcgulate the interval of sounds. But the length of
the interval between onc sound and another is sub-
jcct to the laws of slowness and rapidity, respira-
tion, silence and inflcction.
Lct us first consider slowness and rapidity, and
the rules which govern them.
1. A hasty delivery is by no means a proof of
animation, warmth, firc, passion or cmotion in the
orator; hence in delivery, as in tonc, hastc is in an
inverse ratio to cmotion. We do not glide lightly
over a beloved subject; a prolongation of toncs is
the complaisance of love. Precipitation awakens
suspicions of heartlessncss; it also injures the effect
of the discourse. A teacher with too much facility
or volubility puts his pupils to sleep, because hic
· leaves them nothing to do, and they do not under-
stand his meaning. But let the teacher choose his
words carefully, and every pupil will want to suggest
some idca; all will work. In applauding an orator

we usually applaud ourselves. He says what we
were just ready to say; we seem to have suggested
the idea. It is superfluous to remark that slowness
without gesture, and especially without facial ex-
pression, would be intolerable.. A tone must always
be reproduced with an expression of the face.
2. The voice must not be jerky. Here we must
keep jealous watch over ourselves. The entirc in-
terest of diction arises from a fusion of toncs. The
toncs of the voice are sentient beings, who love,
hold converse, follow each other and blend in a
harmonious union.
3. It is never nccessary to dwell upon the sound
we have just loſt; this would be to fall into that
jerky tone we wish to avoid.
Of Respiration and Silence.
We place respiration and silence under the same
head because of their affinity, for respiration may
often be accounted silence.
Of silence.- Silence is the father of speech, and
must justify it. Every word which docs not pro-
ceed from silence and find its vindication in silence,
is a spurious word without claim or title to our
regard. Origin is the stamp, in virtue of which we
recognize the intrinsic value of things. Let us, then,
seek in silence the sufficient reason of speech, and
remember that the more enlightened the mind is,
the more concise is the speech that proceeds from
it. Let us assume, then, that this conciseness keeps

OF RESPIRATION AND SILENCE.
27
pace with the clevation of the mind, and that when
the mind arrives at the perception of the true light,
finding no words that can portray the glories open
to its view, it keeps silent and admires. It is
through silence that the mind riscs to perfection, for
silcncc is the speech of God.
Apart from this consideration, silence recom-
mends itself as a powerful agent in oratorical cffects.
By silence thic orator arouses the attention of his
audience, and often decply moves their hicarts.
When Peter Chrysologuc, in his famous homily
upon the gospel miracle of the hcaling of the issue
of blood, overcome by emotion, pauscd suddenly
and remained silent, all present immediately burst
into sobs.
Furthermore, silence gives the orator time and
liberty to judge of his position. An orator should
never speak without having thought, rcfccted and
arranged his ideas. Before speaking he should de-
cide upon his stand-point, and sce clearly what he
proposes to do. Even a fable may be related from
many points of view; from that of expression as
well as gesture, from that of infection as well as
articulate speech. All must be brought back to a
scene in real life, to one stand-point, and the orator
must create for himself, in some sort, the role of
spectator.
Silence gives gesture time to concentrate, and do
good execution.
One single rule applies to silence: Wherever


## p. 28 (#73) ##############################################

28
VOICE.
there is ellipsis, there is silence. Hence the inter-
jection and conjunction, which are essentially ellip-
tic, must always be followed by a silence.
Respiration. For the act of respiration, three
movements are necessary: inspiration, suspension
and expiration.
Its importancc.- Respiration is a faithful render-
ing of emotion. For example: He who reigns in
the skics. Here is a proposition which the com-
posed orator will state in a breath. But should
he wish to prove his emotion, he inspires after every
word. Hc-who- reigns - in - the - skics. Multi-
plied inspirations can be tolerated on the strength
of emotion, but they should be made as effective as
possiblc.
Inspiration is allowable:-
1. After all words preceded or followed by an
ellipse;
2. After words used in apostrophe, as Monsieur,
Madame;
3. After conjunctions and interjections when there
is silence;
4. After all transpositions ; for example: To live,
one must work. Here the preposition to takes the
value of its natural antecedent, work; that is to say,
six degrees, since by inversion it precedes it, and
the gesture of the sentence bears wholly on the
preposition;
5. Before and after incidental phrases;
6. Wherever we wish to indicate an emotion.

To facilitate respiration, stand on tip-toe and ex-
pand the chest.
Inspiration is a sign of grief; cxpiration is a sign
of tenderness. Sorrow is inspiratory; happiness,
expiratory.
The inspiratory act expresses sorrow, dissimulation.
The expiratory act expresses love, expansion,
sympathy.
The suspensory act expresses reticence and dis-
quictude. A child who has just been corrected de-
servedly, and who recognizes his fault, cxpires.
Another corrected unjustly, and who feels more
gricf than love, inspires.
Inspiration is usually regulated by the signs of
punctuation, which have been invented solely to
give more exactness to the variety of sounds.
Inflections.
Their importance.- Sound, we have said, is the
language of man in the sensitive state. We call
infections the modifications which affect the voice
in rendering the emotions of the senses. The tones
of the voice must vary with the sensations, each of
which should have its note. Of what use to man
would be a phonetic apparatus always rendering
the same sound? Delivery is a sort of music whose
excellence consists in a variety of tones which rise
or fall according to the things they have to express.
Beautiful but uniform voices resemble fine bells
whose tone is sweet and clear, full and agreeable,

but which are, after all, bells, signifying nothing,
devoid of harmony and conscquently without vari-
cty. To employ always the same action and the
same tone of voicc, is like giving the same remedy
for all diseases. · Ennui was born one day from
monotony," says the fable.
Man has received from God the privilege of rc-
vealing the inmost affcctions of his being through
the thousand inficctions of his voice. Man's least
impressions are conveyeď by signs which reveal har-
mony, and which are not the products of chance.
A sovereign wisdom governs these signs.
With the infant in its cradle the signs of sensi-
bility are broken crics. Their acuteness, their as-
cending form, indicate the weakness, and physical
sorrow of man. When the child recognizes the
tender cares of its mother, its voice becomes less
shrill and broken; its toncs have a less acute range,
and are more poiscd and cven. The larynx, which
is very impressionable and the thermometer of the
sensitive life, becomes modificd, and produces sounds
and inflections in perfect unison with the sentiments
they convey.
All this, which man expresses in an imitative fash-
ion, is numbered, weighed and measured, and forms
an admirable harmony. This language through the
larynx is universal, and common to all sensitive be-
ings. It is universal with animals as with man. Ani-
mals give the identical sounds in similar positions.
The infant, delighted at being mounted on a table,

and calling his mother to admire him, rises to the
fourth note of the scalc. If his delight becomes
more lively, to the sixth; iſ the mother is less
pleased than he would have her, he ascends to the
third minor to express his displeasure. Quietude
is expressed by the fourth note.
Every situation has its interval, its corresponding
inflection, its corresponding note: this is a mathe-
matical language.
Why this magnificent concert God has arranged
in our midst if it has no auditors? If God had
made us only intelligent bcings, he would have
given us speech alone and without infcctions. Let
us further illustrate the rôle of inficction.
A father reccivcs a picture from his daughter.
He expresses his gratitude by a falling inflection :
“Ah well! the dear child." The picture comes
from a stranger whom he docs not know as a painter;
he will say, “Well now! why docs he send me
this?" raising his voice.
If he docs not know from whom the picture
comes, his voice will neither risc nor fall; he will
say, “Well! well! well !"
Let us suppose that his daughter is the painter.
She has exccuted a masterpiece.
Astonished at
the charm of this work and at the same time -grate-
ful, his voice will have both inflections.
If surprise predominates over love the rising in-
flection will predominate. If love and surprise are
equal, he will simply say, “Well now !"

k'an in Chinese signifies at the same time the
roof of a house, a cellar, well, chamber, bed-the
inficction alone dctcrmines the meaning. Roof is
expressed by the falling, cellar by the rising inflcc-
'tion. The Chinesc noto accurately the depth and
acuteness of sound, its intervals and its intensity.
We can say: “It is pretty, this little dog!” in 675
different ways. Some one would do it harm. We
say: “This little dog is pretty, do not harm it!”

Rules of Inflcction.
1. Inflections are formed by an upward or down-
ward slide of the voice, or the voice remains in
monotone. Inflections are, then, eccentric, concen-
tric and normal.
2. The voicc riscs in cxaltation, astonishment,
and conflict.
3. The voice falls in affirmation, affcction and de-
jection.
4. It neither rises nor falls in hesitation.
5. Interrogation is expressed by the rising inficc-
tion when we do not know what we ask; by the
falling, when we do not quite know what we ask.
For instance, a person asks tidings of his friend's
health, aware or unaware that he is no better.

are pleasing. Courtiers give musical inflections to
the words they address to royalty.
7. Every manifestation of life is a song; cvery
sound is a song:
But inflections must not bc multi-
plicd, lest delivery degencrate into a perpetual sing-
song. The effect lics entirely in reproducing the
samc infcction. A drop of water falling constantly,
hollows a rock. A mediocre man will cmploy
twenty or thirty tones. Mediocrity is not the too
little, but the too much. The art of making a pro-
found impression is to condense; the highest art
would be to condense a whole scene into one infcc-
tion. Mediocre speakers are always sceking to en-
rich their inflcctions; they touch at cvery range,
and lose themselves in a multitude of intangible
cffects.
8. In real art it is not always necessary to fall
back upon logic. The rcason nccds illumination
from nature, as the cyc, in order to scc, nccds light.
Reason may be in contradiction to nature. For
instance, a half-famished hunter, in sight of a good
dinner, would say: "I ain hungry,” cmphasizing
hungry, while rcason would say that am must be
emphasized. A hungry pauper would say: "I am
hungry,” dwelling upon am and gliding over kun-
try. If he were not hungry, or wished to deceive,
he would dwell upon hungry.

Special Inflections.
Among the special infections we may reckon: -
1. Exclamations. - Abrupt, loud, impassioned
sounds, and improvisations.
2. Crics.— These are prolonged exclamations
called forth by a lively sentiment of some duration,
as acute suffering, joy or terror. They are formed
by the sound ü. In violent pain arising from a
physical cause, the crics assume three different
tones: one grave, another acute, the last being the
lowest, and we pass from one to the other in a chro-
matic order.
There are appealing cries which ask aid in peril.
These crics are formed by the sounds ė and .
They are slower than the preceding, but more acute

and formed by two successive toncs, the one sharp,
the final onc dccp. Its monotony, the constant
rccurrence of the same inflcction, give it a remark-
able expression.
4. Lamentation is produced by a voice loud,
plaintive, despairing and obstinatc, indicating a
heart which can neither contain nor restrain itself.

sounds produced by slight, continuous inspirations,
in some sort convulsive, and ending in a long, vio-
lent inspiration.

somewhat convulsive, of a tone more or less acute
and prolonged, and produced by a deep inspiration.

CHAPTER I.
OF GESTURE IN GENERAL.
Human word is composed of three languages.
Man says what he feels by inflections of the voice,
what he loves by gesture, what he thinks by articu-
late speech. The child begins with feeling; then
he loves, and later, he reasons. While the child
only feels, cries suffice him; when he loves, he
needs gestures; when he reasons, he must have
articulate language. The inflections of the voice
are for sensations, gesture is for sentiments; the
buccal apparatus is for the expression of ideas.
Gesture, then, is the bond of union between inflec-
tion and thought. Since gesture, in genealogical
order, holds the second rank in human languages,
we shall reserve for it that place in the series of our

be the Abbé de l'Epéc, who, by uniting the science
of gesture to the conventional signs of dactyology,
has made the deaf hear and the dumb spcak! This
bencficent invention has made gesture in a twofold
manner, the language of the heart.
Gesture is an important as well as interesting
study. How beautiful it is to see the thousand
picces of the myological apparatus sct in motion
and propelled by this grand motor feeling! There
surely is a joy in knowing how to appreciate an
image of Christ on the cross, in understanding the
attitudes of l'aith, Hope and Charity. We can note
a mother's affcction by the way she holds her child
in her arms. We can judge of the sincerity of the
friend who grasps our hand. If he holds tlic thumb
inward and pendant, it is a fatal sign; we no longer
trust him. To pray with the thumbs inward and
swaying to and fro, indicates a lack of sacred fervor.
It is a corpse who prays. If you pray with the
arms extended and the fingers bcnt, there is reason
to fear that you adore Plutus. If you cmbrace me
without elevating the shoulders, you are a Judas.
What can you do in a museum, if you have not

bcauty of the statue of Antinous ? How can you
note a fault in Raphael's picture of Moses making

powerless to express. For example: I love. This
phrase says nothing of the nature of the being loved,
nothing of the fashion in which one loves. Gesture,
by a simple movement, revcals all this, and says it
far better than speech, which would know how to
render it only by many successive words and phras-
cs. A gesture, then, like a ray of light, can reflect
all that passes in the soul.
Hence, if we desire that a thing shall be always
remembered, we must not say it in words; we must
let it be divined, revealed by gesture. Wherever an
cllipse is supposable in a discourse, gesture must
intcrvene to explain this ellipsc.
3. Gesture is an Elliptical Language:--We call
ellipse a hidden meaning whose revelation belongs
to gesturc. A gesture must correspond to every
ellipse. For example: “This medley of glory and
gain vexes mc." If we attribute something igno-
minious or abject to the word meilley', there is an
cllipse in the phrase, because the ignominy is im-
plied rather than expressed. Gesture is then neces-
sary here to express the value of the implied adjec-
tive, ignominions.
Suppress this ellipse, and the gesture must also
be suppressed, for gesture is not the accompaniment
of speech. It must cxpress the idea better and in
another way, clse it will be only a pleonasm, an after
conception of bad taste, a hindrance rather than an
aid to intelligible expression.

DIVISION OF GESTURE,
45
Division of Gesture,
Every act, gesture and movement has its rule, its
cxccution and its raison d'étro The imitative is
also divided into three parts: the static, the dy-
namic and the semciotic. The static is the base,
the dynamic is the centre, and the semciotic the
summit. The static is the cquipondcration of the
powers or agents; it corresponds to life.
The dynamic is the form of movements. Thc
dynamic is melodic, harmonic and rhythmic. Ges-
ture is melodic by its forms or its inflcctions. To
understand gesture one must study melody. There
is great affinity between the inflections of the voice
and gesture. All the inflections of the voice are
common to gesture. The inflections of gesture are
oblique for the life, direct for the soul and circular
for the mind. These three terms, oblique, direct
and circular, correspond to the eccentric, normal
and concentric states. The movements of flection
are direct, those of rotation, circular, those of ab-
duction, oblique.
Gesture is harmonic through the multiplicity of
the agents which act in the same manner. This
harmony is founded upon the convergence or oppo-
sition of the movements. Thus the perfect accord
is the consonance of the three agents,— head, torso
and limbs. Dissonance arises from the divergence
of one of these agents.
Finally, gesture is rhythmic because its move-

ments are subordinated to a given mcasure. The
dynamic corresponds to the soul.
Thc scmciotic gives thc reason of movements,
and has for its object the careful examination of
infcctions, attitudes and types.

of gesture in general; under our second, of the

CHAPTER III.
ORIGIN AND ORATORICAL VALUE OF GESTURE.
Origin.
The infant in the cradle has ncither specch nor
gesture: - he cries.
As he gains sensibility his
tones grow richer, become inflections, are multiplicd
and attain the number of three million special and
distinct inflections. The young infant manifests
neither intelligence nor affcction; but he reveals his
life by sounds. When he discerns the source of
his joys or sufferings, he loves, and gesticulates to
repulse or to invite. The gestures, which are few
at first, become quite numerous. It is God's art hc
follows; he is an artist without knowing it.
Oratorical l'aluc of Gesturc.
The true aim of art is to move, to interest and to
persuade. Emotion, interest and persuasion are
the first terms of art. Emotion is expressed by the
voice, by sounds; interest, by language; persuasion
is the office of gesture.
To inflection belongs emotion through the beau-
tiful; to logic, interest through the truth; to plastic
art, persuasion through the good.
Gesture is more than speech. It is not what we
say that persuades, but the manner of saying it.
The mind can be interested by speech, it must be


## p. 48 (#103) #############################################

GESTURE.
persuaded by gesture. If the face bears no sign of
persuasion, we do not persuade.
Why at first sight does a person awaken our
sympathy or antipathy? We do not understand
why, but it is by reason of his gestures.
Speech is inferior to gesture, because it corre-
sponds to the phenomena of mind; gesture is the
agent of the heart, it is the persuasive agent.
Articulate language is weak because it is succes-
sive. It must be enunciated phrase by phrase; by
words, syllables, letters, consonants and vowels-
and these do not end it. That which demands a
volume is uttered by a single gesture. A hundred
pages do not say what a simple movement may ex-
press, because this simple movement expresses our
whole bcing. Gesture is the direct agent of the
soul, while language is analytic and successive.
The Icading quality of mind is number; it is to
spcculate, to reckon, while gesture grasps every-
thing by intuition.-scntiment as well as contempla-
tion. There is something marvelous in this lan-
guage, because it has relations with another sphere;
it is the world of grace.
An audience must not be supposed to resemble
an individual. A man of the greatest intelligence
finding himself in an audience, is no longer himself.
An audience is never intelligent; it is a multiple
bcing, composed of sense and sentiment. The
greater the numbers, the less intelligence has to do.
To seek to act upon an individual by gesture would

be absurd. The reverse is true with an audience;
it is persuaded not by reasoning, but by gesture.
There is here a current none can control. We
applaud disagreeable things in spite of ourselves
things we should condemn, were they said to us in
private. The audience is not composed of intellec-
tual people, but of people with senses and hearts.
As sentiment is the highest thing in art, it should
be applicd to gesture.
If the gestures are good, the most wretched
speaking is tolerated. So much the better if the
speaking is good, but gesture is the all-important
thing. Gesture is superior to each of the other
languages, because it embraces the constituent parts
of our being. Gesture includes everything within
Sound is the gesture of the vocal apparatus.
The consonants and vowels are the gesture of the
buccal apparatus, and gesture, properly so called, is
the product of the myological apparatus.
It is not ideas that move the masses; it is gestures.
We easily reach the heart and soul through the
senses. Music acts especially on the senses. It
purifies them, it gives intelligence to the hand, it
disposes the heart to prayer. The three languages
may each move, interest and persuade.
Language is a sort of music which moves us
through vocal expression; it is besides normal
through the gesture of articulation. No language
is exclusive. All interpenetrate and communicate
their action. The action of music is gencral.

The mind and the life are active only for the
satisfaction of the heart; then, since the heart con-
trols all our actions, gesture must control all other
languages.
Gesture is magnetic, speech is not so. Through
gesture we subdue the most ferocious animals.
The ancients were not ignorant of this all-power-
ful empire of gesturc over an audience. Thcrcforc,
sometimes to paralyze, sometimes to augment this
magic power, orators were obliged to cover their
faces with a mask, when about to speak in public.
The judges of the Arcopagus well knew the power
of gesture, and to avoid its scductions, they adopted
the resource of hearing plcas only in the darkness.
The sign of the cross made at the opening of a
sermon often has great effect upon good Catholics.
Let a priest with his eyes concentric and introspec-
tive make dclibcratcly the sign of the cross while
solemnly uttering these words: “In - the - nanie -
of-the-Father;" then let his glance sweep the
audience. What do they think of him? This is
no longer an ordinary man; he scems clothed with
the majesty of God, whosc orders he has just re-
ceived, and in whose name he brings them. This
idea gives him strength and assurance, and his audi-
ence respect and docility.

CHAPTER IV.
THE LAWS OF GESTURE.
The static treats of the laws of gesture which are
six in number, viz.: Priority, retroaction, the oppo-
sition of agents, unity, stability and rhythm.
1
D
The Priority of Gesture to Speech.
Gesture must always precede specch. In fact,
speech is reflected expression. It must come after
gesture, which is parallel with the impression re-
ceived. Nature incites a movement, specch names
this movement. Speech is only the title, the label
of what gesture has anticipated. Speech comes
only to confirm what the audience already compre-
hend. Speech is given for naming things. Gesture
asks the question, “What?" and specch answers.
Gesture after the answer would be absurd. Let the
word come after the gesture and there will be no
pleonasm.
Priority of gesture may be thus explained: First
a movement responds to the sensation; then a ges-
ture, which depicts the emotion, responds to the
imagination which colors the sensation. Then
comes the judgment which approves. Finally, we
consider the audience, and this view of the audience
suggests the appropriate expression for that which
has already been expressed by gesture,


## p. 52 (#107) #############################################

52
GESTURE.
The basis of this art is to make the auditors
divine what we would have them feel.
Every speaker may choose his own stand-point,
but the essential law is to anticipate, to justify specch
by gesture. Specch is the verifier of the fact ex-
cx-
pressed. The thing may bc cxpressed before an-
nouncing its name. Sometimes we let the auditors
divine rather than anticipate, gazing at them in
order to rivet their attention. Eloquence is com-
posed of many things which are not named, but
must be named by slight gestures. In this clo-
qucncc consists. Thus a smack of the tongue, a
blow upon the hand, an utterance of the vowel ni
as if one would remove a stain from his coat. The
writer cannot do all this. The mere rendition of the
written discourse is nothing for the orator; his tal-
ent consists in taking advantage of a great number
of littlc nameless sounds.
A written discourse must contain forced cpithets
and adjectives to illustrate thc subject. In a spoken
discourse a great number of adjectives are worse
than uscless. Gesture and inflection of the voice
supply their place. The sense is not in the words;
it is in inflection and gesture.
Retroaction.
We have formulated this general law: The
cccentric, normal and concentric expression must
correspond to the sensitive, moral and intellectual
state of man. When gesture is concerned, the law

RETROACTIOX.
53
:
is thus modified: In the sensitive state, the gesture,
which is naturally eccentric, may become concen-
tric, as the orator is passive or active.
He is passive when subject to any action what-
ever, when he depicts an emotion.
He is agent when he communicates to the au-
dience the expression of his own will or power: ia
a word, at all times when he controls his audience.
When the orator assumes the passive rôle, that is,
when he reflects, he gazes upon his audience; he
makes a backward (or concentric) movement; when
he assumes the active rôle, he makes a forward (or
eccentric) movement. When one spcaks to others,
he advances; when one speaks to himself, he recoils
a step, his thought centres upon himself.
In the passive state, one loves. But when he
loves, he does not move forward. A bcing who
feels, draws back, and contemplates the object
toward which the hand extends. Contemplation
makes the body retroact.
Hence in the passive state, the orator must step
backward. In the opposite state he moves forward.
Let us apply this law: A spendthrift officer mccts
his landlord, whom he has not yet paid, and greets
him with an—"Ah, good day, sir!" What will be
his movement? It must be retroactive. In the joy
of sccing a friend again, as also in fright, we start
back from the object loved or hated. Such is the
law of nature, and it cannot be ignored.
Whence comes this law? To bchold a loved
a

object fully, we must step back, remove to some
little distance from it. Look at a painter admiring
his work. It is retroaction at sight of a beloved
person, which has led to the discovery of the phe-
nomena of life, to this tripic staic of man which is
found in like manner, everywhere: Concentric, cc-
centric, and normal.
The concentric is the passive state, for when one
experiencos a deep cmotion, he must retroact.
Hence a demonstration of affection is not made
with a forward movement. If so, there is no love.
Expiration is the sign of him who gives his heart.
Hence there is joy and love. In inspiration there
is retroaction, and, in some sort, distrust. The hand
extends toward the bcloved object; if the hand
tend toward itself, a love of self is indicated. Love
is expressed by a retroactive, never by a forward
movement. In portraying this sentiment the hand
must not be carried to the hcart. This is nonsensc;
it is a: oratorical crime. The hand must tend
1
toward the loved being to caress, to grasp, to reas-
sure or to deſund. The hand is carried to the heart
only in case of suffering there.
Take this passage from Racinc's Phèdre:
Dicumque ne puis-je i l'ombre des forêts,
Suivre de l'ail un char fuyant dans la carrière-
(“God-may I not, through the dim forest shades,
With my glance follow a fleet chariot's course.")
Here thc actor does not follo: affectionately, but

with the eye, and then by recoiling and concentrat-
ing his thought upon himself.
In the rôle of Emilic:
“He may in falling crush thee 'neath his fall,”
at sight of her crushed lover Emilic must recoil in
terror, and not seem to add the weight of her body
to that which crushes the victim.
Augustus, on the contrary, may say:
“I might in falling crush thcc 'neath iny fall,”
pausing upon a forward movement, because he is
here the agent.
Let us note in passing that the passive attitude is
the type of cnergetic natures. They have some-
thing in themselves which suffices them. This is a
sort of repose ; it is clasticity.
Opposition of Agents.
The opposition of the agents is the harmony of
gesturc. Harmony is born of contrasts. From
opposition, cquilibrium is born in turn. Equilib-
rium is the great law of gesture, and condemns par-
allelism; and these are the laws of cquilibrium :
1. The forward inclination of the torso corre-
sponds to the movement of the log in the opposite
direction.
2. When one arm is added to the weight of the
already inclined torso, the other arm must rise to
form a counterpoise.
3. In gazing into a well, the two arms must be

56

lada obi del simba
drawn backward if the body is equally supported
by the two legs; in like manner the two arms may
be carried in front if the torso bends backward.
This is allowable only in the first attitude of the
basc, or in a similar attitude.
The harmonic law of gesture is the static law par
excellence.
It is of childlike simplicity. We employ it in
walking; also when we carry a weight in one hand,
the other riscs. The law consists in placing the
acting levers in opposition, and thus realizing cqui-
librium. All that is in cquilibrium is harmonized.
All ancient art is based upon this opposition of
levers. Modern art, with but few exceptions, is
quite the contrary.
Here is an example of the observance of this
rule: If the head and arms are in action, the head
must move in opposition to the arms and the hand.
If both move in the same direction, there is a defect
in cquilibrium, and awkwardness results.
When the arm riscs to the head, the head bends
forward and meets it half-way. The reverse is truc.
Every movement in the hand has its responsive
movement in the head. If the head advances, the
hand withdraws. The movements must balance, so
that the body may be in cquilibrium and remain
balanced.
Here is the difference between ancient and
modern art. Let us suppose a statue of Corncille
reading his works. To-day we should pose it with

NUMBER OF GESTURES.
57
one leg and arm advanced. This is parallelism.
Formerly the leg would have been opposed to this
movement of the arm, because there should be here
the expansion of the author toward his work, and
this expansion results precisely from an opposition
of levers.
We know the ancient gladiator; we do exactly
the opposite from him in fencing.
Modern art makes the man walk with leg and
arm parallel. Ancient art would have the leg
opposed to the arm.
It is through opposition that the smilc cxprcsscs
moral sadness. This law of opposition must be
observed in the same member. For example, the
hand should be opposed to the arm. Thus we have
magnificent spheroidal movements which are gracc-
ful and also have considerable force. Thus all the
harmonies occur in one samc wholc, in onc samo
truth. In a word, all truths interpenctratc, and
when a thing is true from one point of view, it is so
from all.
Number of Gestures.
Many reasons go to prove that gestures need not
be multiplied:
A.-We are moved by only onc sentiment at a
time; hence it is useless to multiply gestures.
B.—But one gesture is nccded for the expression
of an entire thought; since it is not the word but
the thought that the gesture must announce; if it


## p. 58 (#113) #############################################

GESTURE.
expressed only the word, it would be trivial and
mean, and also prejudicial to the effect of the phrase.
In these phrases: “What do you seek in the
world, happiness? It is not there,” that which
first strikes us is the absence of happiness. Gesture
must indicate it in advance, and this should be the
dominating movement.
The intelligent man makes fcw gestures. To
multiply gestures indicates a lack of intelligence.
The face is the thermometer of intelligence. Let
as much expression as possible be given to the face.
A gesture made by the hand is wrong when not
justified in advance by the face. Intelligence is
manifested by the facc. When the intelligent man
speaks, he employs great movements only when they
are justificd by great exaltation of sentiment; and,
furthermore, these sentiments should be stamped
upon his face. Without expression of the face, all
gestures resemble telegraphic movements.
C.—The repeated extension of the arms denotes
but little intelligence, little suppleness in the wrist
and fingers. The movement of a single finger indi-
cates great fincsse.
It is easy to distinguish the man of head, heart
and actions. The first makes many gestures of the
head; the second many of the shoulders; the last
moves the arms often and inappropriately.
D.-Gesture is allowable only when an ellipse of
the word or phrase admits of an additional value.
E.-Effects must not be multiplied; this is an

NUMBER OF GESTURES.
59
essential precaution. Multiplied movements are
detrimental when a graver movement is awaited.
F.-The orator is free to choose between the role
of actor or that of more spectator or narrator. Neither
the one nor the other can be forced upon him. The
actor's role arises not from intelligence but simply
from instinct. The actor identifics himself with the
personages he represents. He renders all their sen-
timents. This rôle is the most powerful, but, before
making it the object of his choice, there must be
severe study; he must not run the risk of frivolity.
We can dictate to the preacher and mark out his
path. He must not be an actor, but a doctor. Hence
his gestures must never represent the impressions of
those of whom he spcaks, but his own. Hence he
should proportion the number of his gestures to the
number of his sentiments.
G.-If the orator would speak to any purpose,
he must bring back his discourse to some picture
from nature, some scene from real life.
There must be unity in everything; but a róle
may be condensed in two or three traits; therefore
a great number of gestures is not necessary.
Let it be carefully noted: the expression of the
face should make the gesture of the arms forgotten.
Here the talent of the orator shines forth. He must
captivate his public in such a way that his arm ges-
tures will be ignored. He must so fascinate his
auditors that they cannot ask the reason of this fas-
cination, nor remark that he gesticulates at all.


## p. 60 (#115) #############################################

GESTURE.
H.-Where there are two gestures in the same
idea, one of them must come before the proposition,
the other in its midst.
If there is but one gesture and it precedes the
proposition, the term to which it is applied must be
precisely indicated.
For example: Would he be scnsible to friendship?
Although friendship may in some degree be quali-
fied as the indirect regimen, gesture should portray
it in all its attributes.
.
-
Duration of Gesture.
The suspension or prolongation of a movement is
one of the great sources of effect. It is in suspen-
sion that force and interest consist. A good thing
is worth being kcpt in sight long cnough to allow an
enjoyment of the vicw.
The orator should rest upon the preceding ges-
ture until a change is absolutely required.
A preoccupied man greets you with a smile, and
after you have left, he smiles on, until something
else occurs to divert his mind.
The orator's abstraction should change the face,
but not the gesture. If the double change takes
place simultaneously, there will be no unity. The
gesture should be retained and the expression of the
face changed.
A variety of cffects and inflections should be
avoided. While the speaker is under the influence
of the same sentiment, the same inflection and ges-

THE RHYTHM OF GESTURE.
61
ture must be retained, so that there may be unity
of style.
Art proposes three things: to move, to interest,
to persuade by unity of inflection and gesture.
One effect must not destroy another. Divergence
confuses the audience, and leaves no time for
sentiment.
It is well to remember that the stone becomes
hollowed by the incessant fall of the drop of water
in the same place.
:
The Rhythm of Gesture.
Gesture is at the same time melodic, or rather
inflective, harmonic and rhythmic. It must em-
brace the elements of music, since it corresponds to
the soul; it is the language of the soul, and the soul
necessarily includes the life with its diverse methods
of expression, and the mind. Gesture is mclodic or
inflective through the richness of its forms, har-
monic through the multiplicity of parts that unite
simultaneously to produce it. Gesture is rhythmic
through its movement, more or less slow, or more
or less rapid.
Gesture is, then, inevitably synthetic, and conse-
quently harmonic; for harmony is but another
name for synthesis.
Each of the inflective, harmonic and rhythmic
modes has its peculiar law.
The rhythmic law of gesture is thus formu-
lated :


## p. 62 (#117) #############################################

62
GESTURE.
“ Thc rhythm of gesture is proportional to the
mass to be moved."
The more an organ is restrained, the more vehe-
ment is its impulse.
This law is based upon the vibration of the pen-
dulum. Grcat lovers have slow movements, small
agents more rapid ones. The hcad moves more
rapidly when the torso and the cye have great
facility of motion. Thus the titillations of the cye
are rapid as lightning.
This titillation always announces an cmotion.
Surprise is feigned if there is no titillation.
l'or example, at the unexpected visit of a friend
there is a lighting up of the eye. Wherefore?
Because the image is active in the imagination.
This is an image which passes within ourselves,
which lies in inward phenomena.
So in relation to material phenomena: there is a
Convergence, a direction of the cyes toward the
object; if the object changes place, the cyes cannot
modify their manner of convergence; they must
close to find a new direction, a convergence suited
to the distance of the object.
There is never sympathetic vision. The phe-
nomena of the imagination are in the imagination

IMPORTANCE OF THE LAWS OF GESTURE. 63
"At last I have him in my power,
This fatal foe, this haughty conqueror!
Through him my captives leave their slavery."
Here the body must be calm; there is a sort of
vehemence in the cyes; it will be less in the head
than in the arms. All these movements are made,
but the body remains firm. Generally the reverse
takes place; the whole body is moved; but this is
wrong.
In these words: “Where are they, these wretch-
cs?" there must be great violence in the upper
part of the body, but the step is very calm.
To affect a violent gait is an awkward habit.
A modified slowness in the small agents crcates
emphasis ; if we give them too great facility of
movement, the gestures bccomc mcan and wretched.
Rhythm is in marvelous accord with naturc under
the impulse of God.
Importance of the Laws of Gesturc.
We never really understand an author's meaning.
Every one is free to interpret him according to his
individual instinct. But we must know how to jus-
tify his interpretation by gesture. Principles must
aid us in choosing a point of view in accordance
with his individual nature; otherwise incoherence is
inevitable. Hence rules are indispensable. But
when the law is known, each applies it in accordance
with his own idea.
The author himself cannot read without rules, in

GESTURE.
such a manner as to convey the ideas he intended to
express. Only through rules can we become frcc in
our interpretation; we are not free without law, for
in this case we are subject to the caprice of some
master.
The student of oratory should not be a servile
copyist. In the arrangement of his effects, he must
copy, imitate and compose. Let him first reproduce
a fixed model, the lesson of the master. This is to
copy. Let him then reproduce the lesson in the
absence of the master. This is to imitate. Finally,
let him reproduce a fugitive model. This is to com-
Pose.
Thus to reproduce a lesson, to give its analysis
and synthesis, is to disjoint, to unite and to reunite;
this is the progressive order of work.
The copying and imitative exercises should be
followed by compositions, applying the principles
already known. The orator may be allowed play
for his peculiar genius; he may be sublime even in
employing some foolish trick of his art. But what-
ever he does, he must be guided by fixed rules.

CHAPTER V.
OF GESTURE IN PARTICULAR.
The Head.
The dynamic apparatus is composed of the head,
the torso and the limbs. As in the vocal apparatus,
we have the lever, the impelling force, and the ful-
crum.
The dynamic apparatus produccs gesture, which
renders the moral or normal state; as the voice
expresses inflection and reveals the sensitive statc.
The head must be studied under two relations:
as the agent of expression through its movements,
and as the centre of attraction; that is, the point of
departure or arrival for the different gestures of the
arm.
Let us now apply ourselves to the signification of
the movements of the head and eyes, the face and
lips.
Thc Movements of the Head.
There are two sorts of movements of the head:
movements of attitude and fugitive movements.
Movements of Attitude.—The head has nine pri-
mary attitudes, from which many others proceed.
In the normal attitude, the head is neither high
nor low.
In the concentric attitude the head is lowered;
this is the reflective state.
5


## p. 66 (#121) #############################################

66
GESTURE.
In the ccccntric attitude the head is clevated ;
this is the vital state.
Soldiers and men of robust physique carry the
head high.
Here are three genera, each of which gives three
species.
Thc Normal State.
When the hcad is crcct, it is passive and neutral.
The licad inclining laterally toward the interlocu-
tor indicates affcction.
If in the inverse direction, opposite the interlocu-
tor, sensualism is indicated. This is in fact retroac-
tion; in the first case we love the soul, in the latter
the form.
The Eccentric State.
If the head bends backward it is the passional or
vchcmcnt statc.
The head inclined toward the interlocutor, denotes
abandon, confidence.
The head turned away from the interlocutor, de-
notcs pride, noblc or basc. This is a neutral
expression which says something, but not the
whole.
The Concentric Stato.
The head lowered, that is, inclined forward, de-
notes the reflective state.
If the head inclines toward the interlocutor, it is
veneration, an act of faith in the object we love.


## p. 67 (#122) #############################################

MOVEMENTS OF THE ITEAD,
67
If the head inclines away from the interlocutor,
it is stratagem or suspicion.
All other attitucles or the head arc modifications
of these. These nine attitudes characterize states,
thai is, sentiments, but sentiments which are fugi-
tive. Either of these attitudes may be affected
until it becomes habitual. But there are movements
which cannot be habitually affected, which can only
modify types and attitudes of the inflections of the
head. These are fugitive movements.
There are ninc inflcctions or ſugitive movements
of the licad :-
1. If a forward movement, it ends in an upright
onc, with clevated chin, and indicates interrogation,
hope, appellation, desire.
2. The same movement with the chin lowered,
indicates doubt, resignation.
3. A nod of the head, a forward movement,
mcans confirmation, yes, or well.
4. If the movement is brusque forward, it is the
menace of a resolute man.
5. The head thrown back mcans exaltation.
6. If the movement is brusque backward, it is the
menace of a wcak man.
7. There arc rotative infcctions from one shoul-
der to the other; this is impaticnce, rcgrct.
8. The rotary movement of the head alonc signi-
fies negation, that is no.
If the movement ends toward the interlocutor, it
is simple ncgation.


## p. 68 (#123) #############################################

68
GESTURE.
If the movement ends opposite to him, it is nega-
tion with distrust.
9. The rotative and forward inficction would de-
notc cxaltation.
The sense of this response,—"I do not know,"
when tidings of a friend are asked, may be divined
by an infcction of the head.
It is well to note how these movements are trans-
mitted from agent to agent.
All movements which severally affect the head,
the hand, the body and the leg, may affcct the whole.
Thus the movement of negation is made by the
hand. This movement is double. There is nega-
tion with direct resolution, and negation with inverse
resolution, which is elliptical. The hand recoils as
the head recoils, and when the head makes the
movement of impaticnce, the hand riscs with the
head and says:-“ Leave me alone, I do not wish
to hear you."
It is curious to see an inficction pass successively
from the head to the hand, from the hand to the
cye, from the cye to the shoulders, from the shoul-
ders to the arms, from the arms to the logs, from
the legs to the ſect.
For example: Above we have indicated a double
menace made by the head. One might transfer this
menace to the hand and say: "You will have a
quarrel to settle with mc !"
Each agent has its rôle, and this is why they
transmit their movements.


## p. 69 (#124) #############################################

MOVEMENTS OF TIIE JIEAD,
69
When the head has a serious part to play, it con-
municates an inficctive movement to the hand, which
renders it tcrrible.
A man who menaces with the head is not sure
of his aim, but he who menaces with the hand is
sure of striking right. In order to do this, the eye
must be firmly fixed, as the cye necessarily loses
its power and accuracy by a movement of the
head.
There is great power in the menace communica-
ted to the hand, a power not found in the other
movement. The head-menace is more physical,
and the hand-menace more intellectual; in the one
the eye says a great deal, while in the other it says
nothing:
The orator cannot always make these gestures
with facility. The menace may be elliptical. Then
it must be made by the head, and expressed through
the cycs. This is why the speaker gazes downward
as he makes it.
It is the same downward or upward movement
which is reproduced when the menace is concentric
or clliptical.
The menacc may be made in yet another way.
The speaker does not wish to cxpress his opinion,
and for fear of compromising himself with his cyes,
hic docs not gaze at his interlocutor; he turns aside
his glance, and the menace is communicated to the
shoulder. This has less strength, because it is ren-
dered by one of the sensitive agents.


## p. 70 (#125) #############################################

70
GESTURE
The man who threatens with the shoulder is more
passionate; but he is not the agent, he is passive.
A simple menace may be made by the knce.
The foot is susceptible of great mobility. A slight
movement quickly changes its significance; in pass-
ing from one agent to another, it is modified by
many ellipscs.

rôle of the agent set in motion, while inflection is
universal.
The head alonc expresses trouble, dejection.
Dejection is in the head, as firmness is in the
reins and cxaltation in the shoulders.
All the movements of the head are communicated
to all the active organs. The head is always in
opposition to the arms. The head must be turned
away from the leg which is advanced.
Men of small brain habitually carry their heads
high. The head is lowered in proportion to the
quantity of intelligence.
Examine the criterion for the fixed attitudes of
the head.
Of the Eyes.
The eye, in common with all the other agents, has
nine primary expressions, three genera and nine
species.
The cye contains three agents: The optic or
visual, the palpebral or pupil, and the eyebrow
agent. Each of these has its peculiar sense, and
we shall show how they are united.
The optic agent has three direct or convergent
glances. The cyes converge toward the object they
examinc, at such a point that if the object were
there they would squint. A skilled observer can
determine the distance of the object, upon secing
the two eyes.
There is a revolving or divergent glance. If


## p. 72 (#127) #############################################

GESTURE.
both eyes project in parallel lines, they scc double.
A drunken man sees double because the eyes do
not converge.
Between these two glances there is the ecstatic or
parallel vision; but the object is not so far away
that its distance may not be determined. The con-
vergencc is not appreciable. This is the dreamy
expression. We shall here treat of one only, to
which we refer the three others. Let us take the
direct glance, passing by the optic agent, since it is
direct in all the phenomena we have to consider.
There are threc phenomena in the eyebrow :
cccentric, concentric and normal. From these we
derive nine terms. If the cye is normal, it is a pas-
sive expression which determincs nothing. If, with
the same eye, the cyebrow is cccentric, there is a
difference; one part of us tends vehemently toward
something, and the other says: “It is not worth the
trouble.” The sensitive part aspires, while the in-
tellect says, “This amounts to nothing."
The concentric eyebrow indicates a mind discon-
certed by fatigue or ennui, a contention of one part
of the nature with the other, which resists, and says:
“I do not wish to be troubled about this; it wearics
mc."
The normal brow and the eccentric eye indicate
stupor.
Here there is again contrariety. One part of the
being ardently aspires toward some object, while the
other is powerless to aid it.


## p. 73 (#128) #############################################

OF THE EYES.
73
The cyc is purely an intellectual agent, dcnoting
the various states of the mind.
The cccentric cye and the clevated eyebrow dc-
note vclcmcncc. This is an active state that will
become astonishment. Many phenomena will arise
.
and be subordinate to this movement; but it is
vehemence par excellence; it is aspiration.
If the brow lowers vehcmcntly with the cyes
open, it is not rage, but a state of mind independent
,
of everything the senses or the heart can say.
This is firmness of mind, a state of the will indc-
pendent of every outside influence. It may be
attention, or anger, or many other things.
If the eye is concentric and the cyebrow in the
normal state, it is slumber, fatiguc.
If the eyebrow is eccentric and the eye concen-
tric, it will represent not indifference only, but
scorn, and after saying, “This thing is worthless,"
will add, “I protest against it, I close my eyes."
If both the cyc and eyebrow are concentric,
there is contention of mind. This is a mind which
seeks but does not possess.
This explanation may be rendered more clear and
casier to retain in mind by the following resumé:
Concentric. Contention of mind.

The nine expressions of the cye correspond to
each of the nine movements of the head. Thus the
cye may give nine types of affection, nine of pride,
ninc of sensualism, etc. This gives eighty-one ex-
pressions of the eye. Hence, knowing cighteen
elements, we inevitably possess eighty-one.
The nine expressions of the eye may be verificd
by the criterion.
As a model, we give the nine expressions of the

there may be an inclination either way. The top
of the cyebrow may be lifted.
Thus in the concentric state, three types may be
noted, and these go to make twenty-seven primary
movements. The lower cyclid may be contracted;
the twenty-scven first movements may be examined
with this, which makes 2 X 27.
A movement of the check may contract the eye
in an opposite direction, and this contraction may
be total, which makes eighty-one expressions be-
longing to the normal glance alone.
This direct glance may also be direct on the infe-
rior plane, which makes 2 X 81; for these are dis-
tinct expressions which cannot be confounded.
This movement could again be an upward one,
which would make 3 X 81.
The movement may be outward and superior, or
it may be simply outward; it may also be outward
and inferior. A special sense is attached to cach
of these movements,-a sense which cannot be con-
founded with any of the preceding movements.
By making the same computation for the three
glances above noted, we shall have from eight to
nine hundred movements.
All this may appear complicated, but with the key
of the primary movements, nothing can be more
simple than this deduction.
The above chart with its exposition of the phases
of the eye explains everything. A small eye is a
sign of strength; a large eye is a sign of languor.

## p. 77 (#132) #############################################

OF THE EYEBROWS.
77
A small oblique eye (the Chinese eye), when asso-
ciated with lateral development of the cranium,
and ears drawn back, indicates a predisposition to
murder.
The eye opens only in the first emotion ; then it
becomes calm, closing gradually; an eye wide open
in emotion, denotes stupidity.
:
Of the Eyebrows.
There are threc thermometers: the cycbrow is
the thermometer of the mind; the shoulder is the
thermometer of the life; the thumb is the ther-
mometer of the will.
There is parallelism between the eye and the
voice. The voice lowered and the brow lifted,
indicate a desire to create surprise, and a lack of
mental depth.
It is very important to establish this parallelism
between the movements of the brow and voice.
The lowered brow signifies retention, repulsion:
it is the signification of a closed door. The eleva-
ted brow means the open door. The mind opens
to let in the light or to allow it to escape. The
eyebrow is nothing less than the door of intelli-
gence. In falling, the voice repels. The efforts in
repulsion and retention are equal.
The inflections are in accord with the eyebrows.
When the brows are raised, the voice is raised.
This is the normal movement of the voice in rela-
tion to the eyebrow.

Sometimes the eyebrow is in contradiction to the
movement of the voice. Then there is always
ellipse; it is a thought unexpressed. The contra-
diction between these two agents always proves
that we must seck in the words which these phe-
nomena modify, something other than they seem to
say. For instance, when we reply to a story just
told us, with this exclamation : "Indecit!"
Ir the brow and voice are lowered, the case is
grave and demands much consideration.
If brow and voice are clevated, the expression is
u ually mild, amiable and affectionatc.
If the voice is raised and the brow lowered, the
form is doubtful and suspicious. With the brow
concentric, the hand is rcpcllcnt.
Both brow and hand concentric denote repulsion
or retention; this is always the case with a dvor.
Both brow and hand eccentric mcan inspiration,
or allowing departure without concern.
There is homogeneity between the face, the cyc-
brow and the hand.
The degree and nature of the emotion must be
shown in the face, otherwise there will be only
grimace.
The hand is simply another expression of the
face. The face gives the hand its significance.
Hand movements without facial expression would
be purely automatic. The face has the first word,
the hand completes the sense. There are cighty-
onc movements of the hand impossible to the face;


## p. 79 (#134) #############################################

OF THE FACE.
79
hence, without the hand, the face cannot express
everything. The hand is the detailed explanation
of what the face has sought to say.
There are expressions of the hand consonant with
the facial traits, and others dissonant: this is the
bcautiful.
The weak hand and the strong face are the sign
of impotence.
The wcak hand and the strong face are the sign
of perfidy.
Thc tones of the voice vary according to the ex-
pression of the face. The face must spcak, it must
have charm.
In laughing, the face is cccentric; a sombre face
is concentric.
The face is the mirror of the soul because it is
the most impressionablc agent, and consequently
the most faithful in rendering the impressions of the
soul.
Not only may momentary emotions be read in
the expression of the features, but by an inspection
of the conformation of the face, the aptitude,
thoughts, character and individual temperament
may be determined.
The difference in faces comes from difference in
the configuration of profiles.
There are three primitive and characteristic pro-
files, of which all others are only derivations or
shades. There is the upright, the concave and the
convex profile. Each of these genera must pro-

duce three species, and this gives again the accord
of nine.
These different species arise from the direction
of the angles, as also from the position of the lips
and nose.
Uprightness responds to the perpendicular pro-
file; chastity, to the concave; sensualism, to the
convex.
Let it be understood that we derogate in no way
from the liberty of the man who remains always
master of his will, his emotions and his inclinations.
A criterion of the face is indispensable to the
intelligent physiognomist, and as the lips and nose
have much to do with the expression of the face,
we offer an unerring diagnosis in the three following
charts:

CHAPTER VI.
OF TIE TORSO.
The torso includes the chest, and shares the
shoulder movements with the arms.
The Chost.—There are three chcst attitudes, eccen-
tric, concentric and normal.
1. If the chest is greatly dilated, this is the
ccccntric state -- the military attitude, the sign of
cnersy
2. The normal, when the chest is in a state more
homogeneous, less contentious, more sympathetic,
as in the statue of Antinous.
3. The concentric, when the chest is hollow, with
the shoulders elevated and inclining forward.
The convcx cccentric chcst is the sign of the
agent, or of him who gives.
The convex concentric chest or the pathetic, is
the sign of the sufferer, or of him who receives.
The chest drawn in with the shoulders elevated,
is the expression of the sublime.
From these three positions, the eccentric, the con-
centric and the normal, are derived nine degrees or
species. Thus in cach of these genera, the torso is
inclined toward the speaker, or away from him,
hence we have three times three, or nine, or the
triple accord.

or cold-
ncss.
The chest need not be lowered; it is here that all
the energy concentrates.
The Shoulders. Every sensitive, agrecable or
painful form is expressed by an elevation of the
shoulders. The shoulders are the thermometer of
the sensitive and passional life. If a man's shoul-
ders are raised very decidedly, we may know tha:
he is decidedly impressed.
The head tells us whether this impression is joy.
ous or sorrowful. Then the species belongs to the
head, and the genus to the shoulder.
If the shoulder indicates thirty degrees, the
hcad must say whether it is warmth
The face will specify the nature of the sor.
row or joy whose value the shoulders have deter-
mined.
The shoulder is one of the great powers of the
orator.
By a simple movement of the shoulder, he can
makc infinitely more impression than with all the
outward gestures which are almost always thcatrical,
and not of a convincing sort.
The shoulder, we have said, is the thermometer
of emotion and of love. The movement is neutral
and suited to joy as well as to sorrow; the eyes
and mouth are present to specify it.
The shoulder, like all the agents, has three and
hence nine distinct phases.
The torso is divided into three parts: the thoracic,
the epigastric and abdominal.


## p. 86 (#141) #############################################

We shall state farther on, the role of these three
important centres.
Liars do not elevate their shoulders to the re-
quired degree, hence the truth or falsity of a senti-
ment may be known.
Raphael has forgotten this principle in his
" Moses Smiting the Rock.” None of his figures,
although joyous, elevate the shoulder.

CHAPTER VII.
OF TIIE LIMBS.
The limbs hold an important place in oratorical
action.
The study of the rule of the arms and limbs
therefore deserves serious attention,
The Arms.
In the arms we distinguish the deltoid or shoulder
movement, the inflection of the fore-arm, the elbow,
the wrist, the hand and the fingers.
Inflections of the Forc-Arm.
We have treated of what concerns the shoulder
in the chapter upon the torso.
The arm has three movements: an upward and
downward vertical movement, and a horizontal
onc.
Thcsc movements derive their significance from
thic different angles formed by the forc-arm in
relation to the arm. Let us first represent these
different angles, and then we will explain the
chart.

In laughing, the face is eccentric; a sombre face
is concentric.
The face is the mirror of the soul because it is
the most impressionable agent, and consequently
the most faithful in rendering the impressions of the
soul.
Not only may momentary emotions bc read in
the expression of the features, but by an inspection
of the conformation of the face, the aptitude,
thoughts, character and individual temperament
may be determined.
The difference in faces comes from difference in
the configuration of profiles.
There are three primitive and characteristic pro-
files, of which all others are only derivations or
shades. There is the upright, the concave and the
convex profile. Each of these genera must pro-

duce three species, and this gives again the accord
of nine.
These different species arise from the direction
of the angles, as also from the position of the lips
and nose.
Uprightness responds to the perpendicular pro-
file; chastity, to the concave; sensualism, to the
convex.
Let it be understood that we derogate in no way
from the liberty of the man who remains always
master of his will, his cniotions and his inclinations.
A criterion of the facc is indispensable to the
intelligent physiognomist, and as the lips and nose
have much to do with the expression of the face,
we offer an unerring diagnosis in the three following
charts:

CHAPTER VI.
OF TIIE TORSO.
The torso includes the chest, and shares the
shoulder movements with the arms.
The Chost.—There are three chest attitudes, eccen-
tric, concentric and normal.
1. If the chest is greatly dilated, this is the
ccccntric state — the military attitude, the sign of
cnergy
2. The normal, when the chest is in a state more
homogeneous, less contentious, more sympathetic,
as in the statue of Antinous.
3. The concentric, when the chest is hollow, with
the shoulders elevated and inclining forward.
Thc convcx ccccntric chest is the sign of the
agent, or of him who gives.
The convex concentric chest or the pathetic, is
the sign of the sufferer, or of him who reccives.
The chest drawn in with the shoulders elevated,
is the expression of the sublime.
From these three positions, the eccentric, the con-
centric and the normal, arc derived nine degrees or
species. Thus in cach of these genera, the torso is
inclined toward the speaker, or away from him,
hence we have three times three, or nine, or the
triple accord.

Tie chest nccd not be lowered; it is here that all
the energy concentrates.
The Shoulders.- Every sensitive, agrecable or
painful form is expressed by an elevation of the
shoulders. The shoulders are the thermometer of
the sensitive and passional life. If a man's shoul-
ders are raised very decidedly, we may know tha:
he is decidedly impressed.
The head tells us whether this impression is joy.
ous or sorrowful. Then thic species belongs to the
head, and the genus to the shoulder.
If the shoulder indicates thirty degrees, the
hcad must say whether it is warmth
ncss. The face will specify the nature of the sor-
row or joy whose value the shoulders have deter-
mined.
The shoulder is one of the great powers of the
orator.
By a simple movement of the shoulder, he can
make infinitely more impression than with all the
outward gestures which are almost always theatrical,
and not of a convincing sort.
The shoulder, we have said, is the thermometer
of emotion and of love. The movement is neutral
and suited to joy as well as to sorrow; the eyes
and mouth are present to specify it.
The shoulder, like all the agents, has three and
hence nine distinct phases.
The torso is divided into three parts: the thoracic,
the epigastric and abdominal.


## p. 88 (#151) #############################################

GESTURE
We shall state farther on, the role of these three
important centres.
Liars do not elevate their shoulders to the re-
quired degree, hence the truth or falsity of a senti-
ment may be known.
Raphael has forgotten this principle in his
"Moses Smiting the Rock." None of his figures,
although joyous, elevate the shoulder.


## p. 88 (#152) #############################################

CHAPTER VII.
OF TIIE LIMBS.
The limbs hold an important place in oratorical
action.
The study of the role of the arms and limbs
therefore deserves serious attention,
The Arms.
i
In the arms we distinguish the deltoid or shoulder
movement, the inficction of the fore-arm, the elbow,
the wrist, the hand and the fingers.
Inflections of the Fore-Arm.
We have treated of what concerns the shoulder
in the chapter upon the torso.
The arm has three movements: an upward and
downward vertical movement, and a horizontal
onc.
These movements derive their significance from
the different angles formed by the fore-arm in
relation to the arm. Let us first represent these
different angles, and then we will explain the
chart.

All these different angles have their meaning,

The movement at the right angle signifies: To be.
Lower: Perhaps.
Lower still: I doubt if it is so.
Lower: It is improbablc.
Lower: It is not.
Lower : It is not possible.
Ascending: This is proven, I have the proof in

Higher: This is superlatively beautiful.
Higher : It is enchantingly beautiful.

with the angle which the fore-arm forms with the
arm.
All these modes of affirmation may be applied to
negation. For example:
“ It is impossible that this should not be. This
cannot be."
Thus all states of being, all forms of affirmation,
belong to the acuteness or opening of an angle.
The hanging arm significs depression. The two
arms should never extend the same way. If they
follow each other, one should be more advanced
than the other. Never allow parallclism. The elc-
mentary gestures of the arms are represented in the
foregoing chart.
of the Elbow.
Thc clbow has nine movements, three primitive,
as genera, and ninc derivativc, as spccics. There are
the forward and backward movements of the normal
state. There are three degrees of height, and finally
the forward and backward movcmcnts of cxtcnsion.
The elbow movements are relational. The epi-
condyle is called the cyc of the arm.
Man slightly moves thc torso, then the shoulder,
and finally the elbow.
Among persons who would fain crush others,
there is an elbow movement which seems to say, “I
annihilate thee, I am above thce."
The elbow turned outward signifies strength, pow-
er, audacity, domination, arrogance, abruptness,

!
activity, abundance. The elbow drawn inward,
signifies impotence, fear, subordination, humility,
passiveness, poverty of spirit.
Modest people have a slight outward movement
of the elbow. The humble make an inward move-
ment. The elbow thrust forward or backward, indi-
cates a yielding character.
These movements should not be taken alone;
they must be verificd by the torso and the head.
The shoulder characterizes the expression of the
elbow movements, just as the clbow verifies marked
exaltation, by the clevation of the shoulder.
It is by thcsc little things that we determine mil-
lions of movements and their meaning. We finally
dctcrminc and class precisely five million move-
ments of the different agents of the arm. This
would seem enormous; but it is nothing at all; it
is childlike simplicity. The clements being known,
the process is always the same. Hence the advan-
tage of possessing a criterion. With this criterion.
we have everything. If we possess nine, we possess
twenty millions, which are no more than nine.
of the IVrist.
The wrist is a directing instrument for the fore-
arm and the hand.
The wrist has its three movements.
It is eccentric when the extensor muscles are in
motion.
It is normal in the horizontal position.


## p. 91 (#156) #############################################

OF TIIE IIANI).
91
It is concentric when the Alexor muscles are in
action.
In the concentric position the wrist is in prona-
tion, for the thumb is turned downward; this is the
sign of a powerful will, because the pronator muscles
have more power than the Acxors.
In the eccentric position the wrist is in supination;
that is, the back of the hand is downward ; this is
the sign of impotence.
The wrist has also forward and backward move-
monts, either in pronation, in supination, or the nor-
mal state. Thus there are nine phascs for the wrist.
It is through the aid of the wrist that the aspects
of the hand, placed upon the cube, receive, as we
shall scc, their preciso signification.
The orator needs great supplcncss in wrist move-
ments to give grace to the phases of the hand.
Of the Hand.
Man is perforce painter, poet, inspired dreamer
or mystic, and scientist.
He is a painter, to reveal the phenomena of the
sensitive life; a poct, to admire the mysteries of
grace; a scientist, to make known the conceptions
of the mind. Thus the hand has threc presenta-
tions, neither more nor less, to render that which
passes in man in the sensitive, moral or intellectual
state.
Let us now examine the three presentations of an
open hand: its palmar, dorsal and digital aspect.


## p. 92 (#157) #############################################

92
GESTURE.
The same thing may be expressed by these three
presentations, but with shades of difference in the.
meaning
If we say that a thing is admirable, with the
palms upward, it is to describe it perfectly. This is
the demonstrative aspect.
If we say the same thing, displaying the back of
the hand, it is with the sentiment of impotence.
We have an idea of the thing, but it is so bcautiful
we cannot express it. This is the mystic aspect.
If we present the digital extremity, it is as if we
said: "I have seen, I have weighed, I have num-
bered the thing, I understand it from certain knowl-
edge; it is admirable, and I declare it so." These
are the three aspects: the palmar, dorsal and dig-
ital.
Each of these attitudes of the hand may be pre-
sented under three forms: the eccentric, normal and
concentric.
Each of these forms as genera, produces three
species; this gives the hand nine intrinsic attitudes,
whose neutral signification will be specificd and de-
termined by the presentation of the hand upon the
cube.
Let us first take the normal state as genus, and
we shall have the normal hand as species in the
normal genus. This will then be the normo-normal
attitude.
By presenting the hand in pronation or supination
horizontally, without spreading or folding the fine

93
gers, we shall have that attitude which signifies
abandon.
Let us now take the eccentric species, still in the
normal genus.
Raise the hand somewhat with a slight parting of
the fingers, and we have the eccentro-normal hand,
which signifies expansion.
Finally, let us consider the concentric species, still
in the normal statc.
Present the hand lifeless and you have the con-
centro-normal attitude, which signifies prostration.
Let us pass on to the concentric genus.
By closing the fingers with the thumb inward
upon the middle one, we shall have the normo-con-
centric hand, which signifies the tonic or power.
To close the hand and place the thumb outside
upon the index finger, signifies confict. This is the
concentro-concentric hand.
To bend the first joint with the fingers somewhat
apart, indicates the eccentro-concentric hand. This
is the convulsive state.
Let us pass on to the eccentric genus.
The fingers somewhat spread, denote the normo-
eccentric hand. This is exaltation.
To spread the fingers and fold them to the
second joint, indicates the concentro-concentric
hand. This is retraction,
To spread the fingers as much as possible, gives
the eccentro-eccentric hand. This is exasperation.
In the subjoined charts we can sce an illustration
of the different attitudes of the hand.

GESTURE.
By this presentation the nine movements of the
hand correspond with the expressive movements of
the arm.
Take any cube whatever,-- a book, a snuff-box,
or rather cast your eyes upon the foregoing chart,
and examine it carefully.
There are three directions in the cube: horizon-
tal, vertical and transverse. Hence there are six
faces, anterior, superior, inferior, interno-lateral and
externo-lateral.
Of what use are angles and faces? All this is
necessary for those who would know the reason
of the sentiments expressed by the hand. There
are twenty-seven sorts of affirmation. We give nine
of them with the six faces of the cube.
The Digital Face.
To place the hand, whether cccentric, concentric
or normal, upon the upper face of the cube, is to
hold, to protect, to control; it is to say: "I hold
this under my protection."
To place the hand upon the external side-face of
the cubc, significs to belong; it says: "All this be-
longs to me." It is the affirmation of the man who
knows, who has had the thing in dispute under his
own eyes, who has measured it, examined it in all
its aspects. It is the affirmation of the connoisscur.
To apply the hand to the inner side of the face is
to let go. Here is the sense of this affirmation:
“You may say whatever you will, but I affirm in

spite of every observation, in spite of all objection;
I affirm whether or no."
The Back Facc.
There are three ways of touching the front face
of the cube with the hand.
A.-To touch it with the end of the fingers up-
ward and the thumb inward, is to obtain: “I have
obtained great benefits, I do not know how to ex-
press my gratitude." Or rather: “I keep the
object for myself; I do not care to let it be seen."
This is the mystic face. Or yet again: "I contem-
plate."
B.---To place the hand horizontally on the same
face of the cube, is to restrain, or bound.
farther, if you please; all this belongs to me."
C.-To place the hand upon the same anterior
face of the cube, but with the extremities of the
fingers vertically downward, means to retain. It
says: “I rescrve this for myself." Here, then,
are three aspects for the anterior face of the cube.
“Go no
The Palmar Facc.
A.-To place the lower face of the cube in the
hand, is to sustain. It is to say: "I will sustain
you in misfortune."
B.-To apply as much as possible the palm upon
the same posterior face of the cube, with the fingers
downward, is to maintain: "I maintain what I have
said."
C.-To apply the hand upon the same face with

the extremitics of the fingers upward, is to con-
tain, is to show the object - it is to disclosc: I
affirm; you cannot doubt mc; I open my heart;
behold me!"
There arc, then, ninc affirmations, which arc cx-
plained by a more vicw of the cube and its faces.
The twelve edges of the cube give a double affir-
mation; the angles, a triplc affirmation. Example
for the edges: To place the hand on the back edge,
means: "I protect and I demonstrate."
There are three movements or infcctions of the
hand which must be pointed out: to hover, to insin-
uate, to envelop.
The thrcc rhythmic actions of the hand must not
be passed over in silence: to inclinc, to fall, to be
precipitated.
The aspects of the hands would be simply tclc-
graphic movements, were it not for the inflections
of the voice, and, above all, the expression of the
eyes. The expressions of the hand correspond to
the voice. The hands are the last thing demanded
in a gesture; but they must not remain motionless,
as (if they were stiff, for instance) they might say
more than was necessary.
The hands are clasped in adoration, for it seems
as if we held the thing we love, that we desire.
The rubbing of the hands denotes joy, or an
eager thirst for action; in the absence of anything
else to caress, we take the hand, we communicate
our joy to it.


## p. 99 (#164) #############################################

OF THE FINGERS.
99
There is a difference between the caress and the
rubbing of the hands.
In the carcss, thic hand cxtcnds cagerly, and
passes lightly, undulatingly, for fear of harming.
There is an elevation of the shoulders.
The hand is an additional expression of the face.
The movement must begin with the face, the hand
only completes and interprets the facial expression.
The head and hand cannot act simultancously to
express the same sentiment. One could not say no
with hcad and hands at the same time. The head
commands and proccdes the movement of the hand.
The cycs, and not the head, may be parallel with
the hand and the other agents,
The hand with its palm upward may be caressing,
if there is an elevation of the eyebrow; repellent
with the eyebrow concentric.
The waving hand may have much scnse, accord-
ing to the expression of the face.
The cye is the essential agent, the hand is only
the reverberatory agent; hence it must show less
energy than the eye.
Of thc Fingers.
Each finger has its separatc function, but it is
exclusive of the great expressions which constituto
the accords of nine. These are interesting facts,
but they do not spring naturally from the fountain
of gesture. They are more intellectual than moral.


## p. 100 (#165) ############################################

GESTURE.
In a synthetic action all the fingers converge. A
very energetic will is expressed by the clenched fist.
In dealing with a fact in detail, as we say:
“Rcmark this well,” all the fingers open to bid us
concern ourselves only with the part in dispute.
This is analysis; it is not moral, it is intellectual.
If we speak of condensation we close the hand.
If we have to do with a granulated object, we test it
with the thumb and index finger.
If it is carneous, we touch it with the thumb and
middle finger.
If the object is fuid, delicate, impressionable, we
express it by the third finger.
If it is pulverized, we touch it with the little
finger.
We change the finger as the body is solid, humid,
delicate, or powdery.
The orator who uses the fingers in gesticulation,
gives proof of great delicacy of mind.
Of the Logs.
The legs have ninc positions which we call base
attitudes.
We shall give a detailed description, summing up
in a chart of the criterion of the legs at the end of
this section.
First Attitude. This consists in the equal balance
of the body upon its two legs. It is that of a child
posed upon its fect, neither of which extends farther
than the other. This attitude is normal, and is the

sign of weakness, of respect; for respect is a sort
of weakness for the person we address. It also
characterizes infancy, decay.
Second Attitude. In this attitude the strong leg is
backward, the free one forward. This is the attitude
of reflection, of concentration, of the strong man.
It indicates the absence of passions, or of concen-
tred passions. It has something of intelligence;

it is neither the position of the child nor of the
uncuitured man. It indicates calmness, strength,
independence, which are signs of intelligence. It is
the concentric state.
Third Attitude.—Here the strong leg is forward,
the free leg backward. This is the type of vehe-
mencc. It is the eccentric attitude.
2
The orator who would appear passive, that is, as
experiencing some cmotion, or submitting to some
action, must have a backward pose as in figure 2.
If, on the contrary, he would communicate to his
audience the expression of his will or of his own
thought, he must have a forward poisc as in figure 3.
Fourth Atitudo.-Here the strong leg is behind,
as in the second attitude, but far more apart from
the other and more infected.
This is very nearly the attitude of the fencing

master, except the position of the foot, which is
straight instead of being turned outward.
This is a sign of the weakness which follows
vchcmcnce.
Natural weakness is portrayed in figure I; sud-
den weakness in figure 4.
Fifth Attitude.—This is necessitated by the incli-
nation of the torso to one side or the other. It is
냈

a third to one side. It is a passive attitude, pre-
paratory to all oblique steps. It is passing or transi-
tive, and ends all the angles formed by walking. It
is in frequent use combined with the second.
Sixth Attitude. This is one-third crossed. It is
an attitude of great respect and ceremony, and is
effective only in the presence of princes.
Seventh Attitude. This is the first position, but
the legs are farther apart. The free limb is turned

OF THE LEGS.

to one side; both limbs are strong. This dcnotes
intoxication, the man overwhelmed with astonish-
ment, familiarity, repose. It is a double fifth.
Eighth Attitude. This is the second, with limbs
farther apart. It is the alternative attitude. The
body faces one of the two legs. It is alternative
from the fact that it ends in the expression of two
60
extreme and opposite sentiments; that is, in the
third or the fourth. It serves for eccentricity with
reticence, for menace and jealousy. It is the type
of hesitation. It is a parade attitude. At the same
time offensive and defensive, its aspect casily im-
presses and leaves the auditor in doubt. What is
going to happen? What sentiment is going to arise
from this attitude which must have its solution
either in the third or fourth?
Ninth Attitude. This is a stiff second attitude,
in which the strong leg and also the free one are

equally rigid. The body in this attitude bends
backward; it is the sign of distrust and scorn.
The legs have one aspect. If, in the second, the
strong leg advances slowly to find the other, it is the
tiger about to leap upon his prey; if, on the con-
trary, the free leg advances softly, the vengeance is
retarded.
The menace made in figure 3, with inclination of
the head and agitation of the index finger, is that
of a valet who wishes to play some ill turn upon his
master; for with the body bent and the arm ad-
vanced, there is no intelligence. But it is ill-suited
to vengeance, because that attitude should be strong
and solid, with the eye making the indication better
than the finger.

CHAPTER VIIL
OF TIIE SEMEIOTIC, OR THE REASON OF GESTURE.
The Types which Characterisc Gosture.
The semeiotic is the science of signs, and hence
the science of the form of gesture. Its objoct is to
give the reason for the forms of gesture according
to the types that characterize it, the apparatus that
modifics it, and the figures that represent it.
There are three sorts of types in man: constitu-
tional or formal, fugitive or passional, and habitual.
The constitutional type is that which we have at
birth.
The passional type is that which is reproduced
under the sway of passion.
The habitual types are those which, frequently
reproduced, come to modify even the bones of the
man, and give him a particular constitution.
Habit is a second naturc, in fact, a habitual
movement fashions the material and physical being
in such a manner as to create a type not inborn,
and which is named habitual.
To recognize constitutional types, we study the
movements of the body, and the profound action
which the habit of these movements exerciscs upon
the body; and, as the type produced by these
movements is in perfect analogy with the formal,


## p. 108 (#175) ############################################

108
GESTURE.
constitutional types, we come through this analogy
to infer constant phenomena from the passional
form. Thus all the formal types are brought back
to the passional types.
Passional types explain habitual types, and thesc
last explain constitutional types. Thus, when we
know the sum of movements possible to an organ,
when we know the sense of it, we arrive at that
semeiotic through which the reason of a form is per-
fectly given.
Of Gesturc Relative to its Modifying Apparatus.
Every gesture places itself in relation with the
subject and the object.
It is rare that a movement tending toward an
object does not touch the double form. Thus, in
saying that a thing is admirable, we start from a
multitude of physical centres whose scnsc wc are to
determinc. When this sense is known, understand-
ing the point of departure, we understand still better
that of arrival.
This division, which is not made at random, is
reproduced in the subjoined diagram.
I represents the vital expression; 2, the intel-
lectual; 3, the moral. We divide the face into
three zones: thc genal, buccal, and frontal.
The expression is physical, moral and intellectual.
In the posterior section of the head we have the

mind holds the temporal region near the forehead
as its inalienablc domicile.
The chest is divided into the thoracic centre for
the mind, into the cpigastric for the soul, and into
the abdominal for the lifc.
The arm is divided into thrcc sections: the del-
toid, brachial and carpal.
This division is a rational one.
Let us suppose
this exclamation: “It is admirablc !" Some say it
starting from the shoulder, others from the chest,
others from the abdominal focus. Thcsc are three
very distinct modes. There is more intelligence
when the movement is from the thoracic centre.
This concerns the honor, the dignity.
When the movement is from the epigastrium, it is

In
moral in a high degrcc. For example: “This is
beautiful! It is admirable! I know not why, but
this gives me plcasure!"
The movement from the abdomen indicates sen-
suality, good nature, and stupidity.
The movement is the same with the hcad.
cmotion it proceeds from the chin; it is the life
movement, it is instinct. That from the cheeks, in-
dicates sentiments, the most noble affections.
Carrying the hand to the forchcad indicates intcl-
ligence. Here we seek relief from embarrassment,
in the other head movements we do not scek it.
The one is a mental, the others are purely physical
efforts. In the latter case one becomes violent and
would fain give blows with his fist.
An infinite number of movements proceed from
these various scats.
We have now reached the scmeiotic standpoint,
that of these very clear plans, the very starting
point of gesture.
The articular centres of the arms are called ther-
mometers: the wrist, that of the organic physical
life; the shoulder, that of the sensitive life; and
the elbow, that of the relative life.
The thumb has much expression; drawn back-
ward it is a symbol of death, drawn forward it is the
sign of life. Where there is abundance of life, the
thumb stands out from the hand. If a friend
promises me a service with the thumb drawn inward,
he deceives. If with the thumb in the normal state,

he is a submissive but not a devoted friend. He
cannot be very much counted upon. If the thumb
stands outward, we may rely upon his promisc.
We still find life, soul and mind in each division
of the body.
Thcre are also a buccal, an occipital and an
abdominal lifc.
The body of man, with all its active and attractive
foci, with all its manifestations, may be considered
an ellipsc.
These well-indicated divisions may be stated in an
analytic formula:
Attractive centres.
LIFE: Occipital.
Mind: Temporal.
Soul.: Pariclal.
Mixt: Frontal.
SOUL: Buccal.
life: Genal.
MIND: Thoracic.
Sovi.: Epigastric.
LIFE: Abdominal.

This is the proper place to fix the definition of
each division by some familiar illustration.

rassed situation. He is a gentleman who has been
overcome by wine. We see him touching the tem-

poral bonc, or the car, as if to seek some expedient:
the strategic mind is there.
Let us begin with the descending gamut, and let
the hand pass over all the divisions of the attractive
centres.
At the occiput: Here is an adventure! I have
really had too strong a dose of them!
At the parietal bone: What a shame!
a
At the temporal bone: What will the people say
of me?
At the forehead: Reason however tells me to
pausc.
At the buccal zone: How shall I dare reappear
before those who have seen me in this state!
At the genal zone : But they did serve such good
winc !
At the breast : Reason long ago advised temper-
ance to me.
At the epigastrium: I have so many regrets
every time I transgress!
At the abdomen: The devil! Gourmandism! I
am a wretched crcature !
The same illustrations may be reproduced in the
rising scale.
When the parictals are touched, the idea and the
sentiment are very clevated. As the foci rise, they
become more exalted.
Let this be considered from another point of view.
We shall reproduce gratitude by touching all the
centres.

They have been centres of attraction, we shall
render them points of departure.
"I thank you!" The more elevated the move-
ments, the more nobility there is in the expression
of the sentiment. The exaltation is proportional
to the section indicated.
The posterior region is very interesting. There
are threc sorts of vertebræ: cervical, dorsal and
lumbar.
This apparatus may first be considered as a lever.
But taking the vertical column alone, we shall have
twenty-four special and distinct keys whose action
and tonality will be entirely specific. From these
twenty-four vertebræ proceed the nervous plcxi, all
aiding a particular expression; so that the vertebral
column forms the keys of the sympathetic human
instrument.
If the finger is cut, there is a special cmotion in
one place of the vertebral column.
If the finger is crushed by the blow of a hammer,
the cmotion will affect a special vertebra.
The nose is one of the most complex and impor-
tant agents.
There are here nine divisions to be studied. (See
page 82.)

CHAPTER IX.
OF GESTURE IN RELATION TO THE FIGURES WHICH
REPRESENT IT.
Gesture through its inflections may reproduce all
the figures of geometry. We shall confine our-
selves to a description of the primary and most
usual imitative inflcctions.
These inflcctions comprise three sorts of move.
ments affected by cach gesturc, which usually unite
and constitute a synthetic form. These three move-
ments agree with the three primary actions which
characterize the manifestations of the soul, the
mind and the life. These are direct, circular and
obliquc inflections.
The Acxor movements are direct, the rotary
movements circular, the abductory movements ob-
liquc. The sum of thcsc movements constitutes
ninc co-essential terms, whose union forms the ac-
cord of ninc.
There are rising, falling and medium inflections.
Gesture does everything that the voice does in.
rising. Hence there is great affinity between the
voice and the arms. Vocal inflcction is like the
gestures of the blind; in fact, with acquaintance,
one may know the nature of the gesture from the
sound of the voice.

TUIE INFLECTIONS OR GESTURE.

We cxalt people by a circle. We say that a thing
is bcautiful, noble, grand-making circles which grow
higher and broader as the object is morc clevated. .
We choose the circle for exalting and caressing,
because the circle is the most agrccable form to
touch and to caress. For example, an ivory ball
This form applies to all that is great.
For God there is no circle, there can be nonc.
But we outline a portion of an immense circle, of
which we can touch but one point. We indicate
only the inner periphery of a circle it is impossible
to finish, and then retrace our steps.
When the circle is made small, we make it with
onc, two, three or four fingers, with the hand, with
the arm. If the circle is vast as can be made
with thic arms, it is homogencous.
But a small circle made with the arm will express
stupidity. Thus we say of a witty man: “ This is a
witty man,” employing the fingers.
Stupidity wishing to simulate this, would make a
broad movement.
Let us take the fablc of Captain Renard as an
example of this view of the circle.
I depict the cunning nature of this captain with
my fingers. Without this he would not be a captain;
but at most a corporal.
-“ He went in company
With his friend Hc-Goat of the branching horns,
The one could see no farther than his nosc;
The other was past master in deccit.”

GESTURE.
As they go along, the fox relates all his exploits
to the goat, and the goat surprised, and wishing an
end of the recital, sees fit to make a gesture, as he
says:
“I admire people full of sense like you."
In making the small circle, he employs not only
the fingers, but the arm, the shoulder, the whole
body. He is an imbecile. He wastes too much
effort in making a small circle.
Let us take a situation from an opera. When,
Robert enters and sees Isabella, he says of her:
• This peaceful slecp, this lull of every sense,
Lends a yet sweeter charm to this young face."
The gesture is in the form of a geometrical
figure.
In another place, Robert says:
“ Thy voice, proud beauty, few can understand.”
Here a spheroidal and then a rectangular move-
ment must be made. We close the door.
“ Her
voice will be understood by me, alone.” He might
say: “Thy voice, proud beauty, will not be under-
stood. It will be elevated for me, and not for
others."
Every sentiment has its form, its plastic expres-
sion, and as its form is more or less elaborated, we
may judge of the elevation of the speaker's thought.
If we could stereotype gesture. we might say:
“ This one has the more clevated heart, that one the

::
least elevated; this one in the matter, that one in
the spirit of his discourse."
All gestures may be very well delineated. An
orator gesticulating before the public, resembles a
painter who pencils outlines and designs upon a
wall.
This reproduction of the figures of gesture is
called Chorography. We give in the subjoined
chart some types of gesture. These are a few
flowers culled from a rich garden.
To express sensual grace the gesture takes the
downward spheroidal 'form. The virtuous form
would be upward.
If we wish to express many attractive things, we
make many spheroidal gesturcs.
What is called the culminating point of the ges-
ture, must not be forgotten. This is a ring in the
form of the last stroke of the German letter D
which is made by a quick, electric movement of the
wrist.
We refer the student to the close of the volume,
for a model of exercises comprising a series of ges-
tures which express the most eloquent sentiments
of the human heart.
This exercise in gesture has two advantages: it
presents all the interest of the most fascinating
drama, and is the best means of gaining suppleness
by accustoming ourselves to the laws of gesture.

CHAPTER I.
ORIGIN AND ORGANIC APPARATUS OF LANGUAGE.
Man reveals his life through more than four mil-
lions of inflections cre he can speak or gesticulate.
When he begins to reason, to make abstractions,
the vocal apparatus and gesture are insufficient; he
must spcak, he must give his thought an outside
form so that it may be appreciated and transmitted
through the scnscs. There are things which can be
expressed neither by sound nor gesture.
For in-
stance, how shall we say at the same time of a
plant: “It is bcautiful, but it has no smell."
Thought must then bc rcvcalcd by conventional
signs, which are articulation. Therefore, God has
cndowed man with the rich gift of speech.
Specch is the sense of the intelligencc; sound the
sense of the life, and gesture that of the heart.
Soul communicates with soul only through the
The senses are the condition of man as a
pilgrim on this carth. Man is obliged to materialize
senscs.

ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
all: the sensations through the voice, the sentiments
through gesture, the ideas through speech. The
mcans of transmission are always material. This is
why the church has sacraments, an exterior worship,
chants, ceremonics. All its institutions arise from a
principle eminently philosophical.
Specch is formed by three agents: thc lips, the
tongue and the soft-palate.
It is delightful to study the special role of these
agents, the reason of their movements.
They have a series of gestures that may be per-
fectly understood. Thus language resembles the
hand, having also its gesture.


## p. 125 (#192) ############################################

CHAPTER II.
ELEMENTS OF ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
Every language is composed of consonants and
vowels. These consonants and vowels are gesturcs.
The value of the consonant is the gesture of the
thing expressed. But as gesture is always the
expression of a moral fact, cach consonant has the
intrinsic character of a movement of the hcart. It
is casy to prove that the consonant is a gesture.
For example, in articulating it, the tonglie rises to
the palate and makes the same movement as the arm
when it would repel somcthing.
The elements of all languages have the same
meaning. The vowels correspond directly to the
moral state,
There is diversity of language because the things
we wish to express vary from difference in usage
and difference of manner and climate. What we
call a shoe, bears among northern people a name
indicating that it protects the feet from the cold;
anong southern people it protects the fect from the
hcat. Elsewhere the shoc protects the fect against
the roughness of the soil; and in yet other places,
it exists only as a defensive object - a weapon.
These diverse interpretations require diverse signs.
This does not prove the diversity of language, but


## p. 126 (#193) ############################################

126
ARTICULATE LANGUAGE
the diversity of the senses affected by the same
objcct.
Things arc perceived only after the fashion of the
perceiver, and this is why the syllables vary among
different peoples.
Nevertheless, there is but one language. We find
cverywhere these words: I an active personality, me
a passive personality, and mine an awarding person-
ality. In every language we find the subject, the
verb and the adjective.
Every articulate language is composed of substan-
tive, adjective and copulative ideas.
All arts are found in articulation. Sound is the
articulation of the vocal apparatus; gesture the
articulation of the dynamic apparatus; language the
articulation of the buccal apparatus. Therefore,
music, the plastic arts and speech have their origin
and their perfection in articulation.
It is, then, of the utmost importance to understand
thoroughly the elements of speech, which is at the
same time a vocalization and a dynamic. Without
this knowledge no oratorical art is possible.
Let us now hasten to take possession of the riches
of specch.


## p. 127 (#194) ############################################

CHAPTER III.
THE ORATORICAL VALUE OF SPEECH.
The privilege of specch may be considered under
a double aspect, in itself and in its relations to the
art of oratory.
1. In Itself:-Specch is the most wonderful gift
of the Creator. Through speech man occupies the
first ránk in the scale of being. It is the language
of the reason, and rcason liſts man above every
crcaturc. Man through speech incarnates his mind
to unite himself with his fellow-men, as the Son of
God was incarnated to unite with human nature;
like the Son of God who nourishes humanity with
his body in the eucharist, so man makes his speech
understood by multitudes who receive it entire,
without division or diminution.
Eternal thanks to God for this incffable gift, so
great in itself, of such value in the art of oratory!
2. What is the oratorical value of speech? In
oratorical art, speech plays a subordinate but indis-
pensable rôle.
Let us examine separately the two members of
this proposition.
A.-In the hicrarchy of oratorical powers, speech
comes only in the third order. In fact, the child


## p. 128 (#195) ############################################

128
ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
begins to utter crics and to gesticulate bcſorc hc
speaks.
The text is only a labcl. The sense lics not in
specch, but in inficction and gesturc. Nature insti-
tutes a movement, speech names the movement.
Writing is a dead letter.
Speech is only the title of that which gesture has
announced; speech comes only to confirm what is
already understood by the auditors.
Wo are moved in reading, not so much by what is
said, as by the manner of reading. It is not what
we hear that affects us, but that which we oursclves
imaginc.
An author cannot fully express his ideas in writ-
ing: hence the interpretation of the hearer is often
false, because he does not know the writer.
It is remarkable, the way in which we refer every-
thing to ourselves. We must needs create a sem-
blance of it. We are affected by a discourse because
we place the personage in a situation our fancy has
created. Hence it happens that we may be wrong
in our interpretation, and that the author might say:
• This is not my meaning."
In hearing a symphony we at once imagine a
scene, we give it an aspect; this is why it affects us.
A written discourse requires many illustrative
cpithets; in a spoken discourse, the adjectives
be replaced by gesture and infection.
Imitation is the melody of the eye, inflection is
the melody of the car. All that strikes the eye has

129
a sound; this is why the sight of the stars produces
an enchanting melody in our souls.
Hence in a discourse, specch is the letter, and it
is inficction and gesture which give it life. Never-
theless :-
B.—The role of speech, although subordinate, is.
not only important, but necessary. In fact, human
language, as we have said, is composed of infection,
gesture and specch.
Language would not be complete without specch.
Specch has nothing to do with sentiment, it is true,
but a discourse is not all sentiment; there is a place
for reason, for demonstration, and upon this ground
gesture has nothing to do; the entire work here falls
back upon specch.
Specch is the crown of oratorical action; it is this
which gives the final elucidation, which justifies ges-
turc. Gesturc has depicted the object, the Being,
and speech responds: God.

CHAPTER IV.
THE VALUE OF WORDS IN PIIRASES.
Expression is very difficult.
One may possess
great knowledge and lack power to express it. Elo-
qucncc docs not always accompany intellect. As a
rule, pocts do not know how to read what they have
written. Hence we may estimate the importance of
understanding the value of the different portions of
a discourse. Let us now examinc intellectual lan-
guage in relation to intensity of idcas.
There are ninc species of words, or nine species
of ideas. The articlc nccd not be counted, since it
is lacking in several languages. It is the accord of
nine which composes the language, and which cor-
responds to the numbers. Every word has a deter-
minate, mathematical value.
As many unities must be reckoned on the initial
consonant as there are values in the word.
Thus the subject has less value than the attribute.
The attribute has a value of six degrees and rep-
resents six times the intensity of the subject. Why?
Because God has willed that we should formulate
our idea with mathematical intensities.
The value rests only upon the initial consonant


## p. 131 (#198) ############################################

VALUE OF WORDS IN MITRASES.
131
of the word. Words have only one expressive por-
tion, that is, the initial consonant. It reccives the
wholc value, and is the invariable part of the word.
It is the root. Words are transformed in passing
from language to language, and nevertheless retain
thcir radical.
How shall we say that a flower is charming?
Do not demand of intensity of sound a value it
docs not possess.
It suffices to await the articula-
tion of the consonant.
The most normal phenomena remain truc to
mechanical laws. The merc articulation of the word
expresses more than all the vocal and imitative
cffects that can be introduced.
Most spcakers dwell upon the final word; this
habit is absolutely opposed to the nature of heart
movements. This school habit is hard to correct,
and if Rachel became a great artistc, it was because
she did not have this precedent.
The subject represents onc degrec; it is the
weakest expression.
The verb represents two degrees; the attribute
six. Let us illustrate the manner of passing from
one to six as follows:
A rustic comes to visit you upon some sort of
business. This man has a purpose. As you are a
musician he is surprised by his first sight of a piano.
He says to himself: "What is this? It is a singular
object."
It is neither a table nor a cupboard. He now


## p. 132 (#199) ############################################

132
ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
pcrccives the ivory keys and other keys of cbony.
What can this mean? He stands confounded before
an instrument entirely new to him. If it were given
to him, he would not know what to do with it: he
might burn it. The piano interests him so much
that he forgets the object of his visit.
He sees you arrive. You occupy for him the place
of the verb in relation to the object which interests
him. He passes from this object to you. Although
you are not the object which engrosses him, there
is a progression in the interest, because he know's
that through you he will learn what this piece of
furniture is. "Tell me what this is !" he cries.
You strike the piano; it gives forth an accord.
O heavens, how beautiful! He is greatly moved, lic
utters many expressions of delight, and now he
would not burn the instrument.
Flere is a progression. At first the piece of fur-
niture interests him; then its owner still more; at
last the attributes of the piano give it its entire
value.
But why six degrees upon the last term? The value
of a fact comes from its limitation; the knowledge
of an idea also proceeds from its limitation. A fact
in its general and vague expression, awakens but
little interest. But as it descends from the genus
to the specics, from the species to the individual, it
grows more interesting. It comes more within our
capacity. We do not embrace the vast circle of a
generic fact.

ination. Is it a rosc or a lily of the valley? The
expression is too vaguc. When the idea of genus
is modified by that of species, we are better satisfied.
Let us say: "The flower of the forest." This
word forcst conveys an idea to the mind. We can
makc our bouquct. We think of the lily of the
valley, of the violct, thc anemonc, thc periwinkle.
This restriction gives value to the subject. Forest is
more important than the verb which does not coni-
plete the idea, and less important than pleasing:
Therefore we placc 3 upon forest, and shall rank
pleasing from 3 to 4, since it closes the assertion.
If we individualize by the word this, we augment
the valuc by giving actuality to the word flower.
This has more value than the forest, because it des-
ignates the subject. Hence this has four degrees.
As pleasing forms the very essence of our prop-
osition, we are obliged to give it five degrees.
The idea is still somewhat vague. If I specify it


## p. 134 (#201) ############################################

134
ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
still further by saying this little floarr, little has a
higher value than all the other words.
What value shall we give this adjective? We have
reached five, but have not yet fully expressed the
idea which impresses us. Little must therefore have
six degrees.
This is the sole law for all the languages of
the world. There are no two ways of articulating
the words of a discourse. When we learn a dis-
course by heart in order to deliver it, and take r.o
account of the value of the terms, the divine law is
rcverscu.
Xow, if we could introduce an expression here,
which would at once enhance the value of the word
pleasing, it would evidently be stronger than all the
others. In fact, iſ the way in which a thing is plcas-
ing can be expressed, it is evident that this manner
of being pleasing will rise above the word itself.
We do not know the proportion in which the
Nower is plcasing. We will say that it is very pleas-
ing. This adverb gives the word pleasing a new
value. It is in turn modified. If we should say
immensely, or use any other adverb of quantity, the
value would remain the same. It would still be a
modification. Thus, when we say of God that he is
good, immensi, infiniti, there is always a limitation
attached to the idea of God.-a limitation necessary
to our nature. For God is not good in the way we
understand goodness or greatness; but our finite
minds need some expression for our idca.


## p. 135 (#202) ############################################

THE CONJUNCTION.
135
We see the word pleasing modified in turn, and
the term which modifics it, is higher than itscif.
Very pleasing,—what value shall we give it? Ilic
can give it no more than seven hcrc.
A single word may obliterate the cffcct produced
by all these expressions. A simple conjunction may
be introduced which will entirely modify all we have
taken pains to say. It is a but. But is an entire
discourse. We no longer bclicve what has been said
hitherto, but what follows this word. This conjunc-
tion has a value of eight degrees, a value possible
to all conjunctions without exception. It sums up
the changes indicated by subsequent cxpressions, and
embraces them synthetically. It has, then, a very
great oratorical value.
The Conjunction.
1. We refer here only to conjunctions in the cllip-
tical sense.
Thic conjunction is an ellipsc, because
it is the middle term between two members of the
sentence which are the extremes; it recalls what has
just been said, and indicates what is to come. Con-
sidered in itself, the word and, when clliptical, cm-
braces what has just been said, and what is about to
bc said. All this is founded upon the principle that
the means are cqual to the cxtrcmcs.
2. The copulative or cnumcrative conjunctions,
have only two degrees. We sce that a conjunction
is not clliptical when, instead of uniting propositions,
it unites only ideas of the same character.

ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
3. Determinative conjunctions have only three
degrees. For example: “It is necessary that I
should work." That has only three degrecs.
4. The values indicated can be changed only by
additional values justificd by gesture. Thus in the
phrasc: "This medley of glory and honor,"—the
valuc of the word meilliy can and must be changed;
but a gesture is necessary, for speech is only a fccble
ccho of gesture. Only gesture can justify a value
other than that indicated in this demonstration.
This value is purely grammatical, but the gesture
may give it a superlative idea, which we call addi-
tional value. The value of consonants may vary in
the pronunciation according to their valuation by
the speakers.
More or less value is given to the degrees noted and
to be noted, as there is more or less emotion in the
speaker. This explains why a gesture, which expresses
an emotion of the soul, justifies changing the gram-
matical value in the pronunciation of consonants.
3. Even aside from additional values, the gesture
must always precede the articulation of the initial
consonant. Otherwise to observe the degree would
be suprcmcly ridiculous. The speaker would re-
scmble a skeleton, a statue. The law of values
becomes vital only through gesture and inflection.
Stripped of the poetry of gesture and inflection, the
application of the law is monstrous.
To place six degrees upon pleasing without ges-
ture, is abominable.


## p. 137 (#204) ############################################

TITE CONJUNCTION,
137
We no:v understand the spirit of gesture, which is
given to man to justify values. It is for him to de
cide whcthcr thc proposition is truc or not. If we
deprive our discourse of gestures, no way is left to
prove the truth of values. Thus gesture is prescribed
by certain figures, and we shall now sce from a prop-
osition, how many gestures are needed, and to what
word the gesture should be given.
The Conjunction Continued - Various Examples.
The degree of value given to the conjunction,
may be represented by the figure 8.
Let us justify this valuation by citing these two
lines of Racinc:
“The wave comes on, it breaks, and vomits
'ncath our cycs,
Amid the foods of foam, a monster
grim and dirc."
The ordinary reader would allow the conjunction
and to pass unperceived, because the word is not
sonorous, and we accord oratorical cffects only to
sonorous words. But the man who sees the mean-
ing
fully, and wlio adds and, has said the whole.
The other words are important, but cverything is
implied in this conjunction.
Racine has not placed and here to disjoin, but to
unite.
We give another cxample of the conjunction:
Augustus says to Cinna:
“Take a chair Cinna, and in all things hecd
Strictly the law that I lay down for thee."

.
Let us suppress the isolation and silence of the
conjunction, a:rd there is no more color.
Augustus adds:
"Hold thy tongue captive, and if silence deep
To thy cmotion do some violence"-
Suppress the silence and isolation of the conjunc-
tion and, and how poor is the expression !
In the fable of "The Wolf and the Dog:"
“Sire wolf would gladly have attacked and slain
him, but it would have been necessary to give battle,
and it was now almost morning."
The entire significance lies in the silence which
follows the conjunctions.
We speak of a sympathetic conjunction, and also
of onc denoting surprise or admiration; but this
conjunction differs from the interjection, only in this
respect: it rests upon the propositions and unites its
termis. Like the interjection, it is of a synthetic and
elliptic nature: it groups all the expressions it unites
as interjectives. It is, then, from this point of vicw,
cxclamativc.
In the fable of "The Wolf and the Lamb," the
wolf says:
• This must be some one of your own racc, for
you would not think of sparing me, you shepherds
and you dogs."
I lere is an interjective conjunction. Suppress the
complaint after for, and there is no more ctrect.
"The conjunction is the soul of the discourse.

TIR INTERJECTION.
139
In the exclamation in “ Joseph Sold by his Breth-
ren,” we again find an interjective conjunction.
“Alas
and
The ingrates who would sell me!
TIere the conjunction and yields little to the inter-
jection alas. It has fully as much value.
Tin listirjiction in Relation to its Digree of f'alue.
The interjection has 9 degrces; this is admirably
suited to the interjection, an elliptical term which
comprises the three terms of a proposition. In
summing up the value of a simple proposition, we
have (a noteworthy thing) the figure 9. This gives
the accord of 9. The subject I, the verb 2, and 6
upon the attribute, equal 9. Thus the equation is
pcrfcct.
Gesture is the rendering of the ellipsc. Gesture
is the elliptical language given to man to express
what specch is powerless to say.
We have spoken of additional figures. Each of
thcsc figures supposes a gesture. There is a gesture,
an imitative expression wherever there is an addi-
tional figure. An ellipse in a word, such as is met
with in the conjunction and the interjcction, demands
a gesturc.
9 is a neutral term which must be sustained by
gesture and inflection. Gesture would be the inflec-
tion of the dcaf, infcction the gesture of the blind.
The orator should, in fact, address himself to the
deaf as well as to the blind. Gesture and inflection

should supplement physical and mental infirmitics,
and God in truth has given man this double means
of expression. There is also a triple expression,
which is double in view of this same modification of
specch. Let us suppose this proposition :
“How much pain I suffer in hearing!"
According to the rules laid down, we have 3 upon
pain, 6 upon suffer, and 6 again upon hicaring.
It is said that Talma brought out the intensity of
his suffering by resting on the word pain. This was
wrong.
We should alway's scck the expression
cquivalent to that employed, to attain a certain
valuc.
If, instead of the determinate conjunction that, we
should have how much (combien), this would evi-
dently be the important word. This word has an
clliptical form. It cvidently belongs to a preceding
proposition. It means: “I could not express all
that I suffer." Then 6 must be placed upon how
much and not upon pain.
But the figure 6 here is a thermometer which indi-
cates a degree of vitality; it does not express the
degree of vitality; that is reserved for gesture. We
need not ask what degree this can give; its office is
to express — and this is a good deal – a value me-
chanical and material, but very significant. A rever-
sion of values may constitute a falschood. Stage
actors are sometimes indefinably comic in this way.

We might bcat tinic for the pronunciation of the

CHAPTER V.
FRENCH AND LATIX PROSODY.
French Prosoutr.
Prosody is the rhythmic pronunciation of syllables
according to accent, respiration, and, above all, quan-
tity.
In the Italian there are no two equal sounds; the
quantity is never uniform. Italian is, therefore, the
most musical of languages. Where we place one
accent upon a vowel, the Italians place ten.
There is a cuphonic law for every language; all
idioms must have an accent. In every language
there are intense sounds and subducd sounds; the
Italians hold to this variety of alternate short and
long sounds. Continuous beauty should be avoided.
A beautiful tone must be introduced to relieve the
others. Monotony in sounds as well as in pronun-
ciation, must be guarded against. Harmony lics in
opposition.
There is but one rule of quantity in French pro-
nunciation. Here is the text of this law:
There are and can be only long initial or final
vowels — whence we conclude:
1. Every final is long and every penultimate is
final, since < mute is not pronounced.


## p. 144 (#211) ############################################

a
2. The length of initial vowels depends upon the
value of the initial consonants which they precedc.
word cannot contain two long vowels unless it
begins with a vowel. In this case, the vowel of the
preceding word is long, and prepares for the cnun-
ciation of the consonant according to its degrcc.
Every first consonant in a word is strong, as it
constitutes the radical or invariable part of the word.
The force of this consonant is subordinate to the
ruling degree of the idea it is called to decide. But
every vowel which precedes this first consonant is
long, since it serves as a preparation for it. But to
what degree of length may this initial vowel be car-
ricd? The representative figure of the consonant
will indicate it.
Usually, the first consonant of every word is rad-
ical. Still there might be other radical consonants
in the same word. But the first would risc above
the others.
The radical designates the substance of being, and
the last consonant the manner.
The whole secret of expression lies in the time
we delay the articulation of the initial consonant. .
This space arrests the attention and prevents our
catching the sound at a disadvantage.
Latin Prosody.
1. The final of a word of several syllables is
usually short.
2. In words of two syllables, the first is long. In


## p. 145 (#212) ############################################

LATIN I'RUSODY.
145
Latin words of two syllables, the first almost alway's
contains the radical.
3. In words of three and more syllables, there is
one long syllable: sometimes the first, sometimes
another. We rest only upon this, all the others
being counted more or less short.
In compound words no account necd be made of
prcfixes. There are many compound words; and,
consequently, it is often the last or next to the last
consonant which is the radical.
The last consonant represents always, in variable
words, quality, person, mode or time. The radical,
on the contrary, represents the sum and substance.
4. Monosyllables are long, but they have, espe-
cially when they follow cach other, particular rules,
which result from the sense of the phrases, and from
the mutual dependence of words.

CHAPTER VII.
A SERIES OF GESTURES FOR EXERCISES.
Preliminary Reflections.
We know the words of Garrick:
"I do not confidc in myself, not I, in that inspira-
tion for which idle mediocrity waits."
Art, then, presents a solid basis to the artist, upon
which he can rest and reproduce at will the history
of the human heart as revcaled by gesture.
This is truc, and it is as an application of this truth
that we are about to consider the series, which is an
exposition of the passions that agitate man, an ini-
tiation into imitative language. It is a poem, and
at the same time it lays down rules through whose
aid the self-possessed artist can regain the gesture
which'arises from sudden perturbation of the heart.
It is a grammar which must be studied incessantly,
in order to understand the origin and valuc of imita-
tive expressions.
The development of the series is based upon the
static, the semeiotic and the dynamic.
The static is the life of gesture; it is the science
of the equipoise of levers, it teaches the weight of
the limbs and the extent of their development, in

order to maintain the cquilibrium of the body. Its
criterion should be a sort of balance.
The scmciotic is the spirit and rationale of ges-
ture. It is the science of signs.
The dynamic is the action of equiponderant forces
through the static; it regulates the proportion of
movements the soul would impress upon the body.
The foundation and criterion of the dynamic, is
the law of the pendulum.
The series proceeds, resting upon these three pow-
crs. The semciotic has given the signs, it becomes
asthetic in applying them. The scmciotic says:
"Such a gesture reveals such a passion;" and ges-
turc replics : “To such a passion I will apply such
a sign." And without awaiting the aid of an inspira-
tion often hazardous, deceitful and uncertain, it
moulds the body to its will, and forces it to repro-
duce the passion the soul has conceived. The sc-
mciotic is a science, the aesthetic an act of genius.
The scrics divides its movements into periods of
time, in accordance with the principle that the more
time a movement has, the more its vitality and power;
and so cvery articulation becomes the object of a
time.
The articulations unfold successively and harnio-
niously. Every articulation which has no action,
must remain absolutely pendent, or become stiff.
Grace is closely united to gesture; the manifold
play of the articulations which constitutes strength,
also constitutes grace. Grace subdues only because

149

sustained by strength, and because strength naturally
subdues. Grace without strength is affectation.
Every vehement movement must affect the verti-
cal position, because obliquity deprives thic move-
ment of force, by taking from it the possibility of
showing the play of the articulations.
The demonstration of movement is in the head.
The head is the primary agent of movement; the
body is the medium agent, the arm the final agent.
Three agents in gesture are especially affected
in characterizing the life, mind and soul. The
thumb is the index-sign of life; the shoulder is the
sign of passion and sentiment; the elbow is the sign
of humility, pride, power, intelligence and sacrifice.
The first gesture of the series is the interpellation,
the entrance upon the scene. The soul is scarcc
moved as yct, and still this is tlic most difficult of
gestures, bccausc thc most complex. It must indi.
cate the nature of the interpellation, its degree and
the situation of the giver and receiver of the sum-
mons in regard to cach other.
A study of the signs which distinguish these dif-
ferent shades will teach us the analysis of gesture.
Aside from simple interpellation, the scrics passes
successively from gratitude, devotion, etc., to anger,
menace and conflict, leaving the soul at the point
where it is subdued and asks forgiveness.
The passional or fugitive type forms the constant
subject of the study of this series.

THE SERIES OF GESTURES APPLIED TO THE SENTI-
MENTS OFTENEST EXPRESSED BY THE ORATOK.
FIRST GESTURE,
Interpellation.
Interpellation embraces five steps :
The first consists in clevating the shoulder in
token of afection. If the right shoulder, as in
figure 2 with the right leg wcak.
The second step consists in a rotary movement of
the arm, its object being to present the epicondyle
(clbow-joint) to the interlocutor. For this reason
the cpicondyle is called the eye of the arm.
The third stage consists in substituting the articu-
lation of the wrist for the cpicondylc. In making
the forward movement of the body, the epicondyle
must resume its natural placc.
The fourth step consists in extending the hand
toward the spcaker in such a way as to present to
him the extremitics of the fingers.
The fifth step is formed by a rapid rotation of the
hand.
SECOND GESTURE.
Thanks - Affectionate and Ceremonious.
This gesture consists of six steps:
1. Consists in lifting the hand and lowering the
head.
2. Consists in raising the hand to the hip.
3. The head inclines to one side, and the clbow

151
at the same time rises to aid the hand in reaching
the lips.
4. In this, the head resumes its normal position,
while the elbow is lowered to bring back the hand
to the same position.
5. In this, the hand passes from the horizontal to
the vertical position, rounding toward the arm.
6. In this, the arm is developed, and then the
hand.
THIRD GESTURE.
Attraction.
In this gesture there are three steps:
1. The hand turns toward the interlocutor with an
appealing aspect.
2. The hand opens like a fan with the little finger
tending toward the chest.
3. The elbow is turned outward, and the hand
passes toward the breast.
FOURTH GESTURE.
Surprise and Assurance.
1. This consists in elevating the shoulders, open-
ing the cyes and mouth and raising the eyebrow;
the whole in token of surprise.
2. Raise the passive hand above the chin, making
it turn around the wrist.
3. The hand still passive, is directed toward the
person addressed, the elbow being pressed against
the body.


## p. 152 (#219) ############################################

152
ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
4. The arm is gradually extended toward the per-
son addressed, while the hand is given an opposite
direction; that is, the palm of the hand is toward
him.
FIFTH GESTURE.
Devotion.
This gesture embraces scven movements:
1. This consists in raising the passive hand to the
level of the other hand, but in an inverse direction.
2. This consists in turning back the hand toward
one's self.
3. This consists in drawing the elbows to the
body, and placing the hands on the chest.
4. This is produced by taking a step backward,
and turning a third to one side; during the execu-
tion of this step, the elbows are raised, and the head
is lowered.
5. This consists in drawing the elbows near the
body, and placing the hands above the shoulders.
6. This consists in developing the arms.
7. This consists in developing the hands.
SIXTH GESTURE.
Interrogative Surprise.
This surprisc is expressed in two movements:
1. This is wholly facial.
2. This is made by advancing the hand and draw-
ing the head backward.

SEVENTH GESTORT..
Reiterated Interrogation.
This gesture significs: I do not understand, I
cannot explain your conduct to me.
It embraces five steps:
1. This consists in placing both hands bencath the
chin, and violently elevating the shoulders.
2. This consists in bringing the hands to the level
of the chest, as if in scarch of something there.
3. This consists in extending both hands toward
the interlocutor, as if to show him that they contain
nothing
4. This consists in extending one hand in the
opposite direction, and letting the head and body
follow the hand.
5. This consists in turning the head vehemently
toward the interlocutor, and suddenly lowering the
shoulders.
EIGHTH GESTURE..
Anger.
This gesture is made in three movements :
1. This consists in raising the arm.
2. This consists in catching hold of the sleeve.
3. This consists in carrying the clenched hand to
the breast, and drawing back the other arm.
NINTH GESTURE.
Venace.
This gesture consists of a preparatory move-
ment, which is made by lowering the hand while the

arm is outstretched toward the interlocutor, then the
finger is extended, and the hand is outstretched in
menace.
The eye follows the finger as it would follow a
pistol; this occasions a reversal of the head propor-
tional to that of the hand.
TENTH GESTURE.
An Order for Leaving.
This is executed:
1. By turning around on the free limb.
2. By carrying the body with it.
3. By executing a onc-fifth sideward movement-
the right leg very wcak. All these movements are
made by retaining the gesture of the preceding men-
ace. Then only the menacing hand is turned in-
ward at the height of the eye, at the moment when
it is about to pass the line occupied by the head; ·
the elbow is raised to allow the hand a downward
movement, which ends in an indication of departure.
In this indication the hand is absolutely reversed,
that is, it is in pronation. Then only does the head,
which has hitherto been lowered, rise through the
opposition of the extended arm.
ELEVENTH GESTURE,
Reiteration.
1. The whole body tends toward the hand which
is posed above the head. The right leg passes from
weak to strong

155
2. The head is turned backward toward the inter-
locutor.
3. It rises.
4. The arm extends.
5. The hand in supination gives intimation of the
order.
TWELFTH GESTURE,
Fright.
The right hand pendent. The left hand rises.
Tremor.
The first movement is executed in one-third; the
body gently passes into the fourth, and as the fifth
is being accomplished, the arm is thrust forward as
if to repel the new object of terror.
At this moment a metamorphose seems to take
place, and the object which had occasioned the
fright, seems to be transfigured and to become the
subject of an affectionate impulse. The hands
extend toward this object not to repel it, but to im-
plore it to remain; it seems to become more and
more ennobled, and to assume in the astonished eyes
of the actor, a celestial form- it is an angel. There-
fore the body recoils anew one-fourth; the hands
fall back in token of acquiescence; then, while draw-
ing near the body, they extend anew toward the
angel (here a third in token of affection and vencra-
tion). Then a prayer is addressed to it, and again
the arms extend toward it in entreaty. Here the
orator falls upon his knees.)

The scrics can be cxccuted beginning with the
right arm or the left, being careful to observe the
initial and principal movement, with the arms at
the side where the scene opened. This gives the
same play of organs only in an inverse sense.
Important Remarks.
Should any student despair of becoming familiar
with our method, we give him thrce pieces of ad-
vice, all easy of application:
1. Never speak without having first expressed
what you would say by gesture. Gesture must
always prcccde specch.
2. Avoid parallelism of gesture. The opposition
of the agents is ncccssary to cquilibrium, to har.
mony.
3. Retain the same gesture for the same senti-
ment. In saying the same thing the gesture should
not be changed.
Should the student limit himself to the application
of these three rules, he will not regret this study
of the

In the literary world, color gives forms of speech
consecrated by frequent usage. Thus we very often
say: a florid style, a brilliant orator. This figurative
language significs that in order to shine, the orator
must be adorned with the lustre of flowers. And as
one flower excels others and pleases us by the
beauty of its colors, so the orator must excel, and
please by the brilliant shades of his diction. It is
as impossible to give renown to a monotonous and
colorless orator as to a faded, discolored flower.
Would you give to the phenomena of your or-
ganism this beautiful corolla of the flower of your
garden, throw your glance upon nature,
Nature speaks to the eye through an enchanting
varicty of colors, and these colors in turn teach man
how he may himself speak to the eyes. The whole
man might recognize himself under the smiling
eniblem of colors. Imagine him in whatever state
you will, a color will give you the secret of his
aspirations. And so it has been easy for us to show
you the orator imaged in this colored chart, and we
shall have no trouble in justifying our choice of
colors.
Since man, as to his soul, presents himself in three
states: the sensitive, intellectual and moral; and in
his organism in the eccentric, concentric and normal
states; a priori, you may conclude that nature has
three colors to symbolize the three states, and ex-
perience will not contradict you.
In fact, red, yellow and blue are the primitive

SYMBOLISM OF COLORS.

colors. All others are derived from these three
rudimentary colors.
Why have we painted the column that corresponds
to the life red? Because red is the color of blood,
and the life is in the blood. But life is the fountain
of strength and power. Hence red is the proper
symbol of strength and power in God, in man and
in the demon.
Why blue in the column of the concentric state,
the mind? Because blue, from its transparency, is -
most soothing to our eyes.
Why yellow in the column of the soul? Because
yellow has the color of fame; it is the true symbol
of a soul sct on fire by love. Yellow is, then, the
emblem of pure love and of impure flames.
Why not use white in our chart? Becausc white
is incandescence in the highest degree. We say
of iron that it is at a red or a white heat. But in
this world it is rare to see a heart at a whitc heat.
Earthly thermometers do not mark this degrec
of heat.
It cannot be denied that red, yellow and blue are
the three elementary colors, whose union gives birth
to all the varieties that delight our eyes. We have
proof of this in one of nature's most beautiful phe-
nomena the rainbow.
The rainbow is composed of seven colors. Here
we distinguish the red, yellow and blue in all their
purity; then from the fusion of these three primary
colors, we have violet, orange, green and indigo.

APPENDIX.
This is the order in which the scven colors of the
rainbow appear to us :
Violet (red), orange (yellow), green (blue), indigo.
Orange is composed of yellow and red. Yellow
mixed with blue, produces green. Blue when satu-
rated, becomes indigo. Upon closer investigation,
we may casily find the nine shades which correspond
perfectly to the nine operations of our faculties, and
to the nine functions of angelic minds.
By complicating and blending the mixture of
these colors, we shall have all the tints that make
nature so delightful a paradise.
Thc scvcn notes of music sound in accord with
the seven colors of the rainbow. There is a broth-
crhood betwecn the seven notes and the seven colors.
The voice-apparatus, with that of speech and ges-
ture, is for the orator a pallet like that upon which
the painter prepares and blends those colors which,
under the brush of a Raphael, would at once glow
forth in a mastcrpiccc.
Delsartc's criterion is true; still more, it is beauti-
ful, especially so with its brilliant adornment of the
colors of the rainbow.
We verify our judgment by an explanation of the
colored chart.
As may be seen, this chart is an exact reproduc-
tion of the criterion cxplained at the beginning of
this book, only we have adorned it with colors anal-
ogous to the different states of the soul that art is
called upon to reproduce.

S1.111BOLISM OF COLORS.
101
Beginning with the three transversc columns cor-
responding to the genus, we have painted the lower
column red, the middle column yellow, and the upper
onc blue. These are the three colors that symbol-
.
izc thc life, soul and mind, as well as the gencra.
Passing to the vertical columns which correspond
to species, we have painted the first column red, the
second yellow, and the third blue, passing from left
to right. The blending of these colors produces the
variety of shades we might have in this representa-
tion.
Blue added to blue gives indigo; blue with yellow
gives a deep green: with red, violet. Yellow passed
over to the middle column, gives bright green upon
bluc; pure yellow, when passed upon yellow, and
orange upon reci.
Thus pure red will be the expression of the sen-
sitive state or the lifc. Orange will render soul from
liſc, and violet will be the symbol of mind from life.
Applying this process of examination to the two
other columns, we shall know by one symbolic color,
what the soul wishics at the present hour, and these
same colors will, besides, serve to regulate the atti-
tuile of our organs.
Honor and thanks to the genius which gives lis
this criterion, where is reflected the liarmony of all
worlds!

EPILOGUE.
In this rational grammar of the art of oratory, 1
have given the rules of all the fine arts.
All arts
have the same principle, the same means and the
same end. Thcy are akin, they interpenctrate, they
mutually aid and complete each other. They have
a common scope and aim. Thus, music needs speech
and gesture. Painting and sculpture derive their
merit from the beauty of attitudes. There is no
masterpiece outside the rules here laid down.
It is not enough to know the rules of the art of
oratory. He who would become an orator, must
make them his own. Even this is not enough for
the free movement of the agents which reveal the
mind, the soul and the life. The method must be
so familiar as to seem a sccond nature. Woe to the
orator if calculation and artifice bc divined in his
speech! How shun this quicksand? By labor and
cxercise. The instruments and the manner of using
them are in your hands, student of oratory. Set
about your work. Practice gymnastics, but let them
bc gymnastics in the service of the soul, in the serv.

EPILOGUE.
ice of noblc thoughts and generous sentiments -
divine gymnastics for the service of God.
Kcnew your nature. Lay aside thc swaddling.
bands of your imperfections, conform your lives to
the highest ideals of uprightness and truth. Excrcise
your voice, your articulation and your gestures. If
nccd bc, like Demosthenes, place pobbles in your
mouth; repair like that great orator to the sca-shore,
brave the fury of the billows, accustom yourself to
the tumult and roar of asscmblies. Do not ſcar the
fracture or dislocation of your limbs as you scck to
render them supple, to fashion them after the model,
the type you have before your cycs. Labor omnia
rincil.
In any cvent, be persevering. Novitiate and ap-
prenticeship in any profession, are difficult. In
cvery state the bitterness of trial is to be expected.
To arrive at initiation has its joy's, to arrive at per-
ſection is a joy supreme. Beneath the rind of this
mechanism, this play of organs, dwells a vivifying
spirit. Bencath thcsc tangible forms of art, the
Divine lies hidden, and will be revealed. And the
soul that has once known the Divine, feels pain no
longer, but is overwhelmed with joy.
Art is the richest gift of heaven to carth. The
true artist does not grow old; he is never too old
to feel the charm of divine beauty. The more a
soul has been deccived, the more it has been
chastened by suffering, the more susceptible it is to
the benchts of art. This is why music soothes our

of the poor.
Return, then, with renewed enthusiasm to your
work! The end is worth the pains. The human
organism is a marvelous instrument which God has
given for our usc. It is a harmonious lyre, with
rine chords, each rendering various sounds. These
thice chords for the voice, and three for both
besture and specch, have their thousand resonances
it thic scrvice of thic life, the soul and the mind.
As these chords vibrate beneath your fingers, they
will give voice to the emotions of the life, to the
jubilations of the hicart and thic raptures of the
mind. This delightful concert will lend enchant-
ment to your passing years, throwing around them
all the attractions of the Good, thc Truc, and the
Beautiful.
We may well salute the three Graces and the
ninc Muscs as gracious emblems, but it is far
better to discern in art, the reflected image of the
triple celestial hicrarchy with its ninc angel cho-
ruscs.
Honor, then, to the fine arts! Glory to eloquence !
Praise to the good man who knows how to speak
well ! Blessed be the great orator!

ducts or leads back to God.

INTRODUCTION.
To the Editor of " The Voice":
In intense interest is felt by a considerable class of persons in the
ivachings of François Belsarte, the unparallclei master of the science
and art of expression. But nearly all that is locfore the public con.
sists of his empirical methols as inadequately reported by others.
lle died suddenly and prematurely without having, in any finishel
form, committed his theoretical insights to paper.
I have the
pleasure, herewith, of submitting to your realers the beginning of a
treatise by him on "'The Attributes of Reason." It was his last
composition, and was left a mere fragment, at his death. It is trans.
lated directly from his own manuscript. It furnishes a better speci.
men, perhaps, than is yet available elsewhere of his acuteness, depth
and originality as a thinker. While it may be too difficult for some
of the subscribers to The Voice, there are others, I am sure, who
will read it with edification and gratitucle.

THE ATTRIBUTES OF REASON.
BY FRANÇOIS DELSARTE.
THE HUMAN REASON, that haughty faculty, dcificd
in our age by a myriad of perverse and commonplace
minds known under the derisive and doubly vain
title of freethinkers, is but blind, despite its high
opinion of its own insiglit. Yes, and we affirmi by
certain intuition that man's reason is not and cannot
bc otherwise than blind, aside from the revealing
principle which only enlightens it in proportion to
its subordination; for, abandoned to itself, reason
can only err and must fatally fall into an abyss of
illusions.
The melancholy age in which we live but too often
offers us an example of the lamentable mistakes into
which we are hurricd by misguided reason, which,
yielding to a criminal presumption, deserts without
remorse the principle super-abounding in life, light
and glory.
To understand such an anomaly, to explain how
reason, which constitutes one of the highest attri-

butcs of man, is so far subjcct to error, it is essential
to have a thorough apprehension of the complexity
of its nature. What, then, is the real nature of the
reason so little studied and so illy known by those
very men who raise altars in its honor? Let us try
to produce a clear demonstration. And let us first
say that reason docs not constitute a primary prin-
ciplc in man; for a primary principle could never
mistake its object. Neither is it a primary faculty;
.
it is only the form or the manner of being of such
a faculty, and thus cannot be a light in itself. The
rays by which it shines are external to it in the
sense that it receives them from the principle which
governs and fertilizes it. Still, let us say that,
although ncither a principle nor a faculty, reason is
nonc the Icss, with conscience, of which it forms the
base, the noblest power of man; for this power God
created free; free from subjection to the principle
that enlightens it; free, too, to escape from it. Yet
every power necessarily recognizes a guiding princi-
ple to whose service it needs must bow; but to rea-
son alone it is granted to avoid the law which impe-
riously rules the relations of the harmonious subordi-
nation of principiant faculties to their principles.
Hence the error or possible blindness of reason;
hence also its incomparable grandeur, which lics
solely in its free and spontaneous subordination.
These principles established, let us go still farther,
and penetrate deeper into the mysterious genius of
reason.

St. Thomas, in whom shone the most perfect rea-
son of which humanity can boast, was pre-eminently
authorized to define reason. He did it in terms at
once so simple, so precisc, and of such exquisite
clarity, that we may venture to think that reason
itself could not have better rendered the terms of
its own entity
This definition, let no one fail to sce, contains in
its cxtrcme brcvity more substance than would fill
a voluminous treatise. This, then, is his definition:
Reason is the discursive form of the intellect.
Now by this St. Thomas plainly establishes that
reason, distinct from the intellcct, with which we
must beware of confounding it, proceeds from it as
effect proceeds from causc. Therefore, intcllect
surpasses reason as its principiant and guiding
faculty; and reason only figures in the intelligential
sphere, despite the important part it plays in virtue
of its adjunctive or supplementing power.
But what is the purpose of this adjunction?
Here, in reply to this grave and important question,
let us refer to what the same scholar says elsewhere.
“Reason arises,” he says, “from the failure of
intellcct.".. Certainly this is a luminous, and doubt.
less a very unexpected proposition. From it we
Icarn, on the one hand, that the intellect is liable to
dcfccts and consequently to weaknesses; on the
other hand, it seems established that the adjunctive
power comes to aid the faculty which governs it,

since here the subjected is born of the failure of the
subjector.
Let us explain this fresh anomaly. We have in
the first place declared the preceding proposition
luminous in spite of the obscurity into which we are
plunged by the consequences which we have derived
from it; but, patience! We are already aware that
it is from the very obscurity of things that the
brightest light somctimes bursts upon contempla-
tive cycs; and since faith is the next principle to
knowledge, let us have faith at least in the trust-
worthiness of him who addresses us, especially as
he has given us repeated, unequivocal tokens of
sound and upright reason. Let us, then, have no
doubt that the preceding proposition contains a
precious precept; and very certainly light will soon
dawn on our mind.
This scttled, and for the better understanding of
the meaning attached to this proposition, let us call
to our aid the powers of analogy.
If reason arises from the failure of intellect it is
doubtless to rectify the valuations of the ego. Now
the compass, which is in itself very inferior to the
hand which fashions it and appropriates it to its
own use, nevertheless implies a defect in that hand
which directs it. So there is between the eye and
thc telescope, which comes to its aid, all the distance
that divides the faculty from the instrument which
it governs. Still the telescope joined to the eye
communicates to it a great power of vision; but the

instrument arises from the failure of the cye, which
is nevertheless infinitely superior to it; for it is the
eye which sees, and not the telescope.
It is thus that we must understand the relations
of reason and intellect. Let us say, then, that the
reason is to the intellect exactly what the telescope
is to the cyc.
This cstablished, we can formulate
the following definition as well founded.
The intellect is the spiritual eye whose mysterious
telescope reason forms, or: reason is a necessary
appendage of mental optics, or again: reason is the
glass used by the eye of a defective intellect.
But this is not all. St. Thomas provides us still
elsewhere with the means of making our analogy
more striking. He says, indeed: reason is given us
to make clear that which is not evident. Is not
this, as it were, the seal of truth applied to our
demonstration? Thus the eye uses the telescope
absolutely as the intellect employs the reason, to
make clear that which is not evident.
Of course it is plain that if the sight and the
intellect answered perfectly to their object, they
could do without this adjunct which betrays their
imperfection. The intellect would thenceforth have
no more need of reason than the eye of glasses.
This explains the fact, so important to consider,
that the clearer the mental vision is the less one rea-
sons. The angels do not reason; they see clearly
what is troubled and confused by our mind. No
onc reasons in heaven, there is no logician there, no

Intelligence is immortal, but reason, which
serves it here below, will fade away in eternity with
the senses which like it do but form the conditions
of time.
Divine reason alone will endure because it has
nothing accidental, and it is substantially united to
the eternal word. It is that reason toward which all
blest intelligences will finally gravitate. Hence, we
scc that what already partakes of the celestial life
repels reasoning as a cause of imperfection or infirm-
ity. It is thus, by its exclusion of reasons, that the
Gospel supremely proves its celestial origin. It is,
indeed, a thing well worth remark, especially worthy
of our admiration, that there is not to be found, in
the four Gospels, a single piece of reasoning, any
more than there is an interjection to be found.
Let us add that faith does not reason: which does
• not mean, as so many misbclicvers feign, that faith
is fulfilled by blindness or ignorance of the objects
of its veneration. Quite the contrary. Faith dis-
penses with reason because of the perfection of its
sight. It is, finally, because it is superior to reason
and sees things from a higher plane. This is what
so many short-sighted people cannot sec; and, to
return to our analogy, it seems to thcm able to sce
nothing save through the glasses of reason. It seems
to them, I say, that any man who does not wear
glasses must see crooked. Keep your glasses, my
good souls! They suit short limits of sight. But

we, who, thank God, have sound sight, are only
troubled and clouded by them.
It is thus that reason, which is given us to make
clear what is not evident, frequently obscures cven
the very evidence itself. We might confirm this
declaration by a thousand examples. To cite but
one, let us point out how plainly the spectacle of
the universe of thought and the idea of a Diving
Crcator prove that no glasses are required to con-
template God in His works. Well! scientists have
felt obliged to direct thcirs upon these simple
notions, and have thus, i. c., by force of reasoning.
succeeded in confusing out of all recognition a
question sparkling with evidence, so much so that
they will fall into such a state of blindness that they
can no longer see in this world any trace of the
Supreme Intelligence which is yet manifested with
glory in the least of His creatures. Consequently,
they will bluntly deny the existence of God; but as
they still must needs admit a creative cause, they
have to that end invented moving atoms and have
made from these strange corpuscles something so
perfectly invisible that they can spare themselves
the trouble of providing public curiosity with a living
proof of their theory.
The scientist is born perverted, as was said
of the Frenchman who created the vaudeville ;. and
men, too strong-minded and above all too full of
reason to give any credence to the mysteries taught
by the church, have displayed a blind faith in respect

to moving atoms. They think thus to set them-
selves free from what they call the prejudices of
their fathers. They find no difficulty in attributing
to invisible corpuscles both the plan and the execu-
tion of the beings who people the universe.
This is the fine conception attributed to what is
called a higher reason-a conception before which
bow legions of strong minds. To such a degree of
degradation can reason drag man down.
It is, therefore, dangerous to consult the reason
in any case where evidence is likely to be called into
play. But, bcfore proceeding farther in the course
of our demonstrations, a question presents itself.
It may be asked what we think of another kind of
reason-puro reason; for it appears that in the
opinion of certain philosophers purc reason does
exist. I do not know where they authenticated and
studied this species of reason. For myself I confess
in all humility that not only have I never seen a pure
reason, but it has never even been possible for me
to raise my mind to the point of comprehending the
signification of pure reason. I greatly fear that some
nonsense lurks within the phrase, such transcenden-
tal nonsense as belongs to ideological philosophers
alone. I know not why, but these gentlemen's pure
reason always gives me the sensation of a strong
blast of moving atoms. In fact, it is not clear; but
why require clarity of philosophers and ideologists ?
But let us leave thicse senseless words and pursue
the course of our demonstrations.

What we have said of reason is quite sufficient to
prevent its confusion with the faculty whose discur-
sive form it is. But this is not enough. We must,
by still more delicate distinctions, make any con-
fusion between these two terms impossible.
Reason, although essentially allied to intelligence,
is not, like it, primordial in man. Thus God created
man intelligent, and consequently susceptiblc of
reason; but we do not see the word reason brought
into play in Genesis, because it merely expresses a
derivation from the mind or intellect. Reason,
therefore, is secondary and posterior in the genetic
order. But here to the support of this assertion we
have a striking and undeniable proof; namely, that
thic infant is born intelligent but not reasonable.
Intellect proceeds directly from that true light which
shines in every man on his entrance into the world,
while reason is merely the fruit of experience. A
proof of the superiority of intelligence to reason is
scen in the fact that it partakes of the immutable,
and is not like the latter, liable to progress.
Thus the child is seen to be as intelligent as an
adult man can be. Let us rather say that it is in the
child especially that intelligence displays its brightest
rays. Yet he is not furnished with reason. And
why not? Because he has no experience. Reason,
therefore, is an acquired power, whose light is bor-
rowed from experience or tradition.
Reason is proportional to the experience acquired.


## p. 16 (#253) #############################################

THE ATTRIBUTES OF REASON.
Practical reason or rationality is the ration or portion
of experience allotted to each person.
Reason is to the mental vision exactly what the
cye is to optical vision, and just as the eye bor-
rows its visual action from external light, so reason
borrows its power of clear and correct vision from
traditional experience. The similarity is absolute.
Suppress light, and vision ceases to be possible.
Suppress revelation from intellectual objects, and
reason is thenceforth blind.
Between reason and intelligence, although there
be inclusion and co-essentiality in these terms, there
is a great difference in the mode of cognizance; for,
as St. Augustine says, intelligence is shown by
simple perception, and reason by the discursive pro-
cess. Thus, while intelligence acts simply, as in
knowing an intelligible truth by the light of its own
intuition, reason goes toward its end progressively,
from one thing known to another not yet known.
The latter, as St. Thomas says, implies an imper-
ſection. The former, on the contrary, bcsccms a
perfect being. It is, therefore, evident, adds the
same profound thinker, that reasoning bears the
samc relation to knowledge that motion does to
repose, or as acquisition to possession. The one is
of an imperfcct nature, and the other of a perfect
nature. Boëthius compares the intellect to eter-
nity; reason, to time.
Yet human reason, according to the principle
which illuminates it, offers three degrees of elevation

which we will distinguish, for readier comprehension,
by three special terms, namely: first, tradition or
the experience of another; second, personal expe-
rience; third, the reason of things.
Trained by tradition, reason is called common
sense. Trained by personal experience to the knowl-
edge of principles, reason is called science. Traired
by the contemplation of principles to the perfection
of the intellect, reason is called wisdom.
What we call practical reason is based upon the
authority of tradition and the lessons of other peo-
ple's experience in regard to the customary and
moral matters of life.
Speculative or discursive reason judges by the
criterion of its own experience; thereby inferring
consequences more or less in conformity with tradi-
tional teachings, and arriving by the logical order
of its deductions and in virtue of the principles
which it accepts and which it applies to its discover-
ies, at what we call science.
Transcendental reason pursues, in the effects
which it examines, the investigation of their cause,
and rises thence to the very reason of things.
Wherefore it silences reasoning, enters into a silent
and persistent course of observation, consults the
facts, examines, studies and questions the principles
whence it sees them to be deduced; and, without
yielding to the obscurity in which these principles
are enveloped, pierces that obscurity by the pene-
trative force of unremitting attention. Inspired by

the standard of faith, it knows that the spirit of God
exists at the root of these mysteries. It clings
thereto, unites itself thereto by contemplation, and
finally draws from this union its strength, its light
and its joy.
Such is the course of wisdom, and such are the
inestimable advantages of faith to reason. It is in
fact by faith that reason is aggrandized and elevated
to the height of the intellect whence it draws its
certitude.
Reason believes because it desires to understand,
and because it knows that faith is the next principle
to knowledge.
Thus the grandeur of reason is proportioned to
its humility; proportioned, I would say, to the
efforts which it multiplies to forget itself when the
truth addresses it. But such is not thc method of
procedure of "strong minds." They have a horror
of the mysteries toward which they are still urged
by correct instincts. The fact is, let us say it
boldly, they fear lest they find God there.
In these misguided spirits there is so much pre-
sumption, self-conceit, self-love, that they are, in the
nullity of their lofty pride, a worship unto them-
selves, an idolatry of their own reason. They
have deified it,--that poor, frail reason; and this,
while mutilating it, while proclaiming it independent
and free from all law, from all principle, from every-
thing dcfinite.
To what excess of imbccility, then, have we not

seen these freethinkers fall, these apostles of inde-
pendent reason, who on principle boast that they have
no faith and no law! Thence comes the scorn which
afflicts these unbelievers for all who believe and hope
here below; thence, their systematic ignorance of
fundamental questions; thence, the incurable blind-
ness in which they bask; thence, finally, the incon-
sistencies and contradictions which make them a
spectacle humiliating to the human mind.
But agnostic man labors in vain. He cannot
escape the mysteries which surround him on every
hand, like a gulf in which reason is inevitably.Jost
so soon as it ceases to seek the light.
Man stumbles at every turn against the efforts of
a stronger reason than his own,—the Supreme Reason
before which, nilly nilly, his must bow and confess
the insanity of its judgments.
Logic is not, to reason, a sure guide; and even
where it feels its foothold most strong, it sometimes
trips, to the disgrace of the good opinion it had of
its own infallibility.
Let us show by a simple example to what rebuffs.
our reason is exposed when counting on the sup-
port of its logic, face to face with the reason of facts.
Undoubtedly it is logical and perfectly in conform-
ity with reason, to say that one and one make two.
No doubt seems possible on that point. Well, this
elementary truth, the most undeniable in the eyes
of all men which can be produced, does not, despite
the assurances which seem to uphold it, constitute

!
an impregnable axiom; for there are cases when
one and one do not make two! Certainly such a
proposition seems scarcely reasonable, for its admis-
sion would entail the reversal of what are called the
sound notions of logic! But what will the logician
say if I affirm that in a certain case, one and one
make but one-half? Would he even take the
trouble to refute me? No, he would laugh in my
face; he would not listen to me; he would tax me
with absurdity and insanity, preferring thus to lose
a chance of instruction rather than confess the impo-
tence of his logic.
There is the evil, and it is generally in this way
that ignorance is perpetuated. But let us return to
the fact which we desire to prove, contrary to logic
and the pretensions of ordinary reason.
Now, it is logical and perfectly in conformity with
reason to say that two musical instruments make
more noise than one; and that thus two double
basses, for example, tuned in unison and placed side
by side, produce one sound of a double intensity.
This seems an elementary matter. It is as clear, you
say, as that one and one make two. Well, no, it is not
so clear as you suppose. It is, on the contrary, a
mistake; for attentive experiment proves that
the result is diametrically opposite to the logical
conclusion.
This is a fact which no argument can destroy.
Two double basses, placed in the above-named con-
ditions-conditions of vicinity and tonal identity-

far from adding up their individual result, are thus
reduced each to a quarter of its own sonority, which
in the sum total, instead of producing a double sound,
produces a sound reduced to half of that given indi-
vidually by each instrument taken alone. This is
how a power plus an analogous power equals together
with it but half a power; and thus we are forced
to admit that one and one do not necessarily make
two.
I have carried the experiment still farther; in the
instrument which gained me a first-class medal at
the exhibition of 1854, I was enabled to put thirty-
six strings of the same piano into unison at once.
Well! All these strings, struck simultaneously, did
not attain to the intensity of sound produced by one
of them struck singly. All these sounds, far from
gaining strength by union, reciprocally neutralized
one another. This is not logical, I admit; but we
must submit to it.
Logic must be silent and reason bow before the
brutal force of a fact to which there is no objection
to be raised.
Since we are on the subject of the phenomena
of sonority, let us draw another illustration from it,
quite as overwhelming in its illogicalness as the
former.
When two similar phenomena differ from one
another on any side, the discord brought about by
this difference is more apparent and more striking
by reason of the closer conjunction of these phenom-
1

ena. By way of compensation the dissimilarity is
less appreciable in proportion as these phenomena
are farther apart from each other.
This is rigorously logical and perfectly conform-
able to reason; yet there are cases where we must
affirm the contrary. Thus the same sound produced,
I will suppose, by two Autes not in accord with one
another, forms those disagreeable pulsations in the
air which discordant sounds inevitably produce.
There seems to be no doubt that by gradually
bringing these discordant instruments together, the
falseness of their relation must be more and more
striking, more and more intolerable. Wrong! For
then, and above all if the mouths of these instru-
ments be concentrically directed, a mutual translo-
cation is produced between the two discordant
sounds, which restores the accuracy of their agree-
ment. Thus the lower sound is raised, while the
higher one is lowered, in such a way that the two
sounds are mingled on meeting and form a perfect
unison. Now, here are contrasts, which, contrary to
all rational data, so far from being exaggerated
by contact, diminish gradually, until they are utterly
annihilated. Thus, then, given two instruments of
the same nature, if the harmony which they effect
be true, they enter by reason of their conjunction
into a negative state which neutralizes their sonority;
while the contrary occurs in the case of false unison.
Here the instruments become identical with one

another, the sonority is increased and the tonal
deviation is corrected to the most perfect harmony.
Obstinate rationalists, what is your logic worth
here? Has it armed you against the surprises held
in store for you by a multitude of facts inaccordant
with your reasonings? Oh, proud and haughty rea-
your head! Confess the inanity of your
ways. Bow yet, once again, and contemplate the
mystery whence luminous instruction shall beam for
son, bow
you !
At bottom these mysteries may surprise and
baffle a reason deprived of principle; but they are
never contrary to it, because they proceed from
reason itself, from that Supreme Reason which cre-
ated us in its own image; and, by that very fact, is
always in accord with individual reason in so far as
this will consent to sacrifice its own prejudices to it,
or listen to its infallible lessons.
But man's reason most frequently heeds itself
alone. Thence, once again, arise its infirmities.
Thus, what will happen, if, because the truths
which I utter here are obscure and do not at the
first glance appear to conform to the requirements
of logic, you. hastily reject them with all the lofti-
ness of your scornful reason, which would blush to
admit what it did not understand! Poor reason!
which in and of itself understands so little, and
admits so many follies, as soon as a scholar affirms
them. The consequence will be that you will be

rance.
Behold that proud reason which would never
bend before a mystery revealed, behold it, I say,
bowed beneath the weight of prejudices, which there
will be more than one scholar, more than one
logician, ready to endorse.
Thus reason will refuse as unworthy itself, all
belief in the actions of God or of unseen spirits, the
angels, heaven, but will not dare to doubt the exist-
ence of moving atoms, invisible corpuscles. This is
the mental poverty into which the enemies of religious
faith unwittingly fall. They pervert that instrument
of reason whose true use is to supplement and fortify
imperfect intelligence, and misuse it to discredit and
overthrow the original intuitions of intelligence.

CHAPTER I.
THE BASES OF THE SCIENCE.
Delsarte published no book upon art. The bases
of the science which he created are contained in a
synthetical table. Other tables develop each branch
of it considered separately.
Starting from an undeniable law—that which
regulates the constitution of man,-Delsarte applies
it to ästhetics; he designatcs man as “the object
of art," and groups in series the organic agents that
co-operate in the manifestation of human thought,
sentiment and passion; declaring the purpose of
these manifestations, now become artistic, to be the
amelioration of our being by throwing into relicf
and light the splendors of moral beauty and the
horrors of vice.
Delsarte defines art in several ways. He has
been reproached for his over-amplitude of definition,
and his development of it in a sense too metaphysi-
cal for a science which he himself calls “positive.".
I give here only such definitions as seem to me
most clear and important
“Art is at once the knowledge, the possession
and the free direction of the agents by virtue of
which are revealed the life, soul and mind. It is
the appropriation of the sign to the thing. It is the

relation of thc bcautics scattered through nature to
a superior type. It is not, therefore, the more
imitation of nature."
The word life, in the scnsc cmployed above, is the
cquivalent of sensation, of physical manifestations.
Man being the object of art, it is from the work-
ing of the various faculties of the human organism
that Delsartc dcduces the task of the artist; as
from the knowledge of the essential modalitics of
the cgo, he deduces his law of general asthetics.
Dclsartc tcaches, therefore, that man is a triplicity
of persons; that is, he contains in his indestructible
unity, three principles or aspects, which he calls
life, soul and mind; in other words, physical, moral
and intellectual persons.
In this statement this master agrees with the
philosophers who give a triplicity of essential prin-
ciples as the base of ontology. Pierre Leroux
names them as follows: sensation, sentiment, con-
sciousness.
That which is personal to Delsarte is thic deriva-
tion of the law of asthetics from this conception of
being
The primal faculties once ascertained, he devotes
himself to an analysis of the organism; he describes
the harmony of cach of these faculties with the
apparatus which serves it as agent for manifesting
itself, and demonstrates the fitness of cach organ for
the task assigned it. The master cstablishes that
the inflections of the voice betray more especially

the sensitive nature; that gesture is the interpreter
of emotion; that articulation-a special element of
specch—is in the direct service of intelligence and
thought. He gave the name of vocal to the active
apparatus of sensation; dynamic to that of scnti-
ment; buccal to that of articulation.
From the union of the facultics and their agents
arise three modes of expression: the language of
affection, the language of ellipsis (or gesture) and
the language of philosophy. They respond to the
three states which Delsarte recognizes in man, and
which the artist is to translate the sensitive stati,
corresponding to the life; the moral state, to the
soul; the intellectual state, to the mind.
But this division into three modalitics or into three
states is far from giving the number of the manifes.
tations of being. Nature is not reduced to this
indigence. From the fusion of these three states,
in varying and incessant combination, and from the
predominance of one of the primitive modalities,
whether accidental or permanent, countless indivi-
dualitics are formed, cach with its personal constitu-
tion, its shades of difference of education, habits,
age, character, etc.
It scems at the first glance as if the mind must be
confused by these varietics, whose possible number
fades into infinity; but the teacher does not open
this labyrinth to his disciples without providing them
with a clue.
Independently of these modalities, of these states,


## p. 32 (#269) #############################################


32
ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
which form the basis of the system, Delsarte traces
triune subdivisions, which serve as a point of con-
vergence; thus the intermediary rays of the compass
or mariner's card are multiplied, and receive special
names, without ceasing to belong to one of the four
cardinal points.
Whatever, for instance, may be the tendency of
thc individual whom we desire to portray, or to
represent by any art whatsoever, we can think of
him in his normal state, as well as in a concentric or
eccentric state: this is a first distinction.
Each of these states is itself subject to shades
of difference, to modifications. The normal state
of a diplomat and that of an artist could not be the
same. The one, by the very effect of his profes-
sion, will incline to concentration; the other will
tend to expansion, if not to eccentration. Hence a
simplc normal state which is the most common; a
normal-concentric state, a normal-eccentric state:
here we have a second distinction.
Delsarte, in order to avoid confusion between the
word state applied to primordial modalities—which
he defines as scnsitive, moral and intellectual states,
-often uses the word clement in place of that of
state in speaking of concentration, eccentration and
normality, which, in this case, he also calls calm;
but, in teaching, he was always accustomed to use
these more exact terms: normal state, concentric
state, eccentric state.
These differences may occur in regard to cach of
11


## p. 33 (#270) #############################################

THE BASES OF THE SCIENCE,
33
the other terms. Thus we may have the simple
concentric state, the concentro-concentric state, ctc.
It is upon this mutual interpenetration of the
various states in the triple unity, that the master
founds the idea which dominates and pervades his
whole system; the three isolated and independent
terms do not, to his thinking, constitute the integral-
ity of the human ego. To constitute, according to
Delsarte's theory, three, the vital number, it must,
by its very essence, and by inherent force, raise itself
to its multiple nine. This is what the master calls
the nincfold accord.
Medicine-a science which also derives its justifi-
cation from the human organism—from certain
-
points of view affords us analogics to this mixture
of primordial components; for example, nervous
and sanguine temperaments which are blended in
the sanguo-nervous, etc.
If we refer to our own faculties, does it not strike
us indeed, that neither lifc-nor sensation—nor senti-
ment, nor intellect can manifest itself without the
aid of its congeners or co-associates ?
Is intelligence evident elsewhere than in a sensi-
tive being (life)? And even when considering the
most abstract things, does it not bear witness of its
taste, its power of choice (sentiment)? Can senti-
ment be absolutely disengaged from impression
(life)? And if it is not always under the sway of the
idca, is it not certain that it gives rise to it, by pro-
voking observation and reflection (intelect)?

Finally, can an adult-save in the case of absolute
idiocy-cxist by sensitive life alone outside. of all
sentiment and all thought (soul, intellect)?
It is by the harmony of the modalities among
themselves, and the contribution of cach to the
unity, that every individual type is formed. Del-
sarte thought that he could fix their numerical
scale; but he was not permitted to carry his scien-
tific studies thus far; still, it is not indispensable to
art, which demands above all things very marked
types, that verification should be carried to its
farthest limits. It will not be difficult, guided by
the knowledge which Delsartc has left us, to
classify artistic personages as physical, intellectual
and moral or sentimental types; and, in the same
category, to differentiate those belonging to the
concentric state from those falling more particularly
into the eccentric or normal states: the Don Juans,
Othellos, Counts Ory, etc. Delsarte, in practice,
excelled in characterizing these shades of difference.
These prolegomena would not perhaps alone
suffice to give this teacher a claim to the title of
creator of a science. Although they give the theory
of the system, they are far from containing all its
developments. But Delsartc did not stop here.
In appropriate language—wherein new words are
not lacking for the new science—he takes apart
each of the agents of the organism, enumerated
above; he examines them in their details, and
assigns them their part in the sensitivc, moral, or

intellectual transmission with which they are charged.
Thus gesture—the interpreter of sentiment–is pro-
duced by means of the head, torso and limbs; and
in the functions of the hcad are comprised the
physiognomic movements, also classificd and de-
scribed, with their proper significance, such as anger,
hate, contemplation, etc.,-and the same with the
other agents.
Each part observed gives rise to a special chart,
where we sce, for instance, what should be the posi-
tion of the eye in exaltation, aversion, intense appli-
cation of the mind, astonishment, etc. The same

tudes of the body, with the mark, borrowed from

corresponding to the sensation, the sentiment, the
thought that the artist wishes to express.
I hope that these works may yet be recovered

they may be given to the public.*
An exact science at first sight appears contradic-
tory to art. Will it not diminish its limits,
trammel its transports? Will it not prove hostile to
its liberty at every point?
Will it not
check the flights of its graceful fancy, its adorable
caprice?
No, indeed! as I said in regard to the ideal, the
thcories of Delsarte, far from hampering the free

expansion of art, do but cnlarge its horizons, and
prepare a broader ficld for its harmonies. They
leave freedom to the opinions most difficult of
seizure, the most unforeseen creations; because, re-
sponding to every faculty of being, this science,
while it corrects imagination, respects its legitimate
power.
Finally, what is this science which analyzes every
spring and every part brought to play in the mani-
festation of life? A compass to guide us to the
desired goal; a measure of proportion to fix each
variety in the immensity of types; a touchstone by
which to judge of cach man's vocation.
But do not let us forget that if this science holds
back, restrains and preserves us from parasites,
if it prepares proper soil, and assists feebly
dowercd naturcs to acquire real value, it cannot sup-
ply the place of those marvelous talents, that person-
ality, which showed us, in Delsarte himself, the heights
to which a dramatic singer may attain. What sur-
prises and subjugates us in these privileged persons is
the secret of nature; it is not to be written down,
not to be demonstrated; this unknown quantity, this
mystery, reveals itself at its own time by flashes,
and with different degrees of intensity during the
career of the same artist. Some have thought to
explain the prodigy by that superior instinct known
as intuition; but the discovery of the word does not
open the arcanum.

such minds as are apt for the subject, and endowed
with sufficient penetration to assimilate it; but it
must not be disguised that even should the whole
work be collected together, the science must still
await its examination, its verification and its com-
plements; for a science at its birth is like a pro-
gram given out for the study of present and future
generations. Delsarte was still working on his to
the last years of his life. Every day he gained fresh
insight; he added branches and accessories. Yet
the criticisms of details which will come later-even
when they are justified, will not rob the inventor

CHAPTER II.
THE METHOD.
I have shown Delsarte as a composer, as pre-emi-
nently an artist, who, as a certain critic says, “was
never surpassed;" I have insisted upon the two
titles which form his special glory: that of revealer
of the laws of æsthetics, and that of creator of a
scicncc to support his discoveries ; a science whose
application relates particularly to the dramatic and
lyric arts, although at its base, and especially when
considered as law, it embraces all the liberal arts.
It remains for me to speak of his method, properly
so called; of his precepts, his maxims, his opinions
and his judgments; of that, in a word, which con-
stitutes the personal manner of cach master, and
his mode of instruction; for if the law is single in
its essential and constitutive ideas, it radiates into
diversity in its individual manifestations; it has infi.
nito possibilitics.
Dclsarte considered art as the surest, purest and
most constant good in life. He required much time
to complete the education of a pupil, because he
knew how long it had taken him to master the
methods of translating, through that noble interpre-
ter, art. the best and most sublime possibilities of
the human soul; and because he knew as well all

39
that is inherent in our nature of vice and imperfcc-
tion. He held that the truth, be it good or bad, is
always instructive.
In regard to truth he says: “A man may possess
remarkable qualities, may have grace, expression,
charm and elegance, but they are all as nothing iſ
he does not interpret the truth." He desired the
artist to study beauty in every form, to scek and dis-
cover its secrets. He tells us that he himself
studied the poses of the statues of antiquity for fif-
toen years.
It was in consequence of this period of study,
assuredly, that the master condemned the parallel
movement of the limbs in gesture, and recommended
attitudes which he called inverse; if, for instance,
the actor leans on his left leg, the corresponding
gesture must necessarily be entrusted to the right
arm.
The master taught that thic gesturc—the true
interpreter of the sentiment-should procede the
word. He added: “The word is but an ccho, tha
thought made external and visible, the ambassador
of intelligence. Every energetic passion, every
decp sentimentis accordingly announced by a sign
of the head, the hand or the eye, before the word
expresses it.” Thus, the actor and the orator, if
they do not conform to this precept, have failed to
attain to art.
Delsarte proves his assertion by giving cxamples,
somewhat overdrawn, in a sense the inverse of this

theory. Nothing was more amusing than to sce
him execute one of these dilatory gestures; for
instance, this phrase, uttered by the lackey of some
comedy, delivering a message: “Sir, here is a letter
which I was told to deliver to you at once." The
hand extending the note unscasonably, produced so
ridiculous an effect that the heartiest laughter never
failed to follow.
On Ellipsis.
The preceding steps lead us to ellipsis, which plays
an important part in the method of Delsarte.
All the thoughts and sentiments contained in lit-
erature, in one comprehensive word, are entrusted
to the mimic art of the actor, whose essential agent
is gesture. The conjunction and interjection are
alike elliptical; thus in the phrase: "Ah!
how unhappy I am!
“Ah!" should imply
a painful situation before the explanatory phrase
begins. In his course of applied esthetics, Delsarte
gives us the striking effects of the elliptic conjunc-
tion.
On Shades and Inflections.
The shade, that exquisite portion of art, which is
rather felt than expressed, is the characteristic sign
of the perfection of talent; it forms a part of the
personality of the artist. You may have heard a
play twenty times with indifference, or a melody as
often, only to be bored by it; some fine day a great
actor relieves the drama of its chill, its apparent

than
nullity; the commonplace melody takes to itself
wings bencath the magic of a well-trained, cxprcs-
sive and sympathetic voice. Delsarte possessed this
artistic talent to a supreme degree, and it was onc
of the remarkable parts of his instruction; he had
established typical phrases, where the merc shade
of inflcction gave an appropriate meaning to every
varicty of impression and sentiment which can pos-
sibly be expressed by any one sct of words.
of these phrascs was this: “That is a pretty dog!"
A very talented young girl succeeded in giving to
these words a great number of different modulations..
expressing endearment, coaxing, admiration, ironi-
cal praise, pity and affection. Delsarte, with his far.
reaching comprehension, conceived of more
600 ways of differentiating these examples; but he
stopped midway in the execution of them, and cer-
tainly no one else will ever pursue this outline to its
farthest limits.
The second phrase was: “I did not tell you
I would not!"
This time the words were given as a study for
adults; they lent themselves to other sentiments;
they revealed, as the case might be, indifference,
reproach, encouragement, the hesitation of a troubled
soul, etc.
It was by means of these manifold shades
the artist-professor established characteristic differ
ences in parts wherein so many actors had seen
the identical fact of a similar passion or a similar

vice. To his mind, all misers were not the same
miser, nor all seducers the same seducer. In sing-
ing particularly, with what art Delsarte used the in-
flection !
On Vocal Music.
In regard to lyric art especially, Delsarte had his
peculiar and personal theories. Singing was not to
him merely a means of displaying the singer's voice
or person; it was a superior language, charged
with the rendition, in its individual charm, of all the
greatest creations of literature and poetry; all the'
sweet, tender, or cruel sentiments possible to hu-
manity.
This exceptional singer attained his effects partly
by means of certain modifications of the rhythm,
which caused inattentive critics to say: “ Delsarte
does not observe the measure.” What they them-
sclves failed to note, was that the first beat was
always given firmly; and that it was in the divisions of
onc measure, and by subtle compensations, that he
made the difference. Far from having cause for com-
plaint, the composer gained thereby, a more clear
expression of his thought, a more persuasive expan-
sion of his sentiment, and the respiration appeared
more casy. It was something similar—with a greater
value-to that personal punctuation with which skil-
ful readers often divide the text which they translate.
It was particularly in recitative, the style, more-
over, least subject to precise laws, that Delsarte

43
used this license; and it was in this style that he
especially excelled.
And is it not in what remains unwritten that the
singer's true greatness is revealed? What dilettante
has not felt the power of a more incisive attack of
the note; of that prolongation of the note, held
imperceptibly, which, having captured it, holds the
attention of the listener?
But, to hear these things, it is not necessary, as
the saying is, "to bestride technique." In so far as
the training of the voice is concerned, Delsarte gave
himself a scientific basis. He was the first to think
that it would be well to know the mechanism of the
organ, that it might be used to the best advantage,
both by avoiding injurious methods of exercising it,
and by aiding the development of the tone by ap-
propriate work.
In his rooms were to be seen imitations of the
larynx—in pasteboard-of various sizes. His pu-
pils, it seems to me, could profit but little by these
far from pleasing sights. At the utmost it increased
their confidence in the man who desired an inti-
mate acquaintance with everything relating to the
art which he taught. It is to teachers particularly
that the introduction of this auxiliary into the study
of the vocal mechanism may have been of some
value. I have lately learned that several singing
teachers use these artificial larynxes. Can priority
be claimed for Delsarte? I can only affirm that he

refers to them in a treatise signed by himself, and
dated in the year 1831.
I shall not enter into the details of this contin-
gent side of the method; the statement of the facts
is enough to lead all those who are interested, to
devote thought and study to the matter. I prefer
to dwell upon the things which Delsarte carried
with him into the grave, having written them only
on the memories of certain adepts destined to dis-
appear soon after him.
On Respiration.
Delsarte established his theory of diaphragmatic
breathing in accordance with his anatomical knowl-
edge. It consists in restoring the breath, without
effort, from the commencing liſt of the diaphragm to
the production of the tone. He opposed it to the cos-
tal breathing, which brings the lungs suddenly into
action by movements of the chest and shoulders, and
causes extreme fatigue. “The chest,” he says,
" should be a passive agent; the larynx and mouth,
a
aiding the diaphragm, alone have a right to act in
breathing; the action of the larynx consists of a
depression, that of the mouth should produce the
canalization (concavity) of the tongue and the ele-
vation of the veil of the palate.”
To this first idea is attached what the master
taught in regard to the distinction between vital
breath and artificial breath. It is certain that
one may sing with the natural respiration; but it is

45
rapidly exhausted if not augmented by additional
inhalation; for it results in dryness and breathless-
ness, which cause suffering alike to singer and
listener. The artificial breath, on the contrary, pre-
serves the ease and freshness of the voice.
On the Position of the Tone.
The placing of the tone was one of Delsarte's
great anxieties. According to his theory, the attack
should be produced by explosion. He rejected that
stress which induces the squeezing out of the
tone after it is produced. The way to avoid it is to
prepare rapidly and in anticipation of the emission
of the note.
These ideas demand oral elucidation; but it is
enough to declare them, for teachers and singers to
recognize their meaning.
On the Preparation of the Initial Consonant.
The preceding lines refer to . vocalization; but
Delsarte applied the same process to pronunciation.
Ho directed that the initial consonant should be pre-
pared in the same way as the attack on the tone; it
was thus produced distinctly and powerfully, that
is, in less appreciable extent of time. Such is the
concentration of the archer preparing to launch an
arrow; of the runner about to leap a ditch. The
master in no case permitted that annoying compass
of the voice before a consonant, so frequently
employed by ordinary singers. The Italians justly

translate this disagreeable performance by the word
strascinato (dragged out or prolonged).
Excrciscs.
Delsartc has been severely blamed for the way in
which he trained the voice. I have nothing to say
in regard to those who imputed to him physical and
barbarous methods of developing it; but it may be
true that he endangered it by certain exercises or
by failure to cultivate the mechanism. I do not
feel myself competent to pronounce upon this tech-
nical point, but I can give an exact account of what
was done in his school.
Delsarte directed that the tones should be swelled
on a single note, E flat (of the medium); he
claimed that by strengthening this intermediary noto
the ascending and descending scales were sympa-
thetically strengthened. He thus avoided, as he
said, breaking the high trcblc notes by exercises
which would render the cords too severely tense,
convinced morever, that at a given moment a burst
of enthusiasm and will-power would take the place
of assiduous practice.
He also taught that this special exercise of the
medium would prevent the scparation of the regis.
ters, that phylloxcra of the vocal organ, which
wrecks so many singers, and causes them so many
sorrows. This was the way to gain that mixed voice,
the ideal held up to the scholars as being the most
impressive and the most exquisite; that which at

a
the same time ravished the car and charmed the
heart.
This master considered the chest-voicc as morc
particularly physical; and the head-voice, it must
be confessed, is too much like the voicc of a bird,
to awaken sentiment and sympathy.
Delsarte himself possessed this mixed voice; in
him, it secmed to start from the heart, and brought
tears to eyes which had never known them. The
power of that tone-allied to the perfection of shad-
ing, diction and lyric dcclamation-caused cvery
listening soul to vibrate with latent cmotion which
might never have been waked to life save by that
appeal.
I return to the practice of swelled tones upon the
note E flat. This note certainly acquired broad and
powerful tones about which there was nothing forced,
and which were most agreeable. This develop-
ment was communicated to the neighboring notes.
But did not these advantages take' from the compass
of the scale ? If so, were they a counterbalance to
the injury? I repeat that I dare not affirm anything
in this respect.
Delsarte, assuredly, did not give as much space
to vocalization as other teachers, especially those of
the Italian school.
It is also undeniable, that dramatic singing-
the style which he preferred—is dangerous to the
vocal organism; particularly when one practices the

shriek or scream, which produces a fine effect when
skilfully employed, but is most pernicious in excess.
Delsarte was too conscientious an artist not to
sacrifice his voice, at certain moments, to his pa-
thetic effects; but he was very careful to warn his
scholars against the abuse of this method; he di-
rected them to use it but very rarely, and with the
greatest precaution.
I should also say, in his favor, that light voices
were very differently trained from heavy ones.
Madame Carvalho, who began her studies in his
school, did not alter the flexible but fccble organ she
brought there. Mlle. Chaudesaigues and Mlle. Jacob,
under Delsarte's tuition, attained to marvels of flex-
ibility, without losing any of their natural gifts.
Appoggiatura.
Delsarte brought about a revolution in French
music in everything relating to appoggiatura, or
rather, he restored its primitive meaning. The way
in which he interpreted it has created a school.
He taught that the root of the word-appoggiatura
-being appuyer (to sustain), the chief importance
should be given in the phrase, to appoggiatura, by
extent and expression; the more so that this note
is generally placed on a dissonance; and, according
to this master's system, it is on the dissonance-
and not at random and very frequently, as is the
habit of many singers—that the powerful effect of
the vibration of sound should be produced.
:


## p. 49 (#286) #############################################

THE METHOD.
49
Contrary to this opinion, the appoggiatura was for
a long time used in France as a short and rapid
passing note; it thus gave the music a vivacious char-
acter, wholly discordant with the style of serious com-
positions; the music of Gluck was particularly
unsuited to it.
Roulade and Martellato.
In every school of singing the roulade is effecteu
by means of the staccato and legato. Delsarte had
a marked prejudice in favor of the martellato, which
partakes of both. He compared it, in his pictur-
esque way of expressing his ideas, to pearls united
by an invisible thread.
Pronunciation.
The master's pronunciation was irrcproachable;
not the slightest trace of a provincial accent; never
the least error of intonation, the smallest mistake in
regard to a long or short syllable. What is perhaps
rarer than may be thought, he possessed, in its abso-
lute purity, the prosody of his native language, alike
in lyric declamation and in the cantabile. His pene-
trating tones added another charm to the many
merits which he had acquired by study.
Pronunciation, therefore, was skilfully and care-
fully taught in Delsarte's school. The professor's
first care was to correct any tendency to lisp, which
he did by temporarily substituting the syllables
te, de, over and over again, for the faulty R. This
4


## p. 50 (#287) #############################################

50
ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
substitution brought the organ back to the requisite
position for the vibration of the R.
This process is now in common use; but I can-
not say whether it was employed beforc Delsarte's
day. He obtained very happy results from it.
E mute before a Consonant.
Delsarte did not allow that absolute suppression
of the E mute before a consonant, which seems to
prevail at present, and which produces so bad an
effect in delivery. As the evil, at the time of which
I speak, was yet comparatively unknown, he did not
make it a case of conscience; but if he never lent
himself to this ellipsis, hc, “the lyric Talma," "the
exquisite singer," as he has frequently been called,
should we not regard his abstinence as a condemna-
tion from which there is no appeal? I do not
believe, morcover, that either Nourrit or Dupré
authorized by their example a habit so contrary to
the rules of French versification, so disagreeable
to the well-traincd ear and so opposed to good taste.
Such young singers as have yielded to it, have only
to listen to themselves for one moment to abandon
it forever.
It is certain that E mute can in no instance be
assimilated to the acccntcd E; but to suppress it
entircly, is to break the symmetry of the verse, to
put the measure out of time. It is unmistakable
that the weakness of the vowel, or mute syllable,
concerns the sound, not the duration. Let it die

THE METHOD.
51
away gently; but for Heaven's sake, do not murder
it! Voltaire wrote: “You reproach us with our E
mute, as a sad, dull sound that dies on our lips, but
in this very E mute lies the great harmony of our
prosc and verse." Littré recognizes two forms of
the E mute: the E mute, faintly articulated as in
“ amc,;" and the E mute sounded as in me, ce, le;
but he does not allude to an E which is entirely
null.
Once more, then, that there may be no misunder-
standing, let me say that the word mute added to the
E, has but a relative sense, in view of the two vowels
of the same name and marked with an acute or a
grave accent.
One fact throws light on the question: did any
author ever make a character above the rank of a
peasant or a lackey, say:
"J'aine' bon Lisell'
J'crois qu'ell m'en veut?"
Take an example from Voltaire (tragedy of the
Death of Cæsar): “Voilà vos successeurs, Horace,
Decius." Evidently, if the E mute had not been
counted, the second hemistich of the Alexandrine
verse would have had but five syllables instead of
six.
Would any one like to know how the heresiarchs
of the E mute would manage?
In this instance they would repeat the A of the
penultimate, aspirating it and pronouncing thus:
“ Voilà vos successeurs, Hora ... as', Decius."

52

ה

In this way they would have the requisite number
of syllables; but they would be wholly at odds with
the dictionary of the good actors of the Théâtre
Français.
This falsification is especially common in singing,
though it is no less revolting in that field of art.
How often at concerts—the force of tradition saves
us at the theatre-do we hear even artists of great
reputation pronounce:
" Quel jour prosp...er plus de mystè . . cr," in-
stead of: “ Qucl jour prospère plus de mystère.” And,
in one of the choruses of the opera "La Reine de
Chypre" :
" Jamais, jamais on Fn:! ... ang!
Jamais l'Anglais ne régncra/"
Instead of:
“Jamais, jamais en France,
Jamais l'Anglais ne régnera /"
This anomaly is most offensive in the final syl-
lable of a verse, because there the measure is more
impaired than ever, and in this way that alternation
of male and female rhymes is suppressed, which
produces so flowing and graceful a cadence in
French verse
E mute before a Vowel.
The encounter of E mute in a final syllable, with
the initial vowel of the word which follows it, makes
the defect more apparent and accordingly easier to
fight against.
Delsarte's process was as follows: When a silent

THE METHOD.
53
syllable is immediately followed by a word begin-
ning with another vowel, the E mute (by a pro-
longation of the sound of the penultimate) is
suppressed with the next letter. Thus in the aria
of Joseph (opera by Mélul) :
“Loin de vous a langui ma jeund .. scxilée;" and
in Count Ory : “Salut, ô vénéra ... blermite."
In thesc cascs, by an unfortunate spirit of com-
pensation, the abcttors of the innovation, suppress-
ing thic grammatical elision, sing thus:
“Loin de vous a langui ma jeune , . . css'exiléc.”
“Salut, o vė::ini ... abl'ermi ...il!”
Littré's Dictionary gives us the same pronuncia-
tion as Dclsartc; and his written demonstration is even
more positive. We find favorables auspices, arbres
abattus, written in this way: "fa-vo-ra-ble-s-autspi-
ces, arbre-s-abattus."
It is, however, very difficult to express these diſ-
ferences exactly, in type: what Littré expresses
radically by typographic characters, is blended with
most natural delicacy by the voice of a singer.
Thus, according to Delsarte, the E mute of a final
syllable should be suppresscd before a vowel, on
condition of a prolongation of the sound, in har-
mony with the penultimate syllable.
According to Delsarte again, according to
taire, according to Littré, the E mute is weakened,
more or less, but never completely suppressed, be-
fore a consonant.

I hope to be pardoned this long digression, think-
ing it my duty to protest against such a ludicrous
method of treating French prosody; I'do so both
in the name of asthetics and as a part of my task as
biographer of Delsarte.
Notes taken by his pupils during the latter years of his lessons prove that the
muster touched upon this question. I do not copy them because, being somewhat
confused, they might give rise to misunderstandings: neither do they in any way con.

“ Science and art form two means of assimilation :

“ Bac actors cxcrt themselves in vain to be moved
and to afford a spectacle to themselves. On the

“ No, art is not an imitation of nature: art is

loud, which is the vulgar voice; and the dynamic-
ally loud, which is the powerful voice."
This assertion is the result of the general theory.
of Delsarte, who places the vocal apparatus under
the direct empire of sensation; while the dynamic
voice is supposed to be moved by a conscious force.
The following phrase scems indicative of this: “A
voice, however powerful it may be, should be inſe-
rior to the power which animates it.”
“External gesture being only the reverberation of
interior gesture, which gives it birth and rules it,
should be its inferior in development."
On the wholc, this is a warning to sobriety in
gesture; but the master always desired, as the case

execution which the artist should learn before handl-
ing a subject, two things are first of all requisite:

“ Be wary of the tremolo which many singers

“ If you cannot conquer your defcct, make it

attained after long struggles with the defect.
“The initial consonant should be articulated dis-
tinctly; the spirit of the word lies in it."

“ A movement should never bc mixed with a
facial trait."
“Things that are said quietly should sing them-
selves in the utterancc."
This idea must have been elaborated in the class.
It undoubtedly had reference to the recitation.
“ Two things to be observed in the consonant:
its explosion and its preparation. The t, d, p, etc.,
keep us waiting; the ch, v,j, prepare themselves, as :
• Vivencs. The vocals ne, me, re are muffled."
The following notes relate more particularly to
æsthetics:
"Æsthetics is the science of the sensitive and
passional manifestations which are the object of art,
and whose psychic form it constitutes."
“We have a right to ask a work of art by what
mcthods it claims to move us, by which side of our
character it intends to interest and convince us."
“ Semeiotics is the science of the organic signs
by which æsthetics must study inherent fitness.
“The object of art, therefore, is to reproducc, by
action of a superior principle (ontology,) the
organic signs explained by semeiotics, and whose fit-
ness is estimated by ästhetics.
“If semeiotics does not tell us the passion which
the sign reveals, how can ästhetics indicate to us

the sign which it should apply to the passion that
it studies?. In a word, how shall the artist translate
the passion which he is called upon to express?
"Asthetics determines the inherent forms of sen-
timent in view of the effects whose truth of relation
it estimatcs.
"Semeiotics studies organic forms, in view of the
sentiment which produces thcm.
“To sum up:
1. “If, from a certain organic form, I infer a
certain sentiment, that is Scmciotics.
2. “If, from a certain sentiment I deduce a certain
organic form, that is Esthetics.
3. “ If, after studying the arrangement of an
organic form whosc inherent fitness I am supposed to
know, I take possession of that arrangement under
the title of methods, invariably to reproduce that form
by substituting my individual will for its inherent
cause, that is Art.
4. “If I determine the initial phenomena under
the impulsion of which the inherent powers act upon
the organism, that is Ontology.
5. "If I tell how that organism behaves under
the inherent action, that is Physiology.
6. “If I cxamine, one by one, the agents of that
organism, it is Anatomy."
I carry the series no farther because the author,
straying more and more aside from æsthetics, his
classification no longer comes under the heading of
this chapter.

CHAPTER IV.
WAS DELSARTE A PHILOSOPHER ?
If we consider philosophy in the light of all the
questions upon which it touches, the subjects which
it embraces, we must answer “ No;" but if we con-
centrate the word within the limits of asthetics, we
may reply in the affirmative. Did not Delsarte point
out the origin of art, its object and its aim?
Not that this master never exceeded the limits of
his science and his method. He had sketched out
a "Treatise on Reason," and had begun to classify
the faculties of being, entering into the subject more
profoundly than the categories of Kant; but all this
only exists in mors outline, in a technology whose
terms have not been weighed and connected to-
gether by a solid chain of reasoning: logic has
not uttered its final word therein.
A separate volume would be required to give an
idea of these gigantic sketches, which must remain
in their rudimentary state.
If Delsarte had finished his work, it would scem that
he must have lcancd toward the scholastic method,
now so much out of favor; but certainly he would put
his own personality into this, as into everything that
he undertook to investigate; for he was held back on
the steeps of mysticism by the science which he had

created, and which could only afford a shelter to the
supernatural as an extension of those psychical
faculties which have been called intuition, imagina-
tion, etc.
Then the influence of Raymond Brucker, who
dicd shortly after Delsartc, being lessened, and con-
scientious and patient study having fcd the fame in
that vast brain, we might have obtained affirmations
of a new order. And Delsarte might have mct with
thinkers like Leibnitz, Descartes and Jean Reynaud,
on that licight where religion is purged of super-
stition and fanaticism, philosophy set free from
atheism and materialism !
If Delsarte had a fault, it was that he regarded
all modern philosophy as sensuous naturalism; and
iſ reason sometimes seemed to him suspicious,
it was because he often confounded it with sophistry,
which reasons indeed, but is far from being reason.
Let us regret that Delsarte never finished his com-
plete philosophy; but let us be grateful to him for
having raised his art and all arts to the level of
philosophy, by giving them truth as a basis and
morality as a final aim; which fairly justifies, it
scems to me, the title of artist-philosopher, which I
have sometimes applied to him.
I should not ncglcct, in this connection, to set
down the explanation, given by Delsarte, of what
hc incant by the word trinity, as used in his scien-
tific system.
The reader cannot fail to see the ele-

ments of a system of philosophy in this succinct
statement, this outline to be filled up:
“ The principle of the system lies in the statement
that there is in the world a universal formula which
may be applied to all sciences, to all things possible:
- this formula is the trinity.
"What is requisite for the formation of a trinity?
“Three expressions are requisite, each presuppos-
ing and implying the other two. Each of three
terms must imply the other two. There must also
be an absolute co-necessity between them; thus, the
three principles of our being-life, mind and soul
form a trinity
“ Why?
Because life and mind are one and the same soul;
soul and mind are one and the same life; life and
soul are one and thc sane minu."

CHAPTER V.
COURSE OF APPLIED ÆSTHETICS.
Meeting of the Circle of Learned Societies.
Independently of its method, which was especially
applicable to dramatic and lyric arts, Delsarte's doc-
trine, as we have seen, drew from the primordial
sources, which are the law of things, the principles
of all poetry, all art and all science. The intense
light which he brought thence was too dazzling for
young scholars, whose minds were rarely prepared
by previous education. It, nevertheless, overflowed
into the daily lessons, and gave them that peculiar
and somewhat singular aspect, which acted even
upon those whose intelligence could not cope with
it. Such is thc mysterious magic of things which
penetrate before they convince.
But these lofty problems demanded an audience
in harmony with their elevation. Delsarte soon
attracted such. Under the title “ Course of Applicd
Æsthetics," he collected in various places, notably
at the “ Circle of Learned Societies," profane and
sacred orators, and learned men of all sorts. There
he could develop points of view as new as they
seemed to be strikingly true. It was on lcaving onc
of these mcctings, that a distinguished painter thus
expressed his enthusiasm : “ I have learned so much

to-day, and it is all so simple and so true, that I am
amazed that I never thought of it before."
The Course of Applied Æsthetics was addressed
to painters, sculptors, orators, as well as to musicians,
both performers and composers; and was finally
cxtended to literary men. This audience of schol-
ars was no less astonished and enchanted than
others had been.
Theory of the Degrees.
The theory of degrees was largely developed at
thesc meetings, and I have purposely delayed it till
this chapter. To understand this thcory-one of
the most striking points in Delsarte's method, and
original with him,-one should have some idea of
the grammar which he composed for the use of his
pupils.
I will not say that this treatisc was complete in
the sense usually attached to the word grammar.
There is no mention of orthograpiny or of lexicol-
ogy; but all that is the very essence of language,
that from which no language, no idiom can escape-
the constituent parts of speech-arc cxamined and
investigated from a philosophic and psychologic
point of view. Just as the author examined the
constitucnt modalities of our being in the light of
æsthetics, lic scized the affinities between thic laws
of speech, as far as regards the voice-logos—and
the moral manifestations of art.
This production of Delsartc has undergone the

.69
fate of almost all his works—it has not been printed.
Indeed, I greatly fear that all his notes on the sub-
ject can never be collected; nevertheless that which
has been gathered together presents a certain devel-
opment. I will not enter into the purely metaphysi-
cal part, limiting myself, as I have done from the
beginning of this study, to making known the con-
ceptions of Delsartc only in so far as they refer to
the special field of æsthetics.
In this category, we find the following definitions
which serve to classify the quantitative values or
degrecs: that is the extent assigned to each articu-
lation or vocal emission to enable it to express the
thoughts, sentiments and sensations of our being in
their truth and proportionate intensity :
1. Substantive is the name given to a group of
appearances, to a totality of attributes.
2. Adjectir'c expresses idcas, simple, abstract.
general and modicative; it is an abstraction in the
substantive.
3. Vcrb is the word that affirms the existence and
the co-existence between the being existing and its
manner of existing: that is to say it connects the
subjcct with the attributė. The verb is not a sign
of action, but of affirmation and existence.
4. The participle alone is a sign of action.
5, 6, 7: The article, pronoun and preposition fit
into the common definitions.
8. The adverb is the adjective of the adjective

of the verb); it modifics them both, and is not
modifiable by either of them; it is a sign of pro-
portion, an intellectual compass.
9. The conjunction has the same function as the
preposition: it unites one object to another object;
but it differs from it, inasmuch as the preposition
has but a single word for its antecedent, and a single
word for its objective case, while the conjunction
ha; an entire phrase for antecedent, and the same
for complement. It characterizes the point of vicw
under the sway of which the relations should be re-
garded: restrictive, as but; hypothetical or condi-
tional, as if? conclusive, as then, etc., etc. The
conjunction presents a general view to our thought,
it is the reunion of scattered facts; it is essentially
elliptical.
10. The interjection responds to those circum-
stances where the soul, moved and shaken by a
crowd of emotions at once, feels that by uttering a
phrase it would be far from expressing what it
experiences. It then exhales a sound, and confides
to gesture the transmission of its emotion.
The interjection is essentially elliptical, because,
expressing nothing in itself, it expresses at the time
all that the gesture desires it to express, for ellipsis
is a hidden sense, the revelation of which belongs
exclusively to gesture.
It must first be noted that these degrees are num-
bered from one to nine, and that, of all the grammati-

cal values defined, the conjunction, interjection and
adverb are classed highest.
Delsarte made the following experiment one day
in the “ Circle of Learned Societies," Juring a lec-
ture:
" Which word," he asked his audience, "requires
most emphasis in the lines-
"The wave draws near, it breaks, and vomits up before our eyes,
.Amid the surging foam, a monster huge of size?”
The absence of any rule applicable to the subject
caused the most complete anarchy among the listen-
ers. One thought that the word to be emphasized
must be monster-as indicating an object of terror;
another gave the preference to the adjective huge.
Still another thought that vomits demanded the
most expressive accent, from the ugliness of that
which it expresses.
Delsarte repeated the lines:
“The wave draws near, it breaks, and.. vomits up before our cyes."
It was on the word and that he concentrated all the
force of his accent; but giving it, by gesture, voice
and facial expression, all the significance lacking
to that particle, colorless in itself, as he pronounced
the word, the fixity of his gaze, his trembling hands,
his, body shrinking back into itself, while his feet
seemed rivcted to the earth, all presaged some-
thing terrible and frightful. He saw what he was
about to rclate, he made you see it; the conjunc-
tion, aided by the actor's pantomime, opened infinite
perspectives to the imagination; his words had

only to specify thc fact, and to justify the emotion
which had accumulated in the interval.
But this particle, which here allows of eight dc-
grecs, is much diminished when it fills the office of
a simple copulative. The extent of the word or
the syllable is always subordinate to the sense of
the phrase; in the latter case it does not require
more than the figure 2.

the sign which it should apply to the passion that
it studies? In a word, how shall the artist translate

also supplied the place of song by the recitation of
certain fables selected from La Fontaine. He
not less perfect in this style than in the interpreta-
tion of the great rôles of tragedy and grand lyric
poems; but it must be acknowledged, that under
this new guise, his talent could not aisplay itself in
all its amplitude; save for the facial expression
which gave the lessons of the apologue a variety of
outline of which La Fontaine himself perhaps never
dreamed .... and in spite of the fine and scholarly
accent which he could give to all those clever bcasts,
he was, on many points, deprived of his power and
his prestige: how endow a lion with the proud
poses of Achilles; and lend thc foolish grasshopper
the satanic charm of Armida?
Instead of noble or terrific attitudes, his scsturc
was confined to a few movements of forearm or
hand; of his fingers, when the intentions were
subtle, more refined .... Still it was always
pleasant to hear him. It was Delsarte restrained,
but not diminished. If you did not recover in his
speaking voice that sort of enchantment with which

his slightly-veiled tone pierced the soul, his accent
remained so pure, so intelligent, that you were none
the less ravished.
When, in the fable of The Two Pigcons, he said:
“ Absence is the greatest of ills,
Not so for you, cruel one! "
He discovered shades, hitherto unknown, with
which to paint reproach mingled with grief. And
when he said:
“ The ant ... is not a lender! ..."
A more affirmative and striking sense of the char-
acter attributed to our thrifty friend, was detached
from this delay, filled up by a negative movement of
the narrator's head.
I Dclsarte had limited himself in his lectures, to
teaching men by means of the menageric, which was
a sly burlesque of the courtiers of Louis XIV.,
perhaps he might have made idolatrous partisans
there as elsewhere; but it seems as if in the expo-
sition of his theory, he posed rather as a censor
than a teacher; he delighted in baffling the mind
by paradoxes.' By annexes superimposed and ill-
blended with his system, he sometimes compromised
those scientific truths whose splendor bursts forth
when they are freed from heterogeneous accessories.
We cannot otherwise explain the resistance of cor-
tain minds, distinguished otherwise, to the recogni-
tion in him of the artist who excited the enthusiasm
of all the most competent critics and brilliant
amateurs.

CHAPTER VII.
EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF A REVELATOR.
1.
In the preceding chapters I have given a summary
of the life and a sketch of the method of Delsarte.
It seems to me that it would not be inappropriate to
show by what considerations he was led to his criti-
cism of the official system of education practiced
up to that time; and how, in consequence, he was
drawn on to the ceaseless search for the laws of
æsthetics, which he continued from his cxtreme
youth until his death. He was careful to note them
down himself, and we have merely to transcribe his
first rough notes, in which he revcals to us the
awakening of his surprise at what hc afterward called
"the inanity, the inconsistency and the contradictions
of schools of art, both private and public."
The manuscript to which I refer and which is
entitled, “Episodes in the Life of a Revelator,"
begins thus, without preamble:
"The subject in question was a scene in the play
of the Maris-Garçons. The young officer whose part
I was studying met, after an interval of several years,
• Delsarte left an unfinished work with this title, which work shows the persistence
with which he observed and analyzed all facts which might be used for his artistic
instruction.

his former landlord, and as he owed him some
money, he desired to show himself cordial: Ah!
how are you, papa Dugrand?' he says, on encounter-
ing him. This apostrophe is therefore a mixture
of surprise, soldierly bluntness and joviality.
“At the first words I was stopped short by an
almost unconquerablc difficulty in regard to gesture.
Do what I would, my manner of accosting papa Du-
grand was grotesque, and all the lessons that I took
on that scenc effccted no change. Another scholar
in my place would have gone on; but the more
insurmountable the difficulty scomed to me, the
higher my ardor rose. However, I had my labor
for my pains.
4.That's not it,' said my instructors. Good
heavens! I knew that as well as they did; but what
I did not know, was why that was not it. It seems
that my professors were equally ignorant, since they
could not tell me exactly in what my way differed
from theirs.
“The specification of that difference wou.a nave
enlightened me, but all remained, with them as with
me, subject to the uncertain views of a vague in-
stinct.
"• Do as I do,' they said to me, one after the other.
“Zounds! the thing was easier said than done.
"Put more enthusiasm into your grecting to papa
Dugrand !'

“The greater was my enthusiasm, the more laugh-
able was my awkwardness.
"See here, watch my movements carefully!'
“I do watch, but I don't know how to go to work
to imitate you; I don't seize the details of your
gesture.' (It varied with every repetition.)
“You don't understand! you don't understand !
your wits must have gone wool-gathering.
You certainly see that the first thing is to stretch
out your arms to your papa Dugrand, since you are
so pleased to see him again!'
“I stretched out my arms to their utmost extent,
but my body, not following the movement, still
wanted poise; and my teacher, for lack of the funda-
mental principles which might have corrected my
persistent awkwardness, fell back on blaming my
unlucky intellect.
“After endless lessons it was impossible for me to
record anything but a silent example, which had not
even the advantage for me of being always in har-
mony with itself."
The poor young student, as you see, was the vic-
tim of a regular obsession.
In the freedom of the copy, before the signature
for press, he gives full scope to this memory. I will
not follow it out into all its digressions.
“Heaven knows, however," he says, concluding
the dialogue between his professors and himself,

ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
“ with what ardor I cultivated my papa Dugrand! I
dreamed of him nightly: I clung to him with all
the frenzy of despair, for I was determined not to
be beaten! I bored my comrades, and my teachers
finally refused to give me another lesson on the
subject; but nothing could daunt thc ardor of my
zeal."
This obstinate persistency, this passion for the
truth foreseen and sought, which absorbed the youth
as if it were a first love, at last won their reward.
Delsarte shall himself relate the lively scene, which
was to him a consolation and a hope, and which
bore such precious fruit for the future.
.
"One day," he says, “I was mcasuring the court-
yard of the Conservatory, as usual, in company
with papa Dugrand, and repeating my how are you?'
in every variety of tone, when, all at once, having
got as far as: 'How are you, pa-' I stopped
short, without finishing my phrasc. It was inter-
rupted by the sight of a cousin of mine, whose visit
was most unexpected.
" • Ah! how are you?' I said, 'how are you, dcar
cou-'
• Here my words were again interrupted by a
surprise far greater than the first. Struck by the
analogy between this grecting and the unstudied
attitude which I had assumed under the action of a
genuine emotion, I exclaimed: Leave me don't

disturb me—I've hit it—wait for me- stay where
you arc—I've hit it.'
“ • But what is it that you've hit?'
" • The dickens, papa Dugrand.'
“ Thercupon, I vanished to run to my mirror and
reproduce the effect which I had surprised.
“The gesture did not correspond to what had
been prescribed. It was as harmonious as it was
truc; it was nature herself who taught it to me.
“ This is what had happened:
“My arms were not extended toward the object
of my surprise, and my body was bent suddenly
backward.
“What an overthrowal of all conjectures; what a
denial of the theories of my instructors ! what argu-
ments could they invoke in the face of truth itself?
"What,' thought I, 'are my masters absolutely
ignorant of the laws of nature?'
“Returning from my cousin, whom I speedily
despatched, not without thinking of the fragility of
the heart, I gave myself up to my interrupted course
of reflections."

At this point in his story, Delsarte yields himself
up to considerations on human reason and the reason
of things, over which we will not linger, because
they belong rather to philosophic theology than to
the science of æsthetics. I confine myself to what
especially relates to art.

“I conclude that reason is blind in the matter of
principles; and from another side it is evident to me
that without this reason I could not utilize a prin-.
ciple.”
Delsarte decides that he must study the phenom-
ena of instinct to prove whether they are prescribed
by a physical or a spiritual necessity. Whence it
would result " that their motives are of supreme im-
portance." And “admitting that there exists a
material reason above and beyond human rcason,"
he sccks, without prejudice, he says, in this rcason ,
that which concerns his art; he proposes to gener-
alize its precepts, to arrange its deductions.
From this point of view he again takes up his
phrase: "Ah! how are you, papa Dugrand?", proves
that the style which instinct taught him is unques-
tionably the best, and, starting from that, he strives
to generalize by mcans of analogies. He puts ques-
tions and gives the answers.
" When does a man bow his head before the ob-
ject which strikes his eye?
“ When he considers or examines it.
“Does he never consider things with head raised?
“Yes, when he considers them with a feeling of
pride: it is thus that he rules them or cxalts them;
and also when he questions them with his glance;
in fine, when what he sces astonishes or surprises
him; but so soon as that surprise is great enough

to raise his shoulders and his arms, as by 'a galvanic
shock, the head takes an inverse direction, it sinks
and scems anxious to become solid to offer more re-
sistance to that which might attack it.
“ If the head is liſted to look at that which sur-
prises it, it is because it has no great interest in the
recognition of that which it considers; but as soon
as that interest commands it to examine, to recog-
nize, it is instantly lowered and placed in the state
of expectation.
“ Now, how docs surprise cause us to liſt our arms?
“The shoulder, in every man who is agitated or
moved, rises in exact proportion to the intensity of
his emotion.
“ It thus becomes the thermometer of the cmo-
tions. Now, the commotion that imprints a strong
impression, communicates to the arms an ascending
motion which may lift them high above the head.
" But why do not the arms, in an agrecable sur-
prise, tend toward the object of that surprise ?
“ The arm should move gently toward the ob-
jcct that it wishes to caress. Under the rapid action
of surprise, therefore, it could only injure or repel
that object.
“ This it does in affright.
“But instinct-that marvelous agent of divine
reason—in that case turns the arms away from the
object which they might injure hy the rapidity of
their sudden extension, and directs them toward
heaven, leads them to risc.

“It remains to find the justificatory reason for this
retroactive movement of the body which seems
illogical at first sight.
“In what case does the body take an inverse
direction to the object which attracts it?
“We move away from the thing which we con-
template to prove to it, doubtless, the respect and
veneration that it inspires; thus the retrograde
movement may be the sign of reverence and saluta-
tion, and moreover that the object before which it
is produced is more eminent and more worthy of
veneration.
"A salutation without moving should only occur
in the case of an cqual or an inferior.
" When a painter examines his work, he moves
away from it perceptibly.
** The picture dealer, in general, examines it
closcly and with a magnifying glass in hand; but
this direct vision is but a short and limited vision.
“The painter, by moving away, seizes by synthetic
vision the harmonious relations of the work.
“Thus," adds Dclsartc in closing his first "Episode
in the Life of a Revelator," "by a chance circum-
stance I learned how vain are the precepts dictated
by the caprice of a master without a doctrine. I
possessed facts, a thousand applications of which I
saw around me, and these applications led to new
precepts.
“Thenceforth I held the nucleus of the science
and I did not despair of forming it."

Delsartc afterward finished his remarks on the
movements of the head, and I connect them with
this episode, where they seem to me appropriately
placed. He asks:
“If contemplation or simple admiration are pro-
duced alike by the retreat or advance of the head,
in what circumstances and to what point may these
inverse attitudes be indifferently produced; or if"
(as he supposes a priori) “these attitudes recognize
two reasons for being distinct, what are those
reasons ?
"Two words, as important as they are opposite in
the sense that they determine, are discngaged:
scnsuality and tcndcrness.
“Such are the sources to which we must refer the
attitudes assumed by the head on sight of the object
considered.
"Between thesc inverse attitudes a third should
naturally be placed. It was easy for me to charac-
terize this latter: I called it colorless.
" It is entirely natural that the man who considers
an object from the point of view of the mere exam-
ination which his mind makes of it, should simply
look it in the face until that object had aroused the
movements of the soul or of the life."
Here life is equivalent to sensation, according to
the classification of the modalities of the human co

which forms the basis of Delsarte's system, and
which he calls, life, soul (or sentiment), mind.
“Whence it follows that under the impulse of the
soul or the senses the head is bent. It leans toward
the person addressed, if the spiritual side predomi-
nate; in contempt of self, the examiner bends toward
his object.
“ The head retroacts and leans in the inverse
direction, if the observer make his examination in a
wholly subjective interest.
“ Consequently I proved that there are two related
looks: that of sensuality and that of tenderness.
“ The former of these glances is addressed exclu-
sively to the form of its object; it caresses the
periphery of it, and, the better to appreciate its total-
ity, moves away from it. This is what occurs in the
retroactive attitude of the head.
• The other look, on the contrary, aiins at the
heart of things without pausing on the surface, dis-
daining all that is external. It strives to penetrate
the object to its very essence, as if to unite itself
more closely with it; it has the abandonment of con-
fidence.
• Thus, when a man presses a woman's hand, we
a
may affirm one of three things :
“He does not love her, if his head remains str ht
or simply bent in facing her.
“He loves her, tenderly, if he bows his head
obliquely toward her.

-
Finally, he loves her sensually—that is to say,
solely for her physical qualities-if, on looking at
her, he moves his head toward the shoulder which
is opposite her.
“Such are, in brief, the attitudes of the head and
the eyes, which I have qualified as sensual, color-
less, affectional.
“Henceforth I possessed completely the law of
the inclinations of the head, a law which derives
from its very complexity the fertility of its applica-
tions."
It would be wrong to suppose that Delsarte
reduced the attitudes and expressions of the head
and cye to three. From this point of departure,
from this essential number, he arrives at innumerable
combinations through the fusion of the primordial
clements.
II.
“Some time later, I again saw my worthy cousin,
the innocent cause of all my joys. He was a medi-
cal student, and came to propose a visit to the dis-
secting-room. I did not hesitate to accept; the
proposal harmonized with my desire.
"I did not go, as so many go to the morgue,
merely to see dead bodies. No; the curiosity that
impelled me and the avidity with which I pursued
the object of my study was not to be so easily sat-
isfied.

• Dead bodies only attracted me when they were
-if not dissected—at least flayed. Children break
their doll to see what there is inside ; so I, too, wanted
to see what there was in a corpse. It seemed to
me that under the mutilations which the scalpel had
inflicted on the body, I should surprise the answer
to more than onc cnigma, . . . somewhat of the
secrets of life.
“The prospect of this visit had the charm of a
pleasure party to me."
At this point Delsarte draws a gloomy picture of
the details of the dissecting-room. His brilliant
pen makes one feel all its horrors; and if we were
looking for a lesson in eloquence, I should make it
my duty to give this sketch in all its sombreness;
but I have to give here only that which specially
pertains to art, and I abstain, as far as possible, from
using preliminaries and accessories which do not
relate directly thereto.
And yet the feelings and the beliefs of the great
artist are closcly identified with his practice and his
doctrines in regard to æsthetics, and I cannot omit
the following lines, vividly impressed by the spiritu-
alistic idea which was the fundamental principle of
his science and which he regarded as the inspiration
of all great art.
“What, I say to myself, those shapeless and pu-
trifying masses have lived! They have thought, they

have loved ! .. and, who would believe it from
the horror and disgust that they inspire, they have
been loved, cherished, perhaps adored. .. Ah! if
the soul is not immortal-if so many aspirations, so
many schemes, so many hopes are to end here
what is man?
" If the mutilated bodies that lay stretched before
me filled me with sadness, they at least left a faint
hope lingering in my soul.
.
“ Amidst so many repulsive objects, the faculty
of observation to which I already owed such fruitful
remarks was not dormant in me: I had already
asked myself by what evident sign one could
recognize a recent corpse.
“ From this point of view I made a rapid explo-
ration, and I questioned the various corpses left al-
most intact; I sought in some portion of the body,
common to all, a form or a sign found in all.
“ The hand furnished me that sign and responded
fully to my question.
"I noticed, in fact, that in all these corpses
the thumb displayed a similar tendency: that of
adduction or attraction inward.
“ This was a flash of light to me. To be yet
more sure of my discovery, I examined a number
of arms severed from the trunk; they showed the
same intention; I even saw hands severed from the
forearm, and still the thumb revealed this sign.
Such persistence in the same fact could not allow of

the shadow of a doubt: I possessed the sign-lan-
guage of death.
“ I rejoiced, foreseeing the service which this dis-
covery would render upon a battle-field, for instance,
where more than one living man risks burial. I
divined, moreover, something of its artistic im-
portance."
After some reflections upon the lack of attention
displayed by those medical students who had not
noted this indication in the "symptomatics” of .
death, the observer adds:
“ There remained, in order to complete my discov-
ery and to deduce useful results from it, to verify the
symptom on the dying man. It was important for
me to know in what degree it might become mani-
fest on the approach of death.
“My wishes were gratified as if by magic, for I
was led from the school of anatomy to that of clin-
ical medicine: there a house student, a friend of my
cousin, placed me beside a dying patient, and I ex-
amined with the utmost attention the hands of the
unhappy man struggling against the clutches of
inevitable death.
" At first I made a strange remark in regard to
myself, namely that the emotion which such a sight
would have caused me under any other circum-
stances, was absolutely null at this moment; close
attention dulled all feeling in me. I then understood

the courage which may inspire the surgeon in the
discharge of his duty; and I drew from this observa-
tion dcductions of great artistic interest."
Delsarte here promises to reveal those deductions;
but I have not yet met with the essay, and I doubt
if he was ever permitted to carry out the project.
One reflection is roused in me by this visit to the
dead and dying; that is, that the artist-professor,
without a special course of studies, busied himself,
from the beginning of his career, with philosophical,
physiological and psychological questions.
Another remark is in place here: Some may re-
proach Delsarte with his imperfect knowledge of
conventional technology. The natural gifts of his
powerful intellect did but shine out the more brill-
iantly in consequence. No one can deny that it is
more difficult in such a case to create words than to
learn them; in everything, is it not creation which
denotes genius?
“Now,” resumes the narrator, “I proved that the
thumbs of the dying man contracted at first in an
almost imperceptible degree; but as the last struggle
drew near, and in the supreme efforts made by the
patient to hold fast to the life which was slipping
from him, I saw all his fingers convulsively directed
toward the palm of the hand, thus masking the
thumbs which had previously approached that centre
of convergence. Death speedily followed this crisis

and soon restored to the fingers a more normal po-
sition; but the contraction of the thumb persistently
conformed to my previous obscrvations. The pres-
ence and progress of this phenomenon in the dying
was invariably confirmed by numcrous tests which
I afterward tricd.
“ Thus, I had acquired the proof that, not only
docs the adduction of the thumb characterize death,
but that this phenomenon indicates the approach of
death in proportion to its intensity. I, therefore,
possessed the fundamental principle of a system of
scmciotics hitherto unknown to physiologists; but
this principle, already so full of interest, must be
made profitable to art."
Delsarte, once master of these ideas, made them
the base and the goal of his rescarches. In that
mental vision--an cagle glance, which pierced the
past as it embraced all the spheres of æsthetics-ho
recovered the lost impressions; he revised them,
corrected or confirmed them, by the aid of the
touchstone he had conquered. As he had become,
by this assistance, a matchless scholar, so, too, his
professorship had gained progressively a quite ex-
ceptional value, of which his exquisite art was the
most persuasive demonstration.
Listen to his words:
“A throng of pictures, which in former times I
had admired at the muscum, passed before my mind's
cye; I recalled battle-scenes where the dying and

the dead are represented; descents from the cross
where Christ is necessarily represented as dead. The
idea struck me that I would go and verify the action
of the thumb in thesc various representations of
death which the painter's fancy has given us.
“I traversed the gallery of the Louvre; but now
I was armcd with a criterion which would invest my
examination with incontestiblc authority. The ig-
norance of the fact I sought, cvcn among artists of
renown, was not long in being made apparent: all
thosc hands, where they thought they had depicted
dcath, afforded me nothing but the characteristics
of a more or less peaceful slecp. The correctness
of my criticism may be verified anywhere. I then
understood all the power, all the fertility given by
an acquaintance with the laws which regulate the
nature of man, and in how much even genius itself
may be rendered sterile by ignorance of those laws."
After certain explanations, which add nothing to
his discovery in regard to the semciotics of death,
Delsarte turns his attention to another point, or
rather to the opposite side of his problem: he wishes
to know whether certain pictures, regarded as master-
pieces by modern critics as well as by their prede-
cessors, would give him at least the characteristic
signs of life.
As usual, the artist observes, reflects, compares,
weighs and deduces, and it is in the midst of these
workings of the mind that he exclaims :

"Suddenly, struck with amazement by the daz-
zling rays of unexpected light, I asked myself whether
the criterion of death would not reveal to me, by the
law of contraries, the thermometer of life. It should
a priori, it does !
“ Still it is not here that I may be permitted to
contemplate the vital phenomena attached to the
thumb: since death is so badly rendered here, I
have strong reasons for thinking that life is no better
treated. The museum had nothing more to teach
me.”
It was at the Tuileries that Delsarte next pursued
his investigations in regard to the characteristic signs
of life. He did not stop at fashionable people, all
nearly alike from their observance of conventional
rules; he mingled with the groups of children, nurses,
maids and mothers.
" It is,” he says, “in this turbulent and affection-
ate little world, crying, shouting, howling, gesticu-
lating, jumping and dancing, all at once, that I shall
find, if ever, the solution which I scek."
In the reflections suggested to him by bringing
together the various classes of society, that note of
singularity which I have more than once remarked
in the character of Delsarte is peculiarly apparent.
In religion, he belongs to the official devotees; in
politics, we might think him drawn up under the

standard of the king; he is continually surrounded
by an elegant aristocracy, who flatter and deify
him; a sovereign-the King of Hanover-treats
him as a friend.
Well, under these circumstances, which secm
calculated to stifle every germ of democracy, or at
Icast to paralyze all plebeian impulses, he frequently
treats the great men of the earth with harshness; he
never spares them a severe lesson; he chides them
with the daring of Father Bridaine before the court
of Louis XIV.
In the present circumstances, in the midst of a
diatribe which I abridge, he dubs the people of the
court, tourists, in fact, whoever go to make up what
is now known as all Paris, "a world of idlers, false
from head to foot, living nothing but a fictitious and
unnatural life."
On the other hand, we see that he can find for the
common-place, the petty, the people of no inport-
ance, tender and benevolent words which come from
his heart; it is like a spring which flows freely,
sweeping aside all obstacles. This generous sym-
pathy which gives without expecting aught in
return, full of impctus and instinct, seems to deter-
mine the true nature of this artist.
What does the explorer find in the group toward
which he was attracted by the hope of a solution?
He shall tell us in his own words:

“I noticed nurses who were distracted and indif-
ferent to the children under their charge; in these,
the thumb was invariably drawn toward the fingers,
thus offering some resemblance to the contraction
which it manifests in death. With other nurses,
more affectionate, the fingers of the hand that held
the child were visibly parted, displaying a thumb
bent outward; but this eccentration rose to still
more startling proportions in those mothers whom
I saw cach carrying her own child; there the thumb
was bent violently, as if to embrace and clasp a
beloved being
“ Thus I was not slow to recognize that the con-
traction of the thumb is inversely proportionate, its
extension directly proportionate to the affectional ex-
altation of the life. “No doubt,' I said to myself, 'the
thumb is the thermometer of life in its extending
progression as it is of death in its contracting
progression.'
" Countless examples have confirmed this remark.
I could even, on the spot, form an idea of the de-
gree of affection felt for the children entrusted to
their care, by the women who passed before my
eyes.
“ Sometimes I would say: 'There is a servile
creature whose heart is dead to that poor child
whom she carries like an inert mass; the position of
the thumb renders that indifference evident;' again it
was a woman in whom the sources of life swelled high
at the contact with the dear treasure which she

clasped; that woman was surely a mother, the ex-
cessive opening of her thumb left no room for doubt.
“ Thus my diagnostics were invariably confirmed
by exact information, and I could see to what extent
the remarks which I had recorded, were justified; I
drew from them most interesting applications for
my special course of study."
Delsarte insists strenuously on the value of the pos-
session of his discoveries, “whose striking truth," he
affirnis, “has not been bclied by forty years of ex-
pericnce.” And he says in support of his assertion :
“Suppose I had asked the same service from
three men, and that cach had answered me with the
single word yes, accompanied by a gesture of the
hand. If one of them had let his thumb approach
the fore finger, it is plain to me that he would de-
ceive me, for his thumb thus placed tells me that he
is dead to my proposition.
“If I observe in the second a slight contraction
of the thumb, I must believe that he, although
indisposed to oblige me, will still do so from
submission.
“But if the third oppose his thumb forcibly to
the other fingers .... Oh! I can count on him,
he will not deceive me! The abduction of his
thumb tells me more in regard to his loyalty, than
all the assurances which he might give me.

. In brief, I was—thanks to my double discovery
-in possession of a law whose deductions ought to
touch the loftiest questions of science and art."

III.
Moved and delighted by his first discoveries,
Delsarte was not slow to feel that, without "a rigor-
ous order of succession," he could never reduce
them to practice. He, therefore, renewed all the
impressions already described and succeeded in for-
mulating this proposition: That “the memory pos-
sesses the strange virtue of communicating fixity to
fugitive things; in other words, permanence to
instantaneousness, actuality to the past."
Following the bent of his mind, Delsarte, on this
occasion, gave himself up to dissertations of the
philosophic order to a great extent foreign to ästhet.
ics. They were not to my mind sufficiently di-
gested and elaborated, especially in the critical article
concerning the human reason; the criticism is full
of imagery, humor, wit and spirit, if you will; but
he would probably have reconsidered it had not
death cut short this last labor. For we must not lose
sight of the fact that the studies of the artist-profes-
sor, although all connected with his earliest concep-
tions, comprised the whole extent of his life, and
that these notes date from the very year in which his
brilliant career closed.
But if I have been forced to omit matter alien to
art properly so called, I cannot deprive the reader

of details which are indirectly related to it and
which may add charm or interest to the scientific
data. Delsarte resumes as follows the story of
his retrospective elaborations:
" " It is rather to the liveliness of my recollections
than to the present observation of facts that I owe
other remarks. On retracing in my memory the
walks I had taken in the Tuileries, I was struck by
an important fact amidst the phenomena called up:
the voice of the nurse or mother, when she caressed
her child, invariably assumed the double character of
tenuity and acuteness. It was in a voice equally
sweet and high-pitched that she uttered such words
as these: •How lovely he is!'.... Smile a little
bit for mamma!' Now this caressing intonation, im-
pressed by nature upon the upper notes of all these
voices, forms a strange contrast to the direction
which all singing-teachers agree in formulating: a
direction which consists in augmenting the intensity
of the sound in direct ratio to its acuteness. Thus,
to them the entire law of vocal shades would con-
sist in augmenting progressively the sound of the
ascending phrase or scale, and diminishing in the
same proportion for a descending scale. Now
nature, by a thousand irrefutable examples, directs
us to do the contrary, that is, she prescribes a de-
crease of intensity (in music, decrescendo) propor-
tionate to the ascensional force of the sounds. I

was, therefore, fully convinced that caressing, tender
and gentle sentiments find their normal expression
in high notes."
However, struck by the objection that every error,
to gain ground, must rest upon a fraction of trath,
he asked himself upon what partial, or apparent
truth, those masters could have based the error of
their system of instruction.
And he thus explained the very real exceptions,
which may erroneously have led to the formulation
of a general law.
He first established the fact that the appellative form
in every case produões high-pitched tones of an in-
tensity proportionate to the distance, which is a
simple exception to the law; but he soon found a
more serious divergence, and what seemed to imply
a contradiction: he heard a great many nursery maids
scold their charges, bringing into play the upper
chords of their voices.
Delsarte then asked if it were not in his own mind
that uncertainty and confusion reigned; but it was
from these very contradictions themselves that
truth was to dawn upon him.
"I will knock unceasingly at the door of facts.
I will question every phenomenon!"
In fact, he pursued his criticism against himself,
and he finally arrived at the claboration which I
copy to give the key to his dialectic process.

"I then perceived that my first affirmations were
no better founded than those of the masters, whose
theories I had attacked. The truth of the matter is
that ascending progressions may arise from opposite
shades of meaning. Therefore,' said I to myself, 'it
is equally inadmissible to exclude either affirmation.'
“ The law is necessarily complex: let us bring
together, that we may seize them as a whole, both
the contrary expressions and the circumstances
:which produce them.
“Vulgar and uncultured people, as well as children,
act in regard to an ascensional progression in an in-
verse sense to well-educated, or, at any rate, affec-
tionate persons, such as mothers, fond nurses, etc.
“No example has, to my knowledge, contradicted
this remark.
“But why this difference? What are its motive
causes?
Ha!' I cried, as if struck by lightning, I've
found the law! As with the movements of the head,
sensuality and tenderness, these shades of meaning
may be traced back to two distinct sources: scnti-
mnent and passion. It is sentiment which I have
scen revealed in mothers; it is passion which we
find in uncultured persons.'”
(Judging by the whole context, the word passion,
in this case, seems to signify impulse, excitement,
vehemence.)

“Sentiment and passion, then, proceed in an
inverse way: Passion strengthens the voice in pro-
portion as it rises, and sentiment, on the contrary,
softens it in due ratio to its intensity. It was the
confusion of these different sources which caused a
momentary obscurity in my understanding."
Delsarte formulates and sums up as follows the
law of vocal proportions :
“Given a rising form, such as the ascending scale,
there will be intensitive progression when this form
should express passion (whether impulse, excite-
ment or vehemence).
"There will be, on the other hand, a diminution
of intensity where this same form is caused by sen-
timent.
“Moreover, the application of this law is subject
to quantitative expressions or shades.
"These quantitative shades or expressions result
from the greatness or littleness of the being or ob-
jects to which the sounds relate. Thus we would
not use the same tones for the words: Oh, what a
pretty little girl! . . . What a lovely little flower!'
And: Scc that nice fat peasant woman. ...
What a comfortable great house !'
“Thus, a gamut should be considered as a double
scale of proportion, according to the theory indicated
above."

quence as well as music, it is evident tha. these
formulæ are cqually applicable to the spoken phrase
and the musical phrase.
IV.
Delsarte returns to the expressions of the eye
and the movements of the head, which he calls
sensual, normal and affectional.
“ “When I found myself," he says, "the possessor
“
of this law whose triple formula is of a nature to
defy cvery objection, I sought to appropriate to
myself, before the mirror, all its applications.
“ But there arosc yet another difficulty.
“I, indeed, reproduced, and at the proper time,
the movements of the head, but they persisted in
remaining awkward and lifeless.
“What was the cause of this awkwardness and
coldness?"
The artist once more found the answer to his
question in his preoccupation itself and in the
trouble that it caused him.
"One day," he continues, "almost discouraged
by the lack of success in my researches, I sorrow-
fully said to myself: What shall I do, alas! ...
The more I labor, the less clearly I see; am I inca-

pable of reproducing nature-is the difficulty that
holds me back invincible?'"
To these torments of the investigation, to this
self-doubt which mediocrity never knows, a revealing
sign replied:
“As I uttered the preceding words, I noticed that,
under the sway of the grief which dictated them, my
shoulders were strangely lifted up, and, as then I
found myself in the attitude which I had previously
tried to render natural, the unexpected movement of
my shoulders, married to that attitude, had suddenly
impressed it with an amazing expression of justice
and truth.
"Thus I gained possession of an æsthetic fact of
the first rank."
After relating his surprise at his tardiness in find-
ing the solution of the problem in this movement,
" whose powerful and expressive character seems
fundamentally allied to the actions of the head, and
leads the head itsell," the artist, insatiable for dis-
covery, seeks an explanation of the fact which had
enlightened him.
“ Thus, I knew henceforth the necessity for move-
ments of the shoulder, but I was still ignorant of their
motive cause; and I was reluctant to be longer
ignorant I foresaw a concomitance of relations

between this movement of the shoulder and the
expression of the head."
At the risk of some repetition, and still under the
reserve and indemnity of the first rough draught,
I will give almost in extenso this last elaboration of
the unwearicd explorer of the realm of æsthetics.
Every one may notice that Jacotot, Fourier. and
many others, repeat themselves without hesitation;
it is doubtless one of the necessitics of a new thing
which, without this precaution, might slip unnoticed
over the surface of ill-prepared intellccts.
V.
The human mind seems to be short-sighted; it
repels a priori all light to which it is not accustomed
gradually, and we are fortunate when it does not
wrcak vengeance for its blindness upon the promoters
of genius who trouble its quiet. We know how the
invention of steam was received, and the recollec-
tion of Galileo's fate still lives in the memory of men.
The obstinacy of innovators in persistently return-
ing to the same pathways, in driving the plough a
hundred times through the same furrow, finds its
explanation and its excuse in this fact. It is a
means of protection which they employ by instinct,
if not by intention.
“ In this way," says Delsarte, “I managed to
form the bases of my discovery: the mothers whom

I had scen bending thcir heads over the children on
whom they gazed, thus revealed something unre-
served and touching, and the shoulder played an im-
portant part in the attitude. It was indeed from
the action of the shoulder, even more than from the
inclination of the head, that this expression of
tenderness proceeded.
• The head, in such a case, accordingly receives
its greatest sum of expression from the shoulder.
That is a fact to be noted.
“For instance, let a head-however loving we
may suppose it to be intrinsically-bend toward the
object of its contemplation, and let the shoulder
not be liſted, that head will plainly lack an air of .
vitality and warm sincerity without which it cannot
persuade us. It will lack that irresistible character of
intensity which, in itself, supposes love; in brief, it
will be lacking in love.
“Then,' I say, 'I have found in the shoulder the
agent, the centre of the manifestations of love.'
“ Yes, if in pressing a friend's hand I raise my
shoulders, I shall thereby eloquently demonstrate
all the affection with which he inspires me.
" If in looking at a woman I clasp my hands and
at the same time raise my shoulders, there is no
longer any doubt as to the feeling that attaches me
to her, and instinctively every one will say: 'He
loves her with true love;' but if, preserving the
samc attitude in the same situation, the same facial
expression, the same movement of the head, I hap-

pen to withhold the action of the shoulder, instantly
all love will disappear from my expression and
nothing will be left to that attitude but a sentiment
vague and cold as falsehood.
“Once more, then, the inclinations of the head
whose law I have previously determined, seem to
owe to the shoulder alone the affectionate meaning
that they express; but the head as I have said-
in its double inclination characterizes two kinds of
love (or rather two sources of love) which are not
to be confounded : sensuality and tenderness.
“What part, then, does the shoulder play in re-
gard to this distinction? It will be curious to deter-
mine this point. Let us see !
“ The part played by the shoulder is considerable
in tenderness, that is not to be doubted; but its rôle
scems to be less in sensuality. Thus the shoulder
generally rises less when the head retroacts than
when it advances toward the object of its contem-
plation. Why is this? Is it because scnsuality per-
tains less to love than tenderness? Has it not the
same title to rank as one of the aspects of love? In
a word, why is less demand made upon the shoulder
in one instance than in the other?
"If I do not mistake, the reason is this: love
gives more than it lays claim to receive, while sen-
suality asks continually and seeks merely the posses-
sion of its object. Love understands and loves
sacrifice; it invades the whole being; it inspires it

to bestow its entire self, and that gift admits of no
reserve.
“Sensuality, on the contrary, is essentially selfish;
far from giving itself, it pretends to appropriate and
absorb in itself the object of its desires. Sensuality
is, so to speak, but a distorted, narrow and localized
love: the body is the object of its contemplation,
and it seems to see nothing beyond.
" But love docs not stop at the body, that would
be its tomb; it crosses the limits of it, to rise to the
soul in which it is utterly absorbed. Thus love
transfigures the being by consuming its personality,
whence it comes that he who loves, no longer lives
of his own life, but the life of the being whom he
contemplates.
"Let the vulgar continually confound these two
things in their manifestations, let lovers themselves
fail to distinguish accurately between tenderness
and sensuality, for me this confusion is henceforth
forbidden, and I can from the first glance boldly
separate them, thanks to the lessons taught me by
the inflections of the head.
“But let us return to the shoulder and pursue the
action of that organ in its various manifestations.
“One thing at first amazed me, in view of the
part which I had felt I must assign to the shoulder.
Whence comes, if the designation of that role be
in conformity with truth,—whence comes the
activity so apparent, so vehement indeed, which the
shoulder displays in a movement of anger or of


## p. 107 (#346) ############################################

EPISODES IN TIIE LIFE OF A REVELATOR. 107
mere impatience? Whence comes its perfect con-
comitance of relations with moral or physical pain?
Lastly, whence comes that universal application
which I just now perceived clearly and which, until
now, I had confined to such narrow limits? But if
the clevation of the shoulder does not belong exclu-
sively to love, if, on the contrary, that movement is
met with again just as correctly associated with the
most contradictory impressions, what can it mean?
“What remains for me to specify, is the truc
meaning of the shoulders in the expression of the
passions. Their intervention in all forms of emo-
tion being proved to me, would it not seem that the
very frequency of that intervention should exclude
the possibility of assigning any particular rôle to
this agent?
Fancy my perplexity, placed face to face with
an organ infinitely expressive, but whose physiog-
nomy is mingled promiscuously with every sentiment
and every passion."
Here Delsarte applauds himself—and with good
reason for not yielding to his impatience to
publish his discoveries before they were ripe:
“Whenever any one urged me to publish,” says
he, "I invariably replied: When I am old !' Old
age has come and finds me still less disposed to
publicity 'than ever."

What he could not tell, was that death drew near
while he penned those lines, and would not permit
him to put the last touch even to the work on the
“ Episodes in the Life of a Revelator." Does it
follow that he pauscd uncertain before these
problems? No, assuredly not! Hear how he
reached the solution of that which he has just put
to us.
“How, then," he asks himself again, “ are we to
“
characterize this organ?"-He still refers to the
shoulder.—“What name shall we give to its domi-
nant rôle? How specify that supreme power outside
of which all expression ceases to exist? Is it allow-
able for me to call it nature? And if the universal
application of that agent apparently authorizes that
appellation up to a certain point, whence comes its
importance? Whence the cmpire that it cxerts over
the aspect of its congcners? Is it admissible for a
neutral agent to exert so much action upon the
totality of the forces to which it is allied?
“Assuredly not! The word ncutral, moreover, ex-
cludes the idea of action, and cven more strongly
that of predominant action which belongs surpass-
ingly to the shoulder.
"Sce in how simple a way I found the answer to
my questions: the problem, hitherto vainly pursued,
was to solve itself, in a single word: *Thermometer,'
I cried, there is an excellent word, strikingly cor-
rect . . .. is it not the solution of the puzzle? It

answers every question and makes every difficulty
disappcar!'
"The shoulder is, in fact, precisely the thermomc-
ter of passion as well as of sensibility; it is the
measure of their vehemence; it determines their
degree of heat and intensity. However, it does not
specify their nature, and it is certainly in an analo-
gous sense that the instrument known by the name
of thermometer marks the degrees of heat and cold
without specifying the nature of the weather (a
specification belonging to another instrument—thc
baromcter).
• Let us examine this point:
• The shoulder, in rising, is not called upon to
teach us whether the source of the heat or violence
which mark it, arise from love or hate. This speci-
fication docs not lie within its province; it belongs
entirely to the face, which is to the shoulder what
the barometer is to the thermometer. And it is
thus that the shoulder and the face enter into har-
monious relations to complete the passional sense
which they have to determine mutually and by dis-
tinct paths.
“Now, the shoulder is limited, in its proper do-
main, to proving, first, that the emotion expressed
by the face is or is not true. Then, afterward, to
marking, with mathematical rigor, the degrec of
intensity to which that emotion rises."
.
Delsarte sums up his study of the shoulder in the
following formula:
A


## p. 110 (#349) ############################################

110
ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
“The shoulder, in every man who is moved or
agitated, rises sensibly, his will playing no part
in the ascension; thc devclopments of this in-
voluntary act are in absolute relation of proportion
to the passional intensity whose numeric measure
they form: the shoulder may, therefore, be fitly
called the thermometer of the scnsibility."
And, as after every success, the seeker utters his
Eureka!-his cry of victory:
“God be praised,” he says, “I now possess the
semciotics of the shoulder, and thereby I hold the
criterion of the passional or sensitive powers !
“What an admirable thing," he continues, ".is
this, mechanism of the body working in the service
of the soul! With what precision it reveals the
least movements of its master! What magnificent
things it lays barc! Voluntarily or involuntarily,
everything leads to truth under the action of the
translucid light which breaks forth in the working
of each of our organs !"
After this cry of triumph, Delsarte finds yet
another scruple and falls back on his objections Не
questions whether all that he has said can be applied
-in the arts—to people very highly cultured and
polished by worldly ways. And he answers as fol-
lows, after various reasonings and reflections, which

I suppress, because they belong much more to psy-
chology and moral philosophy than to æsthetics:
“In the world people display their feelings, even
the most avowable, with great reserve; this prudence,
which paralyzes the very springs of sensitive life,
seems as if it needs must neutralize the role which
I attribute to the shoulder; and yet, in spite of con-
trary appearances, I deny that the thermometric
action of the shoulder undergoes the least alteration
in the aristocratic world; I deny explicitly that this
agent proves less expressive and, above all, less
truthful there than on the street; and that for the
following reasons:
"In the first place, we cannot reasonably suppose
very ardent passions in men who are enervated by
thc perpetual influence of an artificial socicty. Now,
here the stationary condition of the thermometer
is explained: it proves absolutely nothing against
the truth of the reports; it remains at zero to mark
a colorless medium relatively destitute of vitality.
The shoulder would violate its law if it were to risc
under such circumstances: it is, therefore, perfectly
in character here; it should be, a priori, impassive
in a negative society.
“But is the shoulder really impassive in that me-
dium which we call society?
“ Yes, in the eyes of people who are not of it, and
who. from that very fact, cannot understand the
value of certain expressions which are almost imper-

ccptible; no, to those who constitute that special
world of relations called superior.
“How many things, in fact, the shoulder reveals
by those slight oscillations unseen by ignorant per-
sons, and expressing particularly the delicate and
exquisite charm of spiritual relations! It is the law
of infinitesimal quantities.
“No, the law cannot be the same for thc exquisite
joints of a refined nature, the swift and Alexible move-
ments of an elegant organism, and the telegraphic
cvolutions clumsily executed by the torpid limbs,
ankylosed as it were by labor at once hard and
constant.
"This observation logically led me to an important
conclusion, namely, that the value or importance
of a standard is deduced expressly from the nature of
the bcing, the medium or the object to which it is ap.
plied. Of what value, for instance, could a millimeter
be when added to the stature of a man? That same
millimeter, however, added to the proportions of a
flesh-worm, would make it a colossal worm; the quan-
tity of alcohol absorbed with impunity by robust
laborers would be sufficient to ruin the health of less
strongly constituted persons. Does not a smile affect
us in different degrees, according to the lips from
which it proceeds and the being who perceives it?".
Delsarte, having quoted a goodly number of in-
stances in support of his argument, affirms still more
explicitly the proposition that-saving the specific

or numerical value of a measure or gauge which
remains unalterable-its various faces, relative or
moral, derive their importance from the media or
subjects to which it is applied.
“Here, I think," says the text, “I touch on a
universal law, a curious law, which I wish to examine
incidentally. I will then take up the objections
which may still be opposed to the thermometric
system of the shoulder.
“The foregoing study has, as it seems, established
an important fact, namely, that among the various
classes of men which make up society there is no
common standard of measure. It, therefore, appears
impossible-at first sight-to establish a harmonious
scale of relations between so many various circles.
“ However, if these circles, whatever their differ-
ences may be, were specified and sufficiently known ; if
I could, for example, judge a priori of the style and
mode of activity adapted to each class of society;
in a word, if it were possible for me to characterize
each of its classes dynamically, should I not succeed
in ascertaining a proportionate gamut or scale among
them, and thereby should I not be enabled securely
to apply the principles established above?
"Let us say, to begin with, that if each social sphere
affects a determinate character in the intensity of its
passional evolutions, it has, in consequence, its
special gamut; then, as many spheres as there are,
so many gamuts must there bc. Now, all these

gamuts taken together must form a scale of propor-
tion in virtue of which they may be characterized.
That is obvious; but the difficulty is to prove the
first mode or tonality of these gamuts.
“How are we to sct to work?
“I cut short the preliminaries to set forth, plainly
and simply, the final result of my observations."
Here ends the book which Delsarte was destined
never to complete; but the tasks which he carried
on through his entire life, the scientific truths accu-
mulated during his long term of teaching, furnish
an answer to the questions which he asks in the
imperfect text of the “ Episodes in the Life of a
Revelator." The justification of his method is found
in the numerous tables in which he has summed it
up, in the precepts gathered by his pupils and audi-
tors, in the lectures taken down in short hand or
reported for the press; in a word, in all the material
which I have used as the basis of my biographical
work.
We must not forget that the Episodes were the
historic summary of the progressive development of
a vast work, and that the author had only reached
the first steps of that summary; he went to the
fountain head when the stream was flowing freely.
If I have produced this beginning in its rough
state, and who knows if he would not blame me for
so doing?-it is because I consider it of very great
interest, to scize, I might almost say to surprise, the

movement of the springs of intellectual elaboration
in privileged organizations; to see them, moved by
a frenzy for knowledge, struggle against the unknown,
and round the reef which divides them from it, when
they cannot cross it at a bound.
It cannot be without profit for the studious youth
and even for older people, to follow these investiga-
tions of a mind and a heart so ardcntly enamoured
of truth in art. Delsarte, submitting to careful cx-
.
amination his doubts, his perplexities, his discour-
agements, his renewals of energy, his joy in the
triumph of a truth acquired, seems to me to elevato
and aggrandize, alike, his work and his personality.
Thence shines forth that morality of man which,
in his system, he figures as one of the modalities of
art as well as of being. If he was mistaken, his
errors have none the less opened a vast field for
observation; all can harvest or glean there.
It is much to be regretted that these simple cx.
planations, these primitive gropings in the dark, were
not given to us complete; they would-independ.
cntly of the literary attraction that they add to dc-
ductions naturally dry—have aided the understanding
of certain formulæ in the tables drawn out by
Delsarte, whose very conciseness may make them
obscurc.
All judgment would be premature in regard to
Delsarte before gaining a knowledge of all his works.

to astronomic discoveries.
What I think I may maintain, without temcrity,
is that Delsartc deserves to be known, and that his
discoveries in wsthetics merit serious consideration.

The international reputation and repeated editions prove conclusively that this is a stand-

public personages may learn the proper use of their respiratory and vocal organs, whereby the
ordinary talk of daily social and business life can be made more pleasing and less fatiguing.
We recommend "Gymnastics of the Voice," not alone to the actor, the preacher, the lawyer,
the public reader, the lecturer, the singer, the speech-suflerer, but to pery person.

ÆSTHETIC
PHYSICAL CULTURE.
A SELF-INSTRUCTOR FOR ALL CULTURED CIR-
CLES, AND ESPECIALLY FOR ORATORI.
CAL AND DRAMATIC ARTISTS.
By OSKAR GUTTMANN.
.
PUBLISHER'S ANNOUNCEMENT.
Like the sculptor who is to imitate truly the human form, so must man, who
desires to use his frame correctly. "lay bare its interior to his consciousness, sep-
arate the parts, etc." In short, he must gain an insight into the anatomy of his
body. Accordingly. Prof. Guttmann begins his work with “Anatomical and
Physiological Principles," which he divides into three chapters," The Iluman
Skeleton." "The Muscles," and "The Mechanism of the Limbs." “ Physical
Gymnastics" form the second part. The third, which is to be regarded as the
principal portion of the book, treats of “Esthetic Gymnastics," The Plastic
Ant." and "The Mimic Art." Four other parts are added under the titles :
“The Art of Dancing." “ The Art of Fencing," "Main Principles of Dress,'
and " Application of the Rules to Common Liſe, the Salon and the Stage."
FROM LEO KOFLER, TEACHER OF THE ART OF SINGING. NEW YORK.
[In his " The Old Italian School of Singing."'1
We have arrived now at the last expedient of a singer's good style in singing :
namely, the external denicanor of the body and the facial expression. This sub-
ject ought to engage a singer's very careful attention and study. This was,
hitherto, no easy matter. There was, to my knowledge, no work in existence
that treated this subject fully and systematically from the singer's standpoint. It
is true that in a number of books pertaining to the vocal and dramatic art, this
subject has been ventilated ; but nowhere has it received the attention it de-
serves, except at the hands of Oskar Guttmann, in his excellent work. "Esthetic
Physical Culture." He treats this subject in his own practical and philosophical
way, and I warmly commend his book to the faithful perusal of every student of
vocal and dramatic art.
FROM J. E. FROHISHER, DIRECTOR OF COLLEGE OF ORATORY AND
ACTING, NEW YORK.
I have read " .Isthetic Physical Culture " with delight. And I must say that while it is so
compact in bulk it is truly the most comprehensive work I have as yet scen upon the subject.
It is to suggestive in its myle, touching upon every desired point, leaving nothing, apparently,
mawaid, and in fact covering the entire field of westhetic movements. Similar ideas I have tried
to inculcate all my life, but perhaps in not w extended and formal a method. It is a work
that ought to be studied and practiced by every cierzyman, lawyer, actor, and clocutionist in
the land. For myself I shall try to put it into the hands of my pupils w a most excellent
guide and monitor in their work.

A BOOK FOR EVERY VOCAL STUDENT.
THE OLD ITALIAN
SCHOOL OF SINGING.
BY LEO KOFLER,
TEACHER OF THE ART OF SINGING AND CUOIR MISTER
OF ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, TRINITY PARISH,
NEIV YORK.
(From the American dro Journal.)
It is a well-known fact that the vocal profession presents a medley of various theories in
utter contradiction of each other, and to endeavor to bring system and order out of this chaus
is u Herculean task. Mr. Kotler's bowok gives abundant evidence that he pusses the necessary
qualifications for such an undertaking. It is at once apparent that he has studied all existing
systems of voice culture, and, moreover, he has sifted ihe immense amount of material with
a sharp eye, and thus he is able to present to his readers the vocal method which he has made
his own with a clearness that shows at once that he is not only a hard student and a deep
thinker, but that he possesses in no ordinary degree the power of impurting his knowledge to
others in the unust interesting and practical way.

EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF A REVELATOR. 115
movement of the springs of intellectual elaboration
in privileged organizations; to see them, moved by
a frenzy for knowledge, struggle against the unknown,
and round the reef which divides them from it, when
they cannot cross it at a bound.
It cannot be without profit for the studious youth
and even for older people, to follow these investiga-
tions of a mind and a heart so ardently enamoured
of truth in art. Delsarte, submitting to careful ex-
amination his doubts, his perplexities, his discour-
agements, his renewals of energy, his joy in the
triumph of a truth acquired, seems to me to elevato
and aggrandize, alike, his work and his personality.
Thence shines forth that morality of man which,
in his system, he figures as one of the modalities of
art as well as of being. If he was mistaken, his
errors have none the less opened a vast field for
observation; all can harvest or glean there.
l
It is much to be regretted that these simple cx-
planations, these primitive gropings in the dark, were
not given to us complete; they would-independ-
cntly of the literary attraction that they add to dc-
ductions naturally dry—have aided the understanding
of certain formulæ in the tables drawn out by
Delsarte, whose very conciseness may make them
obscurc.
All judgment would be premature in regard to
Delsarte before gaining a knowledge of all his works.
I have striven to give at least their broad outlines in
those chapters of my book entitled “The Bases of

ture of truth and error in his affirmations, is true of
all science in its dawn. And if there remain lacunce
to be filled up, we must remember that Newton him.
self is far from having uttered the final word in regard
to astronomic discoveries.
What I think I may maintain, without temcrity,
is that Delsarte deserves to be known, and that his
discoveries in wsthetics merit serious consideration.

GYMNASTICS OF THE VOICE.
A SYSTEM OF CORRECT BREATHING
-IN-
SINGING AND SPEAKING,
BASED UPON PITYSIOLOGICAL LAWS.
A Self-instructor in the Training and Use of the Singing and
Speaking Voice.
By OSKAR GUTTMANN,
Professor of Æsthetic Culture, Oratory, Dramatic Reading and Acting; Author
of "Æsthetic Physical Cullure," "Talent and School," etc.
SPECIMEN TESTIMONIALS.
(From Richard Lewis, Professor of Oratory at Toronto, Canada.)
I am delighted with it. It will be of the highest value to me as an instructor, as it supe
plies me with so many useful and thoroughly practical suggestions and exercises in my work.
I have read many works on the subject,
but Oskar Guttmann's is the most suggestive and prac-
tical I have yet met with.
(From John G. Parkhurst, Teacher of Voca! Culture, Musical Conductor, etc., Albany, N. Y.]
"Gymnastics of the Voice" should be in the hands of every Vocal Student.
(From Mrs. M. Stevens Hart, Teacher of Elocution, Washington, D. C.)
I regard "Gymnastics of the Voice" as the most practical treatise on breathing I have
ever mei, and shall urge my pupils to study and digest its contents,
(From J: W. Rusk, Principal of the Rusk School of Elocution, Cleveland, Ohio.
I have critically examined "Gymnastics of the Voice," by Oskar Guttmann, and ind it
one of the best works on the subject I have ever read. Everything in it is thoroughly practie
cal. Every one interested in the culture of the voice should have a copy.
(From Leo Kofler, Teacher of the Art of Singing, Author of "The Old Italian School of
Singing," etc., New York.)
I know of but one writer who has given his full attention to this important subject. I refer
to Oskar Guttmann, who, to my knowledge, is the first and only one of the vocal profession
who has advanced as yet in print a theoretical and practical system of exhalation.
Guttmann's mcrit is indisputable, and I thankfully acknowledge that from him and his book.
"Gymnastics of the Voice," I have received the impulse, as well as a great many valuable
suggestions, for my system of the practice of exhaling or muscle-relaxation in singing,
(From J. N. Brown, Professor of Elocution, Trenton, N. j.,
I have read "Gymnastics of the Voice with great pleasure and profit. Experience has
proved it the only logical and natural method.
(From The Voice, Albany, N. Y.)
The international reputation and repeated editions prove conclusively that this is a stand-
ard work which has stood the test of practical experience and of recent scientific advance
ment. By its teachings men and women have von distinction and prolonged their carcer in
the pulpit, on the stage and on the rostrum. By its teachings primair individuals as well as
public personages may learn the proper use of their respiratory and vocal organs, whereby the
ordinary talk of daily social and business life can be made more pleasing and less fatiguing.
We recommend "Gymnastics of the Voice," not alone to the actor, the preacher, the lawyer,
the public reader, the lecturer, the singer, thc speech-sufferer, but to very person.
(From the Staats-Zeitung, New York, the leading German-American paper.
Oskar Guttmann, already known to our readers as the author of "#sthetic Physical Cul.
ture," has for years labored with brilliant results in the domain of vocal culture-musical,
dramatic and elocutionary -as is proved by a fourth edition of his "Gymnastics of the
Voice," which first appeared in Germany in 1860. At the time it was a pioneer book, but i
has now become, through repeated editions, enlarged and improved by extended experience
and scientific progress, truly a standard work. Never before han any professional write
treated the respiratory functions in speaking and singing with such ability and thorougbaem
combined with practical direction for overcoming laulu and acquiring skill.

of "Æsthetic Physical Culture," "Talent and School," etc.
SPECIMEN TESTIMONIALS.
(From Richard Lewis, Professor of Oratory at Toronto, Canada.)
I am delighted with it. It will be of the highest value to me as an instructor, as it sup
plies me with so many useful and thoroughly practical suggestions and exercises in my work.
I have read many works on the subject, but Oskar Guttmann's is the most suggestive and prac-
tical I have yet met with.
(From John G. Parkhurst, Teacher of Vocal Culture, Musical Conductor, etc., Albany, N. Y.)
Gymnastics of the Voice " should be in the hands of every Vocal Student.
(From Mrs. M. Stevens Hart, Teacher of Elocution, Washington, D. C.)
I regard " Gymnastics of the Voice" as the most practical treatise on breathing I have
ever met, and shall urge my pupils to study and digest its contents.
(From J. W. Rusk, Principal of the Rusk School of Elocution, Cleveland, Ohio. 1
I have critically examined "Gymnastics of the Voice," by Oskar Guttmann, and find it
one of the best works on the subject I have ever read. Everything in it is thoroughly practi.
cal. Every one interested in the culture of the voice should have a copy.
(From Leo Koller, Teacher of the Art of Singing, Author of " The Old Italian School of
Singing," etc., New York.)
I know of but one writer who has given his full attention to this important subject. I reier
to Oskar Guttmann, who, to my knowledge, is the prst and only one of the vocal profession
who has advanced as yet in print a theoretical and practical system of exhalation.
Guttmann's mcrit is indisputable, and I thankfully acknowledge that from him and his book,
"Gymnastics of the Voice," ! have received the impulse, as well as a great many valuable
suggestions, for my system of the practice of exhaling or muscle-relaxation in singing.
[From J. N. Brown, Professor of Elocution, Trenton, N.;.,
I have read • Gymnastics of the Voice" with great pleasure and profit. Experience has
proved is the only logical and natural method.
(From The Voice, Albany, N. Y.)
The international reputation and repeated editions prove conclusively that this is a stand-
ard work which has stood the test of practical experience and of recent scientific advance.
ment. By its teachings men and women have won distinction and prolonged their career is
the pulpit, on the stage and on the rostrum. By its teachings privair individuals as well as
public personages may learn the proper use of their respiratory and vocal organs, whereby the
ordinary talk of daily social and business life can be made more pleasing and les fatiguing.
We recommend "Gymnastics of the Voice," not alone to the actor, the preacher, the lawyer,
the public reader, the lecturer, the singer, the specch-suflerer, but to cuery person.
(From the Staats-Zeitung, New York, the leading German-American paper.)
Oskar Guttmann, already known to our readers as the author of "* Æsthetic Physical Cui.
ture,
," has for years labored with brilliant results in the domain of vocal culture-musical,
dramatic and elocutionary-as is proved by a fourth edition of his "Gymnastics of the
Voice," which first appeared in Germany in 1860. At the time it was a pioneer book, but i
has now become, through repeated editions, enlarged and improved by extended experience
and scientific progress, truly a standard work. Never before has any professional writes
treated the respiratory functions in speaking and singing with such ability and thoroughack
combined with practical direction for overcoming faulu and acquiring skill.

ÆSTHETIC
PHYSICAL CULTURE.
A SELF-INSTRUCTOR FOR ALL CULTURED CIR.
CLES, AND ESPECIALLY FOR ORATORI.
CAL AND DRAMATIC ARTISTS.
By OSKAR GUTTMANN.
PUBLISHER'S ANNOUNCEMENT.
1.ike the sculptor who is to imitate truly the human form, so must man, who
desires to use his frame correctly. "lay bare its interior to his consciousness, sep-
arate the parts, etc." In short, he must gain an insight into the anatomy of his
body. Accordingly, Prof. Guttmann begins his work with “Anatomical and
Physiological Principles," which he divides into three chapters, —"The Human
Skeleton." "The Muscles," and “ The Mechanism of the Limbs." “ Physical
Gymnastics " form the second part. The third, which is to be regarded as the
principal portion of the book, treats of " Æsthetic Gymnastics," * The Plastic
Ant." and " The Miinic Art." Four other parts are added under the titles :
“The Art of Dancing." " The Art of Fencing." "Main Principles of Dress,"
and " Application of the Rules to Common Liſe, the Salon and the Stage."
FROM LEO KOFLER, TEACHER OF THE ART OF SINGING, NEW YORK.
[In his " The Old Italian School of Singing.")
We have arrived now at the last expedient of a singer's good style in singing :
namely, the external demeanor of the body and the facial expression. This sub-
ject ought to engage a singer's very careful attention and study. This was,
hitherto, no easy matter. There was, to my knowledge, no work in existence
that treated this subject fully and systematically from the singer's standpoint. It
is true that in a number of books pertaining to the vocal and dramatic art, this
subject has been ventilated ; but nowhere has it received the attention it de.
serres, except at the hands of Oskar Guttmann, in his excellent work. “Esthetic
Physical Culture." He treats this subject in his own practical and philosophical
way, and I warmly commend his book to the faithful perusal of every student of
vocal and dramatic art.
FROM J. E. FROHISHEK, DIRECTOR OF COLLEGE OF ORATORY AND
ACTING, NEW YORK.
I hare read " .Isthetic Physical Culture " with delight. And I must say that while it is so
capact in bulk it is truly the most comprehensive work I have as yet men upon the subject.
ks suggestive in its style, touching upon every desired point, Icaving nothing, apparently,
wid, and in fact covering the entire field of ästhetic movements. Similar ideas I have tried
to inculcate all my life, but perhaps in not so extended and formal a method. It is a work
that ought to be studied and practiced by every clergyman, lawyer, actor, and elocutionist in
the land. For myself I shall try to put it into the hands of my pupils u e most excellent
Guide and monitur in their work.

A BOOK FOR EVERY VOCAL STUDENT.
THE OLD ITALIAN
SCHOOL OF SINGING.
BY LEO KOFLER.
TEACHER OF THE ART OF SINGING AND CHOIR MASTER
OF ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, TRINITY PAR/SII.
NEIV YORK.
(From the American Arl Journal.)
It is a well-known fact that the vocal profession presents a medley of various theories in
ulter contradiction of each other, and to endeavor to bring system and order out of this chauss
is a Herculean task. Mr. Koller's bowok gives abundant evidence that he possesses the necesury
qualifications for such an undertaking.li is at once apparent that he has studied all existing
systems of voice culture, and, moreover, he has sifted ihe immense amount of material with
a sharp eye, and thus he is able to present to his readers the vocal method which he has made
his own with a clearness that shows at once that he is not only is hard student and a deep
thinker, but that he possesses in no ordinary degree the power of impurting his knowledge to
others in the inost interesting and practical way.
