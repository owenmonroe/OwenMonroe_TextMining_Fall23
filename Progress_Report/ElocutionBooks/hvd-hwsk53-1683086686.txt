PREFACE.
THIS little Work is designed to comprise the most valuable and practically-useful observ-
ations of the best writers on Elocution, together with the Compiler's own experience.
Many works are exceedingly diffuse and mechanical in their rules, while on various
points authors differ materially. Several devote many pages to rules for the inflections
of the voice, while Dr. Comstock observes, that "most of these rules are better calculated
to make bad readers than good ones. Those founded on the construction of sentences
might, perhaps, do credit to a mechanic, but they certainly do none to an elocutionist."
The subject is of such a nature, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to give rules
for the regulation of all the inflections of the voice in reading and speaking. Even
Walker, speaking of inflection, says, "The sanguine expectations I had once entertained,
that this analysis of the human voice would be received by the learned with avidity and
applause, are now over. I have almost worn out a long life in laborious exertions; and,
though I have succeeded beyond expectation in forming readers and speakers in the most
respectable circles in the three kingdoms, yet I have had the mortification to find few of
my pupils listen to anything but my pronunciation. When I have explained to them
the five modifications of the voice, they have assented and admired; but so difficult did
it appear to adopt them-especially to those advanced in life-that I was generally
obliged to follow the old method (if it may be called so), 'read as I read,' without any
reason for it." The "Chironomia" of the Rev. Gilbert Austin, containing 600 quarto
pages, gives the most minute directions for action, and Dr. Comstock devotes many pages
to that branch; while G. Vandenhoff says, "It is next to impossible to teach gesture by
written instructions. Three practical lessons, with a good and experienced professor,
will do more towards giving the pupil ease, grace, and force of action, than all the books
and plates in the world." Several writers give copious exercises on the elemental sounds,
but differ as to the number of such sounds; Sheridan giving 51; Herries, 29; Smart, 39;
Cull, 43; Dr. Rush, 35; and Dr. Comstock, 38. Attempts have even been made to
direct the delivery by a kind of musical notes. The author of "An Essay on the Art of
Delivering Written Language," justly observes, "The essential and chief difference be-
tween the tones used in speaking and singing lies in the latter being carried on by dis-
tinct intervals of some continuance, that will harmonize with other accompanying sounds;
while the former is, in general, made up of such minute and evanescent variations and
inflections of voice, as could not possibly have a place in any scale of practical music what-
ever. That the ancients had marks for their gesture in reciting and declamation of the
theatre is notorious; but, like their modulation, it was greatly heightened above nature,
full of instituted signs, and even so violent as to require a man's whole strength. Hence
it might be taught in a manner similar to the steps and movements of dancing; while
ours, from being very little varied, seldom marked with anything violent, and copied
chiefly after nature, does not seem either to require or admit of being reduced to the
formal rules of science;" and that "in the application of such delicate transitions of
voice, and slightly characterized formulas, as those marks must represent, it is probable
there would arise a stiffness and want of address, which would more than counterbalance
any of their good effects." Some idea of the difficulty or impossibility of realizing such
a scheme may be formed from the simple fact, that Dr. Rush has actually enumerated
180 out of probably several hundreds of what he styles the "waves" of the voice. Our
greatest orators and actors have availed themselves of the observations of the judicious,
and studied and practised much; but certainly never went through a course of mecha-
nical exercises.

HINTS ON ELOCUTION.
THE human voice is made by the passage of air through the larynx and
cavities of the mouth and nose. Various explanations have been given
of the formation of its various modifications as to pitch and tone; but as
the organs supposed to produce them cannot be examined in their per-
fect state, the precise formation is still unknown.
Every one has what may be called his natural voice, which differs from
that of every other individual. This natural voice can be wonderfully
improved and strengthened; its unpleasant peculiarities removed or
softened, and its good qualities fully developed by careful and persever-
ing practice. Improve your own natural voice as much as possible, but
do not attempt to acquire an artificial one. Read aloud and observe
how you form those tones, which your judgment, after some practice,
will tell you are natural to the language.
In order to produce a good voice, and to speak with ease, keep erect,
but not perpendicular, whether you stand or sit. The chest must be
expanded and projected, but not in a constrained manner; the shoulders
depressed and thrown back; the mouth must be well opened by lowering
the under jaw, but without distorting the features.
If the mouth be not
sufficiently opened, the voice will not have full power; if too much, the
features will be distorted; and in either case the articulation and tone
will be injured. Occasionally, practise before a mirror.
Conversational dialogues and dramatic scenes are effective means of
breaking up monotonous and mechanical tones, and are of great service
in facilitating the acquisition of an appropriate style of delivery.
Learn to read one part well; then another; then all, modulating the
voice for the different characters.
Avoid all nostrums for "improving the voice." Many are highly in-
jurious, containing opium or other deleterious drugs; and although they
may at first appear to improve the voice, they will ultimately and per-
manently injure it. Exercise and temperance are the only sure strength-
eners. Whatever improves the general state of the health will equally
improve the vocal organs. Practise with moderation, and rest before the
voice becomes fatigued. Do not load the stomach before speaking. Dis-
tinguish between force, and violence, which is excess of force. The
latter will injure the health, voice, and articulation, cause distortion of
the features, and produce rant. Cravats should not be thick, as such
weaken the vocal organs, nor worn so tight as to impede their action.
But avoid a slovenly looseness. Snuff is very injurious to the voice.
"The middle pitch ought to be generally used, for two reasons; first,
because the organs of the voice are stronger, and more pliable in this
pitch, from constant use; and secondly, because it is more easy to rise
or fall from that pitch, to high or low, with regular proportion. Most

persons, through want of skill and practice, when they read or speak in
public, fall into one of the extremes. Either through timidity and diffi-
dence they use the low pitch, in which they are not heard at all, or with
so much trouble to the listener, as soon to weary attention; or if they
aim at avoiding this fault, they run into the high pitch; which is produc-
tive of consequences equally bad. The organs of the voice, in this
unusual pitch, are soon wearied, and languor and hoarseness ensue. And
as the reason for continuing it, will be equally strong during the whole
discourse, as for the first setting out in it, the speaker must lose all the
benefits which arise from variety, and fall into a disgusting monotony.
The prevalence of this practice arises from a common mistake in those
who speak for the first time in a large room, and before a numerous
auditory. They conclude it impossible that they should be heard in
their common pitch of voice, and therefore change it to a higher. Thus
they confound two very different things, making high and low, the same
with loud and soft. Loud and soft in speaking, like the forte and
piano in music, only refer to the different degrees of force used in the
same key: whereas high and low imply a change of key. A man may
speak louder or softer in the same key; when he speaks higher or lower,
he changes his key. So that the business of every one is to proportion
the force or loudness of voice to the room, and number of his auditory,
in its usual pitch. If it be larger than ordinary, he is to speak louder,
not higher, in his usual key, not in a new one. And whoever neglects
this, will never be able to manage his voice with ease to himself, or plea-
sure to his hearers."-SHERIDAN'S Elocution.
We can raise our voice at pleasure to any pitch it is capable of; but
it requires great art and practice to bring the voice lower when it is
once raised too high. It ought therefore to be a first principle rather to
begin under the common level of the voice than above it.
Any one naturally weak in voice, or who, through habit, has fallen
into a weak utterance, cannot hope suddenly to change it; he must do it
by degrees and constant practice. He should daily exercise himself in
reading or speaking, and if possible, in a large room, gradually increasing
the power; for the method of increasing by degrees is easy in this as in
everything else, when sudden transitions are impracticable; and every
new acquisition of power enables him the better to go on to the next de-
gree. When he has attained that loudness, beyond which he cannot go
without straining, and forcing his voice, there let him stop, and in that,
or a little under that degree, let him practice for some time, but not until
fatigued. When he is able to manage his voice in that degree, he will
certainly be able to command it in all the inferior degrees, though, for
the more gradual unfolding of the organs, and regular increase of the
quantity of the voice, he should begin each day's exercise with the lowest
degree, and gradually increase it till he arrives at the utmost. The
middle pitch of the voice should first be strengthened, then the lower and
higher pitches. The speaker must take particular care not to raise the
pitch of the voice, but only to add power. Those who have the oppor-
tunity should practise in the open air, or on the sea-shore, and with the
face to the wind. When the voice has acquired considerable power, the
student should occasionally speak aloud while walking up an ascent.
Great attention should be given to the cultivation of the lower notes of
the voice. Few can use them with distinctness. The whisper of
Mrs. Siddons was distinctly heard in the remotest parts of huge theatres,

and produced a greater effect than the loudest bawl of those who
passions to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings."
Although the higher notes are not so often required as the middle or
lower, they must be perfectly under command. Nothing can be worse
in a public speaker than the breaking, or changing, of his "big manly
voice" to a "childish treble," when it should rouse like a trumpet.
When the voice grows thin, or approaches to a squeak upon a high note,
swell the voice a little below this high note, and give it force and audi-
bility by throwing it into a sameness of tone approaching a monotone.
Proportion the loudness of your voice to the size and peculiarities of
the place, so that you neither fatigue yourself, and annoy your audience
by unnecessary loudness, nor remain unheard by many, by using too
little. In echoing buildings, be very distinct and slow; make frequent
and long pauses; be as smooth as possible; use little force, and attend
to the returning sound. Study the peculiarities of the place in which
you have to speak, either by practising there, or observing another orator,
and from different parts.

"A public speaker, possessed of only a moderate voice, if he articulates
correctly, will be better understood, and heard with greater pleasure, than
one who vociferates without judgment. The voice of the latter may in-
deed extend to a considerable distance, but the sound is dissipated in
confusion. Of the former voice not the smallest vibration is wasted;
every stroke is perceived at the utmost distance to which it reaches; and
hence it has often the appearance of penetrating even farther than one
which is loud, but badly articulated.
"In just articulation, the words are not to be hurried over, nor precipi-
tated syllable over syllable; nor, as it were, melted together into a mass
of confusion they should not be trailed, or drawled, nor permitted to
slip out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They should be delivered
from the lips as beautiful coins newly issued from the Mint, deeply and
accurately impressed, neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, in due
succession, and of due weight."-AUSTIN's Chironomia.
"I dare boldly affirm, that of the multitude of instances which offer, of a
vitiated articulation, there is not one in a thousand which proceeds from
any natural defect or impediment. Of this point, I had many proofs in
the school where I received my first rudiments of learning, and where the
master made pronunciation a chief object of his attention; in which I
never knew a single instance of his failing to cure such boys as came to
him with any defects of that kind; though there were numbers, who
lisped or stuttered to a great degree, on their first entrance into the
school; or who were utterly unable to pronounce some letters, and others
very indistinctly. When Demosthenes first spoke in public, it was
objected to him that he could not even pronounce the first letter of his
art, rhetoric; and to this day people are told that this was a natural
defect in his organs; but had that been the case, it would have been
impossible that he should have ever got the better of it; which we are
told he did, by indefatigable pains, even a long time after he had arrived
at the age of manhood. So that it was clearly owing to early bad habit;
and to the want of due pains, in correcting it in time.
And indeed we
are also told, that through the avarice of his guardians, this customary,
and, as it was then thought, necessary branch of education had been
omitted. The letter R is very indistinctly pronounced by many; nay, in
several of the northern counties of England, there are scarce any of the

inhabitants, who can pronounce it at all. Yet it would be strange
to suppose, that all those people, should be so unfortunately distinguished,
from the rest of the natives of this island, as to be born with any pecu-
liar defect in their organs; when the matter is so plainly to be accounted
for, upon the principle of imitation, and habit. The example of this
prince of orators, affords the highest encouragement to all who labour
under imperfections of speech, to endeavour their cure; as by diligence,
and using proper means, they have reason to expect success. For,
perhaps, there was not any one of his age, who laboured under so many
defects in that way, even after he had advanced several years in manhood;
and yet he not only got the better of all those, but arrived at such a
pitch of exactness, delicacy, and power of delivery, as soon threw all
competitors at a distance; though elocution had arrived at such perfection
in his days, that it might justly be called the age of orators. And all
this, as we are informed, was chiefly accomplished by his own labour and
assiduity.
"Parents do not think it necessary to assist their infants, in their first
attempts to articulate words; or to make them proceed regularly, in the
formation of such sounds only, as are most easy, and require least exer-
tion of the organs; but by suffering them to try to pronounce any words
whatever, or even often urging them to speak such as are too difficult,
they give a wrong bias to their weak, tender organs, which it would
require much pains to set right. Hence often arises stuttering, lisping,
and a total inability to pronounce certain letters. The child being urged
to utter a sound which he finds either difficult or impossible, of course
hesitates, or substitutes another letter of more easy pronunciation in the
room; or wholly omits it, and only pronounces the remaining letters of
the word; and this he afterwards does habitually, never using any endea-
vours of his own to alter a pronunciation which he finds easy to him-
self. The parent, by being accustomed to it, understands perfectly the
child's meaning, in this faulty manner of pronouncing it; and too often,
far from endeavouring to correct it, encourages him to proceed in it, by
talking to him in his own childish way; for which he acquires a sort of
fondness, accounting the blemish a prettiness."-SHERIDAN'S Elocution.
Writers on elocution have frequently attempted to describe the forma-
tion of the various articulate sounds, for the benefit of those whose arti-
culation is imperfect; but it is almost impossible to clearly describe the
formation by words, and engravings show but a part of the process. The
best method of correcting defective speech, when not arising from organic
defect, is to exercise the pupil before a mirror, that he may observe the
contrast between the movements of his own mouth, and those of the
master. This practice will also be found highly beneficial to persons
learning to sing, or the pronunciation of foreign languages. Defective
articulation frequently arises from endeavouring to speak too fast. Time
is not given for the organs to form the correct sounds, and habit confirms
the false. Children ought not to be allowed to repeat their lessons in a
hurried manner, either while committing them to memory, or repeating
them to the teacher. Mrs. Siddons's first direction to her pupils was,
"Take time."
The best method of correcting or preventing careless articulation, is to
repeat a few words daily, loudly and distinctly, taking them promis-
cuously from your reading lesson, and attending wholly to pronouncing
them well, without any regard to the context. If you pronounce any


## p. 7 (#15) ###############################################

7
particular sound amiss, let words containing it predominate, but do not
utter too many of these successively. Speak the words in various pitches,
tones, rates of utterance, and degrees of force.
"Smart's Pronouncing Dictionary," entitled "Walker Remodelled," is
considered the best. It reconciles custom, as far as possible to itself,
and to the analogies and tendencies of the English language. The
"Principles of Pronunciation " prefixed to the octavo edition must be
carefully read, to understand the work. Write down all the words you
are in the habit of mispronouncing, and read them over two or three
times daily until corrected. After a time read over the list again to
ascertain whether the correct pronunciation has been acquired.
"Stammerers, instead of speaking immediately after inspiration, as
they should do, often attempt to speak immediately after expiration,
when, of course, they have no power to speak. The lungs, like a
bellows, perform their part in the process of speaking, best, when plenti-
fully supplied with air. This is an important fact, and should be
remembered, not only by stammerers, but also by those who have occa-
sion to read or speak in public. Loud speaking, long-continued, with
the lungs but partially distended, is very injurious to these organs: it is
apt to occasion a spitting of blood, which is not unfrequently a precursor
of pulmonary consumption. But loud speaking, with proper manage-
ment of the breath, is a healthful exercise: besides strengthening the
muscles which it calls into action, it promotes the decarbonization of the
blood, and consequently exerts a salutary influence on the system gene-
rally."-DR. COMSTOCK. Dr. Turner, of Newark, New Jersey, says :-
'Stammering is caused by attempting to speak with empty lungs. In
singing, the lungs are kept well inflated, and there is no stuttering. The
method of cure is, to keep the lungs well filled-to draw frequent long
breaths, to speak loud, and to pause on the instant of finding embarass-
ment in the speech, taking a long inspiration before you go on again. I
cured one of the worst cases I ever knew on this principle."
"Consonants should not be preceded by any confused sound of their own.
The not attending to this in pronouncing the letter s, has been the chief
cause of our language being called by foreigners the hissing language,
though, in reality, it does not abound so much in that letter as either the
Greek or the Roman; the final s, with us, having, for the most part, the
sound of z. But if care be not taken early in forming the pronunciation,
people are apt to contract a habit of hissing before they utter the sound
of s, at the beginning of syllables, as well as of continuing it at the end.
Expression does not reside in the mere letters which compose the words;
it depends on the due force given to them in utterance. No letter so
harsh, which may not be softened; so strong, which may not be weakened;
and vice versa. The long may be shortened, and the short lengthened.
And all this depends upon the management of the voice. Whenever the
power of the consonants is particularly suited to the expression, their
sound should be enforced; when otherwise, softened."-SHERIDAN'S Art
of Reading.
66
66 All persons who pronounce English words properly, of course lay
the accent right, as that is part of pronunciation; and never fail to do so
in conversation. But many, when they come to read or speak in public,
transgress the rules of accent. This arises from a mistaken notion in
some, that words are rendered more distinct to a large assembly, by


## p. 8 (#16) ###############################################

'dwelling longer upon the syllables which compose them; and in others,
that it adds to the pomp and solemnity of public declamation, in which
they think everything ought to be different from private discourse.
This has been chiefly the vice of the stage, and has principally given rise
to the distinction of what is commonly called theatrical declamation, in
opposition to that of the natural kind; into an imitation of which many
public speakers have been betrayed, and their manner, called on that
account, theatrical. Upon examination, it ld appear, that it arises
chiefly from their dwelling upon syllables that are unaccented, through a
notion that it makes the words move more slow, stately, and uniform,
than the quicker and more spirited accents will allow. This was a fault
which Shakspeare complained of in his time, and which has not been
thoroughly amended since; though there have been some late efforts
towards it, and some progress made in it. The passage alluded to in
Shakspeare, is in the advice given to the player by Hamlet; where, in
laying down rules for a just delivery, he says, 'Speak the speech, I pray
you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you
mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier had
spoke my lines.' By 'trippingly on the tongue,' he means the bounding
from accent to accent; tripping along from word to word, without resting
on syllables by the way, And by mouthing, is meant, dwelling upon
syllables that have no accent, and ought therefore to be uttered as quickly
as is consistent with distinct articulation; or prolonging the sounds of
the accented syllables beyond their due proportion of time."-SHERIDAN'S
Elocution.
Not half the pauses are found in printing which are heard in the
pronunciation of a good reader or speaker. If we would read or speak
easily and well, we must pause, upon an average, at every fifth or sixth
word. Take a little breath at almost every pause.
Breathe quietly,
almost imperceptibly. Avoid gasping and puffing. "No precise rules
of universal, or even, perhaps, of general application, can be laid down
for the management of the pause. There are, however, two principles
founded in nature, which are ever to be observed. The first is, that
pause should ever be proportioned to quantity. As longer quantity is
given, the pauses between the words, and, particularly, between
the logical words, or different thoughts, should be lengthened. It is
a common fault, that in the endeavour, to be more deliberate or
slow, in the pronunciation, the pauses only, or the quantity only, is
lengthened. The second is, that words should be separated by longer
pauses than the syllables of the same word; and groups of words
expressing single thoughts, than the single words composing those groups.
Such groups of words, or, as they may be called, rhetorical words, should
always be insulated, by distinct pauses, unless it is important to intimate
a peculiar intimacy of relation between them. Still further, dependent
propositions should be more separated by pauses, than logical words;
complete sentences, than such subordinate propositions; and complete
trains of thought, than sentences."-DAY's Elocution.
"As those classes of words which admit of no separation are very
small and very few, if we do but take the opportunity of pausing where
the sense will permit, we shall never be obliged to break in upon the
sense when we find ourselves under the necessity of pausing; but if we
overshoot ourselves by pronouncing more in a breath than is necessary,


## p. 9 (#17) ###############################################

9
and neglecting those intervals where we may pause conveniently, we
shall often find ourselves obliged to pause where the sense is not sepa
rable, and, consequently, to weaken and obscure the composition.
"In pausing, ever let this rule take place,
Never to separate words in any case
That are less separable than those you join:
And which imports the same, not to combine
Such words together, as do not relate
So closely as the words you separate."-WALKER'S Elocution.
Great force may be given by pausing before, and concentrating the
voice on, an important word. A succession of pauses and concentrations
each increasing in force to a climax is exceedingly effective, but must be
used sparingly, and only in highly-wrought passion.
"There is no article, in which more frequent mistakes are committed,
than in this important one of emphasis, both with regard to stress and tone.
The chief reason of this general abuse of emphasis, seems to be, that
children are taught to read sentences, which they do not understand; and
as it is impossible to lay the emphasis right, without perfectly compre-
hending the meaning of what one reads, they get a habit of reading in a
monotone, or if they attempt to distinguish one word from the rest, as
the emphasis falls at random, the sense is usually perverted, or changed
into nonsense. The way to prevent this, is, to put no book into their
hands, which is not suited to their slender capacities; and to take care
that they never read anything whose meaning they do not fully compre-
hend." SHERIDAN'S Art of Reading.
"The necessity of observing propriety of emphasis is so great, that the
true meaning of words cannot be conveyed without it. For the same
individual words, ranged in the same order, may have several different
meanings, according to the placing of the emphasis. Thus, to use a trite
instance, the following sentence may have as many different meanings, as
there are words in it, by varying the emphasis.
'Shall you ride to town
to-morrow?' If the emphasis is on shall, it implies, that the person
spoken to, has expressed before, such an intention, but that there is some
doubt in the questioner, whether he be determined on it or not, and the
answer may be, Certainly, or, I am not sure. If it be on you, the
question implies that some one is to go, and do you mean to go yourself,
or send some one in your stead? And the answer may be, No, but my
servant shall. If on ride, the answer may be, No, I shall walk, or go in
a coach. If on town, the answer may be, No, but I shall ride to the
forest. If on to-morrow, the answer may be, No, not to-morrow, but the
next day."-SHERIDAN'S Elocution.
Paraphrasing or drawing out the signification of emphatic words, or
changing the word we are accustomed to emphasize to another of the
same import is the best guide where the sense is not quite clear. Avoid
multiplying emphatical words too much. It is only by a prudent
reserve in the use of them, that we can give them any weight. If they
recur too often; if a speaker attempts to render everything which he
says of importance, by emphasis, we soon learn to pay little regard to
them. The same applies to action.
Emphasis requires a transposition of accent "when two words which
have a sameness in part of their formation, are opposed to each other in
sense. Thus, if I pronounce the words justice and injustice as single


## p. 10 (#18) ##############################################

10
words, I naturally place the accent on the penultimate syllable of both;
but if I contrast them, and say, Neither justice nor injustice have anything
to do with the present question; in this sentence I naturally place the
accent on the first syllable of injustice, in order the more forcibly and
clearly to distinguish it from justice. This transposition of the accent,
which is so evidently dictated by the sense, extends itself to all words
which have a sameness of termination, though they may not be directly
opposite in sense; thus, if I wanted more particularly to show that I
meant one requisite of dramatic story rather than another, I should say,
In this species of composition, plausibility is much more essential than
probability; and in the pronunciation of these words, I should infallibly
transpose the accent of both, from the third to the first syllables; in
order to contrast those parts of the words which are distinguished from
each other by the import of the sentence."-WALKER'S Elocution.
Read verse as you would prose, avoiding all sing-song, and dwelling
upon rhymes. Let every syllable have the same accent, and emphasize
the same words, as in prose. The accent may be changed when the
ear would be more disgusted with the harshness of the verse, if the right
accent were preserved, than with a wrong accent which preserves the
melody of the verse. Where a word admits of some diversity in placing
the accent, the verse ought to decide; but when the poet has contrived
that his numbers shall be harsh, in order to correspond to the ideas they
suggest, the common accentuation must be preserved.
"Mr. Sheridan, in his 'Art of Reading,' has insisted largely on the ne-
cessity of making a pause at the end of every line in poetry, whether the
sense requires it or not, which he says has hitherto escaped the observa-
tion of all writers on the subject; and this, he observes, is so necessary,
that without it we change the verse into prose. I asked Dr. Louth,
Mr. Garrick, and Dr. Johnson, about the propriety of this pause, and
they all agreed with Mr. Sheridan. Had I been less acquainted with
the subject, and seen less of the fallibility of great names upon it, I
should have yielded to this decision. In the first place, if the author
has so united the preceding and following lines in verse as to make them
real prose, why is a reader to do that which his author has neglected to
do; and indeed seems to have forbidden by the very nature of the com-
position. In the next place, this slight and almost insensible pause of
suspension does not seem to answer the end proposed by it; which is,
that of making the ear sensible of the versification, or of the number of
accentual impressions in every line. For this final pause is often so
small, when compared with that which precedes or follows it in the body
of the line, and this latter and larger pause is so often accompanied with
an inflection of voice which marks the formation of perfect sense, that
the boundaries of the verse become almost, if not utterly, imperceptible,
and the composition, for a few lines, falls into an harmonious kind of
prose. For it is evident, that it is not a small pause at the end of a line
in verse, which makes it appear poetry to the ear, so much as that adjust-
ment of the accented syllables which forms a regular return of stress,
whether the line be long or short. Accordingly, we find, that those lines
in blank verse, which have a long pause in the middle, from a conclusion
of the sense, and a very short one at the end, from the sense continuing,
are, in spite of all our address in reading, very prosaical. The best pro-
nouncers of tragedy have never observed this pause, and why it should
be introduced into other composition is not easily comprehended. The

11
numbers of the verse, the dignity of the language, an inversion of the
common order of the words, sufficiently preserve it from falling into
prose; and if the name of verse only be wanting, the loss is not very
considerable. When the line is terminated by a rhyme, the boundaries
of the verse are very discernible by the smallest pause; though the most
harmonious rhyming verse must be acknowledged to be that where the
rhyme is accompanied by a considerable pause in the sense; but as too
long a succession of these lines satiates the ear with too much equality,
we readily exchange sound for variety, or force of expression. Some-
times even the pauses before and after a rhyme are so considerable, and
that at the end of the rhyme so small, that the boundaries of the verse
are lost in the rapidity of the expression."-WALKER'S Elocution.
"Writers of blank verse affect to end the line without any pause, or with
as small a pause as possible; and readers are too apt, where they see no
pause at the end of the line, to run the lines together, without attending
to such pauses as they would make in prose, for fear we should suppose
they do not know how to read blank verse: this makes them frequently
pronounce the words at the end of one line and the beginning of the next
much more swiftly than any other part of the verse, to the utter ruin of
the harmony; for all verse requires a stated regular march of the sylla-
bles, and it is in this march the grandeur and beauty of the verse consists.
In reading blank verse, therefore, care must be taken to steer between
the one extreme of ending every line with a pause; and the other, of
running one line into another more rapidly than if they were prose."-
Ibid. Rhetorical Grammar.
A simile ought generally to be read in a lower pitch than the context.
In two similes in succession, the last simile must be in a lower pitch than
the former, and both nearly in a monotone.
Action is important to the orator, but it is a vulgar error to suppose
that the ancients considered it the most important requisite in speaking.
This mistake has probably arisen from a common mistranslation in the
anecdote related both by Cicero and Quintilian. "When Demosthenes
was asked what was the first point of eloquence, the second, and the
third, he answered, Action, action, action."-GUTHRIE'S Cicero. Actio
with the Romans comprised the general delivery, or what is now styled
elocution, and elocutio, the choice of words, or diction. Dr. Blair in
giving the anecdote translates actio, delivery. That this is the true
meaning is evident, for Cicero in a succeeding paragraph says, "But as
to the advantages and excellency of action, the chief and most desirable
lies in a good voice."
It has been said that action should not be studied before a mirror, but
that if the speaker be in earnest the action will follow. True, but it will
frequently be faulty. The action which we use in public, if we are in
earnest, will often be different to what we used when practising, but
that exercise will improve our involuntary gestures.
Support the body on one foot-generally the left-and so firmly, that
the other can relieve it promptly and easily. Let the right foot be a few
inches advanced, and the toes turned a little outwards. Always face your
audience, and brace the figure proportionately to the energy of the lan-
guage. The head should be held in an erect and natural posture, neither
drooping on one side, nor thrown back. Do not shake or nod the
head frequently, toss it violently, or agitate the hair by rolling it about.
The hair should not be allowed to cluster or hang over the forehead.

Shrugging of the shoulders, to express indifference or contempt, should
be sparingly used. Keep the elbow from inclining to the body. Avoid
swaying your body from side to side.
In all motions of the limbs, the movement ought generally to proceed
from the superior part; that is, from the shoulder, not the elbow; from
the thigh, not the knee; from the knuckle, not the finger joint; other-
wise the movements will be angular and ungraceful. Sometimes angular
actions are natural.
The hands are capable of great expression, and ought not to be co-
vered. The right hand should perform the principal and greater number
of gestures. Its action should be more forcible than that of the left.
Each arm may perform similar gestures when the body of the speaker is
presented towards the person addressed precisely in front, but not other-
wise; for one arm would conceal the other. Never mark a single idea or
word with more than one gesture.
6
"The principal gesture is performed by the advanced hand, and the
subordinate gesture by the retired hand. The best modern speakers use
either the right or the left hand indiscriminately, for the principal ges-
ture, as occasion may require. As this practice is altogether at variance
with the opinions and rules of the ancient critics and rhetoricians, it may
be proper to inquire how far we are justifiable in our departure from their
great authority. 'The left hand,' says Quintilian, can never, with
propriety, perform gesture alone; but it frequently acts in support of
the right hand.' The consideration of the dress of the ancients, which
differed so essentially from that of the moderns, may be sufficient to ac-
count for the difference between their customs and ours. The form of the
ancient dress obliged the speaker, if not totally to disuse his left hand,
at le to restrain its action very considerably. The oc sions on whi
the left hand may perform the principal gesture, are the following:-
1. When the persons addressed are on the left side, the left hand natu-
rally performs the principal gesture, in order to avoid the awkwardness of
gesticulating across the body. 2. The necessary discrimination of ob-
jects opposed to each other, requires the left hand alternately to perform
the principal gesture. 3. The advantage of variety. 4. The power of
giving, not only variety, but force, by occasionally elevating the retired
hand, and bestowing upon it all the spirit and authority of the gesture.
"But it is not only in the use of the left hand that modern speakers differ
from the ancients: they constantly violate another precept enjoined by
Quintilian and his followers-viz., that of speaking with the correspond-
ing hand and foot advanced; and yet, if the natural emotions afford any
just foundation for the manner of gesture, we shall be inclined to give the
preference to modern custom. Those passions which incline us to ad-
vance towards their object, as love, desire, anger, and revenge, naturally
cause the corresponding hand and foot to advance together with the head
and body; for in this way the nearest approach is made to the object.
And when passions of a contrary nature, as aversion and terror, affect us,
still the corresponding hand and foot are advanced; as if the better to
guard the body and head, which are thrown back. In such cases, it
would produce unnatural distortion to advance the contrary hand and
foot. Under tranquil circumstances, as when the speaker delivers narra-
tive, or reasons calmly, the contrary hand and foot may advance together
with grace and propriety. Indeed, perhaps such posture is preferable, as
it presents the body more exactly in front towards the persons addressed.


## p. 13 (#21) ##############################################

It was, probably, such circumstances alone which Quintilian had in view
when he pronounced his opinion, that it is unbecoming to stand with the
corresponding hand and foot advanced. This explanation will serve to
reconcile the apparent deviation of the moderns from the ancient prac-
tice."-COMSTOCK'S Elocution.
Changes of action must accord with the language. Sometimes the tran-
sition must be instantaneous; at others, modulating through other ges-
tures. The calmer the language, the slower should be the movements;
and vice versa.
Direct your eyes to those you address, unless the subject requires them
to be raised, &c. Never use any gestures merely for the display of the
person, or of some ornament. Never arrange your dress whilst speaking.
In painting descriptions by gestures, great judgment is necessary. In
some cases, a most powerful and natural effect may be produced; whilst
in others, descriptions realized would be most absurd.
Generally the voice, features, and limbs should simultaneously express
the same passion or thought. Sometimes the action should precede the
voice, as an ill-suppressed feeling.
Decision of action is more important than grace. The most ungrace-
ful action if decided, will be more effective than the most graceful with-
out decision. The two are seldom combined in their highest degrees. A
moderate amount of grace is very desirable.
Study repose; without it, both in action and speech, the eyes, ears, and
minds of the audience, and the powers of the speaker, are alike fatigued.
"I would exhort the comedian to study not only the effect of the
passions, but also their operations on his own face, that he may be able
to distinguish those which become, as well as those which disfigure it."
-ENGEL on Gesture, translated by H. Siddons. "We must, however,
take care to distinguish the difference betwixt an alteration of the fea-
tures, in order to express the sentiments of the soul, and the grimaces
that attend a play of the muscles; the first makes a speaker valuable, the
other makes a Scaramouch diverting."-RICCOBONI's Reflections upon
Declamation.
"A speaker ought to take care not to work himself up to tears; yet
if they shall naturally flow, he should not use the least effort to stop
them. The grimaces of a speaker, who forces himself to cry, are either
disgustful or ridiculous; but when his tears flow spontaneously, it rarely
happens that the emotions which attend them are disagreeable. The
speakers who endeavour to weep never can thoroughly feel what they
say; for when it is the soul that speaks, tears require no intermediate
assistance to make them flow. If they are affected, the cheat is easily
discovered, and the effect they have is either none at all, or very bad;
but if they are natural, they touch the heart, and steal the good wishes
of the spectators."-Ibid.
Above all, be in earnest. When the Bishop of London asked Betterton
"What could be the reason, that whole audiences should be moved to
tears, and have all sorts of passions excited, at the representation of some
story on the stage, which they knew to be feigned, and in the event of
which they were not at all concerned; yet that the same persons should
sit so utterly unmoved, at discourses from the pulpit, upon subjects of
the utmost importance to them, relative not only to their temporal, but
also their eternal interests ?" he received from the tragedian this memor-
able reply, "My Lord, it is because we are in earnest." But "before

the actor resigns himself to the government of his feelings, he ought to
be sure that he shall retain the power of guiding and correcting them
when they are growing too impetuous."-SIDDONS'S ENGEL on Gesture.
"The actor ought to seize all occasions of observing nature, even in
those effects which are unfrequent in their occurrence; and he should
never lose sight of the main end and grand design of his art, by shocking
the spectator with too coarse or too servile an imitation."-Ibid.
Do not substitute loudness for intensity. Intensity relates to passion
or feeling; loudness to strength of voice. The former should be pro-
portioned to the language; the latter to the size of the place. Their
difference is that of passion and rant, nature and extravagance.
Study to acquire variety in pitch, tone, rate and force of utterance,
action, expression, &c.; but use it with discretion, and never for the
sake of mere variety. It should always accord with the language.
Speaking in one manner, however good in its proper place, will fatigue
the speaker and weary the audience.
All public speaking, but especially acting and reciting, must be a little
heightened above ordinary nature, the pauses being longer and more
frequent, the words weightier, the action more forcible, and the expression
more highly coloured. The greater number of the auditors being at a
distance, it must have stronger touches and greater light and shade than
would be correct or necessary for a near view alone, but yet be so
moderated as not to disgust the nearest auditors by gross exaggeration.
As a statue or picture, placed at a distance, must be larger than life, but
yet a perfect resemblance. The features must be colossal, but not
different.
The Author of an Essay on the "ART OF DELIVERING WRITTEN
LANGUAGE," dedicated to Garrick, who "assured him that the doctrine
laid down in the Essay agreed exactly with his own sentiments,"
controverts the common direction, "Deliver yourselves in the same
manner you would do were the matter your own original sentiments
uttered directly from the heart," which precept, he observes, "has been
long reverberated from author to author as a perfect standard for pro-
priety in reading." After a very masterly analysis of the subject, he
concludes, "That the warmth and energy of our delivery in reading,
ought to be inferior to that used in speaking upon subjects in which we
are immediately interested," and gives the following definition:
"Reading is the art of delivering written language with propriety,
force, and elegance. Where (as in speaking) the pronunciation of the
words is copied after the polite and learned of our country, and the
emphasis of sense, the pauses, and significant cadences are determined
by the meaning of what is before us: where the modulation is borrowed
from fashionable speech, but a little improved and heightened in pro-
portion to the beauty and harmony of the composition: where all the
signs of the emotions are in quality the same as they would flow spon-
taneously from nature, but abated something in quantity, and those most,
which are in themselves of the disagreeable kind: where the emphasis
of force, ornamental cadences, the quantity of the above-named varia-
tions from natural speech, and some other less material particulars, are
directed by taste and custom; and (lastly) where affectation of every
sort is to be dreaded as the greatest blemish, and where ease, master-
liness, and genuine grace are considered as principal beauties, and the
proper substitutes for the inferior degree of warmth and energy, which

15
the delivery of written language ought always to discover, when com-
pared with the extemporary effusions of the heart."
Aetion is not necessary, except in impassioned reading, and when used
must be equally modified.
In reading, the book should be held in the left hand, a few inches
from the body, and as high as the centre of the breast, the face being
nearly perpendicular. It should not, however, be held so high as to
prevent the audience from seeing the reader's mouth, as the voice would
thereby be more or less obstructed, and the expression of the features
partly concealed. The fingers of the right hand may hold the margin
of the book lightly, so as to be ready to turn over the leaves, or they
may be placed just below the line the reader pronouncing, to aid him
in keeping his place. In reading an original or expressive composition,
the right hand may illustrate or enforce the sentiments by appropriate
action. The eyes should occasionally be directed from the words of the
discourse to the audience.
It is impossible for any one, however gifted, to become a finished
elocutionist without considerable study and practice. It, perhaps more
than any other art, depends on the latter, without which theory will be
unavailing.
In practice, do not pause to correct a fault, or a habit of hesitating
and correcting, frequently unnecessarily, will be formed. Finish the
sentence, and then speak it again. In public, correct a fault, if
palpable, but not otherwise.
Let the length of the passage you select for practice be proportioned
to the time you can devote, so that you can repeat it twice or thrice
during the time. At first, well study every sentence, speaking carefully;
afterwards, with more spirit. Before the passage becomes wearisome,
select another, and after a time recur to the former. If you have more
time than you can exercise without becoming fatigued, practice a portion
in a subdued manner, but with distinct articulation, expression, &c.
The ancients had a method of practising, styled, "the silent preparation
of the voice." Cresolinus illustrates it by a story from Plutarch.—“ A
barber at Rome had a magpie, possessing great imitative talents. The
funeral procession of a rich citizen stopped near the barber's shop, and a
solemn piece of music for trumpets was performed. For three days after-
wards the magpie kept such profound silence, that it was feared his ear
had been stunned by the trumpets, and that his talents and voice were
lost; but after this long silence, to the admiration and astonishment of
all, he began to imitate perfectly the whole music; so that his three days'
silence," Plutarch observes, arose from his mentally practising the
music." Mrs. Siddons, Garrick, and other eminent speakers, pursued the
same method.
66
In committing to memory, first read the whole passage; then learn
the first sentence, or paragraph; then the second; then join the latter to
the former, and so on to the end—always going back to the first line. If
very long, divide into sections, and learn one at a time in the above
manner. Learn aloud, but in a subdued voice. Night is the best time
for committing to memory. If you have been imperfect in the words of
a speech, &c., read them over two or three times the same day or night,
and they will be fixed in your memory the next morning.
Endeavour to learn something from every one, either by imitating, but
not servilely, what is good, or avoiding the bad. Remember that trifles
make perfection, and that perfection is no trifle.

Use notes to refer to, if you
"Action in expressing the various passions is to be suited to the age,
sex, condition, and circumstances of the character. A hero may show
fear, or sensibility of pain; but not in the same manner as a girl would
express those sensations. Grief may be expressed by a person reading a
melancholy story, or description, in a room. It may be acted upon the
stage; it may be dwelt upon by the pleader at the bar; or it may have
a place in a sermon. The passion is still grief, but the manner of ex-
pressing it will be different in each of the speakers, if they have judg-
ment."-BURGH.
Never read a speech if you can avoid it.
cannot dispense with all aid.
"In changing the position of the feet, the motions should be made
with the utmost simplicity, and free from the parade and sweep of danc-
ing. All changes, except where particular energy requires the speaker
to stamp, start back, or advance with marked decision, should be made
almost imperceptibly. The changes should not be too frequent : frequent
change gives the idea of anxiety and instability, which are unfavourable
to an orator. An orator should keep in his place.' He should perform
all the movements of his feet within the limits of thirty-six inches square,
and not be continually running about the room, as if labouring under the
effects of nitrous oxide."-COMSTOCK.

The correct "reading" of a passage frequently depends on a pause, as
in the first line of Gray's Elegy, usually printed,
"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,"
which was spoken by the celebrated Henderson, thus:—
"The curfew tolls;-the knell of parting day."
The following speech of Shylock, in the "Merchant of Venice,"
"Signor Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys, and my usances :"
was read by Henderson,
which agrees
"Signor Antonio, many a time-and oft
In the Rialto," &c.
with the previous passage,
"And he rails
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest!"
“A natural genius for delivery supposes an ear, though it does not al-
ways suppose a musical ear. I have never heard poetry, particularly that
of Milton, better spoken than by a gentleman, who yet had so little dis-
cernment in music, that he has often told me, the grinding of knives en-
tertained him as much as Handel's organ."-Burgh.
Coleridge, the author of "those exquisitely musical lines," as Moore
styles them,
"A damsel with a dulcimer," &c.,
says, "I have no ear whatever; I could not sing an air to save my life;
but I have the intensest delight in music, and can detect good from bad."
Pope, though so musical a poet, had no ear for music; the same is
reported of Swift; but the strongest instance is found in Garrick it is
an undoubted fact that he had no ear.
