OLIVET COLLEGE.
GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the Institution must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
They will be amenable to its regulations from the time of their arrival.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining full
membership. If, during this period, their scholarship, conduct, or character is
such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or unadvisable, they may be
so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without further action. Those
who remain through this period and are admitted to lull membership shall at the
required time sign the following pledge: I do hereby promise that I will observe
and obey all the laws made by the government of Olivet College for the students.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the record of the Faculty.
But when a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty, if they deem
it best, will separate him from the College without making formal charges.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty, select such particular
studies as they shall prefer.
Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of the first term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to the College classes, who are deficient in three
of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such condi-
tions are removed before the end of the year.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term.
At the close of the college year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees of gentlemen appointed annually by the Presbyterian Synod, the
Congregational Association, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for
the State. These examinations are always public

Scholarship.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a
lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.
Terms and Vacations.
The College Year is divided into three terms.
Commencement occurs on the fourth Thursday in June.
Vacation, twelve weeks.
The First Term begins Thursday, twelve weeks from Commencement, and
continues fourteen weeks.
Vacation for the Holidays.
The Second Term begins on the second Thursday of January, and continues
twelve weeks.
Vacation, one week.
The Third Term begins on the second Thursday of April, and continues till

No student is allowed to be absent without special leave, except in vacations.
Honors.
The honors of the Class of 18S4 were awarded as follows:

By the generous endowment of a Rhetorical Prize Fund, by Samuel F.
Drury, Esq., of Olivet, £50 is yearly distributed in prizes for excellence in
Composition and Oratory, as follows:

First Prize, for thought and style, to Fred Robert Bunker, Che-
boygan.
Twenty-five dollars at the Drury Prize Declamation of Students of the Pre-

For excellence in Declamation:
First Prize to John Benjamin Chaddock, Pewamo.
Second Prize to William Peter Rankin, Leslie.
For excellence in Composition:
First Prize to Ida Martha Ellis, Olivet.
Second Prize to Edith Laurette Bullis, Bay City.
Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from the
Classical Course, and that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from
the Scientific Course.
The degrees of Master of Arts and of Master of Science are conferred upon
Bachelors of three or more years' standing who have been engaged in literary or
scientific pursuits, and have sustained a good moral character.
Diplomas certifying the successful completion of the prescribed course of
study are given to the graduates from the Literary Course, and Certificates or
Diplomas to the graduates from the Normal Department.
The Palmer Museum.
The Palmer Museum of Paleontology, which is a gift of William B. Palmer,
of Olivet, contains the valuable collection known as the " Ward Series of Casts
of Fossils," which, for educational purposes, are equal in value to the originals.
These, together with the large collection of fossils, minerals, and typical rocks,
belonging to the Brown Cabinet, illustrate, in a very full and satisfactory man-
ner, the sciences of Geology, Paleontology, and Mineralogy.
The Brown Cabinet.
This collection has been appraised by experts at $18,000; and three fourths
of this sum is a gift from Rev. Dr. William B. Brown, of New York. The
Cabinet embraces more than 50,000 specimens; and they cast light upon three
departments in Natural Science.
The Fossils are numerous and valuable.
The collection of Minerals is rich and full, constituting Jhree fifths of all
found on Prof. Dana's list.
The Shells are most nearly complete scientifically. Prof. Martin, of the
University of New York, says of them that they illustrate the conchology of
the globe.

Mather Hall.
During the last year, a new Hall, two stories in height, has been erected, at
a cost of over £20,000, for the use of the various departments in Natural Science.
In the upper story of the main building is a room ninety feet by twenty-eight>
with a gallery around the central part, to be used for the Palmer Museum and
the Brown Cabinet. Adjoining the main building is an annex, two stories in
height, with a basement, forty feet by twenty-six. The upper story is devoted
to Botany, Zoology, and Mineralogy. This is immediately connected with the
Museum. In the second story is the Chemical Lecture Room, and in the base-
ment is the Laboratory, which is thoroughly equipped with all the modern appli-
ances for work in Analytical Chemistry.
In the lower story of the main building are two recitation rooms, an appa-
ratus room, and private laboratory. The Hall is heated by steam, and gas is
introduced to furnish heat for Chemical analysis.
In appreciation of the large donations made by Mr. Roland Mather, of
Hartford, Conn., to aid in the construction of this Hall, the Trustees have
named it "Mather Hall." It is beautiful in external appearance, and adds
greatly to the efficiency of the College.
Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies: the Soronian for
young ladies, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic for young gentlemen.
All have libraries and special assembly rooms.
These societies unite in inviting some gentleman from abroad to deliver an
annual address before them in connection with the College Commencement.
Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains about 12,000 well selected books and 14,000
unbound pamphlets. Large additions are regularly made to its numbers by
purchase and by gift. In addition to other sources of income, the interest of
the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually appropriated to the purchase of books.
This endowment, fifteen thousand dollars, is the gift of the late Mrs. Lucy E.
Tuttle, of Guilford, Conn., as a memorial of her gifted son, who died at the early
age of thirteen years.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Amherst system.
Each student is allowed to take two books and to retain them for two weeks.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, well supplied with the
leading journals of news, politics, religion, science, literature, and art. The fol-
lowing is a list of the periodicals to be found upon its tables.

Gifts of books, pamphlets, or periodicals, of any kind, are very acceptable;
odd volumes of books or periodicals may complete sets now in the Library, and
books or pamphlets deemed worthless by their owners have an enhanced value
when added to a comprehensive collection.
The Library and Reading-Room are open daily, except Sundays, to all
students. For the use of both no additional charge is made.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises generally accompany the Sunday-school at the College
Church.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request

is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students also sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association at
No. 6 Parsons Hall has been neatly fitted and furnished and affords an attract-
ive place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
A telephone office in Colonial Hall affords direct communication with all
the principal cities and villages of the State.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. The village is morally pure. There are no
saloons or gambling-places. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.

LADIES' DEPARTMENT.
Design.
The Course in this Department is intended to afford young ladies all the
facilities for a thorough education found in the best American seminaries for
women.
The course of study embraces branches found in both of the other courses.
Students of the two sexes recite together when their studies are the same. At
graduation, ladies are presented with diplomas. They are, however, encouraged
to pursue the full Classical Course, and obtain the usual degree in the Arts.
Government.
This Department is subject to the same general management as the Depart-
ment for young men; but it is under the supervision of the Principal.
The students reside with the Principal and the Matron in Shipherd Hall.
The Principal is chiefly responsible for the government of the students.
She will receive them on their first arrival at the College; assign them their
rooms and room-mates; change the same whenever circumstances require; and
exercise a general maternal supervision over their personal habits and moral
interests. Parents are invited to make to her, freely, such confidential communi-
cations as may aid her in understanding the characters of their daughters, that
she may the better promote their welfare.
Admission.
Any young lady wishing to enter the Institution should make previous
application by letter to the Principal of the Ladies' Department, stating her age,
acquirements, and wishes as regards studies and room.
Girls under fifteen years of age will not be received unless by special
arrangement with the Principal.
Expenses.
Tuition in College classes is $7.00 a term; in Preparatory classes, $5.00 to
$7.00 a term.

fitted in every way as a convenient and pleasant home for young ladies. The
new building contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teacher, and Matron,
together with accommodations for seventy-five students. It is heated by fur-
naces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished. It has been
enlarged by the addition of a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet,

ART DEPARTMENT.
The aim here is, first, to develop and cultivate a taste for the beautiful, not
only by personal acquaintance with fine art, but also by means of lectures upon
its theories and principles; secondly, to add that discipline of the mind which
is the result of a direct and thorough study of form and color in nature; thirdly,
to give art that place in the symmetrical development of the student's mind
which it now occupies in the cultured world.
For practical work an Art Room has been furnished with easels, casts,
patterns, and all necessary materials.
A Course of Art has been arranged, and may be had upon application.
This course can be completed in connection with a four-years' course of College
study; if pupils make art a specialty, it will require but two years. The
latest and best methods of instruction will be followed, and the drill in Model
and Object Drawing and Perspective will be thorough.
One term of Free-Hand and of Perspective Drawing will be given to every
student without extra charge. The prices for a term of twenty-four lessons will
be as follows:
Pencil Drawing $4.00
Perspective 4.00
Charcoal Drawing with use of Casts 6.00
Crayon Drawing 12.00
China Painting . 12.00
Water Colors and Sepia 12.00
Oil Painting 12.00

52 OLIVET COLLEGE
MICHIGAN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
This Conservatory offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical — either exclusively or with other studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The course of study is comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
The Piano-Forte.
In the study of this instrument, great attention is given to every detail of
Technique. Especial care is taken to develop a truly musical touch, and an
expressive style of playing.
The following is an outline of the studies pursued, the teacher selecting
those which may be most profitably used by the pupil. Four years is the time
usually needed for its completion, but this will depend wholly upon the capacity
and progress of the individual.

lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church

• Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken by beginners, as by a knowledge of it
much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music A
practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight . The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's "Instrumentation."
Cultivation of the Voice.
The instruction in Voice Culture embraces careful training in the control of
the breath, and the use of the vocal organs for the production of a pure tone and
distinct enunciation.
Voices are not strained or abnormally developed, but cultivated and ex-
panded in accordance with their natural capacities. Hence the progress is
rapid and thorough. Great attention is paid to singing at sight.
Vocalises by Panofka, Concone, and others, together with songs, ballads,
opera, and oratorio selections are used for the formation of method and cultiva-
tion of style.
Cabinet Organ.
In the study of this instrument, pupils are instructed in playing Church
Music, Voluntaries, etc., great care being taken not only that the pupil shall be
familiar with all the resources of the instrument, but also, having completed the
course of study, shall be fully prepared to undertake the study of the Pipe Organ.
Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been instituted:
Organ Recitals, Piano Recitals, Popular Concerts, and Exhibition Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of musical art. The Popular Concerts offer music
of a pleasing character, intended to entertain the general public. The Exhibi-
tion Concerts occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the
progress and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a very high order, and have
received great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals
take place every Friday afternoon, at which time pupils perform vocal and
instrumental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, at their annual session in
June, 1870, the treasurer is directed to publish annually in the Catalogue a full
statement of all contributions to the College, and the names and residences of
the contributors. But donations to the College in the form of real estate or
personal notes are not included in this list, until they are converted into cash. ■
The subjoined is such a statement, covering the period extending from
November 6, 18S3, to November 5, iS#4, but does not include payments of
interest. This statement is designed to be fully correct and particular. Should,
however, any person discover any omission or error in this record of benevolence
to the College, he will confer a great favor by promptly pointing out the same to
the Treasurer or President of the College.

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for any
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, and Greek Grammar and Composition; past
experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his attainments
in these subjects. General information must not be regarded as an equivalent
for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms
and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" below. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
They will be amenable to its regulations from the time of their arrival.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining full
membership. If, during this period, their scholarship, conduct, or character is
such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or unadvisable, they may be
so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without further action. Those
who remain through this period and are admitted to full membership shall at the
required time sign the following pledge: I do hereby promise that I will observe
and obey all the laws made by the government of Olivet College for the students.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the record of the Faculty.
But when a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty, if they deem
it best, will separate him from the College without making formal charges.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty, select such particular
studies as they shall prefer.
Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of the first term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to the College classes, who are deficient in three
of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such condi-
tions are removed before the end of the year.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term.
At the close of the college year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees of gentlemen appointed annually by the Presbyterian Synod, the
Congregational Association, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for
the State. These examinations are always public.

Scholarship.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded
to a lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.
Terms and Vacations.
The College Year is divided into three terms.
Commencement occurs on the fourth Thursday in June.
Vacation, twelve weeks.
The First Term begins Thursday, twelve weeks from Commencement, and
continues fourteen weeks.
Vacation for the Holidays.
The Second Term begins on the first Thursday of January, and continues
twelve weeks.
Vacation, one week.
The Third Term begins on the second Thursday of April, and continues till

Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from the
Classical Course, that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from the
Scientific Course, and that of Bachelor of Letters upon the graduates from
the Literary Course.
The Masters' Degrees are conferred upon Bachelors of three or more
years' standing who have been engaged in literary or scientific pursuits, and
have sustained a good moral character.
Certificates or Diplomas are given to the graduates from the Normal
Department.
The Palmer Museum.
The Palmer Museum of Paleontology, which is a gift of William B. Palmer,
of Olivet, contains the valuable collection known as the " Ward Series of Casts
of Fossils," which, for educational purposes, are equal in value to the originals.
These, together with the large collection of fossils, minerals, and typical rocks,
belonging to the Brown Cabinet, illustrate, in a very full and satisfactory
manner, the sciences of Geology, Paleontology, and Mineralogy.
The Brown Cabinet.
This collection has been appraised by experts at $18,ooo; and three fourths
of this sum is a gift from Rev. Dr. William B. Brown, of New York. The
Cabinet embraces more than 50,000 specimens; and they cast light upon three
departments in Natural Science.
The Fossils are numerous and valuable.
The collection of Minerals is rich and full, constituting three fifths of all
found on Prof. Dana's list.
The Shells are most nearly complete scientifically. Prof. Martin, of the
University of New York, says of them that they illustrate the conchology
of the globe.
Library and Reading Room.
The College Library contains about 13,000 well selected books and 14,000
unbound pamphlets. Large additions are regularly made to its numbers by
purchase and by gift. In addition to other sources of income, the interest of
the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually appropriated to the purchase of books.
This endowment, fifteen thousand dollars, is the gift of the late Mrs. Lucy E.
Tuttle, of Guilford, Conn., as a memorial of her gifted son, who died at the
early age of thirteen years.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Amherst system.
Each student is allowed to take two books and to retain them for two weeks.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, well supplied with the

Mather Hall.
During the last year a new Hall, two stories in height, has been erected at
a cost of over $25,000 for the use of the various departments in Natural Science.
In the upper story of the main building is a room ninety feet by twenty-eight,
with a gallery around the central part, to be used for the Palmer Museum and
the Brown Cabinet. Adjoining the main building is an annex, two stories in
height, with a basement, forty feet by twenty-six. The upper story is devoted
to Botany, Zoology, and Mineralogy. This is immediately connected with the
Museum. In the second story is the Chemical Lecture Room, and in the base-
ment is the Laboratory, which is thoroughly equipped with all the modern
appliances for work in Analytical Chemistry.
In the lower story of the main building are two recitation rooms, an
apparatus room, and private laboratory. The Hall is heated by steam, and gas
is introduced to furnish heat for Chemical analysis.
In appreciation of the large donations made by Mr. Roland Mather, of
Hartford, Conn., to aid in the construction of this Hall, the Trustees have
named it "Mather Hall." It is beautiful in external appearance, and adds
greatly to the efficiency of the College.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises generally accompany the Sunday-school at the College
Church.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students also sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association at No.
6 Parsons Hall has been neatly fitted and furnished, and affords an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.

Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. The village is morally pure. There are no
saloons or gambling-places. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.

MICHIGAN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
This Conservatory offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical — either exclusively or with other studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The course of study is comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which arc to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
The Piano-Forte.
In the study of this instrument, great attention is given to every detail of
Technique. Especial care is taken to develop a truly musical touch, and an
expressive style of playing.
The following is an outline of the studies pursued, the teacher selecting
those which may be most profitably used by the pupil. Four years is the time
usually needed for its completion, but this will depend wholly upon the capacity
and progress of the individual.

The Organ.
A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter octaves
of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to be obtained
at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ Playing, particu-
lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church
Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Concert Music, with special
attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn. Pupils, when advanced, are
afforded practical experience in accompanying the Choir in Chorus and Quartette.
Text-books and other works which are used in this Course are as follows:
Ritter's and Rink's Organ Schools; Thayer's Pedal Technics; Studies in
Pedal Phrasing by Dudley Buck; Bach's Preludes, Fugues and Toccatas;
Bach's, Mendelssohn's and Merkel's Sonatas; Handel's Concertos, and, for
practice in free-style playing, selections from works by Guilmant, Batiste, Letn-
mens, etc.
A series of Organ Recitals is given every year by the Director. The selec-
tions embrace a wide range of the finest compositions for the Organ.


## p. 68 (#142) #############################################

68 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken by beginners, as by a knowledge of it
much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music. A
practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's "Instrumentation."
Cultivation of the Voice.
The instruction in Voice Culture embraces careful training in the control of
the breath, and the use of the vocal organs for the production of a pure tone and
distinct enunciation.
Voices are not strained or abnormally developed, but cultivated and ex-
panded in accordance with their natural capacities. Hence the progress is
rapid and thorough. Great attention is given to singing at sight.
Vocalises by Panofka, Concone, and others, together with songs, ballads,
opera, and oratorio selections are used for the formation of method and cultiva-
tion of style.
Cabinet Organ.
In the study of this instrument, pupils are instructed in playing Church
Music, Voluntaries, etc., great care being taken not only that the pupil shall be
familiar with all the resources of the instrument, but also, having completed the
course of study, shall be fully prepared to undertake the study of the Pipe Organ.
Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been instituted:
Organ Recitals, Piano Recitals, Popular Concerts, and Exhibition Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of musical art. The Popular Concerts offer music
of a pleasing character, intended to entertain the general public. The Exhibi-
tion Concerts occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the
progress and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a very high order, and have
received great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals
take place every Friday afternoon, at which time pupils perform vocal and
instrumental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as

OLIVET COLLEGE. 69
they afford an opportunity of playing before others. All the friends and pupils
of the Conservatory are invited to attend.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.
The Normal and College singing classes meet twice a week, and are free to all
students.
Examinations.
Upon entering the Conservatory, students will be examined in the various
branches to be studied. To facilitate examination, each pupil should be pre-
pared to give a full statement of previous courses of study which may have been
pursued, and to play or sing two or more well-practiced pieces as examples of
attainment, besides scales and exercises.

Miscellaneous Items.
Names must be registered and tuition paid before lessons are assigned.
Pupils are not received for a shorter period than one term.
Pupils must furnish or hire suitable instruments for practice. Instruments
can be hired at Shipherd Hall and in the village.
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of protracted
sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the pupil.
Those who substitute Music for any study in the Literary Course are required
to devote at least two hours a day to the study of the Piano, Organ, or Vocal
Music, and to pursue the study of Theory for three terms.
Terms in the Conservatory correspond with those in the College.
Pupils in the Conservatory are subject to the regulations of the College.
Diplomas are awarded to those who complete the course and attain the
standard for graduation on recommendation of the College Faculty. At least
three years' study of Theory will be required for graduation. Those making
Theory a specialty will be required to pursue the study four years.
In some cases members of the Conservatory have been able to pay a part
of their expenses by suitable employment. Such aid will be furnished as far as
possible to any who may need and require it. All persons desiring musical
instruction are encouraged and assisted in every possible way.
In every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be cheerfully
recommended for positions as Teachers and Organists.

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, at their annual session in
June, 1870, the Treasurer is directed to publish annually in the Catalogue a full

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year, students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for any
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, and Greek Grammar and Composition; past
experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his attainments
in these subjects. General information must not be regarded as an equivalent
for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms
and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH COURSE.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" below. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
They will be amenable to its regulations from the time of their arrival.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining full
membership. If, during this period, their scholarship, conduct, or character is
such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or unadvisable, they may be
so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without further action. Those
who remain through this period and are admitted to full membership shall at the
required time sign the following pledge: I do hereby promise that I will observe
and obey all the laws made by the government of Olivet College for the students.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the record of the Faculty.
But when a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty, if they deem
it best, will separate him from the College without making formal charges.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty, select such particular
studies as they shall prefer.
Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of the first term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present-
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to the College classes, who are deficient in three
of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such condi-
tions are removed before the end of the year.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term-
At the close of the college year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees of gentlemen appointed annually by the Presbyterian Synod, the
Congregational Association, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for
the State. These examinations are always public.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 43
Scholarship.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a
lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.

Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from the
Classical Course, that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from
the Scientific Course, and that of Bachelor of Letters upon the graduates
from the Literary Course.
The Masters' Degrees are conferred upon Bachelors of three or more
years' standing who have been engaged in literary or scientific pursuits, and
have sustained a good moral character.
Certificates or Diplomas are given to the graduates from the Normal
Department.
The Museum of Natural History.
The collections of the College have lately been given new and spacious
apartments in Mather Hall. Besides a more general zoological collection,
there is on display, due chiefly to the generosity of Rev. Dr. Wm. B. Brown,
a collection of 30,000 minerals, 10,000 shells, and several hundred paleonto-
logical specimens. The department of Geology is further supplied with a very
complete series of " Ward's Reproductions," the gift of Wm. B. Palmer.
All museum material is for the immediate use of the students, and is for
worh rather than for mere exhibition.
The Biological Laboratory is in direct communication with the
Museum, and is supplied with all the necessary apparatus for the demonstra-
tion of the more important phenomena of life. As an introduction, there is
prosecuted a thorough course in the general structure and morphology of the
flowering plants, the students being supplied with material and with dissecting
microscopes (Zentmayer). Instruction is given in the methods of Herbarium
work, and each student is obliged to collect, properly identify, and finally
mount, at least fifty specimens of the more common flowering plants. With
this work is coupled instruction in Physiological Botany, and finally, in the
junior year, the Cryptogams are studied from a purely physiological standpoint.
Histological work being made possible by means of microtomes and ten com-
pound microscopes (Zeiss).


## p. 45 (#193) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 45
For Zoology the Museum is being supplied with the necessary types, and
students are furnished with material, for their own use, illustrating the several
branches of the animal kingdom. These specimens are carefully dissected in
the laboratory, which is supplied with all important appliances and reagents
for pursuing the more modern methods of work.
Chemistry.
The department of Chemistry occupies commodious rooms for lecture
and laboratory purposes. The laboratory is fitted up according to modern
methods; and is supplied with every convenience for experimentation, and for
chemical analysis.
The' course, at present, covers one year.
There is also a course in Determinative Mineralogy and Blow-pipe Analysis.
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene.
Human anatomy, physiology, and hygiene have a prominent place in the
curriculum, and are studied by aid of text-book, lectures, charts, and models.
Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains about 13,500 well selected books and 14,000
unbound pamphlets. Large additions are regularly made to its numbers by
purchase and by gift. In addition to other sources of income, the interest of
the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually appropriated to the purchase of books.
This endowment, fifteen thousand dollars, is the gift of the late Mrs. Lucy E.
Tuttle, of Guilford, Conn., as a memorial of her gifted son, who died at the
early age of thirteen years.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Amherst system.
Each student is allowed to take two books and to retain them for two weeks.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, well supplied with the
leading journals of news, politics, religion, science, literature, and art. The
following is a list of the periodicals to be found upon its tables:
Atlantic Monthly. Nineteenth Century. Cheboygan Tribune.
Century Magazine. Athenaeum. Jackson Citizen.
Harper's Magazine. Punch. Olivet News.
Lippincott's Magazine. Scandinavia. Kalamazoo Telegraph.

Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies; the Soronian for
young ladies, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic for young gentlemen.

Bible. These exercises are held every Monday 6.30-7.30 p.m., and the course
of study is as follows:

The analysis of books this year is confined to the Old Testament.
Second Year. The same general and special work in the New Testa-
ment; together with the historical and logical connection between the Old and
New Testament.
Thied Year. The study of the principal characters of the Old Testament
in the light of the Old Dispensation; and the study of the characters of the
New Testament, except Christ.
Fourth Year. The study of Christ as set forth in the Gospels.
Fifth Year. The planting and developing of the Jewish and Christian
church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Sixth Year. Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Seventh Year. Doctrines and duties as set forth in the Old Testament
and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students also sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain week'y religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association at No.
6 Parsons Hall has been neatly fitted and furnished, and affords an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and

the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. The village is morally pure. There are no
saloons or gambling-places. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.

MICHIGAN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
This Conservatory offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical — either exclusively or with other studies
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The course of study is comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.

Technique. Especial care is taken to develop a truly musical touch, and an
expressive style of playing.

lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church

tions embrace a wide range of the finest compositions for the Organ.

60 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken by beginners, as by a knowledge of it
much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and instrumental Music. A
practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's " Instrumentation."
Cultivation of the Voice.
The instruction in Voice Culture embraces careful training in the control of
the breath, and the use of the vocal organs for the production of a pure tone
and distinct enunciation.
Voices are not strained or abnormally developed, but cultivated and ex-
panded in accordance with their natural capacities. Hence the progress is
rapid and thorough. Great attention is given to singing at sight.
Vocalises by Panofka, Concone, and others, together with songs, ballads,
opera, and oratorio selections are used for the formation of method and cultiva-
tion of style.
Cabinet Organ.
In the study of this instrument, pupils are instructed in playing Church
Music, Voluntaries, etc., great care being taken not only that the pupil shall be
familiar with all the resources of the instrument, but also, having completed the
course of study, shall be fully prepared to undertake the study of the Pipe Organ.
Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been insti-
tuted: Organ Recitals, Piano Recitals, Popular Concerts, and Exhibition
Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of musical art. The Popular Concerts offer
music of a pleasing character, intended to entertain the general public. The
Exhibition Concerts occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to
show the progress and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a very high order»
and have received great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students'
Rehearsals take place every Friday afternoon, at which time pupils perform
vocal and instrumental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year, students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for any
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, and Greek Grammar and Composition; past
experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his attainments
in these subjects. General information must not be regarded as an equivalent
for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms
and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH COURSE.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" following. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 89
GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
They will be amenable to its regulations from the time of their arrival.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the Treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the record of the Faculty.
When a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty, if they deem it
best, will separate him from the College without making formal charges.
Preliminary Arrangements.
On reaching town for the first time young men entering the Classical, Liter-
ary, or Scientific Department may obtain any needed information from President
Butterfield; young men in the Preparatory Department, Normal, or Elective
work, from Principal King; and young ladies in any department, from the
Principal of the Ladies' Department. Correspondence may be addressed to the
Secretary of the College, G. W. Keyes, Olivet, Mich.
Entrance Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of the first term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to the College classes, who are deficient in three
of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such condi-
tions are removed before the end of the year.
Certificates from Other Schools.
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies are
accepted from several high schools of the State of whose thoroughness the
Faculty have assured themselves.


## p. 40 (#270) #############################################

40 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Satisfactory certificates from any schools of good standing are accepted for
the following studies:
Arithmetic, Geography, Civil Government, United States History, Gram
mar, and Elementary Philosophy, Physiology, and Physical Geography.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a
lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term-
At the close of the College year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees of gentlemen appointed annually by the Congregational Associa-
tion, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State. These exam-
inations are always public.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty, select such particular
studies as they shall prefer.

## p. 41 (#271) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 41
By the generous endowment of a Rhetorical Prize Fund by the late Samuel
F. Drury, Esq., of Olivet, $50 is yearly distributed in prizes for excellence in
Composition and Oratory, as follows:
Twenty-five dollars at the Prize Exhibition of Students of the Classical,
Scientific, and Literary Courses, to be awarded in two equal prizes.
These prizes for 1887 were awarded as follows:
First Prize for thought and style, to Elwell Owen Mead, Olivet.
First Prize for delivery, to Henry Gaston Bissell, Ahmednagar,
India.
Twenty-five dollars at the Prize Exhibition of Students of the Preparatory
Course. These prizes for 1887 were awarded —
For excellence in Declamation:
First Prize to Abram Adelbert Kester, Olivet.
Second Prize to Rollin De Witte Bailey, Constantine.
For excellence in Composition:
First Prize to Nettie Clare Hinman, Portland.
Second Prize to Minnie Adella Cummings, Brainard, Dak.
Scholarship Prize.
Rev. John H. Hewitt, a professor in Williams College, and formerly a
professor in this College, has given $1,000 to establish a prize in memory of
his son, John Downing Hewitt. It is awarded, at the close of the second year in
College, to that student in the Classical Course who has ranked highest in the
regular studies of the Freshman and Sophomore years.
Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from the
Classical Course, that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from
the Scientific Course, and that of Bachelor of Letters upon the graduates
from the Literary Course.
The Masters' Degrees are conferred upon Bachelors of three or more
years' standing who have been engaged in literary or scientific pursuits, and
have sustained a good moral character.
Certificates or Diplomas are given to the graduates from the Normal
Department.
The Museum of Natural History.
The collections of the College have lately been given new and spacious
apartments in Mather Hall. Besides a more general zoological collection,
there is on display, due chiefly to the generosity of Rev. Dr. Wm. B. Brown,
a collection of 30,000 minerals, 10,000 shells, and several hundred paleonto-
logical specimens. The department of Geology is further supplied with a very
complete series of " Ward's Reproductions" the gift of Wm. B. Palmer.


## p. 42 (#272) #############################################

42 OLIVET COLLEGE.
The Museum has been greatly enlarged during the past year, and now con-
tains one of the most complete synoptic collections that is to be found in the
West. All museum material is for the use of the students, and is for worh
rather than for mere exhibition.
Biology and Geology.
Special attention has recently been given to the department of Biology. The
Laboratory is in direct communication with the Museum, and is supplied
with all the necessary apparatus for the demonstration of the more important
phenomena of life. As an introduction, there is prosecuted a thorough
course in the general structure and morphology of the flowering plants, the
students being supplied with material and with dissecting microscopes-
Practical work is done in the line of preparing and classifying the more
common plants, and students are required to do not a little Physiological
Work.
The first term in Zoology is spent in a general survey and in the careful
study of types. This method is rendered practical by supplying each student
with abundant live and prepared material for individual dissection, and by
using the more modern methods of investigation and demonstration.
The advanced course in Zoology is intended for those who wish to become
proficient in this branch. Each student is supplied with simple and compound
microscopes, and is taught the methods of microscopical research. Sections of
the more important tissues are prepared and permanently mounted, and atten-
tion is given to the preparation of skeletons of the type Vertebrates.
The advanced class in Botany considers the lower forms of plant life, per-
forming physiological experiments and preparing the more typical forms for
subsequent illustration. Microtomes and compound microscopes are made
use of in histological work.
For the teaching of Geology the Museum presents a very complete series
of fossils and reproductions. The collection of minerals is rich. Fhotographs,
Models, and Field-work make the course practical.
Meteorology.
The College has within the past year been incorporated as the seat of a
Signal Service Station. Regular observations are taken, and such students as
are interested have ample opportunity to do special work in this more immedi"
ately practical science.
The Department of Chemistry.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.


## p. 43 (#273) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 43
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-four students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances, and
other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
The course begins with the Fall term of the Sophomore year, and continues
one year. General Chemistry is first considered, and studied by aid of text-
book, lectures, and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed to
aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science. The
students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and learn, and
report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues through
the remainder of the year.'
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and laboratory
work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative or organic, may make special
arrangements with the professor for this purpose.
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene.
Human anatomy, physiology, and hygiene have a prominent place in the
curriculum, and are studied by aid of textbooks, lectures, charts, and models.
Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains 15,000 volumes and 14.500 pamphlets.
Its books have been selected with care and with reference to the work of
both professors and students. Hence its growth has been healthful and adapted
to the wants of the College. In addition to other sources of income, the interest
of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually appropriated to the purchase of
books. This endowment, fifteen thousand dollars, is the gift of the late Mrs.
Lucy E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Conn., as a memorial of her gifted son, who died
at the early age of thirteen years.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Dewey system.
Each student is allowed to take two books and to retain them for two weeks.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, well supplied with the
leading journals of news, politics, religion, science, literature, and art. The
following is a list of the periodicals to be found upon its tables:

Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association,
at No. 6 Parsons Hall, has been neatly fitted up, and affords an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Bible Study.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises are held every Monday, 6.30-7.30 p.m., and the course
of study is as follows:
Fiest Year: The study of the Bible in its more material form, as a part
of every scholar's education. Origin, preservation, grand divisions, and sub-
divisions, with relations of each to the other; authors, books, and .elative
position, with name and brief analysis of each; also a simple presentation of
such questions as the term day, length of life, unity of the race, deluge, miracles,
plagues, etc., to the end of founding the student in the Christian faith, rather
than for the simple historical study.
The analysis of books this year is confined to the Old Testament.
Second Year: The same general and special work in the New Testa-
ment; together with the historical and logical connection between the Old and
New Testaments.
Thied Year: The study of the principal characters of the Old Testament
in the light of the Old Dispensation; and the study of the characters of the
New Testament, except Christ.
Fourth Year: The study of Christ as set forth in the Gospels.
Fifth Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and Christian
church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Sixth Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Seventh Year: Doctrines and duties as set forth in the Old Testament
and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.

46 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Ladies' Department.
Young women in all departments of study are under the supervision of the
Principal of the Ladies' Department, and the care of the Ladies' Board. They
are required to be in their rooms during study hours unless engaged in some
class exercise.
Every young woman is required to present, once a week, a written report
of her observance of the regulations of the Department.
Shipherd Hall.
Thi3 building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder of
the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teacher, and Matron,
together with accommodations for seventy-five young ladies. It is heated
by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished. It has been
enlarged by the addition of a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet,
containing a spacious dining-hall, also kitchen and laundry, besides commodious
rooms in the second story for students.
It is desirable that all young ladies from abroad should be members of the
family with the Principal and Matron in this Hall. They are allowed, however,
to secure rooms and board in approved families of the place.
Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who gave
liberally for its erection in 1866. It contains the College Office, Library, five
Recitation Rooms, and Dormitories for young men; also the rooms of the Phi
Alpha Pi and Adelphic Literary Societies, and of the Young Men's Christian
Association.
Mather Hall.
This new and commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000,
bears the name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Conn., who was its chief donor.
It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides two large Recitation Rooms, it
contains the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for Chemistry, Botany, Geology,
Biology, and Zoology. It contains also the College Museum and the Signal
Service Station.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and table board for young men or women can be had at the College
halls or in private families, as preferred. Young women proposing to live in
private families are expected to consult with the Principal before engaging their
boarding-places.
In private families, table board and furnished rooms range in price from


## p. 47 (#277) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 47
$2.50 to $4-50 a week, fuel and lights included. Table board in Shipherd Hall
may be had at present for 52-25 a week. Room rent for unfurnished rooms in
Parsons Hall is from $2.50 to $3.75 a term. Students who are willing to live
plainly reduce their expenses by boarding in clubs; the price of club board has
for the past three years ranged from $1.50 to $1.90 a week. With the practice
of economy in all expenditures, one hundred dollars, added to the earnings of one
or two hours' work a day, can be made to meet all necessary expenses for a
College year.

Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to remit
the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing for the
ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship and character
proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not extend to the incidental
charge, to room rent, or to the tuition in any study outside of the regular
course.
Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of Presbytery to the amount of $100 to $132 a year.
Members of the College classes whose necessities require it may be absent
two terms of their course for the purpose of teaching. They will be required
to pass examination in the studies pursued by their classes during their absence.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily need to leave College for lach of means.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find
employment about the College or in the village for themselves with satisfactory
compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies. A limited
number of the young ladies at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of their board by
assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the homes of the village.
A few students, by rigid economy and hard work, meet all their expenses from
their earnings while studying, but in such cases health and studies are likely to
suffer. No one should come, even for one term, without at least thirty or forty
dollars at his command for use if needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few
students, as provided for elsewhere, and the College has funds for otherwise
aiding to some extent certain classes of needy students. The great advantage
Olivet College offers students of this class, however, is the very low rate at
which all its facilities are offered. The traditions of the College, and the public
sentiment of the students, favor economy in all living expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
When a student occupying a room in College is to be absent from town
more than two weeks, he shall leave his key, with label attached, at the Treas-
urer's office, under penalty of forfeiting his room.


## p. 50 (#280) #############################################

50 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be retained unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required exercise.
Ladies and gentlemen are never allowed to call at each other's rooms
except in cases of severe illness, and then only by special permission.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution, by-laws, and usages of all societies of undergraduates shall
be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Girls and boys under fifteen years of age will not be received unless by
special arrangement.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. The village is morally pure. There are no
saloons or gambling-places. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.

Secretary of Olivet College,

ART DEPARTMENT.
It is the object of this department to develop in the student's mind an
exact and correct idea of form, as well as an appreciation of the beautiful; also
to train the powers of observation until the students are capable of working
independently from life and sketching from nature.
A thorough understanding of the principles of drawing is followed by the
study of form from simple models and casts, afterwards studies in still life,
sketching from nature, and the study of the human form.
Pencil Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four lessons.
This comprises the fundamental principles of drawing, working from the flat,
followed by the study of form or extension, from simple objects, models, and
casts.
Perspective Drawing.
Charcoal Drawing comprises drawing from the cast and still life studies.
A good assortment of casts of leaves, fruit, fragments of the human form, etc.,
has been provided for this work.
Crayon Drawing — Finished pictures and crayon portraits.
Oil and Water Colors — Studies in still life, landscapes, flowers, figures,
etc.
Students wishing to make Art a specialty can have instruction and the use
of the Art Room and models, daily.
v China Colors embrace the decorating of china, vases, tiles, etc., in
mineral colors. Gilding is also done. A portable kiln has been provided for
the firing of porcelain.
A term's work comprises twenty-four lessons, each two hours long.
Tuition to be paid in advance, and no deduction made for absence from
lessons only in cases of sickness.
During Commencement week there is an exhibition of work done daring
the year, and it is necessary that the work be either left in the studio or sent
back at that time.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 57
MICHIGAN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
This Conservatory offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical — either exclusively or with other .studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The course of study is comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
The Piano-Forte.
In the study of this instrument, great attention is given to every detail of
Technique. Especial care is taken to develop a truly musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.
The following is an outline of the studies pursued, the teacher selecting
those which may be most profitably used by the pupil. Four years is the time
usually needed for its completion, but this will depend wholly upon the capacity
and progress of the individual.

A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter octaves
of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to be obtained
at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ Playing, particu-
lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church
Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Concert Music, with special
attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn. Pupils, when advanced, are
afforded practical experience in accompanying the Choir in Chorus and Quartette.

tions embrace a wide range of the finest compositions for the Organ.

60 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music.
A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's " Instrumentation."
History of Music.
A series of lectures on this subject will be given every year by the Director.
Cultivation of the Voice.
The instruction in Voice Culture embraces careful training in the control of
the breath, and the use of the vocal organs for the production of a pure tone
and distinct enunciation.
Voices are not strained or abnormally developed, but cultivated and ex-
panded in accordance with their natural capacities. Hence the progress is
rapid and thorough. Great attention is given to singing at sight.
Vocalises by Panofka, Concone, and others, together with songs, ballads,
opera, and oratorio selections, are used for the formation of method and cultiva-
tion of style.
Cabinet Organ.
In the study of this instrument, pupils are instructed in playing Church
Music, Voluntaries, etc., great care being taken not only that the pupil shall be
familiar with all the resources of the instrument, but also, having completed the
course of study, shall be fully prepared to undertake the study of the Pipe Organ.
Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been insti-
tuted: Organ Recitals, Piano Recitals, Popular Concerts, and Exhibition
Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of mmical art. The Popular Concerts offer

vocal and instrumental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, at their annual session in
June, 1870, the Treasurer is directed to publish annually in the catalogue a full
statement of all contributions to the College, and the names and residences of
the contributors. But donations to the College in the form of real estate or
personal notes are not included in this list until they are converted into cash.
The subjoined is such a statement, covering the period extending from
November 6, 1886, to November 5, 1887, but does not include payments of
interest. This statement is designed to be fully correct and particular. Should,
however, any person discover any omission or error in this record of benevolence
to the College, he will confer a great favor by promptly pointing out the same to
the Treasurer or President of the College.

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year, students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for any
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, and Greek Grammar and Composition; past
experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his attainments
in these subjects. General information must not be regarded as an equivalent
for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms
and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH COURSE.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" following. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 41
GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
Students will be amenable to the regulations of the College from the time
of their arrival.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the Treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the records of the Faculty.
When a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty may separate
him from the College without making formal charges.
Preliminary Arrangements.
On reaching town for the first time young men entering the Classical, Liter-
ary, or Scientific Department may obtain any needed information from President
H. Q. Butterfield; young men in the Preparatory Department, Normal, or Elect-
ive work, from Principal Hamilton King; and young ladies in any department,
from the Principal of the Ladies' Department, Mrs. Aurelia Burrage. Corre-
spondence may be addressed to any of the above named persons, or to George
W. Keyes, Secretary of the College.
Entrance Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of each term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present.
Candidates for advanced standing shall be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to any of the College classes, who are deficient in
three of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such
conditions are removed before the end of the year.
Certificates from Other Schools.
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies are
accepted from several high schools of the State of whose thoroughness the
Faculty have assured themselves. Students from schools on the university lis
will be admitted without examinations.


## p. 42 (#342) #############################################

42 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Satisfactory certificates from any schools of good standing are accepted for
the following studies:
Arithmetic, Geography, Civil Government, United States History, Grain-
mar, and Elementary Philosophy, Physiology, and Physical Geography.
Rules for Classifying Students in this Catalogue.
1. Students may be admitted to the Freshman class, conditioned on three
terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be
advanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year in College the character of the majority of the
studies pursued during the year determines the class in which the student shall
be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a
lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term.
At the close of the College year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees of gentlemen appointed annually by the Congregational Associa-
tion, and by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These examina-
tions are always public.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may however under the direction of the Faculty select such studies as they
prefer.
Terms and Vacations.
The College Year is divided into three terms.
Commencement occurs on the third Thursday in June.
Vacation, twelve weeks.
The First Term begins Thursday, twelve weeks from Commencement, and
continues fourteen weeks.
Vacation for the Holidays.
The Second Term begins on the first Thursday of January, and continues
twelve weeks.
Vacation, one week.
The Third Term begins on the first Thursday of April, and continues till

44 OLIVET COLLEGE.
The Museum of Natural History.
The collections of the College have lately been given new and spacious
apartments in Mather Hall. Besides a more general zoological collection,
there is on exhibition, due chiefly to the generosity of Rev. Dr. Wm. B. Brown,
a collection of 30,000 minerals, 10,000 shells, and several hundred paleonto-
logical specimens. The department of Geology is further supplied with a very
complete series of " Ward's Reproductions," the gift of Wm. B. Palmer.
The Museum has been greatly enlarged during the past year, and now con-
tains one of the most complete synoptic collections that is to be found in the
West. All museum material is for the use of the students, and is for worh
rather than for mere exhibition.
Biology and Geology.
Special attention has recently been given to the department of Biology. The
Laboratory is in direct communication with the Museum, and is supplied
with all the necessary apparatus for the demonstration of the more important
phenomena of life. As an introduction, there is prosecuted a thorough
course in the general structure and morphology of the flowering plants, the
students being supplied with material and with dissecting microscopes.
Practical work is done in the line of preparing and classifying the more
common plants, and attention is given to the study of Vegetable Physiology.
The first term in Zoology is spent in a general survey pf the subject.
Daily use is made of our large collections, and special attention is given to
comparative anatomy. The advanced course, of the second (spring) term, is
especially planned for those who intend to teach, and also for those who are
preparing themselves for the study of medicine. It is a laboratory course,
students being supplied with fresh and prepared material, and much time is
spent in the careful dissection of type animals. The latter part of the term
is spent in microscopical study, and the methods of microscopical research are
taught and followed. The Laboratory is supplied with a very complete outfit of
compound microscopes, and the past year we have imported some of the finest
glasses made. No pains are spared to give special students extra facilities for
Biological work, and already the higher institutions of the East have those who
have wished to still further pursue their work.
The advanced class in Botany is the correlative of the advanced class in
Zoology. Laboratory methods are pursued from beginning to end. Types are
carefully studied both with the simple and with the compound microscope.
Instruction is given in drawing from the microscope, and many permanent prep-
arations are made. Lower plants are studied and considerable field work is
carried on.
For the teaching of Geology the Museum presents a very complete series
of fossils and reproductions. The collection of minerals is rich. Photographs,
Models, and Field-work make the course practical.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 45
Meteorology.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have ample
opportunity to do special work in this practical science.
Chemistry.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-four students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances, and
other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
The course begins with the Fall term of the Sophomore year, and continues
one year. General Chemistry is first considered, and studied by aid of text-
book, lectures, and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed to
aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science. The
students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and learn, and
report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues through
the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and laboratory
work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative or organic, may make special
arrangements with the professor for this purpose.
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authority, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the structure
and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is of great
importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the curriculum of
study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts, models, and dis-
sections.
Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains about 16,000 volumes and 15,000 pamphlets.
Its books have been selected with care and with reference to the work of
both professors and students. Hence its growth has been healthful and adapted
to the wants of the College. In addition to other sources of income, the interest
of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually appropriated to the purchase of
books. This endowment, fifteen thousand dollars, is the gift of the late Mrs.
Lucy E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Conn., as a memorial of her gifted son, who died
at the early age of thirteen years.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 47
The Library and Reading-Room are open daily, except Sundays, to all
students. For the use of both no additional charge is made.
The College has recently received $5,000 from a nameless donor, and a
legacy of $20,000 from the late Leonard Burrage, of North Leominster, Mass.
In accordance with the well-known wishes of both these donors the aggregate
sum of $25,000 has been appropriated for the erection of a fire-proof Library
Building. Plans have already been adopted, and the erection of the building
will be commenced in the early spring.
Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies; the Soronian for
young ladies, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic for young gentlemen.
Each has a library and special assembly rooms.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association,
at No. 6 Parsons Hall, has been neatly fitted up, and affords an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Bible Study.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises are held every Friday, 6.30-7.30 P.M., and the course
of study is as follows:
Fiest Year: The study of the Bible in its more material form, as a part
of every scholar's education. Origin, preservation, grand divisions, and sub-
divisions, with relations of each to the other; authors, books, and relative
position, with name and brief analysis of each; also a simple presentation of
such questions as the term day, length of life, unity of the race, deluge, miracles,
plagues, etc., to the end of founding the student in the Christian faith, rather
than for the simple historical study.
The analysis of books this year is confined to the Old Testament.
Second Year: The same general and special work in the New Testa-
ment; together with the historical and logical connection between the Old and
New Testaments.


## p. 48 (#348) #############################################

48 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Thied Year: The study of the principal characters of the Old Testament
in the light of the Old Dispensation; and the study of the characters of the
New Testament, except Christ
.
Fourth Year: The study of Christ as set forth in the Gospels.
Fifth Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and Christian
church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Sixth Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Seventh Year: Doctrines and duties as set forth in the Old Testament
and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
Ladies' Department.
Young women in all departments of study are under the supervision of the
Principal of the Ladies' Department, and the care of the Ladies' Board.
Every young woman is required to present, once a week, a written report
of her observance of the regulations of the Department.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder of
the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teacher, and Matron,
together with accommodations for seventy-five young ladies. It is heated
by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished. It has been
enlarged by the addition of a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet,
containing a spacious dining-hall, also kitchen and laundry, besides commodious
rooms in the second story for students.
It is desirable that all young ladies from abroad should be members of the
family with the Principal and Matron in this Hall. They are allowed, however,
to secure rooms and board in approved families of the place.
Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who gave
liberally for its erection in 1866. It contains the College Office, Library, five
Recitation Rooms, and Dormitories for young men; also the rooms of the Phi
Alpha Pi and Adelphic Literary Societies, and of the Young Men's Christian
Association.
Mather Hall.
This new and commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000,
bears the name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Conn., who was its chief donor.
It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides two large Recitation Rooms, it
contains the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for Chemistry, Geology, and
Biology. It contains also the College Museum and the Signal Service Station.


## p. 49 (#349) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 49
Preparatory Department.
It is the aim of this department in its Classical, Scientific, and Literary
Courses to fit students for entrance to any of the colleges in the country; while
in its English and Normal Courses it is designed to meet the needs of students
whose circumstances do not permit them to take a complete College Course)
yet who wish to make the most of opportunities within their reach to fit them-
selves for useful manhood aud womanhood. To this end experienced teachers
only are employed, each a specialist in his line. Students therefore receive
thorough training in foundation work in English history, mathematics, natural
sciences, and the classics; and the stimulating effect of their association with
the students of older and higher classes is shown in the quality of the work done
in the class room.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and table board for young men and women can be had at the College
halls or in private families, as preferred. Young women proposing to live in
private families are expected to consult with the Principal before engaging their
boarding-places.
In private families, table board and furnished rooms range in price from
$2.50 to $4.50 a week, fuel and lights included. Table board in Shipherd Hall
may be had at present for $2.oo a week. Room rent for unfurnished rooms in
Parsons Hall is from $2.50 to $3.75 a term. Students who are willing to live
plainly reduce their expenses by boarding in clubs; the price of club board has
for the past three years ranged from $1.50 to $1.90 a week. With the practice
of economy in all expenditures, one hundred dollars, added to the earnings of one
or two hours' work a day, can be made to meet all necessary expenses for a
College year.
Board and Rooms in Shipherd Hall.
Board, with room furnished for two, from $2.75 to $3.50 for each student,
varying with location of room.
Board, with room furnished for one, from $3.50 to $375-
These prices include fuel and lights. The rooms are in all respects
arranged for two.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the board as near cost as possible,
and these prices will vary with the prices of provisions.
The charge for washing is fifty cents a dozen. Those who do their own
washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents a term for the use of the
laundry.
Every student furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips, her towels and
napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick boots, overshoes, and
water-proof cloak.
Expenses.
Tuition in College classes is $7.00 a term; in Preparatory classes, $5.00
to $7.00 a term.


## p. 50 (#350) #############################################

50 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No deduction
will be made for absence, except in case of protracted sickness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music and
Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $3.00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Treasurer's
receipt for them is the student's warrant for entering classes.
By the formation of clubs the cost of board is reduced nearly one half.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.—To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred.
Necessary Expenses.— The following may be considered a near estimate

Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to remit
the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing for the
ministry of any evangelical denomination, and wlio by scholarship and character
proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not extend to the incidental
charge, to room rent, or to the tuition in any study outside of the regular
course.
Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of Presbytery to the amount of $ioo to $132 a year.
Members of the College classes whose necessities require it may be absent
two terms of their course for the purpose of teaching. They will be required
to pass examination in the studies pursued by their classes during their absence.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily need to leave College for lach of means.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find
employment about the College or in the village for themselves with satisfactory
compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies. A limited
number of the young ladies at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of their board by
assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the homes of the village.
A few students, by rigid economy and hard work, meet all their expenses from
their earnings while studying, but in such cases health and studies are likely to
suffer. No one should come, even for one term, without at least thirty or forty
dollars at his command for use if needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few
students, as provided for elsewhere, and the College has funds for otherwise
aiding to some extent certain classes of needy students. The great advantage
Olivet College offers students of this class, however, is the very low rate at
which all its facilities are furnished. The traditions of the College, and the
public sentiment of the students, favor economy in all living expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
When a student occupying a room in College is to be absent from town
more than two weeks, he shall leave his key, with label attached, at the Treas
urer's office, under penalty of forfeiting his room.


## p. 52 (#352) #############################################

52 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be retained unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required exercise.
Ladies and gentlemen are never allowed to call at each other's rooms
except in cases of severe illness, and then only by special permission.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution, by-laws, and usages of all societies of undergraduates shall
be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Girls and boys under fifteen years of age will not be received unless by
special arrangement.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago ft Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.
For Catalogues and other information, address Pres. H. Q. Butterfield,
Mrs. Aurelia Burrage, Prin. Hamilton King, or George W. Keyes, Secretary
of the College.

ART DEPARTMENT.
It is the object of this department to develop in the student's mind a
correct idea of form, as well as an appreciation of the beautiful; also to train
the powers of observation until the students are capable of working independ-
ently from life and sketching from nature.
A thorough understanding of the principles of drawing is followed by the
study of form from simple models and casts, afterwards studies in still life,
sketching from nature, and the study of the human form. The following will
give an idea of the work pursued:
Pencil Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four lessons.
This comprises the fundamental principles of drawing, working from the flat,
followed by the study of form or extension, from simple objects, models, and
casts.
Mechanical Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four
lessons.
Charcoal Drawing includes drawing from the cast and still life studies.
A good assortment of casts of leaves, fruit, fragments of the human form, etc.,
has been provided for this work-
Crayon Drawing— Finished pictures and crayon portraits.
China Painting embraces the decorating of porcelain, vases, tiles, etc., in
mineral colors. Gilding is also done. A portable kiln has been provided for
the firing of porcelain.
Oil and Water Colors — Studies in still life, landscapes, flowers, figures,
etc.
Students wishing to make Art a specialty can have instruction and the use
of the Art Room and models, daily.
A term's work comprises twenty-four lessons, each two hours long.
Tuition to be paid in advance, and no deduction is made for absence from
lessons except in cases of sickness.
During Commencement week there is an exhibition of work done during
the year, and it is necessary that the work be either left in the studio or sent
back at that time.

MICHIGAN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
This Conservatory offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical —either exclusively or with other studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The course of study is comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
The Piano.Forte.
In the study of this instrument, great attention is given to every detail of
Technique. Especial care is taken to develop a truly musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.
The following is an outline of the studies pursued, the teacher selecting
those which may be most profitably used by the pupil. Four years is the time
usually needed for its completion, but this will depend wholly upon the capacity
and progress of the individual.

A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter octaves
of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to be obtained
at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ Playing, particu-
lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church
Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Concert Music, with special
attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn. Pupils, when advanced, are
afforded practical experience in accompanying the Choir in Chorus and Quartette.

tions embrace a wide range of the finest compositions for the Organ.


## p. 63 (#363) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music.
A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Harmony," Richter's "Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's " Instrumen-
tation."
History of Music.
A series of lectures on this subject will be given every year by the Director.
The text-book used is the " History of Music," by Langhaus.
Cultivation of the Voice.
The instruction in Voice Culture embraces careful training in the control of
the breath, and the use of the vocal organs for the production of a pure tone
and distinct enunciation.
Voices are not strained or abnormally developed, but cultivated and ex-
panded in accordance with their natural capacities. Hence the progress is
rapid and thorough. Great attention is given to singing at sight.
Vocalises by Panofka, Concone, and others, together with songs, ballads,
opera and oratorio selections, are used for the formation of method and cultiva-
tion of style.
Cabinet Organ.
In the study of this instrument, pupils are instructed in playing Church
Music, Voluntaries, etc., great care being taken not only that the pupil shall be
familiar with all the resources of the instrument, but also, having completed the
course of study, shall be fully prepared to undertake the study of the Pipe Organ.
Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been insti-
tuted: Organ Recitals, Piano Recitals, and Exhibition Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of musical art. The Exhibition Concerts
occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the progress
and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a high order, and have received
great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals take
place every Friday afternoon, at which time pupils perform vocal and instru-
mental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as they


## p. 64 (#364) #############################################

64 OLIVET COLLEGE
afford an opportunity of playing before others. All the friends and pupils of
the Conservatory are invited to attend.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.
The Normal and College singing classes meet twice a week, and are free to all

Literary Requirements.
i. Candidates for graduation are required to pass examination in the fol-
lowing studies, or their equivalents: Algebra to the amount of two terms' work
in the College; German, three terms; French, two terms; Rhetoric, one term;
Acoustics, Art, English Literature, one term; and Evidences of Christianity.
They are also required to attend Rhetorical Classes during their course in the
Conservatory.
2. Transient students in the Conservatory are recommended to elect one
study each term in one of the College courses.
3. Free tuition is granted in one study each term, in any of the College
courses, to every musical student who takes two regular studies in the Con-
servatory.
Examinations.
Upon entering the Conservatory, students will be examined in the various
branches to be studied. To facilitate examination, each pupil should be pre-
pared to give a full statement of previous courses of study which may have
been pursued, and to play or sing two or more well-practiced pieces as examples
of attainment, besides scales and exercises.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 65
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of protracted
sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the pupil.
Those who substitute Music for any study in the Literary Course are required
to devote at least two hours a dav to the study of the Piano, Organ, or Vocal
Music, and to pursue the study of Theory for three terms.
Terms in the Conservatory correspond with those in the College.
Pupils in the Conservatory are subject to the regulations of the College.
Diplomas are awarded to those who complete the course and attain the

three years' study of Theory will be required for graduation. Those making
Theory a specialty will be required to pursue the study four years.
In some cases members of the Conservatory have been able to pay a part
of their expenses by suitable employment. Such aid will be furnished as far as
possible to any who may need and require it. All persons desiring musical
instruction are encouraged and assisted in every possible way.
In every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be cheerfully
recommended for positions as Teachers and Organists.

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, at their annual session in
June, 1870, the Treasurer is directed to publish annually in the catalogue a full
statement of all contributions to the College, and the names and residences of
the contributors. But donations to the College in the form of real estate or
personal notes are not included in this list until they are converted into cash.
The subjoined is such a statement, covering the period extending from
November 6, 1887, to November 5, 1888, but does not include payments of
interest. This statement is designed to be fully correct and particular. Should,
however, any person discover any omission or error in this record of benevolence
to the College, he will confer a great favor by promptly pointing out the same to
the Treasurer or President of the College.

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year, students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for anv
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, Greek Grammar and Composition, and Roman
and Greek History; past experience shows that the candidate is liable to over-
estimate his attainments in these subjects. General information must not be
regarded as an equivalent for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for
systematic drill in the forms and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH COURSE.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" following. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 41
GENERAL INFORMATION.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions of
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
Students will be amenable to the regulations of the College from the time
of their arrival.
Every student is entitled to an honorable dismission whenever it is
demanded, provided no arrearages stand charged to him on the Treasurer's
books, and no delinquency appears on the records of the Faculty.
When a student's influence is found to be bad, the Faculty may separate
him from the College without making formal charges.
Preliminary Arrangements.
On reaching town for the first time young men entering the College classes
may obtain any needed information from President H. Q. Butterfield; young men
in the Preparatory Department, Normal, or Elective work, from Principal
Hamilton King; and young ladies in any department, from the Principal of
the Ladies' Department, Mrs. Aurelia Burrage. Correspondence may be
addressed to any of the above named persons, or to George W. Keyes,
Secretary of the College.
Entrance Examinations.
Candidates for admission to any course are examined on the first Thursday
of each term, at which time it is especially desirable that all should be present.
Candidates for advanced standing shall be examined in the subjects studied
by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to any of the College classes, who are deficient in
three of the prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such
conditions are removed before the end of the year.
Certificates from Other Schools.
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies are
accepted from several high schools of the State of whose thoroughness the
Faculty have assured themselves. Students from schools on the University list
will be admitted without examinations.


## p. 42 (#420) #############################################

42 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Satisfactory certificates from any schools of good standing are accepted for
the following studies:
Arithmetic Geography, Civil Government, United States History, Gram-
mar, and Elementary Philosophy, Physiology, and Physical Geography.
Rules for Classifying Students in this Catalogue.
1. Students may be admitted to the Freshman class, conditioned on three
terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be
advanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year in College the character of the majority of the
studies pursued during the year determines the class in which the student shall
be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a
lower class, or suspended.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is sent
to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each term.
At the close of the College year all the classes are examined in the presence of
committees appointed annually by the Congregational Association, and by the
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These examinations are always
public.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the systematic
prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this catalogue;
they may however, under the direction of the Faculty, elect such studies as they
prefer.
Terms and Vacations.
The College Year is divided into three terms.
Commencement occurs on the third Thursday in June.
Vacation, thirteen weeks.

44 OLIVET COLLEGE.
The Museum of Natural History.
The collections of the College have lately been given new and spacious
apartments in Mather Hall. Besides a more general zoological collection,
there is on exhibition, due chiefly to the generosity of Rev. Dr. Wm. B. Brown,
a co'iection of 30,000 minerals, 10,000 shells, and several hundred paleonto-
logies! specimens. The department of Geology is further supplied with a very
complete series of " Ward's Reproductions," the gift of Wm. B. Palmer.
The Museum has been greatly enlarged during the past year, and now con-
tains one of the most complete synoptic collections that is to be found in the
West. All museum material is for the use of the students, and is for worh
rather than for mere exhibition.
Biology and Geology.
Special attention has recently been given to the department of Biology. The
Laboratory is in direct communication with the Museum, and is supplied
with all the necessary apparatus for the demonstration of the more important
phenomena of life. As an introduction, there is prosecuted a thorough
course in the general structure and morphology of the flowering plants, the
students being supplied with material and with dissecting microscopes.
Practical work is done in the line of preparing and classifying the more
common plants, and attention is given to the study of Vegetable Physiology.
The first term in Zoology is .spent in a general survey of the subject.
Daily use is made of our large collections, and special attention is given to
comparative anatomy. The advanced course, of the second (spring) term, is
especially planned for those who intend to teach, and also for those who are
preparing themselves for the study of medicine. It is a laboratory course,
students being supplied with fresh and prepared material, and much time is
spent in the careful dissection of type animals. The latter part of the term
is spent in microscopical study, and the methods of microscopical research are
taught and followed. The Laboratory is supplied with a very complete outfit of
compound microscopes, and the past year we have imported some of the finest
glasses made. No pains are spared to give special students extra facilities for
Biological work, and already the higher institutions of the East have those who
have wished to still further pursue their work.
The advanced class in Botany is the correlative of the advanced class in
Zoology. Laboratory methods are pursued from beginning to end. Types are
carefully studied both with the simple and with the compound microscope.
Instruction is Riven in drawing from the microscope, and many permanent prep,
arations are made. Lower plants are studied and considerable field work is
carried on.
For the teaching of Geology the Museum presents a very complete series
of fossils and reproductions. The collection of minerals is rich. Photographs,
Models, and Field-work make the course practical.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 45
Meteorology.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have ample
opportunity to do special work in this practical science.
Chemistry.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-four students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances, and
other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
The course begins with the Fall term of the Sophomore year, and continues
one year. General Chemistry is first considered, and studied by aid of text-
book, lectures, and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed to
aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science. The
students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and learn, and
report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues through
the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and laboratory
work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative or organic, may make special
arrangements for this purpose.
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authoritv, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the structure
and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is of great
importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the curriculum of
study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts, models, and dis-
sections.
During the past year there have been added a series of the Auzoux models,
consisting of a manikin, and enlarged models of the eye, ear, brain, cerebellum
and cord, larynx, etc.
Science Library.
An important step has been taken in laying the foundations of a much
needed reference library of scientific books, for the use of the science depart-
ments. This is to be located permanently in Mather Hall.

OLIVE! COLLEGE.
Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains 16,500 volumes, and also a large collection of
pamphlets. Its books have been selected with care, and with reference to the
work of both professors and students. Hence its growth has been healthful,
and adapted to the wants of the College. In addition to other sources of
income, the interest of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually devoted to the
purchase of books. This endowment, (15,000, is the gift of the late Mrs. Lucy
E. Tuttle of Guilford, Connecticut, as a memorial of her gifted son, whose
name it bears.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Dewey system.
A card catalogue, both of authors and subjects, makes every book and its
contents easily accessible to every reader. Each student is allowed free access
to the shelves, also the privilege of drawing books from the Library. The
Library is open six hours daily, except Sundays.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, well supplied with the
leading journals of news, politics, religion, science, literature, and art. The
following is a list of the periodicals to be found upon its tables:

The corner stone of Burrage Hall, the new home of the Library, was laid
at the last annual Commencement, and the structure will soon be complete.
It takes its name from its chief donor, the late Leonard Burrage of North
Leominister, Massachusetts. It is an elegant building of Ionia sandstone,
commodious and convenient in its arrangement and appointments, and with a
capacity for about 100,000 volumes. The stack room, which will contain the
greater part of the books, is fire-proof, and all parts of the building are virtually
so. It thus affords a safe repository for the Library, and invites all friends of
the College to make frequent and large additions to the present valuable collec-
tion. Gifts of books, manuscripts, pamphlets, and periodicals of any kind, are
very acceptable. Local histories, anniversary addresses, the literature of insti-
tutions, all documents relating to American life and history, are especially
desired. Here they may be safely preserved, and classified for future use.
Former students and all friends of the College can do much to assist the
librarian in this work. Correspondence is respectfully solicited. The cost of
transportation will be borne by the College on such donations as can be used.
Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies; the Soronian for
young ladies, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic for young gentlemen.
Each has a library and special assembly rooms.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.

48 OLIVET COLLEGE.
The new Reading-Room of the Young Men's Christian Association,
at No. 6 Parsons Hall, has been neatly fitted up, and affords an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and adds much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Bible Study.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises are held every Friday, 8.00-9.00 a.m., and the course
of study is as follows:
Fiest Year: The study of the Bible in its more material form, as a part
of every scholar's education. Origin, preservation, grand divisions, and sub-
divisions, with relations of each to the other; authors, books, and relative
position, with name and brief analysis of each; also a simple presentation of
such questions as the term day, length of life, unity of the race, deluge, miracles,
plagues, etc., to the end of founding the student in the Christian faith, as well
as for the historical study.
The analysis of books this year is confined to the Old Testament.
Second Year: The same general and special work in the New Testa-
ment; together with the historical and logical connection between the Old and
New Testaments.
Thied Year: The study of the principal characters of the Old Testament
in the light of the Old Dispensation; and the study of the characters of the
New Testament, except Christ.
Fourth Year: The study of Christ as set forth in the Gospels.
Fifth Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and Christian
church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Sixth Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Seventh Year: Doctrines and accompanying duties as set forth in the
Old Testament and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
Ladies' Department.
Young women in all departments of study are under the supervision of the
Principal of the Ladies' Department, and the care of the Ladies' Board.
Every young woman is required to present, once a week, a written report
of her observance of the regulations of the Department.
It is desirable that all young ladies from abroad should be members of the
family with the Principal and Matron in Shipherd Hall. They are allowed,
however, to secure rooms and board in approved families of the place.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder of
the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teacher, and Matron,
together with accommodations for seventy-five young ladies. It is heated
by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished. It has re-

cently been enlarged by the addition of a substantial brick structure, sixty-five
by forty feet, containing a spacious Dining-Hall, also Kitchen and Laundry, be-
sides commodious rooms in the second story for students.
This hall is under the control of the Lady Principal and a senate of young
ladies elected by the young ladies of the hall.
Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who gave
liberally for its erection in 1866. It contains the College Office, Library, five
Recitation Rooms, the Signal Service Station, and Dormitories for young men;
also the rooms of the Phi Alpha Pi and Adelphic Literary Societies, and of the
Young Men's Christian Association.
This hall is under the control of one of the professors, who rooms in the
building, and a senate of young gentlemen elected by the young gentlemen of
the hall.
Mather Hall.
This new and commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000,
bears the name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Conn., who was its chief donor.
It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides two large Recitation Rooms, it
contains the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for Chemistry, Geology, and
Biology. It contains also the College Museum.
Adelphic Society Building.
This building, which is to be the home of the Society whose name it bears,
promises to be the most attractive structure on the College Campus. It is a
gem of the monumental style of architecture, built of field stone, and when
furnished will cost about $12,000. It contains an Auditorium, Reception
Rooms, and Cloak Rooms on the first floor; a Library, Committee Rooms,
and Janitor's Room on the second floor.
Gymnasium.
This building is a wooden structure, thirty-six by seventy-five feet, and
twenty-five feet post. It contains two Bowling Alleys, Dressing-Rooms, Baths,
and Janitor's Room, on the first floor; and a spacious hall, the size of the
entire building, sixteen feet ceiling, on the second floor. The Gymnasium is
furnished with modern equipment throughout. A well developed course in
Physical Culture, under the direction of an experienced teacher, is now offered to
the students of the College.

Conservatory Building.
This is a wooden structure purchased in connection with the property on
which the new Library building now stands, and has been entirely remodeled
and newly furnished during the past year. It contains a commodious hall for
the general exercises of the Conservatory, a large room for Vocal Instruction, a
room for Piano Practice, and Janitor's Room.
Preparatory Department.
It is the aim of this department in its Classical, Scientific and Literary
Courses, to fit students for entrance to any of the colleges in the country; while
in its English and Normal Courses it is designed to meet the needs of students
whose circumstances do not permit them to take a complete College Course,
yet who wish to make the most of opportunities within their reach to fit them-
selves for useful manhood and womanhood. To this end experienced teachers
fnly are employed, each a specialist in his line. Students therefore receive
thorough training in foundation work in English, History, Mathematics, Natural
Sciences, and the Classics; and the stimulating effect of their association with
the students of older and higher classes is shown in the quality of the work done
in the class room.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and table board for young men and women can be had at the College
halls or in private families, as preferred. Young women proposing to live in
private families are expected to consult with the Principal before engaging their
boarding-places.
In private families, table board and furnished rooms range in price from
$2.50 to $4.50 a week, fuel and lights included. Table board in Shipherd Hall
may be had at present for $2.00 a week. Room rent for unfurnished rooms in
Parsons Hall is from 19 to 58 cents a week for two students. Students who
are willing to live plainly reduce their expenses by boarding in clubs; the price
of club board has for the past three years ranged from $1.25 to $1.90 a week.
With the practice of economy in all expenditures, one hundred dollars, added to
the earnings of one or two hours' work a day, can be made to meet all necessary
expenses for a College year.
Board and Rooms in Shipherd Hall.
Board, with room fuinished for two, from £2.75 to $3.50 for each student,
varying with location of room.
Board, with room furnished for one, from $3.50 to $3.75. These prices
include fuel and lights.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the board as near cost as possible,
and these prices may vary as necessity requires.

The charge for washing is fifty cents a dozen. Those who do their own
washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents a term for the use of the
laundry.
Every student furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips, her towels and
napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick boots, overshoes, and
water-proof cloak.
Expenses.
Tuition in College classes is $7.00 a term; in Preparatory classes, $5.00
to $7.00 a term.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No deduction
will be made for absence, except in case of protracted sickness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music and
Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $3.00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Treasurer's
receipt for them is the student's warrant for entering classes.
By the formation of clubs the cost of board is reduced nearly one half.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.— To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred.
Necessary Expenses.— The following may be considered a near estimate
of the necessary expenses of a student for an average term of twelve weeks.
It is made upon the supposition that two students occupy the same room:

Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to remit
the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing for the
ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship and character
proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not extend to the incidental
charge, to room rent, or to the tuition in any study outside of the regular
course.
Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of Presbytery to the amount of $100 to $132 a year.
Members of the College classes whose necessities require it may be absent
two terms of their course for the purpose of teaching. They will be required
to pass examination in the studies pursued by their classes during their absence.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
A'o worthy student will ordinarily need to leave Colloge for lach 0fmeans.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find
employment for themselves about the College or in the village with satisfactory
compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies. A limited
number of the young ladies at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of their board by
assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the homes of the village.
A few students, by rigid economy and hard work, meet all their expenses from
their earnings while studying, but in such cases health and studies are likely to
suffer. No one should come, even for one term, without at least thirty or forty
dollars at his command for use if needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few

students, as provided for elsewhere, and the College has funds for otherwise
aiding to some extent certain classes of needy students. The great advantage
Olivet College offers students of this class, however, is the very low rate at
which all its facilities are furnished. The traditions of the College, and the
public sentiment of the students, favor economy in all expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
When a student occupying a room in College is to be absent from town
more than two weeks, he shall leave his key, with label attached, at the Secre-
tary's office, under penalty of forfeiting his room.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be retained unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required exercise.
Ladies and gentlemen are never allowed to call at each other's rooms
except in cases of severe illness, and then only by special permission.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution, by-laws, and usages of all societies of undergraduates shall
be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Girls and boys under fifteen years of age will not ba received unless by
special arrangement.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char-
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.
For Catalogues and other information, address President H. Q. Butter
field, Mrs. Aurelia Burrage, Principal Hamilton King, or George W. Keyes
Secretary of the College.

ART DEPARTMENT.
It is the object of this department to develop in the student's mind a
correct idea of form, as well as an appreciation of the beautiful; also to train
the powers of observation until the students are capable of working independ-
ently from life and sketching from nature.
A thorough understanding of the principles of drawing is followed by the
study of form from simple models and casts, afterwards studies in still life,
sketching from nature, and the study of the human form. The following will
give an idea of the work pursued:
Pencil Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four lessons.
This comprises the fundamental principles of drawing, working from the flat,
followed by the study of form or extension, from simple objects, models, and
casts.
Mechanical Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four
lessons.
Charcoal Drawing includes drawing from the cast and still life studies.
A good assortment of casts of leaves, fruit, fragments of the human form, etc.,
has been provided for this work.
Crayon Drawing — Finished pictures and crayon portraits.
China Painting embraces the decorating of porcelain, vases, tiles, etc., in
mineral colors. Gilding is also done. A portable kiln has been provided for
the firing of porcelain.
Oil and Water Colors — Studies in still life, landscapes, flowers, figures,
etc.
Students wishing to make Art a specialty can have instruction and the use
of the Art Room and models, daily.
A term's work comprises twenty-four lessons, each two hours long.
Tuition to be paid in advance, and no deduction is made for absence from
lessons except in case of sickness.
During Commencement week there is an exhibition of work done during
the year, hence it is necessary that the work be either left in the studio until
then or sent back at that time.

OLIVET CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
INSTRUCTION.
This School of Music offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical —either exclusively or with other studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The courses of study are comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
Four courses of study are offered.
1. A course in Piano, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
2. A course in Pipe Organ, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
3. A course in Vocal Music, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
4. A course combining work belonging to the three preceding courses.
A full course will take between four and five years. Talented students, with
diligence, may finish it in four years.
Being connected with the College, a double advantage is given the student
for musical and mental improvement, and it is the aim of the management to
encourage and urge the musical student to such studies as English Literature,
Rhetoric, Modern Languages, and History.
Who May Enter.
Students may enter without taking either of the Regular Courses, and may
pursue such a line of work and to such an extent as the teacher may direct.
Students who wish to enter any of the Regular Courses should have finished
the studies preparing for the Scientific and Literary Course of the College.
(See page 35.)
The Pianoforte.
In the study of this instrument great attention is given to every detail of
technique. Especial care is taken to develop a true musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.

The Pipe Organ.
Students desiring to study the Pipe Organ should have finished at least the
third grade of Piano Playing (see page 60).
A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter octaves
of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to be obtained
at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ Playing, particu-
lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church
Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Concert Music, with special
attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn. Pupils, when advanced, are
afforded practical experience in accompanying the Choir in Chorus and Quartette.

Cultivation of the Voice.
The aim of this Department is to acquire a mastery over the production and
management of sound in singing.
Especial attention is given to a healthy and skillful management of the
breath; the production of a clear, full, and resonant tone, free from the throat;
distinct enunciation, the art of phrasing correctly, and the development of a
refined musical taste.

cises and Solfeggios. Phrasing, Songs from German, French, and Italian

Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music.
A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Harmony," Richter's "Treatise on Counterpoint," and Berlioz's " Instrumen-
tation."

lowing studies, or their equivalents: Algebra to the amount of two terms' work
in the College; German, three terms; French, two terms; Rhetoric, one term;
Acoustics, Art, English Literature, one term; and Evidences of Christianity.
They are also required to attend College Rhetorical Classes during three years

Free tuition is granted in one study each term, in any of the College courses,
to every musical student who pays not less than $24.00 for tuition in the
Conservatory.
Examinations.
Upon entering the Conservatory, students will be examined in the various
branches to be studied. To facilitate examination, each pupil should be pre-
pared to give a full statement of previous courses of study which may have
been pursued, and to play or sing two or more well-practiced pieces as examples
of attainment, besides scales and exercises.

Concerts and Students' Rehearsals.
The following are the several courses of Concerts which have been insti-
tuted: Organ Recitals and Piano Recitals, and Exhibition Concerts.
The two former courses afford pupils opportunity for becoming acquainted
with many of the finest works of musical art. The Exhibition Concerts
occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the progress
and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a high order, and have received
great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals take
place every Monday evening, at which time pupils perform vocal and instru-
mental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as they
afford an opportunity of playing before others.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.
The Normal and College singing classes meet twice a week, and are free to all
students. The Musical Guild, a society formed of, and managed by, students
of the Conservatory, meets every Monday. Its programmes consist of Instru-
mental and Vocal Selections, Essays, and Criticism on Music.
Miscellaneous Items.
Besides the Music Rooms in the Conservatory Building, the Conservatory
has the use of the College Church for the Pipe Organ, the College Church and
five rooms in the College buildings for piano practice, and the private rooms of
the Director.
Names must be registered and tuition paid before lessons are assigned.
Pupils are not received for a shorter period than one term.
Pupils must furnish or hire suitable instruments for practice. Instruments
can be hired at the College buildings and in the village.
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of protracted
sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the pupil.
Before a student can substitute Music for any study in the Literary Course,
he must have passed Grade II in Piano or Vocal work, or Grade I in the study
of the Pipe Organ; must have pursued the study of Theory for three terms; and
is required to devote at least two hours a day to the study of the Piano, Organ,
or Vocal Music.
Terms in the Conservatory commence with those in the College.
Pupils in the Conservatory are subject to the regulations of the College.
Diplomas are awarded to those who complete the course and attain the
standard for graduation on recommendation of the College Faculty.

of their expenses by suitable employment. Such aid will be furnished as far as
possible to any who may need it. All persons desiring musical instruction

In every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be cheerfully
recommended for positions as Teachers and Organists.

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, at their annual session in
June, 1870, the Treasurer is directed to publish annually in the Catalogue a full
statement of all contributions to the College, and the names and residences of
the contributors. But donations to the College in the form of real estate or
personal notes are not included in this list until they are converted into cash.
The subjoined is such a statement, covering the period extending from
November 6, 1888, to November 1, 1889, but does not include payments of
interest. This statement is designed to be fully correct and particular. Should,
however, any person discover any omission or error in this record of benevolences
to the College, he will confer a great favor by promptly pointing out the same to
the Treasurer or President of the College.

COURSES OF STUDY.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
CLASSICAL COURSE.
In order to pursue profitably the studies of the Junior Year, students
should be well grounded in Modern Geography, the elements of English
Grammar, and Arithmetic through Decimal Fractions. A much greater
proficiency in English studies is found to be of great advantage.
The completion of the Course of Study prepares the student for any
college. It is of the greatest advantage that the student enter the department
at the beginning of the course. Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin
Grammar and Composition, Greek Grammar and Composition, and Roman
and Greek History; past experience shows that the candidate is liable to over-
estimate his attainments in these subjects. General information must not be
regarded as an equivalent for technical scholarship; nor mere translation for
systematic drill in the forms and usages of language.
Examinations, conducted in writing, are held in each study once, at least,
in each term; and near the close of the year with reference to promotion
and graduation. Promotion and graduation are secured only by those who-
give satisfactory evidence of the requisite proficiency.

ENGLISH COURSE.
The course of instruction in this Department is designed to impart a thorough
knowledge of the common and higher branches of an English education. Stu-
dents are prepared for the best Scientific Schools, by substituting Latin or
French, as required, for equivalent studies. Students who honorably complete
the first three years may receive a certificate for presentation to Scientific
Schools. The preparation required for admission is indicated by the "Course
of Study" following. The studies of the third and fourth years are not pursued
as elementary studies.
The College is provided with apparatus for illustrating the principles of
Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, and instruction is given in its use. It has
also a valuable set of instruments for Practical Surveying and Civil Engineer-
ing. The Laboratory is fitted with desks and apparatus for practical work by
the students, both in General Chemistry and in Chemical Analysis.

terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be
advanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year in College the character of the majority of the
studies pursued during the year determines the class in which the student shall
be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted, and
the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given to his parent or guardian and to the student himself.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded to a

The Museum of Natural History.
The second floor of Mather Hall is devoted to the College Museum and
the Biological Laboratory. The former consists of a general zoological collec-
tion, synoptically arranged, illustrating all forms of animal life; the Brown
Cabinet of Mineralogy and Conchology, containing over 30,000 specimens; the
Botanical Museum, and the Palmer series of "Ward's Reproductions."
During the past year the most valuable additions to the Museum have been
the series of Glass Models of Invertebrates made by Blaschka, of Berlin, and
the sets of North American Hepaticae and Canadian Mosses. The whole
Museum is arranged so as to be of the greatest practical value to the students,
and is for worh rather than for mere exhibition.
Biology and Geology.
In Biology the following courses are offered:
I. General Morphology of Invertebrates. Laboratory Work, with lec-
tures, ten hours, Second Term.
II. General Morphology of Vertebrates. Continuation of Course I, eight
hours, Third Term.
III. Elements of Vertebrate Histology and Embryology. Laboratory Work,
with lectures, two hours, Third Term. To be taken with II.
IV. Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany. Laboratory and Field
Work, with lectures, ten hours, Third Term.
V. Cryptogamic Botany. Laboratory and Field Work, with lectures, eight
hours, First Term.
VI. Physiological Botany. Lectures and Laboratory Work, two hours,
First Term. To be taken with V.
The Laboratory is fully equipped with apparatus and material, and is in
direct communication with the Museum, so that constant reference may be made
to its collections. During the past year extensive additions have been made to
the equipment, so that the Laboratory now possesses twenty-five compound, and
twenty-four dissecting microscopes of the make of Zeiss, Leitz and Zentmayer;
Thoma and Minot microtomes, and a full line of first-class accessories. The
standard reference works and journals are provided for the students' use in
the Laboratory. For those who wish to carry their work farther than given
in the above courses, special arrangements will be made.
In Geology, at present, but one course is offered, consisting of Recitations,
Lectures, and Field Work. The large Mineralogical and Paleontological col-
lections of the Museum, Casts, Photographs, Models, Maps, etc., are daily used.
Two Journal Clubs are maintained, one in Biology, the other in Geology,
for the discussion of current literature, and the encouragement of original
investigation.

Meteorology.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have ample
opportunity to do special work in this practical science.
Chemistry.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-four students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances, and
other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
The course begins with the Fall term of the Sophomore year, and continues
one year. General Chemistry is first considered, and studied by aid of text-
book, lectures, and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed to
aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science. The
students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and learn, and
report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues through
the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and laboratory
work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative or organic, may make special
arrangements for this purpose.
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authority, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the structure
and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is of great
importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the curriculum of
study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts, models, and dis-
sections.
During the past year there has been added a series of the Auzoux models,
consisting of a manikin, and enlarged models of the eye, ear, brain, cerebellum
and cord, larynx, etc.
Science Library.
An important step has been taken in laying the foundations of a much
needed reference library of scientific books, for the use of the science depart-
ments. This is to be located permanently in Mather Hall.

Library and Reading-Room.
The College Library contains 18,000 volumes, and also a large collection of
pamphlets. Its books have been selected with care, and with reference to the
work of both professors and students. Hence its growth has been healthful,
and adapted to the wants of the College. In addition to other sources of
income, the interest of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually devoted to the
purchase of books. This endowment, $15,000, is the gift of the late Mrs. Lucy
E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Connecticut, as a memorial of her gifted son, whose
name it bears.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Dewey system.
A card catalogue, both of authors and subjects, makes every book and its
contents easily accessible to every reader. Each student is allowed free access
to the shelves, also the privilege of drawing books from the Library. The
Library is open seven hours daily, except Sundays.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, supplied with over one
hundred periodicals and leading journals of news, politics, religion, science,
literature, and art. These may be consulted, but cannot be withdrawn from the
Library.
The new Library building, Burrage Hall, was dedicated at the last annual
Commencement. It takes its name from the late Leonard Burrage, of Leomin-
ster, Massachusetts. The building is of the Romanesque style of architecture,
11o feet in length by 52 feet in breadth, and has a capacity for about 100,000
volumes. The substructure is of field-stone — granite bowlders — massive and
solid; the superstructure, of Ionia sandstone, warmer in color, and more sus-
ceptible to the touches of art. The interior is finished in natural oak, and the
walls simply decorated in warm Tuscan colors. The first floor contains the
Delivery Room, Librarian's Office, two Cloak Rooms, Reading Room, and Stack
Room. Above is a Mezzanine Room for cataloguing, a large Seminary Room,
and a room for Special Collections.
Burrage Hall is commodious, elegant, and complete in its appointments,
literally fire-proof in the stack room, and practically so throughout. It happily
combines economy and convenience in its working arrangements, security for
the books, attractive, well-furnished and well-lighted rooms for its readers, and
the possibility of enlargement at moderate expense and without change of the
original plan. It thus affords a safe and permanent repository for the Library,
and invites all friends of the College to make frequent and large additions to
the present valuable collection. Gifts of books, manuscripts, pamphlets, and
periodicals are very acceptable. Local histories, anniversary addresses, the
literature of institutions, and all documents relating to American life and his
tory are especially desired.
Former students and all friends of the College can do much to assist the
librarian in this work. Correspondence is respectfully solicited. The cost of
transportation will be borne by the Library on such donations as can be used.


## p. 48 (#512) #############################################

50 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies: the Soronian for
young ladies, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic for young gentlemen.
The Adelphic Society has a fine hall. The Phi Alpha Pi has a hall in process
of erection, and the Soronian Society occupies assembly rooms in Shipherd
Hall.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the College
Chapel, and public religious worship twice on Sunday. Unless special request
is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students are required to
attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by the
students during the College year.
The' Young Men's Christian Association occupies a commodious suite of
rooms in Parsons Hall. These are neatly fitted up, and afford an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and add much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.
Bible Study.
All students are required to attend weekly exercises for the study of the
Bible. These exercises are held every Friday, 11.00 a.m.-12.00 M., and the
. course of study is as follows:
Fiest Year: The study of the Bible in its more material form, as a part
of every scholar's education. Origin, preservation, grand divisions and sub-
divisions, with relations of each to the other; authors, books, and relative
position, with name and brief analysis of each; also a simple presentation of
such questions as the term day, length of life, unity of the race, deluge, miracles,
plagues, etc., to the end of founding the student in the Christian faith, as well
as for the historical study.
The analysis of books this year is confined to the Old Testament.
Second Year: The same general and special work in the Ntwi Testa-
ment; together with the historical and logical connection between the Old and
New Testaments.
Thied Year: The study of the principal characters of the Old Testament
in the light of the Old Dispensation; and the study of the characters of the
New Testament, except Christ.
Fourth Year: The study of Christ as set forth in the Gospels.

Church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Sixth Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Seventh Year: Doctrines and accompanying duties as set forth in the
Old Testament and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
Ladies' Department.
Young women in all departments of study are under the supervision of the
Principal of the Ladies' Department, and the care of the Ladies' Board.
Every young woman is required to present, once a week, a written report
of her observance of the regulations of the Department.
It is desirable that all young ladies from abroad should be members of the
family with the Principal and Matron in Shipherd Hall. They are allowed,
however, to secure rooms and board in approved families of the place.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Ship' ^rd, founder of
the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teacher, and Matron,
together with accommodations for seventy-five young ladies. It is heated
by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished. It has re-
cently been enlarged by the addition of a substantial brick structure, sixty-five
by forty feet, containing a spacious Dining-Hall, also Kitchen and Laundry, be-
sides commodious rooms in the second story for students.
This hall is under the control of the Lady Principal and a senate of young
ladies elected b) the young ladies of the hall.
Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Piiilo Parsons, of Detroit, who gave
liberally for its erection in 1866. It contains the College Office, Art Rooms,
five Recitation Rooms, the Signal Service Station, and Dormitories for young
men; also the rooms of the Phi Alpha Pi Literary Society, and of the Young
Men's Christian Association.
This hall is under the control of one of the professors, who rooms in the
building, and a senate of young gentlemen elected by the young gentlemen of
the hall.
Mather Hall.
This new and commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000,
bears the name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Conn., who was its chief donor.
It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides two large Recitation Rooms, it
contains the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for Chemistry, Geology, and
Biology. It contains also the College Museum.


## p. 48 (#516) #############################################

52 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Gymnasium.
This building is a wooden structure, thirty-six by seventy-five feet, and
twenty-five feet post. It contains two Bowling Alleys, Dressing-Rooms, Bath-
Rooms, and Janitor's Room, on the first floor; and a spacious hall, the size
of the entire building, sixteen feet ceiling, on the second floor. The Gymnasium
is furnished with modern equipment throughout, the aim being to make it meet
as nearly as possible the demands of the institution. The immediate supervis-
ion rests with a Committee and a Director from the Faculty, while free instruc-
tion is given to all the students — to the ladies under the direction of Miss Hattie
McDougal; and to the gentlemen under Mr. Lyon, lately from the Gymnasium
of the Detroit Young Men's Christian Association. Classes in Dumb-bells,
Indian Clubs, Chest Weights, etc., are held daily at such hours as best to accom-
modate the students, all of whom are strongly urged to avail themselves of this
opportunity for physical culture. Care is taken that the exercise be adapted to
the individual wants of each student.
Conservatory Building.
This is a wooden structure purchased in connection with the property on
which the new Library building now stands, and has been entirely remodeled
and newly furnished during the past year. It contains a commodious hall for
the general exercises of the Conservatory, a large room for Vocal Instruction, a
room for Piano Practice, and Janitor's Room.
Preparatory Department.
It is the aim of this department in its Classical, Scientific and Literary
Courses, to fit students for entrance to any of the colleges in the country; while
in its English and Normal Courses it is designed to meet the needs of students
whose circumstances do not permit them to take a complete College Course,
yet who wish to make the most of opportunities within their reach to fit them-
selves for useful manhood and womanhood. To this end experienctd teachers
»nly are employed, each a specialist in his line. Students therefore receive
thorough training in foundation work in English, History, Mathematics, Natural
Sciences, and the Classics; and the stimulating effect of their association with
the students of older and higher classes is shown in the quality of the work done
in the class room.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and table board for young men and women can be had at the College
halls or in private families, as preferred. Young women proposing to live in
private families are expected to consult with the Principal before engaging their
boarding-places.

Adelphic Society Hall.
This building, which is the home of the Society whose name it bears, is one
of the most attractive structures on the College Campus. It is a gem of the
monumental style of architecture, built of field stone. It contains an Audito-
rium, Reception Rooms, and Cloak Rooms on the first floor; a Library, Com-
mittee Rooms, and Janitor's Room on the second floor.


## p. 51 (#519) #############################################


Phi Alpha Pi Halt
This building is the home of the Phi Alpha Pi Society. Its style of archi-
tecture is a combination of the Swiss and Greek. It is built of native field
stone laid in "Ashler" style, and elaborately trimmed with Lake Superior sand-
stone. The spacious portico in front is supported by columns of red granite,
and the roof and gables are of Spanish tile. The building contains an Audi-
torium, Reception Hall, Parlor, Library, and Cloak Rooms on the first floor;
Kitchen, Pantry, Committee Rooms, and Janitor's Rooms on the second floor.

In private families, table board and furnished rooms range in price from
$2.50 to $4.50 a week, fuel and lights included. Table board in Shipherd Hall
may be had at present for $2.00 a week. Room rent for unfurnished rooms in
Parsons Hall is from 19 to 58 cents a week for two students. Students who
are willing to live plainly reduce their expenses by boarding in clubs; the price
of club board has for the past three years ranged from $1.25 to $1.90 a week.
With the practice of economy in all expenditures, one hundred dollars, added to
the earnings of one or two hours' work a day, can be made to meet all necessary
expenses for a College year.
Board and Rooms in Shipherd Hall.
Board, with room furnished for two, from $3.00 to $350 for each student,
varying with location of room.
Board, with room furnished for one, from $350 to $3.75. These prices
include fuel and lights.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the bo.-ird as near cost as possible,
and these prices may vary as necessity requires.
The charge for washing is fifty cents a dozen. Those who do their own
washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents a term for the use of the
laundry. .
Every student furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips, her towels and
napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick boots, overshoes, and
water-proof cloak.
Expenses.
Tuition in all classes, from January 1, 1891, is $5.00 a term.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No deduction
will be made for absence, except in case of protracted sickness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music and
Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $5.00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Treasurer's
receipt for them is the student's warrant for entering classes.
By the formation of clubs the cost of board is reduced nearly one half.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.— To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred.

Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to remit
the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing for the
ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship and character
proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not extend to the incidental
charge, to room rent, or to the tuition in any study outside of the regular
course.

Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of Presbytery to the amount of $100 to $132 a year.
Members of the College classes whose necessities require it may be absent
two terms of their course for the purpose of teaching. They will be required
to pass examination in the studies pursued by their classes during their absence.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily need to have Collcge for lach of means.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,-
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find
employment for themselves about the College or in the village with satisfactory
compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies. A limited
number of the young ladies at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of their board by
assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the homes of the village.
A few students, by rigid economy and hard work, meet all their expenses from
their earnings while studying, but in such cases health and studies are likely to
suffer. No one should come, even for one term, without at least thirty or forty
dollars at his command for use if needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few
students, as provided for elsewhere, and the College has funds for otherwise
aiding to some extent certain classes of needy students. The great advantage
Olivet College offers students of this class, however, is the very low rate at
which all its facilities are furnished. The traditions of the College, and the
public sentiment of the students, favor economy in all expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
When a student occupying a room in College is to be absent from town
more than two weeks, he shall leave his key, with label attached, at the Secre-
tary's office, under penalty of forfeiting his room.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be retained unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required exercise.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.

OLIVET COLLEGE.
The constitution, by-laws, and usages of all societies of undergraduates shall
be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Girls and boys under fifteen years of age will not be received unless by
special arrangement.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the line
of the Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway, and between Battle Creek and
Charlotte.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversified
surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at once
attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beautiful, and
the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was founded by
earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their own culture, char.
acter, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility between town and College
are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmosphere of the place is free from
those things which divert or hinder the special work of the student, and most
favorable to quiet, earnest, successful study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of
total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.
For CATALOGUES and other information, address President H. Q. Butter-
field, Miss Mattie R. Ray, Principal Hamilton King, or Edgar I. Thompson,
Secretary of the College.

ART DEPARTMENT.
It is the object of this department to develop in the student's mind a
correct idea of form, as well as an appreciation of the beautiful; also to train
the powers of observation until the students are capable of working independ-
ently from life and sketching from nature.
A thorough understanding of the principles of drawing is followed by the
study of form from simple models and casts, afterwards studies in still life,
sketching from nature, and the study of the human form. The following will
give an idea of the work pursued:
Pencil Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four lessons.
This comprises the fundamental principles of drawing, working from the flat,
followed by the study of form or extension, from simple objects, models, and
casts.
Mechanical Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four
lessons.
Charcoal Drawing includes drawing from the cast and still life studies.
A good assortment of casts of leaves, fruit, fragments of the human form, etc.,
has been provided for this work.
Crayon Drawing — finished pictures and crayon portraits.
China Painting embraces the decorating of porcelain, vases, tiles, etc., in
mineral colors. Gilding is also done. A kiln is provided for the firing of
porcelain.

OLIVET COLLEGE. 61
OLIVET CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
INSTRUCTION.
This School of Music offers the finest advantages for the study of Music —
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical — either exclusively or with other studies.
The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Conservatories in
this country and Europe. The courses of study are comprehensive and thorough,
being arranged with a view to maintain a high standard of musical taste. The
aim of the management is to secure a complete mastery of all branches which
are undertaken by the student, rather than to give a superficial knowledge of a
few pieces. A real education of the musical faculties is accomplished, rather
than a training in styles which are to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
Four courses of study are offered:
i. A course in Piano, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
2. A course in Pipe Organ, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
3. A course in Vocal Music, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
4. A course combining work belonging to the three preceding courses.
A full course will take between four and five years. Talented students, with
diligence, may finish it in four years.
Being connected with the College, a double advantage is given the student
for musical and mental improvement, and it is the aim of the management to
encourage and urge the musical student to such studies as English Literature,
Rhetoric, Modern Languages, and History.
Who May Enter.
Students may enter without taking either of the Regular Courses, and may
pursue such a line of work and to such an extent as the teacher may direct.
Students who wish to enter any of the Regular Courses should have finished
the studies preparing for the Scientific and Literary Course of the College
(see page 37).
The Pianoforte.
In the study of this instrument great attention is given to every detail of
technique. Especial care is taken to develop a true musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.

The Pipe Organ.
Students desiring to study the Pipe Organ should have finished at least the
third grade of Piano Playing (see page 62).
A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter octaves
of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to be obtained,
at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ Playing, particu-
lar attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing, Registration, Church
Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Concert Music, with special
attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn. Pupils, when advanced, are
afforded practical experience in accompanying the Choir in Chorus and Quartette

Cultivation of the Voice.
The aim of this Department is to acquire a mastery over the production and
management of sound in singing.
Especial attention is given to a healthy and skillful management of the
breath; the production of a clear, full, and resonant tone, free from the throat;
distinct enunciation, the art of phrasing correctly, and the development of a
refined musical taste.
Course of Instruction.
Grade I: Lessons in Breathing. Emission of Voice in Tone Production.
Blending of Registers. Intervals. Trill and Diatonic Scale in slow move-
ment. Easy Studies and Solfeggios. Easy Songs and Ballads. Sight
Reading.

cises and Solfeggios. Phrasing, Songs from German, French, and Italian

Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental Music.
A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon its presenta-
tion. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in subsequent study,
a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight. The course of study
requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmon)'," Richter's
"Harmony," Richter's "Treatise on Counterpoint," and Stainer's "Compo-
sition."

mental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as they
afford an opportunity of playing before others.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.
The Normal and College singing classes meet twice a week, and are free to all
students. The Musical Guild, a society formed of, and managed by, students
of the Conservatory, meets every Monday. Its programmes consist of Instru-
mental and Vocal Selections, Essays, and Criticism on Music.
Rules for Practice.
No pupil can lake less than one hour a day, and two hours are little enough
for solid and satisfactory advancement.
Pupils are not expected to practice anything during practice hours excepting
their assigned worh.
Pupils cannot omit practice without an excuse from the Director or Depart-
ment Officer.
Miscellaneous Items.
Besides the Music Rooms in the Conservatory Building, the Conservatory
has the use of the College Church for the Pipe Organ, the College Church and
five rooms in the College buildings for piano practice, and the private rooms of
the Director.
Names must be registered and tuition paid before lessons are assigned.
Pupils are not received for a shorter period than one term.
Pupils must furnish or hire suitable instruments for practice. Instruments
can be hired at the College buildings and in the village.
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of protracted
sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the pupil.
Before a student can substitute Music for any study in the Literary Course,
he must have passed Grade II in Piano or Vocal work, or Grade I in the study
of the Pipe Organ; must have pursued the study of Theory for three terms; and
is required to devote at least two hours a day to the study of the Piano, Organ,
or Vocal Music.

Pupils in the Conservatory are subject to the regulations of the College.
Diplomas are awarded to those who complete the course and attain the
standard for graduation, on recommendation of the College Faculty.
In some cases members of the Conservatory have been able to pay a part
of their expenses by suitable employment. Such aid will be furnished as far as
possible to any who may need it. All persons desiring musical instruction
are encouraged and assisted in every possible way.
In every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be cheerfully
recommended for positions as teachers and organists.

SHORT COLLEGE COURSE.
In order to meet the necessities of a goodly number of students whose
circumstances do not at present warrant their undertaking a full college
course, a short elective course has been provided which may be completed
in two years.
For this course the same degree of preparation is required as for the
other college courses, and candidates for admission to the first year will be
examined, as they may elect, on the requirements for admission to the
Freshman class in either the Classical, Literary or Scientific courses.
All the studies of the college courses are open to the students of the short
course. Yet no student shall be allowed to elect a study which his previous
preparation does not fit him to pursue with advantage. All students in this
course are recommended to elect their studies in groups or certain definite
lines of work so that the best results may be attained.
On the completion of this course a certificate will be given showing the
amount and kind of work that has been done.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
BIBLE STUDY.
The importance of a systematic and careful study of the Bible as the
prime factor in a Christian education has led the College to the adoption of a
well defined course which covers seven years. The first three years are
outlined in the work of the Preparatory Department. The course of study
in the College is as follows:
Freshman Year : The life of Christ as set forth in the gospels.
Sophomore Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and
Christian Church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Junior Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Senior Year: Doctrines and accompanying duties as set forth in the
Old Testament and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
These exercises are held every Friday and all students are required to
attend.
PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY.
The course in Mental Philosophy begins with the Senior year and covers
twenty weeks, or a term and a half. The text-book used is Ex-President
Porter's, "The Elements of Intellectual Science." The material there
afforded is ample for the time alloted. The method of instruction is by
recitations, reviews, "quizes, " and final examinations through written and
oral questions. The rival theories which the text touches are discussed as
time allows. The object in view is practical rather than scholastic. It is
to make this Science '' justify" the principles of all the sciences and thus
show itself to be "the prime philosophy."
The course in Moral Philosophy covers the last half of the Winter
term. The textbook used is Ex-President Hopkins's, "The Law of Love


## p. 39 (#583) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 39
and Love as Law." From time to time reference is made to his "Outline
Study of Man." The method of instruction is similar to that employed in
Mental Philosophy. But a thesis upon some point connected with the
science may take the place of the final examination.
The course in Political Economy covers the Spring term of eleven weeks.
The text-book is Walker's "Political Economy," abridged from the third
edition of his " Manual of Political Economy." The method of instruction
is by recitations and constant reviews. Instead of a final examination every
student is assigned a thesis upon some such practical themes as Money, the
Relations of Capital and Labor, Free Trade, Protection, and the like. The
term closes with a few lectures.
In the study of Civil Liberty the following order of topics is observed:
Nature of personal and civil liberty.
Ancient, mediaeval and modern Anglican and American liberty.
Guarantees and checks.
Growth of liberty, and nature of Institutional Government.
Lieber's text-book is used and the recitation is varied, with familiar
lectures and discussions.
LANGUAGE
GREEK.
The aim of this department is to give the student a knowledge of the
Greek language and through it an acquaintance with the literature and life
of the people.
First in order therefore is a careful examination of the structure and
idioms of the language. This is sought by the reading and study of the
great masterpieces of this wonderful people in their various forms of litera-
ture. These are taken up somewhat in their order of development. This
also gives essentially the historic growth of the language and its people.
Thus Homer is studied for its two fold charm as the earliest of
epics and as a vivid picture of the prehistoric life of the Greeks.
Herodotus follows with his graphic views of the world of his day.
Thucydides depicts the golden age of Athens. Xenophon and Plato intro-
duce us to Socrates and the philosophy of that period. Aeschylus and
.Sophocles present us their masterpieces in the drama and Demosthenes the
consummate art and eloquence of'the Attic orators. The Hellenistic Greek
is also touched by a few lessons in the New Testament.
The aim is to give the student a love for Greek literature and art, and
the breadth of culture which comes by familiarity with the greatest thinkers
and writers of antiquity.

40 OLIVET COLLEGE.
LATIN.
The first part of the course in Latin aims chiefly to ground the student
thoroughly in the elements and structure of the language, though even here
sight is not lost of the pleasure and culture to be gained from consideration
of the subject-matter of works read; the last three, and more especially the
last two, years are devoted chiefly to acquainting the student with what is,
for purposes of general culture, best in the Latin language. Therefore
constant grammatical drill on a limited amount of text characterizes the
first stages of the course, while freedom from the necessity of considering
elementary matters leaves the student opportunity in the later years for
more rapid reading and a more serious investigation of the literature, history,
manners and customs, and other matters touching the life of the Romans.
Prose composition is continued throughout the Freshman year; reading
at sight, throughout the course.
For one day of each week after the Freshman year, students are given
independent work—i. e. work on which they do not have formal recitation
but merely examination at the close of the term—and the recitation hour
thus gained is spent in reading at sight the easier works of Latin literature.
Along with text work goes consideration of related subjects:
With Livy go the historical study of the times of the Punic wars and a
study of Roman military history; with Ovid goes mythology; with Horace,
Roman antiquities; with Tacitus, classical geography; with Terence, the
Roman drama; with Juvenal, a general view of Roman literature; with
Pliny, Martialis and Aulus Gellius, an inquiry into the history and private
life of the Romans under the empire.
Juniors and Seniors work together, the work being changed from year
to year.
Throughout the course instruction is given in part by lectures.
Latin is pronounced according to the Roman method.
FRENCH AND GERMAN.
Two years work of five recitations weekly is required in the Scientific
and Literary courses. A third year is optionaI. Classical students may
elect work for two years. No work of less than one year is counted toward
graduation.
The aim of the instruction is to give a fluency of reading, enabling the
student to master with comparative ease the modern writers; a speaking
knowledge ; and an acquaintance with the literature, as far as the limita-
tions of time and the necessary drill in theory permit. No place is given to
that superficial system, resulting in a mere smattering of French phrases
and German idioms at the sacrifice of the real grasp of the subject.
Thoroughness of the work, the training of the powers of thought as well

as of memory, are as requisite in this branch of education as in any other.
A careful knowledge of grammatical principles, and correctness of pronoun-
ciation are made the foundation for future work. Prose composition is con-
tinued during the entire course, special attention being given to the complex
nature of the German sentence. Conversation classes are formed under
suitable conditions. Simple prose reading is first taken up, followed by
more complicated style. The works read vary from year to year, but the
best authors, both classical and modern are studied; the beauties of style,
the spirit of the language, and the idiomatic expressions are pointed out.
Special emphasis is given to etymology and the laws of derivation; the
relations of French to Latin, and German to English are shown; and con-
stant reference is made to the historical growth and development of the
languages, and the intimate connection of literature and history.
The third year is more of the nature of seminary work. Carefully
directed original investigation is required, certain periods of literature are
studied, authors critically read and their works analyzed. Lectures are
given from time to time in connection with classroom work.
ENGLISH LITERATURE.
In this department the aim is to familiarize the student with the most
important facts in the history of our Literature, also to throw light on the
great names of the authors, both British and American, connected with its
development.
The course will extend through four terms.
Spring Term: The history of English and American Literature.
Fall Term: The study of the masterpieces of Chaucer and Spenser and
their cotemporaries.
Winter Term: The rise of Dramatic Literature, and the study of
Shakespeare, Bacon and Milton.
Spring Term: A general survey of American literature and study of
Hawthorne, Bryant, Longfellow, Lowell and Whittier. Library work on
assigned themes in English Literature.
LOGIC.
The following is an outline of the work:
Inductive and Deductive.
The fundamental laws of thought explained.
The syllogism, with copious illustrations.
The modes, figures, and their uses.
Discussion of fallacies.

HISTORY
The work in Ancient History consists of an investigation of the earliest
civilizations with the development of these nations in language, religion, art,
architecture, science, and civil polity. A term is devoted to the nations of
antiquity, including the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, Babylon-
ians, Persians, Hindoos, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. The
work is done topically, this method being rendered possible by the standard
histories and works of reference in the college library.
A term is devoted to English History and another term to French and
German History. In the Modern History an important feature is the
development of constitutional law and liberty.
MATHEMATICS
All students in the regular courses complete the work in Algebra, Geom-
etry and Trigonometry. Analytic Geometry is required in the Scientific
course. Surveying and Calculus are elective studies.
While the instruction in these various studies is designed to afford the
necessary basis for further work in pure and applied mathematics, the chief
aim is to promote habits of exact, logical reasoning and to stimulate origi-
nality and independence of thought Special effort is made to develop
ability in mathematical analysis. To insure a thorough mastery of a subject
written reviews are held at frequent intervals. The problems assigned at
recitations are drawn largely from outside the text-book. From this work
the student acquires a keen and quick perception of principles, and accuracy
and readiness in their application
In Surveying special prominence is given to field work. The student
becomes familiar with the use and adjustment of the instruments, and with
the methods employed in practical surveying. The work includes the cal-
culation of areas, chaining, triangulation, leveling, plotting, establishing
grades, dividing land and topographical surveying. The opportunity is
offered in this department to take up more extended work in civil engineer-
ing, comprising railway location and construction, mechanics, hydromechan-
ics and hydraulic engineering.

SCIENCE.
CHEMISTRY.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-four students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances,
and other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
Scientific students begin this study in the Fall term of Freshman year
and continue it for one year. Classical and Literary students may elect it
in Junior year. General chemistry is first considered and studied by aid of
text-book, lectures and laboratory practice
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed
to aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science.
The students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do. see, and
learn, and report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues
through the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and labora-
tory work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative or organic, may make
special arrangements for this purpose
BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY.
In Biology the following courses are offered:
I. General Morphology of Invertebrates; Laboratory work with lectures,
ten hours per week, first term, and first half of second term
II. General Morphology of Vertebrates. Continuation of course I. Ten
hours second half second term, and eight hours, third term.
III. Elements of Vertebrate Histology and Embryology. Laboratory work,
with lectures, two hours, third term. To be taken with II.
IV. Advanced work by special arrangement, throughout the year, ten
hours.
V. Structural Botany. Cryptogams. Laboratory work, with lectures, ten
hours, second term.
VI. Structural Botany. Vascular Cryptogams, and Phaenogams. Con-
tinuation of course V, eight hours, third term.
VII. Physiological Botany. Lectures and laboratory work, two hours,
third term. To be taken with VI.


## p. 44 (#588) #############################################

44 OLIVET COLLEGE
Course IV must be preceded by courses I, II and III. The nature and
extent of the work will be determined by consultation.
The Laboratory is fully equipped with apparatus and material, and is in
direct communication with the Museum, so that constant reference may be
made to its collections. During the past year extensive additions have been
made to the equipment, so that the Laboratory now possesses twenty-six
compound, and twenty-four dissecting microscopes of the make of Zeiss,
Leitz and Zentmayer; Thoma and Minot microtomes, and a full line of
first-class accessories The standard reference works and journals are pro-
vided for the students' use in the Laboratory. For those who wish to carry
their work farther than given in the above courses, special arrangements
will be made.
In Geology, at present, but one course is offered, consisting of recita-
tions, lectures, and field work. The large mineralogical and paleontological
collections of the Museum, casts, photographs, models, maps, etc., are daily-
used.
Two Journal Clubs are maintained, one in Biology, the other in Geology,
for the discussion of current literature, and the encouragement of original
investigation.
HUMAN ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authority, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the structure
and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is of
great importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the curricu-
lum of study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts,
models, and dissections. The laboratory is furnished with a series of the
Auzoux models, consisting of a manikin, and enlarged models of the eye, ear,
brain, cerebellum and cord, larynx, etc. The work continues two terms.
PHYSICS.
Four terms are given to the study of Physics, one in the Preparatory
course and three in the College. Fifteen hundred dollars have been expend-
ed this year in the purchase of additional apparatus, and hereafter labora-
tory practice will be a prominent feature of the work. The apparatus is not
for mere illustration, but for discovering and verifying laws and principles.
The collection includes an Atwood's machine of the best German make,
siren and sonometer made by Koenig, photometer, Norremberg's polariscope
and Browning's spectroscope, electrical generators, motors and test instru-
ments. To insure a symmetrical development of the subject, the didactic
method of instruction is used in connection with laboratory work. Thus


## p. 45 (#589) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 46
the student acquires not merely empiric skill but a knowledge of the achieve-
ments of others and the mathematical formulation of the laws discovered.
In the work in Astronomy the students have the use of a sextant and a
small telescope. \
METEOROLOGY.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have
ample opportunity to do special work in this practical science.
PHYSICAL EXERCISE.
Inasmuch as good health is essential to successful study special promi-
nence is given to Physical Culture. Systematic and regular exercise is
therefore required. For this purpose a convenient and commodious gym-
nasium has been provided. This building is a two story wooden structure,
thirty-six by seventy-five feet. It contains bowling alleys, dressing-rooms,
bath-rooms, and janitor's room, on the first floor; and a spacious hall on the
second floor, sixteen feet in height, and the size of the entire building. The
Gymnasium is furnished with modern equipment throughout, the aim being
to make it meet as nearly as possible the demands of the institution. The
immediate supervision rests with a Committee and a Director from the
Faculty, and free instruction is given to all the students—to the ladies
under the direction of Miss Hattie McDougal; and to the gentlemen under
Mr. Lyon, lately from the Gymnasium of the Detroit Young Men's Christian
Association. Classes in dumb-bells, Indian clubs, chest weights, etc.,
are held daily at such hours as best to accommodate the students. Care is
taken that the exercise be adapted to the individual wants of each student,
and is required of all except members of the Senior class.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
ENGLISH.
GRAMMAR.
Candidates for admission to the Junior Year must have sufficient knowl-
edge of English Grammar to complete the study in one term.
The work in English Analysis is a thorough study of the structure of the
sentence and the grammar of its parts. Some poem as Snow Bound, Enoch
Arden or Lady of the Lake is analyzed by the class. Special attention is
given to moods, infinitives, participles and idioms.
RHETORIC.
The Rhetoric of the Senior Year is a study of the elements of effective
discourse. The aim is not to discuss theories but to apply principles.
Daily practice is the law of the class.
RHETORIC ALS.
One hour each week throughout the entire preparatory course is given to
English work, embracing Composition, Elocution and the study of English
classics.
I, II, III.
Composition in the Junior Year aims to teach the student to express his
thoughts clearly and correctly.
Attention is given to building and recasting sentences, outlining themes,
and word study. Weekly exercises are written by the students and corrected
by the teacher.


## p. 52 (#596) #############################################

52 OLIVET COLLEGE.
IV, V, VI.
Elocution is the special English work for the Middle Year.
The essentials of the science, including Form, Tone, Pitch, Movement,
etc., are taught, and weekly rehearsals with the teacher required.
VII, VIII, IX.
In the Senior Year students prepare discussions and orations which are
given before the rhetorical divisions.
In addition to the work outlined, each term some English classic is read
by the class.
The study in English classics for the current year embraces the following:
Junior Year: Longfellow's Courtship of Miles Standish, Scott's Mar-
mion, Irving's Sketch Book.
Middle Year: Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, Scott's Ivanhoe,
Emerson's American Scholar.
Senior Year: Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and As You Like It, the Sir
Roger de Coverley Papers in the Spectator, Hawthorne's House of Seven
Gables.
Essays are written on topics connected with the reading.
THE ANCIENT CLASSICS.
The aim of the preparatory work in Latin and Greek is to lay the foun-
dation for higher scholarship.
Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin Grammar and Composi-
tion, Greek Grammar and Composition, and Roman and Greek History.
Past experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his
attainments in these subjects.
General information must not be regarded as an equivalent for technical
scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms and
usages of language.
LATIN.
To enter the Latin of the Junior Year a student must have a good work-
ing knowledge of the English Grammar. A knowledge of the elements of
the Latin language is found to be of great advantage.
I. Text: Easy Latin Lessons. Lindsay and Rollins. Grammar Work:

inflection of nouns, adjectives, and verbs in indicative mood both voices.
Points emphasized: vocabularies, case endings, verbal signs, writing and
speaking Latin, learning to read at sight.
II. Text: Easy Selections. Caesar. Grammar work: adjectives,
classification, inflection, comparison, pronouns in full, the four conjugations
in full. Points emphasized: comparison of irregular adjectives, demon-
strative pronouns, formulae for principal parts of verbs together with ex-
planation of ■euphonic changes in perfect and perfect participle stems,
reading at sight from blackboard, and anticipatory parsing.
III. Text: Caesar. Harper and Tolman. Grammar work: memoriz-
ing the main rules for syntax of nouns. Points emphasized : translation
into idiomatic English, indirect discourse.
IV. Text: Selections. Caesar, Viri Illustres, Cicero. Grammar work:
careful review of all paradigms, mastering the syntax of cases, composition.
Collar. Points emphasized: construction, principal parts of verbs, outline
of syntax of cases.
V. Text: Cicero. Allen and Greenough. Grammar work: the sub-
junctive mood, composition. Points emphasized: uses of the subjunctive,
construction.
VI. Text: Cicero. Grammar work: remainder of syntax not previously
discussed. Points emphasized: reading at sight, review of grammar by
outlines.
VII. Text: VergiI. Allen and Greenough. Selected eclogues, Aeneid,
book I, principles of prosody, etymology.
VIII. Text: Vergil. Aeneid, books II and III. Mythology: introduc-
tion to subject, careful analysis of the leading characters of classic mythol-
ogy. Seemann. Etymology.
IX. Text: Vergil, books IV and VI, book V is read at sight, special
attention is given to book VI. A general review.
Remarks—
1. Instruction is based upon the inductive method. This presupposes
familiarity, on the part of beginners, with English grammar. Only those
who are well grounded in English can successfully enter upon and prosecute
the work required. Some knowledge of Latin also is of great advantage.
Quality, not quantity, is emphasized, especially during the first two years.
2. Harkness's grammar is used. For convenience of reference in the
classroom only text-books listed should be used in recitation.
GREEK.
I. King's Greek Lessons. Inflection of nouns, adjectives, pronouns and
regular verbs; careful analysis and study of all forms, meaning of tense and
case signs, and the principles of euphony and contraction involved. A

thorough drill is given in vocabularies and simple syntax, written translation
from English into Greek. All translation from Greek is at sight.
II. The inflection of the third declension, pronouns and the regular verb
completed, comparisons, drill in vocabularies and simple syntax, writing
Greek, reading at sight. Up to this point a lesson comprehends anything
previously considered by the class. Much attention is given to the group-
ing of words and to word building.
III. Goodwin's Grammar, Coy's Reader to p. 33, /u verbs studied, parts
of more common irregular verbs memorized, vocabularies, sight reading,
word building.
IV and V. During this term two hours a day are given to this study.
One hour is given up to rapid translation and sight reading, Coy's Reader,
Moss's Reader, and four books of Anabasis. The other hour is devoted to a
careful review of the conjugations and further study of irregular and //( verbs,
twenty lessons of Jones's Greek Prose, special attention to conditional sen-
tences and indirect discourse, a careful study of the syntax of the cases.
VI. One book of Homer, study of Homeric forms, scansion and atten-
tion to mythology, sight reading of easy prose.
VII. Books II and III of Homer, sight reading in Attic Prose and in
Homer.
HISTORY.
To enter the U. S. History class candidates must have an acquaintance
with the subject, as far as the Revolution. A large amount of reading and
investigation is required, the purpose being to cultivate a spirit of inquiry
and to teach the student the sources of authority.
Grecian History: the outlines from the earliest times to 146 B. C.
Roman History: the outlines from the earliest times to the empire.
In most preparatory schools Grecian and Roman history are taught in
connection with the Greek and Latin language.
The histories of these nations are of such importance to the student that
they are given independent places in the curriculum.
The method will be the same as in U. S. History.
SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT.
The Science of Government includes the study of the state and the
federal constitution and investigation of the principles that underlie repub-
lican institutions.

student is trained to read at sight by frequent opportunity after the end of
the first term.

EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS.
Library and Reading Room.
The College Library contains 19,000 volumes, and also a large collection
of pamphlets. Its books have been selected with care, and with reference
to the work of both professors and students. Hence its growth has been
healthful, and adapted to the wants of the College. In addition to other
sources of income, the interest of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually
devoted to the purchase of books. This endowment, $15,000, is the gift of
the late Mrs. Lucy E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Connecticut, as a memorial of
her gifted son, whose name it bears.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Dewey system.
A card catalogue, both of authors and sub cts, makes every book and its
contents easily accessible to every reader. Each student is allowed free
access to the shelves, also the privilege of drawing books from the Library.
The Library is open seven hours daily, except Sundays.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, supplied with one
hundred and forty periodicals and leading journals of news, politics,
religion, science, literature, and art. These may be consulted, but cannot
be withdrawn from the Library.
The new Library building, Burrage Hall, takes its name from the late
Leonard Burrage, of Leominster, Massachusetts, The building is of the
Romanesque style of architecture, 110 feet in length by 52 feet in breadth,
and has a capacity for about 100,000 volumes. The substructure is of field-
stone-granite boulders-massive and solid; the superstructure, of lonia
sandstone, warmer in color, and more susceptible to the touches of art.
The interior is finished in natural oak, and the walls simply decorated in
warm Tuscan colors. The first floor contains the Delivery Room, Libra-
rian's Office, two Cloak Rooms, Reading Room, and Stack Room. Above
is a Mezzanine Room for cataloguing, a large Seminary Room, and a room
for Special Collections.
Burrage Hall is commodious, elegant, and complete in its appointments,
literally fire proof in the stack room, and practically so throughout. It
happily combines economy and convenience in its working arrangements,
security for the books, attractive, well-furnished and well-lighted rooms for
its readers, and the possibility of enlargement at moderate expense and

without change of the original plan. It thus affords a safe and permanent
repository for the Library, and invites all friends of the College to make
frequent and large additions to the present valuable collection. Gifts of
books, manuscripts, pamphlets, and periodicals are very acceptable Local
histories, anniversary addresses, the literature of institutions, and all docu-
ments relating to American life and history are especially desired.
Former students and all friends of the College can do much to assist the
librarian in this work. Correspondence is respectfully solicited. The cost
of transportation will be borne by the Library on such donations as can be
used.
Science Library.
An important step has been taken in laying the foundation of a much
needed reference library of scientific books, for the use of the science
departments. This is to be located permanently in Mather Hall.
The Museum of Natural History.
The second floor of Mather Hall is devoted to the College Museum and
the Biological Laboratory The former consists of a general zoological
collection, synoptically arranged, illustrating all forms of animal life; the
Brown Cabinet of Mineralogy and Conchology, containing over 20.000
specimens; the Botanical Museum, and the Palmer series of "Ward's
Reproductions."
During the past year among the most valuable additions to the Museum
have been a series of Ziegler's wax models illustrative of embryological sub-
jects, the large collection of Minerals and Palaeozoic fossils presented by Mr-
Allan Bourn, of New York City, and numerous smaller collections. The
whole Museum is arranged so as to be of the greatest practical value to the
students, and is for worh rather than for mere exhibition.
Mather Hall.
This commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000, bears the
name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Conn., who was its chief donor. It
is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides the College Museum it contains
two large Recitation Rooms, the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for
Chemistry, Geology, and Biology

Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who
gave liberally for its erection in 1866. It contains the College Office, Art
Rooms, five Recitation Rooms, the Signal Service Station, and Dormitories
for young men; also the rooms of the Young Men's Christian Association.
This hall is under the control of the College Secretary, who rooms in the
building, and a senate of young men elected by the occupants of the hall.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder
of the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Teacher Assistant, and
Matron, together with accommodations for seventy-five young women. It
is heated by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnish-
ed. The Annex, a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet, con-
tains a spacious Dining-Hall, also Kitchen and Laundry, besides commo-
dious rooms in the second story for students.
Views of some of these buildings and also of the Society Halls are
given in the frontispiece. The location of these buildings and of the
Conservatory, Church, Gymnasium, and President's House is shown on the
accompanying engraving of the Campus.

On reaching town for the first time, young men entering the College
classes may obtain any needed information from President H. Q. Butterfield;
young men in the Normal Department, from Prof. Joseph Estabrook; in
the Preparatory Department, from Principal Hamilton King; and young
women in any department, from the Principal of the Young Women's
Department, Miss Emily J. Clark. Correspondence may be addressed to
any of the above named persons, or to Albert L. Lee, Secretary of the

of learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
Students will be amenable to the regulations of the College from the
time of their arrival.
No one under fourteen years of age will be admitted to the institution
except by vote of the Faculty.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining
full membership. If during this period their scholarship, conduct, or
character is such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or unadvis-
able, they may be so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without
any further action, and whenever a student's influence is found to be bad,
the Faculty may separate him from the College without making formal
charges.
Any student in good standing, provided no unsettled accounts appear
against him, may, if he request it, receive an honorable dismission.
Entrance Examinations.
Entrance examinations will begin at 9 A. M., Wednesday, the day before

the opening of the term, and all new students are expected to reach town in
time for this work.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects
studied by the class to which the admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to any of the college classes, who are deficient
in three prescribed studies, may be received conditionally, provided such
conditions are removed before the end of the year.
Candidates from schools on the University list and from other schools
approved by the Faculty may be admitted to the Freshman year without
examination, provided they bring a certificate signed by the head of the
school, and showing a satisfactory standing in the studies therein pursued.
All others must sustain a creditable examination before assignment to
classes.
Rules for Classifying Students in this Catalogue.
i. Students may be admitted to the Freshman class, conditioned on
three terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be
advanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year in College the character of the majority of
the studies pursued during the year determines the class in which the
student shall be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted,
and the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given him, and may be given to his parent or
guardian. If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be
remanded to a lower class, or dismissed from the College.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of
each student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed
duties, is sent to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each
term. At the close of the College year all the classes are examined in the
presence of committees appointed annually by the Congregational Associa-
tion, and by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These exami-
nations are always public.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-

John H. Hewitt Scholarship Prize.
Prof. John H. Hewitt, of Williams College, and formerly a pro-
fessor in this College, has given $1,000 to establish a prize in memory
of his son, John Downing Hewitt. It is awarded, at the close of the second
year in College, to that student in the Classical Course who has been regular
in the course and has ranhed highest in the regular studies of the Freshman
and Sophomore years. This prize was awarded to Hattie Louise Warren,
Portland, in 1891.
Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from
the Classical Course, that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from
the Scientific Course, and that of Bachelor of Letters upon the graduates
from the Literary Course.
Certificates are given to the graduates from the Normal Department and
to those completing the Short College Course.
After June, 1894, the Master's degree will be conferred in accordance
with the following provisions:
Any candidate who has taken the Bachelor's degree in Olivet College, or
in any other institution requiring an equivalent amount of work for that de-
gree, may be recommended for the corresponding Master's degree, provided
that for a period of one year of residence or two years of non-residence, he
pursue a course of advanced, non-professional study, pass examination and
present a satisfactory thesis.

Three members of the Faculty, one of them an instructor to whose depart-
ment the studies pursued by the candidate especially belong, shall constitute
the Committee on Degrees. Special classes will not be organized, but post-
graduate work in any department may be done under the direction of the
professors, and all the facilities of the library and laboratories will be at the
service of the candidate, subject, however, to the regulations of the com-
mittee.
Candidates for the Master's Degree will please address either member of
the standing committee.

OLIVET COLLEGE.
Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies: the Soronian,
for young women, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic, for young men.
All the exercises are open to visitors, and a friendly rivalry and healthy en-
thusiasm make their weekly meetings both profitable to their members and
attractive to their friends. Their Annual Public Exercises are occasions of
great interest and of marked literary excellence. Two of the societies have
already adorned the campus with fine buildings, and plans for a third hall
are under consideration.
The Adelphic Hall is a gem of the monumental style of architecture,
built of field stone. It contains an Auditorium, Reception Rooms, and
Cloak Rooms on the first floor; a Library, Committee Rooms, and Janitor's
Room on the second floor.
The Phi Alpha Pi Hall in its style of architecture is a combination of
Swiss and Greek. It is built of native field stone laid in '' Ashler" style and
elaborately trimmed with Lake Superior sandstone. The spacious portico
in front is supported by columns of red granite, and the roof and gables are
of Spanish tile. The building contains an Auditorium, Reception Hall,
Parlor, Library, and Cloak Rooms on the first floor; Kitchen, Pantry, Com-
mittee Rooms, and Janitor's rooms on the second floor.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the Col-
lege Chapel, and public religious worship every Sabbath morning. Unless
special request is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all students
are required to attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday-schools in the
neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before these
societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by some
speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are conducted by
the students during the College year.
The Young Men's Christian Association occupies a commodious suite of
rooms in Parsons Hall. These are neatly furnished and afford an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and add much to the
efficiency of the Christian work of the College.

70 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Young Women's Department.
All young women in the College are under the supervision of the Princi-
pal of this department, and the care of the Woman's Board.
It is desirable that all should be members of the family with the Principal
and Matron at Shipherd Hall. They are allowed, however, to secure rooms
and board with approved families of the place.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and board can be obtained either at the College or in private
families as preferred.
In Parsons Hall unfurnished rooms are rented to young men at from
ten to twenty-two dollars a year—or from thirteen to twenty-eight cents per
week, when two students occupy a room. Rooms in this building must be
secured from the College Secretary, and only quiet and studious young men
are admitted. Noisy or disorderly occupants may be removed at any time.
Rooms in Parsons Hall are rented only by the year, and no occupant is
allowed to board himself in this hall.
In Shipherd Hall young women may secure furnished rooms and board
at from $3.00 to $3.50 for each student, provided two occupy the same room.
Board, with room furnished for one, from $3.50 to $3.75 These prices
include fuel and lights.
Rooms in this hall can not be engaged for less than a term.
The charge for washing is fifty cents a do2en. Those who do their own
washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents for the use of the laun-
dry.
Every occupant of this hall furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips,
her towels and napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick boots■
overshoes and water-proof cloak.
Young men also may obtain table board at Shipherd Hall at $2.00 per
week.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the board as near cost as possible,
and these prices may vary as necessity requires.
In Private Families students may secure board and rooms subject to
the following regulations:
No student shall room or board in any place not approved by the Fac-
ulty; nor room in a house not otherwise occupied, except by special permis-
sion of the Faculty.


## p. 71 (#615) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 71
Young men and young women will neither board nor room at the same
place in the town.
Table board in families is from $2.00 to S2.50 per week.
Board and rooms from $2.50 to $4.50 per week, fuel and lights included.
Students who are willing to live plainly reduce their expenses by board-
ing in clubs; the price of club board has for the past three years ranged from
$1.25 to $1.90 a week.
Application for rooms and board may be made either in person or by let-
ter to the College Secretary.
Expenses.
Tuition in all classes is $s 00 a term.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No deduc-
tion will be made for absence, except in case of protracted sickness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music and
Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $5.00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Treasurer's
receipt for them must be presented to the Registrar before the student can
enter his classes.
Text-books are furnished by the College at actual cost.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.—To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred.

Beneficary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to
remit the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing
for the ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship
and character proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not
extend to the incidental charge, to room rent, or to the tuition in any study
outside of the regular course.
Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of Presbytery to the amount of $100 to Siyz a year.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily nerd to leave College for lafh of means.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find
employment for themselves about the College or in the village with satisfac-
tory compensation, for all the time they can spare, from their studies. A
limited number of the young women at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of
their board by assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the
homes of the village. A few students, by rigid economy and hard work,
meet all their expenses from their earnings while studying, but in such cases
health and studies are likely to suffer. No one should come, even for one

term, without at least thirty or forty dollars at his command for use if
needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few students, as provided for else-
where, and the College has funds for otherwise aiding to some extent certain
classes of needy students. The great advantage Olivet College offers
students of this class, however, is the very low rate at which all its facilities
are furnished. With the practice of economy in all expenditures, one
hundred dollars, added to the earnings of one or two hours' work a day, can
be made to meet all tucessttry expenses for a College year. The traditions
of the College, and the public sentiment of the students, favor economy in
all expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be reserved unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation ; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required
exercise.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution, by-laws, and usages of all societies of the students
shall be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the
line of the Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway, and between Lansing and
Battle Creek.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversi-
fied surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at
once attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as
beautiful, and the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College
was founded by earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both
their own culture, character, and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility
between town and College are unknown at Olivet. As a result, the atmos-
phere of the place is free from those things which divert or hinder the
special work of the student, and most favorable to quiet, earnest, successful
study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor
of total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.
For Catalogues and other information, address President H. Q.
Butterfield, or Albert L. Lee, Secretary of the College.

PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
This department is under the same general supervision as the other de-
partments, and under the immediate direction and management of the prin-
cipal. The members enjoy the same privileges and are subject to the same
regulations as the students in the College. Each group of subjects is taught
by a college graduate who is a specialist of experience and ability.
Terms of Admission.
To enter the Junior Year applicants must have pursued the English
Grammar through syntax, U. S. History through the Revolutionary Period,
the elements of Civil Government, Reading and Spelling, and must have
completed the study of Arithmetic, including the metric system. Any who
are not fully prepared to enter may take up these subjects in the Review
Class of the Normal Course, (see page 59), at the same time they are pursu-
ing regular work. Students who bring satisfactory certificates from any
school of good standing will not be examined in the branches to enter the
Junior Year, but each subsequent recitation will be regarded as an examina-
tion. A student will be dropped at any time from a class in which he
does not perform satisfactory work
Candidates for a higher standing will be examined in the studies pre-
viously passed by the class they wish to enter
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies
are accepted from several high schools of the state, of whose thoroughness
the Faculty have assured themselves, and from schools on the University
list.
The school is not a suitable one for students who are idle, wayward or
averse to study, or for such as require the supervision of a teacher, and the
routine of a school room to enforce industry and fidelity.
All students are expected to bring certificates of good character, and if

possible, satisfactory certificates of studies pursued elsewhere. No one
under fourteen years of age will be received.
The Principal may be found in the college office on Wednesday, the day
previous to the opening of each term, for consultation in reference to studies
and rooms. The regular work of the classes begins on Friday, hence it is
essential that students obtain their schedules of study and become settled in
their rooms on Thursday.
Classes and Courses.
The regular work is arranged in three classes, each covering one year.
It provides three courses—Classical, Scientific, and Literary. A gradu-
ate of the Classical course may enter the Classical course of Olivet College
without examination. This preparation will enable a student to enter any
other American college. A graduate of the Scientific course may enter the
Scientific course of Olivet College without examination. This preparation
will enable a student to enter the best Scientific schools in the country. A
graduate of the Literary course may enter the Literary course of Olivet
College or the Literary or Philosophical course of other colleges.
Besides the courses preparing for the regular college courses, this depart-
ment offers the Preparatory Course for the Short Course. This preparation
will enable a student to enter the Short Course of Olivet College. This
course is an attempt to meet the needs of the large number of young men
and young women who feel the need of a better preparation for life's work,
but do not feel that they can complete a full college course of study. To
all such a careful consideration of the characteristics of this course as set
forth on page 37 is commended. The work of the first three years of the
Normal course (p. 59) is done in this department.
Students are expected to have three hours of recitation each day, for five
days in the week, besides rhetoricals and physical exercise.
Diplomas are given to graduates from any of the above courses.
The work in general aims at two points—teaching and training.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-
atic prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed.
A variety of optional and extra studies is offered, especially in the Senior
Year, to meet the wants of students who are fitting for definite college re-
quirements, or are to enter advanced divisions in classics, mathematics,
natural sciences, or modern languages at the colleges; and also to provide
for ambitious students who may wish to broaden their preparation. It is
not practicable to show all the possible combinations in the " Courses of
Study" on pp 49-58.
All students of the department in their work, have access to the privileges
of the College Library and Museum and to the Physical, Chemical, and
Zoological Laboratories.

Reports And Deportment.
A report of each students deportment and proficiency in work is sent to
parents every term and will be furnished on request at any time
Students are not allowed to change their rooms except at the end of each
term, unless for reasons that cannot be foreseen. There is therefore, need
of care in selecting rooms when students enter.
One of the greatest obstacles to the intellectual progress and moral im-
provement of students is the excessive amount of money furnished them by
parents and guardians. It is advised that all money be placed in the bank
and that students be required to render an itemized account to the parent
every week of all money expended. Students are forbidden to contract any
debts, or to have any accounts, except for board. Any person opening such
accounts with students without conferring with the principal will do so at his
own rish.
For further information, address
Hamilton King,
Principal of Preparatory Department,
Olivet, Michigan.

ART DEPARTMENT.
It is the object of this department to develop in the student's mind a
correct idea of form, as well as an appreciation of the beautiful; also to
train the powers of observation until the students are capable of working
independently from life and sketching from nature.
A thorough understanding of the principles of drawing is followed by the
study of form from simple models and casts, afterwards studies in still life,
sketching from nature, and the study of the human form. The following
will give an idea of the work pursued:
Pencil Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four lessons.
This comprises the fundamental principles of drawing, working from the
flat, followed by the study of form or extension, from simple objects,
models, and casts.
Mechanical Drawing is free to all students for one term of twenty-four
lessons.
Charcoal Drawing includes drawing from the cast and still life studies.
A good assortment of casts of leaves, fruit, parts of the human form, etc.,
has been provided for this work.
Crayon Drawing—finished pictures and crayon portraits.
China Painting embraces the decorating of porcelain, vases, tiles, etc.,
in mineral colors. Gilding is also done. A kiln is provided for the firing
of porcelain.
Oil and Water Colors—studies in still life, landscapes, flowers, fig-
ures, etc.
Students wishing to make Art a specialty can have instruction and the
use of the Art Room and models, daily.
A term's work comprises twenty-four lessons, each two hours long.
Tuition must be paid in advance, and no deduction will be made for
absence from lessons except in case of sickness.
During Commencement week there is an exhibition of work done during
the year; hence it is necessary that the work be either left in the studio
until then, or sent back at that time.

OLIVET CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.
INSTRUCTION.
This School of Music offers the finest advantages for the study of Music—
Instrumental, Vocal, and Theoretical—either exclusively or with other
studies. The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Con-
servatories in this country and Europe. The courses of study are compre-
hensive and thorough, being arranged with a view to maintain a high stand-
ard of musical taste. The aim of the management is to secure a complete
mastery of all branches which are undertaken by the student, rather than
to give a superficial knowledge of a few pieces. A real education of the
musical faculties is accomplished, rather than a training in styles which are
to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
Four courses of study are offered:
1. A course in Piano, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
2. A course in Pipe Organ, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
3. A course in Vocal Music, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
4. A course combining work belonging to the three preceding courses.
A full course will take between four and five years. Talented students,
with diligence, may finish it in four years.
Being connected with the College, a double advantage is given the
student for musical and mental improvement, and it is the aim of the man-
agement to encourage and urge the musical student to such studies as
English Literature, Rhetoric, Modern Languages, and History.
Who May Enter.
Students may enter without taking either of the Regular Courses, and
may pursue such a line of work and to such an extent as the teacher may
direct. Students who wish to enter any of the Regular Courses should have
finished the studies preparing for the Scientific or Literary Course of the
College (see page 74).
The Pianoforte.
In the study of this instrument great attention is given to every detail of
technique. Especial care is taken to develop a true musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.
The following course is merely an outline, and will be varied by the
Director, to meet the needs of different pupils:

A very complete Pipe Organ of two manuals, and two and a quarter
octaves of pedals, furnishes an opportunity for practice such as is rarely to
be obtained, at any price, even in the largest cities. In the lessons in Organ
Playing, particular attention is given to the study of obligato pedal playing,
Registration, Church Service in all forms, Choir Accompaniment, and Con-
cert Music, and special attention to the works of Bach and Mendelssohn.
Pupils, when advanced, are afforded practical experience in accompanying
the Choir in Chorus and Quartette.

Cultivation of the Voice.
The aim of this Department is to acquire a mastery over the production
and management of sound in singing.
Especial attention is given to a healthy and skillful management of the
breath; the production of a clear, full, and resonant tone, free from the
throat; distinct enunciation, the art of phrasing correctly, and the develop-
ment of a refined musical taste.
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.
Grade I: Lessons in Breathing. Emission of Voice in Tone Production.
Blending of Registers. Intervals. Trill and Diatonic Scale in slow
movement. Easy Studies and Solfeggios. Easy Songs and Ballads.
Sight Reading.
Grade II: Study of Major and Minor Intervals with and without Porta-
mento. Arpeggios. Chromatic Scale in slow movement Major and
Minor Scales. Exercises, Legato, and Staccato. Progressive Studies
and Solfeggios. English Songs and Ballads. Sacred Music. Sight
Reading.

Writers. Sacred Music. Sight Reading.
Grade IV: Continuation of Scale Study. Embellishments. Advanced
Exercises and Solfeggios. Phrasing, Songs from German, French, and
Italian Composers. Difficult Songs from Classic Writers. Selections
from Oratorios. Sight Reading.
Theory of Music and Composition.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
•f it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental
Music. A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon
its presentation. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in
subsequent study, a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight.
The course of study requires three years.
The text-books used are Emery's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Harmony," Goetschiu's " Harmony and Composition," Richter's "Trea-
tise on Counterpoint," and Stainer's "Composition."

By the payment of the Conservatory tuition and incidental fee ($2 50),
pupils may take studies in the College without extra charge.
Examinations.
Upon entering the Conservatory, students will be examined in the various
branches to be studied. To facilitate examination, each pupil should be

ed with many of the finest works of musical art. The Exhibition Concerts
occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the progress
and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a high order, and have received
great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals take
place every Monday evening, at which time pupils perform vocal and instru-
mental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as they
afford an opportunity of playing before others.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.
The Normal and College singing classes meet twice a week, and are free to
all students. The Musical Guild, a society formed of, and managed by,
students of the Conservatory, meets every Monday. Its programmes consist
of Instrumental and Vocal Selections, Essays, and Criticism on Music.
Rules for Practice.
No pupil can take less than one hour a day, and two hours are little enough
for solid and satisfactory advancement.
Pupils are not expected to practice anything during practice hours excepting
their assigned work.
Pupils can not omit practice without an excuse from the Director or
from their teacher.
Day Pupils.
To meet the growing demand for Musical instruction on the part of resi-
dents of Olivet and vicinity who have no time or desire to take studies in
the College, the following arrangement has been made by the Conservatory:
Day pupils may be received from their homes who shall simply report to
their teacher for instruction at appointed hours and shall be exempt from all
connection with the College and also exempt from the incidental fee of the
Conservatory.
Tuition for Elementary work:
For eleven lessons of a half hour each S6.00
For twenty-two lessons of a half hour each ti.oo
For eleven lessons of an hour each 10.00
For Advanced work, tuition the same as for regular Conservatory students
with the exception of the Incidental fee
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of pro-
tracted sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with
the pupil.
Miscellaneous Items.
Besides the Music Rooms in the Conservatory Building, the Conservatory
has the use of the College Church for the Pipe Organ, the College Church


## p. 89 (#633) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
and five rooms in the College buildings for piano practice, and the private
rooms of the Director.
Names must be registered and tuition paid before lessons are assigned.
Pupils are not received for a shorter period than one term.
Pupils must furnish or hire suitable instruments for practice. Instru-
ments can be hired at the College buildings and in the village.
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of pro-
tracted sickness, when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the
pupil.
Before a student can substitute Music for any study in the Literary
Course, he must have passed Grade II in Piano or Vocal work, or Grade I
in the study of the Pipe Organ; must have pursued the study of Theory for
three terms; and is required to devote at least two hours a day to the study
of the Piano, Organ, or Vocal Music.
Terms in the Conservatory commence with those in the College.
Pupils in the Conservatory are subject to the regulations of the College.
Diplomas are awarded to those who complete the course and attain the
standard for graduation, on recommendation of the College Faculty.
In some cases members of the Conservatory have been able to pay a part
of their expenses by suitable employment. Such aid will be furnished as
far as possible to any who may need it. All persons desiring musical in-
struction are encouraged and assisted in every possible way.
In every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be cheer-
fully recommended for positions as teachers and organists

CONTRIBUTIONS.
By vote of the Board of Trustees of the College at their annual session
in June, 1870, the Treasurer is directed to publish annually in the Catalogue
a full statement of all contributions to the College, and the names and res-
idences of the contributors. But donations to the College in the form of
real estate or personal notes are not included in this list until they are con-
verted into cash.
The subjoined is such a statement, for the year ending November 1,
1891, but does not include payments of interest. This statement is designed
to be fully correct and particular. Should, however, any person discover
any omission or error in this record of benevolences to the College, he will
confer a great favor by promptly pointing out the same to the Treasurer or
President of the College.

Olivet College owes its existence and prosperity to the generosity of the
friends of Christian Education. It believes that the number of those who
purpose to give to meet its necessities is ever increasing. It is far better
for these to carry out their intention while living, as then they are sure
that their gifts reach their destination. It is also desirable that donations
be for general purposes. In bequests the corporate name of the College
must be used. The following form is commended:
I give and bequeath to Olivet College, located at Olivet, Eaton County,
Michigan, the sum of t , to be used in such manner as the Trustees
shall deem most useful to the College.
Those making specific bequests may vary the above form by inserting the
special object desired. To ascertain the more pressing needs of the College
correspondence with the President is invited.

circumstances do not at present warrant their undertaking a full college
course, a short elective course has been provided which may be completed
in two years.
For this course the same degree of preparation is required as for the
other college courses, and candidates for admission to the first year will be
examined, as they may elect, on the requirements for admission to the
Freshman class in either the Classical, Literary or Scientific courses.
All the studies of the college courses are open to the students of the short
course. Yet no student shall be allowed to elect a study which his previous
preparation does not fit him to pursue with advantage. All students in this
course are recommended to elect their studies in groups or certain definite
lines of work so that the best results may be attained.
On the completion of this course a certificate will be given showing the
amount and kind of work that has been done.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
BIBLE STUDY.
The importance of a systematic and careful study of the Bible as the
prime factor in a Christian education has led the College to the adoption of a
well defined course which covers seven years. The first three years are
outlined in the work of the Preparatory Department. The course of study
in the College is as follows:
Freshman Year: The life of Christ as set forth in the gospels.
Sophomore Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and
Christian Church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Junior Year: Internal and external evidences of Christianity.
Senior Year: Doctrines and accompanying duties as set forth in the
Old Testament and Pauline Epistles. The Shorter Catechism.
These exercises are held every Friday and all students are required to
attend.
PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY.
The course in Mental Philosophy begins with the Senior year and covers
twenty weeks, or a term and a half. The text-book used is Ex-President
Porter's, "The Elements of Intellectual Science." The material there
afforded is ample for the time allotted The method of instruction is by
recitations, reviews, "quizzes," and final examinations through written and
oral questions. The rival theories which the text touches are discussed as
time allows. The object in view is practical rather than scholastic. It is
to make this science "justify" the principles of all the sciences and thus
show itself to be "the prime philosophy."
The course in Moral Philosophy covers the last half of the Winter
term. The text-book used is Ex-President Hopkins's, "The Law of Love.


## p. 33 (#681) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. S3
and Love as a Law." From time to time reference is made to his "Outline
Study of Man." The method of instruction is similar to that employed in
Mental Philosophy. But a thesis upon some point connected with the
science may take the place of the final examination.
The course in Political Economy covers the Spring term of eleven weeks.
The text-book is Walker's "Political Economy," abridged from the third
edition of his "Manual of Political Economy." The method of instruction
is by recitations and constant reviews. Instead of a final examination
every student is assigned a thesis upon some such practical themes as Money,
the Relations of Capital and Labor, Free Trade, Protection, and the like.
The term closes with a few lectures.
In the study of Civil Liberty the following order of topics is observed:
Nature of personal civil liberty.
Ancient, mediaeval and Anglican and American liberty.
Guarantees and checks.
Growth of liberty, and nature of Institutional Government.
Lieber's text-book is used and the recitation is varied, with familiar
lectures and discussions.
LANGUAGE.
GREEK.
The aim of this department is to give the student a knowledge of the
Greek language and through it an acquaintance with the literature and life
of the people.
First in order therefore is a careful examination of the structure and
idioms of the language. This is sought by the reading and study of the
great masterpieces of this wonderful people in their various forms of litera-
ture. These are taken up somewhat in their order of development. This
also gives essentially the historic growth of the language and its people.
Thus Homer is studied for its twofold charm as the earliest of epics and
as a vivid picture of the prehistoric life of the Greeks. Herodotus follows
with his graphic views of the world of his day. Thucydides depicts
the golden age of Athens. Xenophon and Plato introduce us to Socrates
and the philosophy of that period. ASschylus and Sophocles present us
their masterpieces in the drama, and Demosthenes the consummate art and
eloquence of the Attic orators. The Hellenistic Greek is also touched by a
few lessons in the New Testament.
The aim is to give the student a love for Greek-'literature and art, and
the breadth of culture which comes by familiarity with the greatest thinkers
and writers of antiquity.

OLIVET COLLEGE.
LATIN.
The first part of the course in Latin aims chiefly to ground the student
thoroughly in the elements and structure of the language, though even here
sight is not lost of the pleasure and culture to be gained from consideration
of the subject matter of works read; the last three, and more especially the
last two years are devoted chiefly to acquainting the student with what is,
for purposes of general culture, best in the Latin language. Therefore
constant grammatical drill on a limited amount of text characterizes the
first stages of the course, while freedom from the necessity of considering
elementary matters leaves the student opportunity in the later years for
more rapid reading and a more serious investigation of the literature, history,
manners and customs, and other matters touching the life of the Romans,
Prose composition is continued throughout the Freshman year; reading
at sight, throughout the course.
For one day of each week after the Freshman year, students are given
independent work-i. e. work on which they do not have formal recitation,
but merely examination at the close of the term and the recitation hour
thus gained is spent in reading at sight the easier works of Latin literature.
Along with text work goes consideration of related subjects:
With Livy go the historical study of the times of the Punic wars and a
study of Roman military history; with Ovid goes mythology; with Horace,
Roman antiquities; with Tacitus, classical geography; with Terence, the
Roman drama; with Juvenal, a general view of Roman literature ; with
Pliny, Martialis and Aulus Gellius, an inquiry into the history and private
life of the Romans under the empire.
Juniors and Seniors work together, the work being changed, if necessary
from year to year.
Throughout the course instruction is given in part by lectures.
Latin is pronounced according to the Roman method.
FRENCH AND GERMAN.
Two years' work of five recitations weekly is required in the Scientific
and Literary courses. A third year is optional Scientific and Literary
students after completing two years' work in either French or German, may
elect for a third year's study the work of the first year in French or German.
Literary students, wishing to continue the study of French or German a
third year, may do so in place of any required subject of the Sophomore
year and take that required subject in the Junior year. Classical students
may elect work for two years. No work of less than one year is counted
toward graduation.
The aim of the instruction is to give a fluency of reading, enabling the
student to master with comparative ease the modern writers; a speaking

35
knowledge; and an acquaintance with the literature, as far as the limita-
tions of time and the necessary drill in theory permit. No place is given to
that superficial system, resulting in a mere smattering of French phrases
and German idioms at the sacrifice of the real grasp of the subject.
Thoroughness of the work, the training of the powers of thought as well
as of memory, are as requisite in this branch of education as in any other.
A careful knowlege of grammatical principles, and correctness of pronoun-
ciation are made the foundation for future work. Prose composition is
continued during the entire course, special attention being given to the com-
plex nature of the German sentence. Conversation classes are formed under
suitable conditions. Simple prose reading is first taken up, followed by
more complicated style. The works read vary from year to year, but the
best authors, both classical and modern, are studied; the beauties of style,
the spfrit of the language, and the idiomatic expressions are pointed out.
Special emphasis is given to etymology and the laws of derivation ; the
relations of French to Latin, and German to English are shown; and con-
stant reference is made to the historical growth and development of the
languages, and the intimate connection of literature and history.
The third year is more of the nature of seminary work. Carefully
directed original investigation is required, certain periods of literature are
studied, authors critically read and their works analyzed. Lectures are
given from time to time in connection with class-room work.
ENGLISH LITERATURE.
In this department the aim is to familiarize the student with the most
important facts in the history of our Literature, also to throw light on the
great names of the authors, both British and American, connected with its
development.
The course will extend through four terms.
SPRING TERM : The history of English and American Literature.
Fall Term: The study of the masterpieces of Chaucer and Spenser and
their contemporaries.
Winter Term : The rise of Dramatic Literature, and the study of
Shakespeare, Bacon and Milton.
SPRING Term : A general survey of American Literature and study of
Hawthorne, Bryant, Longfellow, Lowell and Whittier Library work on
assigned themes in English Literature.

LOGIC
The following is an outline of the work:
Inductive and Deductive.
The fundamental laws of thought explained.
The syllogism, with copious illustrations.
The modes, figures, and their uses.
Discussion of fallacies.
HISTORY.
■ The work in Ancient History consists of an investigation of the earliest
civilizations with their development in language, religion, art, architecture,
science, and civil polity. A term is devoted to the nations of antiquity,
including the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, Babylonians.
Persians, Hindoos, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. The
work is done topically, this method being rendered possible by the standard
histories and works of reference in the College Library.
A term is devoted to English History and another term to French and
Germam History. In the Modern History an important feature is the
development of constitutional law and liberty.
MATHEMATICS
All students in the regular courses complete the work in Algebra, Geom-
etry and Trigonometry. Analytic Geometry is required in the Scientific
course. Surveying and Calculus are elective studies.
While the instruction in these various studies is designed to afford the
necessary basis for further work in pure and applied mathematics, the chief
aim is to promote habits of exact, logical reasoning and to stimulate origi-
nality and independence of thought. Special effort is made to develop
ability in mathematical analysis. To insure a thorough mastery of a subject
written reviews are held at frequent intervals. The problems assigned at
recitations are drawn largely from outside the text-book. From this work
the student acquires a keen and quick perception of principles, and accuracy
and readiness in their application.
In Surveying special prominence is given to field work. The student
becomes familiar with the use aqd adjustment of the instruments, and witt)

the methods employed in practical surveying. The work includes the cal-
culation of areas, chaining, triangulation, leveling, plotting, establishing
grades, dividing land and topographical surveying. The opportunity i>
offered in this department to take up more extended work in civil engineer-
ing, comprising railway location and construction, mechanics, hydromechan-
ics and hydraulic engineering.
SCIENCE.
CHEMISTRY .
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient, and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one ot the best in the West, is furnished with tables for
twenty-eight students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine balances,
and other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
Scientific students begin this study in the Fall term of Freshman year
and continue it for one year. Classical and Literary students may elect it
in Junior year. General chemistry is first considered and studied by aid of
text-book, lectures and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed
to aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science.
The students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and
learn, and report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues
through the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and labora-
tory work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative, or organic, may make
special arrangements for this purpose.
BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY.
In Biology the following courses are offered:
I. General Morphology of Invertebrates; Laboratory work with lectures,
ten hours per week, first term, and first half of second term.
II. General Morphology of Vertebrates. Continuation of course I. Te«
hours second half second term, and eight hours, third term.
III. Elements of Vertebrate Histology and Embryology. Laboratory
work, with lectures, two hours, third term. To be taken with II.

IV. Advanced work by special arrangement, throughout the year, ten
hours.
V. Structural Botany. Cryptogams. Laboratory work, with lectures,
ten hours, second term.
VI. Structural Botany. Vascular Cryptogams, and Phaenogams. Con-
tinuation of course V, eight hours, third term.
VII. Physiological Botany. Lectures and laboratory work, two hours,
third term. To be taken with VI.
Course IV must be preceded by courses I, II and III. The nature and
extent of the work will be determined by consultation.
The Laboratory is fully equipped with apparatus and material, and is in
direct communication with the Museum, so that constant reference
may be made to its collections. Recent extensive additions have been
made to the equipment, so that the Laboratory now possesses twenty-six
compound, and twenty-four dissecting microscopes of the make of Zeiss,
Leitz and Zentmayer; Thoma and Minot microtomes, and a full line of
first-class accessories. The standard reference works and journals are
provided for the students' use in the Laboratory. For those who wish to
carry their work farther than given in the above courses, special arrange-
ments will be made.
In Geology, at present, but one course is offered, consisting of recita-
tions, lectures, and field work. The large mineralogical and paleontological
collections of the Museum, casts, photographs, models, maps, etc., are
daily used.
Two Journal Clubs are maintained, one in Biology, the other in Geology,
for the discussion of current literature, and the encouragement of original
investigation.
HUMAN ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authority, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the struc-
ture and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is
of great importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the
curriculum of study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts,
models, and dissections. The laboratory is furnished with a series of the
Auzoux models, consisting of a manikin, and enlarged models of the eye, ear,
brain, cerebellum and cord, larynx, etc. The work continues two terms.
PHYSICS.
Four terms are given to the study of Physics, one in the Preparatory
course and three in the College. Additional apparatus has recently been
purchased and laboratory practice forms a prominent feature of the work.


## p. 39 (#687) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
The apparatus is not for mere illustration, but for discovering and verifying
laws and principles. The collection includes an Atwood's machine of the
best German make, siren and sonometer made by Koenig, photometer, Nor-
renberg's polariscope and Browning's spectroscope, electrical generators,
motors and test instruments. To insure a symmetrical development of the
subject, the didactic method of instruction is used in connection with labor-
atory work. Thus the student acquires not merely empiric skill but a
knowledge of the achievements of others and the mathematical formulation
of the laws discovered.
In the work in Astronomy the students have the use of a sextant and
a srr.all telescope.
METEOROLOGY.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have
ample opportunity for special work in this practical science.
MUSIC.
The work in Music is open to students who are candidates for a degree,
who evince sufficient musical ability to pursue with profit the subjects of
Harmony, Counterpoint, and Musical History. A knowledge of the ele-
ments of music is required, before the subject of Harmony may be begun.
In this subject, the student is made acquainted with the working princi-
ples of Harmony, through the development of melody, and its suggested
harmonies.
Later, the works of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and other masters, are an-
alyzed. •
Harmony is begun in the Fall term, and continues one year.
Counterpoint follows the subject of Harmony in sequence, and continues
a year.
The text used is Bridge's Counterpoint.
The work in History of Music consists of an investigation of the develop-
ment of the art, from the earliest time to the present. The work is done
topically, this method being rendered possible by the many excellent histo-
ries and works of reference in the College Library.

PHYSICAL EXERCISE.
Inasmuch as good health is essential to successful study, special promi-
nence is given to Physical Culture. Systematic and regular exercise is
therefore required. For this purpose a convenient and commodious gymna-
sium has been provided. This building is a two-story wooden structure,
thirty-six by seventy-five feet. It contains bowling alleys, dressing
rooms, and Janitor's room, on the first floor; and a spacious hall on
the second floor, sixteen feet in height, and the size of the entire
building. The Gymnasium is furnished with modern equipment throughout,
the aim being to make it meet as nearly as possible the demands of the in-
stitution. The immediate supervision rests with a Committee and a Director
from the Faculty, and free instruction is given to all the students. Classes
in dumb-bells, Indian clubs, chest weights, etc,, are held daily at such
hours as best to accommodate the .students. Care is taken that the exer-
cise be adapted to the individual wants of each student, and is required of
all except members of the Senior class.

EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS.
Library and Reading Room.
The College Library contains 20,000 volumes, and also a large collection
of pamphlets. Its books have been selected with care, and with reference
to the work of both professors and students. Hence its growth has been
healthful, and adapted to the wants of the College. In addition to other
sources of income, the interest of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is annually
devoted to the purchase of books. This endowment, $15,000, is the gift of
the late Mrs. Lucy E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Connecticut, as a memorial of
her gifted son, whose name it bears.
The Library is classified rind arranged according to the Dewey system.
A card catalogue, both of authors and subjects, makes every book and its
contents easily accessible to every reader. Each student is allowed free ac-
cess to the shelves, also the privilege of drawing books from the Library.
The Library is open seven hours daily, except Sundays.
In connection with the Library is a Reading-Room, supplied with one-
hundred and forty periodicals and leading journals of news, politics, religion,
science, literature and art. These may be consulted, but cannot be with-
drawn from the Library.
The new Library building, Burrage Hall, takes its name from the late
Leonard Burrage, of Leominster, Massachusetts. The building is of the
Romanesque style of architecture, 11o feet in length by 52 feet in breadth,
and has a capacity for about 100,000 volumes. The substructure is of field-
stone—granite boulders—massive and solid; the superstructure, of Ionia
sandstone, warmer in color, and more susceptible to the touches of art. The
interior is finished in natural oak, and the walls simply decorated in warm
Tuscan colors. The first floor contains the Delivery Room, Librarian's
Office, two Cloak Rooms, Reading Room, and Stack Room. Above is a Mez-
zanine Room for cataloguing, a large Seminary Room, and a room for
Special Collections.
Burrage Hall is commodious, elegant, and complete in its appointments,
literally fire-proof in the stack room, and practically so throughout. It hap-
pily combines economy and convenience in its working arrangements, secu-
rity for tbe books, attractive, well-furnished and well-lighted rooms for its
readers, and the possibility of enlargement at moderate expense and without
change of the original plan. It thus affords a safe and permanent repository

for the Library, and invites all friends of the College to make frequent and
large additions to the present valuable collection. Gifts of books, manu-
scripts, pamphlets, and periodicals are very acceptable. Local histories, an-
niversary addresses, the literature of iinstitutions, and all documents relating
to American life and history are especially desired.
Former students and all friends of the College can do much to assist the
librarian in this work. Correspondence is respectfully solicited. The cost
of transportation will be borne by the Library on such donations as can be
used.
Science Library.
An important step has been taken in laying the foundation of a much
needed reference library of scientific books, for the use of the science
departments. This is to be located permanently in Mather Hall.
The Museum of Natural History.
The second floor of Mather Hall is devoted to the College Museum and
the Biological Laboratory. The former consists of a general zoological
collection, synoptically arranged, illustrating all forms of animal life; the
Brown Cabinet of Mineralogy and Conchology, containing over 20,000
specimens; the Botanical Museum, and the Palmer series of " Ward's Re-
productions."
Among the recent valuable additions to the Museum are
a series of Ziegler's wax models illustrative of embryological sub-
jects, the large collection of Minerals and Paleozoic fossils presented by
Mr. Allan Bourn, of New York City, and the numerous smaller collections.
The whole Museum is arranged so as to be of the greatest practical value to
the students, and is for worh rather than for mere exhibition.
Mather Hall.
This commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000, bears the
name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Connecticut, who was its chief donor.
It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides the College Museum it contains
two large Recitation Rooms, the Laboratories and Lecture Rooms for
Chemistry, Geology, and Biology, and the Signal Service Station.

Parsons Hall.
This building was named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who
gave liberally for its erection. It contains the College Office, Art
Rooms, five Recitation Rooms, and Dormitories for young men; also the
rooms of the Young Men's Christian Association.
This hall is under the care and control of the College Secretary.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder
of the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teachers, and
Matron, together with accommodations for seventy-five young women. It
is heated by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnish-
ed. The Annex, a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet, con-
tains a spacious Dining-Hall, also Kitchen and Laundry, besides commo-
dious rooms in the second story for students.
Views of some of these buildings and also of the Society Halls are
given in the frontispiece. The location of these buildings and of the
Conservatory, Church, Gymnasium, and President's House is shown on the
accompanying diagram of the Campus.

GENERAL INFORMATION.
Preliminary Arrangements.
On reaching town for the first time, young men entering the College
classes may obtain any needed information from Prof. Joseph L Daniels,
Acting President; young men in the Normal Department, from Prof.
Joseph Estabrook; in the Preparatory Department, from Principal Hamilton
King; and young women in any department, from the Principal of the Young
Women's Department, Miss Flora Bridges. Correspondence may be
addressed to any of the above named persons, or to Albert L. Lee, Secretary
of the College.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions oi
learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
Students will be amenable to the regulations of the College from the
time of their arrival.
No one under fourteen years of age will be admitted to the institution
except by vote of the Faculty.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining
full membership. If during this period their scholarship, conduct, or
character is such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or unadvis-
able, they may be so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without
any further action, and whenever a student's influence is found to be bad,
the Faculty may separate him from the College without making formal
charges.
Any student in good standing, provided no unsettled accounts appear
against him, may, if he request it, receive an honorable dismission.
Entrance Examinations.
Entrance examinations will begin at 9 A. M., Wednesday, the day be-

fore the opening of the term, and all new students are expected to reach
town in time for this work.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects
studied by the class to which the admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to any of the college classes, who are deficient
in three prescribed studies, may be received conditionally; but such
conditions must be removed before the end of the year.
Candidates from schools on the University list and from.other schools
approved by the Faculty may be admitted to the Freshman class without
examination, provided they bring a certificate signed by the head of the
school, and showing a satisfactory standing in the studies'therein pursued.
All others must sustain a creditable examination before^assignment to
classes.
Rules for Classifying Students in this Catalogue,
i. Students may be admitted to tbe Freshman class, conditioned on
three terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be
advanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year the character of the majority of
the studies pursued during the year determines the class in which the
student shall be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted,
and the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given him, and may be given to his parent or guardian.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded
to a lower class, or dismissed from the College.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is
sent to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each
term. At the close of the College year all the classes are examined in the
presence of committees appointed annually by the Congregational Associa-
tion, and by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These exami-
nations are always publ ic.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-
atic prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this cat-
alogue; they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty elect such
studies as they prefer.

this College, has given f 1,000 to establish a prize in memory of his son,
John Downing Hewitt. It is awarded, at the close of the second year in
College, to that student in the Classical Course who has been regular in the
course and has ranhed highest in the regular studies of the Freshman and
Sophomore years. This prize was awarded to Henry Stoddard Curtis,
Olivet, in 1892.
Degrees and Diplomas.
The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon the graduates from the
Classical Course, that of Bachelor of Science upon the graduates from the
Scientific Course, and that of Bachelor of Letters upon the graduates from
the Literary Course.
Certificates are given to the graduates from the Normal Department and
to those completing the Short College Course.
After June, 1894, the Master's degree will be conferred in accordance
with the following provisions:
Any candidate who has taken the Bachelor's degree in Olivet College, or
in any other institution requiring an equivalent amount of work for that de-
gree, may be recommended for the corresponding Master's degree, provided
that for a period of one year of residence, or two years of non-residence, he
pursue a course of advanced, non-professional study, pass examination and
present a satisfactory thesis.
The course of study must be approved by the Committee on Degrees.
The fee for the Master's degree will be ten dollars.
Three members of the Faculty, one of them an instructor to whose de-
partment the studies pursued by the candidate especially belong, shall
constitute the Committee on Degrees. Special classes will not be organized,
but post-graduate work in any department may be done under the direction
of the professors, and all the facilities of the library and laboratories will

Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies: the Soronian,
for young women, and the Phi Alpha Pi and the Adelphic, for young men.
All the exercises are open to visitors, and a friendly rivalry and healthy
enthusiasm make their weekly meetings both profitable to their members
and attractive to their friends. Their Annual Public Exercises are oc-
casions of great interest and of marked literary excellence. Two of the
societies have already adorned the campus with fine buildings, and plans
for a third hall are under consideration.
The Adelphic Hall is a gem of the monumental style of architecture,
built of field stone. It contains an Auditorium, Reception Rooms, and
Cloak Rooms on the first floor; a Library, Committee Rooms, and Janitor's
Room on the second floor.
The Phi Alpha Pi Hall in its style of architecture is a combination of
Swiss and Greek. It is built of native field stone laid in "Ashler" style and
elaborately trimmed with Lake Superior sandstone. The spacious portico
in front is supported by columns of red granite, and the roof and gables are
of Spanish tile. The building contains an Auditorium, Reception Hall,
Parlor, Library, and Cloak K lomson the first floor; Kitchen, Pantry, Com-
mittee Rooms, and Janitor's Rooms on the second floor.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the
College Chapel, and public religious worship every Sabbath morning.
Unless special request is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all
students are required to attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday schools in
the neighborhood of the College The annual missionary address before
these societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by
some speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are con-
ducted by the students during the College year.
The Young Men's Christian Association occupies a commodious suite of
rooms in Parsons Hall. These are neatly furnished and afford an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and add much to
the efficiency of the Christian work of the College.

50 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Young Women's Department.
All young women in the College are under the supervision of the Princi-
pal of this department, and the care of the Woman's Board.
It is desirable that all should be members of the family of the Principal
and Matron at Shipherd Hall. They are allowed, however, to secure rooms
and board with approved families of the place.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and board can be obtained either at the College or in private
families as preferred.
In Parsons Hall unfurnished rooms are rented to young men at from
ten to twenty-two dollars a year—or from thirteen to twenty-eight cents per
week, when two students occupy a room. Rooms in this building must be
secured from the College Secretary, and only quiet and studious young men
are admitted. Noisy or disorderly students may be removed at any time.
Rooms in Parsons Hall are rented only by the year, and no occupant is
allowed to board himself in this hall.
In Shipherd Hall young women may secure furnished rooms and board
at from $3.00 to $3.50 for each student, provided two occupy the same room.
Board, with room furnished for one, from $3.50 to $3 75. These prices
include fuel and lights.
Rooms in this hall cannot be engaged for less than a term.
The charge for washing is fifty cents a dozen. Those who do their own
washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents for the use of the
laundry.
Every occupant of this hall furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips,
her towels and napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick
boots, overshoes and water proof cloak.
Young men also may obtain table board at Shipherd Hall at $2.00 per
week.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the board as near cost as possible,
and these'prices may vary as necessity requires.
In Private Families students may secure board and rooms subject to
the following regulations:
No student shall room or board in any place not approved by the Fac-
ulty; nor room in a house not otherwise occupied, except by special per-
mission of the Faculty.
Young men and young women will neither board nor room at the same
place in the town.
Table board in families is from $2.00 to $2.50 per week.
Board and rooms are from $2.50 to $4.50 per week, fuel and lights in-
cluded.


## p. 51 (#699) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. SI
Students who are willing to live plainly reduce their expenses by boarding
in clubs; the price of club board has for the past three years ranged from
f 1.25 to ti.90 a week.
Application for rooms and board may be made either in person or by
letter to the College Secretary.
Expenses.
Tuition in all classes is $5.00 a term.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No deduc-
tion will be made for absence, except in case of protracted illness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music and
Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $5.00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Treasurer's
receipt for them must be presented to the Registrar before the student can
enter his classes.
Text-books are furnished by the College at actual cost.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.—To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred.
Necessary Expenses.—The following may be considered a near estimate
of the necessary expenses of a student for an average term of twelve weeks.
It is made upon the supposition that two students occupy the same room.

An incidental fee of S2.50 will be charged regular conservatory students.
Students in any of the regular College Courses who elect one or more
studies in music shall pay for that instruction as scheduled above, except
the incidental fee.
Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to
remit the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing
for the ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship
and character proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not
extend to the incidental charge, to room rent, nor to the tuition in any study
outside of the regular course.
Young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing for the
ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American College and
Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids students under
the care of the Presbytery to the amount of $100 to $132 a year.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily need to leave the College for lach of means.
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited means,
but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually find


## p. 53 (#701) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 63
employment for themselves about the College or in the village with satisfac-
tory compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies. A
limited number of the young women at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of
their board by assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the
homes of the village. A few students, by rigid economy and hard work,
meet all their expenses from their earnings while studying, but in such cases
health and studies are likely to suffer. No one should come, even for one
term, without at least thirty or forty dollars at his command for use if
needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few students, as provided for else-
where, and the College has funds for otherwise aiding to some extent certain
classes of needy students. The great advantage Olivet College offers
students of this class, however, is the very low rate at which all its facilities
are furnished. With the practice of economy in all expenditures, one
hundred dollars, added to the earnings of one or two hours' work a day, can
be made to meet all necessary expenses for a College year. The traditions
of the College, and the public sentiment of the students, favor economy in
all expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after the
opening day of the term, will not be reserved unless the rent has been paid.
No student shall prolong his absence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required
exercise.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution and by-laws, and usages of all societies of the students
shall be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the Faculty.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near the
line of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, and between Lansing and
Battle Creek.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversi-
fied surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at
once attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as
beautiful, and the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College

64 OLIVET COLLEGE.
was founded by earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both
their own culture, character and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility
between town and College are unknown at Olivet. As a result the atmos-
phere of the place is free from those things which divert or hinder the
special work of the student, and most favorable to quiet, earnest, successful
study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor
of total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be sold.
For Catalogues and other information, address Acting President
Joseph L. Daniels, or Albert L. Lee, Secretary of the College.

NOTE.-The subjects printed in italics are elective.


## p. 58 (#706) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
This department is under the same general supervision as the other de-
partments, and under the immediate Sirection and management of the
principal. The members enjoy the same privileges and are subject to the
same regulations as the students in the College. Each group of subjects
is taught by a college graduate who is a specialist of experience and ability.
Terms of Admission.
To enter the Junior Year applicants must have pursued the English
Grammar through syntax, U. S. History through the Revolutionary Period,
the elements of Civil Government, Reading and Spelling, and must have
completed the study of Arithmetic, including the metric system. Any who
are not fully prepared to enter may take up these subjects in the Review
Class of the Normal Course, (see page 71), at the same time they are pursu-
ing regular work. Students who bring satisfactory certificates from any
school of good standing will not be examined in the branches to enter the
Junior Year, but each subsequent recitation will be regarded as an exami-
nation. A student will be dropped at any time from a class in which he
does not perform satisfactory work.
Candidates for a higher standing will be examined in the studies pre-
viously passed by the class they wish to enter.
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies
are accepted from several high schools of the state, of whose thoroughness
the faculty have assured themselves, and from schools on the University
list.
The school is not a suitable one for students who are idle, wayward or
averse to study, or for such as require the supervision of a teacher, and the
routine of a school-room to enforce industry and fidelity.
All students are expected to bring certificates of good character, and if


## p. 59 (#707) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 60
possible, satisfactory certificates of studies pursued elsewhere. No one
under fourteen years of age will be received.
The principal may be found in the college office on Wednesday, the day
previous to the opening of each term, for consultation in reference to studies
and rooms. The regular work of the classes begins on Friday, hence it is
essential that students obtain their schedules of study and become settled in
their rooms on Thursday.
Classes and Courses.
The regular work is arranged in three classes, each covering one year.
It provides three courses—Classical, Scientific, and Literary. A gradu-
ate of the Classical course may enter the Classical course of Olivet College
without examination. This preparation will enable a student to enter any
other-American college. A graduate of the Scientific course may enter the
Scientific course of Olivet College without examination. This preparation
will enable a student to enter the best Scientific schools in the country. A
graduate of the Literary course may enter the Literary course of Olivet
College or the Literary or Philosophical course of other colleges.
Besides the course preparing for the regular college courses, this depart-
ment offers the Preparatory Course for the Short College Course (p. 31).
This preparation will enable a student to enter the Short Course of Olivet
College. This course is an attempt to meet the needs of the large number
of young men and young women who feel the need of a better preparation
for life's work, but do not feel that they can complete a full-college course
of study. To all such a careful consideration of the characteristics of this
course as set forth on page 31 is commended. The work of the first three
years of the Normal course (p. 71) is done in this department.
Students are expected to have three hours of recitation each day, for five
days in the week, besides rhetoricals and physical exercise.
Diplomas are given to graduates from any of the above courses.
The work in general aims at two points—teaching and training.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-
atic prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed.
A variety of optional and extrastudies is offered, especially in the Senior
Year, to meet the wants of students who are fitting for definite college re-
quirements, or are to enter advanced divisions in classics, mathematics,
natural sciences, or modern languages at the colleges; and also to provide
for ambitious students who may wish to broaden their preparation. It it
not practicable to show all the possible combinations in the "Courses of
Study" on pp 61-62.
All students of the department in their work have access to the privileges
of the College Library, and Museum; also of the Physical, Chemical, and
Zoological Laboratories,

00 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Reports and Deportment.
A report of each student's deportment and proficiency in work is sent to
parents every term and will be furnished on request at any time.
Students are not allowed to change their rooms except at the end of each
term, unless for reasons that cannot be foreseen. There is therefore need
of care in selecting rooms when students enter.
One of the greatest obstacles to the intellectual progress and moral im-
provement of students is the excessive amount of money furnished them by
parents and guardians. It is advised that all money be placed in the bank
and that students be required to render an itemized account to the parent
every week of all money expended. Students are forbidden to contract any
debts, or to have any accounts, except for board. Any person opening such
accounts with students without conferring with the principal will do so at Ais
own rish.
For further information, address
Hamilton King,
Principal of Preparatory Department,
Olivet, Michigan.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
ENGLISH.
GRAMMAR.
Candidates for admission to the Junior Year must have sufficient knowl-
edge of English Grammar to complete the study in one term.
The work in English Analysis is a thorough study of the structure of the
sentence and the grammar of its parts. Some poem as Snow Bound, Enoch
Arden or Lady of the Lake is analyzed by the class. Special attention is
given to moods, infinitives, participles and idioms.
RHETORIC.
The Rhetoric of the Senior Year is a study of the elements of effective
discourse. The aim is not to discuss theories but to apply principles.
Daily practice is the law of the class.
RHETORICALS.
One hour each week throughout the entire preparatory course is given to
English work, embracing Composition, Elocution and the study of English
classics.
I, II. III.
Composition in the Junior Year aims to tench the student to express his
thoughts clearly and correctly.
Attention is given to building and recasting sentences, outlining themes,
and word study. Weekly exercises are written by the students and corrected
by the teacher.

IV, V. VI.
Elocution is the special English work for the Middle Year.
The essentials of the science, including Form, Tone, Pitch, Movement,
etc., are taught, and weekly rehearsals with the teacher required.
. VII, VIII, IX.
In the Senior Year students prepare discussions and orations which are
given before the rhetorical divisions.
In addition to the work outlined, each term some English classic is read
by the class.
The : tudy in English classics for the current year embraces ths following:
Junior Year: Longfellow's Courtship of Miles Standish, Scott's Mar-
mion, Irving'ii Sketch Book.
Middle Year: Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, Scott's Ivanhoe,
Emerson's American Scholar.
Sknior Year: Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and As You Like It, the Sir
Koger de Onerley Papers in the Spectator, Hawthorne's House of Seven
Gables.
Essays are written on topics connected with the reading.
THK ANCIENT CLASSICS.
The aim of the preparatory work in Latin and Greek is to lay foun-
dation for higher scholarship.
Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin Grammar and Composi-
tion, Greek Grammar and Composition, and Roman and Greek History.
Past experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his
attainments in thes- subjects.
General information must not be regarded as an equivalent for technical
scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms and
usages of language.
To enter the Latin of the Junior Year a student must have a good work-
ing knowledge of the English Grammar A knowledge oi the elements of
the Latin language is found to be of great advantage.

Remarks—
i. Instruction is based upon the inductive method. This presupposes
familiarity, on the part of beginners, with English grammar. Only those
who are well grounded in English can successfully enter upon and prosecute
the work required. Some knowledge of Latin also is of great advantage.
Quality, not quantity, is emphasized, especially during the first two years.

with the subject, as far as the Revolution. A large amount of reading and
investigation is required, the purpose being to cultivate a spirit of inquiry
and to teach the student the sources of authority.
Grecian History: the outlines from the earliest times to 146 B. C.
Roman History: the outlines from the earliest times to the empire.
In most preparatory schools Grecian and Roman history are taught in
connection with the Greek and Latin language. The histories of these na-
tions are of such importance to the student that they are given independent
places in the curriculum.
The method will be the same as in the U. S. History.
SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT.
The Science of Government includes the study of the state and the
federal constitution and investigation of the principles that underlie repub-
lican institutions.

INSTRUCTION.
This School of Music offers the finest advantages for the study of Music
—Instrumental, Vocal and Theoretical—either exclusively or with other
studies. The methods of instruction are similar to those of the best Con-
servatories in this country and Europe. The courses of study are compre-
hensive and thorough, being arranged with a view to maintain a high stand-
ard of musical taste. The aim of the management is to secure a complete
mastery of all branches which are undertaken by the student, rather than
to give a superficial knowledge of a few pieces. A real education of the
musical faculties is accomplished, rather than a training in styles which are
to be blindly imitated by the pupil.
Four courses of study are offei ed:
i. A course in Piano, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
2. A course in Pipe Organ, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
3. A course in Vocal Music, Harmony, and Musical Composition.
4. A course combining work belonging to the three preceding courses.
A full course will take between four and five years. Talented students,
with diligence, may finish it in four years.
Being connected with the College, a double advantage is given the
student for musical and mental improvement, and it is the aim of the man-
agement to encourage and urge the musical student to such studies as
English Literature, Rhetoric, Modern Languages, anl History.
Who May Enter.
Students may enter without taking either of the Regular Courses, and
may pursue such a line of work and to such an extent as the teacher may
direct. Students who wish to enter any of the Regular Courses should have
finished the studies preparing for the Scientific or Literary Course of the
College (see page 58). v
The Pianoforte.
In the study of this instrument great attention is given to every detail of
technique. Especial care is taken to develop a true musical touch and an
expressive style of playing.
The following course is merely an outline, and will be varied by the
Director, to meet the needs of the different pupils:

breath; the production of a clear, full and resonant tone, free from the
throat ; distinct enunciation, the art of phrasing correctly, and the develop-
ment of a refined musical taste.

of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental
Music. A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon
its presentation Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in
subsequent study, a knowledge of it insuring facility in reading at sight.
The course of study requires three years.
The text-books used are Bussler's "Elements of Harmony," Richter's
"Harmony," Goetschiu's " H.irmony and Composition," Bridge's "Trea-
tise on Counterpoint," and Stainer's "Composition."

ed with many of the finest works of musical art. The Exhibition Concerts
occur at the close of the term, and are intended mainly to show the progress
and proficiency of the pupils. They are of a high order, and have received
great praise from those well qualified to judge. Students' Rehearsals take
place every Monday evening, at which time pupils perform vocal and instru-
mental selections. These rehearsals are of great value to the student, as
they afford an opportunity of playing before others.
The Glee Class and Choir afford ample opportunity for Chorus Singing.

all students. The Musical Guild, a society formed of, and managed by,
students of the Conservatory, meets every Monday. Its programmes consist
of Instrumental and Vocal Selections, Essays, and Criticism on Music.
Rules for Practice.
No pupil can take less than one hour a day, and two hours are little enough
for solid and satisfactory advancement.
Pupils are not expected to practice anything during practice hours excepting
their assigned worh.
Pupils can not omit practice without an excuse from the Director or
from their teacher.
Day Pupils.
To meet the growing demand for Musical instruction on the part of
residents of Olivet and vicinity who have no time or desire to take studies
in the College, the following arrangements have been made by the Con-
servatory:
Day pupils may be received from their homes who shall simply report
to their teacher for instruction at appointed hours and shall be exempt from
all connection with the College and also exempt from the incidental fee of

Olivet College owes its existence and prosperity to the generosity of the
friends of Christian Education. It believes that the number of those who
propose to give to meet its necessities is ever increasing. It is far better
for these to carry out their intention while living, as then they are sure
that their gifts reach their destination. It is also desirable that donations
be for general purposes. In bequests the corporate name of the College
must be used. The following form is commended:
I give and bequeath to Olivet College, located at Olivet, Eaton County,
Michigan, the sum of $ , to be used in such manner as its Trustees
may deem most useful to the College.
Those making specific bequests may vary the above form by inserting the
special object desired. To ascertain the more pressing needs of the College
correspondence with the President is invited.

SHORT COLLEGE COURSE.
In order to meet the necessities of a goodly number of students whose
circumstances do not at present warrant their undertaking a full college
course, a short elective course has been provided which may be completed
in two years.
For this course the same degree of preparation is required as for the
other college courses, and candidates for admission to the first year will bo
examined, as they may elect, on the requirements for admission to the
Freshman class in either of the Classical, Literary or Scientific courses.
All the studies of the college courses are open to the students of the
short course. Yet no student shall be allowed to elect a study which his
previous preparation does not fit him to pursue with advantage. All
students in this course are recommended to elect their studies in groups or
certain definite lines of work so that the best results may be attained.
On the completion of this course a certificate will be given showing the
amount and kind of work that has been done.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.
BIBLE STUDY.
The importance of a systematic and careful study of the Bible as the
prime factor in a Christian education has led the College to the adoption of
a well defined course which covers seven years. The first three years are
outlined in the work of the Preparatory Department. The course of study
in the College is as follows:
Freshman Year: The life of Christ as set forth in the gospels.
Sophomore Year: The planting and developing of the Jewish and
the Christian Church, Covenants, and Ordinances.
Junior Year: Internal and external Evidences of Christianity.
Senior Year: Doctrines and accompanying duties as set forth in the
Old Testament and Pauline Epistles. The shorter Catechism.
These exercises are held every Friday and all students are required to
attend.
PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY.
The course in Mental Philosophy begins with the Senior year and cov-
ers twenty weeks, or a term and a half. The text-book used is Ex-Presi-
dent Porter's, "The Elements of Intellectual Science." The material there
afforded is ample for the time allotted. The method of instruction is by
recitations, reviews, "quizzes," and final examinations through written and
Dral questions. The rival theories which the text touches are discussed as
time allows. The object in view is practical rather than scholastic. It is
to make this science " justify" the principles of all the sciences and thus
show itself to be' the prime philosophy."
The course in Moral Philosophy covers the last half of the Winter
term. The text-book used is Ex-President Hopkins's, "The Law of Love


## p. 31 (#787) #############################################

OLIVE1 COLLEGE. 31
and Love as a Law." From time to time reference is made to his "Outline
Study of Man.'' The method of instruction is similar to that employed in
Mental Philosophy. But a thesis upon some point connected with the
science may take the place of the final examination.
The course in Political Economy covers the Spring term of eleven
weeks. The text-book used is Walker's "Political Economy," abridged
from the third edition of his " Manual of Political Economy." The method
of instruction is by recitations and constant reviews. Instead of a final
examination every student is assigned a thesis upon some such practical
theme as Money, the Relations of Capital and Labor, Free Trade, Pro-
tection, and the like. The term closes with a few lectures in the history of
Philosophy or in Sociology.
In the study of Civil Liberty the following order of topics is observed:
Nature of personal civil liberty.
Ancient, mediaeval and Anglican and American liberty.
Guarantees and checks.
Growth of liberty, and nature of Institutional Government.
Lieber's text-book is used and the recitation is varied with familiar
lectures and discussions.
LANGUAGE.
GREEK.
The aim of this department is to give the student a knowledge of the
Greek language and through it an acquaintance with the literature and life
of the people.
First in order therefore is a careful examination of the structure and
idioms of the language. This is sought by the reading and study of the
great masterpieces of this wonderful people in their various forms of litera-
ture. These are taken up somewhat in their order of development. This
also gives essentially the historic growth of the language and its people.
Thus Homer is studied for its twofold charm as the earliest of epics and
as a vivid picture of the prehistoric life of the Greeks. Herodotus follows
with his graphic views of the world of his day. Thucydides depicts the
golden age of Athens. Xenophon and Plato introduce us to Socrates and the
philosophy of that period, ^schylus and Sophocles present us their master-
pieces in the drama, and Demosthenes the consummate art and eloquence of
the Attic orators. The Hellenistic Greek is also touched by a few lessons
in the New Testament.
The aim is to give the student a love for Greek literature and art, and
the breadth of culture which comes by familiarity with the greatest thinkers
and writers of antiquity.


## p. 32 (#788) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
LATIN.
The first part of the course in Latin aims chiefly to ground the student
thoroughly in the elements and structure of the language, though even here
sight is not lost of the pleasure and culture to be gained from consideration
of the subject-matter of works read. The last three, and more especially
the last two, years are devoted chiefly to acquainting the student with what
is, for purposes of general culture, best in the Latin language. Therefore
constant grammatical drill on a limited amount of text characterizes the first
stages of the course, while freedom from the necessity of considering ele-
mentary matters leaves the student opportunity in the later years for more
rapid reading, and a more serious investigation of the literature, history,
manners and customs, and other matters touching the life of the ancient
Romans. The most advanced students work up from the original sources
papers on topics assigned.
For one day of each week, or an equivalent, after the Freshman year,
students are given independent work—i. e., work on which they do not have
formal recitation, but merely examination at the close of the term—and the
recitation hour thus gained is spent in reading at sight the easier works of
Latin literature.
Prose composition is practiced throughout the Freshman year; reading
at sight throughout the course.
Juniors and Seniors work together, the work being changed from year
to year.
Latin is pronounced according to the Roman method.
FRENCH AND GERMAN.
Two years' work of five recitations weekly is required in the Scientific
and Literary courses. A third year is optional. Scientific and Literary
students after completing two years' work in either French or German, may
elect for a third year's study the work of the first year in French or German.
Literary students, wishing to continue the study of French or German a
third year, may do so in place of any required subject of the Sophomore
year and take the required subjects in the Junior year. Classical students
may elect work for two years. No work of less than one year is counted
toward graduation.
The aim of the instruction is to give a fluency of reading, enabling the
student to master with comparative ease the modern writers: a speaking
knowledge; and an acquainance with the literature, as far as the limitations
of time and the necessary drill in theory permit. No place is given to that
superficial system, resulting in a mere smattering of French phrases and
German idioms at the sacrifice of the real grasp of the subject.


## p. 33 (#789) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 33
Thoroughness of the work, the training of the powers of thought as
well as of memory, are as requisite in this branch of education as in any
other. A careful knowledge of grammatical principles, and correctness of
pronounciation are made the foundation for future work. Prose composition
is continued during the entire course, special attention being given to the
complex nature of the German sentence. Conversation classes are formed
under suitable conditions. Simple prose reading is first taken up, followed
by more complicated style The works read vary from year to year, but
the best authors, both classical and modern, are studied; the beauties of
style, the spirit of the language, and the idiomatic expressions are pointed
out. Special emphasis is given to etymology and the laws of derivation;
the relations of French to Latin, and German to English are shown; and
constant reference is made to the historical growth and development of the
languages, and the intimate connection of literature and history.
The third year is more of the nature of seminary work. Carefully
directed original investigation is required, certain periods of literature are
studied, authors critically read and their works analyzed. Lectures are
given from time to time in connection with class-room work.
ENGLISH LITERATURE
In this department the aim is to familiarize the student with the most
important fncts in the history of our Literature, also to throw light on the
great names of the authors, both British and American, connected with its
development.
The course will extend through four terms.
Spring Term: The history of English and American Literature.
Fall Term: The study of the masterpieces of Chaucer and Spenser
and their contemporaries.
Winter Term: The rise of Dramatic Literature, and the study of
Shakespeare, Bacon, and Milton.
Spring Term: A general survey of American Literature and study of
Hawthorne, Bryant, Longfellow, Lowell and Whittier. Library work on
assigned themes in English Literature
LOGIC.
The following is an outline of the work:
Inductive rnd Deductive.
The fundamental laws of thought explained.


## p. 34 (#790) #############################################

U OLIVET COLLEGE.
The syllogism, with copious illustrations.
The modes, figures, and their uses.
Discussion of fallacies.
HISTORY.
The work in Ancient History consists of an investigation of the earliest
civilizations with their development in language, religion, art. architecture,
science, and civil polity. A term is devoted to the nations of antiquity,
including the Egyptians. Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes, Babylonians,
Persians, Hindoos, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. The work
is done topically, this method being rendered possible by the standard
histories and works of reference in the College Library.
A term is devoted to English History and another term to French and
German History. In the Modern History an important feature is the
development of constitutional law and liberty.
MATHEMATICS
All students in the regular courses complete the work in Algebra, Geom-
etry and Trigonometry. Analytic Geometry is required in the Scientific
course. Surveying and Calculus are elective studies.
While the instruction in these various studies is designed to afford the
necessary basis for further work in pure and applied mathematics, the chief
aim is to promote habits of exact, logical reasoning and to stimulate origi-
nality and independence of thought. Special effort is made to develop
ability in mathematical analysis. To insure a thorough mastery of a subject
written reviews are held at frequent intervals. The problems assigned at
recitations are drawn largely from outside the text-book. From this work
the student acquires a keen and quick preception of principles, and accuracy
and readiness in their application.
In Surveying special prominence is given to field work. The student
becomes familiar with the use and adjustment of the instruments, and with
the methods employed in practical surveying. The work includes the cal-
culation of areas, chaining, triangulation, leveling, plotting, establishing
grades, dividing land and topographical surveying. The opportunity is
offered in this department to take up more extended work in civil engineer-
ing, comprising railway location and construction, mechanics, hydromechan-
ics and hydraulic tngineering.

SCIENCE.
CHEMISTRY.
This department occupies well-lighted, convenient and well-furnished
rooms, for lecture and laboratory purposes, in Mather Hall.
The Laboratory, one of the best in the West, is furnished with tables
for twenty-eight students, and supplied with water, gas, chemicals, fine
balances, and other apparatus for work in general and analytical chemistry.
Scientific students begin this study in the Fall term of Freshman year
and continue it for one year. Classical and Literary students may elect it
in Junior year. General chemistry is first considered and studied by aid of
text-book, lectures and laboratory practice.
The laboratory practice consists of a prescribed course of experimental
work, following the same line as that of the lecture-room work, and designed
to aid in illustrating and enforcing the leading principles of the science.
The students make careful notes, at the time, of what they do, see, and
learn, and report the same in writing.
The course in analysis begins with the Winter term and continues
through the remainder of the year.
Ten hours per week are regularly required for lecture-room and labora-
tory work. Extra time, if desired, may be had by special arrangement.
Students, or other persons, who are prepared, and who may wish to do
advanced work in analysis, qualitative, quantitative, or organic, may make
special arrangements for this purpose.
BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY.
In Biology the following courses are offered:
I. General Morphology of Invertebrates; Laboratory work with daily
lecture and quiz, ten hours a week, first term.
II. General Morphology of Vertebrates; continuation of I, ten hours a
week, second term.
III. (a.) Principal theoretical problems of Biology. Lectures and quiz-
zes, two hours a week, third term. Conclusion of I and II. (A.) Elements of
Vertebrate Embryology. Lectures. Laboratory work (development of
chick and frog) eight hours a week. Must be taken with I, II, and III. (a)
IV. Extra work by special arrangement in Vetebrate Histology or Com-
parative Osteology of Vertebrates, throughout the year, ten hours a week.
Must be preceded by I, II, and III.
V. Structural Botany, Cryptogams, Recitations and Laboratory work,
ten hours a week, second term.

Laboratory work. (l>.) Physiological Botany. Lectures, ten hours a week,
third term. ((a.) and (&.)).
The Laboratory is fully equipped with apparatus and material, and is
in direct communication with the Museum, so that constant reference may
be made to its very complete collections. The Laboratory possesses twenty-
six compound and twenty-four dissecting microscopes (Zeiss, Leitz and
Zentmayer), Thoma and Minot microtomes, large paraffine bath for general
use, and a full line of first-class accessories. Standard reference works are
provided for use of students in Laboratory.
In Geology, one course; is at present offered, consisting of recitations,
lectures and field work. The large mineralogical and paleontologies! col-
lections, casts, photographs, models and maps are constantly used.
A reading club will be maintained in Biology, various subjects being
selected for discussion.
HUMAN ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE.
A knowledge of Physiology and Hygiene is made, by State authority, a
legal requirement of all public school teachers. A knowledge of the struc-
ture and physiology of the human body and of the general laws of health is
of great importance; hence this subject has a prominent place in the
curriculum of study, and is taught by the aid of text-books, lectures, charts,
models, and dissections The laboratory is furnished with a series of the
Auzoux models, consisting of a manikin, and enlarged models of the eye.
ear, brain, cerebellum, and cord, larynx, etc. The work continues two
terms.
PHYSICS.
Four terms are given to the study of Physics, one in the Preparatory
course and three in the College. Additional apparatus has recently been
purchased and laboratory practice forms a prominent feature of the work.
The apparatus is not for more illustration, but for discovering and verifying
laws and principles. The collection includes an Atwood's machine of the
best German make, siren and sonometer made by Koenig, photometer, Nor-
remberg's polariscope and Browning's spectroscope, electrical generators,
motors and test instruments. To insure a symmetrical development of the
subject, the didactic method of instruction is used in connection with labo-
ratory work Thus the student acquires not merely empiric skill but a
knowledge of the achievements of others and the mathematical formulation
of the laws discovered.
In the work in Astronomy the students have the use of a sextant and a
small telescope.


## p. 37 (#793) #############################################

OLJVET COLLEGE. 37
METEOROLOGY.
The College has been incorporated as the seat of a Signal Service Station.
Regular observations are taken, and such students as are interested have
ample opportunity for special work in this practical science.
MUSIC.
The work in Music is open to students who are candidates for a degree,
who evince sufficient musical ability to pursue with profit the subject of
Harmony, Counterpoint, and Musical History. A knowledge of the ele-
ments of music is required, before the subject of Harmony may be begun.
In this subject, the student is made acquainted with the working prin-
ciples of Harmony, through the development of melody, and its suggested
harmonies.
Later, the works of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and other masters, are
analyzed.
Harmony is begun in the Fall term, and continues one year.
Counterpoint follows the subject of Harmony in sequence, and continues
a year.
The text used is Bridge's Counterpoint.
The work in History of Music consists of an investigation of the devel-
opment of the art, from the earliest time to the present. The work is done
topically, this method being rendered possible by the many excellent histo-
ries and works of reference in the College Library.
ELOCUTION.
Training of the body: general bearing; gymnastics for the tongue,
jaws, lips, throat, cheeks; breathing exercises to develop the chest and to
strengthen the lungs; gesture.
Training of the voice: correct method of breathing; control of breath;
purity, resonance, flexibility, and power of tone, enunciation, articulation,
pronunciation; placing of voice to express various emotions; evolution of ex-
pression.
The work extends through the college course with thirty minutes of
class drill each week. Fifteen minutes of practice required each day.


## p. 38 (#794) #############################################

PHYSICAL CULTURE.
Taking into consideration the fact that a sound mind in a sound body is
the mind which has the greatest power of acquisition, and that weakness or
disease of any function has a detrimental effect upon every other element
of life, a special prominence is given to Physical Culture. Systematic and
regular exercise is therefore required. For the purpose a convenient and
commodious gymnasium has been provided. This building is a two-story,
wooden structure, thirty-six by seventy-five feet. It contains bowling alleys,
dressing rooms and janitor's room on the first floor; and a spacious hall on
the second floor, sixteen feet in height and the size of the entire building.
The equipment of the Gymnasium is such as will meet the needs of the
best modern Physical Culture. The immediate supervision rests with a
Committee and a Director from the Faculty, and free instruction is given to
all the students. Classes are held daily, and among other things, free
calisthenic exercises, dumb-bells, and wand drills, Indian club swinging
and the Swedish system of Educational Gymnastics are given in such a way
as to best meet the requirements of systematic physical development. The
chest-weights are used to strengthen those muscles which are weak, and, in
addition to the various drills, complete a most effective system of body-
building work. The most approved methods of Anthropometry are used by
the Directors in making physical examinations, which every student is re-
quired to take, and should weakness of and variation from normal physical
proportions necessitate a special prescription of exercise, such will be given.

EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS.
Library and Reading Room.
The College Library contains 21,000 volumes, and also a large collec-
tion of phamphlets. Its books have been selected with care, and with ref-
erence to the work of both professors and students. Hence its growth
has been heathful, and adapted to the wants of the College. In addition to
other sources of income, the interest of the Willie Sage Tuttle Fund is an-
nually devoted to the purchase of books. This endowment, $15,000, is the
gift of the late Mrs. Lucy E. Tuttle, of Guilford, Connecticut, as a memorial
of her gifted son, whose name it bears.
The Library is classified and arranged according to the Dewey system.
A card catalogue, both of authors and subjects, makes every book and its
contents easily acessible to every reader. Each student is allowed free ac-
cess to the shelves, also the privilege of drawing books from the Library.
The Library is open seven hours daily, except Sundays.
In connection with the Library is a Reading Room, supplied with one
hundred and forty periodicals and leading journals of news, politics, religion,
science, literature and art. These may be consulted, but cannot be with-
drawn from the Library.
The new Library building, Burrage Hall, takes its name from the late
Leonard Burrage, of Leominster, Massachusetts. The building is of the
Romanesque style of architecture, 11o feet in length by 52 feet in breadth,
and has a capacity for about 100,000 volumes. The substructure is of field-
stone—granite boulders—massive and solid; the superstructure, of Ionia
sandstone, warmer in color, and more susceptible to the touches of art. The
interior is finished in natural oak, and the walls simply decorated in warm
Tuscan colors. The first floor contains the Delivery Room, Librarian's
Office, two Cloak Rooms, Reading Room and Stack Room. Above is a Mez-
zanine Room for cataloguing, a large Seminary Room, and a room for
Special Collections.
Burrage Hall is commodious, elegant and complete in its appointments,
literally fire-proof in the stack room, and practically so throughout. It hap-
pily combines economy and convenience in its working arrangements, secu-
rity for the books, attractive well-furnished and well-lighted rooms for its
readers, and the possibility of enlargement at moderate expense and without

change of the original plan. It thus affords a safe and permanent repository
for the Library, and invites all friends of the College to make frequent and
large additions to the present valuable collection. Gifts of books, manu-
scripts, pamphlets, and periodicals are very acceptable. Local histories,
anniversary addresses, the literature of institutions, and all documents re-
lating to American life and history are especially desired.
Former students and all friends of the College can do much to assist the
librarian in this work. Correspondence is respectfully solicited. The cost
of transportation will be borne by the Library on such donations as can be
used.
Science Library.
An important step has been taken in laying the foundation of a much
needed reference library of scientific books, for the use of the science de-
partments. This is to be located permanently in Mather Hall.
The Museum of Natural History.
The second floor of Mather Hall is devoted to the College Museum and
the Biological Laboratory The former consists of a general zoological
collection, synoptically arranged, illustrating all forms of animal life: the
Brown Cabinet of Mineralogy and Conchology, containing over 20,000
specimens; the Botanical Museum, and the Palmer series of "Ward's Re-
productions."
Among the recent valuable additions to the Museum are a series of
Ziegler's wax models illustrative of embryological subjects, the large col-
lection of Minerals and Paleozoic fossils presented by Mr. Allan Bourn, of
New York City, and the numerous smaller collections. The whole Museum
is arranged so as to be of the greatest practical value to the students, and
is for worh rather than for mere exhibition.
Mather Hall.
This commodious building, erected at a cost of about $25,000, bears
the name of Roland Mather, of Hartford, Connecticut, who was its chief
donor. It is devoted to scientific purposes. Besides the College Museum
it contains two large Recitation Rooms, the Laboratories and Lecture
Rooms for Chemistry, Geology, and Biology, the College Office and Signal
Service Station.

Parsons Hall.
This building^vas named in honor of Philo Parsons, of Detroit, who
gave liberally for its erection. It contains Art Rooms, six Recitation
Rooms, and Dormitories for young men; also the rooms of the Young Men's
Christain Association.
This hall is under the care and control of the College Secretary.
Shipherd Hall.
This building, named in honor of the Rev. John Jay Shipherd, founder
of the College, contains rooms for the Principal, Assistant Teachers, and
Matron, together with accommodations for seventy-five young women. It
is heated by furnaces, well ventilated, and neatly and comfortably furnished.
The Annex, "a substantial brick structure, sixty-five by forty feet, contains a
spacious Dining-Hall; also Kitchen and Laundry, besides commodious
rooms in the second story for students.
College Church.
The religious needs of the College in the early days led to the organiza-
tion of the First Congregational Church of Olivet. Unitedly the church
and College have worshiped together from the beginning. The growth of
each has demanded the erection of a much larger house of worship. The
new, elegant stone Church is nearing completion, and will be ready for use
at the next Commencement.
Views of some of these buildings and also of the Society Halls are
given in the frontispiece. The location of these buildings and of the Con-
servatory, Gymnasium, and Chapel is shown on the accompanying diagram
of the Campus.

GENERAL INFORMATION.
Preliminary Arrangement.
On reaching town for the first time, young men entering the College
classes may obtain any needed information from President Willard G.
Sperry; young men in the Normal Department, from Prof. Joseph Estabrook;
in the Preparatory Department, from Principal Hamilton King; and young
women in any department, from the Principal of the Young Women's De-
partment, Miss Grace J. Haynes. Correspondence may may be addressed
to any of the above named persons, or to Albert L. Lee, Secretary of the
College.
Membership and Dismission.
Applicants for admission to any department of the College must present
satisfactory testimonials of good character, and, if from other institutions
of learning, certificates of honorable dismission.
Students will be amenable to the regulations of the College from the
time of their arrival.
No one under fourteen years of age will be admitted to the institution
except by the vote of the Faculty.
Students are connected with the College three months before attaining
full membership. If during this period their scholarship, conduct, or
character is such as to render a longer connection unprofitable or inadvis-
able, they may be so informed privately, and allowed to withdraw without
any further action, and whenever a student's influence is found to be bad, the
Faculty may separate him from the College without making formal charges.
Any student in good standing, provided no unsettled accounts appear
against him, may, if he request it, receive an honorable dismission.
Entrance Examination*.
Entrance examinations will begin at 9 A. M., Wednesday, the day be-
fore the opening of the term, and all new students are expected to reach
town in time for this work.


## p. 44 (#800) #############################################

44 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Candidates for advanced standing will be examined in the subjects
studied by the class to which admission is desired.
Candidates for admission to any of the college classes, who are defi-
cient in three prescribed studies, may be received conditionally; but such
conditions must be removed before the end of the year.
Candidates from schools on the University list and from other schools
approved by the Faculty may be admitted to the Freshman class without
examination, provided they bring a certificate signed by the head of the
school showing a satisfactory standing in the studies therein pursued.
All others must sustain a creditable examination before assignment to
classes.
Rules for Classifying Students in this Catalogue.
1. Students may be admitted to the Freshman class, conditioned on
three terms' work in any subject or subjects.
2. All such conditions must be removed before the student can be ad-
vanced to a higher class in College.
3. After the Freshman year the character of the majority of the stud-
ies pursued during the year determines the class in which the student shall
be catalogued.
Scholarship and Studies.
The daily recitations of each student in every study are carefully noted,
and the average is recorded for permanent reference.
If a student does not exhibit a satisfactory degree of proficiency in any
study, notice shall be given him, and may be given to his parent or guardian.
If he does not then make the required improvement, he may be remanded
to a lower class, or dismissed from the College.
At the close of each term the general average of the scholarship of each
student, as well as the statement of his attendance on prescribed duties, is
sent to his parent or guardian.
Examinations in all the studies pursued are held at the close of each
term.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-
atic prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed in this cata-
logue; they may, however, under the direction of the Faculty elect such
studies as they prefer.

Literary Societies.
The students sustain three prosperous literary societies: the Soronian,
for young women, and the Phi Alpha Pi and Adelpbic. for young men.
All the exercises are open to visitors, and a friendly rivalry and healthy
enthusiasm make their weekly meetings both profitable to their members
and attractive to their friends. Their Annual Public Exercises are occa-
sions of great interest and of marked literary excellence. Two of the societies
have already adorned the campus with fine buildings, and plans for a third
hall are under consideration.
The Adelphic Hall is a gem of the monumental style of architecture,
built of field stone. It contains an Auditorium, Reception Rooms, and
Cloak Rooms on the first floor; a Library, Committee Rooms, and Janitor's
Room on the second floor.
The Phi Alpha Pi Hall in its style of architecture is a combination of
Swiss and Greek. It is built of native field stone laid in "Ashler" style and
elaborately trimmed with Lake Superior sandstone. The spacious portico
in front is supported by columns of red granite, and the roof and gables are
of Spanish tile. The building contains an Auditorium, Reception Hall,
Parlor, Library, and Cloak Rooms on the first floor; Kitchen, Pantry, Com-
mittee Rooms, and Janitor's Rooms on the second floor.
Religious Culture.
All students are required to attend devotional exercises daily in the
College Chapel, and public religious worship every Sabbath morning.
Unless special request is made to the contrary by parents or guardians, all
students are required to attend public worship at the College Church.
The students sustain two organizations for religious and philanthropic
work, entitled the Young Men's and Young Women's Christian Associations.
They maintain weekly religious meetings, and conduct Sunday schools in
the neighborhood of the College. The annual missionary address before
these societies is delivered on Sunday evening of Commencement week by
some speaker from abroad. Monthly missionary meetings also are con-
ducted by the students during the College year.
The Young Men's Christain. Association occupies a commodious suite of
rooms in Parsons Hall, These are neatly furnished and afford an attractive
place for reading, Bible study, and religious meetings, and add much to
the efficiency of the Christain work of the College.

48 OLIVET COLLEGE.
Young Women's Department.
All young women in the College are under the supervision of the Prin-
cipal of this department, and the care of the Women's Board.
It is desirable that all should be members of the family of the Princi-
pal and Matron at Shipherd Hall. They are allowed, however, to secure
rooms and board with approved families of the place.
Rooms and Board.
Rooms and board can be obtained either at the College or in private
families as preferred.
In Parsons Hall unfurnished rooms are rented to young men at from
ten to twenty two dollars a year-or at from thirteen to.twenty-eight cents per
week, when two students occupy a room. Rooms in this building must be
secured from the College Secretary, and only quiet and studious young mtn
are admitted. Noisy or disorderly students may be removed at any time.
Rooms in Parsons Hall are rented only by the year, advance payments be-
ing required at the beginning of each term, and no occupant is allowed to
board himself without the permission of the Committee.
In Shipherd Hall young women may secure furnished rooms and board
at from $3.20 to $3.70 for each student, provided two occupy the same
room.
Board with furnished room for one, from S3.70 to S3.95. These prices
include fuel and lights.
Rooms in this hall cannot be engaged for less than a term.
The charge for washing is fifty cents per dozen. Those who do their
own washing are charged one dollar and twenty-five cents for the use of the
laundry.
Every occupant of this hall furnishes one pair of sheets and pillow-slips,
her towels and napkins, and should be provided with an umbrella, thick
boots, overshoes and water proof cloak.
Young men may also obtain table board at Shipherd Hall at $2.20 per
week.
It is the purpose of the College to keep the board as near cost as possi-
ble, and these prices may vary as necessity requires.
In Private Families students may secure board and rooms subject to
the following regulations:
No student shall room or board in any place not approved by the Fac-
ulty; nor room in a house not otherwise occupied, except by special permis-
sion of the Faculty.
Young men and young women will neither board nor room at the same
place in the town.


## p. 49 (#805) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE.
49
Table board in families is from $2.00 to $2.50 per week.
Board and rooms are from $2.50 to $4.50 per week, fuel and lights in-
cluded.
Students who are willing to live plainly reduce their expenses by board-
ing in clubs; the price of club board has for the past three years ranged
from $1.25 to $2.46 a week.
Application for rooms and board may be made either in person or by
letter to the College Secretary.
Expenses.
Tuition in all classes is $5.00 a term.
Tuition will in no case be charged for less than half a term. No de-
duction will be made for absence, except in cases of protracted illness.
No tuition is charged for instruction in the elements of Vocal Music
and Free-Hand Drawing.
An Incidental Charge of $5 00 is made each term for care of public
rooms and repairs.
Tuition and incidental charges are paid in advance, and the Secretary's
receipt for them must be presented to the Instructor before the student can
enter his classes.
Text-books are furnished by the College at actual cost.
The cost of washing is from fifty to sixty cents a dozen.
Graduation.—To meet the expense of the diploma five dollars are
charged for every degree conferred
Necessary Expenses.—The following may be considered a near esti-
mate of the necessary expenses of a student for an average term of twelve
weeks. It is made upon the supposition that two students occupy the same
room.

Beneficiary Aid.
The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees are authorized to
remit the tuition of any young man in the College Course who is preparing
for the ministry of any evangelical denomination, and who by scholarship
aDd character proves himself fitted for the work. This favor does not ex-
tend to the incidental charge, to room rent, nor to the tuition in any study
outside of the regular course.
Needy young men in the Collegiate Classical Course who are preparing
for the ministry can ordinarily receive $75 a year from the American Col-
lege and Education Society.
The Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church aids studenis
under the care of the Presbytery to the amount of $100 to $132 a year.
Tuition is remitted to the daughters of Home and Foreign Missionaries.
The income of the Carter Fund is bestowed upon worthy young women
who need assistance.
No worthy student will ordinarily need to leave the College for lach cf
Facilities for Self-Support.
The College desires in every way to encourage students of limited
means, but it cannot furnish manual labor. Faithful young men can usually
find employment for themselves about the College or in the village with
satisfactory compensation, for all the time they can spare from their studies.
A limited number of the young women at Shipherd Hall can pay a part of

their board by assisting in the domestic work, and others find work in the
homes of the village. A few students, by rigid economy and hard work,
meet all their expenses from their earnings while studying, but in such
cases health and studies are likely to suffer. No one should come, even for
one term, without at least thirty or forty dollars at his command for use if
needed. Free tuition is furnished to a few students, as provided for else-
where, and the College has funds for otherwise aiding to some extent certain
classes of needy students. The great advantage Olivet College offers
students of this class, however, is the very low rate at which all its facilities
are furnished. With the practice of economy in all expenditures, one hun-
dred dollars, added to the earnings of one or two hours' work a day, can be
made to meet all necessary expenses for a College year. The traditions of
the College, and the public sentiment of the students, favor economy in all
expenses.
Regulations.
Damage done to rooms in the College buildings will be charged to the
occupants.
Rooms which have been engaged, and which remain unclaimed after
the opening d;;y of the term, will not be reserved unless the rent has been
paid.
No student shall prolong his nbsence beyond the close of vacation; and
after his arrival in town he must not absent himself from any required ex-
ercise.
The use of tobacco and intoxicating liquors is prohibited.
The constitution and by laws, and usuages of all societies of the stu-
dents shall be open to the knowledge and subject to the approval of the
Faculty.
Location.
Olivet College is situated in Olivet, Eaton County, Michigan, near
the line of the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway, and between Lansing
and Battle Creek.
Few villages in the State are better fitted by nature for a college than
Olivet. It crowns a hill embowered in forest and shade trees, with diversi-
fied surface which presents eligible sites for buildings. Its quiet beauty at
once attracts the notice of visitors. The place is healthful as well as beau-
tiful, and the climate wholesome. The village as well as the College was
founded by earnest Christian men, who early impressed upon both their

own culture, character and spirit. Hence dissensions and hostility be-
tween town and College are unknown at Olivet. As a result the atmos-
phere of the place is free from those things which divert or hinder the
special work of the student, and most favorable to quiet, earnest, successful
study.
There are few temptations. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in
favor of total abstinence, and no intoxicating liquors are allowed to be
sold.
For Catalogues and other information, address President Willard
G. Sperry, or Albert L. Lee, Secretary of the College.

66 OLIVET COLLEGE.
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT.
This department is under the same general supervision as the other de-
partments, and under the immediate direction and management of the
principal. The members enjoy the same privileges and are subject to the
same regulations as the students in the College. Each group of subjects
is taught by a College graduate who is a specialist of experience and ability.
Terms of Admission.
Students who bring satisfactory certificates from any school of good
standing will not be examined in the branches to enter the Junior year, but
each subsequent recitation will be regarded as an examination. A student
will be dropped at any time from a class in which he does not perform sat-
isfactory work.
Candidates for a higher standing will be examined in the studies pre-
viously passed by the class they wish to enter.
By special arrangement, certificates for any or all preparatory studies
are accepted from several high schools of the state, of whose thoroughness
the Faculty have assured themselves, and from schools on the University
list.
The school is not a suitable one for students who are idle, wayward
or averse to study, or for such as require the supervision of a teacher, and
the routine of a school-room to enforce industry and fidelity.
All students are expected to bring certificates of good character, and if
possible, satisfactory certificates of studies pursued elsewhere. No one
under fourteen years of age will be received.
The principal may he found in the College Office on Wednesday, the
day previous to the opening of each term, for consultation in reference to
studies and rooms. The regular work of the classes begins on Friday,
hence it is essential that students obtain their schedules of study and be-
come settled in their rooms on Thursday.


## p. 57 (#813) #############################################

OLIVET COLLEGE. 5t
Classes and Courses.
The regular work is arranged in four classes, each covering one year.
It provides three courses—Classical, Scientific and Literary. A gradu-
ate of the Classical course may enter the Classical course of Olivet College
without examination. This preparation will enable a student to enter any
other American college. A graduate of the Scientific course may enter the
Scientific course of Olivet College without examination. This preparation
will enable a student to enter the best Scientific schools in the country. A
graduate of the Literary course may enter the Literary course of Olivet
College or the Philosophical course of other colleges.
Besides the course preparing for the regular college courses, this de-
partment offers the Preparatory Course for the Short College Course (p. 29).
This preparation will enable a student to enter the Short Course of Olivet
College. This course is an attempt to meet the needs of the large number
of young men and young women who feel the need of a better preparation
for life's work, but do not feel that they can complete a full college course
of study. To all such a careful consideration of the characteristics of this
course as set forth on page 29 is commended. The work of the first three
years of the Normal course (p. 70) is done in this department.
Students are expected to have three hours of recitations each day, for
five days in the week, besides rhetorical and physical exercise.
Diplomas are given to graduates from any of the above courses.
The work in general aims at two points—teaching and training.
All students are earnestly recommended to enter at once on the system-
atic prosecution of some one of the courses of study prescribed.
A variety of optional and extra studies is offered, especially in the Sen-
ior Year, to meet the wants of students who are fitting for definite college
requirements, or are to enter advanced divisions in classics, mathematics,
natural sciences, or modern languages at the colleges; and also to provide
for ambitious students who may wish to broaden their preparation. It is
not practicable to show all the possible combinations in the "Courses of
study " on pp 54-61.
All students of the department in their work have access to the privi-
leges of the College Library, and Museum; also of the Physical, Chemical,
and Biological Laboratories.
Reports and Deportment.
A report of each student's deportment and proficiency in work is sent
to parents every term and will be furnished on request at any time.
Students are not allowed to change their rooms except at the end of

each term, unless for reasons that cannot be foreseen. There is therefore
need of care in selecting rooms when students enter.
One of the greatest obstacles to the intellectual progress and moral im-
provement of students is the excessive amount of money furnished them by
parents and guardians. It is advised that all money be placed in the bank
and that students be required to render an itemized account to the parent
every week of all money expended. Students are forbidden to contract any
debts, or to have any accounts, except for board. Any person opening such ac-
count with students without conferring with the principal will do so at his crwn
rish.
For further information, address
Hamilton King,
Principal of Preparatory Department.

GRAMMAR.
English Grammar, I and II, covers the general subject and prepares
for Analysis.
The work in English Analysis is a thorough study of the structure of
the sentence and the grammar of its parts. Some poem as Snow Bound.
Euoch Arden or Lady of the Lake is analyzed by the class. Special atten-
tion is given to moods, infinitives, participles and idioms.
ENGLISH,
i. II, III, IV, V, VI.
Composition in the Junior and Junior Middle Years aims to teach the
student to express his thoughts clearly and correctly.
Attention is given to building and recasting sentences, outlining themes,
and word study. Exercises are written by the students and corrected
by the teacher.

In the Senior Year students prepare discussions and orations which are
given before the rhetorical divisions. One hour each week is given to this
work during the fall and winter term of this year. A graduating thesis is
required as the English work of the spring term.
In addition to the work outlined, each term some English classic is
read by the class, and essays are written on topics connected with the read-
ing.
The study in English classics for the next three years embraces the fol-
lowing:
1894.—Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Merchant of Venice, Scott's Lady of
the Lake, Arnold's Sohrab and Rustum, Addison's Sir Roger de
Coverley Papers, Macaulay's Second Essay on the Earl of Chatham,
Emerson's American Scholar, Irving's Sketch Book, Scott's Abbott,
Dickens' David Copperfield,
1895.—Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Twelfth Night, Milton's
L'Allegro, II Penseroso, Comus and Lycidas, Longfellow's Evange-
line, Addison's Sir Roger de Coverley Papers, Webster's First
Bunker Hill Oration. Irving's Sketch Book, Scott's Abbott.
1896.—Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Midsummer Night's Dream,
Milton's L Allegero, II Penseroso. Comus and Lycidas, Longfellow's
Evangeline, Macaulay's Essay on Milton, Webster's First Bunker
Hill Oration, DeFoe's History of the Plague in London, Irving's
Tales of a Traveler, Scott's Woodstock, George Eliot's Silas Marner.
THE ANCIENT CLASSICS
The aim of the preparatory work in Latin and Greek is to lay founda-
tion for higher scholarship.
Emphasis is laid on the requirements in Latin Grammar and Composi-
tion, Greek Grammar and Composition, and Roman and Greek History.
Past experience shows that the candidate is liable to overestimate his
attainments in these subjects.
General information must not be regarded as an equivalent for tech-
nical scholarship; nor mere translation for systematic drill in the forms and
usages of language.

i. Instruction is based upon the inductive method. This presupposes
familiarity, on the part of beginners, with English grammar. Only those
who are well grounded in English can successfully enter upon and prosecute
the work required. Some knowlege of Latin also is of great advantage
Quality, not quantity, is emphasized, especially during the first two years.
2. Harkness grammar is used. For convenience of reference in the
class-room only text-books listed should be used in recitation.

OLIVET CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC,
This school was established in connection with Olivet College in 1874.
Its purpose is to afford superior advantages for pursuing the study of Music
in all its elementary and higher branches. The general plan of the school
is similar to that of the best Conservatories in this country and in Europe.
The course of study has been planned with reference to securing that sym-
metrical development which is essential to the true musician. Its connec-
tion with the College furnishes opportunity for the pursuance of studies along
other lines of intellectual improvement, and it is the aim of the management
to encourage the musical student in the attainment of a broad culture of the
mind as a substantial basis for future advancement.
Courses of Study.
Four courses of study are offered:
1. A course in Piano and Theory. (Including Harmony, Counter-
point, Analysis and Musical History.)
2. A course in Pipe Organ and Theory.
3. A course in Vocal Music and Theory.
4. A course combining work belonging to the three preceding courses.
A full course will take from four to five years. Those who wish to
enter on a course leading to a Diploma must give satisfactory evidence of
having made such attainments in their studies as will enable them to intel-
ligently pursue the curriculum of the Conservatory.
THE PIANOFORTE.
In the study of this instrument great attention is given to every detail of
technique, and to the development of a correct musical touch, since this is
necessary to give intelligent expression to musical thought and feeling. The
art of Phrasing and the study of Rhythm are especially emphasized, and every
effort is made to develop the intellectual side of musical study rather than
the purely emotional. The following course of study for the Piano is an
outline which may be followed or varied by the Director according to the
need of the individual pupil.

THEORY OF MUSIC AND COMPOSITION.
This study should be undertaken as early as possible, as by a knowledge
of it much time may be saved in the practice of Vocal and Instrumental
Music. A practical application of each principle is made immediately upon
its presentation. Theory thus becomes of great value to the student in sub-
sequent study. A knowledge of Theory insures facility in reading at sight.

enough for solid and satisfactory advancement. Pupils are not expected ts
practice anything during these hours excepting their assigned worh. Pupils
cannot omit practice or lessons without an excuse from the Director.
DAY PUPILS.
To meet the growing demand for musical instruction on the part of res-
idents of Olivet and vicinity who have no time or desire to take studies in
the College, the following arrangements have been made by the Conserv-
atory. Day pupils may be received from their homes who shall simply
report to their teacher for instruction at appointed hours, and shall be
exempt from all further connection with the College. Tuition will be the
same as for other Conservatory students with the exception of the incidental
fee. from which they will be exempt.
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
Recently a fine new Conservatory Building has been provided by the
Board of Managers. It is spacious, well lighted, heated and ventilated, and
is in every way a model for the purpose for which it has been prepared. The
practice rooms are well supplied with good pianos. Besides the music
rooms in the Conservatory Building, the Conservatory has the use of the
College church for the pipe organ.
Names must be registered and tuition paid before lessons are assigned.
Pupils are not received for a shorter period than one term.
Pupils must furnish or hire suitable instruments for practice.
Instruments can be hired at the Conservatory and in the village.
No deduction is made for absence from lessons, except in case of pro-
tracted illness when the Conservatory will share the loss equally with the
pupil.
Before a student can substitute music for any study in the Literary
course, he must have passed the first year in the Piano, Vocal or Pipe Organ
course, must have pursued the study of Theory for three terms and is
required to have devoted not less than two hours a day during the year's
work of piano or pipe organ study, and not less than one hour a day during
the year's work of Vocal study.

musical exercise without permission from the Director.

ble way; in every case where it can be done conscientiously, pupils will be
recommended for positions as teachers and organists.

verted into cash.

Olivet College owes its existence and prosperity to the generosity of the
friends of Christian Education. It believes that the number of those who
propose to give to meet its necessities is ever increasing. It is far better
for these to carry out their intention while living, as then they are sure that
their gifts reach their destination. It is also desirable that donations be for
general purposes. In bequests the corporate name of the College must be
used. The following form is commended:
I give and bequeath to Olivet College, located at Olivet. Eaton County,
Michigan, the sum of S , to be used in such manner as its Trustees
may deem most useful to the College.
Those making specific bequests may vary the above form by inserting the
special object desired. To ascertain the more pressing needs of the College
correspondence with the President is invited.
