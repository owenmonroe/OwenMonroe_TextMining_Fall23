CHAPTER V.
OF THE LIBRARY.
The Library Committee shall divide the books and other
articles belonging to the Library into three classes, namely:
(a) those which are not to be removed from the building; (b)
those which may be taken from the halls only by written
permission of three members of the committee, who shall
take a receipt for the same and be responsible for their safe
return; (c) those which may circulate under the following
rules.
Members shall be entitled to take from the Library one
folio, or two quarto volumes, or four volumes of any lesser
fold, with the plates belonging to the same, upon having them
recorded by the Librarian, or Assistant Librarian, and prom-
ising to make good any damage they sustain, while in their
possession, and to replace the same if lost, or pay the sum
fixed by the Library Committee.
No person shall lend any book belonging to the Institute
excepting to a member, under the penalty of one dollar for
every such offence.
The Library Committee may allow members to take more
than the allotted number of books upon a written application,
and may also permit other persons than members to use the
Library, under such conditions as they may impose.
No person shall detain any book longer than four weeks
from the time of its being taken from the Library, if notified
that the same is wanted by another member, under a penalty
of five cents per day, and no volume shall be retained longer
than three months at one time under the same penalty.
The Librarian shall have power by order of the Library
Committee to call in any volume after it has been retained by
a member for ten days.
On or before the first Wednesday in May, all books shall be
returned to the Library, and a penalty of five cents per day
shall be imposed for each volume detained.
Lables designating the class to which each book belongs
shall be placed upon its cover.
No book shall be allowed to circulate until one month after
its reception.

PREFACE.
THIS work is brief, but comprehensive, containing
all the important ideas of Elocution. Most works of
its character are burdened with complicated rules and
exceptions, so that but few, if any, attempt to master
them. I have endeavored to avoid this serious defect,
and to present a popular method, which every person
at once comprehends and finds pleasure in perusing.
This work is published, in part, for my own use as
a teacher of elocution, and also as a text-book for
teachers and students generally. The directions for
training and developing the vocal organs are explicit,
and the selections for elocutionary practice varied, and
from the best authors. An appreciation and use of
these will result in a rich, full-toned voice, and a
graceful and effective delivery.

ATWELL'S
EPITOME OF
OF ELOCUTION.
ELOCUTION.
ELOCUTION is the art which enables one to deliver
written or extemporaneous composition with ease, force,
accuracy, and variety, i. e., eloquently.
In this work we purpose to present only the more
practical thoughts.
THE VOICE.
As the voice is the capital of the orator, the means
for its development and improvement are first to be
considered. Its quality and compass depending upon
the condition of the vocal organs, the following exercises
are introduced to strengthen, and give to them freedom
of action.
BREATHING EXERCISES.
Exercise 1. ATTITUDE. The body must be erect,
resting upon the ball of the foot; one foot a little in
advance of the other, so that all the muscles of the
breathing apparatus may be free to perform their func-
tions.
(9)

ATWELL'S EPITOME OF ELOCUTION.
Exercise 2. INHALING AND EXHALING.
Inhale
through the nostrils a full breath, and send it forth
gently through them.
Exercise 3. INHALING AND EXPELLING. Inhale
as before, and expel vigorously in like manner.
Exercise 4. GENTLE BREATHING.—Inflate the lungs
through the mouth, and send the breath forth tran-
quilly, with a prolonged sound of the letter h.
Exercise 5. EXPLOSIVE BREATHING. Following
directions already given, emit with violent explosion
in the short sound of the letter k.
Exercise 6. RAPID BREATHING. Sigh, sob, gasp,
and pant.
These last-mentioned efforts, with which
all persons are familiar, will excite the organs intensely,
and also accustom the student to the expression of emo-
tions which enter into almost every style of composition.
Exercise 7. THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE CHEST.
Draw in and send forth the breath, causing all the
organs of the chest, to rise and fall freely at each effort.
Exercise 8. FOR THE LARYNX. - Utter the hard
sounds of b, d, g. This exercise enlarges the larynx
and tightens the vocal chords, and thus increases the
volume and quality of the voice.
―――――――
-
―――

Exercise 9. THE PERCUSSION OF THE CHEST.
Expand the chest by a full inhalation, and thump it
gently with the fingers, they being open and flexible.
Exercise 10. WHISPERING. Whisper the vowels,
and consonants, and also forcible passages.
Exercise 11. LAUGHING.
Utter rapidly the breath-
ing h.
To make the exercise more exhilarating and at-
tractive, prefix the clement h to the vowels a, e, i, o, u,
and utter them separately and earnestly.
.


## p. 11 (#15) ##############################################

RULES AND EXERCISES.
11
Exercise 12. VIGOROUS ENUNCIATION. Utter the
element o eight times; increase in force and volume to
the end.
Exercise 13. THE TREMOLO. Give forth tremu-
lous emissions of the breath; utter passages in this
voice.
-
MANY MORE EXERCISES.
There are many more exercises for the development
and strengthening of the organs of speech; but these,
faithfully practised, will accomplish all that any person
can desire in this direction. It is not the number that
we practice which benefits, but a judicious use of the few
more important ones.
PURITY OF TONE.
Purity of tone is absolutely essential to good speaking;
without it distinct articulation is impossible. In present-
ing this point we shall quote from the excellent work, by
Russell and Murdock, upon vocal culture:
"It is important that the pupil, at the very outset of
vocal study, should have the ability of appreciating purity
of tone. Unless he has some distinct perception of it, —
in other words, unless a model of pure tone has been
formed in his own mind, all merely physical effort to
acquire it will be likely to fail.
"The practice of the scale in swelling tones, is chiefly
relied upon by teachers of vocal music, for developing
the voice, and for acquiring purity, mellowness, flexi-
bility, and an adequate breadth of tone.
—

ATWELL'S EPITOME OF ELOCUTION.
"Immediately before singing cach sound, breath should
be taken so as completely to inflate the lungs; and after
pausing an instant with the chest well expanded, the
sound should commence with firmness, but with great
softness, then gradually augmented to the loudest de-
gree, succeeded by being as gradually diminished to the
degree of force with which it began. Each tone should
be prolonged from eighteen to twenty seconds.
"This exercise, as a general rule, should be continued
for about two months, singing the scale daily about four
times.
6
"In the delivery of the tones of the chest register,'
the air ought to escape without touching the surfaces of
the mouth; the tones of the 'medium register,' are best
acquired by directing the air a little above the upper
front teeth in those of the head register,' the air
is directed vertically."

PRONUNCIATION.
Under this head is embraced Articulation, Syllabica-
tion, and Accent. The two last particulars will not be
considered, as they are sufficiently understood by most
.readers. With regard to the first, attention will be
directed mainly to the errors so common and difficult
to remedy. A few special rules will also be given for
the correct pronunciation of certain particular letters and
words.

ERRORS IN ARTICULATION.
Errors in articulation are in consequence of the omis-
sion of one or more elements in a word, or from the
sounding of one or more clements that should not be
sounded, or from substituting one element for another.

REPETITION OF ELEMENTS.
get, &c.
To these few examples of mispronunciation the student
may add others, and by repeating them correctly, learn to
avoid them. There is no better exercise for improvement
in elocution. Especially may distinctness in utterance be
attained by pronouncing properly words ending with g, t,
ds, st. It is well to often repeat all the sounds of the
letters in the alphabet. Much attention should be given
to this in the early stages of education, where at present
it is generally neglected.
Hail! heavenly harmony.
Up the high hill he heaved a huge round stone.
Heaven's first star alike ye see.
Let it wave proudly o'er the good and brave.

ATWELL'S EPITOME OF ELOCUTION.
The supply lasts still.
And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming,
And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing,
And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping,
And curling and whirling and purling and twirling,
Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,
Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,
Advancing and glancing and prancing and dancing,
Recoiling, turmoiling and toiling and boiling,
And thumping and flumping and bumping and jumping,
And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing,
And so never ending, but always descending,
Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending,
All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar;
And this way the water comes down at Lodore.
It is the first step that costs.
The deed was done in broad day.
-
None now was left to tell the mournful tale.
Take care that you be not deceived, · dear friends.
Lie lightly on her, earth! her step was light on thee.
Thou wast struck dumb with amazement.
Can no one be found faithful enough to warn him of
his danger? No one dared do it.
A good deal of disturbance ensued.
He gave him good advice which he did not take.
A dark cloud spread over the heavens.
Had he but heeded the counsel of his friend, he might
have been saved.
He came at last too late to be of any service.
The magistrates stood on an elevated platform.

RULES AND EXERCISES.

CERTAIN PARTICULAR LETTERS AND WOrds.
1. Articles a, the, and the letter u.
a is pronounced as a in at.
EXAMPLE. - There was ǎ man, ă Loy, and ă cat.
2. The is unemphatic before words commencing with
a consonant sound, and is pronounced thu.
EXAMPLE.
3. U in such words as constitution, duty, is generally
mispronounced, having the sound of o in do, when it
should be soft like eu in beauty.
The unemphatic
-
- Thu people, the senators, thŭ king.
PAUSES.
to
Pauses are introduced for a variety of purposes
mark surprise, expectation, uncertainty; also to make
emphasis effective. Their importance may be over-
rated, as in a work entitled 'The Human Voice,' where
we are told that they, used with propriety, constitute
the beauty of clocution, while emphasis destroys it. The
number of them depends upon the character of the com-
position.
―――――――
PLAIN RULES FOR THEIR USE.
1. After a compound nominative or a single emphatic
nominative, a pause is necessary.
EXAMPLES.
Joy or sorrow, moves him not. No people, can claim him.
2. Pause after words in apposition and opposition.
EXAMPLES.
James, the clerk at Richmond's. Armington is wrong, not I.


## p. 16 (#20) ##############################################

16
ATWELL'S EPITOME OF ELOCUTION.
3. The words but, hence, standing at the beginning
of a sentence denoting transition, require a pause after
them.
EXAMPLE.
But, it remained for Charlie, to render the piece well.
4. The word that, when a conjunction or relative, the
adverbs when and whence used in the same sense, and
also the relative pronouns who, which, what, require a
pause before them.
Other instances might be named where pauses would
be useful; but it is unnecessary to multiply them.
Good judgment will guide one in their use, and inform
us when they will bring out the meaning of a passage.
INFLECTIONS.
Inflection is that movement of the voice which, by
rising or falling, or by the combination of the two move-
ments, making a circumflex, varies our style of address.
The fault of most speakers is the abuse of the monotone ;
by appropriate inflections it is avoided.
RULES FOR THE USE OF INFLECTIONS.
1. The rising inflection is proper when questions may
be answered by yes or no; also when there is doubt or
uncertainty the falling, when questions are asked ve-
hemently, or cannot be answered by yes or no.
EXAMPLES.
I
James, are you doing right?
am not.
James, are you doing right?

RULES AND EXERCISES.
17
EXCEPTION.
A request for the repetition of something not under-
stood, or a careless reply, has the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
like.
What did you say?
Do as you
2. Questions, words, and clauses connected by or, and
words and clauses contrasted, have the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
Will he go to town or remain at home? You can witness
often, the effects of love and hatred, joy and grief.
3. Or, used conjunctively, the rising inflection is re-
quired both before and after it, and also in case of
contrast, one side being affirmed and the other denied.
EXAMPLES.
not
Can wealth,
honor, or
My rule is not right,
yours.
4. Every complete sentence has the falling inflection.
EXAMPLES.
You are good.
You do him justice.
5. In the comparison and contrast of opposites, the
first has the rising and the second the falling; though
when one side of the contrast is affirmed and the other
denied, the latter has the rising. Also familiar address,
and when there is a pause denoting incompleteness.
EXAMPLES.

THE MONOTONE.
This regular movement of the voice, when judiciously
used, is very expressive, and indispensable. In the ren-
dering of solemn and sublime passages of poetry, it adds
wonderful force and dignity.
EXAMPLES.
"High on a throne of royal state, which far outshone the
wealth of Ormus or of Ind." 'Lord, thou hast been our
refuge from one generation to another," &c.


## p. 19 (#23) ##############################################

RULES AND EXERCISES.
19
SPECIAL RULE.
""
Suit the sound to the word. That is, do not, for
instance, in reading the sublime passage from St. Paul,
on the resurrection, "There is one glory of the sun, and
another of the moon, and another of the stars - pro-
nounce each of the emphatic words in the same tone, but
indicate you are speaking of the moon, of the sun, bright
and glorious, of the glittering stars.
EMPHASIS.
Emphasis is the stress which is given to a word or
words in a sentence, to distinguish them from the rest.
An excess of it must be avoided. As Cicero judiciously
observes, "A speaker must remit occasionally the vehe-
mence of his actions, and not utter every passage with all
the force of which he is capable: so as to set off the more
strongly the emphatical parts: as the painter makes the
figures stand out boldly by light and shades: there are
always strong points, as they may be called, in every writ
ten piece, which must always be attended to. These hills
and dales, mountains and precipices, cataract and gulf;
always keep some resources, and never utter the weaker
with all your energy; for if you do, there will be a fail-
ing in the strong points the most pathetic parts."
-
ABOUT APPLYING EMPHASIS.
1. Study faithfully what you would render, and dis-
cover the emphatic word, for there is always some
word or words of greater significance than the rest.


## p. 20 (#24) ##############################################

20
ATWELL'S EPITOME OF ELOCUTION.
EXAMPLE.
WHAT and WHENCE art thou?
2. Pause somewhat before and after the emphatic
word or words.
3. Keep under all other words in the sentence.
4. A repetition of emphatic words or phrases requires
an increased force of utterance.
EXAMPLE.
You ruined my son. You, sir!
5. In the climax there is a gradual increase of em-
phatic force to the end.
EXAMPLE.
Decline, change, and Loss. The forming hand, the tombs, the
very ASHES they contained, are ALL gone.
SPECIAL RULE.
In case of parenthesis, repetition, or explanation, the
subdued tones are invariably used.
MODULATION AND THE QUALITY OF
THE VOICE.
The modulation and tone of the voice are decided by
the style of the composition to be rendered. The narra-
tive, descriptive, serious, and passionate are all expressed
differently. In the absence of arbitrary rules, a supply
of common sense will teach the right expression of any
sentiment. Where the passions are much involved, to
render well, we must study nature. If we would as-
sume the character of Shylock, take as a model a penu-
rious, money-getting person of your acquaintance, and

imitate his manner-or to express sorrow correctly, study
the conduct of the parent at the grave of a child.
"The
ancient Grecian actor, Polus, who, when he had the part
of Electra to perform, and was to represent the princess
weeping over the ashes of her brother Orestes, ordered
the urn which contained the ashes of his dear and only
son to be brought upon the stage, and by this means
excited in himself the pitch of grief with which he
wished to affect his audience."
THE READING OF POETRY.
The rules which apply to the reading of prose may
likewise be used with propriety and effect with reference
to poetry. In the more difficult passages of poetry, the
proper reading is decided by transposition. In these
statements the majority of elocutionists agree.
FINALLY.
If a person expects to become a good elocutionist
without labor, he will be disappointed.. Practice, and
constant persevering practice, is the only certain path to
perfection in this branch of culture. Remember this,
and act accordingly.

REMARKS.
THIS work, compared with many, contains but few

SELECTIONS IN PROSE.
I. THE ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.
I CANNOT forbear regretting here, that a matter of such
vast importance to preaching, as delivery, should be so
generally neglected or misunderstood. A common appre-
hension prevails, indeed, that a strict regard to these
rules would be deemed theatrical; and the dread, per-
haps, of incurring this imputation, is a restraint upon
many. But is it not possible to obtain a just and ex-
pressive manner, perfectly consistent with the gravity of
the pulpit, and yet quite distinct from the more passionate,
strong, and diversified action of the theatre? And is it
not possible to hit off this manner so easily and naturally,
as to leave no room for just reflection? An affair this,
it must be owned, of the utmost delicacy; in which we
shall probably often miscarry, and meet with abundance
of censure at first. But still, I imagine, that through the
regulations of taste, the improvements of experience, the
corrections of friendship, the feelings of piety, and the

of elocution to take place, it is difficult to say how much
the preaching art would gain by it. Pronunciation would
be studied, an ear would be formed, the voice would be
modulated, every feature of the face, every motion of
the hands, every posture of the body, would be brought
under right management. A graceful, and correct, and
animated expression in all these would be ambitiously
sought after; mutual criticisms and friendly hints would
be universally acknowledged; light and direction would
be borrowed from every quarter, and from every age.
The best models of antiquity would in a particular man-
ner be admired, surveyed, and imitated. The sing-song
voice, and the see-saw gestures, if I may be allowed to
use those expressions, would, of course, be exploded;
and, in time, nothing would be admitted, at least ap-
proved, among performers, but what was decent, manly,
and truly excellent in the kind. Even the people them-
selves would contract, insensibly, a growing relish for
such a manner; and those preachers would at last be in
chief repute with all, who followed nature, overlooked
themselves, appeared totally absorbed in the subject, and
spoke with real propriety and pathos, from the immediate
impulse of truth and virtue.

II. THE OCEAN-ITS GRANDEUR AND SUBLIMITY.
THE most impressive exhibitions of power, known to
to our globe, belong to the ocean.
The volcano, with its ascending cloud of flame, and
and the earthquake, whose
falling torrents of liquid fire,
footstep is on the ruin of cities, are circumscribed in the
desolating range of their visitation. But the ocean, when
roused in its chainless strength, shakes a thousand shores
with storm and thunder.
―――――
-
-
Navies of oak and iron are tossed in mockery from its
crest, and whole armaments, manned by the strength and
courage of millions, perish among its bubbles.
The tempest on land is impeded by forests, and broken
by mountains; but on the plain of the deep it rushes
unresisted; and when its strength is at last spent, ten
thousand giant waves, which it has called up, still roll
its terrors onward.
-
The avalanche, shaken from its glittering steep, if it
rolls to the bosom of the earth, melts away and is lost
in vapor; but, if it plunge into the embrace of the ocean,
this mountain mass of ice and hail is borne about for
ages, in tumult and terror- the drifting monument of
the ocean's dead.
The mountain lake, and the meadow stream, are in-
habited only by the timid prey of the angler; but the
ocean is the home of the leviathan, his ways are in the
mighty deep. The glittering pebble, and the rainbow-
tinted shell, which the retiring tide has left upon the shore
as scarcely worthy of its care, and the watery gem,
which the pearl-diver reaches at the risk of his life,

are all that man can filch from the treasures of the sea.
The groves of coral which wave o'er its pavements, and
the halls of amber which glow in its depths, are beyond
his approach, save when he goes down amid the silent
magnificence to seek his burial monument!
The island, the continent, the capitols of kings, are
worn by time, washed away by the wave, consumed by
the flame, or sunk by the earthquake. But the ocean
still remains, and still rolls on, in the greatness of its
unabated strength; and over the majesty of its form,
and the marvels of its might, time and disaster have no
power.
Even the vast clouds of vapor, which rise up from its
bosom, roll away, to encircle the globe; and on distant
mountains and deserts pour out their watery treasures,
which gather themselves again, in streams and torrents,
and return with exulting bounds to their parent ocean.
These are the messengers which proclaim in every land
the exhaustless resources of the sea. But it is reserved
for "those who go down to the sea in ships, to see the
works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep."
Man, also, has made the ocean the theatre of his
power. The ship in which he rides that element, is
one of the highest triumphs of his skill. At first, this
floating fabric was only a frail bark, slowly urged by the
laboring oar. The sail at length arose, and spread its
wings to the wind. Still, when the lofty promontory had
sunk from sight, and the orbs.above him were lost in
clouds, he had no power to direct his course. But the
secret of the magnet is at length revealed to him; and
now, his needle settles to the polar star, with a fixedness
which love has stolen as the emblem of its constancy.

Now, however, he can dispense with sail, and oar, and
flowing wave. He constructs his engine, of flame and
vapor, and o'er the vast solitude of the sea, as o'er the
solid earth, goes thundering on his track.
On the ocean, too, thrones have been lost and won.
On the fate of Actium was suspended the empire of the
world. In the Gulf of Salamis the pride of Persia found
a grave, and the crescent set for ever in the waters of
Navarino. While at Trafalgar and the Nile, nations
held their breath, as each gun, from its adamantine lips,
spread a death-shade around the ships, like the hurricane
eclipse of the sun.

III. SINCERITY.
TRUTH and sincerity have all the advantages of ap-
pearance, and many more. If the show of anything be
good, I am sure the reality is better; for why does any
man dissemble, or seem to be that which he is not, but
because he thinks it good to have the qualities he pre-
tends to? Now, the best way for a man to seem to be
anything, is to be in reality what he would seem to be::
besides, it is often as troublesome to support the pre-
tence of a good quality, as to have it; and, if a man have
it not, it is most likely he will be discovered to want it;:
and then all his labor to seem to have it is lost. There
is something unnatural in painting, which a skilful eye
will easily discern from native beauty and complexion.
Therefore, if any man think it convenient to seem
-

good, let him be so indeed; and then his goodness will
appear to every one's satisfaction. Particularly, as to
the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages
over all the artificial modes of dissimulation and deceit.
It is much the plainer and easier - much the safer, and
more secure way of dealing in the world; it has less of
trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and perplexity, of
danger and hazard in it. The arts of deceit and cunning
continually grow weaker, and less serviceable to those
that practise them; whereas integrity gains strength by
use; and the more and longer any man practiseth it, the
greater service it does him, by confirming his reputation,
and encouraging those with whom he hath to do, to re-
pose the greatest confidence in him; which is an un-
speakable advantage in business and the affairs of life.
But insincerity is very troublesome to manage. A
hypocrite hath so many things to attend to, as make his
life a very perplexed and intricate thing. A liar hath
need of a good memory, lest he contradict at one time
what he said at another; but truth is always consistent,
and needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at
hand, and sits upon our lips; whereas a lie is trouble-
some, and needs a great many more to make it good.
In a word, whatsoever convenience may be thought to
be in falsehood or dissimulation, it is soon over; but the
inconvenience of it is perpetual; because it brings a man
under an everlasting jealousy and suspicion; so that he
is not believed when he speaks the truth; nor trusted
when, perhaps, he means honestly. When a man hath
once forfeited the reputation of his integrity, nothing then
will serve his turn; neither truth nor falsehood.
Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for a

day, and should never have occasion to conversc more
with mankind, it were then no great matter (as far as
respects the affairs of the world) if he spent his reputa-
tion all at once; or ventured it at one throw. But if he
be to continue in the world, and would have the advan-
tage of reputation while he is in it, let him make use
of truth and sincerity in all his words and actions; for
nothing but this will hold out to the end. All other
arts may fail; but truth and integrity will carry a man
through, and bear him out to the last.
IV. A REFLECTION.
TILLOTSON.
WHEN I look upon the tombs of the great, every emo-
tion dies within me; when I read the epitaphs of the
beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet
with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart
melts with compassion; when I see the tomb of the
parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grief for
those whom we must quickly follow. When I see kings
lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival
wits placed side by side, or the holy men that divided the
world with their contentions and disputes, I reflect with
sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions, fac-
tions, and debates of mankind. When I read the several
dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday, and some
six hundred years ago, I consider that great day when
we shall all of us be contemporaries, and make an ap-
pearance together.

V. CRIME ITS OWN DETECTOR.
AGAINST the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I
cannot have the slightest prejudice. I would not do him
the smallest injury or injustice. But I do not affect to be
indifferent to the discovery and the punishment of this
deep guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how
much soever it may be, which is cast on those who feel
and manifest an anxious concern that all who had a part
in planning, or a hand in executing, this deed of midnight
assassination, may be brought to answer for their enor
mous crime at the bar of public justice.
Gentlemen, this is a most extraordinary case. In some
respects it has hardly a precedent anywhere-certainly
none in our New England history. An aged man, with-
out an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in his
own bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder, for
mere pay. Deep sleep had fallen on the destined victim,
and on all beneath his roof. A healthful old man, to
whom sleep was sweet- the first sound slumbers of the
night hold him in their soft but strong embrace.
――――――
The assassin enters through the window, already pre-
pared, into an unoccupied apartment; with noiseless foot
he paces the lonely hall, half lighted by the moon; he
winds up the ascent of the stairs, and reaches the door
of the chamber. Of this he moves the lock, by soft and
continued pressure, till it turns on its hinges; and he
enters and beholds his victim before him. The room was
uncommonly light. The face of the innocent sleeper was
turned from the murderer; and the beams of the moon,

3333
resting on the gray locks of his aged temple, showed him
where to strike. The fatal blow is given, and the victim
passes, without a struggle or a motion, from the repose of
sleep to the repose of death! It is the assassin's purpose
to make sure work; and he yet plies the dagger, though
it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow of
the bludgeon. IIe even raises the aged arm, that he may
not fail in his aim at the heart, and replaces it again over
the wounds of the poniard! To finish the picture, he
explores the wrist for the pulse! he feels it, and ascer-
tains that it beats no longer! It is accomplished! the
deed is done! IIe retreats- retraces his steps to the
window, passes through as he came in, and escapes.
He has done the murder; no eye has seen him, no ear
has heard him; the secret is his own, and he is safe!
Ah! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a
secret can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of God
has neither nook nor corner, where the guilty can bestow
it and say it is safe. Not to speak of that Eye which
glances through all disguises, and beholds everything as
in the splendor of noon, such secrets of guilt are never
safe;
"murder will out." True it is that Providence
hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that those
who break the great law of Heaven, by shedding man's
blood, seldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially
in a case exciting so much attention as this, discovery
must and will come, sooner or later. A thousand eyes
turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every
circumstance, connected with the time and place; a
thousand cars catch every whisper; a thousand excited
minds intently dwell on the scene; shedding all their
light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance

into a blaze of discovery. Meantime the guilty soul can-
not keep its own secret. It is false to itself- or rather
it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to
itself it labors under its guilty possession, and knows
not what to do with it. The human heart was not made
for the residence of such an inhabitant; it finds itself
preyed on by a torment which it dares not acknowledge
to God or man. A vulture is devouring it, and it asks
no sympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth.
The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to
possess him; and like the evil spirits of which we read,
it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will.
He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and
demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world sees
it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost hears its
workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has be-
come his master; -it betrays his discretion; it breaks
down his courage; it conquers his prudence. When
suspicions, from without, begin to embarrass him, and
the net of circumstances to entangle him, the fatal secret
struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It
must be confessed; it will be confessed; there is no
refuge from confession but in suicide, and suicide is con-
fession.

constructed telescope to the heavens, he saw fulfilled the
grand prophecy of Copernicus, and beheld the planet
Venus crescent like the moon.
It was such another moment as that, when the immor-
tal printers of Mentz and Strasburg received the first
copy of the Bible into their hands, the work of their
divine art; like that, when Columbus, through the gray
dawn of the 12th of October, 1492, beheld the shores of
San Salvador; like that, when the law of gravitation
first revealed itself to the intellect of Newton; like that,
when Franklin saw, by the stiffening fibres of the hempen
cord of his kite, that he held the lightning in his grasp;
like that, when Leverrier received back from Berlin the
tidings that the predicted planet was found.
Yes, noble Galileo, thou art right. "It DOES move."
Bigots may make thee recant it, but it moves, neverthe-
less. Yes, the earth moves, and the planets move, and
the mighty waters move, and the great sweeping tides
of air move, and the empires of men move, and the
world of thought moves, ever onward and upward, to
higher facts and bolder theories. The Inquisition may
seal thy lips, but they can no more stop the progress of
the great truth propounded by Copernicus, and demon-
strated by thee, than they can stop the revolving earth.
Close, now, venerable sage, that sightless, tearful eye;
it has seen what man never before saw; it has seen
enough. Hang up that poor little spy-glass; it has done
its work. Not Herschel nor Rosse has, comparatively,
done more. Franciscans and Dominicans deride thy
discoveries now, but the time will come when, from two
hundred observatories in Europe and America, the glori-
ous artillery of science shall nightly assault the skies;

but they shall gain no conquests in those glittering fields
before which thine shall be forgotten.
Rest in peace, great Columbus of the heavens; like
him, scorned, persecuted, broken-hearted!-in other

ence, with solemn acts of consceration, shall dedicate
their stately edifices to the cause of knowledge and truth,
thy name shall be mentioned with honor.

and when, at noon, I gathered the sheep beneath the

We led our flocks to the same pasture, and partook to-

which shaded our cottage, my grandsire, an old man,

ancient times, a little band of Spartans, in a def of the
mountains, had withstood a whole army. I did not then
know what war was; but my cheeks burned, I knew not
why, and I clasped the knees of that venerable man,

hoof of the war-horse, the bleeding body of my father
flung amidst the blazing rafters of our dwelling! To-
day I killed a man in the arena; and, when I broke his
hemlet-clasps, behold, he was my friend. He knew me,
smiled faintly, gasped, and died;—the same sweet smile
upon his lips that I had marked, when, in adventurous
boyhood, we scaled the lofty cliff to pluck the first ripe
grapes, and bear them home in childish triumph! I
told the prætor that the dead man had been my friend,
generous and brave; and I begged that I might bear
away the body, to burn it on a funeral pile, and mouru
over its ashes. Ay! upon my knees, amid the dust and
blood of the arena, I begged that poor boon, while all
the assembled maids and matrons, and the holy virgins
they call Vestals, and the rabble, shouted in derision,
deeming it rare sport, forsooth, to see Rome's fiercest
gladiator turn pale and tremble at sight of that piece
of bleeding clay! And the prætor drew back as I were
pollution, and sternly said, "Let the carrion rot; there
are no noble men but Romans." And so, fellow-gladia-

Rome! thou hast been a tender nurse to me.
Ay! thou
hast given to that poor, gentle, timid shepherd lad, who
never knew a harsher tone than a flute-note, muscles of
iron and a heart of flint; taught him to drive the sword
through plaited mail and links of rugged brass, and
warm it in the marrow of his foe; — to gaze into the
glaring eyeballs of the fierce Numidian lion, even as a
boy upon a laughing girl! And, he shall pay thee back,
until the yellow Tiber is red as frothing wine, and in its
deepest ooze thy life-blood lies curdled!

Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are! The
strength of brass is in your toughened sinews; but to-
morrow some Roman Adonis, breathing sweet perfume
from his curly locks, shall with his lily fingers pat your
red brawn, and bet his sesterces upon your blood.
Hark! hear ye yon lion roaring in his den? "Tis three
days since he has tasted flesh; but to-morrow he shall
break his fast upon yours, - and a dainty meal for him
ye will be!
If ye are beasts, then stand here, like fat
oxen, waiting for the butcher's knife! If ye are men,
follow me! Strike down yon guard, gain the mountain
passes, and then do bloody work, as did your sires at old
Thermopyla! Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian
spirit frozen in your veins, that you do crouch and cower
like a belabored hound beneath his master's lash? O,
comrades! warriors! Thracians! if we must fight, let
us fight for ourselves! If we must slaughter, let us
slaughter our oppressors! If we must die, let it be
under the clear sky, by the bright waters, in noble, hon-

SPEAK the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it,
as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier
spake my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with
your hand thus, but use all gently; for in the very tor-
rent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your
passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that
may give it smoothness. Oh! it offends me to the soul,
to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion
to tatters, to very rags, - to split the ears of the
groundlings; who, for the most part, are capable of
nothing but inexplicable dumb show and noise. I would
have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant: it
out-herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.

Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor. Suit the action to the word; the word to
the action; with this special observance - that
you o'er-
step not the modesty of nature: for anything so over-
done is from the purpose of playing; whose end, both at
the first and now, was, and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature ; to show virtue her own feature;
scorn her own image; and the very age and body of the
time, his form and pressure. Now this, overdone or
come tardy off, though it make the unskillful laugh, can-
not but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which
one, must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre
of others. Oh! there be players, that I have seen play,
and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it

DEEP in the wave is a coral grove,
Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove,
Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue
That never are wet with the falling dew,
But in bright and changeful beauty shine,
Far down in the green and glassy brine.
The floor is of sand like the mountain's drift,
And the pearl-shells spangle the flinty snow;
From coral rocks the sea-plants lift
Their boughs where the tides and billows flow.
The water is calm and still below,
For the winds and waves are absent there,
And the sands are bright as the stars that glow
In the motionless fields of upper air;
There, with its waving blade of green,
The sea-flag streams through the silent water,
And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen
To blush like a banner bathed in slaughter..
There, with a light and easy motion,
The fan-coral sweeps through the clear deep sea;
And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean
Are bending like corn on the upland lea.

And is safe, where the wrathful spirit of storms

Where the myriad voices of ocean roar,
When the wind-god frowns in the murky skies,
And demons are waiting the wreck on the shore,
Then, far below, in the peaceful sea,
The purple mullet and gold-fish rove:
There the waters murmur tranquilly
Through the bending twigs of the coral grove.

In shadowy dimness, silent and sublime,
Through bending clouds of glory and of gloom.

Domes, minarets, and towers
Of Nature's own contriving; and soft bowers
of interwoven branches, vines, and flowers,
Through which trip lightly the impassioned Hours.
I hear the gushing melody of birds,
The dash of dancing waters, and the deep,
Low murmurs of the winds, that creep
Into my soul, like music without words;
I stand in Paradise!

And lo! two beings, young, and beautiful
Beyond the poet's most enraptured dream,
Glide through the mazes: resting now to cull
Sweet tinted flowers that fringe a silver stream,
Or clustering fruits that in the sunlight gleam;
And all the while their voices fill the air
With swelling anthems to the Great Supreme,
And all the while, in peace, they wander there,
God-loving and beloved, without or grief or care.
The charm is broken! from a distant hill,
I see the Serpent take his subtle way,
To where, all dreamless of the coming ill,
The doomed pair in happy converse stray;
And now, with secret art, he holds his prey,
And now enfolds them like a tongue of flame;
With charméd words he leadeth them astray,
Till, all forgetful of the Master's claim,
They do the deed of sin, and hide themselves in shame.
I read, in holy verse,
Their everlasting curse!
"Thou shalt bring forth in pain,
And live in sorrow, and toil in vain,
And thistles reap, and thorns, instead of grain,
And down thy brow shall sweat-drops roll like rain."
That curse has had no death; we are brought forth in
pain,
And all the pathway of our checkered years
Is strewn with ashes and remorseful tears,
Till, in the midst of grief, we yield our breath again.

Joy lives always in to-morrow!

Sweet phantoms rise, to cheer our bleak existence,
And lure us onward with uplifted hands;
We follow, and they fade into the distance,
As fades the mirage upon desert sands.
What boots it, that the earth makes show of joy?
That roses bloom, and trees grow green in spring,
That the soft grass springs up without annoy,
That skies are blue, and birds forever sing?
There are more weeds than flowers,
More sad than sunny hours!
And though the leaves be musical,
They all must wither soon, and fall!
And though the green grass waves,
Down under it are graves!.
And, alas! they have no souls,
Those little birds, whose melody so rolls.
What boots it, that we ring the merry laugh,
Sing the song, and crack the jest?
That we seek love, deem kisses more than chaff,
Or hold pleasure worth the quest?
And what boots it, that some glide
Through the world with little care?
And what boots it, that the bride
Is so jubilant and fair?

The pleasures that we follow,
Like our laugh, is hollow, hollow
As a bell
That now rings us to a wedding, with a chime;
And now buries us in sorrow for a time,
With a knell !
And the jest seldom slips,
But it strikes a tender chord!
And a kiss was on the lips
Of the wretch who sold his Lord!
Do you sing?—the sweetest songs
Tell of sorrows and of wrongs.
Do you love? - perfect love
Only lives in realms above,
And the careless are the light,
Light of heart and light of head:
And ye robe the bride in white,

UPON a rock that, high and sheer,
Rose from the mountain's breast
A
weary hunter of the deer
Had sat him down to rest,
And bared, to the soft, summer air,
His hot red brow and sweaty hair.

All dim in haze the mountains lay,
With dimmer vales between,
And rivers glimmered on their way
By forests, faintly seen;
While ever rose a murmuring sound
From brooks below and bees around.
He listened, till he seemed to hear
A voice so soft and low,
That whether in the mind or ear,
The listener scarce might know;
With such a tone, so sweet and mild,
The watching mother lulls her child.
-
"Thou weary huntsman,”—thus it said, -
"Though faint with toil and heat!
The pleasant land of rest is spread
Before thy very feet;
And those whom thou would gladly see
Are waiting there to welcome thee."
He looked, and 'twixt the earth and sky,
Amidst the noontide haze,
A shadowy region met his eye,
And
beneath his gaze,
grew
As if the vapors of the air
Had gathered into shapes so fair.
Groves freshened as he looked, and flowers
Showed bright on rocky bank,
And fountains welled beneath the bowers,
Where deer and pheasant drank.
He saw the glittering streams; he heard
The rustling bough and twittering bird.

There lived, and walked again;
And there was one who many a year
Within her grave had lain
A fair young girl, the region's pride :
His heart was breaking when she died.

Bounding as was her wont, she came
Right toward his resting-place,
And stretched her hand, and called his name,
With sweet and smiling face:
Forward, with fixed and eager eyes,
The hunter leaned in act to rise.
Forward he leaned, and headlong down
Plunged from that craggy wall;
He saw the rocks, steep, stern, and brown,
An instant, in his fall-

A fearful instant, and no more:
The dream and life at once were o'er.

We'd jump the life to come. But, in these cases,
We still have judgment here, that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, -
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meck, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And Pity, like a naked, new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubims
Horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,
And falls on the other side.

'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
Ilis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute of awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above the sceptred sway;
It is cuthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice: therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this-
That in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation. No, we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy; I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea.

Give them stout hearts, ye gods! to enable them
To stand the flashing of their tyrants' swords;
Deaf to the din of battle let them be;

Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language: for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And gentle sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
When thoughts
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart, —
Go forth under the open sky, and list
To Nature's teachings, while from all around
-
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air
Comes a still voice-Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more

Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements;
To be a brother to the insensible rock,
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
Yet not to thy eternal resting-place

Shalt thou retire alone. nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world with kings,
The powerful of the earth the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills,
Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks,
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,-

Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there!
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep-the dead reign there alone!
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou shalt fall
Unnoticed by the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The bowed with age, the infant in the smiles
And beauty of its innocent age cut off-
Shall, one by one, be gathered to thy side,
By those who in their turn shall follow them.

So live, that when thy summons comes, to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
-
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

VIII. MARCO BOZZARIS.
AT midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power:
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams, his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring;
Then pressed that monarch's throne a king:
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.
――――
At midnight, in the forest shades,
Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,
True as the steel of their tried blades,
Heroes in heart and hand.
There had the Persian's thousands stood,
There had the glad earth drunk their blood,
On old Platea's day;
And now there breathed that haunted air
The sons of sires who conquered there,
With arm to strike, and soul to dare,
As quick, as far as they.
――――――
An hour passed on the Turk awoke :
That bright dream was his last;
He woke to hear his sentries shriek,
"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek ! ”
¦

He woke to die 'midst flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast
As lightnings from the mountain cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band:
―――――――――
"Strike till the last armed foe expires;
for your altars and your fires;
for the green graves of your sires;
God—and your native land!"
Strike
Strike
-
-
They fought like brave men, long and well;
They piled that ground with Moslem slain;
They conquered — but Bozzaris fell,
--
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
His smile, when rang their proud huzza,
And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, death!
Come to the mother's, when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wait its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form;
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet-song, and dance, and wine;

And thou art terrible. The tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.
Bozzaris! with the storied brave
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,
Rest thee- there is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.
We tell thy doom without a sigh ;-
For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's;
One of the few, the immortal names,
That were not born to die.

IX. THE SAILOR BOY'S DREAM.
IN slumbers of midnight the sailor-boy lay,
His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind;
But, watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,
And visions of happiness danced o'er his mind.
He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,
And pleasures that waited on life's merry morn;
While Memory stood sidewise, half covered with flowers,
And restored every rose, but secreted its thorn.

Then Fancy, her magical pinions spread wide,
And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise:
Now far, far behind him the green waters glide,
And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.
The jessamine clambers in flowers o'er the thatch,
And the swallow sings sweet from her nest in the wall;
All trembling with transport, he raises the latch,
And the voices of loved ones reply to his call.
A father bends o'er him with looks of delight,
His cheek is impearled with a mother's warm tear;
And the lips of the boy in a love-kiss unite
With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.
The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;
Joy quickens his pulse-all hardships seem o'er;
And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest:
"Kind Fate, thou hast blessed me; I ask for no more."
Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye?
Ah! what is that sound which now. larums his ear?
'Tis the lightning's red glare, painting hell on the sky!
'Tis the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!
He springs from his hammock - he flies to the deck·
Amazement confronts him with images dire
Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel awreck
The masts fly in splinters the shrouds are on fire!
Like mountains the billows tremendously swell
In vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;
Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,
And the death-angel flaps his broad wing o'er the wave!

O sailor-boy! woe to thy dream of delight!
In darkness dissolves the gay frost-work of bliss;
Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,
Thy parents' fond pressure, and love's honeyed kiss?
O sailor-boy! sailor-boy! never again
Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay;
Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,
Full many a score fathom, thy frame shall decay.
No tomb shall e'er plead to remembrance for thee,
Or redeem form or frame from the merciless surge;
But the white foam of waves shall thy winding-sheet be,
And winds, in the midnight of winter, thy dirge!
On beds of green sea-flowers thy limbs shall be laid;
Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;
Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made;
And every part suit to thy mansion below.
Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,
And still the vast waters above thee shall roll:
Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye:
O sailor-boy! sailor-boy! peace to thy soul!

OFT has it been my lot to mark
A proud, conceited, talking spark,
With eyes that hardly served at most
To guard their master 'gainst a post;
Yet round the world the blade has been,
To see whatever could be seen.
Returning from his finished tour,
Grown ten times perter than before,
Whatever word you chance to drop,
The travelled fool your mouth will stop:
"Sir, if my judgment you'll allow-
I've seen
and sure I ought to know'
So begs you'd pay a due submission,
And acquiesce in his decision.

Discoursed a while, 'mongst other matter,
Of the chameleon's form and nature.
"A stranger animal," cries one,
"Sure never lived beneath the sun:
A lizard's body, lean and long,
A fish's head, a serpent's tongue;
Its foot with triple claw disjoined,
And what a length of tail behind!
How slow its pace! and then its hue
Who ever saw so fine a blue?"
-
"Hold, there," the other quick replies,
-I saw it with these eyes,
―
""Tis green
As late with open mouth it lay,
And warmed it in the sunny ray;
Stretched at its ease the beast I viewed,
And saw it eat the air for food."
"I've seen it, sir, as well as you,
And must again affirm it blue:
At leisure I the beast surveyed
Extended in the cooling shade."
""Tis green, 'tis green, sir, I assure ye!”
"Green!" cries the other in a fury;
"Why, sir, d'ye think I've lost my eyes?"
"Twere no great loss," the friend replies;
"For, if they always serve you thus,
You'll find them but of little use."
So high at last the contest rose,
From words they almost came to blows;
When luckily came by a third:
To him the question they referred,

And begged he'd tell them, if he knew,
Whether the thing was green.or blue.
"Sir," cries the umpire, 66 cease your pother;
The creature's neither one nor t'other;
I caught the animal last night,
And viewed it o'er by candle-light:
-
I marked it well-'twas black as jet:
You stare - but, sirs, I've got it yet,
And can produce it." "Pray, sir, do;
I'll lay my life the thing is blue."
"And I'll be sworn, that when you've seen
The reptile, you'll pronounce him green."
"Well, then, at once to ease the doubt,"
Replies the man, "I'll turn him out;
And when before your eyes I've set him,
If you don't find him black, I'll eat him."
He said, then full before their sight
Produced the beast, and lo! 'twas white!
Both stared; the man looked wondrous wise:
"My children," the chameleon cries
(Then first the creature found a tongue),
"You all are right, and all are wrong:
When next you talk of what you view,
Think others see as well as you;
Nor wonder if you find that none
Prefers your eyesight to his own."

XII. THE THREE WARNINGS.
THE tree of deepest root is found
Least willing still to quit the ground;
'Twas therefore said by ancient sages,
That love of life increased with years
So much, that in our later stages,
When pains grow sharp and sickness rages,
The greatest love of life appears.
This strange affection to believe,
Which all confess, but few perceive,
If old assertion can't prevail,
Be pleased to hear a modern tale:
When sports went round, and all were gay,
On neighbor Dobson's wedding-day,
Death called aside the jocund groom
With him into another room;
"9
And looking grave, "You must," says he,
"Quit your sweet bride, and come with me.'
"With you, and quit my Susan's side!
With you!" the hapless husband cried;
"Young as I am! 'tis monstrous hard!
Besides, in truth, I'm not prepared :
My thoughts on other matters go;
This is my wedding-night, you know.”
What more he urged I have not heard;
His reasons could not well be stronger:
So Death the poor delinquent spared,
And left to live a little longer.

Yet, calling up a serious look,
His hour-glass trembled while he spoke,
66 Neighbor," he said, "farewell: no more
Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour:
And further, to avoid all blame
Of cruelty upon my name,
To give you time for preparation,
And fit you for your future station,
Three several warnings you shall have,
Before you're summoned to the grave:
Willing for once, I'll quit my prey,

And grant a kind reprieve,
In hopes you'll have no more to say,
But, when I call again this way,
Well pleased the world will leave."
To these conditions both consented,
And parted perfectly contented.

What next the hero of our tale befell,
How long he lived, how wise, how well,
How roundly he pursued his course,
And smoked his pipe, and stroked his horse,
The willing muse shall tell :
He chaffered then, he bought, he sold,
Nor once perceived his growing old,
Nor thought of death as near;
His friends not false, his wife no shrew,
Many his gains, his children few,
He passed his hours in peace;
But while he viewed his wealth increase,
While thus along life's dusty road
The beaten track content he trod,

Old Time, whose haste no mortal spares,
Uncalled, unheeded, unawares,
Brought on his eightieth year.
And now, one night, in musing mood,
As all alone he sate,
Th' unwelcome messenger of Fate
Once more before him stood.
Half killed with anger and surprise,
"So soon returned!" old Dobson cries.
"So soon, d'ye call it?" Death replies:
"Surely, my friend, you're but in jest;
Since I was here before
"Tis six and thirty years at least,
And you are now fourscore."
"So much the worse," the clown rejoined;
"To spare the aged would be kind :
Besides, you promised me three warnings,
Which I have looked for nights and mornings:
But, for that loss of time and ease,
I can recover damages."
"I know," cries Death, "that, at the best,
I seldom am a welcome guest.
But don't be captious, friend, at least;
I little thought you'd still be able
To stump about your farm and stable;
Your years have run to a great length;
I wish you joy, though, of your strength."
"Hold," says the farmer, "not so fast;
I have been lame these four years past."
"And no great wonder," Death replies;
"However, you still keep your eyes;

And sure to see one's loves and friends
For legs and arms would make amends."
"Perhaps," says Dobson, "so it might,
But latterly I've lost my sight."
"This is a shocking story, faith;
Yet there's some comfort still," says Death:
"Each strives your sadness to amuse;
I warrant you hear all the news."
"There's none," cries he; "and, if there were,
I'm grown so deaf I could not hear."
"Nay, then," the spectre stern rejoined,
“These are unjustifiable yearnings;
If you are lame, and deaf, and blind,
You've had your three sufficient warnings.
So come along; no more we'll part."
He said, and touched him with his dart:
And now old Dobson, turning pale,
Yields to his fate. so ends my tale.

Was fastened on a copy-book,

When suddenly, behind his back,
Rose sharp and clear a rousing smack!
As 'twere a battery of bliss
Let off in one tremendous kiss!
"What's that?" the startled master cries,
"That, thir," a little imp replies,
"Wath William Willith, if you pleathe:
I thaw him kith Thuthannah Peathe!"
With frown to make a statue thrill
The master thundered, "Hither, Will!"
Like wretch o'ertaken in his track
With stolen chattels on his back,
Will hung his head in fear and shame,
And to the awful presence came,
A great, green, bashful simpleton,
The butt of all good-natured fun.
With smile suppressed and birch upraised,
The threatener faltered, "I'm amazed
-
That you, my biggest pupil, should
Be guilty of an act so rude!
Before the whole set school, to boot!
What evil genius put you to't?"
""Twas she herself, sir," sobbed the lad;
"I did not mean to be so bad;
But when Susannah shook her curls,
And whispered I was 'fraid of girls,
And dursn't kiss a baby's doll,
I couldn't stand it, sir, at all,
But up and kissed her on the spot!

But, somehow, from her looks — boo-hoo -
I thought she kind o' wished me to!"

The truth is, sir, now I reflect,
I've been so sadly given to grog,
I wonder I've not lost the respect
(Here's to you, sir!) even of my dog.
But he sticks by through thick and thin;
And this old coat, with its empty pockets,
And rags that smell of tobacco and gin,
He'll follow while he has eyes in his sockets.
We'll have some music, if you're willing,
And Roger (hem! what a plague a cough is, sir!)
Shall march a little. Start, you villain!
Stand straight! 'Bout face! Salute your officer !

To aid a poor old patriot soldier.

I'd sell out heaven for something warm
To prop a horrible inward sinking.
Is there a way to forget to think?
At your age, sir, home, fortune, friends,
A dear girl's love; but I took to drink :
The same old story; you know how it ends.
If you could have seen these classic features, -
You needn't laugh, sir; they were not then
Such a burning libel on God's creatures:
I was one of your handsome men!
If you had seen her, so fair and young,
Whose head was happy on this breast!
If you could have heard the songs I sung
When the wine went round, you wouldn't have guessed
That ever I, sir, should be straying
From door to door, with fiddle and dog,
Ragged and penniless, and playing
To you to-night for a glass of grog!
She's married since,
a parson's wife :
'Twas better for her that we should part, -
Better the soberest, prosiest life
―――
Than a blasted home and a broken heart.
I have seen her? Once: I was weak and spent
On the dusty road; a carriage stopped:
But she little dreamed, as on she went,
Who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped!
-
You've set me talking, sir; I'm sorry;
It makes me wild to think of the change!
What do you care for a beggar's story?
Is it amusing? you find it strange?

This pain; then Roger and I will start.
I wonder has he such a lumpish, leaden,

He is sad sometimes, and would weep if he could,
No doubt, remembering things that were,-
A virtuous kennel, with plenty of food,
And himself a sober, respectable cur.

For supper and bed, or starve in the street.

XV. THE RAZOR-SELLER.
-
TROWBRIDGE.
A FELLOW, in a market-town,
Most musical, cried razors, up and down,
And offered twelve for eighteen pence;
Which certainly seemed wondrous cheap,
And, for the money, quite a heap,
That every man would buy with cash and sense.

A country bumpkin the great offer heard;
Poor Hodge, who suffered by a broad, black beard,
That seemed a shoe-brush, stuck beneath his nose.
With cheerfulness the eighteen pence he paid,
And proudly to himself in whispers said,
"This rascal stole the razors, I suppose.
"No matter if the fellow be a knave,
Provided that the razors shave;
It certainly will be a monstrous prize."
So home the clown with his good fortune went,
Smiling, in heart and soul content,
And quickly soaped himself to ears and eyes.
Being well lathered from a dish or tub,
Hodge now began, with grinning pain, to grub,
Just like a hedger cutting furze :
'Twas a vile razor! then the rest he tried;
All were impostors. "Ah!" Hodge sighed,
"I wish my eighteen pence was in my purse."
In vain, to chase his beard and bring the graces,
He cut, and dug, and whined, and stamped, and swore,
Brought blood and danced, blasphemed and made wry faces,
And cursed each razor's body o'er and o'er.
His muzzle, formed of opposition stuff,
Firm as a Foxite, would not lose its ruff;
So kept it, laughing at the steel and suds.
Hodge, in a passion, stretched his angry jaws,
Vowing the direst vengeance, with clenched claws,
On the vile cheat that sold the goods.
"Razors a vile, confounded dog!
Not fit to scrape a hog!"

Hodge sought the fellow, found him, and begun :
"P'rhaps, Master Razor-rogue! to you 'tis fun
That people flay themselves out of their lives.
You rascal! for an hour have I been grubbing,
Giving my crying whiskers here a scrubbing
With razors just like oyster knives.
Sirrah! I tell you, you're a knave
To cry up razors that can't shave."
"Friend," quoth the razor-man, "I'm not a knave.
As for the razors you have bought,
Upon my soul, I never thought
That they would shave!"
"Not think they'd shave!" quoth Hodge, with wondering
eyes,
And voice not much unlike an Indian yell;
"What were they made for, then, you dog?" he cries.
"Made?" quoth the fellow, with a smile- ." to sell."

Of all the time thou'st shot away,

And it shall be too hard a task to do.
Besides repentance, what canst find

REASONS FOR HUMILITY.
ONE part, one little part, we dimly scan,
Through the dark medium of life's feverish dream,
Yet dare arraign the whole stupendous plan,
If but that little part incongruous seem;
Nor is that part, perhaps, what mortals deem.
Oft from apparent ill our blessings rise:
O, then renounce that impious self-esteem
That aims to trace the secrets of the skies;
For thou art but of dust. Be humble and be wise.

THE one with yawning made reply:
"What have we seen? Not much have I !
Trees, meadows, mountains, groves, and streams,
Blue sky and clouds, and sunny gleams."

But with face transfigured and eye of flame:
"Trees, meadows, mountains, groves, and streams!
Blue sky and clouds, and sunny gleams!"

HAMLET TO HIS MOTHER.
Look here, upon this picture, and on this;
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See what a grace was seated on this brow:
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An
eye like Mars', to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury,
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination, and a form, indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
This was your husband. Look you, now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildewed ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love, for at your age
The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
Would step from this to this?

Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death

Charge for the guns!" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
"Forward, the Light Brigade!"

Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die,
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

Volleyed and thundered;

Boldly they rode and well;

Flashed all these sabres bare,
Flashed as they turned in air,
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wondered.
Plunged in the battery smoke,
Right through the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reeled from the sabre stroke
Shattered and sundered.

Not the six hundred.

The mind's pure ore and essence! O, that mind-
That mind of man! that godlike spring of action!
That source whence learning, virtue, honor, flow!
Which lifts us to the stars; which carries us
O'er the swollen waters of the angry deep,
As swallows skim the air! Thou, fame's sole fountain,

When the vile trunk is rotten. Give me this
O, give me but to live in after age
Remembered and unsullied! Heaven and earth!

Out of the clover and blue-eyed grass,
IIe turned them into the river-lane ;
One after another he let them pass,
Then fastened the meadow bars again.
Under the willows and over the hill,
He patiently followed their sober pace;
The merry whistle for once was still,
And something shadowed the sunny face.
Only a boy! and his father had said
He never could let his youngest go:
Two already were lying dead
Under the feet of the trampling foe.
But after the evening work was done,
And the frogs were loud in the meadow-swamp,
Over his shoulder he slung his gun,
And stealthily followed the foot-path damp,-

Across the clover and through the wheat,
With resolute heart and purpose grim,
Though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet,
And the blind bats flitting startled him.
Thrice since then had the lanes been white,
And the orchards sweet with apple-bloom;
And now,
when the cows came back at night,
The feeble father drove them home.
For news had come to the lonely farm
That three were lying where two had lain,
And the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
Could never lean on a son's again.
The summer day grew cool and late;
He went for the cows when the work was done ;
But down the lane, as he opened the gate,
He saw them coming, one by one,
-
Brindle, Ebony, Speckle, and Bess,
Shaking their horns in the evening wind,
Cropping the buttercups out of the grass;
But who was it following close behind?
Loosely swang in the idle air
The empty sleeve of warrior true ;
And worn and pale, from the crisping hair,
Looked out a face that the father knew;
For gloomy prisons will sometimes yawn,
And yield their dead unto life again;
And that day that comes with a cloudy dawn
In golden glory at last may wane.

Duke. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
Jaq. But for the seventh cause: how did you find
the quarrel upon the seventh cause?
Touch. Upon a lie seven times removed; as thus, sir:
I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard; he sent
me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in
the mind it was: this is called the Retort courteous. If
I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would
send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called
the Quip modest. If, again, it was not well cut, he dis-
abled my judgment: this is called the Reply churlish.
If, again, it was not well cut, he would answer, I spake
not true: this is called the Reproof valiant. If, again,
it was not well cut, he would say, I lie: this is called the
Countercheck quarrelsome; and so to the Lie circum-
stantial, and the Lie direct.
Jaq. And how oft did you say his beard was not
well cut?
Touch. I durst go no farther than the Lie circum-
stantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie direct; and so
we measured swords and parted.
Jaq. Can you nominate in order, now, the degrees
of the lie?
―
Touch. O, sir, we quarrel in print, by the book;
as you have books for good manners. I will name you
the degrees. The first, the Retort courteous; the second,
the Quip modest; the third, the Reply churlish; the
fourth, the Reproof valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck
quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with circumstance;
the seventh, the Lie direct. All these you may avoid

but the Lie direct; and you may avoid that, too, with an
If. I knew when seven justices could not make up a
quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one
of them thought but of an If, as, "If you said so, then
I said so;" and they shook hands, and were sworn
brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much vir-

III. MR. PICKWICK'S ROMANTIC ADVENTURE
WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS.
"DEAR me, it's time to go to bed. It will never do,
sitting here. I shall be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pick-
wick!"
At the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Mag-
nus rang the bell for the chamber-maid; and the striped
bag, the red bag, the leather hat-box, and the brown-
paper parcel, having been conveyed to his bed-room, he
retired in company with a japanned candlestick to one
side of the house, while Mr. Pickwick, and another
japanned candlestick, were conducted through a multi-
tude of tortuous windings to another.
"This is your room, Sir," said the chamber-maid.
"Very well," replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him.
It was a tolerably large, double-bedded room, with a fire;
upon the whole, a more comfortable-looking apartment
than Mr. Pickwick's short experience of the accomoda.
tions of the Great White Horse had led him to expect.
"Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course," said Mr.
Pickwick.
"O, no, Sir."
"Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some
hot water at half past eight in the morning, and that I
shall not want him any more to-night."
"Yes, Sir." And bidding Mr. Pickwick good night,
the chamber-maid retired, and left him alone.
Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the
fire, and fell into a train of rambling meditations. First

he thought of his friends, and wondered when they would
join him; then his mind reverted to Mrs. Martha Bar-
dell; and from that lady it wandered by a natural pro-
cess, to the dingy counting-house of Dodson and Fogg.
From Dodson and Fogg's it flew off at a tangent, to the
very centre of the history of the queer client; and then
it came back to the Great White Horse at Ipswich, with
sufficient clearness to convince Mr. Pickwick that he was
falling asleep; so he roused himself, and began to un-
dress, when he recollected he had left his watch on the
table down stairs.
Now, this watch was a special favorite with Mr. Pick-
wick, having been carried about, beneath the shadow of
his waistcoat, for a greater number of years than we feel
called upon to state, at present. The possibility of going
to sleep, unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow,
or in his watch-pocket over his head, had never entered
Mr. Pickwick's brain. So, as it was pretty late now,
and he was unwilling to ring his beil at that hour of
the night, he slipped on his coat, of which he had just
divested himself, and taking the japanned candlestick in
his hand, walked quietly down stairs.
The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more
stairs there seemed to be to descend; and again and
again, when Mr. Pickwick got into some narrow pas-
sage, and began to congratulate himself on having gained
the ground-floor, did another flight of stairs appear before
his astonished eyes. At last he reached a stone hall,
which he remembered to have seen when he entered the
house. Passage after passage did he explore; room after
room did he peep into; at length, just as he was on the
point of giving up the search in despair, he opened the

door of the identical room in which he had spent the
evening, and beheld his missing property on the table.
Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and pro-
ceeded to retrace his steps to his bed-chamber. If his
progress downwards had been attended with difficulties
and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more
perplexing. Rows of doors garnished with boots of
every shape, make, and size, branched off in every
possible direction. A dozen times did he softly turn.
the handle of some bed-room door, which resembled
his own, when a gruff cry from within, of "Who the
devil's that?" or "What do you want here?" caused
him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a marvellous celerity.
He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an open
door attracted his attention. He peeped in—right at
last. There were the two beds, whose situation he per-
fectly remembered, and the fire still burning. His can-
dle, not a long one when he first received it, had flickered
away in the draughts of air through which he had passed,
and sunk into the socket just as he closed the door after
him. "No matter," said Mr. Pickwick; "I can undress
myself just as well by the light of the fire."
The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door;
and on the inner side of each was a little path, terminat-
ing in a rush-bottomed chair, just wide enough to admit
of a person's getting into or out of bed, on that side, if
he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn the
curtains of his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat
down on the rush-bottomed chair, and leisurely divested
himself of his shoes and gaiters. He then took off and
folded up his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, and, slowly
drawing on his tasselled night-cap, secured it firmly on

his head, by tying beneath his chin the strings which
he had always attached to that article of dress.
It was
at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewilder-
ment struck upon his mind; and throwing himself back
in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed to
himself so heartily, that it would have been quite de-
lightful to any man of well-constituted mind to have
watched the smiles which expanded his amiable features
as they shone forth from beneath the night-cap.
"It is the best idea," said Mr. Pickwick to himself,
smiling till he almost cracked the night-cap strings, -
"it is the best idea, my losing myself in this place, and
wandering about those staircases, that I ever heard of.
Droll, droll, very droll." Here Mr. Pickwick smiled
again, a broader smile than before, and was about to
continue the process of undressing, in the best possible
humor, when he was suddenly stopped by a most unex-
pected interruption; to wit, the entrance into the room
of some person with a candle, who, after locking the
door, advanced to the dressing-table, and set down the
light upon it.
The smile that played on Mr. Pickwick's features was
instantaneously lost in a look of the most unbounded and
wonder-stricken surprise. The person, whoever it was,
had come in so suddenly and with so little noise, that Mr.
Pickwick had no time to call out, or oppose their en-
trance. Who could it be? A robber! Some evil-minded
person who had seen him come up stairs with a handsome
watch in his hand, perhaps. What was he to do!
The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a
glimpse of his mysterious visitor with the least danger
of being seen himself, was by creeping on to the bed,

and peeping out from between the curtains on the oppo-
site side. To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted.
Keeping the curtains carefully closed with his hand, so
that nothing more of him could be seen than his face and
night-cap, and putting on his spectacles, he mustered up
courage, and looked out.
Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay.
Standing before the dressing glass was a middle-aged
lady in yellow curl-papers, busily engaged in brushing
what ladies call their "back hair." However the un-
conscious middle-aged lady came into that room, it was
quite clear that she contemplated remaining there for the
night; for she had brought a rush-light and shade with
her, which, with praiseworthy precaution against fire, she
had stationed in a basin on the floor, where it was glim-
mering away like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly
small piece of water.
"Bless my soul," thought Mr. Pickwick, "what a
dreadful thing!"
"Hem!" said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick's
head with automaton-like rapidity.
66
“I never met with anything so awful as this," thought
poor Mr. Pickwick, the cold perspiration starting in drops
upon his night-cap. "Never. This is fearful."
It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to
see what was going forward. So out went Mr. Pick-
wick's head again. The prospect was worse than before.
The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair;
and carefully enveloped it, in a muslin night-cap with a
small plaited border, and was gazing pensively on the
fire.
"This matter is growing alarming," reasoned Mr.

Pickwick with himself. "I can't allow things to go on
in this way. By the self-possession of that lady, it's clear
to me that I must have come into the wrong room.
If I call out she'il alarm the house, but if I remain
herc, the consequence will be still more frightful!"
Mr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, was one
of the most modest and delicate-minded of mortals. The
very idea of exhibiting his night-cap to a lady, over-
powered him, but he had tied these confounded strings in
a knot, and do what he would, he couldn't get it off.
The disclosure must be made. There was only one other
way of doing it. He shrunk behind the curtains, and
called out very loudly, —
-
"Ila hum."
―――――――――
That the lady started at this unexpected sound was
evident, by her falling up against the rush-light shade;
that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect
of imagination was equally clear, for when Mr. Pick-
wick, under the impression that she had fainted away,
stone-dead from fright, ventured to peep out again, she
was gazing pensively on the fire as before.
"Most extraordinary female this," thought Mr. Pick-
wick, popping in again. "IIa — hum.”
66
These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends
inform us, the ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the
habit of expressing his opinion that it was time to lay
the cloth, were too distinctly audible to be again mis-
taken for the workings of fancy.
"
"Gracious Heaven! said the middle-aged lady,
"what's that!"
"It's it's only a gentleman, Ma'am," said Mr.
Pickwick from behind the curtains.

"A gentleman!" said the lady with a terrific scream.
"It's all over," thought Mr. Pickwick.
"A strange man!" shrieked the lady. Another instant
and the house would be alarmed. Her garments rustled
as she rushed towards the door.
"Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head,
in the extremity of his desperation, “Ma'am."
Now, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by
any definite object in putting out his head, it was in-
stantaneously productive of a good effect. The lady,
as we have already stated, was near the door. She
must pass it to reach the staircase, and she would most
undoubtedly have done so, by this time, had not the sud-
den apparition of Mr. Pickwick's night-cap driven her
back, into the remotest corner of the apartment, where
she stood staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while Mr.
Pickwick in his turn stared wildly at her.
66
Wretch," said the lady, covering her eyes with her
hands, "what do you want here?"
"Nothing, Ma'am - nothing whatever, Ma'am," said
Mr. Pickwick, earnestly.
"Nothing!" said the lady, looking up.
"Nothing, Ma'am, upon my honor," said Mr. Pick-
wick, nodding his head so energetically, that the tassel
of his night-cap danced again. "I am almost ready to
sink, Ma'am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady
in my night-cap; (here the lady hastily snatched off hers ;)
but I can't get it off, Ma'am ; (here Mr. Pickwick gave it
a tremendous tug in proof of the statement.) It is evi-
dent to me, Ma'am, now, that I have mistaken this bed-
room for my own. I had not been here five minutes,
Ma'am, when you suddenly entered it."

"If this improbable story be really true, Sir," said the
lady, sobbing violently, "you will leave it instantly."
"I will, Ma'am, with the greatest pleasure," replied
Mr. Pickwick.
"Instantly, Sir," said the lady.
"Certainly, Ma'am," interposed Mr. Pickwick, very
quickly. "Certainly, Ma'am. I-I-am very sorry,
Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, making his appearance at
the bottom of the bed, "to have been the innocent occa-
sion of this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry, Ma'am."
The lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality
of Mr. Pickwick's character was beautifully displayed at
this moment under the most trying circumstances. Al-
though he had hastily put on his hat over his night-cap,
after the manner of the old patrol; although he carried
his shoes and gaiters in his hand, and his coat and
waistcoat over his arm, nothing could subdue his native
politeness.
"I am exceedingly sorry, Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick,
bowing very low.
"If you are, Sir, you will at once leave the room,'
said the lady.
“Immediately, Maʼam; this instant, Ma'am,” said
Mr. Pickwick, opening the door, and dropping both
his shoes with a loud crash in so doing.
"I trust, Ma'am," resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering
up his shoes, and turning round to bow again, “I trust,
Ma'am, that my unblemished character, and the devoted
respect I entertain for your sex, will plead as some slight
excuse for this" - but before Mr. Pickwick could con-
clude the sentence, the lady had thrust him into the
passage, and locked and bolted the door behind him.
