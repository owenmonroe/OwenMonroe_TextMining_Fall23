THE REV. G. N. WRIGHT, A. M.
&c. &c. &c.
SIR,
When I consider the encouragement
which has been given to my exertions by your
approbation and assistance, from the period of
my commencing my present' arduous profes-
sion ; when I consider how many public advan-
tages I have derived from my connexion with
the establishment over which you preside-
an establishment, eminent alike for the success
of the principles on which it is conducted, and
the character it maintains in the metropolis ;-
and, lastly, when I consider the many acts of
private friendship you have conferred upon me;
I feel happy in having an opportunity to ac-
knowledge my various obligations.

DEDICATION.
Your judgment confirmed mine in the pro-
priety of rejecting, as exercises for the pupils
you committed to my care, the extracts con-
tained in former publications on Elocution; be-
cause, how interesting soever they may have
been when originally published, they have
ceased to influence the feelings of the reader,
or to gratify his taste.
I beg leave, therefore, to inscribe to you a
work which has for its primary object the im-
provement of your pupils. Commenced and
completed under your auspices, its best re-
commendation will be its introduction to public
notice under the sanction of a name so well
established in the literary world.
I have the Honour to be,
Sir,
Your much Obliged
And very Faithful Servant,
ROBERT JAMES BALL.

INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE
ON
ELOCUTION.
ElocutioNisa term, which, according to the
strictness of etymological definition, might be ap-
plied to signify whatever is included in the faculty
and utterance of thought, by the means of language,
.whether oral or written. The ancient writers
applied it to written composition only, having
used it to signify the choice and order of words;
and even Dryden and other moderns have followed
their example. It is now generally used to sig-
nify oratorical pronunciation. At the same time,
two other terms, oratory and eloquence, have ad-
mittance and current usage in our language, andare
occasionally used as synonyms of elocution. But
every copious subject, when it comes to be treated
in a didactic way, requires more terms of settled
distinction, than the simplicity of rigid etymology
can be expected to furnish; and many terms,
which, in the laxity of general conversation, are
indifferently and indistinctly used, must, in the
precision of scientific discussion, be carefully se-
parated, and placed in contradistinction: the very
B

INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE
admission of synonyms being perfectly inconsis-
tent with the progress and comprehension of sci-
entific truth.
These three terms, therefore, should be clearly
and distinctly defined, and the boundaries of sig-
nification assignable to each, as terms of contra-
distinction, be precisely marked out. Accordingly,
eloquence may be defined “ the art of expressing
our thoughts and feelings with precision, force,
and elegance; and of heightening the impressions
of reason, by the colourings of imagination." It
is applicable, therefore, to the whole faculty of
verbal discourse, whether oral or written. It
addresses itself by the pen, to the eye, as well as
by the living organs to the ear. Thus we speak
of an eloquent book, as freely as of an eloquent
oration; of the eloquent Buffon, (alluding to his
celebrated work upon natural history); and of
the eloquent writings, as well as the eloquent
speeches, of Edmund Burke. Oratory, on the
contrary, is precise and limited in its application:
and, in this respect, indeed, even popular usage
is pretty generally correct. It may be defined
“oral eloquence,” or “the art of communicating,
by the immediate action of the vocal and expressive
organs, to popular, or to select assemblies, the
dictates of our reason, or our will, and the workings
of our passions, feelings, and imaginations.” Ora-
tory, therefore, includes the idea of eloquence ;
for no man can be an orator who possesses not a
flow of thought and language. But eloquence
does not necessarily include the idea of oratory ;
since a man may be rich in all the stores of
language and thought, without possessing the
advantage of a graceful and impressive delivery.
Oratory is, therefore, the name of a more complex
idea, and includes, besides the general notion
of eloquence, the practical part of Elocution :
which being our immediate object, must be spoken
of more at large.


## p. 3 (#17) ###############################################

ON ELOCUTION.

Elocution may be considered as either a science,
or an art. In the former case it may be defined,
" the science by which the rules for the just de-
livery of eloquence are taught ;" in the latter,
“ the happy combination and coincidence of vo-
cal, enunciative, and gesticulative expression, by
which oratorical excitement is superadded to the
eloquence of thought and language." In other
words, elocution is the art, or the act, of so de-
livering our own thoughts and sentiments, or the
thoughts and sentiments of others, as not only to
convey to those around us, with precision, force,
and harmony, the full purport and meaning of the
words and sentences in which these thoughts are
clothed; but, also, to excite and impress upon
their minds, the feelings, the imaginations, and the
passions, by which those thoughts are dictated,
or with which they should naturally be accompa-
nied. Elocution, therefore, in its more ample
and liberal signification, is not confined to the mere
exercise of the organs of speech : it cmbraces
the whole theory and practice of the outward de-
monstration of the inward workings of the mind.
In short, eloquence may be considered as the soul,
or animating principle of discourse; and is de-
pendent on intellectual energy, and intellectual
attainments. Elocution is the embodying form,
or representative power, dependent on exterior
accomplishment, and the cultivation of the organs.
Oratory is the complicated and vital existence
resulting from the perfect harmony and combina-
tion of the two.
The object, then, of the science of elocution,
is the improvement of oral language, as contra-
distinguished from mere graphic composition; and
the cultivation of every external grace and ac-
complishment with which the delivery of language
should be accompanied : an object, to the attain-
ment of which the ancients devoted a very con-
siderable portion of attention; but which has beck
:

INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE
too generally neglected in modern times. In
those parts of oratory, indeed, which relate to the
arrangement of thought, and the energies of ex-
pressive language, there is no deficiency of exist-
ing models, and certainly no paucity whatever
of pedantic rules and treatises. Cicero and De-
mosthenes still continue to speak to the eye, in
all the eloquence of graphic words; and Quinctilian
and Blair (like two conspicuous luminaries, in the
ancient and modern hemispheres of oratorical
criticism) illumine the tracks of written language,
and may help to inform us how orations should
be composed. In this part of oratory, therefore,
the present and the preceding generations have
had something to boast. But while eloquence has
been cultivated among us with considerable dili-
gence, elocution bas been so much neglected, that
the very nature of the science seems to be, in gene-
ral, unknown: although it must be acknowledged,
that it is a science, which, how neglected soever,
deserves a considerable portion of the attention of
those wbo are intrusted with the education of
youth; on account of its practical application, at
the same time, to the noblest purposes of public
exertion, and the most familiar gratifications of
private life. For if oratorical excellence be an
object only to the few, yet that those few should
have the means of cultivating such parts of
it as appear to be within reach of systematic
tuition, is certainly highly desirable; and some
degree, at least, of elocutionary accomplishment
would, undoubtedly, be serviceable to all; with-
out dwelling upon the consideration, that it is
not always practicable to foresee, during the
season of early tuition, who shall, or who shall
not, be among the number of those few to whom
such accomplishment might be of primary im-
portance. There are few, indeed, to whom it
would not be advantageous (at least in point of
mental gratification) to be able to read, with

emphases and harmony, the fine passages of our
poets, or the instructive and elegant compositions
of our historians, moralists, and amusive writers.
There is, perhaps, scarcely any individual who
has not, occasionally, experienced the advantage
of delivering what he had to say with correctness,
ease, and impressiveness; or who, wanting this
accomplishment, has not felt the disadvantages
resulting from such defect. Even in the social
intercourses of private life, how great are the
benefits of this attainment! How does it multiply
the sources of innocent pleasure !
Elocution has been considered by many as
contradistinguishable into three several kinds, viz.
reading, recitation, and spontaneous speech; and
some professors have marked these distinctions
so absolutely, as to prescribe different styles of
utterance, both in vocal and enunciative expres-
sion, to the reader and reciter, from those which
they regard as belonging to the extemporaneous
speaker. Mr. Cockin, in particular, in an inge-
nious dissertation (pub. 1775) on “ The Art of
Delivering Written Language,” has maintained
this hypothesis; and has discussed the subject
of these supposed differences under the respective
heads of accent, emphasis, modulation, expres-
sion, (of voice as well as gesture,) and pauses.
This work, we are informed in the dedication,
was altogether approved of by Mr. Garrick, who
assured the author, " that the doctrine laid down
in that essay agreed exactly with his own senti-
ments.” The popular axiom, however, “read
exactly as you would speak,” (supposing it ad-
dressed to a good speaker,) seems, in its principle,
to be a rule much more rational than any thing that
even the ingenuity of Mr. Cockin, though applauded
by Mr. Garrick, has been able to adduce. It is
objectionable indeed, on account of its impracti-
cability; pointing out a degree of perfection that
was never yet attained, nor ever will be, till per-
B 2

INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE
fection in other arts and accomplishments shall
be attained likewise. But the principle is not
therefore the less valuable; the models of perfec-
tion must not be discarded from our minds, be-
cause art could never yet completely realize them :
and although there are impediments, perhaps
insurmountable, in the way of giving to either
reading or recitation all the ease, grace, and vi-
tality of spontaneous speech, yet, in principle,
they should assuredly be the same: for reading
and recitation are only two different modes of
imitating that nature which spontaneous speaking
exhibits in ber original reality. Mr. Cockin,
however, contends," that reading does not receive
any of its beauties from the principles of imita-
tion, being no copy, but only another kind of
speech.” That, generally it is so, cannot be de-
nied; but it is so far from unquestionable that it
ought to be so, that this may, perhaps, be assigned
as the genuine reason why the reading even of
those persons produces only sleep, whose unpre-
meditated speaking is the delight of all ears; and
why lectures never interest the auditors like
spontaneous harangues. There are, however,
certain particulars of essential distinction in the
practical facilities; and even capabilities of ex-
cellence, in reading, recitation, and original speech,
which the student of Elocution ought to under-
stand, as thereby each may, perhaps, be brought
somewhat nearer to perfection than can be ex-
pected without the due consideration of these cir-
cumstances. Thus, for example, spontaneous
speech, springing immediately from the inspiration
of feeling, with all the freshness and glow of
original conception, is capable of a degree of
warmth, ease, and flowing energy, which can be-
long only to first impressions and unpremeditated
language. From this very circumstance, how-
ever, it is incapable of all the smoothness, pro-
portion, and harmony, which a minute atttention

to euphony, construction, rhythmus, and quan-
tity, may enable the reader and reciter to accom-
plish.
The reader, on the contrary, who finds the lan-
guage ready polished to his hands, and sees it
spread out before him, has leisure for full atten-
tion to all the minutiæ of rythmical cadence; and
if his ear be good, his perceptions acute, and his
notions of the principles of elocutionary harmony
correct, he may certainly attain a degree of per-
fection of utterance, in what relates to mere pro-
portion and melody, which none but the reader
must expect. But then, on the other hand, the
reader (especially he who reads at sight; and if
he has previously studied, he becomes, in a cer-
tain degree a reciter,) pronounces what he reads,
not with the feelings of an originator or imparter,
but with those of a recipient; his mind is passive
while his organs are active: bence, inevitably, a
certain degree of coldness and unnatural restraint.
The reciter partakes of the advantages and
disadvantages of both; and he has both advan-
tages and disadvantages peculiar to himself. If
what he should repeat be completely in his me-
mory, he makes it, to a certain degree, bis own,
and may approximate to the ease of the sponta-
neous speaker, and the smooth melody of the
accomplished reader, though he can never attain
the unsophisticated warmth and vitality of the
former, or the complete rythmus and nicely mca-
sured pauses of the latter.
At the same time,
by repeated experiment, he may have adjusted his
tones and attitudes, and the expressions of his
countenance, more completely to the sentiment
and passion of the passages he is to deliver, than
the reader could possibly have done, and have
accommodated them more completely to the rules
and principles of grace, than is practicable to the
spontaneous speaker: but what he gains in force.
and propriety, he is in danger of losing in simpli-

city; and the mere reciter, how excellent soever,
is more likely to extort applause, than to awaken
the genuine sympathies of the soul.
Hence we may conclude, that though the prin-
ciples of English elocution, fundamentally con-
sidered, are the same, to which soever of these
three modes of utterance they may be applied,
yet, the practical excellencies and obvious diffi
culties of each being peculiar, the student of elo-
cution should practise in all three, whatever
department may be his ultimate object, since
reader, reciter, and spontaneous speaker, have
each something to learn from the two others, for
the full accomplishment of his own particular
branch of the art.
Another and more rational division of the art
of elocution may be made from a consideration of
the subjects to which it is applied, or the circum-
stances under which it is exercised. According
to this principle, elocution may be considered as
distinguishable into the following kinds: 1st, The
Conversational; 2nd, The Narrative; 3rd, The
Didactic ; 4th, The Authoritative, or Judicial;
5th, The Argumentative ;'6th, The Persuasive ;
7th, The Declamatory and Impassioned. Relative
to each of which the following general rules may
be laid down with respect to both voice and enun-
ciation. In the first, the enunciation should be easy
and familiar, the tone simple, the inflection limited,
and the pitch of the voice but just so far beyond
a whisper as to render it tunable. In the se-
cond, the enunciation, though exceedingly simple,
should be somewhat more precise and emphatic,
the tone clear, unostentatious, and impressive;
level, but not monotonous. In the third, both
tone and enunciation should be strong, firm, and
emphatic: and in the Authoritative or Judicial,
they shoald swell to something like pomp, min-
gled with a degree of firmness that in effect should
border on austerity, and, with respect to modu-

PRONUNCIATION,
lation, almost onmonotony. In the argumentative,
clearness of yoice, and perspicuity of enunciation
are the principal objects. In the persuasive, the
tones should be mild, insinuative, and pathetic;
the pronunciation reinote alike from the affecta-
tion of sonorousness and of precision. In this,
indeed, as in the seventh and last description of
elocution, the enunciation should rather be sub-
servient to the tone, (that is to say, to the feelings,)
than the tone to the enunciation; as the object of
the speaker is to be understood rather by the heart
than by the understanding. In subjects and pas-'
sages of strong passion and emotion, the enun-
ciation should be occasionally accelerated and
retarded; apparently wild and irregular, but al-
ways obedient to the changes of passion and sen-
timent; the modulation excessively varied, and
the voice ranging through great varieties of soft-
ness, force, and vehemence, of acuteness and
gravity, and the whole compass of expressive or
reflective intonation.
The four great schools of elocution, or rather
the four great theatres for the exhibition of that
talent, are, the Bar, the Pulpit, the Senate, and
the Stage; each of which shall be treated of in
its proper place.
Pronunciation,
PRONUNCIATION is used for the fourth and last
part of rhetoric, called delivery, which consists
in regulating and varying the voice and gesture
ágreeably to the matter and words; so as the more
effectually to persuade and touch the hearers.
Dr. Campbell divides pronunciation into two
kinds, viz. grammaticaland rhetorical. The former,
he says, consists in articulating audibly and dis-
tinctly, the letters, whether vowels or consonants,
assigning to each its appropriated sound, in giving
the several syllables their just quantity, and in

10
PRONUNCIATION.
placing the accent in every word on the proper
syllable. Rhetorical pronunciation, he adds,
consists in giving such an utterance to the several
words in a sentence, as shows in the mind of the
speaker a strong perception, or, as it were, feel-
ing of the truth and justness of the thought con-
veyed by them; and in placing the rhetorical
emphasis in every sentence, on the proper word,
that is, on that word which, by being pronounced
emphatically, gives the greatest energy and clear-
ness to the expression. These two kinds of pro-
nunciation are so perfectly distinct, that each
may be found in a very eminent degree without
the other. The former is merely an effect of
education ; insomuch that one who has always
mixed in genteel society, and who has been taught
to read by a sufficient teacher, must be master of
grammatical pronunciation; provided that he la-
bours underno natural defect in the organs of speech.
He
may pronounce so as to defy the censure of the
most critical grammarian, and yet be, in the judg-
ment of the rhetorician, a most languid and in-
animate speaker, totally ignorant of rhetorical
pronunciation. In respect of the latter, it is the
production of nature; but it is capable of being
considerably improved and polished by education.
You will often find speakers, who possess con-
siderable talents for oratorical pronunciation, in-
somuch that they can excite and fix attention ;
that they can both please and move ; that their
voice seems capable alike of being modulated to
soothe the passions or to inflame them; yet in
whose pronunciation a grammarian may discover
innumerable defects. There is this difference,
however, between the two cases, that though the
grammatical pronunciation may be perfect with-
out the rhetorical, the latter is never in perfection
without the former. As, therefore, grammatical
pronunciation is so essential to the finished orator,
the learner should make it a primary object. Ex-

ample goes a great way. He should attend to
the manner of the best speakers to whose company
he has access, and be shall insensibly conform
bimself to it. Grammars and dictionaries may be
of great use, but they are not sufficient without
other aid. Distinctions discernible by the ear
only, can never be adequately conveyed by the
eye alone. There is one part of pronunciation,
however, and a very important one, which may
be learned solely by book, and that is, the placing
of the accent.
The pronunciation is of such importance, that
Demosthenes called it the first, second, and third
part of eloquence. Quinctilian defines the pro-
nunciation, “vocis, et vultus, et corporis modera-
tio cum venustate ;" a decent, agreeable manner of
managing the voice, gesture, and action of the
whole body. Cicero somewhere calls it, “ qua-
dam corporis eloquentia ;” a certain eloquence of
the body; and in another place, " sermo corporis,”
the language or speech of the body.
When we address others by words, itis certainly
our intention to make some impression on those
to whom we speak; and it is certain that the tone
of our voice, our looks, and gestures, interpret our
ideas and emotions no less than words do ; nay,
the impression they make on others is frequently
much stronger than any which words can make.
The signification of our sentiments, made by tones
and gestures, has this advantage over that made by
words, that it is the language of nature. The
connexion is so close between certain sentiments,
and the proper manner of pronouncing them, that
he who does not pronounce them after that man-
ner, can never persuade us that he believes or
feels the sentiments themselves. His delivery
may be such, as to give the lie to all that he asserts.
When Marcus Callidius accused one of an attempt
to poison him, but enforced his accusation in a
languid manner, and without any warmtb, or

earnestness of delivery, Cicero, who pleaded for
the accused person, improved this into an argu-
ment of the falsity of the charge, “ An tu, M. Cal-
lidi, nisi fingeres, sic ageres ?” In Shakespear's
Richard II., the Duchess of York thus impeaches
the sincerity of ber husband.
« Pleads he in earnest ?-Look upon his face,
His eyes do drop no tears; his prayers are jest;
His words come from his mouth; ours from our
breast;
He prays but faintly, and would be denied ;
We pray with heart and soul.”
In public speaking, a proper attention to pronun-
ciation or delivery is, as has been already stated,
of the greatest importance, and the importance of
it will farther appear if we consider the principal
objects which every public speaker has in view.
These are, first of all, to pronounce so as to be
fully and easily understood by all who hear him;
and secondly, to speak with grace and force, so
as to please and move his audience. In the at-
tainment of the first object, the four chief requi-
sites are—a due degree of loudness of voice, dis-
tinctness, slowness, and propriety of pronuncia-
tion. A public speaker who wishes to be heard
by all whom he addresses, should endeavour to
fill with his voice the space occupied by the as-
sembly. For this purpose independently of the
power of voice derived from nature, much depends
on the proper pitch and management of the voice.
Every man, says Dr. Blair, has three pitches
in his voice, the high, the middle, and the low
The 'high is that which he uses in calling
aloud to some persons at a distance, the low is,
when he approaches to a whisper, and the middle
is that which he employs in common conversation,
and which he should generally use in public dis-
course. It is a great mistake to imagine that one
one.

must take the highest pitch of bis voice, in order
to be well heard by a large assembly. This is
confounding two things which are different; loud-
ness, or strength of sound, with the key, or note
on which we speak. A speaker may render his
voice louder, without altering his key; and we
shall always be able to give most body, most
persevering force of sound, to that pitch of voice
to which we are accustomed in conversation :
whereas, by setting out on our highest pitch or
key, we certainly allow ourselves less compass,
and are likely to strain our voice before we are
done. We shall fatigue ourselves, and speak
with pain; and whenever a man speaks with pain
to himself, he is always heard with pain by his
audience. Give the voice, therefore, full strength
and swell of sound; but always pitch it on your
ordinary speaking key. Make it a constant rule
never to emit a greater quantity of voice than you
can afford without pain to yourself, and without
any extraordinary effort. As long as you keep
within these bounds, the other organs of speech
will be at liberty to discharge their several offices
with ease; and you will always have your voice
under command. But whenever you transgress
these bounds, you give up the reins of your voice,
and no longer have any management of it. It is
an useful rule too, in order to be well heard, to fix
the eye on some of the most distant persons in the
assembly, and to consider ourselves as speaking
to them. But it should be remembered, that in
public, as well as in conversation, we may give
disgust and offence by speaking too loud; because
the speaker has thus the appearance of one who
endeavours to compel assent, by mere vehemence
and force of sound.
Moreover, in order to be well heard and clearly
understood, distinctness of articulation contri-
butes more, perhaps, than loudness of sound. With
this view, every public speaker should give every

sound which he utters its due proportion, and
make every syllable, and even every letter in the
word which he pronounces, be heard distinctly,
without slurring, whispering, or suppressing any
of the proper sounds.
Further, in order to articulate distinctly, mode-
ration is requisite with regard to the speed of pro-
nouncing. Precipitancy of speech confounds all
articulation, and all meaning: and yet the contrary
extreme should be avoided ; as a lifeless, drawling
pronunciation, which allows the minds of the
hearers to be always outrunning the speaker, must
render every discourse insipid and fatiguing. After
all, to pronounce with a proper degree of slow-
ness, and with full and clear articulation, is the
first thing to be studied by all who begin to speak
in public, and cannot be too earnestly recom-
mended. Such a pronunciation gives weight and
dignity to a discourse. It greatly aids the voice,
by affording pauses and rests, and it enables the
speaker to swell all his sounds both with more
force, and more music. It also assists in main-
taining a due self-command; whereas a rapid
and hurried manner is apt to excite that flutter of
spirits, which is very injurious to right execution
in the province of oratory.
Promptum sit os," says Quinctilian, “non pre-
ceps, moderatum, non lentum."
After the attention now recommended to the
pitch and management of the voice, to distinct ar-
ticulation, and to a proper degree of slowness of
speech, the public speaker should diligently study
propriety of pronunciation; or the giving to every
word, which he utters, that sound which the most
polite usage of the language appropriates to it;
in opposition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pro-
nunciation.
This is requisite, both for speaking intelligibly,
and for speaking with grace and beauty. In this

connexion it is not improper to recommend a par-
ticular attention to the accent. See Accent.
Voice,
Voice, in oratory, is one of the parts of pronun-
ciation ; upon the proper regulation of which much
of the orator's success depends. For this purpose
it will be right to observe, in general, what nature
does, when free and unconstrained. As persons
are differently affected when they speak, so they
naturally alter the tone of their voice: it rises,
sinks, and has various inflections given it, accord-
ing to the present state and disposition of the mind.
When the mind is calm and sedate, the voice is
moderate and even ; when the former is dejected
with sorrow, the latter is languid ; and when that
is inflamed by passion, this is raised and elevated.
It is the orator's business, therefore, to follow na--
ture, and to endeavour that the tone of his voice
appear natural and unaffected: and for this end,
he must take care to suit it to the nature of the
subject; but still so as to be always grave and
decent.
The principal affections or properties of the
voice may be referred to either quantity or quali.
ty. The quantity of the voice consists in its high-
ness or lowness, swiftness or slowness, and the
intermediate degrees between them. Every per-
son who speaks in public should endeavour, if he
can, to fill the place where he speaks, without ex-
ceeding the natural key of his voice; in which
case it will be either harsh and rough, or too shrill
and squeaking ; nor will he be able to give every
syllable its full and distinct sound, and to inflect
it properly. He should also take care, that it do
not sink too low, which will give him pain to raise
it again to its proper pitch, and be no less offen-
sive to the hearers. The last word of a sentence
ought, in a particular manner, to be expressed

VOICE.
distinctly, because the meaning of the whole sen-
tence often depends upon it. The medium be-
tween these two is a moderate and even voice,
which every person must regulate by the natural
key of his own voice. But this equality of voice
must be accompanied with a variety of inflections
and changes within the same pitch; and the gra-
dations, whether higher or lower, must be gentle
and regular; the voice moving from one key to
another, so as rather to glide like a gentle stream,
than pour down like a rapid torrent: and the degree
of these inflections and various tones of voice
should differ, according to the nature of the subject
and design of the speaker.
The next property of the voice is swiftness ;
and with regard to this, care should be taken to
avoid the two extremes of hurrying precipitately
without pausing, which destroys not only the ne-
cessary distinction between sentence and sen-
tence, but likewise between the several words of
the same sentence; and of speaking so slowly, as
to argue a heaviness in the speaker, and to render
the discourse flat and lifeless.
In order to avoid both these extremes, the voice
ought to be sedate and distinct; for which pur-
pose it is necessary not only that each word and
syllable should have its full and just sound, both
as to time and accent, but, likewise, that every
sentence and part of a sentence, should be se-
parated by its proper pause and interval. See
Pausing.
The properties of the voice, that respect its
qualities, are, chiefly, strength or weakness, clear-
ness or obscureness, fulness or smallness, smooth-
ness or roughness. Temperance is a great pre-
servative of the voice in all these respects, and
all excess is highly prejudicial to it. A strong
voice is very serviceable to the orator, because, it
he wants some other advantages, be is, however,
able to make himself heard ; and if he is forced to

17
strain it, he is less in danger of its failing him, be-
fore he has finished his discourse. But he who
has a weak voice, should be careful not to strain
it, especially at first : he ought to begin low, and
raise it gradually to such a pitch, as the key of
his voice will carry him to, without being obliged
to sink it afterwards. Frequent inflections of
the voice will likewise relieve him; and he
should speak deliberately, and ease his voice, by
allowing due time for respiration at all the proper
pauses.
A voice is said to be clear, when the organs of
speech are suited to give every single letter, and
all the combinations of them in syllables and
words, their proper and distinct sounds. Such a
voice is agreeable to the hearers, and advanta-
geous to the speaker; as by speaking moderately,
he may be distinctly heard, and thus be able to
modulate his voice at pleasure.
An obscure and confused voice is sometimes
owing to a deficiency in the organ, but it is often
the effect of bad habit, acquired by either mis-
placing the accent, confounding the sound of the
letters, or huddling the syllables one upon another,
so as to render what is said unintelligible.
A full voice is not the same as a strong or an
loud voice ;. it, fills the ear, but it is often not
pleasing; and, therefore, to render it so, as well
as audible, it should be frequently varied. Those
who have the misfortune of possessing a very small
voice, should be cautious of raising it to too high
a pitch, especially at once; because the sudden
compression of the organ is apt to occasion a
squeaking and very disagreeable sound. A soft
and smooth voice is, of all, the most musical,
especially if it be flexible; and, on the contrary,
nothing is less harmonious than a voice that is
harsh and rough.
Upon the whole, we may conclude that voice
to be the best or fittest for an orator, which is
C 2

moderate, distinct, firm, clear, and smooth, and
also easily flexible to the several degrees and
variations of sound, which every part of the dis-
course may require. The different parts of a dis-
course require corresponding modulations of the
voice. The orator should speak low at first, be-
cause this has the appearance of modesty, engages
attention, and is best for the voice. In the nar-
ration, the voice ought to be raised to somewhat
a higher pitch. The proposition, or subject of
the discourse, should be delivered with a clear and
audible voice. The confirmation admits of great
variety, both of the voice and gestures: in reason-
ing, the voice is quick and pungent, and should
be enforced with suitable actions; and in descrip-
tions, whilst the orator is pointing out the images
of things, he should so endeavour to adapt both
his voice and the motions of his body, particularly
the turn of his eyes, and action of his hands, as
may best help the imagination of his hearers.
When he introduces another person speaking, or
addresses an absent person, it should be with
some degree of imitation; and in dialogue the
voice should alter with the parts. When he diverts
from his subject by any digression, bis voice
should be lively and cheerful ; since that is rather
designed for entertainment and instruction. In
confutation, the arguments of the adverse party
ought first to be repeated in a plain and distinct
manner, unless they appear unworthy of a serious
answer; and then a facetious manner, both of
expression and gesture, may be the most proper
way to confute them. In the conclusion, both the
voice and gesture should be brisk and sprightly.
In sentences, regard should be had to their
length, and the number of their parts, in order to
distinguish them by proper pauses. The frame
and structure of the period ought likewise to be
considered, that the voice may be so managed as
to give it the most musical accent. Unless there

be some special reason for the contrary, it should
end louder than it begins.
As to the passions, it is evident that each of
them requires a different voice and action. Love
and esteem are expressed in a smooth and cheer-
ful tone; but anger and resentment with a rough,
harsh, and interrupted voice. Joy raises and
dilates the voice; as sorrow sinks and contracts
it. Fear occasions a tremour and hesitation of the
voice; and assurance gives it strength and firmness.
Admiration elevates the voice, and should be
expressed with pomp and magnificence; the ex-
pression of it being often accompanied with an
elevation both of the eyes and hands : on the
contrary, contempt sinks and protracts the voice.
See Passions.
All exclamations should be violent. When
we address inanimate things, the voice should be
higher, than when we address animated beings;
and appeals to heaven must be made in a loftier
tone than those to men.
Articulation.
ARTICULATION is a branch of elocution; and,
as such, a good articulation consists in giving
every letter in a syllable its due proportion of
sound, according to the most approved custom
of pronouncing it; and in making such a distinc-
tion between the syllables of which words are
composed, that the ear shall, without difficulty,
acknowledge their number, and perceive, at once,
.to which syllable each letter belongs.
Where these points are not observed, the ar-
ticulation is proportionably defective. Exactness
in sounding the words rightly, corresponds to pro-
priety in spelling; and the articulation should be
so clear and distinct, that the hearer may, with
ease, keep pace with the speaker. A good arti-
culation is the foundation of a good delivery; in

ARTICULATION.
he same manner as the sounding of the simple
notes in music with exactness, is the foundation
of good singing. As for the grosser faults of ar-
ticulation, such as stuttering, hesitation, lisping,
and inability to pronounce certain letters, they
can scarcely be cured by mere precept, but require
the constant aid of a person skilled in the causes
of those faults; who, by teaching each individual
how to use the organs of speech rightly, and by
shewing him the proper position of the tongue,
lips, &c. may gradually bring him to a just ar-
ticulation.
The first and most essential point in articulation,
is distinctness, and its opposite is the greatest
fault. The chief source of indistinctness is too
great a precipitancy of speech. To this hasty
delivery, which drops some letters, and pronounces
others too faintly; which runs syllables into each
other, and clusters words together, is owing that
thick, mumbling, cluttering utterance, of which ex-
amples are too frequent. For curing any imper-
fections in speech arising originally from too quick
an utterance, the most effectual method will be
to employ an hour every morning in reading aloud,
in a manner much slower than is necessary. Let
a friend or some person attend, whose business it
shall be to remind the reader, if he should quicken
his pace, and recur to bis old habit of rapid utter-
ance. Those words should be marked, which are
passed over most hastily, and they should be re-
peatedly pronounced, every morning, clearly and
distinctly. As in our language, words of more
syllables than one have one syllable accented,
and peculiarly distinguished from the rest, either
by a smart percussion of the voice, or by dwelling
upon it, the other syllables are often negligently
articulated. In order to bring those, whose ut-
terance is so rapid, to a due medium, they should
accustom themselves to pronounce the unaccented
syllables more fully, and to dwell longer upon them.

PUNCTUATION.
21
Punctuation,
PUNCTUATION is the art of pointing, or sub-
dividing a discourse into sentences and members of
sentences, by points expressing the pauses to be
made in the reading or reciting of it; and neces
sary both for understanding and pronouncing it.
The points that are used are four; viz. the
period, the colon, the semicolon, and the comma.
There is much more difficulty in pointing than
is commonly imagined. In effect, there is scarcely
any thing in the province of the grammarian so
little fixed and ascertained as this. The rules
usually laid down are impertinent, dark, and defi-
cient; and the practice, at present, is perfectly
capricious; authors varying not only from one
another, but even from themselves,
In general, the comma is used to distinguish
nouns from nouns, verbs from verbs, and such
other parts of a sentence as are not necessarily
joined together. The semicolon serves to suspend
and sustain the sentence when too long; the colon
to add some new, supernumerary reason, or con-
sequence, to what is already said; and the pe-
riod, to close the sense and construction, and to
release the voice.
Besides these primary points, which distinguish
sentences, there are others, which Dr. Ward, for-
merly Professor of Oratory at Gresham, calls note
affectuum; and which, Dr. Lowth says, denote a dif-
ferent modulation of the voice in correspondence
with the sense: such are a point of interrogation
(?), wbich intimates a question asked; a point of
exclamation, or admiration (!), which marks sud-
deo surprise or wondering; and a parenthesis.
The interrogation and exclamation points are
indeterminate as to their quantity or time, and
may be equivalent in that respect to a semicolon,
a colon, or a period, as the sense requires.


## p. 22 (#36) ##############################################

22
THE COMMA.
The parenthesis, which encloses in the body of
a sentence a member inserted into it, that is
neither necessary to the sense, nor at all affects
the construction, marks a moderate depression of
the voice with a pause greater than a comma.
The points or pauses in discourse, it is ob-
served, are in a kind of musical proportion. The
comma stops the reader or speaker's voice while
he may privately tell one; the semicolon, two;
the colon, three; and the period, or full stop,
four. Others make the stop at the colon, four;
and at the period, six. Professor Ward observes,
that the suspension of the voice should be twice
as long for a comma as between words separated
by no mark of distinction; tbrice for the semi-
colon; and so on in the same proportion. Bishop
Lowth assigns to the period a pause in duration
double the colon; to the colon, double of the semi-
colon; and to the semicolon, double of the comma:
so that they are in the same proportion to one
another as the semibreve, the minim, the crotchet,
and the quaver, in music.
The Comma.
It is very difficult to fix the precise use of the
comma; different authors define and use it diffe-
rently: the ordinary doctrine is, that the comma
serves to distinguish nouns, verbs, adverbs, and
the several parts of a period that are not neces-
sarily joined together. But this conveys no clear,
precise idea.
F. Buffier has carried the doctrine
of the comma farther: according to him, the comma
serves to distinguish those members of a period,
in each whereof there is a verb and the nominative
case of the verb. Thus, “ That so many people
are pleased with trifles is owing to a weakuess of
mind, which makes them love things easy to bo
comprehended."


## p. 23 (#37) ##############################################

THE COMMA.
23
Besides this, the comma is used to distinguish,
in the same member of a period, several substan-
tives, adjectives, or verbs, not united by a con-
junction. Thus, “ Virtue, wit, knowledge, are
the chief advantages of a man ;” or, “A man
never becomes learned without studying constant.
ly, methodically, with a just application, &c.”
If words of this kind be united in the same
phrase by a conjunction, the comma is omitted :
thus, “The imagination and the judgment do not
always, agree.” The comma may also be omitted
between phrases that are very short, especially
if they depend upon the same regimen, and are
united by a conjunction : thus, “ Alexander con-
quered Asia and established the monarchy of the
Greeks.”
The ingenious author of the tract, “ De Ratione
Interpungendi," printed with Vossius's Element.
Rhetor. Lond. 1724, lays down the use of a com-
ma to be, to distinguish the simple members of a
period, or sentence; i. e., such as only consist of
one subject and one finite verb. But this rule does
not hold good throughout; the same author in-
stancing many particular cases, not included here-
in, where the comma is yet advisable. Some.
times, for instance, a proposition includes another,
which may be called partitive, as being only a
part of the entire phrase ; in which case the two
are to be divided from each other by commas:
thus, “He always says, as he tells us, the finest
things in the world.”
In general tbe following rule will be our best
criterion. A simple sentence, that is, such a one
as consists of only one subject and one finite verb,
admits of no pause: for example, we are able to
say, “ Religion gives part of its reward in hand,”
without pausing ; but were we to add a new mem-
ber, with a verb and adjuncts of its own, it would
become a compound sentence, and require a point
on each side of the additional member; thus,


## p. 24 (#38) ##############################################

24
THE SEMICOLON.
Religion, which deserves universal regard, gives
part of its reward in hand." In every sentence,
therefore, the number of subjects, or finite verbs,
with their adjuncts, which are either expressed or
implied, must be distinguished by points and
pauses.“ Temper, moderation, humility, a tole-
ration of harmless levity, and an attention to mere
trifles, are endowments in our commerce with man-
kind,” is a compound sentence, equivalent to as
many simple ones, as it consists of members, and
therefore each of its members must require a
comma and a pause.
►
The Semicolon.
DR. WARD was, perhaps, the first who settled
a just use of the semicolon. His position is, that
the semicolon is properly used to distinguish the
conjunct members of sentences. Now by a con-
junct member of a sentence, he means, such a
one as contains at least two simple members.
Whenever, therefore, a sentence can be divided
into several members of the same degree, wbich
are again divisible into other simple members, the
former are to be separated by a semicolon. For
example: “If Fortune bear a great sway over him,
who has nicely stated and concerted every cir-
cumstance of an affair; we must not commit every
thing, without reserve, to Fortune, lest she should
have too great a hold of us.
According to Bishop Lowth, a member of a sen-
tence, whether simple or compound, that requires
a greater pause than a comma, yet does not of
itself make a complete sentence, but is followed
by something closely depending on it, may be dis-
tinguished by a semicolon. For example: -" But
as this passion for admiration, when it works ac-
cording to reason, improves the beautiful part of
our species in every thing that is laudable; so no-
thing is more destructive to them, when it is go-

THE COLON."
25
verned by vanity and 'folly.” Here the whole
sentence is divided into two parts by the semi-
colon ; each of which parts is a compound mem-
ber, divided into its simple members by the
comma.
The most general rule for the semicolon will be
as follows. When a sentence can be divided into
two or more members, which are again divisible
into smaller members, the former should be sepa-
rated by a semicolon, thus: “ As the passion for
admiration, when it works according to reason,
improves the beautiful part of our species in every
thing that is laudable; so nothing is more de-
structive to them, when it is governed by vanity,
or flows from pride."
6 As we
The Colon.
According to the author of the discourse
“ De Ratione Interpungendi,” already mentioned,
a colon serves to distinguish those conjunct mem-
bers of a sentence; which are capable of being di-
vided into other members, whereof one, at least,
is conjunct. Thus, in the sentence,
cannot discern the shadow moving along the dial-
plate, so the advances we make in knowledge are
only perceived by the distance gone over;" the
two members being both simple, are separated only
by a comma: in this sentence, “ As we perceive
the shadow to have moved, but did not perceive
it moving ; so our advances in understanding,
in that they consist of such minute steps, are
only perceivable by the distance ;" the sentence
being divided into two equal parts, and those
conjunct ones, since they include others, we se-
parate the former by a semicolon, and the latter
by commas: but in this, “ As we perceive the
shadow to have moved along the dial, but did not
perceive it moving; and it appears that the grass

THE PERIOD.
has grown, though nobody ever saw it grow: so.
the advances we make in knowledge, as they con-
sist of such minute steps, are only perceivable by
the distance." The advancement in knowledge
is compared to the motion of a shadow, and the
growth of grass; which comparison divides the
sentence into two principal parts: but since what is
said of the movement of the shadow, and likewise
of the growth of grass, contains two simple mem-
bers, they are separated by a semicolon; conse-
quently, a higher pointing is required to separate
them from the other part of the sentence, which
they are opposed to; and this is a colon.
When any member of a sentence makes perfect
sense, and does not excite expectation of what
follows, it may be marked with a colon. Ex. “The
Augustan age was so eminent for good poets,
that they have served as a model for all others :
yet it did not produce any good tragic poets.'
The Period,
When a sentence is so completely finished, as
not to be joined in construction with any thing
that follows, it must be marked with a period.
Ex. “ Whether I am praised or blamed,” says a
Chinese philosopher, “ I make it of use to my ad-
vancement in virtue. These who commend me, I
conceive to point out the way I ought to go; those
who blame me, as telling me the dangers I have
run.” But the period may be sometimes admit-
ted, though sentences are joined by a copulative
or disjunctive conjunction : as, “In passing judg-
ment upon the character of men, we ought to try
them by the principles and maxims of their own

Pausing.
The use of pausés is equally necessary to the
speaker and to the hearer; to the speaker, that he
may take breath, without which he cannot pro-
ceed far in his delivery ; and that he may relieve,
by these temporary rests, the organs of speech,
which, otherwise, would be soon tired by continued
and uninterrupted action: to the hearer, that the
ear also may be relieved from the fatigue which it
would otherwise endure, from a continuity of
sound; and that the understanding may have suf-
ficient time to mark the distinction of sentences,
and their several members.
Pauses in common discourse, and in most com-
positions, have, besides the duration, marks of a
surer kind annexed to them, to point out their na-
ture : and there are certain inflections of the voice,
which declare of what kind the pauses are, át the
instant they are made; and inform the mind what
it is to expect from them: whether the sense is
still to be continued in the same sentence; whe-
ther the preceding one is to be the last member
of the sentence; or whether the sentence is
closed, and a new one is to begin. By means of
these inflections, the speaker may proportion his
pauses to the importance of the sense, and not
merely to the grammatical structure of words in
sentences. A proposition or sentiment of pecu-
liar moment, may be preceded or closed by a
longer pause than usual: a pause may be also
made before some very emphatical word; but this
is a liberty that should be used with great cau-
tion. An ingenious writer on this subject ob-
serves, that pauses in general depend upon em-
phasis : words are sufficiently distinguished from
each other by accent, but to point out their meaning
when ranged in sentences, empbasis and pauses
are necessary. Accent, says this writer, is the link
which connects syllables together, and forms them

into words : emphasis is the link, which connects
words together, and forms them into members of
sentences; but that there may be no mistake to
which emphasis the words belong, at the end of
every such member of a sentence there ought
to be a perceptible pause.-Sheridan's Lectures.
Pauses are commonly distinguished into those
that are emphatical, and those that mark the dis-
tinction of sense. An emphatical pause is made,
after something has been said of peculiar moment,
and on which we want to fix the hearer's atten-
tion. Sometimes such a thing is introduced with
a pause of this nature. Such pauses bave the ef-
fect of a strong emphasis, and are subject to the
same rules; especially to the caution of not repeat-
ing them too frequently: for, as they excite un-
common attention, and, of course, raise expec-
tation, they will occasion disappointment and
disgust, if the importance of the matter be not
fully answerable to such expectation. But the
most frequent and the priocipal use of pauses is,
to mark the divisions of the sense, and, as we
have already said, to allow the speaker to draw
his breath. The proper and graceful adjustment
of such pauses is one of the most nice and difficult
articles in delivery. The speaker, in order to avoid
mangling bis sentences, and totally losing the
force of the emphasis, should be careful to pro-
vide a full supply of breath for what he is to
utter. It is a great mistake, says Dr. Blair, to
imagine that the breath must be drawn only at
the end of a sentence, when the voice is allowed a
fall. It may easily be gathered at intervals of the
sentence, when the voice is only suspended for a
moment; and by this management one may have
always a sufficient stock for carrying on the long-
est sentences without improper interruptions.
If any one, as the same ingenious author observes,
shall bave formed to himself a certain melody or
tune, which requires rests and pauses of its own,

distinct from those of the sense, he has, undoubt-
edly, contracted one of the worst habits into which
a public speaker can fall. It is the sense which
should always end the pauses of the voice ; for
whenever there is any sensible suspension of the
voice, the hearer is always led to expect some-
what corresponding in the meaning. Pauses, in
public discourse, must be formed in the manner
in which we utter ourselves in ordinary and sensi-
ble conversation, and not upon the stiff, artificial
manner which we acquire from reading books,
according to the common punctuation, which is
often arbitrary, capricious, and false, and dictates
an uniformity of tone in the pauses, that is ex.
tremely disagreeable.
In reading or reciting verse, there is a peculiar
difficulty in making the pauses justly. The dif-
ficulty arises from the melody of verse, which
dictates to the ear pauses or notes of its own;
and to adjust and compound these properly with
the pauses of the sense, so as neither to hurt the
ear nor offend the understanding, is so very nice a
matter, that it is no wonder we seldom meet with
good readers of poetry. There are two kinds of
pauses that belong to the music of verse : one is
the pause at the end of the line ; and the other,
the cæsural pause in the middle of it.
With regard to the pause at the end of the line,
which marks the strain or verse to be finished,
rhyme renders this always sensible, and in some
measure compels us to observe it in our pronun-
ciation. In blank verse, where a greater liberty is
allowed of running the lines into one another,
sometimes without any suspension in the sense,
it has been questioned, wbether, in reading such
verse with propriety, any regard at all should be
had to the close of the line. On the stage, where
the appearance of speaking in verse should always
be avoided, there can be no doubt, in the opi-
nion of Dr. Blair, that the close of such lines as
D 2

make no pause in the sense, should not be rendered
perceptible to the ear. But on other occasions,
this would be improper: for what is the use of
melody, or for what end has the poet composed
in verse, if, in reading bis lines, we suppress his
numbers, and degrade them, by our pronunciation,
into mere prose? We ought, therefore, certainly
to read blạnk verse so as to piake every line
sepsible to the ear. At the same time, in doing
so, every appearance of sing-song and tone must
be carefully avoided. The close of the line, where
it makes no pause in the meaning, ought to be
marked, not by such a tone as is used in finisbing
a sentence; but, without either letting the voice
fall, or elevating it, it should be marked only by
such a slight suspension of sound, as may dis-
tinguish the passage from one line to another,
without injuring the meaning.
The other kind of musical pause, is that which
falls somewhere about the middle of the verse,
and divides it into two hemistichs ; a pause not
so great as that which belongs to the close of the
line, but still sensible to an ordinary ear. This,
which is called the cæsural pause, falls uniformly,
in the French laconic verse, on the middle of the
line. In the English, it may fall after the fourth,
fifth, sixth, or seventh syllable in the line, and no
other. Where the verse is so constructed, that
this cæsural pause coincides with the slightest
pause or division in the sense, the line can be
read easily ; as in the two first verses of Mr.
Pope's Messiah :
“ Ye nymphs of Solyma! begin the song;
To heavenly themes, sublimer strains belong.'
But if it shall bappen that words, which have
such a strict and intimate, connexion, as not to
bear even a momentary separation, are divided
from one another by this cæsural pause, we then

31
feel a sort of struggle between the sense and
the sound, which renders it difficult to read such
lines gracefully. The rule of proper pronuncia-
tion in such cases is, to regard only the pause
which the sense forms, and to read the line ac-
cordingly. The neglect of the cæsural pause may
make the line sound somewhat unbarmoniously;
but the effect would be much worse, if the sense
were sacrificed to the sound. For instance, in
the following line of Milton :
What in me is dark,
Illumine; what is low, raise and support.”
The sense clearly dictates the pause after illu-
mine, in the end of the third syllable, which, in
reading, ought to be made accordingly; though, if
the melody only were to be regarded, illumine
should be connected with what follows, and the
pause not made till the fourth or sixth syllable.
So in the following line of Mr. Pope's Epistle to
Mr. Arbuthnot:
“ I sit, with sad civility I read.”
The ear plainly points out the cæsural pa
as falling after sad, the fourth syllable. But it
would be very bad reading to make any pause
there, so as to separate sad and civility. The
sense admits of no other pause than after the
second syllable, sit, wbich, therefore, must be the
only pause made in the reading.
It is a distinguishing advantage of our English
verse, that it allows the pause to be varied through
four different syllables in the line; for as the pause
is placed after one or other of these syllables, the
melody of the verse is much changed, its air and
cadence are diversified. By these means un-
common richness and variety are added to English.
versification. When the pause falls earliest, that

is, after the fourth syllable, the briskest melody
is thereby formed, and the most spirited air given
to the line. In the following lines of the Rape of
the Lock, Mr. Pope has, with exquisite propriety,
suited the construction of the verse to the sub-
ject.
“ On her white breast I a sparkling cross she
wore,
Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore ;
Her lively looks / a sprightly mind disclose,
Quick as her eyes | and as unfixed as those:
Favours to none to all she smiles extends,
Oft she rejects | but never once offends."
Where the pause falls after the fifth syllable,
wbich divides the line into two equal portions,
the melody is sensibly altered. The verse loses
that brisk and sprightly air, which it had with the
former pause, and becomes more smooth, gentle,
and flowing
“ Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,
Each prayer accepted | and each wish resigned.”
When the pause proceeds to follow the sixth syl-
lable, the tenor of the music becomes solemn and
grave.
The verse marches now with a more slow
and measured pace, than in either of the two for-
mer cases..
“ The wrath of Peleus' son the direful spring
Of all the Grecian woes O Goddess sing!"
But the grave, solemn cadence, becomes still
more sensible, when the pause falls after the se-
venth syliable, which is the nearest place to the
end of the line that it can occupy. This kind of
verse occurs the seldomest, but has a happy ef-
fect in diversifying the melody. It produces that

“And in the smooth description | murmur still."
Long lov'd, adored ideas! | all adieu."
A Practical System of Rhetorical Punctuation.
Before we give such directions for pausing,
or dividing a sentence, as will, in some measure,
enable us to avoid the errors of common punctua-
tion, and to point for ourselves; it will be neces-
sary to inquire into the nature of a sentence, and
to distinguish it into its different kinds.
Sentences are divided into simple and complex,
A simple sentence contains but one subject and
one finite verb, with their adjuncts. “Complex sen-
tences,” says Dr. Campbell (Philos. of Rhetoric,)
“ are of two kinds. They are either periods, or
sentences of looser composition, for which the
language doth not furnish us with a particular
narne.
“A period is a complex sentence, wherein the
meaning remains suspended, till the whole is
finished. The connexion, consequently, is so
close between the beginning and the end, as to
give rise to the name period, which signifies cir-
cuit. The following is such a sentence:
“Corruption could not spread with so much
success, though reduced into system, and though
some ministers, with equal impudence and folly,
allowed it, by themselves and their advocates, to
be the principal expedient by which they governed,
if a long and almost unobserved progression of
causes and effects did not prepare the conjunc-
ture.'-Bolingbroke's Spirit of Patriotism.
“The criterion of a period is this : If you stop
any where before the end, the preceding words


## p. 34 (#48) ##############################################

34
RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
will not form a sentence, and therefore cannot
convey any determined sense. This is plainly
the case with the above example. The first verb
being could and not can, the potential and not the
indicative mood, shows that the sentence is hypo-
thetical, and requires, to its completion, some
clause beginning with if, unless, or some other
conditional particle ; and after you are come to
the conjunction, you find no part where you can
stop before the end.
“An example of a complex sentence that is not
a period, I shall produce from the same perfor-
mance.
“ • One party had given their whole attention,
during several years, to the project of enriching
themselves, and impoverishing the rest of the na-
tion; and by these and other means, of establish-
ing their dominion under the government, and with
the favour of a family who were foreigners; and
therefore might believe that they were established
on the throne, by the good will and strength of
this party alone.'
“The criterion of such loose sentences is as fol-
lows: There will always be found in them one
place at least before the end, at which if you make
a stop, the construction of the preceding part will
render it a complete sentence: thus, in the ex-
ample now given, whether you stop at the word
themselves, at nation, at dominion, at government,
or at foreigners, all which words are marked in the
quotation in italics, you will find you have read a
perfect sentence."
The true distinction, then, between a period and
a loose sentence, is, that
A period is an assemblage of such words, or
members, as do not form sense independent on
each other; or if they do, the former modify the
latter, or inversely; and that
A loose sentence, is an assemblage of such
words, or members, as do form sense, independent

of those that follow, and at the same time are not
modified by them :
A period, or compact sentence, therefore, is
divisible into two kinds; the first, which, for dis-
tinction sake, we may call
A direct period, is where the former words and
members depend for sense on the latter, as in the
following sentence ;
“ As we cannot discern the shadow moving
along the dial-plate, so the advances we make in
learning are only perceived by the distance gone
over.”
The second kind of period, or compact sentence,
which we may call
An inverted period, is that, where, though the
first part forms sepse without the latter, it is, never-
theless, modified by it; as in the following sentence:
“ There are several arts which all men are in
some measure masters of, without being at the pains
of learning them.”
A loose sentence has its former members form-
ing sense, without being modified by the latter;
as in the following sentence :
“ Persons of good taste expect to be pleased at
the same time they are informed; and think that
the best sense always deserves the best language."
In the above example, we find the latter mem-
ber adding something to the former, but not modi-
fying or altering it.
Sentences being thus defined, and distinguished
into their several kind, we shall be better enabled
to give such rules for dividing them by pauses, as
will reduce punctuation to some rational and
steady principles. Previously, however, to these
rules, it will be necessary to observe, that as the
times of the pauses are exceedingly indefinite, the
fewer distinctions we make between them, the
less we shall embarrass the reader. It, therefore,
seems eligible, to reduce the number of pauses to
three; namely, the smaller pause, answering to
of
€

RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
the comma; the greater pause, answering to the
semicolon or colon; and the greatest pause, an-
swering to the period. And as the division of a
sentence depends necessarily on its structure, and
the greater or less connexion of its parts, it will
be proper to begin with the direct period ; that
is, where no sense is formed till the sentence is
concluded.
RULE I.
Every direct period consists of two principal
constructive parts, between which parts the greater
pause must be inserted : when these parts com-
mence with conjunctions that correspond with
each other, they are sufficiently distinguishable,
as in the following sentence:
“ As we cannot discern the shadow moving along the
dial-plate, so the advances we make in knowledge are
only perceived by the distance gone over."
Here we may observe, that the first constructive
part begins with as, and the second with so: the
expectation is excited by the former, and an-
swered by the latter: at that point, therefore,
wbere the expectation begins to be answered, and
the sense begins to form, the principal pause is to
be used; and by this means, the two contrasted
and correspondent parts are distinctly viewed by
the mind.
A period may be direct, and its parts as neces-
sarily connected, where only the first conjunction
is expressed.
“ As in my speculations I have endeavoured to ex-
tinguish passion and prejudice, I am still desirous of do-
ing some good in this particular."-Spectator.
Here the word so is understood before I am,
and the long pause as much required, as if so had
been expressed ; since it is here the sentence

37
naturally divides into two correspondent and de-
pendent parts.
That point, therefore, where the expectation be-
gins to be answered, or where one part of the
sentence begins to modify the other, is the point
which we must be the most careful to mark; as
it is here the sentence naturally divides into its
principal constructive parts.
RULE II.
Every inverted period consists of two princi-
pal constructive parts, between which parts the
greater pause must be inserted : these parts
divide at that point, where the latter part of the
sentence begins to modify the former; in periods
of this kind, the latter conjunction only is expres-
sed, as in the example :
Every one that speaks and reasons is a grammarian
and a logician ; though he may be utterly unacquainted
with the rules of grammar, or logic, as they are delivered
in books and systems."
If we invert this period, we shall find it sus-
ceptible of the two correspondent conjunctions,
though and yet; as, “Though utterly unacquaint-
ed with the rules of grammar or logic, as delivered
in books and systems, yet every man who speaks
and reasons is a grammarian and a logician."
This inversion of the order of a sentence, is,
perhaps, the best criterion of the connexion of its
parts; and proves that the former, though form-
ing complete sense by itself, is modified by the
latter. Thus in the phrases, “ Christ died for him,
because he died for all.”_" Many things are be-
lieved, though they exceed the capacity of our
wits.”-Hooker.
In these phrases, if we but transpose the noun
and pronoun, and invert the order, the sentences will
be perfectly the same in sense, and the connexion
E.

RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
will be more apparent; as, “Because Christ died
for all, he died for him.”_" Though many things
exceed the capacity of our wits, they are believed.”
RULE III.
EVERY loose sentence consists of a period,
either direct or inverted, and an additional mem-
ber, which does not modify it; or, in other words,
a loose sentence is a member containing perfect
sense by itself, followed by some other member
or members, which do not restrain or qualify
its signification. According to this definition, a
loose sentence requires a pause between the prin-
cipal constructive parts of the period, and between
the period and the additional member.
Example.
Persons of good taste expect to be pleased, at the same
time they are informed ; and think that the best sense
always deserves the best language.
In this sentence an inverted period is construct.
ed at the word informed; and, therefore, a pause
is required at pleased, because here the former
part of the sentence is modified by the latter: a
pause is likewise required at informed, because
here another member commences. Let us take
another example.
The soul, considered abstractedly from its passions, is
of a remiss and sedentary nature; slow in its resolves,
and languishing in its executions.--Spectator,
Here a direct period is formed at nature; the
principal constructive parts of this period separate
at passions, and here must be the larger pause :
the succeeding members are only additional, and
require a larger pause between them, and the
period they belong to, and a smaller pause be-
tween each other at resolves.

39
short pause.
Having thus given an idea of the principal
pause in a sentence, it will be necessary to say
something of the subordinate pauses, which inay
all be comprehended under what is called tho
And, first, it may be observed, that by the long
pause, is not meant a pause of any determinate
length, but the longest pause in the sentence.
When the sentence is divided into its principal
parts by the long pause, these parts, if complex,
are again divisible into subordinate parts by a
short pause; and these, if necessary, are again
divisible into more subordinate parts by a still
shorter pause, till, at last, we arrive at those
words which admit of no pause; as the article
and its substantive, the substantive and its adjec-
tive in their natural order, or, if unattended by ad-
juncts, in any order; and the prepositions and the
words they govern. These words are not divisible.
If, without necessity, we pause between other
words, the pronunciation will be only languid
and embarrassed; but between these a pause is
not only embarrassing, but unsuitable and repug-
nant to the sense.
The subordinate parts of sentences are easily
distinguished in such sentences as consist of parts
corresponding to parts, as in the following ex-
ample :
If impudence prevailed as much in the forum and
courts of justice, as insolence does in the country and
places of less resort; Aulus Cæcina would submit as
much to the inpudence of Sextus Æbutius in this cause,
as he did before to his insoleuce, when assaulted by
him.-Cicero.
Here the whole sentence readily divides into
two principal constructive parts at resort ; the
first part as readily divides into two subordi-
nate parts at justice; and the last, into two other
subordinate parts at cause ; and these are all

RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
the pauses necessary : but if, from the neces-
sity either of drawing breath, or of more strongly
enforcing every part of this sentence, we were to
admit of more pauses than those, it cannot be
denied, that for this purpose, some places more
readily admit of a pause than others. If, for in-
stance, the first subordinate part were to admit
of two pauses, they could no where be so suitably
placed as at impudence and forum; if the next
might be over-pointed in the same manner, the
points would be less unsuitable at does and coun-
try than at any other words; in the same manner,
a pause might be more tolerable at Cecina, and
Æbutius, and at before, and insolence, than in any
other of the subordinate parts of the latter division
of this sentence,
The parts of loose sentences which admit of
the short pause, must be determined by the same
principles. If a loose sentence has been properly
defined, it consists of a clause containing perfect
sense, followed by an additional clause which
does not modify it. Thus in the following ex-
ample:
Foolish men are more apt to consider what they have
lost, than what they possess; and to turn their eyes on
those who are richer than themselves, rather than on those
who are under greater difficulties.
Here a perfect sentence is formed at possess, and
here must be the longest pause, as it intervenes
between two parts nearly independent: the prin-
cipal pause in the first member of this sentence,
which may be called a subordinate pause respect-
ing the whole sentence, is at lost, and that of the
last member, at themselves: if, for the sake of pre-
cision, other and shorter pauses were admitted,
it should seem most suitable to admit them at
men and consider in the first member, at eyes and
those in the first part of the second member, and
at those in the last. It must, however, be care-

41
fully understood that this multiplicity of shorter
pauses is not recommended as necessary or pro-
per, but only as possible, and to be admitted oc-
casionally : and, to draw the line as much as pos-
sible between what is necessary and unnecessary,
we shall endeavour to bring together such parti-
cular cases as demand the short pause, and those
where it cannot be admitted without injuring either
the sense or the delivery.
RULE IV.
WHEN a nominative consists of more words
than one, it is necessary to pause after it.
When a nominative and a verb come in a sen-
tence unattended by adjuncts, no pause is neces-
sary for either the ear or the understanding; thus
in the following sentence:
Alexander wept :
No pause intervenes between these words, be-
cause they convey only two ideas, which are ap-
prehended the moment they are pronounced; but
if these be amplified by adjuncts of specification,
as in the following sentence:
The great and invincible Alexander, wept for the fate
of Darius :
Here a pause is necessary between these words,
not only that the organs may pronounce the whole
with more ease, but that the complex nominative
and verb may, by being separately and distinctly
exhibited, be more readily and distinctly con-
ceived.
This rule is so far from being unnecessary when
we are obliged to pause after the verb, that it then
becomes more essential.
Example.
This account of party patches will, I am afraid, ap-
pear improbable to those who live at a distance from the
fashionable world. --Spectator.

If in this sentence we pause only at will, ás
marked by the printer, we shall find the verb
swallowed up, as it were, by the nominative case,
and confounded with it; but if we make a short
pause both before and after it, we shall find every
part of the sentence obvious and distinct.
That the nominative is more separable from the
verb, than the verb from the objective case, is
plain from the propriety of pausing at self-love,
and not at forsook, in the following example:
Self-love forsook the path it first pursued,
And found the private in the public good.-Pope.
The same may be observed of the first line of
the following couplet.
Earth smiles around with boundless beauty blest,
And heaven beholds its image in his breast.-Ibid.
Here, though the melody invites to a pause at
beholds, propriety requires it at heaven.
RULE V.
WHATEVER member intervenes between the
nominative case and the verb, is of the nature of
a parenthesis, and must be separated from both of
them by a short pause.
Examples.
I am told that many virtuous matrons, who formerly
had been taught to believe that this artificial spotting of
a face was unlawful, are now reconciled, by a zeal for
their cause, to what they could not be prompted by a
concern for their beauty.-Spectator.
The member intervening between the nomina-
tive matrons and the verb are, may be considered
as incidental, and must therefore be separated
from both.

threatened both parties, and united them together in a firni
and lasting peace.-Ibid.
Here the member intervening between the no-
minative case women and the verb interposed, must
be separated from both by a short pause.
RULE VI.
WHATEVER member intervenes between the
verb and the accusative case, is of the nature of
a parenthesis, and must be separated from both
by a short pause.
Examples.
I knew a person who possessed the faculty of distin-
guishing flavours in so great a perfection, that, after bav-
ing tasted ten different kinds of tea, he would distinguish,
without seeing the colour of it, the particular sort which
was offered him.--Spectator.
The member intervening between the verb dis-
tinguish and the accusative case the particular
sort, must be separated from them by a short
pause.
A man of a fine taste in writing will discern, after the
same manner, not only the general beauties and imper-
fections of an author, but discover the several ways of
thinking and expressing himself, which diversify him from
all other authors.-Ibid.
The member intervening between the verb dis-
cern and the accusative case not only the general
beauties, must be separated from both by a short
pause.
RULE VII.
WHEN two verbs come together, and the latter
is in the infinitive mood, if any words come be-
tween, they must be separated from the latter verb
by a pause.

When the substantive verb to be is followed by
a verb in the infinitive mood, which may serve as
a nominative case to it, and the phrases before
and after the verb may be transposed, then the
pause falls between the verbs.
Examples.
The practice among the Turks is, to destroy, or im-
prison for life, any presumptive heir to the throne.
Their first step was, to possess themselves of Cæsar's
papers money, and the next, to convene the senate.
Goldsmith.
and
RULE VIII.
If there are several subjects belonging in the
same manner to one verb, or several verbs be-
longing in the same manner to one subject, the
subjects and verbs are still to be accounted equal
in number; for every verb must have its subject,
and every subject its verb; and every one of the
subjects, or verbs, should have its point of distinc-
tion and a short pause.
Example.
Riches, pleasure, and health, become evils to those
who do not know how to use them.
Here the subjects riches, pleasure, and health,
belong each of them to the verb become; as, “Riches
become an evil, pleasure becomes an evil, health
becomes an evil.” Each of these, therefore, must

be separated by a short pause; and all of them
forming only one compound nominative case,
must, according to Rule iv., be separated by a
short pause from the verb.
RULE IX.
If there are several adjectives belonging in the
same manner to one substantive, or several sub-
stantives belonging in the same manner to one ad-
jective, the adjectives and substantives are still to
be accounted equal in number; for every substan-
tive must have its adjective, and every adjective its
substantive; and every adjective coming after its
substantive, and every adjective coming before its
substantive, except the last, must be separated
by a short pause.
.
Example.
A polite, an active, and a supple behaviour, is neces-
sary to succeed in life.
In this example, behaviour, as was observed in
the foregoing rule, is understood to belong equally
to polite and active as to supple, and, consequent-
ly, every adjective has its correspondent substan-
tive; and as the adjectives come before the sub-
stantive, every one but that which immediately
precedes its substantive, is separated by a pause.
The punctuation is different in the following
sentence:
A behaviour, active, supple, and polite, is necessary
to succeed in life.
In this example, as the substantive precedes the
adjective, every adjective is separated from the
substantive by a short pause.
RULE X.
If there are several adverbs belonging in the
same manner to one verb, or several verbs belong-
ing in the same manner to one adverb, the verbs

RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION,
and adverbs are still to be accounted equal in
number; and if the adverbs come after the verb,
they are each of them to be separated by a pause ;
but if the adverbs come before the verb, a pause
must separate each of them from the verb, except
the last.
Examples.
To love, wisely, rationally, and prudently, is, in the
opinion of lovers, not to love at all.
Wisely, rationally, and prudently to love, is, in the opi-
nion of lovers, not to love at all.
In the first example, the verb and adverb are
separated by a pause, for the verb to love excites
an idea which the mind may contemplate for a
moment, separately from the adverb which modi-
fies it ; and as this adverb is accompanied by
others, they form a class more united by simili-
tude with each other, than with the verb they
modify; and the distinguishing the word to which
they all relate by a pause, makes an equal relation
to each more distinct and apparent.
The reason why this separation does not take
place in the last example, is, that though modify-
ing words may be distinguished from each other,
they cannot be separated, even in idea, from the
words they modify, because they give the mind no
object to rest upon; and so intimately are they
always connected, that though the modified word
comes first, and, by this means, affords the mind
a momentary pause, yet no pause is admitted
between the modified, and the modifying word,
unless the latter is accompanied by other modify-
ing words, which then form a class apart, and re-
quire separation both from each other, and the
word they modify.
Thus, in the following examples :
To eat, drink, and sleep moderately, is greatly con-
ducive to health.


## p. 47 (#61) ##############################################

RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
47
Moderately to eat, drink, and sleep, is greatly con-
ducive to health.
We find that the adverb moderately, in the first
example, coming after the verb sleep, and unac-
companied by any other words, is not separated
from the verb by a pause, any more than when it
precedes the verb, as in the last example: but
every critical ear will admit of a pause between
the verb and adverb in the following lines in
Shakespeare's Othello :
Then must you speak
Of one, that lov’d, not wisely, but too well :
Because in this passage, the words, not wisely,
but too well, form a distinct class, and cannot be
distinctly apprehended but by being separated
from the verb they modify.
But when the adverb precedes the verb, it is
then in the same case as the adjective before the
substantive; and it is impossible to divide it from
the verb by a pause.
Examples.
This ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet, in his idle tire,
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
Howe'er repented after.--Shakespeare.
In this example, the adverb howe'er must neces-
sarily be classed with the verb it precedes, and,
consequently, a pause must be placed at dear.
To trace the ways
Of highest agents, deem'd however wise.--Milton.
Here the word however modifies the adjective
wise, and, therefore, is more closely united with
it, than with tho verb deem'd: and if this union
be not intimated by a short pause at deem'd, the
sense will be a little ambiguous; as we shall not
know whether these agents are extremely, or only
moderately wise.
But when this word is used conjunctively, that
is, when we may supply its place by substituting

nevertheless, notwithstanding, yet, or still, a pause
ought always to follow it.
In
your excuse your
love does little
say,
You might, howe'er, have took a fairer way.
Dryden.
Here the word howe'er is used conjunctively,
and a pause after it is highly necessary.
I do not build my reasoning wholly on the case of per-
secution; however, I do not exclude it.- Atterbury.
A pause in this sentence at however, manifestly
fixes and regulates the sense of it.
RULE XI.
WHATEVER words are put into the case abso-
lute, commonly called the “ Ablative Absolute,”
must be separated from the rest by a short pause.
Examples.
If a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt
or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely
make it good.--Old Testament.
Here, the owner thereof not being with it, is the
phrase called the ablative absolute; and this,
like a parenthesis, must be separated from the rest
of the sentence by a short pause on each side.
God, from the mount of Sinai, whose grey top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself,
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound,
Ordain them laws.--Milton.
Here he descending neither governs, nor is go-
verned by any other part of the sentence; and is
said to be in the ablative absolute, and this in-
dependence must be marked by a short pause be-
fore and after the clause.
RULE XII.
Nouns in apposition, or words in the same
case; where the latter is only explanatory of the
former, have a short pause between them, either

49
if both these nouns consist of many terms, or the
latter only.
Example.
When first thy sire, to send on earth
Virtue, his darling child, design'd;
To thee he gave the heavenly birth,
And bade thee form her infant mind.—Gray.
Here the word Virtue, and the following mem-
ber, may be said to be in apposition, and must be
divided by a short pause.
If the two nouns are single, no pause is admitted;
as: Paul the apostle; king George: but if the latter
consists of many terms, a short pause is neces-
sary; as, Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles;
George, king of Great Britain, France, and Ire-
land.
The reason of this seems to be the same with
that which permits us to pause between a sub-
stantive and adjective in the inverted order, when
the latter has adjuncts that form a class ; for
when nouns are in apposition, the latter, by quali-
fying the former, has the nature of an adjective,
and is, therefore, subject to the same laws of punc-
tuation.
RULE XIII.
Who and which, when in the nominative case,
and the pronoun that, when used for who or which,
require a short pause before them.
Example.
A man can never be obliged to submit to any power,
unless he can be satisfied, who is the person, who has a
right to exercise it.—Locke.
RULE XIV.
When that is used as a casual conjunction, it
ought always to be preceded by a short pause.'
Example.
I must, therefore, desire the reader to remember, that

by the pleasures of the imagination, I mean only such
pleasures as arise originally from sight.-Spectator.
RULE XV.
PREPOSITIONS and conjunctions are more
united with the words they precede, than with
those they follow; and, consequently, if it be ne-
cessary to pause, the preposition and conjunc-
tion ought to be classed with the succeeding words,
and not with the preceding.
Examples.
A violent passion, for universal admiration, produces
the most ridiculous circumstances, in the general beba-
viour, of women of the most excellent understanding.
We may pause four times in this sentence, if
necessary, without, in the least, injuring the sense:
that is, at passion, admiration, circumstances, and
behaviour, but if, instead of pausing at these
words, we were to pause at the words, for, pro-
duces, in, and of, which are the words immediate-
ly succeeding, we shall soon perceive to which
words the prepositions naturally belong.
Homer and Hesiod intimate to us how this art should
be applied, when they represent the Muses as surrounding
Jupiter, and warbling hymns about his throne.
In this example, the conjunction as, and the
copulative and, in the last clause, must necessarily
be classed with the succeeding, and not the prece-
ding words.
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Old Testament.
Here the conjunction except, naturally asso-
ciates with the latter part of the sentence, and
acquires a short pause before it.
When parenthetic words come between the
conjunction and the word to which it belongs, the
conjunction must have a pause both before and
after it.

Example.
This let him know,
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend
Surprisal.— Milton.
Here the parenthetic member wilfully transgres-
sing, requires a short pause before and after it.
When a preposition enters into the composi-
tion of a verb, it must have a pause after it.
Example.
People expect in a small essay, that a point of humour
should be worked up, in all its parts, and a subject touch-
ed upon, in its most essential articles, without the
repe-
titions, tautologies, and enlargements, that are indulged
to longer labours.-- Spectator.
In this sentence the preposition up is separated
from in, because it enters into the composition of
the verb work, as to work up forms one complex
verb; the same may be observed of the preposi-
tion upon, in the next clause of the sentence.
RULE XVI.
WHEN words are placed either in opposition
to, or in apposition with each other, the words so
placed, require to be distinguished by a pause.
Examples.
The pleasures of the imagination, taken in their full ex-
tent, are not so gross as those of sense, nor so refined as
those of the understanding.--Spectator.
It must be acknowledged by every judicious
ear, that a short pause at gross, and another at
refined, tend materially to elucidate the sentence.
Some place the bliss in action, some in ease;
Those call it pleasure, and contentment these.. Pope.

tentment in the second, tend greatly to place the
sense in a clear and distinct point of view.
When one object is successively contrasted
with another, though each of them forms the no-
minative case to the verb, and consists but of a
single word, it is necessary to pause after each,
in order to show the contrast more distinctly.
Example.
At the same time that I think discretion the most use-
ful talent a man can be master of, I look upon cuoning
to be the accomplishment of little, mean, ungenerous
minds. Discretion points out the noblest ends to us, and
pursues the most proper and laudable methods of at-
taiping them : Cunning has only selfish aims, and sticks
at nothing which may make them succeed. Discretion
has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed
eye, commands a whole horizon : Cunning has a kind of
short-sightedness, that discovers the minutest objects that
are near at hand, but is not able to discern things at a
distance. Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives a
greater authority to the person who possesses it: Cunning,
when it is once detected, loses its force, and makes a man
incapable of bringing about even those events which he
might have done, had be passed only for a plain man.
Discretion is the perfection of reason, and a guide to
us in all the duties of life: Cunning is a kind of instinct,
that only looks out after our immediate interest and wel-
fare. Discretion is found only in men of strong sense and
good understandings : Cunning is often to be met with in
brutes themselves, and in persons who are but the fewest
removes from them: in short, Cunning is only the mimic
of Discretion, and may pass upon weak men, in the same
manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and gravity
for wisdom.-Spectator.
In this passage much of the force and precision
of the contrast between discretion and cunning,
would be lost without a sensible pause after each.
The necessity of distinguishing opposite or
contrasted parts in a sentence, will sometimes
oblige us to separate words that are the most in-
timately connected.

Example.
To suppose the zodiac and planets to be efficient of,
and antecedent to themselves,would be absurd.-- Bentley.
Here the prepositions of and to are in opposi-
tion to each other, and both connected intimately
with the word themselves; but this connexion does
not preclude the necessity of a pause after each,
to show their distinct and specific relation to
their governing words, and their equal relation to
the common word themselves.
RULE XVII.
WHATEVER words constitute the case govern-
ed by time, must be marked with a short pause,
both before and after them.
Example.
In the long retrospect of your journey, you have seen,
every day, the shades of the evening fall, and, every
year, the clouds of winter gather. But you
have seen
also, every succeeding day, the morning arise in its bright-
ness; and, every succeeding year, the spring return to
renovate the winter of nature. -Alison.
If in the first sentence, the phrases every day and
every year, each of which is the case governed by
time, he not distinguished by pauses from the rest
of the sentence, each of them may be mistaken
for the objective case governed by the verb have
seen. The same observation will hold good with
regard to the phrases, every succeeding day, and
every succeeding year, in the last sentence.
RULE XVIII.
WHEN a word or words are omitted by the fi-
gure ellipsis, a pause is necessary where the ellipsis

Example.
Let the young and the brave of our people go forth,
and pour around our isle a living barrier to injustice
and ambition : and when that tide of anarchy which has
overflowed the world, rolls its last waves to our shores,
let them show to the foe as impenetrable a front as the
rocks of our land to the storms of the ocean.-Alison.
In this sentence the words the rocks of our land,
form the nominative case to the verb show under-
stood, and, therefore, require a pause after them.
RULE XIX.
The words but and for, when used as conjunc-
tions, and followed by nouns or pronouns, should
have a short pause after them, to distinguish them
from prepositions governing the objective case.
Example.
Who is here so base, that would be a bondman? Ifany,
speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude,
that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have
I offended. Who is here so vile, that will pot love his
country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I
pause for a reply.--Brutus, on the Death of Cæsar.
If in this sentence, a pause be not placed after
the conjunction for, as often as it occurs, it will
seem to be a preposition governing the succeed-
ing word him, which is really governed by the
verb offended ; and the meaning will be, that
Brutus has offended for the sake of that person,
and not against him.
V
Introduction to the Theory of the Inflections of the
Voice.
BESIDES the pauses, which indicate a greater
or less separation of the parts of a sentence and
a conclusion of the whole, there are certain in-
flections of voice, accompanying these pauses,
which are as necessary to the sense of the sentence
as the pauses themselves : for, however exactly


## p. 55 (#69) ##############################################

INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
55
we may pause between those parts which are
separable, if we do not pause with such an in-
flection of voice as is suited to the sense, the
composition we read will not only want its true
meaning, but will have a meaning very different
from that intended by the writer.
The vast variety of tone which a good reader
or speaker throws into delivery, and of which it
is impossible to convey any idea but by imitation,
has easily led us to suppose, that nothing at all
of this variety can be defined and reduced to rule :
but when we consider, that, whether words are
pronounced in a high or a low, in a loud or a soft
tone ; whether they are pronounced swiftly, or
slowly, forcibly, or feebly, with the tone of pas-
sion, or without it; they must necessarily be pro-
nounced sliding either upwards or downwards,
or else go into a monotone, or song; we shall find,
that the primary division of speaking sounds is
into the upward and the downward slide of the
voice; and that whatever other diversity of time,
tone, or force, is added to speaking, it must
necessarily be conveyed by these two slides.
These two slides, or inflections of voice, there-
fore, are the axes, as it were, on which the force,
variety, and harmony of speaking turn.
Method of explaining the Inflections of the Voice.
It must first be premised, that by the rising or the
falling inflection, is not meant the pitch of voice
in which the whole word is pronounced, or that
loudness or softness wbich may accompany any
pitch ; but that upward or downward slide which
the voice makes when the pronunciation of a
word is finishing; and which may, therefore, not
improperly be called the rising and the falling
inflection.
The effect of these inflections is very observ-
able in reading a sentence, when we have mis-


## p. 56 (#70) ##############################################

56
INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
taken the connexion between the members, either
by supposing, that the sense is to be continued
when it finishes, or supposing it finished, when it
is really to be continued; for in either of these
cases, before we have pronounced the last word,
we find it necessary to return pretty far back to
some of the preceding words, in order to give
them such inflections, as are suitable to those
which the sense requires on the succeeding words.
Thus, in pronouncing the speech of Portius in
Cato, which is generally mis-pointed, as in the
following example :
Remember wbat our father oft has told us,
The
ways
of heav'n are dark and intricate,
Puzzled in mazes and perplexed in errors;
Our understanding traces them in vain,
Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless search :
Nor sees with how much art the windings run,
Nor where the regular confusion ends.
If, from not having considered this passage, we
run the second line into the third, by suspending
the voice at intricate in the rising inflection, and
dropping it at errors, in the falling, we find a very
improper meaning conveyed; and if, in recover-
ing ourselves from this improper pronunciation,
we take notice of the different manner in which we
pronounce the second and third lines, we shall
find, that not only the last word of these lines,
but that every word, alters its inflection ; for,
when we perceive that by mistaking the pause,
we have misconceived the sense, we find it neces-
sary to begin the line again, and to pronounce
every word differently, in order to make it har-
monious.
In order to make this different inflection of voice
the more easily apprehended, the following direc-
tions will be useful. Let us suppose we are to
pronounce the following sentence:
Does Cæsar deserve fame, or blame?


## p. 57 (#71) ##############################################

INFLECTIONS OF THE VOICE.
57
If the reader will but narrowly watch the sounds
of the words fame and blame, he will have an ex-
ample of the two inflections here spoken of; fame
will have the rising, and blame the falling inflec-
tion.
Every pause, of whatever kind, must necessa-
rily adopt one of these two inflections, or continue
in a monotone : thus, when we ask a question
without the interrogative words, we naturally
adopt the rising inflection on the last word; as,
Can Cæsar deserve blame? Impossible!
Here blame, the last word of the question, has the
rising inflection, and impossible, with the note of
admiration, the falling. The comma, or that sus-
pension of voice generally annexed to it, which
marks a continuation of the sense, is most fre-
quently accompanied by the rising inflection, as
in the falling sentence:
If Cæsar deserves blame, he ought to have no fame.
Here we find that the word blame, marked with
the comma, has exactly the same inflection of voice
as the same word in the interrogative sentence
immediately preceding; the only difference is,
that the rising inflection slides higher at the in-
terrogation, than at the comma.
The three other points, namely, the semicolon,
colon, and period, adopt either the rising or the
falling inflection, as the sense or harmony requires.
Perhaps the best method of knowing whether
we make use of the inflection we intend, is, to form
it into a question with the disjunctive or.
Thus in the following sentence :
A contented mind, and a good conscience, will make
a man happy in all conditions.
In order to pronounce this sentence to the best

advantage, it will be necessary to lay the falling
inflection on the word mind, the rising on con-
science, and the falling on all. If I would know the
falling inflection I am to lay on mind, let me form
the word into this question, Is it mind, or mind ?
If I want to know the rising inflection on con-
science, I must say Is it conscience or conscience? the
falling inflection on all will be determined by say-
ing, Is it all, or all ?
The rising inflection is denoted by the acute
accent, thus (').
The falling inflection is denoted by the grave
accent, thus ).
Compact Sentence.
DIRECT PERIOD.
RULE I.
Every direct period, so constructed as to
have its two principal constructive parts con-
nected by correspondent conjunctions, requires
the long pause with the rising inflection, at the
end of the first principal constructive member.
Examples.
As we cannot discern the shadow moving along the
díal-plate, so the advances we make in knowledge are
only perceived by the distance gone over.
As we perceive the shadow to have moved, but did not
perceive it moving; so our advances in learning, consist-
ing of insensible steps, are only perceived by the dis-
tance.
As we perceive the shadow to have moved along the
dial, but did not perceive it moving; and it appears that
the grass has grown, though nobody ever saw it grow :
so the advances we make in knowledge, as they consist
of such minute steps, are only perceivable by the distance.
Each of these three sentences consists of two

COMPACT SENTENCE.
59
principal correspondent parts ; the first part com-
mencing with as, and the last with so. As the
first part of the first sentence is a simple member,
it is marked with only a comma at dial-plate ; as
the first part of the second sentence is a com-
pound member, it is marked with a semicolon at
moving; and as the first part of the last sentence
is decompounded, it is marked with a colon at
grow. This punctuation is according to the ge-
neral rules of pausing ; but whatever may be
the time taken up in pausing at the different
points, the inflection annexed to them must al-
ways be the same; that is, the comma, semico-
lon, and colon, must invariably have the rising
inflection in sentences thus constructed.
The same may be observed of the following sen-
tences:
Although I fear it may be a shame to be dismayed at
the entrance of my discourse in defence of a most valiant
man; and that it no way becomes me, while Milo is
more concerned for the safety of the state than for him-
self, not to show the same greatness of mind in his be-
hálf; yet this new form of prosecution terrifies my eyes,
which, whatever way they turn, want the ancient custom of
the forum, and the former manner of trials.-Cicero.
Althoug son Marcus, as you have now been a hearer
of Cratippus for a year, and this at Athens, you ought to
abound in the precepts and doctrines of philosophy, by
reason of the great character both of your instructor and
the city; one of which can furnish you with knowledge,
and the other with examples; yet, as I always to my ad-
vantage joined the Latin tongue with the Greek, and I have
done it not only in oratory, but likewise in philosophy;
I think you ought to do the same, that you may be equally
conversant in both languages.-Cicero.
These sentences begin with the concessive con-
junction although, and have their correspondent
conjunction yet ; and these conjunctions form the
two principal constructive members. The words

members, must have the rising inflection, and here
must be the long pause.
RULE II.
Every direct period, consisting of two princi-
pal constructive parts, and having only the first
part commencing with a conjunction, requires the
rising inflection and long pause at the end of this
part.
Examples.
As in my speculations I have endeavoured to extin-
guish passion and préjudice, I am still desirous of doing
some good in this particular.--Spectator.
Here the sentence divides itself into two cor-
respondent parts at prejudice; and as the word
so is understood before the words I am, they
must be preceded by the long pause and rising in-
flection.
If impudence prevailed as much in the forum and courts
of justice, as insolence does in the country and places of
less resort; Aulus Cæcina would submit as much to the
impudence of Sextus Æbutius in this cause, as he did
before to his insolence, when assaulted by him.-Cicero.
If I have any genius, which I am sensible can be but
very small; or any readiness in speaking, in which I do
not deny but I have been much conversant; or any skill
in oratory, from an acquaintance with the best arts, to
which I confess I have been always inclined: no one
has a better right to demand of me the fruit of all these
things than Aulus Licinius.—Cicero.
If, after surveying the whole earth at once, and the se-
veral planets that lie within its neighbourhood, we con-
template those wild fields of ether, that reach in height as
far as from Saturn to the fixed stars, and run abroad, al-
most to an infinitude; our imagination finds its capacity
filled with so immense a prospect, and puts itself upon
the stretch to comprehend it.-Spectator.

In the first of these examples, the first part of
the sentence ends at resort, and the second begins
at Aulus Cecina: in the second sentence, the first
part ends at inclined, and the second begins at no
one;' and in the third, the first part ends at in-
finitude, and the second begins at our : between
these words, therefore, in each sentence, must be
inserted the long pause, and rising inflection.
All these sentences commence with a conjunc-
tion, and may be said to have a correspondent
conjunction commencing the second part of the
sentence, not expressed, but understood. In the
first sentence, commencing with it, then is under-
stood at the beginning of the second part; the
sense of this conjunctive adverb then, may be
plainly perceived to exist, by inserting it in the
sentence, and observing its suitableness when ex-
pressed :
If impudence prevailed as much in the forum and courts
of justice, as insolence does in the country and places of
less resort; then Aulus Cæcina would submit as much to
the impudence of Sextus Æbutius in this cause, as he did
before to his insolence when assaulted by him.
The same insertion of the word then might be
made in the two last examples, commencing with
if, and the same suitableness would appear.
The exception to this rule is, when the em-
phatical word in the conditional part of the sen-
tence is in direct opposition to another word in
the conclusion, and a concession is implied in
the former, in order to strengthen the argument in
the latter; for in this case, the middle of the
sentence has the falling, and the latter member the
rising inflection.
Examples.
If we have no regard for religion in youth, we ought
to have some regard for it in áge.
If we have no regard for our own character, we ought
to have some regard for the character of others.

COMPACT SENTENCE.
In these examples, we find the words youth and
own character, have the falling inflection, and both
periods end with the rising inflection; but if these
sentences bad been formed so as to make the
latter member a mere inference from, or conse-
quence of the former, the general rule would have
taken place.
Examples.
If we have no regard for religion in youth, we have
seldom any regard for it in age.
If we have no regard for our own character, it can
scarcely be expected, that we should have any regard for
the character of others.
RULE III.
DIRECT periods which commence with partici-
ples of the present and past tense, consist of two
parts; between wbich must be inserted the long
pause and rising inflection.
Example
Having already shown how the fancy is affected by
the works of nature, and afterwards considered in general
both the works of nature and of art, how they mutually
assist and complete each other, in forming such scenes
and prospects as are most apt to delight the mind of the
beholder; I shall in this paper throw together some re-
flections on that particular art, which has a more imme-
diate tendency than any other, to produce those primary
pleasures of the imagination, which have hitherto been
the subject of this discourse.—Spectator.
The sense is suspended in this sentence, till
the word beholder, and here is to be placed the
long pause and rising inflection; in this place,
also, it is evident, the word now might be inserted
in perfect conformity to the sense.
Exception.
When the last word of the first part of sentences
of this kind requires the strong emphasis, the fall-
ing infection must be used instead of the rising.

LOOSE SENTENCE.
63
Example.
Hannibal being frequently destitute of money and pro-
visions, with no recruits of strength, in case of ill fortune,
and no encouragement even when succèssful; it is not to
be wondered at that his affairs began at length to decline.'
Goldsmith.
In this sentence, the phrase even when success-
fül, demands the strong emphasis, and must, there-
fore, be pronounced with the falling inflection.
Inverted Period.
EVERY period, where the first part forms per-
fect sense by itself, but is modified by the latter,
has the rising inflection and long pausebetween
these parts, as in the direct period.
Examples.
Gratian
very
often recommends the fine taste, as the
utmost perfection of an accomplished man.
In this sentence, the first member ending at
taste, forms perfect sense, but is qualified by the
the last; for Gratian is not said simply to recom-
mend the fine taste, but to recommend it, as the
utmost perfection of an accomplished man.
Persons of good taste expect to be pleased, at the same
time they are informed.
Here perfect sense is formed at pleased; but
it is not meant that persons of good taste are
pleased in general, but with reference to the time
they are informed.
In these sentences, therefore, we must pro-
nounce the words taste and pleased, with the rising
inflection, and accompany this inflection with a
panse.

A LOOSE sentence has been shown to consist
of a period, either direct or inverted, and an ad-

with us,
ditional member which does not modify it. Ac-
cordingly, every member of a sentence forming
consistent sense, and followed by two other mem-
bers which do not modify or restrain its significa-
tion, admits of the falling inflection, accompanied
with a long pause.
Examples.
The soul, considered abstractedly from its passions, is
of a remiss and sedentary nature, slow in its resolves,
and languishing in its executions.—Spectator.
The faculty (taste) must, in some degree, be born
and it

In short to cut off all cavilling against the ancients,

and in the colder regions of the world ; where we would
make some amends for our want of force and spirit, by a
scrupulous nicety and exactness in our compositions.

ANTITHETIC MEMBER.
65
In these sentences we find, that each of the
words marked with tbe falling inflection, con-
cludes a member which forms consistent sense,
and is not modified by those that follow.
Antithetic Member,
WHEN sentences have two parts corresponding
with each other, so as to form an antithesis, the
first part must always terminate with the rising
inflection.
Examples.
We are always complaining that our days are féw, and
acting as though there should be no end of them.
Spectator.
I imagined that I was admitted into a long spacious
gallery, which had one side covered with pieces of all the
famous painters who are now living; and the other with
the greatest masters who are dead. Ibid.
The wicked may, indeed, taste a malignant kind of
pleasure, in those actions to which they are accustomed
whilst in thís life ; but when they are removed from all
those objects which are here apt to gratify them, they will
naturally become their own tormentors.--Ibid.
The pleasures of the imagination are not so gross as
those of sénse, nor so refined as those of the understand
ing.--Ibid.
In all these examples, the first part of every
antithesis might form a perfect sentence by itself;
but the mutual relation between the former and
latter part, forms as necessary a connexion be-
tween them, as if the former part formed no sense
by itself, and the latter part modified and restrained
the sense of the former; and, therefore, the word
few in the first example, the word sense in the se-
cond, the word living in the third, and the words
this life in the fourth, must necessarily adopt the
rising inflection. For the same reason, the same

inflection must take place at the word succeed in
the following example :
Cicero concludes his celebrated books de Oratore,
with some precepts for pronunciation and action ; with-
out which part, he affirms, that the best orator in the
world can never succéed; and an indifferent one, who is
master of this, shall gain much greater applause.
Spectator.
Penultimate Member.
An exception to the foregoing rules forms ano-
ther rule, which forbids us, without necessity, to
adopt the falling inflection on the last member
but one. This rule is founded on the natural
perception of harmony in the ear, for as the last
member must almost always be terminated by the
falling inflection at the period, a falling inflection
immediately preceding it in the penultimate mem-
ber, would be too sudden a repetition of nearly
similar sounds : hence arises the propriety of the
following rules :
RULE I.
Every member of a sentence immediately pre-
ceding the last, requires the rising inflection.
Examples.
Aristotle tells us, that the world is a copy or transcript
of those ideas which are in the mind of the first Béing ;
and that those ideas which are in the mind of man, are a
transcript of the world: to this we may add, that words
are the transcript of those ideas which are in the mind of
mán, and that writing or painting is the transcript of
words.
In this example, if there were no connexion
between the two last members, from the antithesis
they contain, the rising inflection would be neces-
sary at the end of the penultimate member for the
sake of sound.


## p. 67 (#81) ##############################################

PENULTIMATE MEMBER.
67
In short, a modern Pindaric writer, compared with
Pindar, is like a sister among the Camisars, compared
with Virgil's Sybil: there is the distortion, grimace, and
outward figure, but nothing of that divine impulse which
raises the mind above itself, and makes the sounds more
than human.-Spectator.
The florist, the planter, the gardener, the husbandman,
when they are accomplishments to the man of fortune, are
great reliefs to a country life, and many ways useful to
those who are possessed of them.-Ibid.
In the first of these examples, the sentence
might bave finished at itself, and in the last at life;
for the succeeding members do not modify them,
but as they are penultimate members, they neces-
sarily require the rising inflection.
He has annexed a secret pleasure to the idea of any
thing that is new or uncommon, that he might encourage
us in the pursuit after knowledge, and engage us to search
into the wonders of his creation ; for every new idea
brings such a pleasure along with it, as rewards any
pains we have taken in the acquisition, and consequently
serves as a motive to put us upon fresh discoveries.
Ibid.
In this example, we see that it is not the per-
fect sense of a member which alone qualifies it for
the falling inflection; it must be followed by one
member at least which does not admit this pause;
otherwise it is transferred from the first to the
succeeding member, which is the case in this ex-
ample. The first compound member forms per-
fect sense at knowledge, and the succeeding mem-
ber is not necessarily connected with it: but as
this member forms perfect sense likewise, and is
followed by one, which cannot be united with it
by the comma or rising inflection; therefore, to
avoid the ill effect of two successive pauses ex-
actly the same, the falling inflection must be
placed on the word creation.


## p. 68 (#82) ##############################################

68
PENULTIMATE MEMBER.
RULE II.
As a farther illustration of this, we may ob-
serve, that when the first member forms perfect
sense, and is followed by two members necessa-
rily connected, the falling inflection must be placed
on the first.
It shall ever be my study to make discoveries of this
nature in human life, and to settle the
proper distinctions
between the virtues and perfections of mankind, and those
false colours and resemblances of them that shine alike in
the eyes of the vulgar.--Addison.
In this example, we may observe that the fall-
ing inflection might have been placed on the se-
cond member, if the second and third members had
not been necessarily connected by an antithesis ;
which shows that the falling inflection requires
the member it is placed on, not only to have per-
fect sense independent on the succeeding mem-
ber, but, at the same time, requires the succeeding
member to be dependent on a third.
Exception.
Emphasis, which controls every other rule in
reading, forms an exception to this; which is, that
where an emphatic word is in the first member of
a sentence, and the last has no cmphatical word,
this penultimate member then terminates with the
falling inflection.
Examples.
I must therefore desire the reader to remember, that
by the pleasures of the imagination, I meant only such
pleasures as arise originally from sight; and that I di-
vide these pleasures into two kinds. Spectator.
In this sentence the word sight is emphatical,
and, therefore, though in the penultimate mem-
ber, must not have the rising, but the falling in-
flection, as this is the inflection best suited to the
sense of the emphatic phrase.


## p. 69 (#83) ##############################################

SERIES.
69
The person he chanced to see was, to appearance, an
old, sordid, blind man; but upon his following him from
place to place, he at last found, by his own confession,
that he was Plutus, the God of Riches; and that he was
just come out of the house of a miser.-Spectator.
In this sentence the words God of Riches, as op-
posed to the words, old, sordid, blind man, are
emphatical, and, therefore, though in the penul-
timate member, require the falling inflection.
As a corollary to the former rules, it follows,
that when a loose sentence, having one member
forming perfect sense, and not modified by what
follows, is succeeded by another member, which
forms perfect sense likewise, unmodified by suc-
ceeding members; it ought to be marked with a
semicolon, or colon, and pronounced like a series,
with the falling inflection.
Example.
This persuasion of the truth of the Gospel, without the
evidence which accompanies it, would not have been so
firm and so dùrable ; it would not have acquired new
force with age ; it would not have resisted the torrent of
time, and have passed from age to age to our own days. :'
In this example a perfect sentence might be
formed at durable ; and as it is not modified by
what follows, it ought to have the falling inflec-
tion: a perfect sentence might also be formed at
age; which being under the same predicament as
the former member, requires the falling inflection
likewise: a sentence, in the same manner, might
be formed at time; but as this is the penultimate
member, it must necessarily adopt the rising in-
flection, according to the rule laid down in the pre-
ceding article.
Series.
As variety is necessary in the delivery of al-
most every separate portion of a sentence, it must


## p. 70 (#84) ##############################################

SERIES.
be much more so, where the sentence is so con-
structed that perfectly similar portions succeed
each other to a considerable number. Nothing,
however, can be more various than the
pronun-
ciation of a series. Almost every different pum-
ber of particulars requires a different method of
varying them; and even those of precisely the
same number of particulars, admit of a different
mode of pronunciation, as the series is either
commencing or concluding, simple or compound;
with many other varieties too complex to be easi-
ly determined.
In the first place, then, we may observe that
whenever we enumerate particulars with empha-
sis, or more than ordinary precision, we are apt
to give some of the first, at least, such a tone as
marks not only a distinct enumeration, but a com-
plete one: that is, the voice falls into such a
tone as shows each particular article of enumera-
tion to be completed, but not the whole number.
In the pronunciation of sentences of this kind,
the similar members would naturally adopt the
falling inflection, which inflection not only dis-
tinguishes and enforces each particular taken se-
parately, but preserves the idea of a collective
whole.
But the nature as well as use of this inflection,
will, perhaps, be better understood by the follow-
ing example :
I tell you, though you, though all the world, though
an angel from heaven, were to affirm the truth of it, I
could not believe it.
First, let us try this passage with the rising in-
flection on each particular.
I tell you, though you, though all the world, though
an angel from héaven, were to affirm the truth of it, I
could not believe it.
How tame and insipid is this asseveration, in


## p. 71 (#85) ##############################################

SERIES.
71
comparison with the following manner of deliver-
ing it, that is with the falling inflection on each
particular.
I tell you, though you, though all the world, though
an angel from hèaven, were to affirm the truth of it, I
could not believe it.
The necessity of adopting this inflection in the
series will be still more apparent, by repeating
another passage both with and without it. And
first let us try the example by pronouncing it with
the rising inflection on every member.
The descriptive part of this allegory is likewise very
strong, and full of sublime ideas ;-the figure of Death,
the regal crown upon his head, his menace of Satan, his
advancing to the combat, the outcry at his bírth, are cir-
cumstances too noble to be passed over in silence, and
extremely suitable to this king of terrors.
Now let us pronounce each particular of this
series, but the last, with the falling inflection.
The descriptive part of this allegory is likewise very
strong, and full of sublime ideas; the figure of Death, the
regal crown upon his head, his menace of Satan, his ad-
vancing to the combat, the outcry at his birth, are cir-
cumstances too noble to be passed over in silence, and
extremely suitable to this king of terrors.
The difference of these two methods of pro-
nouncing this sentence is so obvious, as to leave
no doubt to which we shall give the preference.
But it may not be improper to remark, that in a
series of this kind, unless the language be very
emphatical, it is necessary to give the last arti-
cle of the series the rising inflection, as this is the
point when the sense begins to form.
Since every series requires different inflections,
as it either commences or concludes a sentence,
it may be necessary to observe, that by the name
of a commencing series, is meant that which begins

72
SIMPLE SERIES,
a sentence, but does not conclude it; and that by
the name of a concluding series, is meant that
which ends the sentence, whether it begins it or
not. Since a difference of inflection also takes
place upon the several members of a series, as
these members consist of one word, or more
words han one, it will not be improper to call
the series, whose members consist of single words,
a simple series ; and that whose members con-
sist of two or more words, a compound series.

When two members, consisting of single words,

WHEN three members of a sentence, consist-

An instance of the variety of inflection with
which a series of four particulars is pronounced,
and of the diversity of inflection which the series
requires, as it is either commencing or concluding,
will be greatly illustrated by the following ex-
ample :

hatred, màlice, anger, but is in constant possession of a
serene mind; he who follows the pleasutes of it, which
are in their very nature disappointing, is in constant

mencing series, is pronounced as in Rule 5; and
the last, as a concluding series, according to

COMPOUND SERIES.
75
These rules might be carried to a much greater
length; but too nice an attention to them, in a
long series, might not only be very difficult, but
give an air of stiffness to the pronunciation, which
would not be compensated by the propriety.
Compound Series.
Where the compound series commences, the
falling inflection takes place on every member
but the last; and when the series concludes, it
may take place on every member except the last
but one. It must be carefully noted, likewise,
that the second menuber ought to be pronounced
a little higher, and more forcibly than the first, the
third than the second, and so on; for which pur-
pose, if the members are numerous, it is evidently
necessary to pronounce the first member in so
low a tone, as to admit of rising gradually on the
same inflection to the last.
RULEJ.
When two commencing members of a sentence,
each of which consists of more than a single
word, are in succession, the first member must
terminate with the falling, and the last with the

Under this rule may be placed that grand and
terrible adjuration of Macbeth :

Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves

where by placing the falling inflection, without
dropping the voice, on each particular except the
last, and giving this inflection a degree of empha-
sis, increasing from the first member to the sixth,
we shall find the whole climax wonderfully enforced
and diversified.

The final Pause, or Period.
When a sentence is so far perfectly finished,
as not to be connected in construction with the
following sentence, it is marked with a period.
But though the tone, with which we conclude a
sentence, is generally well understood, we can-
not be too careful in pronunciation to distinguish
it as much as possible from that member of a
sentence, which contains perfect sense, and is not
necessarily connected with what follows. Such

a
a member requires the falling inflection, but in a
higher tone than the preceding words, as if we
had only finished a part of what we had to say ;
while the period' requires the falling inflection in
a lower tone, as if we had nothing more to add,
But this final tone does not only lower the last
word; it has the same influence on those which
more immediately precede the last; so that the ca-
dence is prepared by a gradual fall upon the con-
cluding words ; every word in the latter part of
sentence sliding gently lower, till the voice drops
upon the last,
Example.
As the word taste arises very often in conversation, I
shall endeavour to give some account of it, and to lay
dowu rules how we may know whether we are possèssed
of it, and how we may acquire that fine taste in writing
which is so much talked of among the polite world.
Spectator.
We find perfect sense formed at the words, ac-
count of it, and possessed of it; but as they do not
conclude the sentence, these words, if they adopt
the falling inflection, must be pronounced in a
higher tone than the rest; while in the last mem-
ber, not only the word world is pronounced lower
than the rest, but the whole member falls gradu-
ally into the cadence, which is so much talked of
among the polite world.
It must be observed,
however, that every period does not necessarily
adopt this inflection in the same tone of voice; if
sentences are intimately connected in sense, they
may not improperly be considered as so many
small sentences making one large one: hence it
may be laid down as a general rule, that a series
of periods in regular succession, are to be pro-
nounced as every other series; that is, if they fol-
low each other regularly as parts of the same ob-
servation, they are to be pronounced as parts, and
not as wholes.

INTERROGATION.
E.cample.
Some men cannot discern between a noble and a mean
action. Others are apt to attribute them to some false
end or intèntion, and others purposely misrepresent, or put
a wrong interpretation on them.
Though the first part of this passage is marked
with a period in all the editions of the Spectator,
nothing can be plainer than that it ought to be pro-
nounced as the first member of the concluding se-
ries of three compound members.
The period, though generally, does not alway's
require the falling inflection, and a lower tone of
voice. The first exception to the rule is the fol-
lowing:
Exception.
When a sentence concludes an antithesis, the
first branch of wbich requires the strong emphasis,
and therefore demands the falling inflection; the
second branch requires the weak emphasis and
the rising inflection.
Examples.
If we have no regard for our own character, we ought
to have some regard for the character of others.
If content cannot remove the disquietudes of mankind,
it will, at least, alléviate them.
I would have your papers consist also of all things which
may be necessary or useful to any part of society; and
the mechànic arts should have their place, as well as the

Interrogation.
The most obvions distinction between interro-
gative and other sentences, is, that as in other sen-
tences the substantive or pronoun precedes the
verb it governs; in an interrogative sentence, the


## p. 83 (#97) ##############################################

INTERROGATIVE WORDS.
83
verb, either auxiliary or principal, ought always
to precede the substantive or pronoun. Thus,
when I speak declaratively, I say, I am going to
college ; but when I speak interrogatively, I say,
Are you going to college ?
This inversion of the common order of the words
in composition, is accompanied by a similar in-
version of the inflection of voice in pronunciation;
for, as the common order of inflections in a decla-
rative sentence, is that of placing the rising in-
flection towards the middle, and the falling at the
end, as in the first example, the interrogation
inverts this order, and uses the falling inflection
of voice in the middle of the sentence, and the ri-
sing on the last word, as in the last example.
This inflection of voice, however, which dis-
tinguishes the interrogation, is entirely confined
to those questions which are formed without the
interrogative pronouns or adverbs.
With respect to pronunciation, all questions
may be divided into two classes; namely, into
such as are formed by the interrogative pronouns
or adverbs, and into such as are formed only by
an inversion of the common arrangement of the
words.
The Question with the Interrogative Words.
RULE I.
WHEN an interrogative sentence commences
with any of the interrogative pronouns or adverbs,
with respect to inflection, elevation, or depres-
sion of voice, it is pronounced exactly like a de-
clarative sentence.
Example.
How can he exalt his thoughts to any thing great and
noble, who only believes that after a short turn on the
stage of this world, he is to sink into oblivion, and to lose
his consciousness for ever.- Spectator.

84
INTERROGATIVE WORDS.
RULE II
INTERROGATIVE sentences commencing with
interrogative words, and consisting of members
in a series depending necessarily on each other
for sense, are to be pronounced as a series of
members of the same kind in a declaratiye sen-
tence.
Examples.
From whence can he produce such cogent exhortations
to the practice of every vìrtue, such ardent excitements
to piety and devotion, and such assistance to attain them,
as those which are to be met with throughout every page
of these inimitable writings?
Where, amidst the dark clouds of pagan philosophy,
can he show us such a clear prospect of a future state,
the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the dead,
and the general judgment, as in St. Paul's first epistle to
the Corinthians ?
In these sentences we find that exactly the
same pauses and inflections of voice take place as
in the different series of declarative sentences;
that the first example is to be pronounced as in
Rule 33 of the compound series, and the second
as in Rule 5. But the question which, in reading
or speaking, produces the greatest force and va-
riety, is that which is formed without the inter-
rogative words.
The Question without the Interrogative Words.
RULE 1.
When interrogative sentences are formed with-
out the interrogative words, the last word must
have the rising inflection. If there be an empha-
tical word in the last member followed by several
words depending on it, which conclude the sen-

INTERROGATIVE WORDS.
85
tence, both the emphatical word and the con-
cluding words are to be pronounced with the
rising inflection : thus the words making one, and
cause of the shipwreck, in the two following exam-
ples, have all the rising inflection.
Examples
Would it not employ a beau prettily enough, if, instead
of eternally playing with his snuff-box, he spent some
part of his time in making one !--Spectator.
If the owner of a vessel had fitted it out with every
thing necessary, and had provided to the utmost of his
power against the dangers of the sea, and that a storm
should afterwards arise, and break the masts,

shipwreck ?- Demosthenes.

RULE II.
When interrogative sentences, connected by the
disjunctive or, succeed each other, the first ends
with the rising, and the rest with the falling in-
flection.
Examples.
Shall we in your person crówn the author of the public
calamities, or shall we destroy him ?—Æschines.
Is the goodness, or wisdom of the divine Being, more
manifested in this his proceeding ?-Spectator.
RULE III.
INTERROGATIVE sentences without interroga-
tive words, when consisting of a variety of mem-
bers necessarily depending on each other for
sense, admit of every tone, pause, and inflection
of voice, common to other sentences, provided the
last member, on which the whole question de-
pends, has that peculiar elevation and inflection
of voice, which distinguish this species of interro-
gation,

INTERROGATIVE WORDS.
Example.
But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a per-
petual progress of improvements, and travelling on from
perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad
into the works of its Creator, and made a few discoveries
of his infinite goodness, wisdom, and power, must perish
at its first setting out, and in the very beginning of its
inquiries?
In reading this passage we shall find, that
placing the falling inflection without dropping the
voice on the words improvements and Creator, will
not only prevent the monotony which is apt to
arise from too long a suspension of the voice, but
enforce the sense, by enumerating the several par-
ticulars of which the question consists.
Example.
Do
you
think that Themistocles, and the heroes who
were killed in the battles of Marathon and Platèa; do
very
tombs of your ancestors will not send
forth groans, if you crown a man, who, by his own con-
fèssion, has been for ever conspiring with barbariaus to
ruin Greece ?
This passage will be rendered much more
forcible and harmonious, if, instead of suspending
the voice throughout, we make use of the falling
inflection', without dropping the voice, on the
words Platea and confession.

RULE IV,
INTERROGATIVE sentences formed without the
interrogative words, and consisting of members in
a series, which form perfect sense as they pro-
ceed, must have every member terminale with
the inflection of voice peculiar to this species of
interrogation.
Examples.
And with regard to the unhappy Lacedemonians, what
calamities have not befallen them for taking only a small
part of the spoils of the temple? they who formerly as-

sumed a superiority over Greece, are they not now going
to send ambassadors to Alexander's court, to bear the
name of hostages in his train, to become a spectacle of
mísery, to bow the knee before the monarch, submit
themselves and their country to his mércy, and receive
such laws as a conqueror,-a conqueror they attacked
first, shall think fit to prescribe them ?- Æschines.
But did
you,
0 (what title shall I give you !)
did you betray the least shadow of displeasure against
me, when I broke the chords of that harmony in your
presence, and dispossessed the commonwealth of the
advantages of that confederacy, which you magnify so
much with the loudest strains of your theatrical voice?
did
you
ascend the rostrum ? did you denounce, or once
explain those crimes, with which you are now pleased
to charge me ?- Demosthenes.
In this and the preceding sentence, we shall
find the ear relieved, and the sense greatly en-
forced, by placing the falling inflection with
emphasis in a high tone of voice on the words
conqueror, first, and explain, according to Rule 3.
The necessity of attending to the distinction of
inflection when things are distinguished from and
opposed to each other, will appear more clearly
from the following passage:
See Falkland dies, the virtuous and the just;
See god-like Turenne prostrate on the dust;
See Sydney bleeds amid the martial strife;
Was this their vírtue, or contempt of life?
If, in reading this passage, the voice were to
adopt the same inflection on virtue and on con-
tempt of life, and to end the last branch of the
question as well as the first with the rising inflec-
Lion, the distinction so strongly marked by the
sense would be lost.

tained in the words to wbich it is annexed: and,
therefore, when it is applied to sentences which,
from their form, might be supposed to be merely
interrogative, and yet really imply wonder, sur-
prise, or astonishment, it must be confessed to
be of no small importance in reading, and very
justly to deserve a place in grammatical punc-
tuation.
Thus the sentence, How mysterious are the ways
of Providence ! which naturally adopts the ex-
clamation, may, by a speaker who denies these
mysteries, become a question, by laying a stress
on the word how, and subjoining the note of inter-
rogation; as, How mysterious are the ways of Pro-
vidence? Upon hearing a piece of music, we may
cry out with rapture, What harmony is that! Or
we may use the same words to inquire, Whal har-
mony is that? that is, what kind of harmony.
RULE I.
The inflections required by the note of exclama-
tion are exactly the same as those required by the
other points; that is, if the exclamation point be
placed after a member that would have had the
rising inflection in another sentence, it ought to
have the rising in this; if after a member that would
have had the falling inflection, the exclamation
ought to have the falling inflection likewise.
Example.
How great must be the majesty of that place, where
the whole art of creation has been employed, and where
God has chosen to show himself in the most magnificent
manner!
RULE II.
If exclamation be mingled with a question,
the member requires the same inflection that an
interrogative member would require.

Example.
Whither shall I turn? Wretch that I am ! to what
place shall I betake myself ? Shall I go to the capitol?
alas! it is overflowed with my brother's blood! or shall
I retire to my house ? Yet there I behold my mother
plunged in misery, weeping and despairing !
Whither shall I turn? terminates like a question
with the interrogative word. The member, wretch
that I am, with the rising inflection, as forming
incomplete sense. Shall I go to the capitol? with
the rising intlection, as a question without the
interrogative word; alas! it is overflowed with my
brother's blood, with the falling inflection, as a de-
claratory sentence. The member commencing
with the disjunctive or, with the falling inflection :
and the last member with the same inflection, as
a declaratory sentence.
RULE Ill.
This rule forms an exception to Rule 1, which
exception is as follows : When the exclamation
comes immediately after a question, and, as it
were, repeats it, the repeated question, which is
really an exclamation, assumes the rising in-
flection.
Example.
Will
you for ever, Athenians, do nothing but walk up
and down the city, asking one another, What news ?
What news! Is there any thing more new than to see a
man of Macedonia become master of the Athenians, and
give laws to all Greece.—Demosthenes.
Here the first question includes the last, and,
being formed without the interrogative words, re-
quires the rising inflection: and as the sentence
of admiration, What news! iinmediately follows,
it exactly imitates the object it ironically admires.
This inflection of the note of admiration is not
confined to the repetition of this inflection in the

foregoing question ; for if a question be asked
with the falling inflection, and we immediately
echo the question, and turn it into an admiration,
the voice adopts the rising inflection.
Example.
Plant of celestial seed, if dropp'd below,
Say in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow?
Fair opening to some court's propitious shrine,
Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine?
Twin'd with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield,
Or reap'd in iron harvests of the field ?
Where grows? where grows it not ? if vain our toil,
We ought to blame the culture, not the soil.
Pope's Essay on Man.
Here the phrase, where grows, assumes the
rising inflection, and ought to be marked with the
note of exclamation.
Purenthesis.
The parenthesis is defined by Dr. Lowth, to
be a member of a sentence inserted in the body
of a sentence, which member is neither pecessary
to the sense, nor at all affects the construction.
In pronouncing it, the tone of voice ought to be
interrupted, as it were, by something unforeseen;
and, after a pause, the parenthesis should be
pronounced in a lower and swifter tone of voice ;
and at the end of it, after another pause, the
higher tone of voice, wbich had been interrupted,
should be resumed, that the connexion between
the former and latter part of the interrupted sen-
tence may be restored.
RULE I.
The most general rule is, that the parenthesis
always terminates with that pause and inflection
of voice with which the interrupted part of the


## p. 91 (#105) #############################################

PARENTHESIS.
91
sentence that precedes it is marked. Accord-
ingly, when the member immediately preceding,
ends with imperfect sense, or a' comma and the
rising inflection, (which is almost always the case,)
the parenthesis ends with a comma, and the rising
inflection likewise.
Example.
Know ye not, bréthren, (for I speak to them that know
the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man as long
as he liveth ?-Rom. vii. 1.
When it ends with perfect sense, generally
marked with a colon, and consequently requires
the falling inflection of voice, (which very seldom
happens, the parenthesis ends with a colon and
the falling inflection also.
Example.
Then went the captain with the officers, and brought
them without violence; (for they feared the people, lest
they should have been stoned :) And when they had
brought them, they set them before the council.
Acts, v. 26, 27.
Before we proceed to give other examples, it
must be observed, that as the parenthesis is to be
pronounced in a lower tone than the principal
sentence, the pause and inflection of voice with
which the parenthesis ends, must necessarily be
pronounced lower than the same pauses and in-
tiections terminating the preceding member. To
resume, therefore, the rule: a parenthesis must
be pronounced in a lower and swifter tone of
voice, and conclude with the same pause and
inflection which terminate the member that im-
mediately precedes it.

us, that Marcus proved a mere blockhead; and that nature

Dr. Clarke has observed, that Homer is more perspi-

may be questioned,) the perspicuity arises from his sub-

Ward's Grammar.

It is this sense which furnishes the imagination with
its ideas ; so that by the pleasures of the imagination or
fáncy, (which I shall use promíscuously,) I here meau

When parentheses are long, we must take care
to read them in so different a tone of voice from ·
the rest of the sentence, as may keep them per-
fectly distinct. This is to be done not only by
lowering the voice and pronouncing the parenthesis
more rapidly, but by giving a degree of monotone
or sameness to the voice, which will distinguish
the parenthesis better than any of the other pe-
culiarities.
Examples.
Since then every sort of good which is immediately of
importance to happiness, must be perceived by some im-

réasoning, (for it is the business of reason to compare the
several sorts of good perceived by the several senses,
and to find out the proper means for obtaining them,) we

must, therefore, carefully inquire into the several sublimer
perceptive powers or senses; since it is by them we best
discern what state or course of life best answers the in-
tentions of God and nature, and wherein true happiness
consists.—Hutcheson's Moral Philosophy.
If sometimes, on account of virtue, we should be ex-
posed to such evils, which is sometimes the case, (though
men are much more frequently involved by their vices in
such evils, and that in a more shamefully base wáy,)
virtue can teach us to bear such evils with resolution, or
to conquer them.-Ibid.
And although the diligent and active should not, with-
out weighty causes, be any way restrained in their just
acquisitions ; (and, indeed, the best sorts of democracy
may allow them to acquire as much as can be requisite
for any elegance or pleasure of life that a wise man could
desire :) yet we are never to put in the balance with the
liberty or safety of a people, the gratifying the vain am-
bition, luxury, or avarice of a few.-Ibid.
For these reasons the senate and people of 'Athens
(with due veneration to the gods and heroes, and
guar-
dians of the Athenian city and territory, whose aid they
now implore ; and with due attention to the virtue of
their ancestors, to whom the general liberty of Greece
was ever dearer than the particular interest of their own
státe) have resolved that a fleet of two hundred vessels
should be sent to sea, the admiral to cruize within the ,
streights of Thermopyla.--Demosthenes.
As to my own abilities in speaking, (for I shall admit

than what precedes and follows: and we must
never forget, that when the parenthesis has been
pronounced, the voice must recover the higher
tone it fell from, in order to preserve the connexion
in the thoughts. Without these precautions, it will
often be impossible to pronounce Milton so as to
render bim intelligible. Take a few examples for
practice.

Exception to this Rule.
When the parenthesis terminates with an em-
phatical word which requires the falling inflection,
emphasis requires, that the parenthesis should
terminate with the falling instead of the rising in-
flection.
Cicero, speaking of the duties of magistrates,
says,
Care must be taken that it bé not (as was often done
by our ancestors through the smallness of the treasury
and continuance of the war) necessary to raise taxes ;
and in order to prevent this, provision should be made
against it long before-hand: but if the necessity of this
service should happen to ány state (which I had rather
suppose of another than our own; nor am I now dis-
coursing of our ówn, but of every state in general) me-

: ACCENT.
ral rule, end with the rising inflection, but the
middle parenthetic member ending with two em-
phatic objects, the last of which requires the fall-
ing inflection, the general rule must be dispensed
with.
Accent.
As accent relates to the pronunciation of words
taken singly, it can have little to do with the pro-
nunciation of words in succession, as Elocution,
perhaps, may not improperly be called. A person
who pronounces every word singly with the greatest
purity, may not be able to read well; and ano-
ther may convey the sense of an author with great
force and beauty, who does not always either
pronounce the words justly, or place the accent
on the proper syllable. The only point, therefore,
in which it will be necessary to take notice of ac-
cent in reading, is that where the emphasis re-
quires a transposition of it. This happens when
two words which have a sameness in part of their
formation, are opposed to each other in sense.
Thus, if we pronounce the words justice, and in-
justice, as single words, we naturally place the
accent on the penultimate syllable of each ; but
if we contrast them, and say, “Neither justice
nor injustice has any thing to do with the present
question;" we naturally place the accent on the
first syllable of injustice, in order the more forci-
bly and clearly to distinguish it from justice.
This transposition of the accent extends itself
to all words which have a sámeness of termina-
tion, though they may not be directly opposite in
sense : thus, if we wanted more particularly to
show that we meant one requisite of dramatic
story rather than another, we should say, In
this species of composition, plausibility is much
more essential than probability; altering the

ACCENT.
97
usual pronunciation of the words plausibility and
probability, by trapsposing the accent of each
from the third to the first syllable, in order
to contrast those parts of the words, which are
distinguished from each other by the import of the
sentence. Of the necessity of attending to this
emphatical accent we shall give the following
Examples.
In this case I may use the saying of an eminent wit,
who upon some great men's pressing him to forgive his
daughter, who had married against his consent, told them
he could refuse nothing to their instances, but that he
would have them remember there was a difference be-
tween giving and forgiving.
In this example, we find the whole sense of the
passage depends on the placing the accent on the
first syllable of forgiving, in order to contrast it
more strongly with giving, to which it is opposed.
The prince for the public good has a sovereign power
in every private person's estate; and, consequently, his
riches must increase or decrease, in proportion to the
number and riches of his subjects.---Spectator.
The words increase and decrease have, in this
example, the accent on the first syllable of each,
as it is there the contrast in the sense lies.
To the foregoing observations upon accent, it
may not be irrelevant to add what Dr. Blair says
upon the subject.
“In the English language," says he, "every word
which consists of more syllables than one has
one accented syllable. The accent rests some-
times on the vowel, sometimes on the consonant.
Seldom or never is there more than one accented
syllable in any English word, however long; and
the genius of the language requires the voice to
mark that syllable by a stronger percussion, and
to pass more slightly over the rest. Now, having

once learned the proper seats of these accents, it
is an important role to give every word just the
same accent in public speaking, as in common
discourse. Many persons err in this respect.
When they speak in public, and with solemnity,
they pronounce the syllables in a different manner
from what they do at other times. They dwell upon
them and protract them : they multiply accents
on the same word; from a mistaken notion, that
it gives gravity and force to their discourse, and
adds to the pomp of public declamation. Where-
as, this is one of the greatest faults that can be
committed in pronunciation; it makes what is
called a theatrical, or mouthing manner; and
gives an artificial, affected air to speech, which
detracts greatly from both its agreeableness, and
its impression."
Emphasis.
Emphasis, in Elocution, is a term generally,
but absurdly, used by modern writers exclusively in
the singular number. "Empbasis," says Mr. Sheri-
dan, " discharges in sentences the same kind of of-
fice that accent does in words. As accent is the
link which ties syllables together, and forms them
into words; so emphasis unites words together,
and forms them into sentences:
“ The necessity of observing propriety of em-
phasis is so great, that the true meaning of words
cannot be conveyed without it. For the same in-
dividual words, ranged in the same order, may
have several different meanings, according to the
placing of the emphasis. Thus, to use a trite
instance, the following sentence may have as
many different meanings as there are words in it,
by varying the emphasis : 'Sball you ride to
town to-morrow?' If the emphasis be on shall, as,
SHALL you ride to town to-morrow? it will imply
that the person spoken to bad expressed before

99
such an intention, but that there is some doubt
in the question whether he be determined on it or
not; and the answer may be, Certainly, or, I am
not sure.
If it be on you, as, Shall you ride to
town to-morrow? the question will imply that some
one is to go, and do you mean to go yourself, or to
send some one in your stead ? and the answer may
be, No, but my servant shall. If on ride, as, Shail
you RIDE, &c. ? the answer may be, No, I shall
walk, or go in a coach. If on town, as, Shall you
ride to town to-morrow? the answer may be, No,
but I shall ride to the forest. If on to-morrow,
as, Shall you ride to town TO-MORROW? the answer
may be, No, not to-morrow, but the next day."
According to Mr. Walker, "emphasis, in the
most usual sense of the word, is that stress with
which certain words are pronounced, so as to
be distinguished from the rest of the sentence."
But such a definition is much too vague to meet
even the full signification of the term in popular
usage: for no one, in reality, applies the term
emphasis to the mere grammatical or inherent
force that distinguishes, in all distinct and intel-
ligible spontaneous speech, the nouns and verbs
above the articles, conjunctions, and preposi-
tions. The term, on the contrary, always sup-
poses some superadded distinction given to a
word or words of what description soever, and
conferring upon such words a degree of impor-
tance in the sentence, beyond what is inherent in
their mere grammatical quality.
Mr. Cockin in his “ Art of delivering written
Language," distinguishes enphases into emphasis
of sense and emphasis of force. This distinction
is highly commended by Mr. Walker, who quotes
Mr. Cockin's definition as follows: “Emphasis
of force,” he tell us, “is that stress we lay on
almost every significant word : empbasis of sense
is that stress we lay on one or two particular
words, wbich distinguishes them from all the rest


## p. 100 (#114) ############################################

EMPHASIS.
of the sentence. The former stress,” he observes,
“is variable, according to the conception and
taste of the reader, and cannot be reduced to any
certain rule : the latter is determined by the sense
of the author, and is always fixed and invariable."
“ This distinction, it must be owned," continues
Mr. Walker, “ is, in general, a very just one,
and a want of attending to it has occasioned great
confusion in this subject, even in our best writers.
Thus, when the emphatical words were to be
marked, by being printed in a different character,
we find in several of the modern productions on
the art of reading, that sometimes more than half
the words are printed in italics, and considered
equally emphatical. The wrong tendency of such
a practice," continues Mr. Walker, “ was never
pointed out till the essay above mentioned." To
this distinction of emphasis, Mr. Walker adds
another, making “a distinction of each into two
kinds, according to the inflection of voice they
adopt; which, though of the utmost importance
in conveying a just idea of emphasis, had never
been
noticed by any of our writers on the subject:""
“ The distinction thus added is that which re-
lates to the application of the rising and the falling
inflection, and which is assuredly a distinction of
much importance in what relates to the practical
adjustment of the emphasis. This," says he,“ brings
us to a threefold distinction of words, with regard
to the force with which they are pronounced ;
namely, the conjunctions, particles, and words
understood; which are obscurely and feebly pro-
nounced; the substantives, verbs, and more sig-
nificant words, which are firmly and distinctly
pronounced ; and the emphatical word, which is
forcibly pronounced : it is only the last of these
which can be properly styled emphasis." And
here we may observe, that if these distinctions are
just, the common distinction of emphasis is very
faulty. Enphasis is said to be a stress laid on

EMPHASIS.
101
one or more words to distinguish them from
others; but this definition makes almost every
word in a sentence emphatical, since, as we have
just seen, the substantives, verbs, and significant
words, should be distinguished from the others.
Mr. Walker adds," the principal circumstance
that distinguishes emphatical words from others,
seems to be a meaning which points out, or dis-
tinguishes, something as distinct or opposite to
some other thing. When this opposition is ex-
pressed in words, it forms an antithesis, the oppo-
site parts of which are always emphatical. Thus,
in the following couplet from Pope :
"Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill.
The words writing and judging are opposed to
each other, and are, therefore, the emphatical
words."
But this describes only the emphasis of anti-
thesis, which is certainly not the only species of
emphasis, properly so called, that is requisite to
well-delivered speech; for words are rendered
important by apposition as well as by opposition;
by their relative and their absolute consideration
in the sentence; and by their reflective, as well as
their antagonist meaning. The threefold distinc-
tion above quoted, does, however, furnish a clew
to this mazy labyrinth; and Mr. Walker's con-
cluding definition, though imperfect, as exclu-
ding some essential classes of emphasis, is strict-
ly applicable to the full extent of his view.
“Emphasis,” says be,“ when applied to parti-
cular words, is that stress we lay on words which
are in contradistinction to other words, either ex-
pressed or understood. And hence will follow
this general rule; Wherever there is contradistinc-
tion in the sense of the words, there ought to be empha-
sis in the pronunciation of them; the converse of
this being equally true, wherever we place empha-
sis, we suggest the idea of contradistinction."

EMPHASIS.
Now, though it is not true, that all emphases have
an antithesis, either expressed or understood, yet
as the emphasis of antithesis constitutes a very
large and material class of these rhetorical distinc-
tions, the following rules may be regarded as bighly
important.
** If the emphasis excludes the antithesis, the
emphatic word has the falling inflection; if the
emphasis does not exclude the antithesis, the em-
phatic word has the rising inflection. The grand
distinction, therefore, between the two emphatic
inflections is this ; the falling inflection affirms
something in the emphasis, and denies what is
opposed to it in the antithesis ; while the em-
phasis, with the rising inflection, affirms something
in the emphasis, without denying what is opposed
to it in the antithesis; the former, therefore, from
its affirming and denying absolutely, may be called
the strong emphasis; and the latter, from its af-
firming only, and not denying, may be called the
weak emphasis.” La
They who pursue Mr. Walker through all his
distinctions of simple, double, and triple em-
phasis, will undoubtedly, upon the whole, be
much edified, but, while he has, in some instances,
well defined the principle of the application of
the rising and the falling inflections to emphatic
words, he has left it to more recent discovery to
define and classify the several species of empha-
sis, properly so called.
All emphases affect the words upon which they
fall in the three predicaments of time, of tune,
and of force; but as some species of emphasis re-
quire a preponderancy of one, and other species
of another of those properties, emphasis may
operly be contradistinguished into three kinds;
emphasis of time, or the condition of words ren-
dered emphatical, by the increased quantity as-
signed to the respective syllables; emphasis of
tune, or the condition of words rendered empha-

103
tical, by the distinction of a superior degree of
inflection, or by a higher or lower pitch in the
musical scale; and emphasis of force, or the con-
dition of words, rendered emphatical by the su-
perior energy with which they are uttered.
The kinds of emphasis that may be enumerated,
are as follows:
1st, The objective emphasis, or emphasis of
import, i. e. the stress of voice by which pro-
portionate importance is given to the word or
words, conveying the substantive-matter, or lead-
ing object of the sentence, as, “I am desirous
of being acquainted with the nature of man.”
That is to say, “the nature of man is a subject
to which I am desirous of directing some inquiry;"
an idea which may be expressed either with, or
without any reference to any other subject. In
the latter case, no antithesis is either expressed
or implied, and the simple emphasis of import is
expressed by an increased stress of the voice,
thrown upon the whole of the syllables, com-
posing the amalgamated substantive or compound
name of that object, namely, “the nature of man."
Endly, Emphasis of antithesis, or that charac-
teristic stress and inflection of the voice by which
the opposition between two ideas, or parts of a
compound idea, is pointed out, and emphatically
impressed upon the mind. The antithesis may
be either expressed or understood : for instance,
if the preceding passage be re-quoted with an
emphasis upon the word nature only, and that
emphasis be principally specified by a strong
circumflective accent, thus, I am desirous of be-
coming acquainted with the nature of man; the
words will have changed, to a certain degree, their
signification; an antithesis will then be under-
stood; and the intrepretation will be, “ It is
not the history, it is not the outward form and
complexion, or any other particular incident re-
lative to man, but his general nature, his phy-


## p. 104 (#118) ############################################

104
EMPHASIS.
sical and moral attributes, that I am desirous of
knowing." Again, if the single word man be
rendered emphatic, by superadding to the cus-
tomary energy of the closing poise or final heavy
syllable, a certain portion of the same species of
time; thus, “I am desirous of becoming ac-
quainted with the nature of man;" the sentence
will then, by another implied antithesis, come to
signify, “It is not with the nature of stones, and
earths, and shrubs, and herbs, and brute animals,
that I am desirous of becoming acquainted, but
with that of man.” Of the direct or expressed
antithesis we have an illustration in the following
sentence: " It is not with the nature of Màn but
the nature of God, that I am desirous of being
acquainted."
3rdly, The emphasis of coincidence, or the level
and equal stress of the voice upon two or more
words either in the same or different members of
a sentence, by which the relationship, agreement,
and equal importance of the annexed ideas, are
indicated : as, the stature, the form, and the com-
plexion of man, as well as his moral and physical
attributes are parts of bis nature ; and his history
must be studied, that his nature may be un-
derstood.” In this instance, all the words dis-
tinguished by italics demand the emphasis of
coincidence; a species of emphasis, which is ex-
pressed more by its time or quantity, than by
either its ipflection or its force. And as this is
the species of emphasis that is least obtrusive,
it is that which may be used with the greatest
frequency and freedom.
4thly, Complicated emphasiş. Sometimes all
the different kinds of emphases are mingled in one
sentence; so that several different words, or pairs
of words, require to be discriminated in all the
varieties and degrees of time, tune, and force.
For example, " It is not the NATURE of man that
I am Desirous of studying; but the laws of God


## p. 105 (#119) ############################################

EMPHASIS.
105
that I am Anxious to comprehend." Here NA-
TURE, LAWS, pan, Bob, Desirous, Anxious, study-
ing,comprehend, require to be respectively balanced
and coupled in the mind by appropriate responses
of quantity, tune, and force.
There is one thing more which it is necessary to
observe on the subject of emphasis. It has been
mistakenly supposed, that the distinction of em-
phasis necessarily belongs to single words; nay
some there are, who, confounding emphasis with
mere percussion, would confine it to single sylla.
btes: but the fact is, that emphasis, properly so
called, belongs not to either the syllabic separa..
tion, or grammatical structure of words, but to
the idea; and whether the substantive be ex-
pressed by a simple or by a compound name, the
whole name of that idea, not a part only of the
name, must bear the equal impress of that empha-
sis :-thus, for example, in the famous reply of
the first William Pitt to Mr. Walpole," But
youth, sir, is not my only crime; I have been ac-
cused of acting a theatrical part." Here nei-
ther the word acting, nor the word theatrical, nor
the word part, taken separately, designates the jut
of the accusation, or constitutesthe name of the
idea included in the accusation : for if we read,
“ I have been accused of acting a theatrical part,"
placing the emphasis only on the word acting :
may it not properly be asked, Why, what would
you do with a theatrical part, but act it? If the
emphasis be placed on theatrical, thus, “ I have
been accused of acting a theatrical part:"-What
part should be acted, but one that is theatrical ?
If upon the word part alone, thus, “I have been
accused of acting a theatrical part."—What that
is theatrical can be acted but a part? The whole
latter member of the sentence constitutes, there-
fore, the jut or object of the accusation. “I have
been accused, (of what ?) of acting a theatrical

EMPHASIS
part!” These words, therefore, constitute the
amalgamated substantive, or compound name of
the indivisible accusatory idea, and must receive
throughout an equal portion of objective emphasis.
Not that the syllables are thereby to be rendered
equally forcible, or to be otherwise reduced to
one monotonous level. They are only to receive
one common superaddition of emphatic force ;
and as, independently of such superaddition, they
would have differed among themselves in pause,
quantity, accent, and grammatical or inherent
force, in all those particulars they will still con-
tinue to differ.
Mr. Walker's distinction of emphasis into sin-
gle, double, and treble, is as follows:
'Single emphasis," says he, “is either where two
emphatic words in antithesis with ea 'h other are
expressed; or where but one of them is expressed,
and the antithesis to it implied or understood.
But besides these, there are instances where two
emphatic words are opposed to two others, and
sometimes where three emphatic words are op-
posed to three others in the same sentence.

rail are in antithesis with each other, and do not
suggest any other antithetic objects; and this
may be called the single emphasis expressed.
In the next example, the emphatic words gross
and refined are opposed to each other, and con-
trasted with sense and understanding; and this
mutual correspondence and opposition of four
parts to each other, may not improperly be termed
the double emphasis.
When three antithetic objects are opposed to
three, as in No. 4, we may call the assemblage
the treble emphasis.
Negative Sentence.
The appropriation of the falling inflection to
the positive member of a sentence, and of the rising
inflection to the negative member, runs through
the whole system of pronunciation. Agreeably
to this arrangement, we constantly find good
readers finish negative sentences with the rising
inflection, where ordinary readers are sure to use
the falling inflection, and to drop the voice.
Example.
Observe, ther, Æschines; our ancestors acted thus in
both these instances; not that they acted for their be-
nefáctors not that they saw po dánger in these expe-
ditions. Such considerations never could induce them
to abandon those who fled to their protéction. No, from
the nobler motive of glory and rendwn, they devoted their
services to the distressed.Demosthenes.
Wherever, therefore, a negative sentence, or
member of a sentence, is in opposition to a posi-
tive sentence, or member of a sentence, we find it
usually adopt the rising inflection. And often
where there is no correspondent positive member
or sentence expressed, if the negative member or
sentence would admit of a positive, and that the

sense of this positive be agreeable to the general
tenor of the composition; we find the negative
member or sentence adopt the rising inflection.
Example.
As to those public works, so much the object of your
ridicule, they, undoubtedly, demand a due share of ho-
nour and applause; but I rate them far beneath the
great merit of my administration. It is not with stones
or bricks that I' have fortified the city. It is not from
works like these that I' derive my reputation. Would
you know my methods of fortifying ? Examine, and you
will find them in the arms, the towns, the territories, the
harbours, I have secured; the navies, the troops, the
armies I have raised.--Demosthenes.
General Emphasis.
By general emphasis, Mr. Walker means that
emphatic force which, when the composition is
very animated, and approaches to a close, we
often lay upon several words in succession. This
successive emphatic force does not suggest any
particular meaning excluded by it, nor is it so
much regulated by the sense of the author, as by
the taste and feelings of the reader; and therefore
it does not admit of any certain rule.
Example.
What men could do,
Is done already: Heav'n and earth will witness,
If Rome must fáll, that we are innocent.

Modulation of the Voice.
It ought, says Mr. Walker, to be a first prin-
ciple with all public readers and speakers, rather
to begin under the common level of their voice,
than above it. The attention of an auditory at
the commencement of a lecture or oration, makes
the softest accents of the speaker audible, at the
same time that it affords a happy occasion for
introducing a variety of voice, without which
every address must soon tire. A repetition of the
same subject a thousand times over, is not more
tiresome to the understanding, than a monotonous
delivery of the most varied subject to the ear.
Poets, to produce variety, alter the structure of
their verse, and rather hazard uncouthness and
discord, than sameness. Prose writers change the
style, turn, and structure of their periods, and
sometimes throw in exclamations, and sometimes,
interrogations, to rouse and keep alive the atten-
tion; but all this art is entirely thrown away, if
the reader do not enter into the spirit of his
L

MODULATION OF THE VOICE.
author, and by a similar kind of genius, render
even variety itself more various; if he do not, by
an alteration in his voice, manner, tone, gesture,
loudness, softness, quickness, slowness, adopt
every change of which the subject is susceptible.
Every one, therefore, who would acquire a
variety of tone in public reading or speaking,
must avoid, as the greatest evil, a loud and voci-
ferous beginning; and for that purpose it would
be prudent in a reader of speaker to adapt his
voice as if to be heard only by the person who is
nearest to him. If his voice has natural strength,
and if the subject has any thing impassioned in it,
a higher and louder tone will insensibly steal
on him; and his greatest address must be directed
to the keeping it within bounds. For this pur-
pose, it will be frequently necessary for him to
recal his voice, as it were, from the extremity of
his auditory, and to direct it to those who are
nearest to him. This it will be proper for him to
do almost at the beginning of every paragraph in
reading, and at the introduction of every part of
his subject in discourse.
A celebrated writer on this subject directs a
reader or speaker, upon his first addressing his
auditory, to fix his eyes, upon that part of them
from which he is the farthest, and to pitch his
voice so as to reach them. This, I fear, continues
Mr. Walker, would be attended with very ill con-
sequences if the assembly were very large; as a
speaker would be strongly tempted to raise his
voice, as well as increase its force, and by this
means begin in a key much too high for the gene-
rality of his auditory, or for his own powers to
continue it. The safest rule therefore is, cer-
tainly, to begin, as it were, with those of the
assembly that are nearest to us; and if the voice
be but articulate, however low the key may be, it
will still be audible.
Much, undoubtedly, will depend on the size

111
and structure of the place we speak in. Some
are so immensely large, as many of our churches
and cathedrals, that the voice is nearly as much
dissipated, as in the open air; and often with the
additional inconvenience of a thousand confused
echoes and re-echoes. Here a loud and vociferous
speaker will render himself unintelligible in pro-
portion to his exertion of voice: as departing and
commencing sounds will encounter each other,
and defeat every intention of distinctness and
harmony.
Nothing but good articulation will make a
speaker audible in this situation, and a judicious
attention to that tone of voice which is most
suitable to the size and imperfections of the
place. If the place we speak in be but small, the ,
loudness of the voice should be in proportion.
Gesture.
GESTURE, considered as a just and elegant
adaptation of every part of the body to the nature
and import of the subject we are pronouncing,
has always been considered as one of the most
essential parts of oratory. To be perfectly mo-
tionless while we are pronouncing words which
require force and energy, is not only depriving
them of their necessary support, but rendering
them unnatural and ridiculous. A very vehement
address pronounced without any motion but that
of the lips and tongue, would be a burlesque upon
the meaning.
Gesture consists principally in the actions of
the hands and face; and may be defined, a suitable
conformity of the motion of the countenance, and
of several parts of the body, in speaking of the
subject-matter of the discourse.
With regard to oratory, gesture may properly
be called the second part of pronunciation; in

112
GESTURE.
which, as the voice should be suited to the im-
pressions it receives from the mind, so the several
motions of the body ought to be accommodated
to the various tones and inflections of the voice.
When the voice is even and moderate, little ges-
ture is required; and nothing is more unnatural
and disgusting than violent motion, in discoursing
upon ordinary and familiar subjects. The motions
of the body should rise in proportion to the vehe-
mence and energy of the expression, as the natu-
ral and genuine effect of it.
Gesture is either natural, or from imitation ;
the former denotes such actions and motions,
either of the whole body, or of some particular
part of it, as naturally accompany our words, just
as these result from the impressions of our minds.
As to the whole body, it should not continue
long in the same position, but be constantly
changing with a gentle and moderate motion. As
to the several parts of the body, the head is the
most considerable: to lift it up too high, has the
air of arrogance and pride: to stretch it out too
far, or throw it back, appears clownish and un-
mannerly: to hang it downwards on the breast,
shows an unmanly bashfulness and want of spi-
rit: and to suffer it to lean on either shoulder,
argues sloth and indolence. In calm and sedate
discourses, the head should keep its natural state
and upright posture, occasionally moving, and
turning gently, sometimes on one side, and some-
times on the other, as occasion requires, and
then returning to its natural position. It should
always accompany the other actions of the body,
except in aversion, which is expressed by stretch-
ing out the right hand, and turning the head to
the left. But nothing is more indecent than
violent motions and agitations of the head.
The passions are principally represented by
the countenance; and the several parts of the
face contribute to the proper and decent gesture

>
of the whole. In a calm and sedate discourse, all
the features retain their natural situation. In
sorrow, the forehead and eye-brows lower, and
the cheeks hang down; but in expressions of joy
and cheerfulness, the forehead and eye-brows are
expanded, the cheeks contracted, and the corners
of the mouth drawn upwards. Anger and resent-
ment contract the forehead, draw the brows to-
gether, and thrust out the lips; and terror elevates
both the brows and forehead. To these natural
signs of the passions, the orator should endeavour
to conform.
The motions of the eyes require the most care-
ful management, because, as Cicero observes,
(De Orat. lib. 3, cap. 59,) other parts of the
countenance have but few motions; whereas all
the passions of the soul are expressed in the eyes
by so many different actions, that cannot possibly
be represented by any gestures of the body, if
the eyes be kept in a fixed posture : thus, in
speaking on pleasant and delightful subjects, the
eyes are brisk and cheerful ; but they sink and
are languid in delivering any thing melancholy
and sorrowful. In anger, the eyes discover a
certain vehemence and intenseness; in expres-
sions of hatred and detestation, the eyes are
turned either aside or downwards: thus Virgil

The eyes are also sometimes turned down-
wards, to express modesty, and they should be
always turned towards the object which is ad-
dressed. A gentle and moderate motion of the
eyes is commonly most suitable, whereby they
may be directed to some of the audience with an
air of respect and modesty; but their motions
ought to vary, according to the different nature

of the passions which they are designed to dis-
cover in the speaker, and convey to bis hearers.
The shoulders should be neither elevated nor
depressed; a continued motion of the arms should
be avoided; their action should be very moderate,
and follow that of the hands, which need never
be idle. Quinctilian lays great stress on the ac-
tion of the hands, when he says,
• The hands,
without which all gesture is lame and weak,
have a greater variety of motions than can well
be expressed: for they are almost equal to our
words. Do we not desire with them, promise,
call, dismiss, threaten, beseech, detest, fear,
forgive, deny? Do we not express joy, sorrow,
doubt, confession, penitence, measure, plenty,
number, and time? Do they not excite restraint,
prove, admire, and shame? That in so great a
variety of speech amongst nations and countries,
this seems to me the common language of man-
kind."-Inst. Orat. Lib. XI, cap. 3.
As all bodily motion is either upward or down-
ward, to the right or left, forward, or backward,
or circular, the hands are employed by the orator
in all these, except the last; and as they should
correspond with our expressions, they ought to
begin and end with them. In admiration, and
addresses to heaven, they must be elevated, but
never raised above the eyes; and in speaking of
things below us, they are directed downwards.
Side motion should generally begin from the left,
and terminate gently on the right. In demon-
strating, addressing, and on several other occa-
sions, the hands are moved forwards; and in
threatenings, sometimes thrown back : when the
orator speaks of himself, his right-hand should be
gently laid on his breast. When po other motion
is necessary, the hand should be kept about as
high as the breast, so as to make nearly a right
angle with the arm. They should never be suf-
fered to hang down, nor to loll upon the cushion

or bar. The left-hand should never move alone,
but accommodate itself to the motions of the
right: in motions to the left the right-hand should
not be carried beyond the left shoulder: in pro-
mises and expressions of compliment, the motion
of the hand should be gentle and slow ; but in
exhortations and applauses, more swift. The
hands should be generally open ; but in expres-
sions of compunction and anger, they may be
closed. Neither the breast nor the belly should
be thrust out; the trunk should be easy and
flexible, suiting itself to the motions of the head
and hands; and the feet should be kept steady.
There are other gestures which arise from imita-
tion; as when the orator describes some action,
or personates another speaking : but here he
should be careful not to overact his part, by run-
ning into any ludicrous or theatrical mimicry, or
changing his action or voice in a manner unsuit-
able to his own character.
Expression.
EXPRESSION, in oratory, denotes the manner
of delivering or conveying one man's ideas to
another. Accordingly, it denotes that felicity of
discriminative energy in the reader, speaker, or
reciter, by which the characteristic beauties or
peculiarities, whether of language, sentiment, or
passion, in a composition or oration, are forcibly
and happily illustrated, and the various shades
and transitions of style, signification, feeling, and
allusion, in such composition or oration, are dis-
tinctly and interestingly marked. Expression in
this, as in every other art, is one of the chief con-
stituents of excellence; and contradistinguishes
the elocutionist of taste and genius, from the
mere mechanical reader or declaimer. It depends

chiefly upon that quickness and vitality of per-
ception, which may be regarded, in some degree,
as an original gift of nature, and on that prompt
and perfect sympathy between the perceptive fa-
culty and the executive organs, which it is the
highest glory of art and practical exercise to pro-
duce.

ELOCUTION OF THE BAR.
The style of elocution adapted to this profession, will
best be understood by considering the objects to which
the eloquence of the bar is principally to be directed.
These are, 1st, To demonstrate, by the elucidation of
evidence, disputed facts; 2ndly, To convince, by argu-
ments, the doubtful judgment; 3rdly, Toinfluence by per-
suasion, or control by declamation, the passions, the
sympathies, and the moral feelings of those upon whom
the decision of a cause may depend. For the first of
those, we require an elocution, distinguished by impres-
sive distinctness, unaffected deliberation, and collected
coolness; an enunciation precise, without formality, at
once terse and familiar; a deportment, candid, firm, and
unassuming. For the second, we demanded an emphatic
perspicuity; an air of decisive, but modest confidence;
an ardour, not impetuous, but chastened and restrained
by all the decorums of circumstance and situation. For
the last, the noblest and most arduous of all the exertions
of forensic eloquence, are required a range of elocation-
ary expression, as various as the passions and emotions
to be commanded; an insinuating mildness; a melting or
kindling pathos; the tone, the look, the whole manner,
gesticulation, and deportment, should occasionally as-
sume the entire range of expressive variety, from the
most conciliating sympathy, to the deepest solemnity,
and even, perhaps, on some occasions, to intimidating
boldness. The occasions, indeed, on which all that is
here demanded can be exerted with propriety by the
forensic orator, may but rarely occur; but when they do
occur, the opportunities are decisive, and the reputation
of the pleader who is fully qualified to avail himself of
them, is stamped for ever.

ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.
ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.
The objects of clerical eloquence may be oratorically
thus enumerated, “ to inform the understanding even of the
inapprehensive; to arouse the slumbering conscience; to
regulate the moral feelings; to restore the socialsympathies,
which the disparities of fortune have but too much tendency
to suspend; to restrain the fury of ambition, and check
the mad career of voluptuous prodigality; to unlock the
iron grasp of avarice, and expand the liberal palm to deeds
of charity; to humble the towering insolence of pride,
and disarm the uplifted hand of oppression and revenge;
to infuse the spirit of benevolence into the heart of un-
feeling obduracy; to breathe the sacred love of peace into
the bosoms of the turbulent, and the mild spirit of forbear-
ance and toleration into the soul of persecuting bigotry
and prejudice.” How far all these objects are, prácti-
cally, in the contemplation of every orator of the pulpit,
this is no place to discuss; but if such be, in reality,
among the proper objects of pulpit eloquence, it is obvious
that all, and more than all, that we have demanded for
the Elocution of the Bar, is requisite in this species of
elocution also.
Among the indispensable requisites of such elocution,
are a familiar simplicity, insinuative and endearing; an
impressive energy, stimulative and arousing; a pathos,
varied, characteristic, and descriptive; and a sublimity
awful, elevating, and commanding. A mingled solemnity
and enthusiasm should occasionally give an air of inspi-
ration to the preacher; and his pronunciation, and all the
particulars of utterance properly included in the term
enunciation, should be full, sonorous, and oratorical,
rather than loose and colloquial. At the same time,
nothing is more to be avoided than
any
overmarked pecu-
liarity or affectation, or than the vulgar vehemence, the
bawling and vociferation, which are sometimes mistaken
for energy and oratorical animation.”
The faults generally observable in the elocution of the
pulpit are thus enumerated by Dr. Campbell in his
" Lectures on Pulpit Eloquence.” “The first I shall ob-

119
serve,” says he, “though not in itself a very great, yet is a
a very common fault, and often
proves
the source of se-
veral others, it is the straining of the voice beyond its na-
tural key, commonly the effect of a laudable desire to
make one's self be heard in a large congregation. This
however is one of those expedients that rarely fail to de-
feat the purpose which occasioned them. What is thus
spoken in a forced tone (though the note in the musical
scale emitted by the voice be higher) is neither so distinct,
nor so audible, as when it is spoken in the natural tone
of voice.
A second fault which is very common with preachers,
is too great rapidity of utterance. This is a great hinde-
rance to the attainment of an affecting or energetic pro-
nunciation ; besides that it greatly fatigues the attention
of the hearer, whom, after all, many things must escape,
which otherwise he might have retained.
A third fault I shall observe is a theatrical and too
violent manner. This, though it seems to proceed from
a commendable ardour, sins against propriety in many
ways. It suits not the gravity of the subject; and to
appear destitute of all command of one's self doth not
befit one who would teach others to obtain a perfect
mastery over their passions. The preacher’s manner in
general ought to be modest, at the same time earnest and
affecting
A fourth fault, which is indeed the opposite extreme
to that now mentioned, is an insipid monotony, by which
every thing that is said, whether narration, explanation,
argumentation, or address to the passions, is uniformly and
successively articulated in the same istless, lifeless man-
ner. And this is a much greater fault than the preceding.
The former offends only hearers of taste and reflection,
but the latter, all who can either understand or feel. The
preacher, in such a case, exhibits the appearance of a
school-boy who repeats a lesson he has conned over,
but who does not form a single idea of what he is saying
from beginning to end.
The fifth, and only other remarkable fault in pronun-
ciation I shall mention, is a sing-song manner; or what
we commonly call a cant, which is something like a
measure of a tune, that the preacher unintermittedly runs
over and over, till he conclude his discourse. This, as.
a kind of relief to the lungs, is what a strained voice,

when it becomes habitual, generally terminates in ; and
though it has not the same air of indifference with the mo-
notony, is in other respects liable to the same objections.
It marks no difference in the nature of the things said, and
consequently (though the tune itself were not unpleasant)
it may prove a lullaby, and dispose the hearers to sleep,
but is quite unfit for awakening their attention.”
ELOCUTION OF THE SENATE.
As the eloquence of the Senate is partly deliberative,
partly controversial, and partly declamatory, it requires
an elocution uniting almost all the principal requisites
enumerated under the two preceding heads; and it admits,
and even occasionally demands, a more impetuous
warmth, a more rapid and vehement emotion, than in
either of the former instances could be at all decorous.
The sermons of Massillon might require, or, at least,
their effect might be heightened by a denunciative severity,
an awful austerity of manner, that should impress his
audience with all the ideas and feelings of a supernatural
agency, and under such circumstances the oratory of the
pulpit might seem to have been carried, even above the
heights, and beyond the force of senatorial and popular
oratory; but it is in the senate alone, and the popular
assemblies of the nation, that the orator is to hurry away
the impetuous passions, and transport the hearer into
absolute action; and there only are, of course, required
the full thunders of elocutionary energy.
But it is not
only in the fervid tones of an impetuous declamation, that
the senatorial elocutionist should excel; in the calm
dignity of a well-modulated cadence, and the polished
grace and propriety of enunciation, he should also sur-
pass; and in the easy urbanity of tone and euphony
(when the stronger exertions of eloquence are not required)
he should manifest, at once the dignity of the statesman,
and the elegance and refinement of the polite scholar.
How little these circumstances (almost all of them within
the reach of a well-directed education) are attended to,
is but too generally known; and in the humble state of
modern oratory (as judged by its effects) the conse-
quences may but too well be discovered.

ELOCUTION OF THE STAGE.
The critical object of theatrical representation is Imi-
tation. Its excellence is versimilitude, and its elocu-
tion therefore should be that of Nature-Nature in her
highest perfection. The harmony may be more perfect,
the intonation something more diversified, the inflection
and range of the voice rather more extensive, the utte-
rance a little more emphatic, and some other graces and
observancés may be carried a degree further than ever
was observable (or perhaps practicable) in spontaneous
speech and real life; but still that spontaneity and reality
must be the models ; and the elocution, in all essential
particulars, that would be unfit for the bar, the pulpit, or
the popular assembly, (so far as the difference does not
arise out of the different sentiments to be expressed and
passions to be indulged and excited,) is unfit for the stage
also. It should be remembered, however, that the
drama deals in the extremes of passion and emotion ;
that its moral requires that it should exhibit those passions
bursting all honds of decorum, and triumphing over the
restraints of reason. The player has frequently to exhibit
the judgment under the domination of the passions; and is
even to represent the full malignity of the worst, as well
as the imprudent excesses of the best passions of our
nature; while the passions of the orator are always, in
reality (though not always in appearance) to be under the
control of his judgment; and all the malignant and evil
passions are to be suppressed, or kept out of sight, any
otherwise than as they may be mentioned, or alluded to,
in moral reprehension. Hence even the simplicity and
truth of principle may, and must produce, occasionally,
much apparent difference of effect; and the same exer-
cise of judgment (for the judgment of the player must,
in reality, still be paramount over his passion, though he
be exhibiting the very reverse) that leads the orator to
temper and qualify, may induce the actor to exaggerate
the passion. It is in these exaggerations, however, that
the art and mastery of the performer are most severely
tried, and taste and judgment are alike imperiously re-
quisite. They are necessary undoubtedly to the perfec-
tion of his art; yet the instant the exaggeration is appa-

rent, disgust begins ;--the instant the vulgar feeling of
wonder is excited, the tragedian sinks to a level with the
rope-dancer; and many a time ought he to be over-
whelmed with confusion by those very plaudits to the
attainment of which he has sacrificed all the finer touches
of nature that might have secured the genuine applause
of sympathy and emotion. But fully to attain, or even
distinctly to comprehend, the higher excellencies of
theatrical elocation, requires a very different course of
preparation and study from what generally falls to the
destiny, or enters into the apprehensions, of the professors
of this art. It is not in the science of the Green-room, the
library of the prompter, and the technical knowledge of
stage-trick, to make a finished actor. To deliver language
well, it is necessary fully to comprehend it, not loosely
and colloquially merely, but grammatically, etymologi-
cally, and sympathetically; to detect the nicest shades of
allusion and discrimination, and enter into the sentiment
of the author; to realize the passion, where passion is,
and the character, where the composition is character-
istic. To excel in any species of elocution, therefore,
demands some knowledge of general literature; to be
master of that elocution which should illustrate the fine
passages of Shakespeare, will require a knowledge of our
language which, fully possessed, would entitle the Elo-
cutionist to the rare and valuable character of an English
Scholar."

Gentlemen, the real prosecutor is the master of
the greatest empire the civilized world ever saw.
The defendant is a defenceless, proscribed exile.
He is a French royalist, who fled from his coun-
try in the Autumn of 1792, at the period of that
memorable and awful emigration, when all the
proprietors and magistrates of the greatest civilized
country of Europe were driven from their homes
by the daggers of assassins; when our shores
were covered, as with the wreck of a great tem-
pest, with old men, and women, and children, and
ministers of religion, who fled from the ferocity
of their countrymen, as before an army of inva-
ding barbarians !
This unfortunate gentleman had devoted a great
part of his life to literature. It was the amuse-
ment and ornament of bis better days. Since
his own ruin and the desolation of his country,
he has been compelled to employ it as a means
of support. For the last ten years he has been
engaged in a variety of publications of conside-
rable importance; but since the peace, he bas
desisted from serious political discussion, and
confined himself to the obscure journal now be-
fore you ; which will not be read in England, be-
cause it is not written in our language ; which
cannot be read in France, because its entry into
that country is prohibited by a power whose man-
dates are not very supinely enforced, nor often
evaded with impunity, which can have no other
object than that of amusing the companions of
the author's principles and misfortunes, by plea-
santries and sarcasms on their victorious enemies.

great states are compelled to consider the mili-

one of the main objects of their policy. Frequent
hostilities seem almost the necessary condition
of their greatness; and, without being great,
they cannot long remain safe. Smaller states,
exempted from this necessity, devoted themselves
to the arts of peace, to the cultivation of litera-
ture, and the improvement of reason. They became
places of refuge for free and fearless discussion;
they were the impartial spectators and judges of
the various contests of ambition, which, from time
to time, disturbed the quiet of the world. If wars
of aggrandizement were undertaken, their authors
were arraigned in the sight of Europe. If acts of
internal tyranny were perpetrated, they resounded

principle why have our newspapers been suffered

passed through a factious and stormy reign of
forty three years without a single imputation on

volution.
GENTLEMEN, the French Revolution-I must
pause after I have uttered words which present
such an overwhelming idea.-But I have not now
to engage in an enterprise so far beyond my force,
as that of examining and judging that tremen-
dous revolution.--I have only to consider the
character of the factions which it must have left
behind it.-The French revolution began with
great and fatal errors. These errors produced
atrocious crimes. A mild and feeble monarchy
was succeeded by bloody anarchy, which very
shortly gave birth to military despotism. France
in a few years, described the whole circle of hn-
man society. In a word, gentlemen, the great
body of the people of France have been severely
trained in those convulsions and proscriptions
which are the school of slavery. They are capa-
ble of no mutinous, and even of no bold and
manly political sentiments. And if this ode pro-
fessed to paint their opinions, it would be a most
unfaithful picture. But it is otherwise with thoso
who have been the actors and leaders in the scene
of blood.

the Sophists, the Rhetors, the Poet-laureats of
murder, who were cruel only from cowardice and
calculating selfishness, are perfectly willing to

does not disdain their infamous support. These
men, republicans from servility, who published
rhetorical panegyrics on massacre, and who re-
duced plunder to a system of ethics, are as ready
to preach slavery as anarchy. But the more
daring—I had almost said, the more respectable
ruffians, cannot so easily bend their heads under
the yoke. These fierce spirits have not lost “ the
unconquerable will, the study of revenge, immor-
tal hate." They leave the luxuries of servitude
to the mean and dastardly hypocrites, to the Be-
lials and Mammons of the infernal faction. The
recollection of their unbounded power renders
every inferior condition irksome and vapid; and
their former atrocities form a sort of moral destiny
which irresistibly impels them to the perpetration
of new crimes. They have no place left for peni-
tence on earth; they labour under the most awful
proscription of opinion that was ever pronounced
against human beings. They have cut down every
bridge by wbich they could retreat into the sp-
ciety of men. Awakened from their dreams of de-
mocracy—the noise subsided that deafened their
ears to the voice of humanity-the film fallen
from their eyes that hid from them the blackness
of their own deeds-haunted by the memory of
their inexpiable guilt, condemned daily to look on
the faces of those whom their hand made widows
and orphans, they are goaded and scourged by
these real furies, and hurried into the tumult of
new crimes, which will drown the cries of remorse;
or, if they be too depraved for remorse, will silence
the curses of mankind! They have no taste, no
occupation, no pursuit, but power and blood.
If their hands are tied, they must, at least, have
the indulgence of murderous projects. They have
drank too deeply of human blood, ever to re-
linguish their cannibal appetite !

5.-Panegyric on the Conduct of Queen Elizabeth,
at the time of the Spanish Armada.
The reign of Queen Elizabeth may be consider-
ed as the opening of the modern history of England,
especially in its connexion with the modern system
of Europe, which began about that time to assume
the form that it preserved till the French revolu-
tion. Philip II, at the head of the greatest empire
then in the world, was openly aiming at universal
domination. Elizabeth was among the first objects
of his hostility. That wise and magnanimous
princess placed herself in the front of the battle
for the liberties of Europe. Her only effectual
ally was the spirit of ber people; and her policy
flowed from that magnanimous nature, which, in
the hour of peril, teaches better lessons than those
of cold reason. Her great heart inspired her with
a higher and a nobler wisdom, which disdained to
appeal to the low and sordid passions of her
people, even for the protection of their low and
sordid interests; because she knew, or rather she
felt, that these are effeminate, creeping, cowardly,
short-sighted passions, which shrink from conflict
even in defence of their own mean objects. In

I may so speak, seems to have revealed to her the
importance of that great instrument for rousing

which she had no experience ; which, since her

which few modern statesmen have thoroughly
understood or wisely employed; which is, no
doubt, connected with many ridiculous and de-
grading details ; which has produced, and which
may again produce, terrible mischiefs; but of which
the influence müst, after all, be considered as the
most certain effect, and the most efficacious
cause of civilization; and which, whether it be
a blessing or a curse, is the most powerful engine
a politician can move-I mean The Press.

tary banditti; even then, when justice was trium-
phantly dragged at the chariot-wheels of a tyrant;
even then, when this unhappy country, triumphant
indeed abroad, but enslaved at home, had no
prospect but that of a long succession of tyrants
wading through slaughter to a throne; even then,
I say, when all seemed lost, the unconquerable
spirit of English liberty survived in the hearts of
English jurors.
That spirit, I trust, is not extinct: and if any
modern tyrant were, in the drunkenness of his
insolence, to hope to overawe an English jury, I
trust, and I believe, that they would tell him, "Our
ancestors braved the bayonets of Cromwell-we
bid defiance to yours." "_" Contempsi Cataline

What could be such a tyrant's means of over-
awing a jury? As long as their country exists,
they are girt round with impenetrable armour.
Till the destruction of their country, no dangers
can fall upon them, for the performance of their
duty: and I do trust, that there is no Englishman
so unworthy of life, as to desire to outlive Eng-
land. But if any of us are condemned to the
cruel punishment of surviving our country-if, in
the inscrutible counsels of Providence, this fa-
voured seat of justice and liberty-this noblest
work of human wisdom and virtue be destined to

sad exile, the consolation that we ourselves have
not violated the rights of hospitality to exiles-
that we have not torn from the altar the suppliant,

MR. (Now LORD) ERSKINE.
In Defence of Vint and others, for a Libel on Paul I.,
Emperor of Russia. (4)
7.-HISTORY NOT LIBEL.
(a) This is a prosecution which cannot pos-
sibly be supported, without saying that the con-
temporaneous history of the world is shut out
froni the British press, because if it is open to it
at all, it must be liberally, impartially, and fear-
lessly open to it, and ought not to be dependent
upon the interests or passions of the transient
rulers of the day. I am prepared fairly to examine
this, and not speculatively, but practically, as it
appears from the whole reason, intelligence, and
custom of our country; as it is embodied in all
our publications, not merely from private presses
without an instance of prosecution, but from the
public councils of the kingdom.
(5) If the princes of Europe were convinced, as
they declared themselves to be, that the very
principles, even without the arms, of the French
republic, threatened the existence of their estab-
lishments, was not this an earnest to Great Bri-

sufficient to overwhelm a power then in the first
throes and convulsions of a sanguinary revolu-
tion? Was not this state of things a signal for
universal activity and concord from the Mediter-
ranean to the Baltic ? Did it not promise a bond
of union more sacred and indissoluble than ever
before had united nations in the leagues of war ?
Was not their very existence as monarchs clearly
at stake, whilst England, from herinsular situation,
was more secure? And from the moment when
their warlike confederacy was declared and acted
upon, was there not then another and still

declared that republican France was incompatible
with the safety of Europe, they could not but
know that, (a) like the first law of nature in the
action and reaction of matter, the motto of re-
publican France would be the destruction of all

country and its government, for carrying on the
war, and could it possibly be considered as a
libel in our courts of justice, to prove that from
no fault of ours it had been unsuccessful, and
even disastrous ?--Would it, I say, be a libel in
a man fairly thinking and acting with government,
and writing from unanswerable facts in its de-
fence, to expose the causes which disappointed
so just an expectation, and ended in the rout and
discomfiture of this seemingly invulnerable pha-

(1) GENTLEMEN, this is not declamation, but
a correct introduction to facts which I mean to
state; and I will therefore first examine, to sup-
port it, the conduct of the late king of Prussia, who
was the first to accede to the confederacy and to
provoke the war. He penetrated into the heart
of France with a mighty army, and then, as if he
had been predestinated to establish that invasion
was impracticable, he turned quickly round as if
he had seen a spirit in his path, and dissolved his
army as by enchantment. At that critical time,
the French were, in a manner, a naked and de-
fenceless people, tearing from their sepulchres

the transmutation of animal substances for the
materials of war, which thus death itself was to
furnish for the destruction of the living : (7) whilst
the bells of their churches and the irons that sur-
rounded them, were the principal weapons she
could present against the invading sovereigns of
Europe, supported by their immense military es-
tablishments, and the energies of their ancient
governments undisturbed by civil commotion or
by external war. Yet this was the period when
these confederated princes, to whom all wisdom
is, it seems, alone with safety to be imputed, lay
upon their arms in slumberous unison, whilst civil
fury was preying upon the bowels of republican
France. Peace then be to the manes of the late
king of Prussia ! He was succeeded by the pre-
sent, who began his reign in an ominous vibration
between war and peace, between empty threats
and contemptible submission, suffering his nearest
and dearest kindred to remain exiles from the
countries and ancient inheritances of their fathers;
whilst he was engaged in some slippery, shabby
compromise for his own security; after having
suffered, without a remonstrance, the ancient
states of Switzerland to be overrun and subverted,
whilst he himself, a leader and chief of the Ger-
manic empire, with a bundred and fifty thousand
men in arms, was contented to suffer it to be dis-
solved for ever.
If this prince thought it better that France
should prevail, and acted upon this principle, why
was he not her ally ? Why did he tamper and
temporise? Why did he keep the word of pro-
mise to the ear, but break it to the hopes of
Europe ?-I apprehend, therefore, that it is out
of the power, at least of a British subject, to
libel the king of Prussia ; and to defame the em-
peror of Germany would scarcely be less difficult.
They had played their parts of pusillanimity and
folly together in rapid and disgraceful succession.

The present emperor I have heard described as
an amiable man, and it is, therefore, painful to
speak of him when truth must be spoken. What
was his conduct when he listened to the treaty of
Campo Formio ? Did he suppose that Buona-
parté, the most able and enterprising general
since the days of Alexander, would have offered
him peace on his near approach to Vienna, if he
had had full confidence in his own security? That
sagacious officer knew the contrary. He knew
that Italy was conquered, but not organized, and
might follow his steps in the revulsion of con-
quests, and other impending dangers suggested
the treaty. The bait to the emperor was Venice,
a bauble to please a child, to be taken away
again when it went to sleep! Yet for this, he
gave up the key of Italy. It may be said that
this was an act of necessity; but if it was, why
did he not yield to its imperious dictates, and if
the continuance of the war was impolitic, act
fairly upon the principles of peace ? But he did
neither : and when he saw danger approaching
the thrones of Tuscany, Naples, and Sardinia,
instead of calling out the legions of Bohemia
and Hungary, and making one great and last
peffort to baffle the gigantic projects of France;
he contented himself with sending a harlequin
into Italy to assist at a carnival.
As to the Emperor of Russia, whose character
is to be supported by this prosecution of a tran-
sient publication in a daily newspaper, he might
have laid for it a lasting foundation, if he had
consulted his own honour and security. He had
been bred in the school of adversity, and the world
looked up to him with high expectation, realised
by some acts of sound policy and wisdom on his
first coming to the throne; but he had afterwards

nor desire to have any thing to do with his guilt

may be considered by many as hostile to the im-

secured, and their interests promoted, I am
driven, in the defence of my client, to remark,
that it is mad and preposterous to bring to the
standard of justice and humanity, the exercise of
a dominion founded upon violence and terror.
It may, and must be true, that Mr. Hastings
has repeatedly offended against the rights and privi-
leges of Asiatic government, if he was the faith-
ful deputy of a power which could not maintain
itselt for an hour without trampling upon both :-
he may, and must have offended against the laws
of God and nature, if he was the faithful Viceroy
of an empire wrested in blood from the people to
whom God and nature had given it :-he may and
must have preserved that unjust dominion over
timorous and abject nations by a terrifying, over-
bearing, insulting superiority; if he was the faith-
fuladministrator of your government, which having
no root in consent or affection, no foundation in
similarity of interests, nor support from any one
principle which cements men together in society,
could be upheld only by alternate stratagem and
force. The unhappy people of India, feeble and
effemipate as they are from the softness of their
climate, and subdued and broken as they have
been by the knavery and strength of civilization,
still occasionally start up in all the vigour and
intelligence of insulted nature ;-to be governed
at all, they must be governed with a rod of iron;
and our empire in the East would, long since,
have been lost to Great Britain, if civil skill and
military prowess had not united their efforts to
support an authority, which heaven never gave,
by means which it never can sanction.

Gentlemen, I think I can observe that you are
touched with this way of considering the subject;
and I can account for it-I have not been con-
sidering it through the cold medium of books, but
have been speaking of man and his nature, and
of human dominion, from what I have seen of
them myself amongst reluctant nations submitting
to our authority (9) I know how they feel, and
how such feelings can alone be repressed. I have
heard them in my youth from a naked savage, in
the indignant character of a prince surrounded
by his subjects, addressing the governor of a
British colony, holding a bundle of sticks in his
hand, as the notes of his unlettered eloquence:
“Who is it?” said the jealous ruler over the
desert, encroached upon by the restless foot of
English adventure, “Who is it that causes this
river to rise in the high mountains, and to empty
itself into the ocean? Who is it that causes to
blow the loud winds of winter, and that calms
them again in the summer? Who is it that rears
up the shade of those lofty forests, and blasts
them with the quick lightning at his pleasure ?
The same Being, wbo gave to you a country on
the other side of the waters, and gave ours to
us, and by this title we will defend it,” said the
warrior, throwing down his tomahawk upon the
ground, and raising the war-sound of his nation.
These are the feelings of subjugated man all round
the globe; and depend upon it, nothing but fear
will control where it is vain to look for affection.
These reflections are the only antidotes to those
anathemas of super-human eloquence, which have
lately shaken the walls that surround us; but of
which it unaccountably falls to my province,
whether I will or not, a little to stem the torrent,
by reminding you, that you have a mighty sway
in Asia, which cannot be maintained by the finer
sympathies of life, or the practice of its charities
and affections. What will they do for you, when

theatre of pleasure; there, when the whole public
mind was at once awed and softened to the im-
pression of every human affection, there appeared
day after day, one after another, men of the most
powerful and exalted talents, eclipsing, by their
accusing eloquence, the most boasted harangues
of antiquity; rousing the pride of national resent-
nient by the boldest invectives against broken
faith and violated treaties, and shaking the bosom
with alternate pity and horror, by the most glow-

ever animated and energetic, from the love of
fame, which is the inherent passion of genius,
firm and indefatigable, from a strong preposses-
sion of the justice of their cause.
(a) Gentlemen, when the author sat down to
write the book now before you, all this terrible,
unceasing, exhaustless artillery of warm zeal,
matchless vigour of understanding, consuming and
devouring eloquence, united with the highest dig-

man, who was bound to hear it, in the face of the
whole people of England, with reverential sub-
mission and silence. I do not complain of this,
as I did of the publication of the charges, be-
cause it is what the law allowed and sanctioned
in the course of a public trial; but when it is
remembered, that we are not angels, but weak,
fallible men, and that even the noble judges of
that high tribunal are clothed beneath their ermines
with the common infirmities of man's nature, it
will bring us all to a proper temper for consider-
ing the book itself, which will, in a few moments,
be laid before you. But first, let me once more

name I will now give to you, sat down to com-

libel.
11.-Main Argument in Defence of Stockdale.
(a) GENTLEMEN, the question you have, there-
fore, to try upon all this matter, is extremely
simple ; it is neither more nor less than this ; at
a time when the charges against Mr. Hastings
were, by the implied consent of the Commons, in
every hand and on every table ; when, by their
managers, the lightning of eloquence was inces-
santly consuming him, and flashing in the eyes of
the public; when every man was with perfect
impunity, saying, and writing, and publishing just
what he pleased of the supposed plunderer and
deyastator of nations: would it have been crimi-
nal in Mr. Hastings himself to have reminded the
public that he was a native of this free land, en-
titled to the common protection of her justice,
and that he had a defence in bis turn to offer to
them, the outlines of which he implored them, in
the mean time, to receive as an antidote to the un-
limitedand unpunished poison in circulationagainst
him ? This is, without colour or exaggeration, the
true question you are to decide ; because I as-
sert, without the bazard of contradiction, that
if Mr. Hastings himself could have stood justified
or excused in your eyes for publishing this volume
in his own defence, the author, if he wrote it,
bona fide to defend him, must stand equally ex-
cused and justified; and if the author be justified,
the publisher cannot be criminal, unless you had
evidence, that it was published by him with a dif-
ferent spirit and intention from those in which it

was written. The question, therefore, is correct-
ly what I just now stated it to be: could Mr.
Hastings have been condemned to infamy for wri-
ting this book ?
(a) Gentlemen, I tremble with indignation, to
be driven to put such a question in England.
Shall it be endured, that a subject of this country
(instead of being arraigned and tried for some
single act in her ordinary courts, where the ac-
cusation, as soon at least as it is made public, is
followed within a few hours by the decision) may
be impeached by the Commons for the transac-
tions of twenty years, that the accusation shall
spread as wide as the region of letters,-that the
accused sball stand, day after day, and year after
year, as a spectacle before the public, which shall
be kept in a perpetual state of inflammation
against him; yet that he shall not, without the
severest penalties, be permitted to submit any
thing to the judgment of mankind in his defence ?
If this be law, (which it is for you to-day to de-
cide,) such a man has NO TRIAL; this great
hall, built by our fathers for English justice, is no
longer a court, but an altar ;-and an Englishman,
instead of being judged in it by GOD AND HIS
COUNTRY, is A VICTIM AND A SACRI-
FICE.

But I humbly expect that the benevolent Author
of our being will judge us as I have been pointing
out for your example.-Holding up the great
volume of our lives in his hands, and regarding
the general scope of them;-if he discovers benevo-
lence, charity, and good will to man, beating in
the heart, where he alone can look; if he finds
that our conduct, though often forced out of the
path by our infirmities, has been in general well
directed ; his all-searching eye will assuredly
never pursue us into those little corners of our
lives, much less will his justice select them for
punishment, without the general context of our
existence, by which faults may be sometimes
found to have grown out of virtues, and very many
of our heaviest offences to have been grafted by
human imperfection upon the best and kindest of
our affections.-No, gentlemen, believe me, this
is not the course of divine justice, or there is no
truth in the gospels of heaven.-If the general
tenour of a man's conduct be such as I have re-
presented it, he may walk through the shadow
of death, with all his faults about him, with as
much cheerfulness as in the common paths of life;
because he knows that, instead of a stern accuser
to expose before the Author of his nature those
frail passages which, like the scored matter in the
book before you, chequer the volume of the
brightest and best spent life, his mercy will ob-
scure them from the eye of his purity, and our re-
pentance blot them out for ever.

of lingering deliberation bad passed, a third re-

disturb him, he dies with a solemn declaration of
his innocence, and utters his last prayer for the
liberty of his country.
Let me now ask you, if any of you had ad-
dressed the public ear upon so foul and monstrous
a subject, in what language would you have con-
veyed the feelings of horrorand indignation? Would
you have stooped to the meanness of qualified
complaint? Would you have checked your feel-
ings to search for courtly and gaudy language ?
Would you have been mean enough-but I en-
treat your forgiveness—I have already told you
I do not think meanly of you; had I thought so
meanly of you I could not suffer my mind to com-
mune with you as it has done; had I thought you
that base and vile instrument attuned by hope
and fear in discord and falsehood, from whose
vulgar string no groan of suffering could vibrate,
no voice of integrity or honour could speak, let
me honestly tell you, I should have scorned to
fling my hand across it, I should have left it to a
fitter minstrel. If, therefore, I do not grossly err in
my opinion of you, I could invent no language
upon such a subject as this, that must not lag
behind the rapidity of your feelings, and that
would not disgrace those feelings, if it attempted
to decribe them.
Gentlemen, I am not unconscious that the
learned counsel for the crown seemed to address
you with a confidence of a very different kind;(a)
he seemed to expect from you a kind and respect-
ful sympathy with the feelings of the castle, and
the grief of chided authority; perhaps, gentlemen,
he knows you better than I do. If he does, he
has spoken to you as he ought; he has been right
in telling you that if the reprobation of this writer
is weak, it is because his genius could not make

his language has not been braided and festooned
as elegantly as it might; that he has not pinched
the miserable plaits of his phraseology, nor placed
his patches and feathers with that correctness of
millinery which became so exalted a person.
If you agree with him, gentlemen of the jury; if
you think that the man who ventures at the ha-
zard of his own life to rescue from the deep the
drowned honour of his country, must not presume
upon the guilty familiarity of plucking it up by
the locks, I have no more to say :-(a) do a cour-
teous thing, upright and honest jurors ! Sworn in-

verdict against the prisoner! And when you have
done so, march througb the ranks of your fellow,
citizens to your own homes, and bear their looks
as you pass along; retire to the bosom of your
families and your children, and when you are
presiding over the morality of the parental board,
tell those infants, that are to be the future men of
Ireland, the history of this day. Form their
young minds by your precepts, and confirm those
precepts by your own example. Teach them how
discreetly allegiance may be perjured on the
table, or loyalty be forsworn in the jury-box;
and when you have done so, tell them the story
of Orr-tell them of his captivity, of his children,
of his crimes, of his hopes, of his disappointments,
of his courage, and of his death; and when you
find your little hearers hanging from your lips;
when you see their eyes overflow with sympathy
and sorrow, and their young hearts bursting with
the pangs of anticipated orphanage, tell them, (6)

14.—Exordium to Speech in Defence of A. Hamilton
Rowan, Esq. (11)
GENTLEMEN of the Jury-when I consider the
period at which this prosecution is brought for-
ward; when I behold the extraordinary safeguard
of armed soldiers resorted to, no doubt for the
preservation of peace and order; when I catch,
as I cannot but do, the throb of public anxiety
which beats from one end to the other of this
hall; when I reflect on what may be the fate of
a man of the most beloved personal character, of
one of the most respectable families of our coun-
try-himself the only individual of that family,
I may almost say of that country, who can look
to that possible fate with unconcern ;-feeling as
I do all these impressions, it is in the honest sim-
plicity of my heart I speak, when I say, that I
never rose in a court of justice with so much
embarrassment, as upon this occasion.
If, gentlemen, I could entertain a hope of find-
ing refuge for the disconcertion of my mind
in the perfect composure of yours; if I could
suppose that those awful vicissitudes of human
events, which have been 'stated or alluded to,
could leave your judgment undisturbed, and your
hearts at ease, I know I should form a most er-
roneous opinion of your character: I entertain
no such chimerical hope ; I form no such unwor-
thy opinion; I expect not that your hearts can
be more at ease than my own; I have no right to
expect it; but I have a right to call upon yon,
in the name of your country-in the name of the
living God, of whose eternal justice you are now
administering that portion which dwells with us
on this side of the grave-to discharge your
breasts, as far as you are able, of every bias of
prejudice or passion; that if my client be guilty
of the offence charged upon him, you may give

fiance of the paltry artifices and senseless cla-
mours that have been resorted to, in order to
bring him to his trial with anticipated conviction.
And, gentlemen, I feel an additional necessity of
thus conjuring you to be upon your guard, from
the able and imposing statement, wbich you just
heard on the part of the prosecution. I know
well the virtues and talents of the excellent
person who conducts that prosecution. I know
how much he would disdain to impose on you by
the trappings of office; but I also know how
easily we mistake the lodgment which character
and eloquence can make upon our feelings, for
those impressions that reason and fact and proof
only ought to work upon our understandings. (12)
15.–Panegyric on the Constitution of Great Bri-
tain, from the same Speech. (13)
This paper, gentlemen, insists upon the ne-
cessity of emancipating the Catholics of Ireland,
and that is charged as part of the libel. Since
the commencement of the prosecution, this part
of the libel has unluckily received the sanction
of the legislature. In that interval our Catholic
brethren have obtained that admission, which it
seems it was a libel to propose : in what manner
to account for this, I am 'really at a loss. Have
any alarms been occasioned by the emancipation
of our Catholic brethren ? bas the bigoted malig-
nity of any individual been crushed ? or, has the
stability of the government, or that of the country,
been weakened ? or, is one million of subjects
stronger than four millions? Do you think that the
benefit they received should be poisoned by the sting
of vengeance? or do you wish to prepare them for

the revocation of these improvident concessions ?
Do you think it wise and humane, at this mo-
ment, to insult them, by sticking up in a pillory,
the man who dared to stand forth as their advo-
cate? (a) I put it to your oaths-do you think
that a blessing of that kind, that a victory ob-
tained by justice over bigotry and oppression,
should have a stigma cast upon it by an ignomi-
nious sentence upon men bold and honest enough
to propose that measure ? to propose the redeem-
ing of religion from the abuses of the church, the
redeeming of three millions of men from bondage,
and giving liberty to all who had a right to de-
mand it;-giving, I say, in the so much censured
words of this paper, giving “ UNIVERSAL
EMANCIPATION !" I speak in the spirit of the
British law, which makes liberty commensurate
with, and inseparable from, British soil, which
proclaims even to the stranger and sojourner, the
moment he sets his foot upon British earth, that the
ground on which he treads is holy, and consecrated
by the genius of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPA-
TION. No matter in what language his doom may
have been pronounced ;--no matter what complex-
ion incompatible with freedom, an Indian or an
African sun may have burnt upon him ;-no matter
in what disastrous battle his liberty may have been
cloven down;- no matter with what solemnities he
may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery ;
the first moment he touches the sacred soil of Bri-
tain, the altar and the god sink together in the dust;
his soul walks abroad in her own majesty, his
body swells beyond the measure of his chains, that
burst from around him; and he stands redeemed,
regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible
genius of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION!
(a) From this to the conclusion, forms a beautiful kind of climax ;
in which the voice should be allowed to increase gradually, and to
swell to its highest pitch on the last repetition of the words Universal
Emancipation, Rhetorically speaking, the figure contained in this
passage is Epistrophe.

(a) There is a sort of aspiring and adventurous
credulity, which disdains assenting to obvious
truths, and delights in catching at the improba-

To what other cause, gentlemen, can you ascribe
that in the wise, the reflecting, and the philoso-
phic nation of Great Britain, a printer has been
gravely found guilty of a libel, for publishing
those resolutions to which the present minister
of that kingdom had actually subscribed his name!
To what other cause can you ascribe, what in
my mind is still more astonishing, in such a coun-
try as Scotland--a nation cast in the happy me-
dium between the spiritless acquiescence of sub-
missive poverty, and the sturdy credulity of pam-
pered wealth ; cool and ardent; adventurous and
persevering ; winging her eagle fight against the
blaze ofevery science, with an eye that never winks,
and a wing that never tires; crowned as she is with
the spoils of every art, and decked with the wreath

searches of her Hume, to the sweet and simple,

Burns-how, from the bosom of a country like
that, genius and character, and talents, should be

tuation. The more merciful spirit of our law de-
prives you of that consolation ; his sufferings
must remain for ever before your eyes, a contin-
ual call upon your shame and your remorse. But
those sufferings will do more, they will not rest
satisfied with your unavailing contrition; they
will challenge the great and paramount inquest of
society: the man will be weighed against the
charge, the witness, and the sentence; and im-
partial justice will demand, why has an Irish
jury done this deed ? The moment he ceases to
be regarded as a criminal, he becomes of neces-
sity an accuser: and let me ask you, what can your
most zealous defenders be prepared to answer to
such a charge? When your sentence shall have
sent him forth to that stage which guilt alone
can render infamous, let me tell you, he will not
be like a little statue upon a mighty pedestal, di-
minishing by elevation; but he will stand a striking
and imposing object upon a monument, which if
it does not (and it cannot) record the atrocity
of his crime, must record the atrocity of his
conviction.
But I will not for the justice and honour
common country, suffer my mind to
be borne away by such melancholy anticipa-
tion. I will not relinquish the confidence that
this day will be the period of his sufferings; and,
however mercilessly he has been hitherto pur-
sued, that your verdict will send him home to the
arms of his family, and the wishes of his country.
But if-which heaven forbid !--it hath still been
unfortunately determined, that because he has
not bent to power and authority, because he
would not bow down before the golden calf, and
worship it, he is to be bound and cast into the
furnace, I do trust in God, that there is a redeem-
ing spirit in the constitution, which will be seen
to walk with the sufferer through the flames, and
to preserve him unhurt by the conflagration !

THE ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.
1.-On the Progress of the Soul to the Perfection
of its Nature.
Let me exhort you to make advances in the
path of righteousness, from the beauty and the
pleasantness of such a progress. Whatever dif-
ficulties may have attended your first entrance
upon the path of the just, they will vanish by
degrees; the steepness of the mountain will les-
sen as you ascend; the path in which you have
been accustomed to walk, will grow more and
inore beautiful; and the celestial mansions to
which you tend, will brighten with new splendour,
the nearer that you approach them.
In other affairs, continued exertion may occasion
lassitude and fatigue. Labour may be carried
to such an excess as to debilitate the body; the
pursuits of knowledge may be carried so far as to
impair the mind; but neither the organs of the
body, nor the faculties of the soul, can be en-
dangered by the practice of religion. On the
contrary, this practice strengthens the powers
of action. Adding virtue to virtue, is adding
strength to strength; and the greater acquisitions
we make, we are enabled to make still greater.
How pleasant will it be to mark the soul thus
moving forward in the brightness of its course! In
the spring, who does not love to mark the pro-
gress of nature; the flower unfolding into beauty,
the fruit coming forward to maturity, the fields
advancing to the pride of harvest, and the months
revolving into the perfect year? Who does not

love, in the human species, to observe the pro-
gress to maturity; the infant by degrees growing
up to man ; the young idea beginning to shoot,
and the embryo character beginning to unfold?
But if these things affect us with delight; if the
prospect of external nature in its progress; if the
flower unfolding into beauty; if the fruit coming
forward to maturity; if the infant by degrees grow-
ing up to man, and the embryo character beginning
to unfold, affect us with pleasurable sensations,
how much greater delight will it afford, to observe
the progress of this new creation, the growth of the
soul in the graces of the divine life, good resolu-
tions ripening into good actions, good actions
leading to confirmed habits of virtue, and the new
nature advancing from the first lineaments of
virtue, to the full beauty of holiness! These are
pleasures that time will not take away. While
the animal spirits fail, and the joys which depend
upon the liveliness of the passions, decline with
years, the solid comforts of a holy life, the delights
of virtue and a good conscience, will be a new
source of happiness in old age, and have a charm
for the end of life.
As the stream flows pleasantest when it ap-
proaches the ocean; as the flowers send up their
sweetest odours at the close of day; as the sun
appears with greatest beauty in his going down ;
so at the end of his career, the virtues and graces
of a good man's life come before him with the most
blessed remembrance, and impart a joy which
he never felt before. Over all the moments of life,
Religion scatters her favours, but reserves her
best, her choicest, her divinest blessings, for the
last hour.
Let me exhort you to this progressive state of
virtue, from the pleasant consideration, that it
has no period. There are limits and boundaries
set to all human affairs. There is an ultimate
point in the progress, beyond wbich they never

go, and from which they return in a contrary di-
rection. The flower blossoms but to fade, and
all terrestrial glory shines to disappear. Haman
life has its decline, as well as its maturity. From
a certain period, the external senses begin to de-
cay, and the faculties of the mind to be impaired,
till dust returns unto dust. Nations have their
day. States and kingdoms are mortal like their
founders. When they have arrived at the zenith
of their glory, from that moment they begin to
decline; the bright day is succeeded by a long
night of darkness, ignorance, and barbarity. But
in the progress of the mind to intellectual and
moral perfection, there is no period set. Beyond
these heavens, the perfection and happiness of
the just is carrying on-is carrying on, but shall
never come to a close. God shall behold his
creation for ever beautifying in his eyes ; for ever
drawing nearer to himself, yet still infinitely dis-
tant from the fountain of all goodness. There
is not in religion a more joyful and triumphant
consideration, than this perpetual progress which
the soul makes to the perfection of its nature,
without ever arriving at its ultimate period.
Here truth has the advantage of fable. No
fiction, however bold, presents to us a conception
so elevating and astonishing as this interminable
line of heavenly excellence. To look upon the
glorified spirit as going on from strength to
strength; adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge
to knowledge ; making approaches to goodness
which is infinite; for ever adorning the heavens.
with new beauties, and brightening in the splen-
dours of moral glory through all the ages of eter-
nity, has something in it so transcendant and
ineffable, as to satisfy the most unbounded am-
bition of an immortal spirit.

philosopher, whose views extend from one end of
nature to the other, was once a speechless infant
hanging at the breast; the glorified spirits, who
now stand nearest to the throne of God, were
once like you. To you, as to them, the heavens
are open; the way is marked out; the reward is
prepared.-On what you do, on what you now
do, all depends:-Logan.
2.- On Death.
Death is called in Scripture, the land without
any order; and without any order, the king of ter-
ror makes his approaches in the world. The com-
mission given from on high,was, "Gointo the world;
strike-strike so, that the dead may alarm the
living.” Hence it is, that we seldom see men
running the full careet of life ; growing old among
their children's children, and then fålling asleep
in the arms of nature, as in the embraces of a kind
mother; coming to the grave like a shock of corn
fully ripe, like flowers that shut up at the close of
day. Death walks through the world without any
order. He delights to surprise-to give a shock
to mankind. Hence, he leaves the wretched to
prolong the line of their sorrows, and cuts off the
fortunate in the midst of their career : he suffers
the aged to survive himself, to outlive life, to
stalk about, the ghost of what he was; and he
aims his arrow at the heart of the young, who
puts the evil day far from him. He delights to
see the feeble carrying the vigorous to the grave,
and the father building the to.nb of his children.
Often when his approaches are least expected, he
bursts at once upon the world, like an earthquake
in the dead of night, or thunder in the serenest
sky. All ages and conditions he sweeps away
without distinction; the young man just entering
into life, high in hope, elated with joy, and pro-

mising to bimself a length of years; the father of
a family from the embraces of his wife and cbil-
dren; the map of the world, when his designs are
ripening to execution, and the long expected
crisis of enjoyment seems to approach. These and
all others are hurried promiscuously off the stage,
and laid without order in the common grave.
Every path in the world leads to the tomb, and
every hour in life hath been to some the last hour.
Without order, too, is the manner of death's
approach. The king of terrors wears a thousand
forms. Pains and diseases-a numerous and a
direful train, compose bis host. Marking out un-
happy man for their prey, they attack the seat of
life, or the seat of understanding; burry him off
the stage in an instant, or make him pine by slow
degrees; blasting the bloom of life, or waiting till
the decline; according to the pathetic picture of
Solomon, " They make the strong men bow them-
selves, and the keepers of the house tremble;
bring the daughters of music low; darken the sun,
and the moon, and the stars; scatter fears in the
way, and make desire itself to fail, until the silver
chord be loosed, and the golden bowl be broken,
when the dust returns to the dust, and the spirit
ascends to the God who gave it.'
Man was made after the image of God; and the
human form divine, the seat of so many heavenly
faculties, graces, and virtues, exhibits a temple
not unworthy of its Maker. Men, in their col-
lective capacity, and united as nations, have dis-
played a wide field of exertion and of glory. The
globe hath been covered with monuments of their
power, and the voice of history transmits their
renown from one generation to another. But
when we pass from the living world to the dead,
what a sad picture do we behold! The fall and
desolation of human nature; the ruins of man;
the dust and ashes of many generations scattered
over the earth. The high and the low; the mighty

and the mean; the king and the cottager, lie
blended together, without any order. A few feet
of earth contain the ashes of him who conquered
the globe; the shadows of the long night stretch
over all alike : the monarch of disorder, the great
leveller of mankind, lays all on the bed of clay in
equal meanness. In the course of time, the land
of desolation becomes still more desolate; the
things that were, become as if they had never
been. Babylon is a ruin, her heroes' are dust;
not a trace remains of the glory that shone over
the earth, and not a stone to tell where the mas-
ter of the world is laid. Such, in general, is the
humiliating aspect of the tomb; but let us take
a nearer view of the house appointed for all living.
Man sets out in the morning of his day, high in
hope, and elated with joy. The most important
objects to him are the companions of his journey.
They set out together in the career of life, and,
after many mutual endearments, walk hand in
hand through the paths of childhood and of youth.
It is with a giddy recollection we look back on the
past, when we consider the number and nature
of those, whom unforeseen disaster and the hand
of destiny have swept from our side. The friends
whom we knew, and valued, and loved; our compa-
nions in the path of life; the partners of our tender
hours, with whom we took sweet counsel, and
walked in company to the house of God, have
passed to the land of forgetfulness, and have no
more connexion with the living world.
Low lies the head that was once crowned with
honour. Silent is the tongue to whose accents we
surrendered up the soul, and to whose language
of friendship and affection we wished to listen for
ever. Beamless is the eye, and closed in night,
- which looked serenity, and sweetness, and love.
The face that was to us as the face of an an-
gel, is mangled and deformed. The heart that

glowed with the purest fire, and beat with the best
affections, is now become a clod of the valley.
But shall it always be so? If a man die, shall
he live again ? Have the wise and the worthy;
the pious and the pure; the generous and the
just; the great and the good, the excellent ones
of the earth, who, from age to age have shone
brighter than the stars of heaven, withdrawn into
the shade of annihilation, and set in darkness to
rise no more? No-while the dust returns to the
earth as it was, the spirit shall return unto God
who gave it.-Ibid.
3.-On Autumn.
1. There is an even-tide in the day-an hour
when the sun retires, and the shadows fall, and
when nature assumes the appearances of sober-
ness and silence. It is an hour from which every
where the thoughtless fly, as peopled only in
their imaginations with images of gloom;-it is the
hour, on the other hand, which, in every age, the
wise have loved, as bringing with it sentiments
and affections more valuable than all the splen-
dours of the day.
Its first impression is to still all the turbulence
of thought or passion which the day may have
brought forth.' We follow, with our eye, the de-
scending sun,-we listen to the decaying sounds
of labour and of toil,-and, when all the fields are
silent around us, we feel a kindred stillness to
breathe upon our souls, and to calm them from the
agitations of society. From this first impression
there is a second which naturally follows it ;-in
the day we are with living men,-in the evening we
begin to live with nature ;-we see the world with-
drawn from us,-the shades of night darken over
the habitations of men, and we feel ourselyes
alone. It is an hour fitted, as it would seem, by
Him who made us, to calm, but with gentle hand,

the throb of every unruly passion; and, while it
veils for a time the world that misleads us, to
awaken in our hearts those legitimate affections
which the heat of the day may have dissolved.
2. There is, in the second place,aneven-tide" in
the year,—when the winds arise, and the leaves
fall, and nature around us seems to sink into de-
cay.
It is a season, in the first place, which tends to
wean us from the passions of the world. Every
passion, however base or unworthy, is yet elo-
quent. It speaks to us of present enjoyment ;-
it tells us of what men bave done and what men
may do, and it supports us every where by the ex-
ample of many around us.
When we go out into the fields in the evening
of the year, a different' voice approaches us. We
regard, even in spite of ourselves, the still but
steady advances of time. Yet a few years, we think,
and all that now bless, or all that now convulse
humanity, will also have perished. The mightiest
pageantry of life will pass,-the loudest notes of
triumph, or of conquest, will be silent in the
grave;"—the wicked, wherever active, “will cease
from troubling," and the weary, wherever suffering,
“ will be at rest.”
Let then the young go out, in these hours,
under the descending sun of the year, into the fields
of nature. Their hearts are now ardent with
hope, with the hopes of fame, of honour, or of hap-
piness; and in the long perspective which is be-
fore them, their imagination creates a world where
all may be enjoyed. Let the scenes which they
now may witness, moderate, but not extinguish
their ambition :--while they see the yearly desola-
tion of nature, let them see it as the emblem of
mortal hope ;-while they feel the disproportion
between the powers they possess, and the time
they are to be employed, let them carry their
ambitious eye beyond the world ;-and whilo, in

these sacred solitudes, a voice in their own bosom
corresponds to the voice of decaying nature, let
them take that high decision which becomes those
who feel themselves the inhabitants of a greater
world, and who look to a being incapable of decay.
Let the busy and the active go out, and pause
for a time amid the scenes which surround them,
and learn the high lesson which nature teaches in
the hours of its fall. They are now ardent with
all the desires of mortality ;--and fame, and in-
terest, and pleasure, are displaying to them their
shadowy promises ;-and in the vulgar race of life,
many weak-and many worthless passions are too
naturally engendered. Let them withdraw them-
selves for a time from the agitations of the world;
let them mark the desolation of summer, and listen
to the winds of winter, which begin to murmur
above their heads. It is a scene which, with all
its power, has yet no reproach ;--it tells them that
such is also the fate to which they must come ;-
that the pulse of passion must one day boat low;
that the illusions of time must pass ;-and," that
the spirit must return to Him who gave it.” It

when the eye becomes dim, and the strength de-

upon the human head its prophetic snow. It is

analogous; and much it becomes, and much it
would profit you, to mark the instructions wbich

the joys they knew, but many of the friends who
gave them. You have entered upon the autumn
of your being, and whatever may have been the
prolusion of your spring, or the warm intemper-
ance of your summer, there is yet a season of
stillness and of solitude, which the beneficence of
Heaven affords you, in which you may meditate
upon the past and the future, and prepare your-
selves for the mighty change which you are soon
to undergo.
If thus you have the wisdom to use the decay-
ing season of nature, it brings with it consolation
more valuable than all the enjoyments of former
days. In the long retrospect of your journey, you
have seen every day the shades of the evening
fall, and every year the clouds of winter gather.
But you have seen also, every succeeding day,
the morning arise in its brightness, and in every
succeeding year the spring return to renovate
the winter of nature. It is now you may under-
stand the magnificent language of Heaven,-it
mingles its voice with that of revelation,-it sum-
mons you, in these bours when the leaves fall, and
the winter is gathering, to that evening study,
which the mercy of Heaven bas provided in the
book of salvation : and, wbile the shadowy valley
opens which leads to the abode of death, it speaks
of that band which can comfort and can save,
and which can conduct to those "green pastures,
and those still waters," where there is an eternal
spring for the children of God.--Alison.

and aş men. Since the people of this country
last met upon a similar occasion, the hopes of
patriotism, and the wishes of humanity have alike
been vain. The giant power which has arisen
in the midst of the civilized world, to mock the
calculations of human wisdom, has, within that
short period, matured his strength, and expanded
his dominion. Wherever his arms have turned,
empires have shrunk before them ; and many
thousands of the human race, who, in the year
that is past, met this day in youth and joy, have
since poured their blood to cement the fabric of
bis despotic throne.
It is in no common hour of peril, that we are now
assembled. A contest more awful than either
we or our fathers bave seen, is rapidly approach-
ing; and that sun which witnesses our meeting,
bas never in bis long career, beheld a time so
pregnant with hope or despair to our country.
It is no common war in which we are engaged,
and no common enemy we are to oppose.
It is
a war in which we are to put to the hazard of the
sword, every blessing of our faith, every honour
of our name, and every glory of our country. It
is an enemy we are summoned to oppose,--whose
positions are kingdoms, and whose march is re-
volution ; before whom the sovereigns of Europe
have bowed their diminished heads; and who
seeks now, on our northern shores, to extinguish
the last spark of order, of freedom, and of jus-
tice among mankind.
Yet, ere the awful hour of conflict begins,-while
the winds of winter are ushering in that mightier
storm which is to convulse or remedy mankind,
let us, in this day of meditation, look to the end
of these things; let us consider what it is that our
patience of evil is now to defend or preserve; and
what are the motives wbich summon us, in the
midst of peril and alarm, to have “ the firm pos-
session of our souls."

1. We are summoned, in the first place, to the
defence of our country ; to preserve the land
which has given us birth, and which contains
every thing for which we live.
Whatever may
be the evils or sufferings of war, they have yet
this fortunate effect,—that they rekindle that love
of our country, which the safety of prosperity,
and the habits of private pursuit are so apt to
relax and impair. But, if this appeal has its
influence even over the savage and the slave,-in
no hour in the history of social life,-in no nation
which has ever risen among mankind,-did that
name ever summon before man so many dread
obligations as it now does before us, in this hour,
and in this country. We have to defend a land,
unhabituated to shame, and hitherto unknown to
conquest;-we have to defend the honours of an-
cient days, and the splendours of present great-
ness ;-we have to defend the opulence which the
industry of our fathers has gained, and the free-
dom which their blood has purchased ;-we have
to defend that constitution, which has poured
the prosperities of nature over a barren land, and
given to our northern isle a splendour unknown
to the regions of the sun ;-we have to defend that
faith in which our infancy was baptized, and in
which, we pray, our dying hours may close;
which was the strength of our fathers, and of
the old time before them," and which has con-
ducted the wise and the virtuous who have preceded
us, to glories beyond the limits of mortality.
2. We are summoned, in the next place, even
to a nobler duty; and in the mighty designs of
Providence, the same valour which is called to
defend our land, is the great means by which we
can relieve the sufferings of the world around
Amid that wreck which we have witnes-
sed of social welfare-amid the dethronement of
kings, and the subjugation of kingdoms--amid
the trembling neutrality of some, and the silent
servility of others,--this country alone hath re-

mained independent and undismayed,-and it is
upon the valour of our arms, that Europe now re-
poses its last hope of returning liberty, and re-
stored honour. Among the nations which surround
us, whom either the force of the enemy has subdued,
or their power intimidated, there is not one vir-
tuous bosom, that does not throb for our success,
_the prayers of millions will follow our banners
into the field, and the arm of the soldier will be
blest by innumerable voices, which can never
reach his ear. If we fail-if the ancient prowess
and intrepidity of our people is gone, -there is
then a long close to all the hopes and all the ho-
nours of humanity; over the fairest portion of the
civilized earth, the tide of military despotism will
roll, and bury, in its sanguinary flood, alike the
monuments of former greatness, and the promises
of future glory. But,-if we prevail; if the hearts
of our people are exalted to the sublimity of the
contest; the mighty spell which has enthralled
'the world will be broken,-the spirit of nature and
of liberty will rekindle ;-and the same blow which
prostrates the enemy of our land, will burst the
fetters of nations, and set free the energies of an
injured world.
Let then the young and the brave of our people
go forth, with hearts inaccessible to fear, and un-
doubting of their cause. Let them look back into
time, and see the shades of their ancestors rising
before them, and exhorting them to the combat.
Let them look around them, and see a subjugated
world the witnesses of their contest, and the part-
ners in their success. Let them look forward into
futurity, and see posterity prostrated before them,
and all the honours and happiness of man depen-
dent upon the firmness of their hearts, and the vi-
gour of their arms. Yes ! let them go forth, and
pour around our isle a living barrier to injustice
and ambition; and, when that tide of anarchy

5.-On the General Thanksgiving, 1814. (2)
The departed year rose upon us in the midst of
calamity and gloom. While the great contest
was as yet doubtful, upon which the fate of the
social world depended, the miseries of want and
of war were settling overy day more deeply over
our land. The usual channels of its industry were
obstructed ;-the sounds of labour and of joy began
to cease in our streets ;--the character even of our
people began to change;—and amid the gloom that
gathered around the poor man's heart, new and
unheard of crimes arose, and the peaceful habita-
tions of men began to be filled with violence and
with blood.
How different are the scenes with which this
auspicious year begins !-The great conflict of the
social world is over;—The mighty are fallen, and
the weapons of war have perished. The cry of
freedom burts from the upfettered earth ; and the
banners of victory wave in all the winds of heaven.
Again, in every corner of our land, the voice of
joy and of gladness is heard. The cheerful sounds
of labour rise again from our streets; the dark
ocean begins again to brighten with our sails; and,
wherever
we turn, there are new subjects of gra-
titude that arise before us.
Our first subject of thankfulness on this day, is
for our Country; that she has survived all the dan-
gers which threatened her; that she has fulfilled
the lofty duty to which she was called. Dear even
to the savage heart is the land of his fathers;
dear to the citizen of civilized ages are the insti-
tutions of national wisdom, and the monuments
of national glory: but, upon no human heart did

the claims of his country ever fall so deep and so
irresistible, as they do now upon the citizen of
this country. Other nations have preceded her in
the road of arts and arms ;-other nations have
wreathed around their brows the laurels of science
and the palms of victory: But the high destiny
to wbich she has of late been called, no other na-
tion has ever shared with her, and all the glories
of former times fade before the moral splendour
wbich now encircles her. She has been called to
guard the fortunes of the human race; to preserve,
amid her waves, the sacan flame that was to re-
lume the world ; and, like the cherubim that
watched the gates of paradise, to turn every way
her flaming sword against the foes of God and
man. These were her duties, and nobly has she
fulfilled them. Through every dark and disastrous
year;-while nation after nation sunk around her;-
whilemonarchsbent their imperial beads beneath the
yoke, and the pulse of moral nature seemed to stand
still in ignominious terror,-She alone hath stood,
insensible to fear, and incapable of submission.-
It is her hand, that amid the darkness of the storm,
hath still steadfastly pointed out the road to liber-
ty; it is her treasures which have clothed every
trembling people with armour for the combat : it
is her sons, (her gallant sons !) who have rushed
into the van of the battle, and first broke the spell
that paralysed the world; and, in these recent
days, it is her commanding voice that has wakened
the slumbering nations of mankind, and sent them
on their glorious march, conquering and to con-
quer.--And now, in the hour of her triumph,-now,
when all that is brave or generous in the human race
bow before her --where is she to be found ? and
what is the attitude in which she presents herself
her children - Oh,-not in the attitude of hu-
man pride, or human arrogance ;--not with the
laurels of victory upon her brow, or with troops
of captives following her chariot wheels :-it is in

the attitude of pious thankfulness; with hands
uplifted in praise, and eyes downcast in gratitude,
These are triumphs, to which the history of the
world has no parallel. In the long line of her
splendour, what hour is to be compared with this?
Which of us does not feel somewhat of her glory
to be reflected upon our own heads? And what
British heart is there, which does not pray that
such may be ever her name, and her character
among mankind.
Yet of so great a day, who would not wish
some monuments to remain !-Some memorials
of thought and of emotion, which might survive
the hour that awakens them :-Let us raise here
three tabernacles in our bosoms : three altars on
which we may place the offerings of our gratitude,
and to which, whatever may be the aspect of
future days, we may retuin to feel again the lofty
sentiments of this. Let the first be raised to our
faith; to that faith “in which our fathers trusted
and were holpen; wbich is able to overcome the
world;" and in the might of which, men and na-
tions are secure of immortal triumph.
Let the next be raised to our Country, to that
country which has so long stood the land-mark of
the human race, and against which “ the winds
and the waves have beat in vain."
Let the last be raised to Those who have Fallen
in this mighty contest, to the memory of the
young and the brave, who have purchased with
their blood, the freedom of their country, and of
mankind. While the bones of that impious host,
that defied the living God, lie scattered over every
foreign land, and whiten unheeded in the winds of
winter, let their ashes be gathered with pious
care, let their monuments rise amongst every
people whom they have saved, and their names
dignify the annals of their country for ever.

valour, and their fall, let the aged of our people,

6.--The Superiority of God's Mercy over that of an
earthly King.
A KING might have the whole of his reign crowded
with the enterprizes of glory; and by the might
of his arms, and the wisdom of his councils, might
win the first reputation among the potentates of
the world; and be idolized through all his pro-
vinces, for the wealth and the security that he had
spread around them ;-and still it is conceivable,
that by the act of a single day in behalf of a single
family; by some soothing visitation of tenderness
to a poor and solitary cottage ; by some deed of
compassion, which conferred enlargement and re-
lief on one despairing sufferer ; by some graceful
movement of sensibility at a tale of wretchedness;
by some noble effort of self-denial, in virtue of
which he subdued his every purpose of revenge,
and spread the mantle of a generous oblivion over
the fault of the man who had insulted and aggrieved
him; above all, by an exercise of pardon so skil-
fully administered, as that instead of bringing bim
down to a state of defencelessness against the
provocation of future injuries, it threw a deeper
sacredness over him, and stamped a more in-
violable dignity than ever on his person and
character :-why, my brethren, on the strength of
one such performance done in a single hour, and
reaching no farther in its immediate effects, than
to one house, or to one individual, it is a most
possible thing, that the highest monarch upon
earth might draw such a lustre around him, as
would eclipse the renown of all his public achieve-

ments ;-and that such a display of magnanimity
or of worth, beaning from the secrecy of his
familiar moments, might waken a more cordial
veneration in every bosom, than all the splendour
of bis conspicuous history ;--and that it might
pass down to posterity, as a more enduring
monument of greatness, and raise him farther
above the level of ordinary praise; and when he
passes in review before the men of distant ages,
may this deed of modest, gentle, unobstrusive
virtue, be at all times appealed to as the most
sublime and touching memorial of his name.
In like manner, did the King eternal, immortal,
and invisible, surrounded as he is with the splen-
dours of a wide and everlasting monarchy, turn him
to our humble habitation; and the footsteps of God
manifest in the flesh, have been on the narrow spot
of ground we occupy; and small though our man-
sion be, amid the orbs and the systems of immen-
sity, hither bath the King of glory bent bis mys-
terious way, and entered the tabernacle of men,
and in the disguise of a servant did he sojourn for
years under the roof which canopies our obscure
and solitary world. Yes, it is but a twinkling atom
in the peopled infinity of worlds that are around
it;-but look to the moral grandeur of the trans-
action, and not to the material extent of the field
upon which it was executed ;--and from the retire-
ment of our dwelling-place, there may issue forth
such a display of the Godhead, as will circulate
the glories of his name amongst all his worship-
pers. Here sin entered. Here was the kind and
unwearied beneficence of a father, répaid by the
ingratitude of a whole family. Here the law of
God was dishonoured, and that too in the face of
its proclaimed and unalterable sanctions. Here
the mighty contest of the attributes was ended ;-
and when justice put forth its demands, and truth
called for the fulfilment of its warnings, and the
immutability of God would not recede by a sin

It was only in that plan of recovery of which
Jesus Christ was the author and the finisher, that
the great adversary of our species met with a wis-
dom which over-matched him. It is true that he
had reared, in the guilt to which he subdued us,
a mighty obstacle in the way of this lofty under-
taking. But when the grand expedient was an-
nounced, and the blood of that atonement, by
which sinners are brought nigh, was willingly of-
fered to be shed for us, and the eternal Son, to
carry this mystery into accomplishment, assumed
our nature, then was the prince of that mighty
rebellion, in which the fate and the history of our
world are so deeply implicated, in visible alarm
for the safety of all his acquisitions :-nor can the
record of this wondrous history carry forward its

ses of a sublime and a superior warfare, in which,

behalf of man, met at every point of their evolu-
tion, by the counterworkings of a rival strength,
and a rival sagacity.
But it would appear from tho records of inspi-
ration, that the contest is not yet ended; that on
the one hand the Spirit of God is employed in mak-
ing for the truths of Christianity, a way into the
human heart, with all the power of an effectual de-
monstration; that on the other, there is a spirit
now abroad, which worketh in the children of dis-
obedience that on the one hand the Holy Ghost
is calling men out of darkness into the marvel-
lous light of the Gospel; and that on the other
hand, he who is styled the god of this world, is
blinding their hearts, lest the light of the glorious
gospel of Christ should enter into them; that
they who are under the dominion of the one, are
said to have overcome, because greater is he that
is in them, than he that is in the world, and that
they who are under the dominion of the other, are
said to be the children of the devil, and to be
under his snare, and to be taken captive by
him at his will. How these respective powers
do operate, is one question. The fact of their
operation, is another. We abstain from the for-
We attach ourselves to the latter, and
gather from it, that the prince of darkness still
walketh abroad amongst üs; that he is still work-
ing his insidious policy, if not with the vigorous
inspiration of hope, at least with the frantic ener-
gies of despair; that while the overtures of re-
conciliation are made to circulate through the
world, he is plying all his devices to deafen and
to extinguish the impression of them; or, in other
words, while a process of invitation and of argu-
ment has emanated from heaven, for reclaiming
men to their loyalty, the process is resisted at all
its points, by one who is putting forth his every
expedient, and wielding a mysterious ascen-
dency, to seduce and to enthral them.

8.-On the Uncertainty of Life.
Every thing buman admits of change and vi-
cissitude; states and empires, arts and sciences,
customs and manners, laws and governments, feel,
without ceasing, this inevitable principle acting
upon them. God, from the throne of his immuta-
bility, sports with all the works and enterprises of
man; and, willing to show us the little value we
should set on things perishable, has decreed that
there should be nothing permanent on the face of
the earth, but the very vicissitude that marks and
agitates it.
But, in the midst of this scene of continued re-
volution, the Scriptures remain as unchangeable
as the source from whence they spring; such as
the first Christians received and understood them,
such are they at this hour; and such will they be
when the heaven and earth have passed away.

EXBRCISES IN THE
Neither the force nor corruption of times can ren.
der them more austere or more indulgent.
They form that everlasting and immutable sys-
tem, announced in the revelation of St. John,
“And I saw another angel from the midst of the hea-
vens, bearing in his hand the everlasting Gospel,
to preach unto all who dwell upon the earth, and
to every nation and kindred, and tongue, and peo-
ple, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
glory unto him, for his judgment is come."
My brethren, the true source of all our delu-
sion is a false and deceitful security of life. Thou-
sands pass their accounts around us, and we are
not instructed : some are struck in our very arms:
our parents, our children, our friends, and yet we
stand as it we had shot into the earth an eternal
root. Even the most sudden transitions from life
to dust, produce but a momentary impression on
the dust that breathes. No examples, however
awful, sink into the heart. Every instant we see
health, youth, beauty, titles, reputation, and for-
tune, disappear like a flash. Still do we pass
gaily on in the broad and flowery way, the same
busy, thoughtless, irreclaimable beings, panting
for every pleasure as before, thirsting for riches
and pre-eminence; rushing on the melancholy ruins
of one another; intriguing for the employments
of those whose ashes are scarce cold ; nay often,
I fear, keeping an eye on the very expiring, with
the infamous view of seizing the earliest moment
to solicit their spoils.
Great God! as if the all-devouring tomb, in-
stead of solemnly pronouncing on the vanity of all
human pursuits, on the contrary emitted sparks
to rekindle all our attachment to a perishable
world! Let me suppose, my brethren, that the
number of man's days were inscribed on his brow!
Is it not clear that an awful certainty of that na-
ture must necessarily beget the most profound and
operative reflection ? Would it be possible to

banish, even for a moment, the fatal term from his
reflection? The nearer he approached it what an
increase of alarm! What an increase of light on
the folly of every thing but immortal good! Would
all his views and aspirings be confined, as they
now are, to the little space that intervenes be-
tween his cradle and his grave; and care and
anxiety, and miserable agitations, be his lot, merely
to die overwhelmed with riches, and blazing with
honours ?
I confess that, however unaccountable it may
be, many a Christian is deluded to lose sight of the
one thing needful. There is some allowance, per-
haps, to be made for youth, that boiling season of
life, when all the passions are impetuous, and the
attractions of the world so intimately felt, and so
natarally obeyed. But to see men, as they de-
cline from their meridian, burning fiercer and
fiercer for that world, shocking the wrinkles on
their brow by an insatiable desire for more wealth
and distinction; sacrificing their glorious revi-
sionary hopes, for acquisitions and attainments
that are on the point of being torn from them ;
promising themselves a kind of immortality here,
as long as they behold a single being one step
nearer to the grave, is such a horrible perversion
of reason and religion, as places it out of the ordi-
nary exertion of the power of God to enlighten
and save them.
This much we all know, that whatever length of
days we promise ourselves, go we must; and, what,
is perhaps equally certain, at the moment we
least expect it. Even examples of instant death in
all the vigour of health, in the very bosom of secu-
rity, are far from being uncommon. The scythe is
suspended over our beads by a slender and imper-
ceptible thread, which many causes, internal and ex-
ternal, often dissever without allowing us a breath
for recollection. But admitting that a misfortune
so terrible is the lot of the fewer number, are we,

therefore, more secure from surprise? There is
not one individual in ten thousand, when obliged
to lie down under illness, however alarming, who
can bring himself to believe it will prove fatal.
No! wedded to this miserable scene of exis-
tence, our hopes are afloat to the last; our eyes
are opened only when they are ready to close for

the most of; perhaps to be divided between the
disposition of worldly affairs and the business of
eternity! An instant of reflection! Just God!

faith the most lively, hope the most firm, love the
most pure! An instant of reflection, when reason

the strong grasp of death. Oh, my brethren, ter-
rible is the fate of those, who are only roused
from a long and criminal security, by the sword,
of his divine justice already gleaming in their
eyes.
But if no danger is to be apprehended while
the thunder of heaven rolls at a distance, believe
me, when it collects over our heads, we may be
fatally convinced that a well-spent life is the only
conductor that can avert the bolt. Let us reflect
that time waits for no man. Sleeping or waking,
our days are on the wing. If we look to those
that are past, they are but as a point; the great
feature of all nature is rapidity of growth, and,
of declension. Ages are renewed, but the figure
of the world passeth away. God only remains
the same. The torrent that sweeps along, runs
at the base of his immutability; and he sees,
with indignation, wretched mortals, as they pass,
along, insulting him by the visionary hope of
sharing that attribute which belongs to Hlim alone.

9.- Comparison between Christ and Mahomet.
Let us consider briefly, what alteration has
happened since the coming of Christ to disturb
and unsettle our judgments with respect to the
Truth of the Gospel. A man, perhaps, who is a
great reader, may be able to produce many in-
stances of imposters since that time, and imagine
that they are all so many dead weights upon the
cause of Revelation. But what is become of
them, and their doctrine ?-they are vanished, and
their place is no where found. What pretence is
there then to set up these revelations? Is God
grown so weak and impotent, that we may sup-
pose these to be his revelations, and intended for
the use of the world, had he not been baffled at
first setting out? If God intends a law for the
use of the world, he is obliged, if I may use the
expression, to publish the law to the world : and
therefore want of such publication evidently shows
that God was not concerned in them, or at least
did not intend that we should be concerned in
them; and therefore it is absurd to instance
such pretences as difficulties in our way, which
in truth are not in our way at all.
And thus the case of Revelation stood, and
the Gospel had no competitor, till the great and
successful imposter Mahomet arose. He indeed
pretended a commission to all the world, and found
means sufficient to publish his pretences. He
asserted his authority upon the strength of Reve-
lation, and endeavoured to transfer the advantages
of the Gospel evidence to himself, having that
pattern before him to copy after. And should we
say
that the Alcoran was never promulged to us
by persons duly commissioned, it may be an-
swered, perhaps, that the Alcoran is as well pub-
lished to us, as the Gospel is to them; which has
some appearanco of an answer, though the fact is

indeed otherwise, for even the Alcoran owns Jesus
for a true propbet.
But with respect to this instance, I persuade
myself it can be no very distracting study to find
reasons to determine our choice. Go to your
Natural Religion; lay before her Mahomet and
bis disciples, arrayed in armour and in blood,
riding in triumph over the spoils of thousands and
tens of thousands, who fell by his victorious
sword. - Show her the cities which he set in
flames, the countries which he ravaged and de-
stroyed, and the miserable distress of all the in-
habitants of the earth. When she has viewed
him in this scene, carry her into his retirement;
show her the prophet's chamber; his concubines
and wives; and let her hear him allege Revelation
and a divine commission, to justify his oppres-
sion and his guilt. When she is tired with this
prospect, then show her the blessed Jesus, hum-
ble and meek, doing good to all the sons of men,
patiently instructing both the ignorant and the
perverse. Let her see him in his most retired
privacies ; let her follow him to the mount, and
bear his devotions and sapplications to God.
Carry her to his table, to view his poor fare, and
hear his heavenly discourse. Let her see him in-
jured, but not provoked; let ber attend him to
the tribunal, and consider the patience with which
be endured the scoffs and reproaches of his ene-
mies. Lead her to his cross; and let her view
him in the agony of death, and hear his last prayer
for his persecutors : Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do!
When Natural Religion has thus viewed both,
ask her, Which is the Prophet of God? But her
answer we have already had, when she saw part
of this scene through the eyes of the centurion
who attended at the cross. By him she spoke,
and said, Truly, this Man was the Son of God.

10.-On the Day of Judgment.
He that stands in a church-yard in the time
of a great plague, and hears the passing-bell
perpetually telling the sad stories of death, and
sees crowds of infected bodies passing to their
graves, and others sick and tremulous, and death
dressed up in all the images of sorrow round
about him, is not supported in his spirit by the
variety of his sorrow: and at doomsday, when the
terrors are universal, besides, that it is, in itself,
so much greater, because it can affright the whole
world, it is also made greater by communica-
tion and a sorrowful influence; grief being then
strongly infectious when there is no variety of state,
but an entire kingdom of fear; and amazement
is the king of all our passions, and all the world
its subjects: and that shriek must needs be terrible,
when millions of men and women at the same in-
stant shall fearfully cry out, and the noise shall
mingle with the trumpet of the archangel, with
the thunders of the dying and groaning heavens,
and the crash of the dissolving world, when the
whole fabric of nature shall shake into dissolution
and eternal ashes. But this general consideration
may be heightened with four or five circumstances.
Consider what an infinite multitude of angels
and men and women shall then appear: it is a
huge assembly, when the men of one kingdom, the
men of one age in a single province are gathered
together into heaps and confusion of disorder;
but then all kingdoms of all ages, all the armies
that ever mustered, all the world that Augustus
Cæsar taxed, all those hundreds of millions that
were slain in all the Roman wars from Numa's
time till Italy was broken into principalities
and small exarchats; all these, and all that can

account if we add the armies of heaven, the nine
orders of blessed spirits, and the infinite numbers
in every order, we may suppose the numbers fit
to express the majesty of that God, and the terror
of that Judge, who is the Lord and Father of all
that unimaginable multitude.
In this great multitude we shall meet all those,
who by their example and their holy precepts
have, like tapers enkindled with a beam of the
Sun of Righteousness, enlightened us, and taught
us to walk in the paths of justice. There we
shall see all those good men whom God sent to
preach to us and recall us from human follies and
inhuman practices : and when we espy the good
man that chid us for our last drunkenness or im-
piety, it shall then also be remembered, how we
mocked at counsel, and were civilly modest at
the reproof, but laughed when the man was gone,
and accepted it for a religious compliment, and
took our leaves, and went and did the same again.
But then things shall put on another face, and
what we smiled at here, and slighted fondly, shall
then be the greatest terror in the world. Men
shall feel that they once laughed at their own
destruction, and rejected health, when it was of-
fered by a man of God upon no other condition,
but that they would be wise, and not be in love
with death. Then they shall perceive that if
they had obeyed an easy and a sober counsel,
they had been partners of the same felicity which
they see so illustrious upon the heads of those
preachers, whose work is with the Lord, and who
by their life and doctrine, endeavoured to snatch
the souls of their friends or relatives from an in-
tolerable misery.
There in that great assembly shall be seen all
those converts, who upon easier terms, and fewer
miracles, and less experience, and a younger grace,

circumstances, have suffered the word of God to
prosper upon their spirits, and have been obe-
dient to the heavenly calling. There shall stand
the men of Nineveh, and they shall stand upright in
judgment ; for they at the preaching of one man
in a less space than forty days returned unto the
Lord their God; but we have heard him call all our
lives, and like the deaf adder stopped our ears against
the voice of God's servants, charm they ever so
wisely. There shall appear the men of Capernaum,
and the Queen of the South, and the men of Berea,
and the first fruits of the Christian Church, and the
holy martyrs; and they shall proclaim to all the
world, that it was not impossible to do the work
of grace in the midst of all our weaknesses and
accidental disadvantages; and that the obedience
of faith, and the labour of love, and the conten-
tions of chastity, and the severities of temperance
and self-denial, are not such insuperable moun-
tains, but that an honest and sober person may
perform them in acceptable degrees, if he have
but a ready ear, and a willing mind, and an honest
heart : and this scene of honest persons shall
make the divine judgment upon sinners more
reasonably and apparently just, in passing upon
them the horrible sentence; for why cannot we
as well serve God in peace, as others served him
in war? Why cannot we love him as well when
he treats us sweetly, and gives us health and
plenty, honours our fair fortunes, reputation or
contentedness, quietness and peace, as others
did upon gibbets and under axes, in the hands of
tormentors and in hard wildernesses, in naked-
ness, and poverty, in the midst of all evil things
and all sad discomforts ? Concerning this no an-
swer can be made.--Jeremy Taylor.

11.-On the Prospect of the Invasion of England by
Napoleon, in 1803.
To form an adequate idea of the duties of this
crisis, it will be necessary to raise your minds to
a level with your station, to extend your views
to a distant futurity, and to consequences the
most certain, though most remote. By a series
of criminal enterprises, by the successes of guilty
ambition, the liberties of Europe have been gra-
dually extinguished : the subjugation of Holland,
Switzerland, and the free towns of Germany, bas
completed that catastrophe : and we are the only
people in the eastern hemisphere who are in
possession of equal laws, and a free constitution.
Freedom, driven from every spot on the continent,
has sought an asylum in a country which she al-
ways chose for her favourite abode : but she is
pursued even here, and threatened with destruc-
tion. The inundation of lawless power, after
covering the whole earth, threatens to follow us
here, and we are most exactly, most critically
placed in the only aperture where it can be suc-
cessfully repelled-in the Thermopylæ of the
world. As far as the interests of freedom are
concerned, the most important by far of sub-
lunary interests, you, my countrymen, stand in
the capacity of the føderal representatives of the
human race; for with you it is to determine (un-
der God) in what condition the latest posterity
shall be born ; their fortunes are intrusted to
your care, and on your conduct at this moment
depend the colour and complexion of their des-
tiny. If Liberty, after being extinguished on the
continent, is suffered to expire here, whence is it
ever to emerge in the midst of that thick night
that will invest it? It remains with you then to
decide whether that Freedom, at whose voice the
kingdoms of Europe awoke from the sleep of ages,

thing great and good; the Freedom which dispelled
the mists of superstition, and invited the nations
to behold their God; whose magic torch kindled
the rays of genius, the enthusiasm of poetry, and
the flame of eloquence; the Freedom which poured
into our lap opulence and arts, and embellished
life with innumerable institutions and improve-
ments, till it became a theatre of wonders; it is
for you to decide, whether this Freedom shall yet
survive, or be covered with a funeral pall, and
wrapped in eternal gloom. It is not necessary
to await your determination. In the solicitude
you feel to approve yourselves worthy of such a
trust, every thought of what is afflicting in war-
fare, every apprehension of danger must vanish,
and you are impatient to mingle in the battle of
the civilized world. Go then, ye defenders of
your country, accompanied with every auspicious
omen; advance with alacrity into the field where
God himself musters the hosts of war. Religion
is too much interested in your success, not to lend
you her aid; she will shed over this enterprise
her selectest influence. While you are engaged
in the field many will repair to the closet, many
to the sanctuary; the faithful of every name will
employ that prayer which has power with God;
the feeble hands, which are unequal to any other
weapon, will grasp the sword of the Spirit; and
from myriads of humble, contrite hearts, the voice
of intercession, supplication, and weeping, will
mingle in its ascent to Heaven, with the shouts
of battle, and the shock of arms.
While you have every thing to fear from the suc-
cess of the enemy, you have every means of pre-
venting that success, so that it is next to impossible
for victory not to crown your exertions. The ex-
tent of your resources, under God, is equal to the
justice of your cause. But should Providence de-
termine otherwise, should you fall in this struggle,
should the nation fall, you will have the satisfac-

bours, and cemented with your blood. And thou,

hereditary valour, that confidence of success which

But it is necessary for the substantial ends of jus-

was this ; they began by winding cords about
their fingers, till the flesh on each hand clung, and
was actually incorporated. They then hammered
wedges of wood and iron between those fingers,
until they crushed and maimed those poor, honest,
and laborious hands, which where never lifted
up to their mouths but with a scanty supply of
provisions.
My lords, these acts of unparalleled cruelty be-
gan with the poor ryots, but if they began there,
there they did not stop. The heads of the vil-
lages, the leading yeomen of the country, respec-
table for their virtues, respectable for their age,
were tied together, two and two, the unoffending
and helpless, thrown across a bar, upon which
they were hung with their feet uppermost, and then
beat with bamboo canes on the soles of those
feet, until the nails started from their toes; and
then with the cudgels of their blind fury, these
poor wretches were afterwards beat about the head,
until the blood gusbed out at their month, nose,
and ears. My lords, they did not stop here. Bam-
boos, rattans, canes, common whips, and scourges
were not suficient. They found a tree in the
country which bears strong and sharp thorns-not
satisfied with those other cruelties, they scourged
them with these. Not satisfied with this, but
searching every thing through the deepest parts
of nature, where she seems to have forgotten her
usual benevolence, they found a poisonous plant,
a deadly caustic, that inflames the part that is
bruised, and often occasions death. This they
applied to those wounds!
My lords, we know that there are men (for so we
are made) whom bodily pain cannot subdue. The
mind of some men strengthens in proportion as the
body suffers. But people who can bear up against
their own tortures, cannot bear up against those
of their children and friends. To add, therefore,
to their sufferings, the innocent children were

faces of their parents. They frequently bound
the father and the son, face to face, arm to arm,
body to body, and then flogged till the skin was
torn from the flesh: and thus they had the de-
vilish satisfaction of knowing that every blow
must wound either the body or the mind : for if
one escaped the son, his sensibility was wounded
by the knowledge he had that the blow had fallen
upon his father; the same torture was felt by the
father, when he knew that every blow that missed
him had fallen upon his unfortunate son.
My lords, none but wicked, bloody, and rapa-
cious persons can be employed to exercise sach
tasks. Therefore, I charge Mr. Hastings with
having destroyed the whole system of government
-I charge him with having delegated away that
power which the act of parliament had directed
him to preserve unalienably in himself-I charge
him with having alienated the fortunes of widows
-I charge him with having, without right, title, or
purchase, taken away the lands of orphans, and
given them to the very persons under whose protec-
tion those orphans were-I charge him with having
given those very Zemindaries to the most wicked
of persons, knowing his wickedness; with having
committed to him that great country, and with
having wasted the country, destroyed the landed
interest, cruelly harassed the peasants, burnt
their houses, and destroyed their crops.--I charge

bond of social and natural humanity; and all the
Commons of England resenting, as their own, the
indignities and cruelties that have been offered to

My lords, permit me to say, neither do we want
a tribunal; for a greater tribunal than the present,
no example of antiquity, nor any thing in the
world can supply. My lords, here we see, vir-
tually in the mind's eye, the sacred minister of

whose power you exercise. In that invisible
authority, which we all feel the spirit and the life
of, we see the protecting power of His Majesty.
We have here an illustrious and virtuous train of

the honour of their ancestors, and the honour of

that of their institutions the very vital spirit is
charity; and that it so much hates oppression,

human form, he did not appear in greatness of
majesty, but in sympathy to the lower people,

ment which he who is Master of nature, and who
appeared in our form, has established, of the
flock that feed, and those that feed them, he who
is called first among them is and ought to be the
servant of the rest.
My lords, these are our securities; we rest upon

Therefore it is that, ordered by the Commons

the Carnatic, (2)
When at length Hyder Ali found that he had
to do with men who either would sign no conven-
tion, or whom no treaty and no signature could
bind, and who were the determined enemies of
human intercourse itself, he decreed to make the
country possessed by these incorrigible and pre-
destinated criminals, a memorable example to
mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy recesses
of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the
whole Carpatic an everlasting monument of ven-
geance, and to put perpetual desolation as a bar-
rier between him and those, against whom the
faith which holds the moral elements of the world
together, was no protection. He became at length
so confident of his force, so collected in his might,
that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful
resolution. Having terminated his disputes with
every enemy, and every rival, who buried their
mutual animosities in their common detestation
against the creditors of the nabob of Arcot, he
drew from every quarter whatever a savage fero-
city could add to his new rudiments in the arts of
destruction; and compounding all the materials
of fury, havoc, and desolation, into one black
cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of
the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these
evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this me-
nacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon,
it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole tor-
rent of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic.
Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of wbich no
eye bad seen, no heart conceived, and which no
tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of
war before known or heard of, were mercy to that
new havoc. A storm of universal fire blasted

torn from children, husbands from wives, enve-

goading spears of drivers, and the trampling of
pursuing horses, were swept into captivity in an

to evade this tempest, fled to the walled cities.
But escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell

The alms of the settlement in this dreadful
exigency, were certainly liberal; and all was done

stretched out its hands for food. For months

some of the circumstances of this plague of hun-
ger. Of all the calamities which beset and way-
lay the life of man, this comes the nearest to our
heart, and is that wherein the proudest of us all
feels himself to be nothing more than he is : but I
find myself unable to manage it with decorum;
these details are of a species of horror so nauseous
and disgusting; they are so degrading to the suf-
ferers and to the hearers; they are so humiliating

Foreighteen months, without intermission, this de-
struction raged from the gates of Madras to the gates
of Tanjore; and so completely did these masters
in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious son,
absolve themselves of their impious vow, that when
the British armies traversed, as they did, the Carna-
tic for hundreds of miles in all directions, through
the whole line of their march they did not see one
man, not one woman, not one child, not one four-
footed beast of any description whatever. One
dead uniform silence reigned over the whole re-

(a) I FEEL, my lords, a peculiar pride io standing
before this ancient tribunal in the character in
which I now have the honour to appear, namely,
that of one of the managers of a prosecution voted
by the representatives of the people, in the name
of the Commons of Great Britain.
When I say I feel a pride on the occasion, I
hope that no man will suppose that I mean any
personal vanity, but that proper pride which every
British subject of every degree must naturally
feel in having so striking an example that what
is called the Lex et Consuetudo Parliamenti, the
bulwark of the liberties, rights, and privileges,
and of every thing that is dear to Englishmen,
has provided such a means of bringing criminals
of the highest rank to public trial, and, if found
guilty, to condign punishment.
(a) The tone and expression throughout this introduction should ex-
hibit more confidence than introductions generally require; but it
should be a confidence devoid of arrogance, and evincing a proper de-
ference to the judges.

It is a pride, however, that is not personal! It
is, thank God, most nobly the reverse of all that
is sordid, diminutive, equivocal, and base! It
reaches, and it decorates all my friends—all with
whom I actthe age and the nation !--Other Im-
peachments have originated with the party then
triumphant in the House of Commons: it is the
"obvious boast of the present business, to have
begun with those too truly not there predominant;
and I know not, on which side admiration may
most fondly lean-whether over those whose in-
ventive ardour opened the career-or those whose
ingenuous candour so well and so fairly aided it
to this Edifying Conclusion !
For surely it is grand and edifying indeed,
to display the collective vigour of national hu-
manity paramount over all !--to vaunt the digni-
fying, because useful, instance of two Political
Parties uniting, unexpectedly, in the point of reci-
procal disinterestedness !-finely foregoing every
fair purpose of allowable self-gratification !
sheathing those arms they both bad wielded so
ably to mutual annoyance; and attacking, with
a different array, what they deemed, whether right
or wrong was to be proved, the common enemy to
Truth and Feeling ! -
At such an effort in the admiring view of surround-
ing nations, it were impious, if possible, to be calm.
Indifference were insensibility--that profaned each
sacred influence in heaven and earth. There is
no collective virtue superior in the history of
England-in the history of man! It springs from
motives of all others the most high and pure-the
good of others;--and it flows to consequences of
all others the most gratifying and enduring--the
well-founded approbation of ourselves.

and Alexander the Great. (4)
Mr. Hastings has been lately compared to a
conqueror whose fame filled the universe :-(5)
a character so exalted as to dispute precedence
with the second person in the kingdom, has assi-
milated Warren Hastings to Alexander the Great.
But if any resemblance were to be found, it could
not be to Alexander when his mercies and his
victories kept an equal pace ;-it could not be to
the generous and forgiving conqueror :--the like-
ness must be meant to Alexander after a debauch;
-to Alexander in petulant wantonness setting
temples on fire ;-to Alexander when his follies
and his crimes had excited horror and contempt
sufficient to obscure the radiance of his former
glories. In the first points of the comparison
there is not a shadow of resemblance; in the lat-
ter part of the parallel there is all the justice that
can be required.

Misery stalked hand in hand through uncultivated
fields, and deserted villages. There were found
only the aged and infirm, who were unable to fly;
robbers prepared to kill; and tygers, whose fe-

lent Rajah, and of the unassuming and judicious

you, by making many preliminary observations.
Such general remarks as it is in my power to make,
would only weaken what has been already urged
by the right honourable gentleman, who is the
principal mover of the impeachment;(8)—whose
genius exceeds every thing but his disposition-
who understands and feels for all-through whom,
and by whom, so great an embodied stand has
been made in defence of the rights of man against
man's oppression. I may however, without injury
to the general cause, and without exposing too
much of your lordships' patience, say a few words,
both upon the subject of the impeachment in ge-
neral, and the particular situation of myself and
my honourable colleagues, who have been ap-
pointed to conduct it.
I can speak from my own heart, and declare
most solemnly, that I find there no private in-
centive to the part that I have taken in this
impeachment; and I verily believe, I may safely
say, that all my honourable colleagues, as well
as myself, are actuated solely by the zeal which
they entertain for the public welfare, and by their
honest solicitude for the honour of their country
and the happiness of those who are under its do-
minion and protection. With such subjects in
view, I really lost sight of Mr. Hastings, who,
however great in other respects, is too insignificant
to be mixed with such important considerations.
The unfortunate gentleman at the bar, is no
mighty object in my mind. Amidst the series of
mischiefs, to my sense, seeming to surround him,
what is he but a petty Nucleus involved in its
lamina, scarcely seen or thought of ! In truth,
the prosecution is not “ begotten in prejudice, or
nursed in envy.” It is founded on the clearest con-
viction of the wrongs which the natives of Hin-
dostan have suffered through the mal-administra-
tion of those in whose hands the country had
placed extensive powers, which ought to have

but which have been used by the prisoner at the
bar, for the shameful purposes of oppression.
In looking round for an object fit to be held out
to the world as an example of national justice,
your lordships must necessarily fix your eyes
upon Mr. Hastings. He is the cause of the de-
gradation of our character in India, and of the
wrongs of its devoted inhabitants; and he is the
only victim that can atone for the calamities:
which he bas occasioned.
But while I call for justice upon the prisoner,
I would wish also to do him justice. I would be
sorry that the weight and consequence of the
Commons of Great Britain, in whose name the
prosecution has been set on foot, should operate
to his prejudice. Indeed, whilst he has such up-
right judges as your lordships, it is impossible
that any thing could injure him but the clearest
and most unequivocal proofs of guilt. (a)It is
not the peering suspicion of apprehended guilt.-
It is not any popular abhorrence of its wide-

madness had ravaged thus with wide-spread war
what desolating foreign foe—what disputed succes-
sion-what religious zeal-what fabled monster had
stalked abroad, and with malice and mortal enmity.
to man, had withered with the gripe of death every
growth of nature and humanity--all the means of
delight, and each original, simple principle of bare
existence? The answer would be, if any answer
dare be given, No, alas ! not one of these things!
No desolating foreign foe !--no disputed succes-
sion !-no religious superserviceable zeal !- This
damp of death is the mere effusion of British amity
-we sink under the pressure of their support--we
writhe under the gripe of their pestiferous alliance!
Thus they suffered, in barren anguish, and in-
effectual bewailings. And-O audacious fallacy!
“ What,” (a) says the defence of Mr. Hastings,
“ What cause was there for any incidental ills
but their own resistance ?"
The cause was Nature in the first-born prin-
ciples of man. It grew with his growth, it
strengthened with his strength; it taught him to
understand; it enabled him to feel! For where
there is human fate, can there be a penury of
human feeling? Where there is injury, will there
not be resentment? Is not despair to be followed
by courage ? The god of battles pervades and
penetrates the inmost spirit of man, and rousing
him to shake off the burden that is grievous, and
the yoke that is galling, will reveal to him the law
written in his heart, and the duties and privileges
of his nature, the grand universal compact of man
with man!

the defence of Mr. Hastings," in a different tone of voice from the
word that precedes, and those that follow. See page 95.

That this representation is not exaggerated,
will appear from the account given by Major
Naylor, who succeeded Colonel Hannay, and
who had previously saved him from the vengeance
which the assembled ryots, or husbandmen, were
about to take on their oppressor. So deeply
were they impressed with a sense of their wrongs,
that they would not even accept of life from those
who had rescued Colonel Hannay! They pre-
sented themselves to the swords of the soldiery;
and as they lay bleeding on the banks of their
sacred stream, they consoled themselves with the
ghastly hope that their blood would not descend
into the soil, but that it would ascend to the view
of the God of Nature, and there claim a retribu-
tion for their wrongs. (10)
This was British Justice !--this was British
humanity! Mr. Hastings insures to the allies of
the Company, in the strongest terms, their pros-
perity, and his protection. The former he secures
by sending an army to plunder them of their wealth
and to desolate their soil! His protection is
fraught with a similar security, like that of a vul-
ture to a lamb, grappling in its vitals; thirsting for
its blood; scaring off each petty kite that hovers
round ; and then with an insulting perversion of
terms, calling sacrifice protection! An object for
which history seeks for any similarity in vain.
The deep-searching annals of Tacitus-the lumi-
nous philosophy of Gibbon,--all the records of
man's transgressing, from Original Sin to the pre-
sent period, dwindle into comparative insignifi-
cance of enormity ; both in aggravation of vile
principles, and extent of their consequential ruin.

heavier chains, and severer punishments ;--there,
where that flag was flying which was wont to

but ordered an inquiry into the circumstances of

stated to the council that it would revive those
animosities that had subsisted between the Be-

joined in the same words “ that the Majesty of
Justice ought not to be approached without soli-

mation by His Majesty, Ireland is in a state of war
of course, and without the assent of the Houses of
Parliament; he knows that the supply of that war
depends not on the Parliament of Ireland, but of
Great Britain, and therefore the interference of
the Parliament of Ireland on that subject is little
more than the declaration of a sentiment. It is
not the Isle of Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope,
the Mysore country, nor the dominionsof Tippoo,
nor yet the feathers of Britain's western wing, that
engage the attention of Ireland. It is her own
internal freedom and constitution; it is her own
idea of that internal freedom and constitution, not
such as British ministers, who have invaded that
constitution, too often shall hold forth ; nor such
as English or Scotch metaphysicians who made
chains for America and called them her constitu-
tion, and are ready now to cast links for Ireland
with the foreign stamp of Irish liberty ; but that
constitution which she herself, Ireland, feels, com-
prehends, venerates, and claims. It is for the pre-
servation of this constitution that she is interested
in British wars; she considers the British empire
a great western barrier against invasion from other
countries invasion on what? invasion on her
liberties, on her rights and privileges; invasion
ou self-legislation, the parent and protectress of
them all. She hears the ocean protesting against
separation, but she hears the sea likewise pro-
testing against Union; she follows, therefore, her
physical destination, and obeys the dispensations
of providence.
On these principles, I suppose the dissent of
Ireland on the subject of war highly improbable, as
it is uninstanced ; but I should attribute, like the
minister, infallibility to those councils that engago
their country in a war, should I suppose the dis-
sent of Ireland on such a subject at all times to be
fatal. Happy had it been for Great Britain ; happy

Commons who in the last century took away your
trade, and in the present your constitution, as for
that King, Lords, and Commons, who have restored
both ? Well—the minister has destroyed this con-
stitution; to destroy is easy: the edifices of the
mind, like the fabrics of marble, require an age
to build, but ask only minutes to precipitate; and,
as the fall is of no time, so neither is the effect of

country, are withdrawn from that of sympathy,
from that of opinion. He changes the sphere not
only of their action, but of their character and of
their sensations.
I will not say that one hundred Irish gentlemen
will act ill, where any man would act well; but
never was there a situation in which they bad so
much temptation to act ill, and so little to act
well-great expense and consequent distresses,
They will be in situation a sort of gentlemen of

the other, suspended between both-and belong-

The minister sees, I do not, British merchants

multitudes, themselves and families. He mentions
not what description of manufacturers—who from
Birmingham, who from Manchester; no matter;
he cares not; he goes on asserting, and asserting
with great ease to himself, and without any obli-
gation to fact. Imagination is the region in which
he delights to disport. Where he is to take away
your parliament; where he is to take away your

16.-Peroration to the same Speech.
What he cannot reconcile to your interest, he
affects to reconcile to your honour. He, the mi-
nister, (“his budget crammed with corruption,")
proposes to you to give up the ancient inheritance
of your country, to proclaim an utter and blank
incapacity to make laws for your own people,
and to register this proclamation of incapacity in
an act which inflicts on this ancient nation an
eternal disability ; and he accompanies these
monstrous proposals by undisguised terror and
unqualified bribery; and this he calls no attack
on the honour and dignity of the kingdom.
The thing he proposes to buy is what cannot
be sold,-LIBERTY! For it he has nothing to
give,-every thing of value which you possess
you obtained under a free constitution-part with
it, and you must be not only a slave, but an idiot.
His propositions not only go to your dishonour,
but they are built upon nothing else. He tells
you, (it is bis main argument,) that you are unfit to
exercise a free constitution, and he affects to prove
it by experiment. “ Jacobinism grows,” says he,
“ out of the very state and condition of Ireland.”
I have heard of parliament impeaching ministers,
but here is a minister impeaching parliament.
He does more ; he impeaches the parliamentary
constitution itself: he proposes to you to sub-
stitute the British Parliament in your place, to
destroy the body that restored your liberties, and
restore that body which destroyed them. Against

on the Regency Question. (18)
HAVING, then, by the first resolution ascertained
the deficiency in the personal exercise of the
regal power, the next step which I shall submit
is, the supply of that deficiency. This melan-
choly duty falls on the two Houses of the Irish
Parliament, whether you consider them as the
only surviving estates capable of doing an act, or
as the bighest formed description of His Majesty's
people of Ireland. The method whereby I propose
these great assemblies shall supply this deficiency,
is -Address.
Most undoubtedly it is not the method pur-
sued by Great Britain; but the diversity arises
from obvious causes. The declaration of right is
omitted in our proceedings : Why? Because we
know of no claim advanced against the privileges
of the people. A declaration of right, in such a
case, would be a declaration without a meaning;
it would bespeak an attack which has not been
made, and would be a defence against no inva-
sion--it would be a false alarm, and would hold
out false signals of public danger in times of
per-
fect safety, confounding and perplexing the pub-
lic mind; so that in the moment of real attack the
people would not be forthcoming. I object to a
declaration of right in Ireland, as bad husbandry
of popular artillery. I object to it also as at-
tempting to convey to posterity historic evidence
against the constitutional principles of the second
person in His Majesty's dominions.
As to your government you restore it, and re-
store it to all its energies, that the concern of the
people for the indisposition of their King, may

administration of public affairs. You also mani-
fest your attachment to the royal family, not only
by renewing the governinent in the person of the
heir apparent, but by renewing it in a manner
honourable to both prince and people.
Gentlemen have called this an important day-
I will add to the expression-I will call it a proud
day for Ireland. She has deserved it; she has
struggled hard for her independency, and she is
now disposed to make a judicious use of it. It
is not a cold, deliberate act, supplying a deficiency
in the regal function; it is not a judicious, but
languid nomination of a substitute for the exer-
cise of monarchical power. This country annexes
a passion to her proceedings, and kindles in love
and affection to the House of Brunswick; and in
restoring her constitutional rights and privileges,
she now gathers in a harvest which she shares
with her princes.

18.–Speech of the Attorney General, Mr. Fitz-
gibbon, (afterwards Lord Clare,) on the same
subject.
SIR,-We are now to consider whether the ad-
dress moved for be an instrument sufficient to
convey to his Royal Highness the regal authority;
and whether it be such an address as we ought to
present. I shall, in as few words as possible,
state my opinion. And first, I maintain that
the crown of Ireland and the crown of England
are inseparably and indissolubly united. Se-
condly, I do maintain that the Irish Parliament is
perfectly and totally independent of the British
Parliament. The first position is your security;
the second is your freedom; and when gentlemen
talk any other language than this, they tend either
to the separation of the crowns, or the subjuga-
tion of your parliament--they invade either your

security or your liberty: finally, the only security
of your liberty is your connexion with Great
Britain, and gentlemen who risk breaking that
connexion, must make up their minds to a union.
By a late law you enact, that all bills which
shall pass the two houses here, and which shall
be certified into England, and which shall be re-
turned under the great seal of England, without
any alteration whatsoever, shall pass into law,
and no other.
By this law, the great seal of England is the
organ by which the king of England speaks, and
the great seal of Ireland is the organ by which
the king of Ireland speaks. Let me for a moment
suppose, that we, in the dignity of our indepen-
dence, appoint a regent for Ireland, being a dif-
ferent person from the regent of England, and
suppose we should go farther, and desire him to
give his royal assent to bills, he would say, “My
good people of Ireland, you have by your own
law made the great seal of England absolutely
and essentially necessary to be affixed to each
bill before it passes in Ireland; that seal is in the
hands of the chancellor of England, who is a very
sturdy fellow; that chancellor is an officer under
the regent of England, I have no manner of au-
thority over him, and so, my very good people of
Ireland, you had better apply to the regent of
England, and request that he will order the chan-
cellor of England to affix the great seal of Eng-
land to your bills, otherwise, my very good people
of Jreland, I cannot pass them.”
If the House shall, by force of an address, upon
the instant, and without any communication from
England, invest a regent with powers undefined,
I do say, that when the moment of refle ion
comes, it will startle the boldest adventurers in
England when this conduct of ours shall be re-
lated.

Sir, I will not yield to any man in personal re-
spect and attachment to the Prince of Wales.
No man can think more highly of him than I do ;
but I will manifest my respect and attachment to
the Prince of Wales, by endeavouring to preserve
entire the imperial crown, which in the course of
nature will descend to him, and which we are now,
by an act of criminal rashness, about to deprive
of its best appendage.
I will not insult the Prince of Wales by an ad-
dress, which cannot confer on him the shadow of
royal power ; I wish to invest him with substan-
tial royal powers, which he may execute consis-
tently with the laws by which he is to govern.
But suppose that the prince does not accept
the regency in England-suppose your address
should reach him before he is actually invested
with royal powers in England, in what situation
do you put him ? You call on him in defiance of
two acts of parliament which make the crowns
inseparable, to dethrone the king bis father! You
call
upon
him to do an'act now at which hereafter
his nature will revolt.
Sir, I have said, and I must repeat it, no man
can have a higher opinion of the virtues and
great endowments of His Royal Highness, than I
have; I doubt not they will be the brighest orna-
ments of the British crown whenever he shall
wear it; but they are false friends of the Prince
of Wales, who shall advise him to receive an ad-
dress that may give him cause to curse the hand
which presented it.
I know, Sir, that liberties indecent in the ex-
treme have been taken with the name of that
august personage-I know it has been whispered
that every man who shall vote against this ad-
dress will be considered as voting against him ;
but if any man has had the guilt and folly to poison
the human mind with such an insinuation, I will
trust to his good sense to distinguish his friends;

I will trust to his good sense to distinguish
whether they are his friends, who wish to guard
the imperial rights of the British crown, or they
who would stake them upon the momentary and
impotent triumph of an English party. What
matters it to the prince whether he receives royal
authority by bill or by address? Is there a man
who will presume to libel him, and assert, that
the success of this measure will be a triumph to
him? In his exalted station he will triumph only
in governing a great nation with honour to himself,
and with advantage to bis people. If you wish
to pay a compliment to the Prince of Wales,
guard the imperial rights of the British crown. He
can have no triumph but that of governing a great
and happy people; if you give him a triumph,
guard their rights, and guard the rights of the
crown,
If you make the Prince of Wales your Regent,
and grant him the plenitude of power, let it be
done by bill; otherwise I see such danger that I
deprecate the measure proposed. I call upon
the country-gentlemen of Ireland; this is not a
time to think of every two-penny grievance, every
paltry disappointment sustained at the castle of
Dublin. If any man has been aggrieved by the
viceroy, and chooses to compose a Philippic on
the occasion, let him give it on the debate of a
turnpike-bill, where it will not be so disgraceful
to the inan who utters it, as it will be on the pre-
sent occasion.

has proceeded in criminal error to such a rash
and desperate excess as to attack the ascertained
privileges of our parliament and the dearest rights
of his country-he has endeavoured by his argu-
ment to take away from this country the power of
choosing a regent, and has sought to cast an air
of silly ridicule and trifling scorn on her appoint-
ment, and he has also endeavoured with equal
error and temerity to give to another country the
power of imposing a regent upon you, and by its
own authority, and he thinks he has succeeded to
prove his desperate conclusions, when he shows,
or fancies he shows, that the undoubted rights of
his country may be destroyed, and yet all the pe-
dantry of legal form punctiliously adhered to.
It is a great objection to the doctrine of this
night, that it tends to destroy allegiance. The
people of this country will be loyal to their King,
but when you set up baubles in his place; when
you set up phantoms that can give no protection,
and are only the stamps of authority; when, in-
stead of the royal family wearing the Irish crown,
they are directed to contemplate as the object of
affection, an oflicer with the great seal in his hand;
will the advocate for such doctrine answer for the
affections of His Majesty's people of Ireland ?-
thus perplexed and confounded by signals, in-
stead of princes, and the dead letter of authority,
instead of the living objects of affection. The
people have a pride in their King, and will not
tranfer their love; but on the contrary will kindle
at the quibble that would set in his place the great
seal as an object of their allegiance, and the sub-
stitute as their monarch.
Gentlemen talk of government !- What govern-
ment can preserve authority on such terms! and
what man can entertain a love for the government
of his country, when such a barren quibble in the
place of the Irish crown, is offered to his contem-
plation, and such a wretched phantom is pre-

tended not to command, but to balk the loyalty
of a sanguine people! Depend upon it, this ar-
gument does not go more to extinguish the King of
Ireland, than the allegiance of the Irish people;
they will not be loyal to the English chancellor,
nor the English great seal, nor the officers of the
crown, English or Irish, whom chance has made
the ministers of the will of the monarch; they
demand a real living object of attachment, and
expect it not in the fiction, but in the family of
their sovereign, in the House of Brunswick, the
hereditary kings, by the laws and constitution of
this realm.
These crown lawyers that undermine the Irish
throne are not aware of the mischief of their offen-
sive doctrine; they do not know what valuable
passions they extinguish, what principle of attrac-
tion they destroy; they do not consider the effect
of their sophistry on the human mind, and its
cold, pestilential consequences in the breast of
every subject. He cannot detect, perhaps, but he
revolts at the errors of such doctrine, and turns
from phantoms set up in the place of princes, and
refuses his allegiance to idols, which the pedants
of the profession advance in the place of the
Sovereign of Ireland, or the family of their Sove-
reign.
Could I agree with the principles of the argu-
ment of this night; could I banish from this
question all recollection of the royal family and
the people; could I conceive that the best system
for Ireland would be a government without mo-
narchical power, and a parliament without delibe-
rate properties; could I imagine that on the ques-
tion of an Irish regency we should keep clear of
two considerations, the Regent and the kingdom,
and only attend to our connexion with Great
Britain, yet I should abjure this doctrine, and
this language, as fatal to this principle.

wretched theme for sophistry ?-Why make it a
constant opportunity for rebuke ?-Why make it
a pretence for the humiliation of Ireland - Why
introduce it where it is not in danger, and resort to
it as a pretence for scolding the people of Ire-
land ?-Why interrupt a proud day like this with
monstrous doctrine that affects to ground itself on
a connexion, to which it is highly prejudicial ?
I will banish for a moment from my mind, the
principles of public virtue, of allegiance to the
crown, and love to the people; I will allow that
such a question as the present should be ruled
exclusively with a view to connexion ; yet, as the
public mind is already impregnated with those
patriot and loyal principles, and as we cannot
destroy the criminal tendency of patriotism and
allegiance in the minds of our fellow-subjects, let
us capitulate with virtues which we cannot extir-
pate, and instead of placing them in contrast, let
us set them in harmony with connexion-tell
your countrymen that your connexion with Great
Britain is the source of her liberty-make thom
proud of standing by the side of England-tell
them that all their passions and interests can be
completely gratified and respectively adhered to
with the strictest conformity to every principle of
connexion, and that the boldest exercise of freedom,
and the noblest indulgence of every royal affec-
tion, are perfectly conformable to the closest
bands with the British connexion. This is the
way to promote the connexion : nations are
governed not by interest only, but by passion also:
and the passion of Ireland is freedom. So much
so is her passion, that if any Parliament could
bring this nation bound hand and foot to the feet
of the throne, with a proffer of her liberties, a wise
monarch who loved power, would reject the
power of her servitude, and set her free to com-
mand her absolutely.

20. Arguments against the Union.
SIR,-I feel no ordinary sensation on this
question's being again introduced to the conside-
ration of parliament-it was ushered into the last
parliament with the same boyish boasting, which
now accompanies it, and rejected with the same
contumely which ultimately awaits it. Without
any change in the circumstances of the country,
without the production of any new argument, the
same men who fled, like detected thieves, at the
close of the last session, and who, in the percipi.
tance of their flight, stumbled over, and over-
turned all public decency and parliamentary de-
corum, now exhibit themselves to challenge the
national observation, and to brand with the name
of faction every man who has honesty and courage
to spurn their degrading purposes. I will unmask
the men who have dared to come into the midst of
parliament and people to pamper their liberties
by sordid bribery, and to subdue their spirits by
lawless force, and if I cannot excite the feelings
of honour, or virtue in their hearts, I will call the
the blooming blush of shame into their cheeks.
You are told with puny sophistry, that you
ought at least to discuss the question; what is
meant by this? If by discussion is meant, that
we should discuss the detail without examining
the principle, I utterly refuse it. We now stand
on the high ground of national independence se-
cured by solemn compact, for the purpose of
treating about, we know not what possible ad-
vantages; and this is called discussion. In an-
swer to this demand, I say first, you have not
stated any one definite advantage which Ireland
can gain, or evil which she can avoid, to induce her

I will not admit the principle, because it is a
barter of liberty for money, even supposing your
advantages as real as they are visionary. The
nation which enters into such a traffic is besotted.
Freedom is the parent of wealth, and it is an act of
parricide to sacrifice the constitution which gene-
rates and nourishes your commerce, for the sup-
posed improvement of that commerce.
This is indeed, under all its circumstances, the
most extravagant demand ever made by one nation
from another. Ireland, a happy little island,
with a population of between four and five mil-
lions of people-hardy, gallant, and enthusiastic-
possessed of all the means of civilization-agri-
culture and commerce well pursued and under-
stood-laws well arranged and administered-a
constitution fully recognized and established, her
revenues, her trade, ber manufactures thriving
beyond the hope or example of any other country
of her extent--within these few years advancing
with a rapidity astonishing even to herself; not
complaining of her deficiency in any of these
respects, but enjoying and acknowledging her
prosperity, is called on to surrender them all to
the control of whom? To a great and powerful
continent, to whom nature intended her as an ap-
pendage ? To a mighty people, totally exceeding
her in all calculation of Cerritory and population?
No, but to another happy little island placed
beside her in the bosom of the Atlantic, of little
more than double her territory and population,
and possessing resources not nearly so superior
to her wants; and this too an island which has
grown great, and prosperous, and happy, by the
very same advantages which Ireland enjoys-a
free and independent constitution, and the pro-
tection of a domestic superintendant parliament.

The public will not easily forget the indecent
precipitation with which the message from the

for the ordinary vote of thanks to you, Sir, for

forget, not the absence, but the disgraceful flight

His Excellency for the first time thought proper

making quite so great a sacrifice, from mere per-

From those acts of phrensy you plunge into the

madness has desolated the face of the world,
when all establishment is staggering under the

separate parliaments, because we have done so
for ages; and, therefore, when I see a modern
Solon taking to pieces the different parts of our

you have a common king, would it not be better
à priori to have a common parliament ?" I laugh

extracts the principle, by which countries are to
be harmoniously governed. As soon would I
listen to the shallow observer of nature, who
should say that there is a centrifugal force im-
pressed on our globe, and therefore, lest we should

of the Almighty, there are impulses from whose
wholesome opposition Eternal Wisdom bas de-
clared the law, by which we revolve in our proper
sphere, and at our proper distance. So I say to
the political visionary, from the opposite forces
which you object to, I see the wholesome law of
imperial connexion derived I see the two coun-
tries preserving their due distance from each
other, generating, and imparting heat, and light,

words. You have not been elected for this pur-
pose-you are appointed to act under the consti-
tution, not to alter it.--You are appointed to ex-
ercise the functions of legislators, and not to trans-
fer them; and if you do so, your act is a dissolu-
tion of the government-you resolve society into
its original elements, and no man in the land is
bound to obey you. Sir, I state doctrines which
are not merely founded in the inscrutable laws of
justice and reason-I state not merely the opi-
nions of the ablest men who have written on the
science of government, but I state the practice of
our constitution as settled at the era of the revo-
lution, and I state the doctrine under which the
House of Hanover derives its title to the throne.
Has the king a right to transfer his crown? Is he
competent to annex it to the crown of Spain, or
of any other country? No;-but he may abdicate
it; and every man who knows the constitution,
knows the consequence: the right reverts to the
next in succession-if they all abdicate, it reverts
to the people. The man who questions this doc-
trine, in the same breath must arraign the sove-
reign on the throne as an usurper. Are you com-
petent to transfer your legislative rights to the
French council of five hundred ? Are you com-
petent to transfer them to the British parliament?
I answer, No. When you transfer, you abdicate,
and the great original trust results to the people
from whom it issued.--Yourselves you may ex-
tinguish, but parliament you cannot extinguish-
it is enthroned in the hearts of the people—it is en-
shrined in the sanctuary of the constitution--it is
immortal as the island which it protects. As well
might the frantic suicide hope that the act which
destroys his miserable body, should extinguish his
eternal soul. Again, I therefore warn you, do
not dare to lay your hands on the constitution;
it is above your powers.

Ireland,” say the arguments of this night, “has
in her greatness a tendency to separation.” Base,
ungrateful, and cowardly slander! Let your me-

of 1782 ? England was prostrate; Ireland was, as
far as depended upon England, defenceless, as far
as depended upon herself, invincible ; there were

mount the Castle guard-eighty thousand men bris-

Oh, no! An acclaiming people cheered a loyal

Ireland to another. What was the case of the
year 1798? No one can forget that day. The
contagion of French principles which had spared
no part of Europe, and no part of this empire,
reached Ireland--the republican faction meditated
separation; the resident parliament investigated
the conspiracy, and armed the executive with
vigorous authority: in a few weeks forty thousand
men rose in arms at the call of British connexion.

While England has run the race of dominion, Ire-
land has run the race of connexion. I trust she
never may retrace her steps. Was separation
then in 1798 the tendency of the Irish gentry, and
is it for that that an Irish parliament cannot be
suffered to exist ? Was it for separation that the
dangers and fatigues of a military life were em-
braced and courted ? Was it for separation that
the merchant left his counting-house, and the
student his college, for the camp ? Was it for
separation that the youth of the university sprung
to arms with the ingenuous ardour of the young
heart, and that the spring-bud of the nation put
forth its tender and its eager head to brunt tho
storm? Oh, no! The country was saved because
there was a standard erected in it, round which
the Irish gentry loved to rally, and that standard
was British connexion.

Let me adjure the noble lord to weigh well,
and consider deeply, the probable permanency of
a measure so conducted ; let me implore him to
avail himself of the passing experience of his own
days, and of the instructions which history may
afford him; and when he sees volcanic revolutions
desolating the face of the political world, the
first elementary principles of society loosening
and dissolving, and empires not built upon the
liberties of the people, crumbling into dust; let
him contemplate the awful change which he is
about to accomplish, and consider the dreadful
responsibility he incurs to his sovereign, by ex-
changing the affections of a loyal nation for the
reluctant obedience of a degraded and defrauded
province. Let him look for the permanency of

him have some better document than his army
list for the affections of the people ; let him con-
sider whether posterity will validate this act, if
they believe that the constitution of their an-
cestors was plundered by force, or filched by

ponder, whether posterity will validate this act,
if they believe that the basest corruption and
artifice were exerted to promote it, that all the
worst passions of the human heart were enlisted in-
to the service, and all the most depraved ingenuity
of the human intellect tortured to devise new
contrivances of fraud. I do not say those things
have been-I state hypothetically, and ask, if
posterity believe such things, will they validate
the transaction ? If they believe that there was
foul play from the first moment to the last, both
within doors and without, that the rabble were
appealed to from the parliament, and debauched
or intimidated to petition against the constitution
of their country-if they believe that in parlia-.
ment the disgust of the measure, notwithstanding a
proscription which made office incompatible with
honour, stained the treasury-bench, that the dis-
gust of the measure broke asunder and dissociated
some of the dearest and most delicate connexions of
human life; that the nominal office of escheator of
Munster became an office of honourable competi-
tion; and after the parliament was thus reduced,
that the Irish commons were recruited from the
English staff ;-if they were to believe those
things, and that human frailty and human neces-
sities were so practised upon, that the private
sentiments and the public conduct of several
could not be reconciled, and that where the mi-
nister could influence twenty votes, he could not
command one “hear him!”—I say not that these
things are so, but I ask you, if posterity believe
them to have been so, will posterity validate this

do so.
I have too long troubled you, but before I sit
down, let me, for once, conjure this House to con-
sider whether this be a transaction altogether upon
which they are willing to commit themselves, their
properties, their characters, and their children. Let
me conjure them to weigb that question well, if
private honour and public virtue be not a name,
and if every generous feeling be not banished from
amongst us. Where is that spirit, which in the
year 1782 swelled the crest and glorified the
character of Irish gentry, which achieved liberty
for yourselves, and extorted justice from England,
and admiration from Europe? Is it fled and ex-
tinguished for ever?-I will not believe it. But
were every appeal to every thing human fruitless
and vain, I would invoke that Providence, which
even in my short life, bas so often stretched its
protecting arm over my country--in my short life
my country from a province has become a nation
-has been protected from a bloody rebellion and
a formidable invasion, and has seen one desperate
attempt against her liberties and constitution frus-
trated and overthrown. I will rely on God to
save Ireland.

of our confidence, to desire us to destroy our coun-
try; you have taken a most ungenerous and unjust
advantage of the state of that country, to induce its
parliament to annihilate itself, and the liberties of

baseness; we will show you, that we represent
an honest, brave, and generous people, and are

This, Sir, I will suppose to be the influence of

When this momentous question was last agi-

that period I have had time for reflection; I have
thought-I have read-I have deepened into that
important subject, and what was first the warm
and natural impulse of agitated feelings, has be-
come the result of calor investigation, and of de-
liberate judgment-I am of the same opinion still;
nor is there an inducement on this terrestrial
globe--a reward under that of heaven, which could
this night seduce me to betray my country. I
form that determination on genuine principles of
the most unshaken loyalty, and unequivocal at-
tachment to the benefits and the liberty of the
British constitution. And in acting on these
principles, I act as a supporter of the British
crown, and a friend of the British sceptre. For
I am confirmed in my opinion, that a revolutionary
nieasure, arising froin the ashes of a rebellion, and
grounded on the distractions of a nation, never
can be permanent. I know that the firm spirit of
1782 bas ebbed for a moment; but I also know,
that in every country under heaven, there is a re-
curring tide of public virtue, which though it may
sometimes recede, yet, like the billows of the
ocean, is certain to return, and difficult to resist.
I dread lest when that recurring tide shall wash
away the despondency and dissipate the terrors
of the Irish nation-when the deformity of depen-
dance shall appear naked before them, that the
event may become ultimately dangerous to the
most precious of all our political considerations,
namely, our imperial connexion with Great Britain;
a connexion, without which Ireland must tall, and
Great Britain would be no more. With this im-
pression engraven on my mind, and interwoven in
my understanding, I should be a bad subject and
a worse Irishman, did I give my guilty assent
to the perpetration of a measure so fatal to the
honour of the Irish nation, and the integrity of
the British empire.

IRELAND has now nothing to ask, and Great
Britain nothing to bestow, which could compen-
sate the advantage of independent constitution,
or the security of a resident legislature. Our con-
stitution is free-our trade is open-our manufac-
tures prosper--and our tranquillity is increasing.
-What do we want which we may not look to from
the hands of an Irish Senate? What favour have
we to beseech from the hands of a British parlia-
ment ?-None ;--internal peace, and internal se-
curity, will be best achieved amongst those who
are to taste its benefits, and best know the causes
of its real wants and internal discordance. When
I reflect on the means of restoring our internal
tranquillity, I find it attainable amongst our-
selves. The consideration of the question has
opened a new scene to my reason, and thrown a
new light upon my understanding. The heredi-
tary prejudices of my early life, and the acquired
bigotry of my late one, began to wear away ;-the
mist began to dissipate; and I beheld my native
country rising above. her faults, and triumphant
over her misfortunes, embracing All her children
+clasping her sister in the genuine embrace of
natural love and independent affection--and with
her rising, hand in hand, in double strength and
double prosperity, in separate persons, but with
united love and united interest, under the power
and protection of a common parent.

tion it is, that the noble lord is to be considered
as understanding the interests of this country
better than any other man.- Are men possessed of
the delusive opinion, that experience is not the
compass by which a statesman should steer ?-
or will they persuade themselves (as I am sure
he has persuaded himself) that there is a ray of
divine wisdom, a luminous intuition, given to
this young man, to remedy the natural deficiency
of youth, and to supply the experience of more
adult years? There is, indeed, a certain degree
of confidence due from the people to those who
are set in authority over them, but carried too
far, that confidence may be miserably fatal.- Are
the present ministry entitled to that confidence ?
-a ministry composed of men whose talents do
not rise above the regions of mediocrity-a minis-
try who would reject the assistance of any man
of real talents who would dare to assert the liber-
ty of bis country in the cabinet of the viceroy-a
ministry composed of the shreds and remnants of
every faction-a ministry whose public principles
admit as much variety as their personal features,
but who are alike however in their want of ability
and knowledge, in their devotion to corruption,
and in their hostility to the constitution. Such
is the ministry which has boldly avowed its de-
termination to persevere in a measure wbich is
the very summit and perfection of human wicked-
ness, to impose the yoke of slavery upon the neck
of a free people-not the slavery of conquest,
not the slavery of despotism-not the slavery of
aristocratic tyranny, or democratic frenzy, but the
worst of all slavery, the slavery of corruption.

Wears not a terror to appal the souls
Of constant men, but I have fronted it.

On bis scythed car, and when he fell, he fell
As one that honoured death, by nobly dying.

His fierce steed with the sudden grasp of death.

Presiding in the hall of ducal state,
Apparent sovereign of our hundred isles,
Robed in official purple, dealing out
The edicts of a power which is not mine,
Nor yours, but of our masters—the patricians.
Why I was there you know, or think you know;
Why I am here he who hath been most wronged,
He who among you hath been most insulted,
Outraged and trodden on, until he doubt
If he be worm or no, may answer for me,
Asking of his own heart what brought him here?
You know my recent story, all men know it,
And judge of it far differently from those
Who sate in judgment to heap scorn on scorn.
Our private wrongs have sprung from public vices
In tbis-I cannot call it commonwealth
Nor kingdom, which hath neither prince nor people,
But all the sins of the old Spartan state
Without its virtues-temperance and valour.
The lords of Lacedæmon were true soldiers,
But ours are Sybarites, while we are Helots, (5)
Of whom I am the lowest, most enslaved,
Although dressed out to head a pageant, as
The Greeks of yore made drunk their slaves to form
A pastime for their children. You are met
To overthrow this monster of a state,
This mockery of a government, this spectre,
Which must be exorcised with blood, and then
We will renew the times of truth and justice.
In operating this great change, I claim
To be one of you-if you trust in me;
If not, strike home,-my life is compromised,
And I would rather fall by freeman's hands
Than live another day to act the tyrant
As delegate of tyrants ; such I am not,
And never have been-read it in our annals ;
I can appeal to my past government
In many lands and cities; they can tell you
If I were an oppressor, or a man
Feeling and thinking for my fellow men.

A thing of robes and trinkets, dizen'd out
To sit in state as for a sovereign's picture;
A popular scourge, a ready sentence-signer,
A stickler for the Senate and " the Forty,"
A tool, a fool, a puppet,--they had ne'er
Foster'd the wretch who stung me. What I suffer
Has reached me through my pity for the people ;
That many know, and they who know not yet
Will one day learn ; meantime, I do devote
(Whate'er the issue) my last days of life-
My present power such as it is not that
Of Doge, but of a man who had been great
Before he was degraded to a Doge,
And still has individual means and mind;
I stake my fame (and I had fame)-my breath-

My beart-my hope-my all-upon this cast !
Such as I am, I offer me to you
And to your chiefs : accept me or reject me,
A Prince who fain would be a citizen
Or nothing, and who has left his throne to be so.

Some for escape, they live but to avenge
The fallen ? and how distinguish now the innocent
From out the guilty !-however,

Far better that we can, to whom alone
Their public vices and most foul oppression
Have made them deadly; if there be amongst them
One who deserves to be repeal'd, pronounce.

Fought by my side, and Marc Cornaro shared
My Genoese embassy ; I saved the life
Of Veniero-shall I save it twice ?
Would that I could save them and Venice also !
All these men, or their fathers, were my friends
Till they became my subjects; then fell from me
As faithless leaves drop from the o'erblown flower,
And left me a lone, blighted, thorny stalk,
Which in its solitude can shelter nothing ;
So, as they let me wither, let them perish!
Calendaro. They cannot co-exist with Venice'
freedom !
Doge. All these men were my friends; I loved
them, they
Requited honourably my regards;
We served and fought; we smiled and wept in

We revell’d or we sorrow'd side by side ;
We made alliances of blood and marriage;
We grew in years and honours fairly, till

And crush their blossoms into barrenness.

Remember what these men have dealt to you,
And that this sacrifice will be succeeded
By ages of prosperity and freedom
To this unshackled city. A true tyrant

SCENE 1.- Cataline's Palace.
CATALINE enters reading a Letter, and perturbed.
Cataline. FLUNG on my pillow! does the last
night's wine
Perplex me still? its words are wild and bold:
[Reads.] “Noble Cataline! where you tread,
the earth is hollow, though it gives no sound.
There is a storm gathering, though there are no
clouds in the sky. Rome is desperate; three
hundred patricians have sworn to do their duty;
and what three hundred have sworn, thirty thou-
sand will make good.”
Why, half the number now might sack the city,
With all its knights, before a spear could come
From Ostia to their succour.-"Twere a deed !
[Reads. ] “You have been betrayed by the
Senate, betrayed by the Consuls, and betrayed
by the people. You are a Roman, can you suffer
chains? You are a soldier, can you submit to
shame? You are a man; yet ruined, trampled on,
disdained.
[Flinging away the paper.
Disdained! they're in the right--It tells the truth-
I am a scoff and shame-a public prate.
There's one way left: [draws a poniard] this
dagger in my heart-
The quickest cure! But, 'tis the coward's cure ;--
And what shall heal the dearer part of me,
My reputation ? What shield's for my name,
When I shall fling it, like my corpse, to those
Who dared not touch it living, for their lives ?
So there his satisfaction ; and my veins
Must weep-for nothing! When my enemies
Might be compelled to buy them drop by drop.
No! by the Thunderer, they shall pay their price.

With ten-fold scorn; break up all leagues with her,
All memories. I will not breathe her air,

The rioters seized ; and now the rumour goes

But must be saved.

But its blood quench'd the altar. Romulus' wolf
Last night was struck by lightning. Thunderbolts
Have fallen on many temples. Heavy gore
Drops from Jove's statue in the Capitol.
Cataline. These wonders may be chance.
Hamilcar. Chance can do nothing. There's no
turn of earth;
No, not the blowing of the summer-wind,
Or the unstable sailing of a cloud,
Much more the destiny of mighty states,
But hath a will that orders it.
Cataline. Let time tell.
Your brain is always rich in fantasies;
Your birth has done it not the restless time,
The spirit of your fiery land of spells,
Is colouring the common things of life
Into mysterious splendour.
Hamilcar.
And I dream!
All Rome has seen the comet risen by Mars.
Cataline. The infidel!-Yet Heaven can show
strange things.
Last night I could not rest: the chamber's heat,
Or some wild thoughts--the folly of the day-
Banish'd my sleep :-so in the garden air,
I gazed upon the comet, that then shone
In midnight glory, dimming all the stars.
At once a crimson blaze, that made it pale,
Flooded the north. I turn’d, and saw in heaven
Two mighty armies! From the zenith star,
Down to the earth, legions in line and orb,
Squadron and square, like earthly marshalry.
Anon, as if a sudden trumpet spoke,
Banners of gold and purple were flung out;
Fire-crested leaders swept along the lines ;
And both the gorgeous depths, like meeting seas,
Roll'd to wild battle. Then they breathed awhile,
Leaving the space between a sheet of gore,
Strew'd with torn standards, corpses, and crashed
spears :
But soon upon the horizon's belt uprosè,

I pass’d an hour upon the battlements;

In zenith splendour. Right between their orbs,

Rang from the trumpets in the Capitol.

Enclosed a throne-but to be won by war !

For in my veins they saw the ancient blood
Of mighty necromancers, Afric's kings;
And took delight in showing me their spells,
Immortal essences, amalgams, seals,
Strong talismans, that keep the Egyptian's gold
Shrin'd in the pyramids; the Brahmin signs,
The mystic Ten, that measure ocean's sands,
The forest-leaves and stars; the arrowy words,
That guard the slumbers of the genii king,
Beneath Persepolis ;--all powers of gems!

Lead men to madness !-It was in your youth?

To know the chance that but an hour might bring.

From Massinger's Roman Actor.

Enter ARETINUS, FULCINIUS, RusticUS, SURA,
Senators : Paris, LATINUS, and Æsopus, Players.
Aretinus. CONSCRIPT Fathers, the purpose of
this frequent senate
Is, first, to give thanks to the gods of Rome,
Who, for the propagation of the empire,
Vouchsafe us one to govern it, like themselves.
In height of courage, depth of understanding,
And all those virtues, and remarkable graces,
Which make a prince most eminent, our Domitian
Transcends the ancient Romans : I can never
Bring his praise to a period. What good man,
That is a friend to truth, dares make it doubtful,
That he hath Fabius' staidness, and the courage
Of bold Marcellus, to whom Hannibal gave
The style of Target, and the Sword of Rome?
But he has more, and every touch more Roman ;
As Pompey's dignity, Augustus' state,
Antony's bounty, and great Julius' fortune,
With Cato's resolution. I am lost
In the ocean of his virtues : in a word,
All excellencies of good men meet in him,
But no part of their vices.
Rusticus. [aside] This is no flattery!
Sura. Take heed, you'll be observed.
Aritenus. 'Tis then most fit
That we, (who, as to the father of our country,
Like thankful sons, stand bound to pay true service
For all those blessings that he showers upon us,)
Should not connive, and see his government
Depraved and scandalized by meaner men,
That to his favour and indulgence owe
Theinselves and being.

In thee, as being the chief of thy profession,

As libellers against the state and Cæsar.
Paris. Mere accusations are not proofs, my lord;
In what are we delinquents ?
Aretinus. You are they
That search into the secrets of the time,
And, under feign'd names, on the stage presont
Actions not to be touch'd at; and traduce
Persons of rank and quality of both sexes,
And, with satirical, and bitter jests,
Make even the senators ridiculous
To the plebeians.
Paris. If I free pot myself,
And, in myself, the rest of my profession,
From these false imputations, and prove
That they make that a libel which the poet
Writ for a comedy, so acted too;
It is but justice that we undergo
The heaviest censure.
Aretinus. Are you on the stage,
You talk so boldly ?
Paris. The whole world being one,
This place is not exempted; and I am
So confident in the justice of our cause,
That I could wish Cæsar, in whose great name
All kings are comprehended, sat as judge,
To hear our plea, and then determine of us.
For if desire of honour was the base
On which the building of the Roman empire
Was raised up to this height; if, to inflame
The noble youth with an ambitious heat
T'endure the frosts of danger, pay, of death,
To be thought worthy the triumphal wreath
By glorious undertakings, may deserve
Reward, or favour from the commonwealth ;

Actors may put in for as large a share
As all the sects of the philosophers :
They with cold precepts (perhaps seldom read)
Deliver, what an honourable thing
The active virtue is : but does that fire
The blood, or swell the veins with emulation,
To be both good and great, equal to that
Which is presented on our theatres ?
Let a good actor, in a lofty scene,
Show great Alcides honour'd in the sweat
Of his twelve labours; or a bold Camillus,
Forbidding Rome to be redeem'd with gold
From the insulting Gauls; or Scipio,
After his victories, imposing tribute
On conquer'd Carthage : if done to the life,
As if they saw their dangers, and their glories,
And did partake with them in their rewards,
All that have any spark of Roman in them,
The slothful arts laid by, contend to be
Like those they see presented.
Rusticus. He has put
The consuls to their whisper.
Paris. But, 'tis urged,
That we corrupt youth, and traduce superiors.

By the success of wicked undertakings,
Others to tread in their forbidden steps ?
We show no arts of Lydian profligacy,
Corinthian poisons, Persian flatteries,
But mulcted so in the conclusion, that
Even those spectators that were so inclined,
Go home changed men. And, for traducing such
That are above us, publishing to the world
Their secret crimes, we are as innocent
As such as are born dumb. When we present
An heir, that does conspire against the life
Of his dear parent, numbering every hour

That, for a lasting memory of his name,
His deeds, bis real, nay, his royal worth,
You set up in your capitol in brass
My father's statue, there to stand for ever,
A monument and irophy of his victories,
With this inscription, to succeeding ages,
“ Great Cassilane, patron of Candy's peace,
Perpetual triumpher."

Antinous. No more.

To you and to the state, he branded now
With ignominy ne'er to be forgotten :
Rear mé no monument, unless you mean
To bave me famed a coward, and be stamp'd so.

Cassilane. Proud boy, thou dost,
And tyrant-like insult'st upon my shame.
Antinous. Sir, heaven can tell, and my integrity,
That what I did was only to enforce
The Senate's gratitude.
Cassilane. Observe it, fathers, how this haughty
boy
Grows cunning in his envy of my honours :
He knows no mention can of me be made,
But that it ever likewise must be told
How I by him was master'd; and for surety
That all succeeding times may so report it,
He would have my dishonour, and his triumphs,
Engraved in brass : Hence, bence proceeds tho
falsehood
Of his insinuating piety.
Thou art no child of mine; thee and thy blood,
Here in the Capitol, before the Senate,
I utterly renounce! So thrift and fate
Confirm me! Henceforth, never see my face;
Be, as thou art, a villain to thy father!

To the four scenes for the exhibition of Elocution, already enu-
merated, namely, the Bar, the Pulpit, the Senate, and the Stage, may
be added that of Popular Assemblies,
The Eloquence of Popular Assemblies, taken in a general sense,
might comprise the Eloquence of the Senate ; but, in a particular
sense, it implies that species of eloquence which is calculated for public
meetings of the People, when they assemble to debate upon matters
that are subject to their own control, or in which their interests or
passions are involved. Under this head may also be enumerated
Public Societies, formed for the discussion of subjects pertaining to Re-
ligion, Politics, Literature, Science, &c. &c.

1.- Exordium to an Address to the Electors of
Bristol. (1)
MR. MAYOR, and Gentlemen,-I am extremely
pleased at the appearance of this large and re-
spectable meeting. The steps I may be obliged
to take will want the sanction of a considerable
authority; and in explaining any thing which may
appear doubtful in my public conduct, I must
naturally desire a very full audience.
I have been backward to begin my canvass.-
The dissolution of the parliament was uncertain ;
and it did not' become me, by an unseasonable
importunity, to appear diffident of the fact of my
six years' endeavour to please you. I had served
the city of Bristol honourably; and the city of

Bristol had no reason to think, that the means of
honourable service to the public were become in-
different to me.
I found, on my arrival here, that three gentlemen
had been long in eager pursuit of an object, which
but two of us can obtain. I found that they had
all met with encouragement. A contested elec-
tion in such a city as this is no light thing. I
paused on the brink of the precipice. These three
gentlemen, by various merits, aậd on various
titles, I made no doubt were worthy of your fa-
vour. I shall never attempt to raise myself by
depreciating the merits of my competitors. In
the complexity and confusion of these cross pur-
suits, I wished to take the authentic public sense
of my friends upon a business of so much deli-
cacy. I wished to take your opinion along with
me; that if I should give up the contest at the
very beginning, my surrender of my post may not
seem the effect of inconstancy, or timidity, or
anger, or disgust, or indolence, or any other tem-
per unbecoming a man who has engaged in the
public service. If, on the contrary, I should un-
dertake the election, and fail of success, I was
full as anxious, that it should be manifest to the
whole world, that the peace of the city had not
been broken by my rashness, presumption, or
fond conceit of my own merit.
I am not come by a false and counterfeit show
of deference to your judgment, to seduce it in my
favour. I ask it seriously and unaffectedly. If
you wish that I should retire, I shall not consider
that advice as a censure upon my conduct, or an
alteration in your sentiments; but as a rational
submission to the circumstances of affairs. If,
on the contrary, you should think it proper for me
to proceed on my canvass, if you will risk the trou-
ble on your part, I will risk it on mine. My pre-
tensions are such as you cannot be ashamed of,
whether they succeed or fail.

If you call upon me, I shall solicit the favour
of the city upon manly ground. I come before
you with the plain confidence of an honest servant
in the equity of a candid and discerning master.
I come to claim your approbation, not to amuse
you with vain apologies, or with professions still
more vain and senseless. I have lived too long
to be served by apologies, or to stand in need of
them. The part I have acted has been in open
day, and to hold out a conduct, which stands in
that clear and steady light for all its good and all
its evil, to hold out to that conduct the paltry
winking tapers of excuses and promises, --I never,
will do it. They may obscure it with their smoke,
but they can never illumine sunshine by such a
flame as theirs.
I am sensible that no endeavours have been
left untried to injure me in your opinion. But
the use of character is to be a shield against ca.
lumny. I could wish undoubtedly, (if idle wishes
were not the most idle of all things,) to make every
part of my conduct agreeable to every one of my
constituents. But in so great a city, and so great-
Jy divided as this, it is weak to expect it.
In such a discordancy of sentiments, it is better
to look to the nature of things than to the humours
of men. The very attempt towards pleasing every
body, discovers a temper always flasby, and often
false and insincere. Therefore, as I have pro-
ceeded straight onward in my conduct, so I will
proceed in my account of those parts of it which
have been most excepted to. But I must first
beg leave just to hint to you, that we may suffer
very great detriment by being open to every talker.
It is not to be imagined how much of service is
lost from spirits full of activity, and full of energy,
who are pressing, who are rushing forward, to
great and capital objects, when you oblige them
to be continually looking back. Whilst they are
defending one service, they defraud you of a hun-

2.- Reasons for his not visiting the City of Bristol
at a particular Period : which apparent Neglect
offended many of the Electors.
To open my whole heart to you on this subject,
I do confess, however, that there were other times,
besides the two years in which I did visit you,
when I was not wholly without leisure for repeat-
ing that mark of my respect. But I could not
bring my mind to see you. You remember,
that in the beginning of this American war (that
era of calamity, disgrace, and downfal, an era
which no feeling mind will ever mention without
a tear for England) you were greatly divided ; and
a very strong body, if not the strongest, opposed
itself to the madness which every art and every
power were employed to render popular, in order
that the errors of the rulers might be lost in the
general blindness of the nation. This opposition
continued till after our great, but most unfortunate
victory at Long-Island. Then all the mounds and
banks of our constancy were borne down at once;
and the frenzy of the American war broke in
upon us like a deluge. This victory, which seemed
to put an immediate end to all difficulties, per-
fected us in that spirit of domination, which
our unparalleled prosperity had but too long nur-
tured. We had been so very powerful, and so
very prosperous, that even the humblest of us
were degraded into the vices and follies of kings.
We lost all measure between means and ends; and
our headlong desires became our politics and our
morals. All men who wished for peace, or re-
tained any sentiments of moderation, were over-
borne or silenced ; and this city was led by every
artifice (and probably with the more management,

because I was one of your members) to distin-
guish itself by its zeal for that fatal cause. IR
this temper of yours and of my mind, I should
have sooner fled to the extremities of the earth,
than have shown myself bere. I, who saw in
every American victory (for you have had a long
series of these misfortunes) the germ and seed of
the naval power of France and Spain, which all
our heat and warmth against America was only
hatching into life.-I should not bave been a wel-
come visitant with the brow and the language of
such feelings. When afterwards, the other face
of your calamity was turned upon you, and showed
itself in defeat and distress, I shunned you full
as much. I felt surely this variety in our wretch-
edness; and I did not wish to have the least
appearance of insulting you with that show of su-
periority, which, though it may not be assumed,
is generally suspected in a time of calamity, from
those whose previous warnings have been de-
spised. I could not bear to show you a represen-
tative whose face did not reflect that of his con-
stituents; a face that could not joy in your joys,
and sorrow in your sorrows. But time at length
has made us all of one opinion; and we have all
opened our eyes on the true nature of the Ameri-
can war, to the true nature of all its successes and
all its failures.
In that public storm too I had my private feel-
ings. I had seen blown down, and prostrate on the
ground, several of those bouses to whom I was chiefly
indebted for the honour this city has done me. I
confess that whilst the wounds of those I loved
were yet green, I could not bear to show myself
in pride and triumph in that place into which their
partiality had brought me; and to appear at feasts
and rejoicings, in the midst of the grief and cala-
mity of my warm friends, my zealous supporters,
my generous benefactors. This is a true, unyar-
nished, undisguised state of the affair. You will
judge of it.

3.-Panegyric on Mr. Howard. (2)
There was not, when Mr. Howard visited
Holland, more than one prisoner for debt in the
great city of Rotterdam. Although Lord Beau-
champ's act (which was previous to this bill, and
intended to feel the way for it) has already preserved
liberty to thousands; and though it is not three
years since the last act of grace passed, yet, by
Mr. Howard's last account, there were nearly three
thousand again in gaol. I cannot name this gen-
tleman without remarking, that his labours and
writings have done much to open the eyes and
hearts of mankind. He has visited all Europe, -
not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the
stateliness of temples; not to make accurate mea-
surements of the remains of ancient grandeur, nor to
form a scale of the curiosity of modern art; not to
collect medals, or to collate manuscripts ;--but to
dive into the depths of dungeons; to plunge into the
infection of hospitals; to survey the mansions of sor-
row and pain; to take the gage and dimensions of
misery, depression, and contempt; to remember the
forgotten, to attend to the neglected, to visit the
forsaken, and to compare and collate the distresses
of all men in all countries. His plan is original;
and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity. It
was a voyage of discovery; a circumnavigation of
charity. Already the benefit of his labour is felt
more or less in every country: I hope he will an-
ticipate his final reward, by seeing all its effects
fully realized in his own. He will receive, not
by retail, but in gross, the reward of those who
visit the prisoner; and he bas so forestalled and
monopolized this branch of charity, that there will
be, I trust, little room to merit by such acts of
benevolence hereafter.

4.-Peroration to the same Speech. (3)
GENTLEMEN, I have had my day. I can never
sufficiently express my gratitude to you for having
set me in a place, wherein I could lend the slightest
help to great and laudable designs. If I have had
my share in any measure giving security to private
property, and private conscience; if by my vote I
bave aided in securing to families the best possession
-peace ; if I have joined in reconciling kings to
their subjects, and subjects to their prince; if I
have assisted to loosen the foreign holdings of the
citizen, and taught him to look for his protection
to the laws of his own country, and for his com-
fort to the good will of his countrymen; if I have
thus taken my part with the best of men in the
best of their actions, I can shut the book, I might
wish to read a page or two more, but this is enough
for my measure-I have not lived in vain.
And now, gentlemen, on this serious day, when
I come, as it were, to make up my account with
you, let me take to myself some degree of honest
pride on the nature of the charges that are against
me. I do not here stand before you accused of
venality, or of neglect of duty. It is not said, that,
in the long period of my service, I have, in a single
instance, sacrificed the slightest of your interests
to my ambition, or to my fortune. It is not
alleged, that, to gratify any anger or revenge of my
own, or of my party, I have had a share in wrong-
ing or oppressing any description of men, or any
one man in any description. No! the charges
against me are all of one kind, that I have pushed
the principles of general justice and benevolence
too far ; further than a cautious policy would
warrant, and further than the opinions of many
would go along with me. In every accident which
may happen through life, in pain, in sorrow, in

Gentlemen, I submit the whole to your judg-

you have taken on this occasion. In your state
of health it is particularly obliging. If this com-
pany should think it advisable for me to withdraw,
I shall respectfully retire : if you think otherwise,
I shall go directly to the Council-house, and to

5.-Exordium to his Speech at the Crown and
Anchor Tavern, 18th September, 1806. (4)
GENTLEMEN-Electors of Westminster,-Upon
that subject which must fill all your minds -upon
the merits of that illustrious man, whose death
has occasioned the present meeting, I shall, I can
say but little. There must be some interval be-
tween the heavy blow that has been struck, and
the consideration of its effect, before any one (and
how many are there of those who have revered
and loved Mr. Fox as I bave done) can speak of
his death with the feeling, but manly composure,
which becomes the dignified regret it ought to in-
spire. To you, however, gentlemen, it cannot
be necessary to describe him, for you must have
known bim well. To say any thing to you at this
moment, in the first hours of your unboundened
sorrows, must be unnecessary, and almost insult-
ing. His image is still present before you-bis
virtue is in your hearts-his loss is your despair!
I have seen in one of the morning papers, what
are stated to have been the last words of this
great man,--"I die happy;" then turning to the
dearest object of his affection,-" I pity you !" But

had another moment been allowed him, and had
the modesty of his great mind permitted it, well
might he have expressed his compassion, not for
his private friends only, but for the world ;-
well might he have said, “I pity you! I pity Eng-
land! I pity Europe! I pity the human race!”-
For to mankind at large, his death must be a
source of regret, whose life was employed to pro-
mote their benefit. He died in the spirit of peace, ,
struggling to extend it to the world. Tranquil in
his own mind, he cherished to the last, with a
parental solicitude, the consoling hope to give
tranquillity to nations. Let us trust, that that
stroke of death, which has borne him from us,
may not have left peace and the dignified charities
of human nature, as it were, orphans upon the
world.
6.--Account of his Connexion with Mr. Fox.
HAVING thus avowed my ambition, or my pre-
sumption, as some have been heard to call it, I
have now to speak of my pretensions. Egotism is
always offensive; and I am happy that my learned
friend (5) has left me little or nothing to say on
this head. He has stated, and I avow and adopt
.his statement, that my claim to your favour rests
on the fact, that I have, step by step, followed
Mr. Fox through the whole course of his political
career; and, to the best of my poor abilities, sup-
ported him in every one of those measures, and in
the maintenance of every one of those principles,
which originally recommended him to, and so long
continued him in, your confidence and esteem.
It is true there have been occasions upon which
I have differed with him-painful recollection of
the most painful moments of my political life!
Nor were there wanting those who endeavoured
to represent those differences as a departure from

the homage, to which, though unclaimed by him,
his superior mind was entitled, and from the alle-
giance of friendship which our hearts all swore to
bim; but never was the genuine and confiding
texture of bis soul more manifest than on such
occasions. He knew that nothing on earth could
separate or detach me from him ; and he resented
insinuations against the sincerity and integrity of
a friend, which he would not have noticed had
they been pointed against bimself. With such a
man to have battled in the cause of genuine liberty
- with such a man to have struggled against the
inroads of oppression and corruption--with such
an example before me, to have to boast that I never
in my life gave one vote in parliament that was
not on the side of freedom, is the congratulation
that attends the retrospect of my public life. His
friendship was the pride and honour of my days.
I never, for one moment, regretted to share with him
the difficulties, the calumnies, and sometimes even
the dangers, that attended an honourable course.
And now reviewing my past political life, were the
option possible, that I should re-tread the path,
I solemnly and deliberately declare, that I would
prefer to pursue the same course—to bear up
under the same pressure-to abide by the same
principles, and remain by his side, an exile from
power, distinction, and emolument, rather than
be, at this moment, a splendid example of suc-
cessful servility, or prosperous apostacy,--though
clothed with powers, honours, titles, and gorged
with sinecures and wealth obtained from the
plunder of the people.

with reluctance you will receive it. I feel myself
under the necessity of retiring from this contest.
[Here Mr. Sheridan was for some minutes inter-
rupted by loud cries of No-No-No.] I beseech
you to hear me with patience, and in the temper
with which I address you. There is in true friend-
ship this advantage: the inferior mind looks to the
presiding intellect as its guide and landmark while
living, and to the engraven memory of its princi-
ples, as a rule of conduct after its death. Yet
further, still unmixed with idle superstition, there
may be gained a salutary lesson from comtem-
plating what would be grateful to the mind of the
departed, were he conscious of what is passing
here. I solemnly believe, tbat could such a con-
sideration have entered into Mr. Fox's last mo-
ments, there is nothing his wasted spirits would
so have deprecated, as a contest of the natare
which I now disclaim and relinquish. It was never
ascertained to me until Monday last, after this meet-
ing bad been fixed, that Lord Percy would certainly
be a candidate. My friends hesitated in the hope,
that it might be left to arbitration which candi-
date should withdraw. That hope has failed. I
claim the privilege of nearest and dearest friend-
ship to set the example of a sacrifice--compara-
tively how small to what it demands ! Nothing
could ever have induced me to proceed to a disputed
poll on this occasion.--The hour is not far dis-
tant when an awful knell shall tell you that the
unburied remains of your revered patriot are pas-
sing through the streets to that sepulchral home,
where your kings-your heroes—your sages-and
your poets lie, and where they are to be honoured
by the association of his noble remains; that hour,

pageantry may be avoided, you-you-all of you

MR. BUSHE.
8.-Panegyric on Oratory ;-from his Address to
the Historical Society of the University of Dublin,
on the 24th June, 1794. (6)
There are men who have even put it to issue
whether oratory has been useful to mankind, and
have reasoned eloquently against eloquence : in
what department of life, then, lies the danger of
this fascinating destruction ? Did St. Paul mis-
take the spirit of Christianity when he spake with
the tongues of angels and of men? Has religion,
has charity, suffered by the eloquence of Kirwan ?
That great man revived, if he did not create, pul-
pit eloquence.—The dulness of mankind had con-
spired with their vices to fetter the pulpit in the
shackles of inexertion. The smallest attempt at
composition was spurned at as conceited; any
attempt at oratory derided as theatrical; stupi-
dity became orthodoxy, and genius reluctantly bri-
dled itself at the peril of beresy :—but the mighty
powers of that man, and a few more, broke
down the despotism of prejudice: and what was
the consequence !-churches overflowed, religion
disdained not the aid of talents-with a holy in-
dignation he smote the haughty ones of the earth,
and denounced them before their God. Pride,
like Felix, trembled before him : his eloquence,
at once pathetic and commanding, opened all the

sources of compassion, and forced all the fortres-
ses of vice-flinty avarice, callous profligacy, sel-
fish ambition, saucy presumption, all melted be-
fore him ; their tears and their alms flowed plen-
teously; captivity was released, the fatherless and
orphan were adopted, the widow's heart sung for
joy. Nor did it end here, the example was infec-
tious, a sanctified emulation ran through the pro-
ſession; universal exertion took place, and uni-
versal benevolence has followed it, and public
charity has become the characteristic of this coun-
try. Bring me, then, the muddy-headed and cold-
hearted divine who tells you that oratory is anti-
collegiate and anti-clerical, and I will tell him that
he is unfit for his high calling, because his soul
warms not his intellect in the discharge of it. He
will never do that good to others which is the es-
sence of his duty ;-he may serve out dull homi-
lies with the pblegm of a Dutchman and the graces
of an automaton ;-he may laboriously entangle
the simple beauties of the gospel in the embar-
rassing mazes of a learned controversy, and pro-
fane its mysteries by presumptuous explication;-
he may make the prophecies a riddle-book, and
the revelations a conundrum, and think himself,
like Edipus, entitled, in virtue of his blindness,
to solve the enigma : but he is not the sanguine,
the zealous, the efficient, that officer of the Al-
mighty that is to turn many to righteousness, and
whose reward is promised to be, that he shall shine
like the stars for ever and ever.
Bar eloquence, I hear, is also cried down; to
study it is anti-collegiate, to practise it is anti-
professional; good English induces suspicion of
shallowness, but oratory is prima facie evidence
of ignorance: the black letter and the belles lettres
are uncongenial; ornament is misdemeanour, and
eloquence high treason. Such is the vile and
senseless cant that assails the most liberal pro-
fessions, and labours to illiberalize and degrade

them. Such an opinion is the offspring of a vul-
gar and techninal mind-
“ Whose genius never soared beyond
The narrow rules of art his youth had conned;
And to long practice obstinately warm,
Suspects conviction, and relies on form.”
Such a man deprecates the genius which he does
not possess, and over-rates the handicraft he is
equal to: he would shear a splendid profession
of its beams, and cut it down to trade : but such
a man has mistaken bis trade;-- let him article him-
self to an attorney, or confine himself to special
pleading, and at his desk range through the va-
riety of forensic intricacy; on that foundation let
him build bis trade, and enjoy it too, “any thing
herein contained to the contrary thereof, in any
wise, notwithstanding."
But I will not believe that the profession I pre-
ferred, because I thought it the most liberal, is
such a low mechanic craft as this. I will not give
up the Burghs, and the Erskines, and the Currans
of the profession, to those fair jurisprudents and
learned applicants of the law, who scorn the ge-
nius that scorns them. The orations of such inen
will live while the language does, when the skulls
and the parchments of the others shall have moul-
dered together, and the saucy grave-digger, and
saucier critic, will say, “ This might have been
the head of a lawyer;-where now be your quips
and your quiddities !--is that the fine of your fines,
and the recovery of your recoveries ?” The ora-
tions of Cicero are young at this day, almost in
their two thousandth year. Pedius Corvinus atque
Poplicola, who were, I suppose, the black letter
men of their days, qui exsudavere causas latine, are
only known or preserved by a line in a poem,
which, perhaps, their gravity would have despised.

would be to such men as narrow a science as law,

they would feel much fastidiousness, but little in-
spiration.
When the British Senate wrung with the elo-

for the redress of the distant millions of Africa and
Hindostan, then England, building a new charac-

the spoils of a sordid commerce, or the trophies
of a destructive conquest, rose over the admiring
world the arbitress of justice—the emporium of
humanity. What would the enemy of eloquence

feel, when Grattan, asserting the independence of
a nation, and adjusting the unbalanced liberties
of an empire, with the magic of his fire-touched
tongue, terrifies one country into justice, and in-
spirits another into freedom; -when the awfulness
of his virtues, rushing majestic, and overbearing
upon the wings of his genius, impresses and con-
trols,--and the flashes of his mind, like the light-
nings of heaven, rapid and luminous, dazzle and
astonish ?

ELOCUTION OF THE BAR.
(1)
M.JEAN PELTIER was a French royalist, who, having
fled from his country at the commencement of the revolu-
tion, took refuge in England; where he devoted himself to
the publication of various works, which amounted altogether
to little less than fourscore volumes, all tending to expose
the anti-monarchical parties of France. During the short
peace of 1803, he published a work called “ The Ambigú,
or atrocious and amusing Varieties.” The first number
of this work contained an ode, which, undoubtedly, was
written with the view of exciting the people of France to
the assassination of Napoleon Buonaparte, then first Con-
sul of that country. Our government, being in temporary
amity with the French Republic, directed His Majesty's
Attorney General to file an information against M. Pel-
tier for the libel. This proceeding was instituted in order
to convince the French government that every thing
would be done, which was consistent with our laws, to
preclude all reasonable cause of complaint against the
license of our press. The defence was conducted by
Mr. Mackintosh, and the court was crowded to excess.
His speech has been pronounced to be a most splendid
and noble specimen of forensic eloquence. But, notwith-
standing his exertions, M. Peltier was found guilty.
However, war between Great Britain and France having
been renewed soon after the trial, he was never called
upon to receive judgment.

John Vint, the printer; George Ross, the publisher;
and John Parry, the proprietor, of the Courier news-
paper, were prosecuted in the year 1799, for a libel on
Paul I., Emperor of Russia. They were defended by
the Honourable Thomas Erskine, (afterwards Lord Chan-
cellor Erskine,) whose speech on that occasion seems to
me to have been a very powerful one, although it is not
taken notice of in the printed edition of his speeches. The
defendants were found guilty, and subjected to judgment;
the proprietor to fine and imprisonment; the printer and
the publisher to imprisonment only.

He alludes to the celebrated convention which took
place originally at Pilnetz, in Saxony, towards the close
of the summer of 1791, between Leopold, Emperor of
Germany, and the King of Prussia, between whom, as
principals, a treaty was formed, to which other powers
are supposed to have afterwards acceded. The professed
object of this treaty was the hostile invasion of France,
and the new modelling of its government. War ensued,
acd England soon became involved in the contest.

In consequence of the confederacy mentioned in the
foregoing note, the combined armies of Austria and
Prussia entered France. But the French general, Du-
mourier, having taken possession of the forest of Argonne,
defended the pass of Biesme, which was the Thermopylæ
of France, and thereby prevented the Duke of Brunswick,
who commanded the allied army, from penetrating by the
nearest route to Paris. The delay was destructive to the
allied army, and the Duke of Brunswick, in consequence,
proposed an armistice, and desired a conference with the
French general. The result was the retreat of the Prus-
sians, who were soon afterwards followed by the armies
of Austria and Hesse Cassel.

When the Commons of Great Britain ordered the im-
peachment against Warren Hastings, Esq. (see vote 1
to the Elocution of the Senate] the articles were prepared
by Mr. Edmund Burke, who had the lead in all the in-
quiries which led to it; and, instead of being drawn up
in the usual dry method of legal accusation, they were
expanded into great length, and were characterized by
that fervid and affecting language, which distinguishes all
the writings of that extraordinary person. The articles
so prepared, instead of being contined to the Records of
the House of Commons, until they were carried up to the
Lords for trial, were printed and sold in every shop in the
kingdom, without question or obstruction by the managers
of the impeachment, or the House of Commons; and,
undoubtedly, from the style and manner of their compo-
sition, they made a very considerable impression against
the accused.
To repel the effects of these articles, the Rev. Mr. Lo-
gan, one of the ministers of Leith, in Scotland, a person
eminent for learning, drew up a review of the articles of
impeachment, and carried it to Mr. Stockdale, an eminent
and respectable bookseller in Piccadilly, who published
it in the usual course of his business. Mr. Logan's Re-
view was composed with great accuracy and judgment,
but undoubtedly with strong severity of observation
against the accusation of Mr. Hastings; and having an
immediate and very extensive sale, it was complained of
by Mr. Fox to the House of Commons; and upon the
motion of that great and eminent person, then one of the
managers of the impeachment, the house unanimously
voted an address to the king, praying His Majesty to
direct his Attorney General to file an information against
Mr. Stockdale, as the publisher of a libel against the
Commons House of Parliament: which was filed ac-
cordingly.
The defence was conducted by the Honourable Thomas
Erskine ;-and of this defence the Edinburgh Review,

speaks thus :-" The fact of publication was admitted;
and Mr. Erskine then delivered one of the finest of all
his orations, whether we regard the wonderful skill with
which the argument is conducted, the soundness of the
principles laid down, and their happy application to the
case, or the exquisite fancy with which they are embel-
lished and illustrated,--and the powerful and touching
language in which they are conveyed. It is justly re-
garded by all English lawyers, as a consummate speci-
men of the art of addressing a jury ;--as a standard, a
sort of precedent for treating cases of libel, by keeping
which in his eye, a marr may hope to succeed in special
pleading his client's case within its principle, who is desti-
tute of the talent required even to comprehend the other
and higher merits of his original. By those merits it is
recommended to the lovers of pure diction, -of copious
and animated description,-of lively, picturesque, and
fanciful illustration,--of all that constitutes, if we may so
speak, the poetry of eloquence,--all for which we admire
it, when prevented from enjoying its music and its sta-
tuary.”. Of the passage to which this note belongs, the
same Review adds, " We give this wonderful passage
entire,--premising that the traditional accounts of its
effects are to be credited, not even by those who now
read it,--if they have not also experienced the witchery
of this extraordinary man's voice, eye, and action."

A person of the name of Orr had been found guilty
at the Carrickfergus Assizes, of administering unlawful
oaths. But before sentence of death had been passed
upon him, two of the jurors made an affidavit, stating,
that on the night of the trial, a considerable quantity of
spirituous liquors was conveyed into the jury-room, and
drunk by the jury, many of whom were greatly intoxicated,
and threatened the two jurors, who made the affidavit,
and who admitted that they also were in a state of intoxi-
cation, to prosecute them as United Irishmen, if they did
not concur in a verdict of guilty ; and that at length, wora

out by fatigue and drink, and subdued by menaces, they
did, contrary to their judgment, concur in that verdict.
Sentence of death was, nevertheless, pronounced upon
Mr. Orr; and, after being thrice respited, he suffered the
penalty of the law.
A newspaper published at Dublin in the years 1797
and 1798, under the title of the “ Press," operated,
during its short existence, very powerfully upon the
minds of the people. The conviction and execution of
Mr. Orr, was a topic continually brought forward, and
animadverted upon by Mr. Peter Finnerty, who declared
himself to be the sole proprietor, printer, and publisher, of
this publication. A letter signed Marcus, contained in
it, gave rise to a prosecution for a libel, and Mr. Fin-
nerty was accordingly put upon his trial on the 22nd of
December, 1797. He was defended by Mr. Curran;
but, notwithstanding the strong exertions of his advocate,
he was found guilty, and sentenced to stand in the
pillory.

This gentleman was prosecuted on an Ex-officio In-
formation filed against him by the Attorney General of
Ireland, for publishing what was charged to be a sedi-

found guilty, and sentenced to fine and imprisonment.
In order to illustrate the commencement of this exor-
dium, which has been thought to resemble that of Cicero
in defence of Milo, it is necessary to remark, that a few
moments before Mr. Curran rose, a guard of soldiers
was brought iuto the court-house by the sheriff.

ELOCUTION OF THE PULPIT.

The sermon from which this extract is taken, was
preached on the 20th of October, 1803, in the episcopal
chapel, Cowgate, Edinburgh, by the Rev. Archibald
Alison, senior minister of that chapel. At that period
the expectation of invasion from France was universal ;
the volunteer corps were every where forming in the
national defence; and on this day they attended the na-
tional churches by order of
government.

The general thanksgiving was appointed for the suc
cess of the allies against Napoleon Buonaparté. Of the
sermon of which this extract is an epitome, the Edinburgh
Review speaks thus : .“ We shall conclude our extracts
with some passages from the Thanksgiving Sermon of the
present year;-a nobler song of triumph-a more beau-
tiful and thrilling strain of patriotic exultation and Chris-
tian gratitude, than verse or prose has yet consecrated to
the memory of those great events which have stamped
this year as an era for the future history of the world.”

ELOCUTION OF THE SENATE.
(1)
WARREN HASTINGS, Esq. had been for nearly
thirty-two years in the service of the East India Com-
pany, during eleven of which he was Governor-General
of Bengal. His government forms the most brilliant
epoch of the British military history in India. In the
month of June, 1785, he returned to England, and the
following year was impeached of high crimes and misde-
meanors. The charges were founded on the harsh, and
often cruel, measures which imperious necessity compelled
him to take for the preservation of the British possessions
in India. His trial took place before the High Court
of Parliament in Westminster-hall, and it lasted from
Feb. 13, 1788, until his acquittal, April 23, 1795.
Mr. Burke was the leading manager of the prosecution ;
and on the 15th of February, 1788, he opened the articles
of impeachment by a speech which lasted four days, and
from which the extract, to which this note belongs, is
taken,
“ His speeches on this occasion," says one of his
biographers, “ were among the most splendid triumphs
of his eloquence, though not among the most solid attes-
tations of his judgment. They were marked by intem-
perance and exaggeration, apparently produced rather by
the ambition of rivalling Tully in his eloquent and classi-
cal abuse, than arising from a sober examination of facts,
or a serious conviction of guilt.”
I have quoted the above passage lest the young stu-
dent might be led to suppose that Mr. Hastings was that
monster which the brilliant and affecting language of his
accusers stated him to be..

Arcot's debts. An account of that subject is not neces-
sary to the elucidation of this extract; but it is necessary
to acquaint the student, that Hyder Ali was one of the most
formidable opponents that the East India Company ever
had to deal with. He was a soldier of fortune in the
East, and is said to have acquired the rudiments of war
in the French camps. Having been appointed to the
command of the Mysore army, he dethroned bis sovereign,
and governed the kingdom under the title of regent.
Soon after, he extended his dominions on every side, the
Carnatic excepted. But in the autumn of 1780, Hyder
Ali, being at war with England, and expecting a commu-
nion of interests with the French, broke into the Carnatic
with 100,000 troops, foot and horse, the best of their
kind that had ever been disciplined by a native of India.
This formidable irruption occasioned a despair of the
British interests in India, in the opinion of most people
of Europe. But Mr. Hastings sent a brigade of about
7000 men, with ample supplies of money and provisions,
to the relief of the Carnatic; and Hyder was success-
fully combated during two campaigns; at the end of which
(October, 1782) he appeared to be sincerely desirous of
peace. With this disposition of mind he died soon after,
in 1783, and was succeeded by his son, Tippoo, who
made peace with the English in March, 1784.

The district of Benares was granted by the Vizier

twenty-two lacks yearly. On the decease of Bullwant
Sing, in the year 1770, the grant was renewed to his son,

Cheyt Sing, on the same terms. In the year 1775, the
sovereignty which the Vizier A soph ul Dowlah, the son
and successor of Sujah Dowlah, possessed over the
Rajah and bis territory, was transferred to the Company.
In June, 1778, Mr. Hastings made a demand on the
Rajah of an additional supply of five lacks of rupees, or
£50,000. Cheyt Sing not only paid this demand to the
last shilling, but advanced the same sum on a similar re-
quisition in 1779 and 1780, the two succeeding years.
Another demand, however, was made by Mr. Hastings
upon Cheyt Sing, namely, that he should furnish 2000
cavalry at his own expense. On the Rajah's stating the
impossibility of his complying with this requisition, it was
moderated to 1000. Cheyt Sing still declared that he
had but 1300, 500 of which he offered to furnish, and to
supply the deficiency with 500 match-lock men, to be
also at his expense. For this non-compliance with the
orders of the Company, Mr. Hastings demanded from
the Rajah a fine of fifty lacks, or £500,000. And, having
proceeded himself to Benares to enforce the requisition,
he placed Cheyt Sing under an arrest. The rescue of
the Rajah, and the massacre of both the Europeans and
Gentoos, were the consequences of this proceeding.
(7)
MR. SHERIDAN was one of the managers of the im-
peachment.
On the 8th of June, 1788, he summed up the evidence
on the second, or Begum Charge. Since the commence-
ment of the trial, Westminster-ball had not seen so nu-
merous' or so brilliant an assemblage of persons as
crowded every part of it on that day. So great was the
anxiety to hear Mr. Sheridan, that by eight o'clock in the
morning the avenues leading to the hall, through new and
old Palace Yards, were filled with ladies and gentlemen of
the most respectable appearance, many of them peeresses,
in full dress, who stood in the streets for upwards of an
hour before the gates were opened.
The Begums were the princesses of Oude, the mother
and grandmother of the reigning Nabob, Asoph ul Dow-
lah. They were legally in possession of great estates,
both real and personal, the property of which was legally
vested in their hands, and guaranteed by the East India

Company. Mr. Hastings was accused of having invaded
this property, and of having compelled the Nabob to
spoil them of it; of having allowed the princesses and
their families to be treated with the greatest indignity,
and reduced to the greatest distress ; and of having slan-
dered them as the abettors of the rebellion of Cheyt Sing,
&c.

MR. BURKE,

The revolt was owing to the extortion and oppression
practised by the Company's officers resident in that pro-
vince.

THERE is a passage similar to_this in the play of
Pizarro, written by Mr. Sheridan. Rolla, when soliciting
Pizarro to restore Cora's 'child, says: " If thou dost harm
that child, think not his blood will sink into the barren
sand. No! faithful to the eager hope that now trembles
in this indignant heart, 'twill rise to the common God of
nature and humanity, and cry aloud for vengeance on its
accursed destroyer's head!”
The next paragraph also contains a passage parallel to
another in the same play. Rolla, addressing the Peru-
vian army, says: “They offer us their protection; yes,
such protection as vultures give to lambs-covering and
devouring them!”

The Jaghires were the appanages belonging to the
princesses of Oude. . Mr. Hastings was accused of
having compelled the Nabob to despoil the princesses of
these possessions.

The oration from which these extracts have been taken,
is said to have had a wonderful effect in Westminster-hall.
According to Mr. Burke, nothing of the ancients ever
came up to the eloquence of Mr. Sheridan. On their
return from the Hall to the House of Commons, the for-
mer thus took occasion to panegyrize the merits of his
friend :-" He has this day surprised the thousands who
hung with rapture on his accents, by such an array of

talents, such an exhibition of capacity, such a display of
powers, as are unparalleled in the annals of oratory; a
display that reflected the highest honour upon himself,
lustre upon letters, renown upon parliament, and glory
upon the country. Of all species of rhetoric, of every
kind of eloquence, that has been witnessed or recorded,
either in ancient or modern times; whatever the acuteness
of the bar, the dignity of the senate, the solidity of the
judgment-seat, and the sacred morality of the pulpit,
have hitherto furnished, nothing has surpassed, nothing
has equalled what we have heard this day in West-
minster-hall. No holy seer of religion, no sage, no
statesman, no orator, no man of any description what-
ever, has come up, in any one instance, to the pure sen-
timents of morality; or, in the other, to that variety of
knowledge, force of imagination, propriety and vivacity
of allusion, beauty and elegance of diction, strength and
copiousness of style, pathos and sublimity of conception,
to which we have this day listened with ardour and admi-
ration. From poetry up to eloquence there is not a
species of composition of which a complete and perfect
specimen might not from that single speech be culled
and selected.”-I have somewhere heard that the late
Queen Charlotte, wife to George III., complimented
Mrs. Brinsley Sheridan upon her good fortune in being
wedded to a man whom all the men in England envied,
and all the women admired.
(13)
It has been said that Mr. Sheridan, being in company
a few nights previous to his delivering this speech, was
observed by a lady to be in a thoughtful mood. Being
rallied on his want of vivacity, he pleaded as his excuse,
that he was thinking how he should close this speech.
“Oh!” replied his fair companion, “say, My lords, I
have done!”

On the 22nd of January, 1799, the question of Union
was regularly brought before the parliament of Ireland
by the Marquis Cornwallis, the Lord Lieutenant, who
alluded to it in his speech from the throne. The address
which was moved by the Earl of Tyrone seemed to favour
the views of administration. An amendment was accord-

ingly moved by Mr. George Ponsonby, an eminent bar-
rister, who afterwards tilled the high office of Lord Chan-
cellor of Ireland, during the lieutenancy of the Duke of
-Bedford, and on retiring from it, became leader of the
opposition in the British Parliament. This amendment
was supported by Sir John Parnell and Mr. J. Fitzgerald,
who had been just removed from the offices of Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer and Prime Serjeant, because
they were hostile to the measure; by Mr. Foster, the
speaker, and his friends; by Mr. Plunket, now Attorney
General for Ireland; and many others distinguished for
their talents or their influence in the country. Mr. Plun-
ket in express terms denied the competency of Parlia-
ment. (See p. 225.) After seventy-three members had
given their opinion for or against the amendment, a divi-
sion took place, and it was lost by a majority of one only.
Encouraged by such a close division, the opposition used
greater exertions; and when, two days after, the amend-
ment was again moved on the report of the address, it
was carried by a hundred and nine to a hundred and
four. This prevented the farther direct discussion of the
question during that session, the minister declaring it
should not be again brought forward until its introduction
should be justified by public sentiment.
During the summer of 1799 the Lord Lieutenant visited
many parts of Ireland, with a view to conciliate jarring
interests, and was received with great marks of respect.
Addresses were presented to him by public bodies
wherever he directed his course, most of which expressed
or implied approbation of a Union; and the newspapers,
were crowded with declarations in favour of that measure,
signed by the principal landed proprietors. In the mean-
time, the secretary, Lord Castlereagh, (the late Marquis
of Londonderry,) was not idle; several who had been.
adverse to the Union were induced to change their opinion,
or to resign their seats; and it was generally supposed
that the minister would not be again in a minority. At
the same time no exertions were spared by the opposers
of the measure: seats were vacated to bring in active
combatants; money was said to be subscribed to pur-
chase boroughs; and various other means were resorted
to. Forty-eight members were brought in by one side or
the other, in place of gentlemen who retired, and eight or

nine were. re-elected, on being appointed to lucrative
places under the crown.
On the 15th of Jan., 1800, the Lord Lieutenant opened
the session by a speech from the throne, in which no men-
tion was made of the Union, and of course it was unno-
ticed in the address proposed by the friends of adminis-
tration ; but Sir Laurence Parsons (afterwards Lord Rosse)
having required the speech of the Lord Lieutenant at the
close of the last session, in which he had noticed the pro-
ceedings of the British Parliament, to be read, moved, as
an amendment to the address,“ Humbly to assure His
Majesty that this kingdom is inseparably united with Great
Britain, and that it is the sentiment, wish, and real interest
of all His Majesty's subjects, that it ever shall continue
so united in the full enjoyment of the blessings of a tree
constitution, in the support of the honour and dignity of
His Majesty's crown, and in the preservation and ad-
vancement of the welfare and prosperity of the whole
empire; which blessings of a free constitution we owe to
the spirited assertion of this kingdom of its birth-right to
a free and independent Parliament resident within it, and
to the parental kindness of your Majesty, and the libera-
lity of the British Parliament, ratifying the same in the
year 1782, and which we have at all times felt, and do
now particularly feel it our bounden duty to maintain.”
Ninety-six members voted for this amendment, and
one hundred and thirty-eight against it, so that the minis-
ter had a majority of forty-two, on that question, on
which, in the preceding session, there was a majority of
five against him.
On this interesting occasion, the great abilities of Mr.
Grattan, which had been voluntarily cast into obscurity,
by his retiring from parliament, were once more brought
before the public. The reporters who have transmitted
the account of this night's debate, state: “Never was
beheld a scene more solemn; an indescribable emotion
seized the house and gallery, and every heart heaved in
tributary pulsation to the name, the virtues, and the re-
turn to parliament of the founder of the constitution of
1782; the existence of which was then the subject of
debate."
As the discussion of this question proceeded, the mem-
bers of the opposition appeared to diminish, and on the
2nd of April, the resolutions, as they had finally passed

the Irish Parliament, were laid before the British House,
in which, though there were several spirited debates, the
measure was carried by a great majority. In the Lords,
the principle was carried by eighty-two to three, and the
final division was seventy-five for, and seven against. In
the Commons a motion of Mr. Grey's for an address to
His Majesty, " That he would be graciously pleased to
suspend all proceedings on the Irish Union till the senti-
ments of the Irish people respecting that measure could
be ascertained,” was rejected by two hundred and
thirty-six to thirty. The bill founded on these resolutions
received the royal assent in England on the 2nd of July,
and in Ireland on the 1st of August, when the Lord
Lieutenant, on proroguing Parliament, congratulated it
on the accomplishment of this great work.

It is evident from the context that he still alludes to
the American war.

The British Parliament is held in the chapel of St.
Stephen. The orator metaphorically calls it “ The Mar-

(18)
IN 1788 it pleased God to afflict our late good and
beloved king with a malady which disabled him from ex-
ercising his royal functions. The Parliament of Great.
Britain determined, after long deliberations, to appoint
the Prince of Wales Regent, with restrictions. Whilst
their deliberations depended, the Parliament of Ireland
met, and on the 11th of February, 1789, they resolved
that an address should be presented to the Prince, re-
questing him to take upon himself the government during
His Majesty's indisposition, under the style and title of
Prince Regent of Ireland.
The debate which took place on this question is
one of the most interesting and important in the annals

--the natural regent of independent Ireland. Mr. Pitt
and the Parliament of England conceived that they best
preserved the rights of their sovereign, and the rights of
the people, by limiting and circumscribing the powers of
the Regent; they therefore proceeded by bill, to grant to
the Prince of Wales such authorities and powers as they
pleased to prescribe; they preferred a proceeding which
obliged them to have recourse to the great seal to legalize
their act. Ireland proceeded otherwise. She sincerely
lamented the incapacity of her sovereign, but embraced
the honour and integrity of his son. The course therefore
recommended by Mr. Grattan was, by an address, pro-
viding for the contingency of their monarch's restoration.
This was opposed by all the talents and influence the
niinisters could muster, and especially by the Attorney
General, Mr. Fitzgibbon, afterwards Lord Clare. The
question, however, was carried, without a division. The
the
dress was agreed to, and on the 19th both houses waited
upon the Lord Lieutenant, and requested him to transmit
it to His Royal Highness. With this request bis Ex-
cellency refused to comply, and, accordingly, commis-
sioners from the Lords and Commons were immediately
appointed to present it to His Royal Highness. His
Grace the Duke of Leinster and the Earl of Charlemont
were appointed on the part of the Lords, and the Right
Honourable Thomas Connolly, the Right Honourable
John O'Neill, the Right Honourable W. B. Ponsonby,
and J. Stewart, Esq., on that of the Commons. They
arrived in London on the 25th of February, 1789, and the
day following presented their address to the Prince of
Wales, at Carlton-house. The convalescence of the king
prevented further proceedings, but the conduct of the
Irish Parliament supplied the advocates of Union with a
powerful argument; and if Mr. Pitt had been undecided
before, this probably determined him to take the first
opportunity of carrying it into effect.

ELOCUTION OF THE STAGE.
(1)
WHEN the Romans sat down before the walls of Jeru:
Salem, the besieged were divided into three factions; the
leaders of which were Simon, John, and Eleazar. John
having surprised Eleazar, who occupied the temple,
during a festival, their parties were united into one. The
civil contest was then carried on between Johin and Simon,
The latter is represented as an enthusiast.

Titus crucified round the city those who fled from
the famine, and the cruelty of the leaders within. Some-
times, according to Josephus, five hundred in a day suf-
fered.

the city was in the hands of the conqueror, search was
made for Josephus, who had escaped the general mas-
sacre, by concealing himself in a cavern cut in a rock.
In this gloomy recess he met with forty men of eminence,
who had concealed themselves, and had with them pro-
visions sufficient for their support for several days. Upon
their being discovered he proposed to his companions that
they should all surrender; and upon their determination
rather to perish by mutual wounds, he persuaded them to
casts lots successively, to decide who should kill the next
By an extraordinary circumstance he and one
other were left the survivors of the rest. This single com-
panion was easily prevailed upon to join him in accepting
the proffered mercy of the Romans. On being taken
before Vespasian, he boldly predicted that within a short
time the empire would fall to the share of that general.
This prediction being afterwards fulfilled, he secured a
favourable reception from the Romans, though he was
retained as a prisoner on account of the use which Ves-
pasian intended to make of him in the farther prosecution
of the war against the Jews.
As soon
as Vespasian was seated on the imperial
throne, Josephus was set at liberty, and was taken by
Titus with him, when he marched to lay siege to Jeru-
salem. Here he saw the ruin of his country, of which
he afterwards became the historian.

MARINO FALIERO, Doge of Venice, nearly fourscore
years of age, was married to a young wife.Soon after
their
union, a giddy young nobleman, named Steno, whom
the Doge had had occasion to disgrace in public, wrote
some verses in his chair of state, reflecting on the conduct
of his wife. The Doge having discovered the author of
this lampoon, complained of him to the senate, who,
upon proof of the charge, sentenced him to only a month's
confinement. The Doge considering this as altogether
inadequate to the reparation of bis injured honour, imme-
diately conceived a must inveterate animosity against the
whole body of the nobility, aud put himself at the head of
a conspiracy, which had just been organized for the
overthrow of the government, by certain plebeian mal-
contents. One of the faction, however, by name Ber-
tram, had a friend in the senate whom he wished to pre-

serve, and having visited him on the eve of the insurrec-
tion, he used such ambiguous language in warning him
not to leave his palace, as led to the detection of the plot.
The Doge and his associates were arrested and brought
to trial. Their execution followed.
Such is alike the historical and dramatic story of this
play.

ELOCUTION OF POPULAR ASSEMBLIES.

(1)
In the course of Mr. Burke's parliamentary exertions
during the six years in which he represented Bristol, he
had the misfortune to offend the political and commercial,
as well as the religious prejudices of many of his consti-
tuents.
A proclamation for dissolving the Parliament, and for
calling a new one, having been issued on the 1st of Sep-
tember, 1780, Mr. Burke repaired to Bristol with all
possible despatch; but, previously to his making any
trial of his strength against three candidates who had
started before him, he entered into a justification of his
public conduct in a speech addressed to a numerous
meeting of the freemen, convened by the Mayor at the
Guildhall, on the 6th of September.
From this speech I have taken my extracts.
(2)
MR. HOWARD was an English gentleman of indepen-
dent fortune, who distinguished himself by his philan-
thropy. Having visited the prisons of Great Britain, he
travelled through the whole of the northern kingdoms of
Europe, and seemed resolved to take no repose while
any
thing remained in which he thought his labours might
serve the interests of humanity. He took his way by the
south of France, through Italy. to Malta, Zante, Smyrna,
and Constantinople. From ale last named city he re-
turned to Smyrna, where he knew the plague then pre-
vailed, for the express purpose of going to Venice with a
“ Foul Bill," as it is called, that he might be subjected to
all the rigour of a quarantine in a lazaretto, in order that
he might practically know its rules. He excited the ad-
miration of all Europe, but at length fell a victim to his
benevolence. Having visited the town of Cherson, on
the Black Sea, where a most malignant fever prevailed,
he caught the contagion, and was carried off on the 20th
of January, 1790, about the age of sixty-three. He was
buried in the neighbourhood of Cherson, and all honours
were paid to his memory by Prince Potemkin, and other
men in office.

Upon the conclusion of this speech, the company
passed several resolutions ic favour of Mr. Burke. 'He
accordingly offered himself as a candidate, and entered,
uporr a contest, which was vigorously supported by his
friends for three days. But finding the tide of prejudice
too strong against him, he declined a continuance of the
poll.
On Thursday, the 18th of September, a numerous body
of the electors of Westminster assembled at the Crown
and Anchor in the Strand, in pursuance of a requisition,
to consider of a proper person to succeed their late much
lamented representative, Mr. Fox. Earl Percy and Mr.
Sheridan were successively put in nomination, when the
latter, who was present, addressed the meeting.

most eligible person to succeed Mr. Fox.

The Historical Society of the University of Dublin
having been denied the protection of College for reasons
