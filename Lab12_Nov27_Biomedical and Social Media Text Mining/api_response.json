Prone position ventilation (PPV) is an important ventilation strategy in the management of patients with ARDS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of PPV in ventilation strategies for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Three hundred patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Shanxi Bethune Hospital from January 2020 to June 2021 were retrospectively collected. Based on body position and conscious state, all patients were divided into three groups: intubation prone position group (n= 110), awake prone position group (n= 90) and supine position group (n= 100); The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) scores, blood gas indicators, complications and other relevant clinical indicators were compared among the three groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare means between multiple groups for quantitative information that conformed to a normal distribution. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for repeated measures data. Component comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis H rank sum test for non-normally distributed quantitative data. RESULTS: One-way repeated-measures ANOVA main effect analysis showed different effects of different treatments on PaO2 in patients with COVID-19 (F treatment = 256.231, P< 0.05), with the order of awake prone position group > intubation prone position group > supine position group.

However, it remains unknown if there is a potential genetic predispositional effect. OBJECTIVE: To examine potential effects of genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 on the risk and progression of AD, we performed a non-overlapping 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). METHODS: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of over 2.6 million subjects was used to examine whether genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is not associated with the risk of AD, cortical amyloid burden, hippocampal volume, or AD progression score. Additionally, a validation analysis was performed on a combined sample size of 536,190 participants. RESULTS: We show that the AD risk was not associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 risk (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.19) and COVID-19 severity (COVID-19 hospitalization: OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.9-1.07, and critical COVID-19: OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.92-1.03). Genetic predisposition to COVID-19 is not associated with AD progression as measured by hippocampal volume, cortical amyloid beta load, and AD progression score. These findings were replicated in a set of 536,190 participants. Consistent results were obtained across models based on different GWAS summary statistics, MR estimators and COVID-19 definitions.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined OTs' perceptions of the feasibility of conducting tele-assessment and developing a clinical practice guideline for remote prescription of assistive devices for older adults in Singapore. METHODS: Eligible OTs were recruited from purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via a virtual platform (Zoom). Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis using a line-by-line coding method was used to identify common trends. RESULTS: Interviews with 10 participants revealed three main themes: (1) therapists' perceptions of the feasibility of tele-assessment, (2) criteria for safe and appropriate prescription of assistive devices via tele-assessment, and (3) practical considerations for the implementation of tele-assessment. Participants felt that tele-assessment increases efficiency with more older adults being more receptive towards technology. They also raised suggestions to address OTs' concerns regarding the safety and accuracy prescription of assistive devices following tele-assessment. This included establishing the client's suitability for assistive device prescription, characteristics of assistive devices, resources required, and considering the preferences of stakeholders involved. CONCLUSION: Tele-assessment for assistive device prescription by OTs appears feasible in Singapore. OTs should consider collaborating with other stakeholders to develop a tele-assessment clinical practice guideline for assistive device prescription.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess sleep hygiene habits and self-reported sleep quality in people working from home in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHOD: This study was designed as a cross-sectional web-based survey. An anonymous questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic variables and questions about personal habits, e.g., exercise activities and caffeine consumption. The outcome measures to assess sleep hygiene and sleep quality were the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) before and after the home office (HO) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: A total of 204 responses were received. The prevalence of significant sleep disturbance (PSQI >  5) was 51 % . The mean PSQI and SHI scores were 6.15+-3.385 and 17.67+-7.836, respectively. PSQI and SHI showed a significant mutual positive correlation at the level of significance p <  0.001. The total score for SHI was similar before and after working from home (p = 0.982). However, differences were observed in its components. CONCLUSION: The total score on SHI did not change when compared before and during HO.

Vaccination rates vary across facilities, but those of SOT centers in Japan have never been investigated. This study aimed to conduct a nationwide questionnaire survey to assess pre- and post-transplant vaccination policies among SOT facilities in Japan. METHODS: The survey was conducted from September to November 2022. All registered (n = 221) solid organ (namely, the lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and small intestine) transplant facilities were asked to complete a web-based survey. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 70.2 %. Live and inactivated vaccines were recommended at 64.9 % and 68.9 % of the responding facilities, respectively. The following vaccines were incorporated into the vaccination protocols of facilities: pneumococcal vaccine, 31.7 % (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and 65.4 % (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine); hepatitis B virus vaccine, 67.3 %; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, 73.1 %; influenza vaccine, 73.1 %; and zoster vaccines, 23.1 %. The reasons for unresponsiveness to vaccinations included inadequate time before transplantation (60.3 %), cost burden (41.1 %), high number of vaccinations (21.9 %), no recognition of the need for vaccination (17.9 %), and the requirement to explain the need for vaccination (15.2 %).

Thus, we set out to evaluate the humoral response after the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. For this purpose, samples from a cohort of 81 LTR and 27 IC were extracted between 21 and 90 days after the third dose. Serology for anti-Spike IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants were evaluated. We found that 73.5 % of LTR were responders for anti-Spike IgG, while all the IC mounted a measurable response. LTR who responded to the third dose showed significantly lower anti-Spike IgG levels and neutralizing antibodies than IC. We found that there is less neutralization in LTR compared to IC across all variants. Specifically, the neutralization titers in both groups decrease when encountering the Delta variant, and this decline is even more pronounced with the Omicron variant, compared to the Wuhan variant. Furthermore, we identified that the use of high doses of mycophenolate and advanced age were factors that negatively affected the development of anti-Spike IgG antibodies. Regarding vaccine regimes, the regime viral vector/mRNA/mRNA elicited significantly higher responses in LTR compared to other vaccine schemes.

METHODS: Individuals aged >=40years enrolled in the prospective population-based Three Villages Study cohort were included. Sleep quality was assessed by means of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Study participants were evaluated at baseline and at every annual door-to-door survey until they remained enrolled in the study. Mixed models Poisson regression for repeated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index determinations and multivariate Cox-proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate mortality risk according to sleep quality. RESULTS: Analysis included 1494 individuals (mean age: 56.6 +- 12.5years; 56% women) followed for a median of 6.3 +- 3.3years. At baseline, 978 (65%) individuals had good sleep quality and 516 (35%) had poor sleep quality. The effects of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores changing over time on mortality was confounded by the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on both. One hundred ninety-five individuals (13%) died during the follow-up, resulting in a crude mortality rate of 1.58 per 100 person years (95% C.I.: 1.27-1.88) for individuals with good sleep quality, and 3.18 (95% C.I.: 2.53-3.82) for those with poor sleep quality at baseline. A multivariate Cox-proportional hazards model showed that individuals with poor sleep quality at baseline were 1.38 times (95% C.I.: 1.02-1.85) more likely to die compared to those with good sleep quality; in this model, increased age, poor physical activity, and high fasting glucose remained significant.

A total of 118 ITP patients, with 97 chronic ITP and 21 persistent ITP, who received inactivated COVID-19 immunization were investigated retrospectively. Following vaccination (within 1 month), ITP patients reported platelet dropping (31.36%), new bleeding events (22.88%), increases in bleeding scores (23.73%), and new treatment requirements (22.03%). Among them, persistent ITP patients with disease duration of 3-12 months had higher ratios of the above adverse events (71.43%, 57.14%, 61.90% and 71.43%, respectively) than chronic ITP patients with duration > 1 year (22.68%, 15.46%, 15.46% and 11.34%, respectively); patients' disease duration was negatively correlated with platelet dropping events and new treatment requirements. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis also supported the above findings, revealing that persistent ITP patients had 9.40-9.70, 7.24-10.08, and 27.17-28.51 times incidence of having platelet dropping events, new bleeding events, and new treatment requirements after vaccination, respectively, when compared to chronic ITP patients. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that after receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, ITP patients may experience platelet dropping, which may lead to new bleeding events and the requirement of a new round of treatment for ITP recurrence.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey of first responders (n = 2801) to understand the relationship between work pressures, workplace support strategies, and problematic substance use during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We employed structural equation modeling to analyze whether burnout mediated these relationships. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics showed that 60.8 % reported no concerns with substance use. While general workplace support strategies were negatively associated with problematic substance use, specific COVID-related strategies, such as providing compensation during quarantine, were positively associated with problematic substance use. Burnout fully mediated relationships between workplace support strategies and problematic substance use. Finally, providing spaces at work to decompress was negatively associated with problematic substance use and burnout. CONCLUSION: Although work pressures increased burnout and problematic substance use among first responders, general workplace support strategies (e.g., decompression spaces) reduced problematic substance use while some COVID-related strategies (e.g. compensation during quarantine) increased problematic substance use. Policy interventions to address problematic substance use should focus on providing spaces for first responders to decompress at work, as well as implementing strategies (e.g., access to mental health services, time off) to reduce burnout.

This was attributed to fatigue during the standard 2-min rescuer rotations. We hypothesized that in such situations, rotating rescuers every one minute, instead of the standard two minutes would improve CPR quality. AIM: To compare the quality of chest compressions when rescuers wearing N95 masks are rotated every one minute, instead of the standard practice of two-minute rotations. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, crossover trial was conducted, with the approval of the institutional Ethics Committee. Medical students who volunteered as rescuers were trained to perform high-quality chest compressions on a manikin, and then randomly allocated into pairs. Each pair was randomized to one of two trial groups viz. one-minute rotations crossed-over to two-minute rotations; and vice versa. Thus, each pair performed CPR with one-minute rotations, as well as two-minute rotations Each CPR session included chest compressions for a duration of 12 min. The outcome parameters included CPR quality, compression depth, compression rate, and chest compression fraction. Rescuer fatigue was measured before and after each study session using the modified Borg scale. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants completed the study. The overall CPR quality was statistically similar in the study arms (median 88% vs. 81%, p = 0.09). However, the minute-to-minute inter-arm comparison revealed significantly lower CPR quality in the 2-min rotation arm, at the end of minutes 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 (respective p-values 0.03, 0.001, 0.008, 0.02, 0.002). A similar trend was observed in compression depth also. Rescuer fatigue score was significantly less with 1-min rotations compared to 2-min rotations (p < 0.001). Rescuer vital signs and cardiorespiratory parameters were not different with the two types of rotations. CONCLUSION: During CPR performed by rescuers wearing N95 masks, the quality of CPR appears to be superior with rescuers rotating at 1-min instead of 2-min intervals.

A validated health literacy assessment instrument was used to gather data on their health literacy levels. Two semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant to explore the experiences of recovery in the immediate and medium-term post-discharge period. The data from the assessment instrument and the interviews were analysed and collated. Data analysis gave rise to seven themes: aftermath of cardiac surgery; settling in; whirlwind of emotions; shifting perspective; faith and hope; sense of community; and COVID-19 experience.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric hospital surgical unit in Pakistan between 1 January 2021 and 1 June 2021 on the enrolled neonates and children aged 1 day to 13 years. All patients from three different pediatric strata [neonates (<1 month), infants (1 to 12 months) and children (>1 year)] were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Six-hundred patients were enrolled, and 426 patients were included in the study. Among 426 patients, 234 (54.9%) were male, and 192 (45.1%) were female. Overall only 118 (27.7%) patients developed symptoms. The other 308 (72.3%) were asymptomatic of which 28 (9.1%) had fever, 28 (9.1%) had cough, 38 (12.33%) had body aches, 292 (94.8%) had vomiting/diarrhea, and only 28 (9.1%) developed loss of smell and taste. Our results showed seropositivity of 27.7% (n = 118), while 72.3% (n = 308) had negative antibody titers. CONCLUSION: A much higher pediatric SARS-CoV-2 burden of 27.7% was found in our pediatric surgical unit than has previously been reported in the literature of 6.8% for children in pediatric hospitals or pediatric surgical units. Contrary to reporting early in the COVID-19 pandemic, this study determined that children experience a significant burden of COVID-19 infection.

A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution was fit to the data, adjusting for potential confounders. A marked increase in B19V was observed in 2023, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 6.6 (95% CI 6.33-6.89) when comparing 2023 to previous years. When specifically comparing 2023 to COVID-19 years (2020-2022), adjusted IRR climbs to 9.21 (8.66-9.80). Moreover, in 2023, previously existing seasonality has largely disappeared. High SES characterized most infected individuals with a marked discrepancy in social sectors; the Arab population was significantly less likely to be found B19V positive, even when adjusting for SES. Most infections occurred in school-aged children (6-11 years old). Pregnant women experienced the most significant rise in B19V, with an adjusted IRR of 11.47 (9.44-13.97) in 2023 compared to previous years; most cases were diagnosed in the first trimester.

This prospective observational study aimed to explore the association between CAPA development and the incidence and prognosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We included all consecutive critically ill adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to three COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs) in an Italian hospital from 25 February 2020 to 8 May 2022. A standardized procedure was employed for early detection of CAPA. Risk factors associated with CAPA and CMV reactivation and the association between CMV recurrence and mortality were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models. CAPA occurred in 96 patients (16.6%) of the 579 patients analyzed. Among the CAPA population, 40 (41.7%) patients developed CMV blood reactivation with a median time of 18 days (IQR 7-27). The CAPA+CMV group did not exhibit a significantly higher 90-day mortality rate (62.5% vs. 48.2%) than the CAPA alone group (p = 0.166). The CAPA+CMV group had a longer ICU stay, fewer ventilation-free days, and a higher rate of secondary bacterial infections than the control group of CAPA alone. In the CAPA population, prior immunosuppression was the only independent risk factor for CMV reactivation (HR 2.33, 95% C.I. 1.21-4.48, p = 0.011). In critically ill COVID-19 patients, CMV reactivation is common in those with a previous CAPA diagnosis. Basal immunosuppression before COVID-19 appeared to be the primary independent variable affecting CMV reactivation in patients with CAPA.

The objective of this study was to assess the immune response and the effects of vaccination in recovered individuals with variable disease severity up to one year following natural infection. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted including patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Disease severity was classified as mild, moderate, and severe based on clinical presentation and outcomes. Anti-RBD (receptor binding domain) and neutralizing antibodies were evaluated at multiple timepoints during the first year after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included; of them, 28 were diagnosed with mild, 38 with moderate, and 40 with severe disease. At least one vaccine dose was administered in 58 individuals during the follow-up. Participants with mild disease presented significantly lower anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies compared to those with moderate and severe disease up to the 3rd and 6th months after the infection, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, in the third month, severe COVID-19 was associated with significantly higher anti-RBD (beta: 563.09; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 257.02 to 869.17) and neutralizing (beta: 21.47; 95% CI: 12.04 to 30.90) antibodies. Among vaccinated individuals, at the 12th month, a history of moderate disease was associated with significantly higher anti-RBD levels (beta: 5615.19; 95% CI: 657.92 to 10,572.46). CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 is associated with higher anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies up to 6 months after the infection.

In this prospective study, the primary aim is to compare the ROX (easily administered in resource limited setting) to APACHE II for clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and the need for intubation. Our secondary aim was to identify thresholds for the ROX index in predicting outcomes such as the length of ICU stay and failure of non-invasive respiratory support therapies and to assess the effectiveness of using the ROX (day 1 at admission, day 2, and day 3) versus Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores (at admission) in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) to predict early, late, and non-responders. After screening 208 intensive care unit patients, a total of 118 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, who were categorized into early (n = 38), late (n = 34), and non-responders (n = 46). Multinomial logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Multivariate Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were conducted. Multinomial logistic regressions between late and early responders and between non- and early responders were associated with reduced risk of treatment failures. ROC analysis for early vs. late responders showed that APACHE II on admission had the largest area under the curve (0.847), followed by the ROX index on admission (0.843). For responders vs. non-responders, we found that the ROX index on admission had a slightly better AUC than APACHE II on admission (0.759 vs. 0.751). A higher ROX index on admission [HR (95% CI): 0.29 (0.13-0.52)] and on day 2 [HR (95% CI): 0.55 (0.34-0.89)] were associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure.

RESULTS: As of December 2022, Mexican health authorities and the scientific community have sequenced up to 81,983 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes deposited in GISAID, representing 1.1% of confirmed cases. The number of sequences obtained per state corresponded to the gross domestic product (GDP) of each state for the first (Mexico City) and the last (Tlaxcala). Approximately 25% of the sequences were obtained from CoViGen-Mex, an interdisciplinary initiative of health and scientific institutions to collect and sequence samples nationwide. The metadata showed a clear dominance of sequences retrieved by women. A similar variant distribution over time was found in Mexico and overseas, with the Omicron variant predominating. Finally, the age group with the highest representation in the sequences was adults aged 21 to 50 years, accounting for more than 50% of the total.

The purpose of this research was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the North Backa district while observing seven pandemic waves. The cross-sectional study was based on data from the COVID-19 surveillance database of the Institute for Public Health of Vojvodina during the period from March 2020 to December 2022. A total of 38,685 primary infections and 4067 reinfections caused by SARS-CoV-2 were notified. Pandemic waves caused by the Delta variant (cumulative incidence rate of 2482.37/100,000) and by the Omicron variant (cumulative incidence rate of 2994.45/100,000) emerged as significant focal points during the surveillance period. Over the course of three consecutive years (2020-2022), women were more affected (50.11%, 54.03%, and 55.68%, respectively). The highest incidence rates in age-specific categories were recorded in 2021 for the age group 40-49 (1345.32 per 10,000 inhabitants), while in 2022, they shifted towards the elderly population. Regarding vaccination status at the time of diagnosis, in 2021, around 15% of patients were vaccinated, while in 2022, the number increased to 37%. The most widely received vaccine was BBIBP-CorV (67.45%), followed by BNT162b2 (19.81%), Gam-COVID-Vac (9.31%), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (3.42%) vaccine. The implementation of stringent public health measures and their mitigation, together with the emergence of new variants, influenced the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic waves in the North Backa district.

The aim of this study was to experimentally compare the accuracy of SpO2 measurement of popular smartwatches with a clinically used pulse oximeter according to the requirements of ISO 80601-2-61. Each of the 18 young and healthy participants underwent the experimental assessment three times in randomized order-wearing Apple Watch 8, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, or Withings ScanWatch-resulting in 54 individual experimental assessments and complete datasets. The accuracy of the SpO2 measurements was compared to that of the Radical-7 (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) during short-term hypoxemia induced by consecutive inhalation of three prepared gas mixtures with reduced oxygen concentrations (14%, 12%, and 10%).

There were equal proportions of individuals reporting decreased, increased, or no change in body weight, BMI, and dietary habits due to COVID-19, with no significant gender differences observed.

A total of 105 full-length genome viral sequences obtained from naturally infected cats during the pandemic were evaluated by distinct evolutionary algorithms. Analyses were enhanced, including a set of highly related SARS-CoV-2 sequences recovered from human populations. Our results showed the apparent high susceptibility of cats to the infection SARS-CoV-2 compared with other animal species. Evolutionary analyses indicated that the phylogenomic characteristics displayed by cat populations were influenced by the dominance of specific SARS-CoV-2 genetic groups affecting human populations. However, disparate dN/dS rates at some genes between populations recovered from cats and humans suggested that infection in these two species may suggest a different evolutionary constraint for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the branch selection analysis showed evidence of the potential role of natural selection in the emergence of five distinct cat lineages during the pandemic.

Therefore, the discovery of new and effective antiviral agents is desperately needed. Animal venoms are a rich source of bioactive molecules found in natural goods that have been used since ancient times in alternative medicine to treat a variety of human diseases. Recently, and with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have regained their interest in the possible use of natural products, such as bee venom (BV), as a potential antiviral agent to treat viral infections. BV is known to exert many therapeutic activities such as anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is limited discussion of the antiviral activity of BV in the literature. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the antiviral properties of BV and its two primary constituents, melittin (MEL) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), against a variety of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Finally, the innovative strategies used to reduce the toxicity of BV and its two compounds for the development of new antiviral treatments are also considered.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 164, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001102", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viral infections", "locations": [{"offset": 291, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 356, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 627, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 679, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001102", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viral infections", "locations": [{"offset": 843, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "5319", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "715"}, "text": "phospholipase A2", "locations": [{"offset": 1198, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "5319", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "715"}, "text": "PLA2", "locations": [{"offset": 1216, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D064420", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "toxicity", "locations": [{"offset": 1335, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 38003818, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1701105953283}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D001102", "disease@MESH:D003643", "gene@5319", "disease@MESH:D064420", "species@9606"], "journal": "Pathogens", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Yaacoub C", "Wehbe R", "Roufayel R", "Fajloun Z", "Coutard B"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The present study showed no significant difference in the viral load between male and female hamsters and peak infection was found to be on day four post infection in both sexes of the animals. Live virus particles were detected up to 5 days post infection (dpi) through the TCID-50 assay, while qRT-PCR could detect viral RNA up to 14 dpi from all the infected animals. Further, the determination of the neutralizing antibody titer showed the onset of the humoral immune response as early as 4 dpi in both sexes against SARS-CoV-2, and a significant cross-protection against the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was observed. Histopathology showed edema, inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, and degeneration of alveolar and bronchial epithelium cells from 3 dpi to 14 dpi in both sexes. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed up to 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SARS-CoV-2 (ancestral Wuhan strain) genome isolated from both male and female hamsters. The mutation observed at the 23014 position (Glu484Asp) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from both sexes of the hamsters plays a significant role in the antiviral efficacy of small molecules, vaccines, and the Mabs-targeting S protein. The present study shows that either of the genders can be used in the pre-clinical efficacy of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters. However, considering the major mutation in the S protein, the understanding of the genetic mutation in SARS-CoV-2 after passing through hamsters is crucial in deciding the efficacy of the antiviral agents targeting the S protein.

This study analyzed nasal swabs and blood samples collected from randomly selected Korean native cattle and Korean native black goats. The tests conducted included real-time qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens, an ELISA to detect antibodies, and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Among the 1798 animals tested (consisting of 1174 Korean native cattle and 624 Korean native black goats), SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in one Korean native cattle and one Korean native black goat. ELISA testing revealed positive results for antibodies in 54 Korean native cattle (4.60%) and 16 Korean native black goats (2.56%), while PRNTs yielded positive results in 51 Korean native cattle (4.34%) and 14 Korean native black goats (2.24%). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and/or antibodies was identified in animals on farms where farmworkers were already infected. It is challenging to completely rule out the possibility of reverse zoonotic transmission from humans to livestock in Korea, although the transmission is not to the same extent as it is in highly susceptible animal species like minks, cats, and dogs. This is due to the limited geographical area and the dense, intensive farming practices implemented in these regions.

Economical, fast, efficient, and sensitive diagnostic tests are needed to analyze animal infection. Double-antigen sandwich ELISA has the advantage of being multispecies and can be used for detecting infections caused by pathogens that infect several animal hosts. This study aimed to develop a double-antigen sandwich ELISA using two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, N and RBD. We compared its performance, when using these proteins separately, with an indirect ELISA and with a surrogate virus neutralization test. Positive and negative controls from a cat population (n = 31) were evaluated to compare all of the tests. After confirming that double-antigen sandwich ELISA with both RBD and N proteins had the best performance (AUC= 88%), the cutoff was adjusted using positive and negative samples from cats, humans (n = 32) and guinea pigs (n = 3). The use of samples from tigers (n = 2) and rats (n = 51) showed good agreement with the results previously obtained using the microneutralization test.

However, dynamic changes and prognostic value of this biomarker in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have not been determined. METHODS: A total of 124 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were prospectively recruited for the study. Serial blood samples were obtained at the time of admission (D1), 3-4 days following standard-care treatments (D2), and 1-2 days prior to discharge or any time collected prior to death (D3). Plasma VWF antigen, ADAMTS13 antigen, and ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity, as well as the ratio of VWF/ADAMTS13 were determined, followed by various statistical analyses. RESULTS: On admission, plasma levels of VWF in COVID-19 patients were significantly elevated compared with those in the healthy controls, but no statistical significance was detected among patients with different disease severity. Plasma ADAMTS13 activity but not its antigen levels were significantly lower in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 compared with that in other patient groups. Interestingly, the ratios of plasma VWF antigen to ADAMTS13 antigen were significantly higher in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 than in those with mild to moderate disease. More importantly, plasma levels of VWF and the ratios of VWF/ADAMTS13 were persistently elevated in patients with COVID-19 throughout hospitalization. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses demonstrated that an increased plasma level of VWF or ratio of VWF/ADAMTS13 at D2 and D3 was associated with an increased mortality rate.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 226 patients with confirmed SAT diagnosed from January 2020 to November 2022. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.01 +- 0.75 years, and the F/M ratio was 2.3/1. At the end of the follow-up period, 69 patients (32.1%) had developed hypothyroidism. Treatment duration was significantly shorter with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (17.40 +- 2.56 days), while time-to-symptom relief was shorter with glucocorticoids (CGs). Recurrence was observed only in those treated with corticosteroid preparations (14.1%). C-reactive protein levels at treatment discontinuation were higher in patients who experienced SAT recurrence, while the coexistence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was a significant predictive factor for the development of hypothyroidism. The TSH value at the time of treatment withdrawal >4.12 muIU/mL showed optimal sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of permanent hypothyroidism. Regarding COVID-19, 34 patients (15%) experienced related SAT, with similar clinical manifestations of the disease but a higher BMI and shorter time-to-symptom relief. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, GCs administration alleviated acute symptoms earlier during the onset of SAT, whereas NSAIDs had a shorter treatment duration, and both regimens could not prevent the development of delayed hypothyroidism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal survey was conducted over three years (2020-2022) involving 168 families. The survey included data on demographics, diagnosed conditions, access to therapies, mental well-being, and perceived challenges. RESULTS: The study involved 62, 51, and 55 families in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. ADHD emerged as the most prevalent condition, diagnosed in approximately 32% of the children. The pandemic significantly affected therapy access, with parents reporting a decrease from an average score of 8.1 in 2020 to 6.5 in 2022 (p = 0.029). Parents also reported increased feelings of being overwhelmed, peaking at 8.0 in 2021 before declining to 6.3 in 2022 (p = 0.017). Despite these challenges, there was a positive trend in family mental well-being, with scores increasing from 5.1 in 2020 to 6.7 in 2022 (p = 0.031). The Parental Stress Index (PSI) indicated decreasing trends in Emotional Stress and Parent-Child Communication Difficulties (p < 0.001), and Behavioral Challenges in children showed a significant reduction across the years (p < 0.001). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) reflected a moderate reduction in anxiety levels from 7.6 in 2020 to 6.0 in 2022 (p = 0.038), although depression scores did not show a significant change. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic introduced notable challenges for families with neuropsychiatrically diagnosed children, particularly in therapy access and increased parental stress. However, the study also reveals a general improvement in family dynamics, mental well-being, and a decrease in behavioral challenges over time. The necessity of this study stems from the critical need to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families with neuropsychiatrically diagnosed children, focusing on their resilience and adaptation in navigating therapy access, parental stress, and overall mental well-being.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 207, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 242, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001523", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neuropsychiatric disorders", "locations": [{"offset": 266, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001289", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "ADHD", "locations": [{"offset": 676, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 760, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Stress", "locations": [{"offset": 1215, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Stress", "locations": [{"offset": 1275, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Child", "locations": [{"offset": 1293, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1368, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1451, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Depression", "locations": [{"offset": 1463, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1521, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 1590, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1660, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1757, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2059, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2125, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 38002782, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1701105953283}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D001007", "disease@MESH:D001289", "disease@MESH:D000079225", "disease@MESH:D000275", "disease@MESH:D001523", "species@9606"], "journal": "J Clin Med", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Gruescu ACS", "Popoiu C", "Levai MC", "Burtic SR", "Sanda II", "Neda-Stepan O", "Rosca O", "Fericean RM", "Dumitru C", "Stelea L"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 694 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from clinical records. Radiomic data were extracted from CT. Patients were randomized to the training (80%, n = 556) or test (20%, n = 138) dataset. The training set was used to define the association between severity of disease and comorbidities, laboratory tests, demographic, and CT-based radiomic variables, and to implement a risk-prediction model. The model was evaluated using the C statistic and Brier scores. The test set was used to assess model prediction performance. RESULTS: Patients who died (n = 157) were predominantly male (66%) over the age of 50 with median (range) C-reactive protein (CRP) = 5 [1, 37] mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) = 494 [141, 3631] U/I, and D-dimer = 6.006 [168, 152.015] ng/mL.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from leukapheresis cones. The humoral immune response was assessed by measuring serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit IgG via semiquantitative ELISA, and T-cell immunity against S1 and S2 subunits were studied via IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) and flow cytometric (FC) activation-induced marker (AIM) assays and the assessment of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell function (in the subset of HLA-A2-positive patients).

Current research utilizes X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, conventional X-ray scans expose patients to excessive radiation, rendering repeated examinations impractical. Ultra-low-dose X-ray imaging technology enables rapid and accurate COVID-19 detection with minimal additional radiation exposure. In this retrospective cohort study, ULTRA-X-COVID, a deep neural network specifically designed for automatic detection of COVID-19 infections using ultra-low-dose X-ray images, is presented. The study included a multinational and multicenter dataset consisting of 30,882 X-ray images obtained from approximately 16,600 patients across 51 countries. It is important to note that there was no overlap between the training and test sets. The data analysis was conducted from 1 April 2020 to 1 January 2022. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, various metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, receiver operating characteristic, accuracy, specificity, and F1 score were utilized. In the test set, the model demonstrated an AUC of 0.968 (95% CI, 0.956-0.983), accuracy of 94.3%, specificity of 88.9%, and F1 score of 99.0%. Notably, the ULTRA-X-COVID model demonstrated a performance comparable to conventional X-ray doses, with a prediction time of only 0.1 s per image. These findings suggest that the ULTRA-X-COVID model can effectively identify COVID-19 cases using ultra-low-dose X-ray scans, providing a novel alternative for COVID-19 detection.

This is also known as \"long COVID\" and includes symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, et cetera. The COVID-19 virus may trigger hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine levels in the body. COVID-19 can trigger inflammation in the joints, which can lead to osteoarthritis (OA), while long-term COVID-19 symptoms may lead to joint damage and other inflammation problems. According to several studies, sesame has potent anti-inflammatory properties due to its major constituent, sesamin. This study examined sesamin's anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoarthritis, and anti-COVID-19 effects. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro assays were used to determine sesamin's anti-inflammatory activity against the RAW264.7 and SW1353 cell lines. Sesamin had a dose-dependent effect (20 mg/kg) in a monoiodoacetic acid (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis rat model. Sesamin reduced paw swelling and joint discomfort. In addition, the findings indicated that sesamin suppressed the expression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in the RAW264.7 cell line within the concentration range of 6.25-50 muM. Furthermore, sesamin also had a suppressive effect on MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) expression in chondrocytes and the SW1353 cell line within the same concentration range of 6.25-50 muM. To examine the anti-viral activity, an in silico analysis was performed to evaluate sesamin's binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Compared to the controls, sesamin exhibited strong binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and human ACE2. Furthermore, sesamin had a higher binding affinity for the ACE2 target protein.

Understanding its impact on patients' health is important for the development of personalized rehabilitation interventions. An independent association between obesity and post-COVID condition was found because of complications and comorbidities. METHODS: Sixteen patients with obesity and post-COVID symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, pain, poor sleep quality, muscle fatigue), admitted to the Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Piancavallo (VB), Italy, were recruited for a four-week rehabilitation program including conventional exercise therapy, nutritional intervention, psychological support and whole-body cryostimulation (WBC). RESULTS: All participants attended all sessions of the program. Anthropometric data showed statistically significant changes in weight, waist circumference and body mass index. Biochemical analyses showed significant reductions in lipid and inflammatory profiles.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science (PROSPERO: CRD42022292176). The population was patients receiving HA therapy for ARDS. The primary outcome was the change in PaO2/FiO2 before and after HA therapy. Secondary outcomes included the before and after values for C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and norepinephrine (NE) doses. RESULTS: We included 26 publications, with 243 patients (198 undergoing HA therapy and 45 controls).

The immunization of mice and monkeys with this chimeric protein was able to induce a high N-specific IgG response with only two doses in pre-clinical experiments. In order to explore ways to diminish protein degradation, in the present work, the N and N-CD proteins were produced in suspension cultures and serum-free media following transient transfection of the HEK-293 clone 3F6, at different scales, including stirred-tank controlled bioreactors. The results showed negligible or no degradation of the target proteins. Further, clones stably expressing N-CD were obtained and adapted to suspension culture, obtaining similar results to those observed in the transient expression experiments in HEK-293-3F6.

The patient's muscle strength may be reduced during the acute phase of the infection. Electrical bioimpedance (BIA) is a non-invasive method for measuring body compartments and estimating visceral fat area (VFA) that can be used at the bedside. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between several body composition parameters, primarily high adipose tissue and high VFA, in patients with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, and whether it worsened the severity parameters. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a private hospital in the city of Sao Paulo from March 2020 to August 2021. The demographic and clinical data was collected from medical reports. Body composition is assessed using the InBODY  model S10 bioelectrical impedance device and a Jamar  digital hydraulic manual dynamometer with a scale from 0 to 90 kg is used to measure handgrip strength (HGS). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 69.1 years (SD 15) were divided into two groups of 48 individuals, with and without COVID-19 infection. Body mass index (odds ratio [OR]: 4.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69, 11.83), fat mass (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 0.48, 8.55), and VFA (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.33, 3.53) were all higher in the infection group. When COVID-19 patients were evaluated, those with higher VFA had longer hospital stays (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.01) and used more vasoactive drugs (p = 0.043). Patients with COVID-19 with poor handgrip strength were 3.29 times more likely to require a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that excess weight and body fat are significantly associated with COVID-19 involvement, but the severity is primarily related to a greater area of visceral fat. The use of bioimpedance for visceral fat measurement was effective, as it is a simple method performed in the hospital setting that does not require the use of radiation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 151, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 179, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 262, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 333, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 632, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 673, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 682, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1180, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1292, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1301, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1499, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1521, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1530, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1678, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1692, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1910, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 38001401, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1701105953283}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "species@9606"], "journal": "BMC Infect Dis", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Carvalho JB", "de Andrade GKP", "do Nascimento LA", "Golin N", "Rodrigues ALCC", "Suiter E", "Soprani MVO", "Nadolskis AS"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Blood cell counts improved in the post-COVID period, but 81% of patients had persistent abnormalities, compared with 50% in the control group, p < 0.001. Most common haematological findings included anaemia (40%), reduced lymphocyte (43%) or eosinophil counts (38%) and low IgM memory B cells and correlated with advanced age, number of chronic comorbidities, female gender, altered renal function, reduced baseline Hb and procalcitonin concentrations and increased RDW. Data on lymphocytes and IgM memory B cells show that impaired immune responses may persist for up to one year in the post-COVID period, possibly contributing to long-term symptoms, especially in female patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 90, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 109, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 167, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 181, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004417", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "shortness of breath", "locations": [{"offset": 196, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005221", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fatigue", "locations": [{"offset": 217, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013651", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "loss of taste", "locations": [{"offset": 226, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003072", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cognitive deterioration", "locations": [{"offset": 253, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 385, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 439, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 540, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 687, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 785, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 810, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000740", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anaemia", "locations": [{"offset": 945, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C029100", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "procalcitonin", "locations": [{"offset": 1169, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1339, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1419, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 38001354, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1701105953283}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "chemical@MESH:C029100", "disease@MESH:D000740", "disease@MESH:D013651", "disease@MESH:D005221", "disease@MESH:D003072", "disease@MESH:D004417", "species@9606"], "journal": "Intern Emerg Med", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Bergamaschi G", "Barteselli C", "Calabretta F", "Lenti MV", "Merli S", "Rossi CM", "Di Sabatino A"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

To fill this gap, we propose a pipeline for data processing and identifying features of a series of wastewater test results that can predict the presence of COVID-19 in residences associated with the test sites. Using time series of wastewater results and individual testing results during periods of routine asymptomatic testing among UCSD students from 11/2020 to 11/2021, we develop hierarchical classification/decision tree models to select the most informative wastewater features (patterns of results) which predict individual infections. We find that the best predictor of positive individual level tests in residence buildings is whether or not the wastewater samples were positive in at least 3 of the past 7 days. We also demonstrate that the tree models outperform a wide range of other statistical and machine models in predicting the individual COVID-19 infections while preserving interpretability.

In this study, we performed a secondary analysis of a dataset from the optimization phase of Soapp, an app to promote hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants (N = 216) were randomized to different versions of Soapp and used an electronic diary to self-report their hand hygiene behavior multiple times during the study. We considered the following indicators of the COVID-19 pandemic from the country of Switzerland in the period between March and August 2021: total cases/deaths, increases in recent new cases/deaths, new cases/deaths, and number of administered doses of vaccine. Data were analyzed using a multilevel approach. Results suggested that there were no significant associations between hand hygiene and the indicators of the pandemic trajectory.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the relative change in the odds of hospitalization/death with each vaccine dose (2-5) and/or prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (compared with unvaccinated, uninfected subjects) up to 15 months since the last vaccination or infection. RESULTS: We included 18,526 cases with Omicron-associated severe outcomes and 90,778 test-negative controls. Vaccine protection was high during BA.1/BA.2 predominance, but was generally <50% during periods of BA.4/BA.5 and BQ/XBB predominance without boosters. A third/fourth dose transiently increased protection during BA.4/BA.5 predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 68%, 95%CI 63%-72%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 80%, 95%CI 77%-83%), but was lower and waned quickly during BQ/XBB predominance (third-dose, 6-month: 59%, 95%CI 48%-67%; 12-month: 49%, 95%CI 41%-56%; fourth-dose, 6-month: 62%, 95%CI 56%-68%, 12-months: 51%, 95%CI 41%-56%).

Here we provide the most recent, comprehensive characterization of demographic and SES trends in cervical fusions, including during the pandemic. METHODS: We collected the following variables on adults undergoing cervical fusions, 1/1/2004-3/31/2021, in Optum's Clinformatics  Data Mart: age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, provider's practicing state, gender, race, education, and net worth. We performed multivariate linear and logistic regression to evaluate associations of cervical fusion rates with SES variables. RESULTS: Cervical fusion rates increased 2004-2016, then decreased 2016-2020. Proportions of Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients undergoing cervical fusions increased (OR=1.001,1.001,1.004, p<0.01), with a corresponding decrease in White patients (OR=0.996, p<0.001) over time. There were increases in cervical fusions in higher education groups (OR=1.006, 1.002, p<0.001) and lowest net worth group (OR=1.012, p<0.001). During the pandemic, proportions of White (OR=1.015, p<0.01) and wealthier patients (OR>=1.015, p<0.01) undergoing cervical fusions increased. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first documented decrease in annual cervical surgery rates in the U.S. Our data reveal a bimodal distribution for cervical fusion patients, with racial-minority, lower-net-worth, and highly-educated patients receiving increasing proportions of surgical interventions.

Aerosol samples (N = 18) were collected between November 2020 and March 2022 in Castello (Spain) from LTCFs, merchant ships and a private home with recently infected COVID-19 cases. Sampling was performed for 24-h, onto 47 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and quartz filters, connected to personal pumps at 2 and 4 L/min respectively. RNA from filters was extracted and SARS-CoV-2 was determined by detection of regions N1 and N2 of the nucleocapsid gene alongside the E gene using RT-PCR technique. SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was detected in 87.5% samples. Concentrations ranged ND-19,525 gc/m3 (gene E). No genetic traces were detected in rooms from contacts that were isolated as a preventative measure. Very high levels were also measured at locations with poor ventilation. Aerosol measurement conducted with the proposed methodology provided useful information to public health officers and contributed to manage and control 12 different COVID-19 outbreaks.

DATA SOURCES: Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS: All relevant original articles published in English between June 2019 and February 2023 were identified. Studies related to guideline adherence, impact of treatment on immune response and/or microbiology, tympanoplasty, Eustachian tube balloon dilatation, mastoidectomy procedures, and those focusing on children with Down's syndrome or cleft palate were excluded. MAIN FINDINGS: Of the 9280 unique records screened, 64 were eligible for inclusion; 23 studies related to medical treatment, 20 to vaccines, 13 to surgical treatment, 6 to prevention (excl. vaccines) and 2 to the impact of COVID-19 on OM management. The level of evidence was judged 2 in 11 studies (17.2 %) and 3 or 4 in the remaining 53 studies (82.8 %) mainly due to the observational design, study limitations or low sample sizes. Some important advances in OM management have been made in recent years. Video discharge instructions detailing the identification and management of pain and fever for parents of children with acute otitis media (AOM) was more effective than paper instructions in reducing symptomatology; compared to placebo, levofloxacin solution was more effective for treating chronic suppurative otitis media, whereas AOM recurrences during two years of follow-up did not differ between children with recurrent AOM who received tympanostomy tube (TT) insertion or medical management. Further, novel pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) schedules for preventing OM in Aboriginal children appeared ineffective, and a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine had no added value over PCV13 for preventing AOM in native American infants.

OBJECTIVE: We compared nasal swab collection by study participants from themselves and their children at home to collection by trained research staff. METHODS: Each adult participant collected 1 nasal swab, sampling both nares with the single swab, after which they collected 1 nasal swab from 1 child. After all the participant samples were collected for the household, the research staff member collected a separate single duplicate sample from each individual. Immediately after the sample collection, the adult participants completed a questionnaire about the acceptability of the sampling procedures. Swabs were placed in temperature-stable preservative and respiratory viruses were detected by shotgun RNA sequencing, enabling viral genome analysis. RESULTS: In total, 21 households participated in the study, each with 1 adult and 1 child, yielding 42 individuals with paired samples. Study participants reported that self-collection was acceptable. Agreement between identified respiratory viruses in both swabs by RNA sequencing demonstrated that adequate collection technique was achieved by brief instructions.

Older adults may have been able to draw from their personal resources such as psychological resilience (PR) and technology use (TU) to combat such effects. Educational attainment (EA) or early-life EA may potentially shape later-life personal resources and their impact on the effects of the pandemic lockdown on outcomes such as loneliness. The developmental adaptation model allows for the supposition that social isolation, TU, and PR may be affected by early EA in older adults. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the indirect impact of EA on pandemic-linked loneliness in a sample of older adults. The developmental adaptation model was used as the conceptual framework to view EA as a distal influence on loneliness, social isolation, PR, and TU. We hypothesized that EA would predict TU and PR and have a moderating impact on social isolation and loneliness. We also hypothesized that PR and TU would mediate the effect of EA on loneliness. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study, in which data were gathered from 92 older adults aged >=65 years in the United Kingdom from March 2020 to June 2021, when the country was under various pandemic-linked social mobility restrictions. The data captured demographic information including age, gender, ethnicity, and the highest degree of education achieved. The University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Lubben Social Network Index, and Technology Experience Questionnaire were used as standardized measures. Pearson correlation, moderation, and mediation regression analyses were conducted to investigate the hypotheses. RESULTS: We found a higher prevalence of loneliness in older adults than in prepandemic norms. EA was correlated with greater TU and PR and moderated the impact of social isolation on loneliness. PR mediated and TU partially mediated the relationship between EA and loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Early-life EA was confirmed as a distal resource for older adults and played an indirect role in affecting loneliness levels during the pandemic. It has an impact on present-day personal resources, such as PR and TU, which affect loneliness and also moderate the impact of social isolation on loneliness. Policymakers should be aware that older adults with low levels of EA may be more vulnerable to the harmful impacts of loneliness when isolated by choice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 251, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 414, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "5241", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "713"}, "text": "PR", "locations": [{"offset": 1266, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "5241", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "713"}, "text": "PR", "locations": [{"offset": 2300, "length": 2}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999938, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "gene@5241"], "journal": "JMIR Aging", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Balki E", "Hayes N", "Holland C"]}

Continuous remote monitoring of physiological parameters and symptom changes offers the potential for timely intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduced health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a real-time multimodal program using commercially available wearable technology, home-based Bluetooth-enabled spirometers, finger pulse oximeters, and smartphone apps is feasible and acceptable for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, as well as the value of low-burden, long-term passive data collection. METHODS: In a 3-arm prospective observational cohort feasibility study, we recruited 60 patients from the Royal Free Hospital and University College Hospital. These patients had been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post-COVID-19 condition (n=20 per group) and were followed for 180 days. This study used a comprehensive remote monitoring system designed to provide real-time and relevant data for both patients and clinicians. Data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) periodic surveys, Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapses-base active app questionnaires, wearables, finger pulse oximeters, smartphone apps, and Bluetooth home-based spirometry. The feasibility of remote monitoring was measured through adherence to the protocol, engagement during the follow-up period, retention rate, acceptability, and data integrity. RESULTS: Lowest-burden passive data collection methods, via wearables, demonstrated superior adherence, engagement, and retention compared with active data collection methods, with an average wearable use of 18.66 (SD 4.69) hours daily (77.8% of the day), 123.91 (SD 33.73) hours weekly (72.6% of the week), and 463.82 (SD 156.70) hours monthly (64.4% of the month). Highest-burden spirometry tasks and high-burden active app tasks had the lowest adherence, engagement, and retention, followed by low-burden questionnaires. Spirometry and active questionnaires had the lowest retention at 0.5 survival probability, indicating that they were the most burdensome. Adherence to and quality of home spirometry were analyzed; of the 7200 sessions requested, 4248 (59%) were performed. Of these, 90.3% (3836/4248) were of acceptable quality according to American Thoracic Society grading. Inclusion of protocol holidays improved retention measures. The technologies used were generally well received. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring for capturing both subjective and objective data from various sources for respiratory diseases. The high engagement level observed with passively collected data suggests the potential of wearables for long-term, user-friendly remote monitoring in respiratory disease management. The unique piloting of certain features such as protocol holidays, alert notifications for missing data, and flexible support from the study team provides a reference for future studies in this field.

Several POCT systems comprising microdevices integrated with portable optical readers have been developed to address this issue. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, effective POCT strategies for COVID-19 based on optical detection methods have been established. They can be categorized into fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and wearable sensing. We introduced next-generation pandemic sensing methods incorporating artificial intelligence that can be used to meet global health needs in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities. Factors, such as HIV-related stigma, may deter people from accessing HIV treatment. First-line recommended treatments for neurological infections are not available in many LMICs, leading to inadequate treatment and exposure to agents with more harmful side effect profiles. Access-related factors, such as lack of transportation, lack of health insurance, and inadequate telehealth access, may increase the risk of HIV-related neurological complications. Further research is needed to increase awareness of neurological complications among providers and PWH, and regional guidelines should be considered to better address these complications.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 314, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological infections", "locations": [{"offset": 328, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 480, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 580, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological infections", "locations": [{"offset": 655, "length": 23}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999827, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D009422"], "journal": "Curr HIV/AIDS Rep", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Jia DT", "Carcamo PM", "Diaz MM"]}

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether imaging of complicated upper airway infection in children increased during the winter season of 2022/2023. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study setting, pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans for evaluation of upper respiratory tract infection performed between October 2022 and April 2023 were analyzed regarding presence of the following complications: mastoiditis, abscess, phlegmon, meningitis, reactive vasculitis, and sinus vein thrombosis. Pathogen detection, surgery, and infection parameters were obtained. Data were compared with MRI and CT scans performed in the same months of the preceding five years, distinguishing between pandemic and pre-pandemic years. RESULTS: During the 2022/2023 winter season, the number of MRI and CT scans in children with upper airway infections, the complication rate, the rate of detected streptococcal infections, and the rate of surgery increased significantly compared to expectations based on the five prior winter seasons (all P<0.05). During the first complete pandemic winter season in Europe (2020/2021), the number of MRI and CT scans in children with upper airway infection, the complication rate, and the rates of streptococcal detection and surgery decreased significantly compared to expectations based on the pre-pandemic, the second pandemic, and the post-pandemic winter seasons (all P<0.05).

Currently, the incidence of AKI and progression to kidney replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients with vv-ECMO for severe COVID-19 and implications on outcome are still unclear. METHODS: Retrospective analysis at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany) between March 1st, 2020 and July 31st, 2021. Demographics, clinical parameters, AKI, type of organ support, length of ICU stay, mortality and severity scores were assessed. RESULTS: Ninety-one critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 requiring ECMO were included. The median age of the study population was 57 (IQR 49-64) years and 67% (n = 61) were male. The median SAPS II and SOFA Score on admission were 40 (34-46) and 12 (10-14) points, respectively. We observed that 45% (n = 41) developed early-AKI, 38% (n = 35) late-AKI and 16% (n = 15) no AKI during the ICU stay. Overall, 70% (n = 64) of patients required RRT during the ICU stay, 93% with early-AKI and 74% with late-AKI. Risk factors for early-AKI were younger age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.99, p = 0.02) and SAPS II (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19, p < 0.001). Patients with and without RRT were comparable regarding baseline characteristics. SAPS II (41 vs. 37 points, p < 0.05) and SOFA score (13 vs. 12 points, p < 0.05) on admission were significantly higher in patients receiving RRT. The median duration of ICU (36 vs. 28 days, p = 0.27) stay was longer in patients with RRT. An ICU mortality rate in patients with RRT in 69% (n = 44) and in patients without RRT of 56% (n = 27) was observed (p = 0.23). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS requiring vv-ECMO are at high risk of early acute kidney injury. Early-AKI is associated with age and severity of illness, and presents with high need for RRT.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study and time series data. SETTING: Families participating in the WIC program in the Los Angeles metropolitan area from November 2019 to June 2023. PARTICIPANTS: Families with infants (aged 0-12 months) issued infant formula by WIC with a completed 2020 Los Angeles County WIC Survey (n = 1,897) or issued infant formula by a large WIC program in Southern California between November 2019 and June 2023 (n = 109,135). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of >= 30% reduction in infant formula redemption and interval-scaled infant formula redemption. ANALYSIS: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children formula redemption data were matched to 2020 Los Angeles County WIC Survey data to determine if self-reported difficulty accessing infant formula was associated with administrative infant formula redemption data using negative binomial regression and were used to quantify the prevalence and severity of incomplete formula redemption during 2020-2023 formula shortages using ordinal logistic regression (outcome: interval-scaled formula redemption). RESULTS: Few (13.0%) caregivers reported difficulty accessing the WIC-issued formula early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2.8% who reported an unresolved shortage early in the COVID-19 pandemic had 201% higher rates of >= 30% declines in formula redemption (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-5.79, P < 0.001) than those with no difficulties. Incomplete formula redemption odds were significantly elevated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to January 2022 and increased further during the 2022-2023 infant formula shortages from February 2022 to June 2023, reaching 342% higher in October 2022 than February 2020 (odds ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 4.14-4.72; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children redemption data are an adequate proxy for population-level infant formula access issues among households with low income but are insufficiently sensitive for screening at a household level. US formula shortages (2020-2023) demonstrate the need for improved coordination between nutrition assistance programs, regulatory bodies, and commercial food systems, particularly during acute supply crises.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Women", "locations": [{"offset": 241, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Infants", "locations": [{"offset": 248, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 261, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 304, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 330, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 356, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 760, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "infants", "locations": [{"offset": 788, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Women", "locations": [{"offset": 1212, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Infants", "locations": [{"offset": 1219, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 1232, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1789, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1866, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2140, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Women", "locations": [{"offset": 2487, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Infants", "locations": [{"offset": 2494, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 2507, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999698, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Nutr Educ Behav", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Anderson CE", "Whaley SE"]}

For this purpose, the commonly used antigen, receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike S1 protein (S1RBD), was produced using the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). In the current study, the expression of S1RBD was monitored using Western blot under different culture conditions. Different parameters were studied: the multiplicity of infection (MOI), cell density at infection, and harvest time. Hence, optimal conditions for efficient S1RBD production were identified: MOI 3; cell density at infection 2-3 x 106 cells/mL; and time post-infection (tPI or harvest time) of 72 h and 72-96 h, successively, for expression in shake flasks and a 7L bioreactor. A high production yield of S1RBD varying between 4 mg and 70 mg per liter of crude cell culture supernatant was achieved, respectively, in the shake flasks and 7L bioreactor.

Consequently, the demand for hand sanitizers has experienced a substantial surge. Since the beginning of 2020, the utilization of alcohol-free hand sanitizers has been increasingly favored due to the potential risks associated with alcohol poisoning, flammability, as well as the adverse effects on skin lipid dissolution, dehydration, and sebum reduction, which can lead to severe cases of eczema and norovirus infections. In this study, we developed an aqueous hand sanitizer that does not contain alcohol. The sanitizer consists of naturally occurring, food-grade organic acids, including lactic, citric, and azelaic acids. Additionally, food-grade ammonium sulfate and a small amount of povidone-iodine (PVPI) were included in the formulation to create a synergistic and potent antibacterial effect. The effectiveness of the hand sanitizer was evaluated against four common foodborne pathogens, namely Clostridium botulinum, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, via in vitro testing. The organic acids exhibited a synergistic inhibitory function, resulting in a 3-log reduction in CFU/mL. Furthermore, the presence of povidone-iodine and ammonium sulfate enhanced their antibacterial effect, leading to a 4-log reduction in CFU/mL. The hand sanitizer solution remained stable even after 60 days of storage. During this period, the detection of additional triiodide (I3-) ions occurred, which have the ability to release broad-spectrum molecular iodine upon penetrating the cell walls. This alcohol-free hand sanitizer may offer extended protection and is anticipated to be gentle on the skin. This is attributed to the presence of citric and lactic acids, which possess cosmetic properties that soften and smoothen the skin, along with antioxidant properties.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 148, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000431", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "alcohol", "locations": [{"offset": 418, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011041", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "alcohol poisoning", "locations": [{"offset": 520, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003681", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "dehydration", "locations": [{"offset": 611, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004485", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "eczema", "locations": [{"offset": 679, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 700, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000431", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "alcohol", "locations": [{"offset": 788, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019343", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "citric", "locations": [{"offset": 888, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C010038", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "azelaic acids", "locations": [{"offset": 900, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000645", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "ammonium sulfate", "locations": [{"offset": 940, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011206", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "povidone-iodine", "locations": [{"offset": 979, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "PVPI", "locations": [{"offset": 996, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "1491", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Clostridium botulinum", "locations": [{"offset": 1194, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "562", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Escherichia coli", "locations": [{"offset": 1217, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "1639", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Listeria monocytogenes", "locations": [{"offset": 1235, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "1280", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Staphylococcus aureus", "locations": [{"offset": 1263, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011206", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "povidone-iodine", "locations": [{"offset": 1442, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000645", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "ammonium sulfate", "locations": [{"offset": 1462, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C509722", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "triiodide", "locations": [{"offset": 1679, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007455", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "iodine", "locations": [{"offset": 1769, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000431", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "alcohol", "locations": [{"offset": 1814, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019343", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "citric", "locations": [{"offset": 1955, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019344", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "lactic acids", "locations": [{"offset": 1966, "length": 12}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999590, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:D011206", "chemical@MESH:D019344", "chemical@MESH:D007455", "species@1639", "chemical@MESH:D000431", "chemical@MESH:C509722", "species@1280", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D004485", "species@1491", "species@562", "chemical@MESH:C010038", "disease@MESH:D011041", "chemical@MESH:D019343", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003681", "chemical@MESH:D000645"], "journal": "Toxics", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Bayer G", "Shayganpour A", "Bayer IS"]}

The emergence of new viruses and heightened viral resistance underscores the urgency to explore novel pharmacological reservoirs. Thus, marine organisms, notably soft corals and their symbionts, have drawn substantial attention. In this study, the chemical composition of four Mauritian soft corals: Sinularia polydactya, Cespitularia simplex, Lobophytum patulum, and Lobophytum crassum was investigated using LC-MS techniques. Concurrently, Illumina 16S metagenomic sequencing was used to identify the associated bacterial communities in the named soft corals. The presence of unique biologically important compounds and vast microbial communities found therein was further followed up to assess their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and HPV pseudovirus infection. Strikingly, among the studied soft corals, L. patulum displayed an expansive repertoire of unique metabolites alongside a heightened bacterial consort. Moreover, L. patulum extracts exerted some promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and HPV pseudovirus infection, and our findings suggest that L. patulum may have the potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the prevention of infectious diseases, thereby warranting further investigation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "40677", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Soft corals", "locations": [{"offset": 90, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "40677", "type": "Species"}, "text": "soft corals", "locations": [{"offset": 616, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "40677", "type": "Species"}, "text": "soft corals", "locations": [{"offset": 741, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "Sinularia polydactya", "locations": [{"offset": 754, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "1572427", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Cespitularia simplex", "locations": [{"offset": 776, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "358782", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Lobophytum patulum", "locations": [{"offset": 798, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "328265", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Lobophytum crassum", "locations": [{"offset": 822, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "40677", "type": "Species"}, "text": "soft corals", "locations": [{"offset": 1003, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1183, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1214, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "40677", "type": "Species"}, "text": "soft corals", "locations": [{"offset": 1255, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "358782", "type": "Species"}, "text": "L. patulum", "locations": [{"offset": 1268, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "358782", "type": "Species"}, "text": "L. patulum", "locations": [{"offset": 1387, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1457, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1488, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "358782", "type": "Species"}, "text": "L. patulum", "locations": [{"offset": 1529, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003141", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infectious diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 1616, "length": 19}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999398, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@358782", "species@40677", "species@2697049", "species@328265", "species@1572427", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003141"], "journal": "Mar Drugs", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Jahajeeah D", "Ranghoo-Sanmukhiya M", "Sch&#xe4;fer G"]}

However, they are no longer used as a first-line therapy for hypertension based on Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) outcomes. Later studies have shown that quinazoline-based alpha1-adrenolytics (prazosin, doxazosin) induce apoptosis; however, this effect was independent of alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade and was associated with the presence of quinazoline moiety. Recent studies showed that alpha1-adrenoceptors antagonists may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients due to anti-inflammatory properties. MH-76 (1-[3-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)propyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride)) is a non-quinazoline alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist which, in fructose-fed rats, exerted anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive properties and reduced insulin resistance and visceral adiposity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of fructose consumption and treatment with alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists of different classes (MH-76 and prazosin) on liver tissue of fructose-fed rats. Livers were collected from four groups (Control, Fructose, Fructose + MH-76 and Fructose + Prazosin) and subjected to biochemical and histopathological studies. Both alpha1-adrenolytics reduced macrovesicular steatosis and triglycerides content of liver tissue and improved its antioxidant capacity. Treatment with MH-76, contrary to prazosin, reduced leucocytes infiltration as well as decreased elevated IL-6 and leptin concentrations. Moreover, the MH-76 hepatotoxicity in hepatoma HepG2 cells was less than that of prazosin.

Individuals (n = 133) were dichotomized as having mild or moderate/severe COVID-19 disease based on the WHO ordinal scale. Blood samples were analyzed using the Biocrates platform, providing 630 targeted metabolites for analysis. Resampling techniques and machine learning models were used to determine metabolomic features associated with severe disease. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for functional enrichment analysis. To aid in clinical decision making, we created baseline metabolomics signatures of low-correlated molecules. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to associate these signatures with severe disease on training data. A three-metabolite signature, lysophosphatidylcholine a C17:0, dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:1), and triacylglyceride (20:4_36:4), resulted in the best discrimination performance with an average test AUROC of 0.978 and F1 score of 0.942. Pathways related to amino acids were significantly enriched from the IPA analyses, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5) was differentially activated between groups. In conclusion, metabolites related to lipid metabolism efficiently discriminated between mild vs. moderate/severe disease. SDMA and GABA demonstrated the potential to discriminate between these two groups as well. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5) regulator is differentially activated between groups, suggesting further investigation as a potential therapeutic pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008659", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Metabolic disease", "locations": [{"offset": 142, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 200, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 209, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 430, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 564, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C507406", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "IPA", "locations": [{"offset": 874, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008244", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "lysophosphatidylcholine", "locations": [{"offset": 1181, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C109343", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "dihydroceramide", "locations": [{"offset": 1214, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "triacylglyceride", "locations": [{"offset": 1248, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C507406", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "IPA", "locations": [{"offset": 1454, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "5607", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "115933"}, "text": "mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5", "locations": [{"offset": 1476, "length": 41}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "5607", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "115933"}, "text": "MAP2K5", "locations": [{"offset": 1519, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005680", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "GABA", "locations": [{"offset": 1704, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "5607", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "115933"}, "text": "mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5", "locations": [{"offset": 1790, "length": 41}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "5607", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "115933"}, "text": "MAP2K5", "locations": [{"offset": 1833, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37999202, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:C109343", "chemical@MESH:D005680", "disease@MESH:D008659", "disease@MESH:D007239", "gene@5607", "chemical@MESH:D008244", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "chemical@MESH:C507406"], "journal": "Metabolites", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Yang K", "Kang Z", "Guan W", "Lotfi-Emran S", "Mayer ZJ", "Guerrero CR", "Steffen BT", "Puskarich MA", "Tignanelli CJ", "Lusczek E", "Safo SE"]}

Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of mortality. The sum of weighted integers was used as a total risk score for each patient. Results: In total, 138 medical records of patients were reviewed. Four identified variables based on the odds ratio (age, respiratory rate, glomerular filtration rate and history of stroke) were assigned a weighted integer and were developed to predict mortality risk in hospitalized elderly patients. The AUROC of the scoring system were 0.9415 (95% confidence interval, 0.9033-0.9716).

A random effect model was used to determine the changes in the rate of HAIs during the pandemic. Thirty-seven studies, mostly from the United States (n = 13), were included. Fifteen studies described how the pandemic affected the rate of CLABSIs and CAUTIs, and eight of them showed a significant increase in CLABSIs.

However, the overall risk of HAIs was unaffected by the pandemic (pooled OR: 1.00; 95 CI: 0.80-1.24; p = 0.990).

The rational use of antibiotics is a key aspect of the fight against antimicrobial resistance, which makes this study particularly important. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the consumption of antibacterial drugs among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the peak of the 2020 pandemic and compare them with data from 2019 prior to the pandemic. This study collated data on antibacterial drug consumption in a regional hospital in Aktobe, which served a large population of patients during the pandemic.

In Study 1, social limitations, perceived severity and COVID-19 perceived vulnerability were significantly and positively related to fear of COVID-19. Contrary to what we expected, fear of COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of vaccination intention, which was predicted by both response efficacy and self-efficacy.

This study was, moreover, aimed at investigating factors capable of influencing severe depressive symptomatology in the context of socio-demographics, traumatic events, individual vulnerability, and family functioning. METHOD: The sampling method used in this research was non-probability sampling. The survey took place during a Hospital Open Weekend (8-10 October 2021) organized by the National Gender Observatory on Women's Health \"Fondazione Onda\" on the occasion of the World Mental Health Day. RESULTS: A total of 211 women were interviewed (mean age = 35.6, 53% living alone, more than 15% with financial difficulties, 47% exposed to the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake). More than 50% of the sample reported a higher complexity in managing their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to their previous routine, with no statistically significant differences between working women and non-workers, although the latter obtained higher scores for depressive symptomatology and poorer quality of life. Compared to non-caregivers, female caregivers (22.3%) in charge of the care of loved ones affected by physical (10.9%) or psychiatric disabilities (11.4%) complained of a poorer quality of life, especially in general health perception (p = 0.002), physical function (p = 0.011), role limitations related to physical problems (p = 0.017), bodily pain (p = 0.015), mental health (p = 0.004), and social functioning (p = 0.007). Women caring for people affected by mental disorders seemed to experience a more significant worsening in vitality (p = 0.003) and social functioning (p = 0.005). Approximately 20% of the total sample reported severe depressive symptomatology. Previous access to mental health services (O.R. 10.923; p = 0.000), a low level of education (O.R. 5.410; p = 0.021), and difficulties in management of everyday lives during the COVID-19 pandemic (O.R. 3.598; p = 0.045) were found to be the main variables predictive of severe depressive psychopathology. Old age, good problem-solving skills, and ability to pursue personal goals were identified as protective factors.

Furthermore, resilience was investigated as a potential barrier to help-seeking behavior. METHODS: Data were collected between April and May 2022 from N = 5510 students from Saxony, Germany. To compare dependent variables, subgroups were computed according to students' mental health status. Variables were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons between groups. Multiple regression models were used to investigate the influence of resilience on help-seeking behavior. RESULTS: Between 34 and 38% (depending on the subgroup) of participants indicated that they were not aware of their universities' psychosocial counseling services. Furthermore, between 17 and 19% of participants indicated that they were not willing to seek help from professional mental health services. Finally, the previously found negative effect of resilience on help-seeking behavior was confirmed. CONCLUSION: The results showed a lack of awareness regarding universities' mental health services and a treatment gap among university students.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between inflammation and disease outcomes in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients with VTE. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study, including quantitative and qualitative data collected from COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Infectious Diseases Unit (IDU) of the University Hospital of Ioannina, from 1 March 2020 to 31 May 2022. Venous thromboembolism was defined as a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or vascular tree-in-bud in the lungs. The burden of disease, assessed by computed tomography of the lungs (CTBoD), was quantified as the percentage (%) of the affected lung parenchyma. The study outcomes were defined as death, intubation, and length of hospital stay (LoS). A chi-squared test and univariate logistic regression analyses were performed in IBM SPSS 28.0. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the final study cohort included 532 patients. VTE was found in 11.2% of the total population. In patients with VTE, we found that lymphocytopenia and a high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were associated with an increased risk of intubation and death, respectively.

Patients with severe COVID-19 scored higher (median 17) than those with moderate disease (median 11, p < 0.01). The score did not differentiate between stages of ARDS as defined by the Berlin criteria (p = 0.1) but could discern ARDS according to the revised ESICM definition (p = 0.002). Non-survivors had higher ultrasound scores than survivors (median 18.5 vs. 14, p = 0.04). The score correlated to the oxygenation index (rho = -0.56, p = 0.03), and changes in the score between examinations correlated to changes in oxygenation (rho = -0.41, p = 0.16). The correlation between the score and interleukin-6 was rho = 0.35 (p < 0.001). The interrater reliability for the score was ICC = 0.87 (p < 0.001).

Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome. There is no specific treatment for rubella, but the disease is preventable by vaccination with an efficacy of over 95%. Vaccination coverage is still below the recommended levels and many cases have occurred worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the immunization programs and the quality of disease surveillance worldwide. Operators of the healthcare setting are at increased risk of infection due to their work duties and should receive preventive vaccination or serologic protection to work in a healthcare setting. AIMS: To evaluate the serological evidence of rubella IgG antibodies in female healthcare operators of childbearing age, to assess the risk of a breakthrough infection and the need for an additional dose of vaccine. METHODS: We collected age and antibody titers from 449 young female operators aged <50 years who underwent the periodic surveillance at the Occupational Medicine Unit of the Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, from January to July 2022. Subjects were considered immune if the anti-rubella IgG titer was >11.00 IU/mL. RESULTS: The rate of serologically unprotected subjects was 9.13% (41/449). The mean age of protected subjects was 26.93 years, while the mean age of unprotected subjects was 28.24 years. Age did not correlate with mean titer on statistical analysis (p = 0.10). The acceptance rate among unprotected operators was 31.7%. A positive attitude towards vaccination was found in 11/28 (39.3%) of the unvaccinated subjects, while a negative tendency was found in 2/28 (7.1%) of these subjects; most of the unvaccinated operators 15/28 (53.6%) prefer to postpone the administration of the vaccine. When compared with a similar population from the pre-pandemic period, the actual proportion of immune female subjects was not significantly different from that found in 2019 (90.87% vs. 90.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Protection against rubella was suboptimal among female healthcare workers of childbearing age. Acceptance of the rubella vaccine among these operators was low. Most of those who were hesitant intended to postpone the vaccination, while a minority had negative attitudes toward vaccination. A policy of mandatory vaccination policy should overcome the reluctance of operators.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 91, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001102", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viral infection", "locations": [{"offset": 115, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 157, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 184, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000014", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "birth defects", "locations": [{"offset": 236, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Rubella infection", "locations": [{"offset": 251, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 281, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fetal death", "locations": [{"offset": 297, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009358", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "congenital defects", "locations": [{"offset": 312, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012410", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "congenital rubella syndrome", "locations": [{"offset": 340, "length": 27}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 404, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 592, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 777, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 957, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D059390", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breakthrough infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1056, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 1403, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 2256, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012409", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rubella", "locations": [{"offset": 2350, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37998484, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D000014", "disease@MESH:D005313", "disease@MESH:D001102", "disease@MESH:D059390", "disease@MESH:D012409", "disease@MESH:D009358", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D012410", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Healthcare (Basel)", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Ferrari C", "Somma G", "Gentili S", "Manili G", "Mauro G", "Treglia M", "Trabucco Aurilio M", "Magrini A", "Coppeta L"]}

This study, conducted from 2020 to 2022, aimed to longitudinally assess contraceptive awareness and its correlation with mental well-being in this demographic. A cohort of 210 participants aged 15-25, with a history of wanted or unwanted pregnancy, was studied. The research involved collaborations with Romanian educational institutions and strict adherence to ethical standards. Participants' data on contraceptive knowledge and practices were analyzed, considering factors like substance use and prior sexual education. Mental well-being was evaluated using the SF-36, WHOQOL-BREF, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scales. The study revealed a positive correlation between increased contraceptive knowledge and improved mental health scores. In 2022, 68% of participants displayed proficient contraceptive awareness, up from 52% in 2020. Those with good contraceptive knowledge had an average SF-36 score of 72, indicating a better quality of life, compared to a score of 58 among those with limited knowledge. Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores among individuals with better contraceptive awareness, suggesting reduced anxiety and depression levels. The SF-36 survey results showed significant improvements across the years: the physical score increased from 52.1 (+-6.3) in 2020 to 56.5 (+-6.8) in 2022, the mental score from 51.4 (+-7.2) to 55.0 (+-6.9), and the total score from 53.6 (+-7.9) to 57.5 (+-8.0). WHOQOL-BREF results showed a substantial increase in the social domain score from 53.6 (+-18.2) in 2020 to 63.0 (+-20.5) in 2022. GAD-7 scores declined from 7.9 (+-2.6) in 2020 to 6.5 (+-3.3) in 2022, indicating a decrease in anxiety symptoms. PHQ-9 scores, measuring depression, also showed a downward trend, from 4.8 (+-2.2) in 2020 to 3.9 (+-2.8) in 2022.

The purpose of this study was to systematically identify healthcare cybersecurity ethical concerns experienced during the pandemic to assist with the sustainability of the delivery of care going forward. METHODS: This study was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis protocols for systematic reviews and focused on cybersecurity in healthcare organizations that published articles during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 through October 2022). The articles were accessed using the EBSCOhost and Pub-Med (which queries MEDLINE) platforms, through which the Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE Complete, and Complementary Index databases were accessed. Follow-on supplementary topic modeling allowed for the additional application of ethical principles to the review findings. RESULTS: Among the 22 articles that met the inclusion criteria, three ethical concerns were identified by the rapid review: smart and medical technology concerns (73% of occurrences), at-risk population cybersecurity (55% of occurrences), and legal challenges in data protection (73% of occurrences). The research team also conducted a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis, identifying three topics from the review corpus: robotic and biomedical/clinical care outcomes, diagnostic applications, and public health data usage. These were then mapped to primary ethical healthcare principles.

METHOD: An online retrospective cross-sectional survey of 647 individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccination was conducted. Together with vaccination side effects, socio-demographic characteristics, health status, level of concern about vaccination, and Interoceptive Awareness were collected at the baseline level. Mood, sleep, and Sickness Behavior were assessed at baseline and after vaccination. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics and machine learning techniques. RESULTS: After vaccination, there was a significant increase in Sickness Behavior levels (mean (+-SD) SicknessQ T0 = 1.57 (+-2.72), mean (+-SD) SicknessQ T1 = 5.54 (+-5.51); p-value = 0.001; ES = 0.77). A Machine Learning analysis revealed specific patterns of individual dispositions (sex and age), baseline emotional characteristics (levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and concern about adverse reactions), as well as some components of Interoceptive Awareness (Noticing, Body Listening, and Attention Regulation), as predictors of high levels of Sickness Behavior, both in terms of overall scores (JRIP: 72.65% accuracy, AUC = 0.692, d = 0.709; F1 = 0.726) and individual items (JRIP: 75.77% accuracy, AUC = 0.694; d = 0.717; F1 = 0.754).

Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 elderly residents of Wuhan, aged 65 to 85, who experienced mandatory isolation throughout the pandemic. The interviews centered around three stages of experiences: the Early Lockdown stage (the first week of lockdown after the government implemented the lockdown policy in January 2020), Infection During Lockdown stage (from February to April 2020 when participants were affected by the lockdown), and the Post-Lockdown stage (after April 2020 when the government lifted the lockdown policy). We found that older adults experienced different core themes during each lockdown stage. In the Early Lockdown stage, they felt nervousness and fear while searching for information. During the Lockdown and Infection Stage, they relied on reciprocal support and adjusted to new lifestyles. In the Post-Lockdown stage, they expressed cautions, trust, and gratitude.

Survey data were collected from 287 nurses who were involved in the closed-loop management in Shanghai hospitals from March to June 2022.

Nurses who applied the egalitarian strategy had less psychological distress and relationship tension and better performance than those who applied the neo-traditional strategy and performed most of the childcare. The \"husband does it all\" strategy and the outsourcing strategies seem to have double-edged effects, with better job performance and family relations but also more distress and fewer sleeping hours among nurses.

Nineteen articles were identified; fifteen concerned almost exclusively the first pandemic year. Hospitals accounted for most data. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of presentation of absenteeism data. Before COVID-19 vaccines became available, COVID-19 was a major driver of HCP absenteeism with excess costs, while the mean duration of absenteeism ranged from 5.82 to 33 days per episode of absence. Determinant factors of absenteeism rates were department of employment, high-risk exposure, age, profession, and work experience of HCP, suspected COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 testing, SARS-CoV-2 positivity, and return-to-work strategy. Two studies demonstrated that COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the burden of absenteeism. Routine testing of asymptomatic HCP and use of personal protective equipment also significantly ameliorated absenteeism. In conclusion, COVID-19 has been a major driver of HCP absenteeism. Research is needed to assess how COVID-19 will impact HCP in the next years, considering the new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and the newer COVID-19 vaccines.

The constraints imposed by the pandemic breached regulatory, psychological, and organizational obstructions among both patients and caretakers. Community and hospital nursing services were forced to deal with a new reality, to provide remote care solutions for bedridden chronic patients, as the need for this grew exponentially. Despite the increase of telemedicine in recent years, so far no research in Israel has investigated the nursing staff's perceptions of the quality of the care provided through telenursing. OBJECTIVE: To assess nurses' perceptions of the quality of the care provided through telenursing compared to face-to-face nursing. METHOD: A quantitative cross-sectional study among 227 male and female nurses in Israel. The questionnaire included demographic questions, and the five measures of quality of care: concern and empathy for the patient, professional treatment, response to treatment, educated use of resources, and patients' sense of security. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between nurses' perceptions of telenursing and face-to-face nursing. The quality of face-to-face nursing was perceived as more positive than that of telenursing, in general, as were the individual measures of care quality such as providing professional treatment, response to treatment, and patients' sense of security. CONCLUSIONS: Although telemedicine has increased significantly in recent years, nursing staff still perceived the quality of care and follow-up of face-to-face nursing as more positive. It is important to continue to monitor nurses' perceptions and attitudes towards the strengths of these two treatment methods, not only in crisis situations, but among wider populations, and to investigate the factors that could influence these perceptions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 96, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 376, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 536, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1116, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1203, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1567, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37998408, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Healthcare (Basel)", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Grinberg K", "Sela Y"]}

Even though COVID-19 is a primary respiratory disease, its causative agent, the so-called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is also endowed with high neuro-invasive potential (Neurocovid). The neurological complications of COVID-19, resulting from the direct viral entry into the Central Nervous System (CNS) and/or indirect systemic inflammation and dysregulated activation of immune response, encompass memory decline and anosmia which are typically associated with AD symptomatology. In addition, patients diagnosed with AD are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are inclined to more severe clinical outcomes. In the present review, we better elucidate the intimate connection between COVID-19 and AD by summarizing the involved risk factors/targets and the underlying biological mechanisms shared by these two disorders with a particular focus on the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, APOlipoprotein E (APOE), aging, neuroinflammation and cellular pathways associated with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)/Amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau neuropathologies. Finally, the involvement of ophthalmological manifestations, including vitreo-retinal abnormalities and visual deficits, in both COVID-19 and AD are also discussed.

Severe symptoms in COVID-19 patients are often accompanied by cytokine release syndrome. Here, we analyzed publicly available data from the Yale IMPACT cohort to address immunological misfiring and sex differences in early COVID-19 patients. In 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was considered far more pathogenic and lethal than other circulating respiratory viruses, and the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients in IMPACT cohorts confounds many findings. We ascertained the impact of several important biological variables such as days from symptom onset (DFSO); pre-existing risk factors, including obesity; and early COVID-19 treatments on significantly changed immunological measures in ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients that survived versus those that did not. Deceased patients had 19 unique measures that were not shared with ICU patients including increased granzyme-B-producing GzB+CD8+ T cells and interferon-gamma. Male COVID-19 patients in ICU experienced many more changes in immunological and clinical measures than female ICU patients (25% vs. ~16%, respectively). A total of 13/124 measures including CCL5, CCL17, IL-18, IFNalpha2, Fractalkine, classical monocytes, T cells, and CD4Temra exhibited significant sex differences in female vs. male COVID-19 patients. A total of nine measures including IL-21, CCL5, and CD4Temra differed significantly between female and male healthy controls. Immunosuppressed patients experienced the most decreases in CD4Temra and CD8Tem cell numbers. None of the early COVID-19 treatments were effective in reducing levels of IL-6, a major component of the cytokine storm. Obesity (BMI >30) was the most impactful risk factor for COVID-19-related deaths and worst clinical outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic changed service provision, notably with accelerated digitalisation. Although the service became more accessible, the digitalisation of services impacted the relational experiences for young people. Nevertheless, online provision was described as a 'steppingstone', allowing young people to engage in online therapy or group programmes before transferring to in-person provision.

Over the study period, 50,432 individuals within the catchment area of the outpatient COVID-19 clinic tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR, with 547 patients subsequently referred to a specialized Post-COVID Clinic, and 447 of them enrolled in the study.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study's data were derived from the longitudinal project conducted at Uppsala University Hospital. The mean absenteeism costs due to COVID-19 were calculated using the human capital approach, and a Poisson regression analysis was employed to determine predictors of these costs. RESULTS: The findings showed that the average absenteeism cost due to COVID-19 was USD 1907.1, compared to USD 919.4 before the pandemic (p < 0.001). Notably, the average absenteeism cost for females was significantly higher due to COVID-19 compared to before the pandemic (USD 1973.5 vs. USD 756.3, p = 0.001). Patients who had not fully recovered at the 12-month follow-up exhibited significantly higher costs than those without symptoms at that point (USD 3389.7 vs. USD 546.7, p < 0.001). The Poisson regression revealed that several socioeconomic factors, including age, marital status, country of birth, educational level, smoking status, BMI, and occupation, along with COVID-19-related factors such as severity at onset, pandemic wave, persistent symptoms at the follow-up, and newly introduced treatment for depression after the infection, were significant predictors of the absenteeism costs.

A sample of 225 remote workers filled out anonymous questionnaires measuring techno-stressors, e-work self-efficacy, burnout, and psychological health symptoms (i.e., depressive mood and anxiety symptoms). The data were analyzed using structural equation mediation and moderated mediation models, adopting a parceling technique. The results showed that burnout totally mediated the relationship between techno-stressors and depressive mood, while partially mediating the association between techno-stressors and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, e-work self-efficacy buffered the positive effects of techno-stressors on depressive mood and anxiety symptoms through burnout. The present research attested to the relevance of techno-stressors for the psychological health of remote workers and supported burnout as a mediator of this process, although anxiety symptoms were also directly related to techno-stressors. Moreover, the protective role of domain-specific self-efficacy was confirmed in the realm of remote working. Limitations and practical implications are discussed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 155, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depressive mood", "locations": [{"offset": 808, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 828, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depressive mood", "locations": [{"offset": 1065, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1153, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depressive mood", "locations": [{"offset": 1255, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1275, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1485, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37998281, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D000079225", "disease@MESH:D001007", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D000275"], "journal": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Consiglio C", "Massa N", "Sommovigo V", "Fusco L"]}

Our sample comprised 517 people residing in three Canadian provinces. Respondents completed the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire Short Form, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a short sociodemographic profile. Our findings replicate the original AAQ-SF structure for physical change, psychosocial loss, and psychological growth, with a promising internal consistency range for the third subscale.

However, the impact of masks on the ability to perform vigorous exercise remains an area of concern. Primarily, this impact has been explored in healthy subjects, yielding contradictory findings, and little is known of it among COVID-19-infected individuals. This study examined the effects of surgical masks, N-95 masks, and unmasked conditions on the performance and perceived exertion (RPE) of infected vs. non-infected young women during high-intensity, repeated sprint exercise (5mSRT). Following a familiarization session, eighty-three (42 COVID-19-previously infected (PIG) and 43 non-infected (NIG)), female participants (age 20.02 +- 1.05 years, BMI 21.07 +- 2.1 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to one of three mask conditions: unmasked, surgical mask, or N95 mask. All participants attended three test sessions (i.e., one session for each mask condition) at least one week apart. At the beginning of each test session, data related to participants' physical activity (PA) and sleep behaviours during the previous week were collected. In each test session, participants performed the 5mSRT, during which performance indicators (best distance (BD), total distance (TD), fatigue index (FI) and percentage decrement (PD)) were collected, along with RPE. ANOVA indicated no significant main effects of Groups and Masks, and no significant interaction for Groups x Masks for BD, FI, PD, RPE and most sleep and PA behaviours (p > 0.05). For TD, the Groups x Mask interaction was significant (p = 0.031 and np2 = 0.042). Posthoc analysis revealed, in the unmasked condition, there was no difference in TD between PIG and NIG (p > 0.05). However, when wearing a surgical mask, PIG covered lower TD compared to NIG (p < 0.05). Additionally, different types of masks did not affect TD in NIG, while PIG performed the worst using the surgical mask (p < 0.05). These results suggest post-COVID-19 individuals can maintain physical fitness through regular exercise (i.e., sport science curricula) in unmasked conditions, but not when wearing a surgical mask.

The Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5, the 8-item \"Cynical Distrust\" scale, and the Medical Mistrust Multiformat Scale were used. For vaccination hesitancy, two questions with a 5-point scale were used: one question examining hesitancy to get vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine, and another question examining hesitancy to get vaccinated with the influenza vaccine. In total, 387 nurses (66 men and 321 women) participated in this study. Nurses showed statistically greater hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine compared to hesitancy toward the influenza vaccine. The variation in vaccine hesitancy was explained by the scores in the Medical Mistrust Multiformat Scale, the Dimensions of Anger Reactions, and the Cynical Distrust Scale. The Medical Mistrust Multiformat Scale mediated the relationship between the Cynical Distrust Scale and total vaccine hesitancy. The Dimensions of Anger Reactions Scale significantly moderated the indirect effect of the Cynical Distrust Scale on total vaccine hesitancy through the Medical Mistrust Multiformat Scale.

Main causes that contribute to this phenomenon are uremic milieu and older age. However, there are no data on the impact of body composition parameters to humoral response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used data from adult patients on maintenance hemodialysis who received vaccination with 2 doses of BNT162b2. Quantitative determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain was performed using the Elecsys immunoassay. Antibody levels higher than 0.8 and 264 U/mL were considered positive and protective, respectively. Body composition parameters were assessed using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Overall, 49 patients were included in the study. Three weeks after the 1st vaccination, 34% of patients, and 3 weeks and 3 months after the 2nd vaccination, 100% of patients had detectable titers. Protective titer was developed in 43% of patients 3 weeks after the 2nd vaccination and then decreased to 24% 3 months after the 2nd vaccination. More years on dialysis were correlated to the absence of protective titers. Higher prediction marker values correlated to poor antibody response, and phase angle was negatively associated with the development of protective titers.

This sudden change made them face ethical dilemmas that challenged their values and ethical competence. RESEARCH AIM: This study aimed to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the ethical dilemmas healthcare teachers faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was an inductive qualitative study using a hermeneutic approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Healthcare teachers (n = 20) from eight universities and universities of applied sciences in the Nordic and Baltic countries participated. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was based on the research ethics of the Norwegian National Research Ethics Committee for Medicine and Health Sciences and approved by the Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research. FINDINGS: Healthcare teachers faced several ethical dilemmas due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed three main themes: How should I deal with students' ill-being, and what can I as a teacher do?; What can I demand from myself and my students, what is good teaching?; How do I manage the heavy workload and everyone's needs, and who gets my time? CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of healthcare teachers' continuous need for pedagogic and didactic education, especially considering new technology and ethical issues. During the pandemic, the ethical consequences of remote teaching became evident. Ethical values and ethical dilemmas should be addressed in healthcare education programmes at different levels, especially in teacher education programmes. In the coming years, remote teaching will grow. Therefore, we need more research on this issue from an ethical perspective on its possible consequences for students and healthcare teachers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 182, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 493, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 668, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1171, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37997900, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Nurs Ethics", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Koskinen M", "Hilli Y", "Keskitalo T", "Talvik M", "Sandvik AH", "Thorkildsen KM", "Skyvell-Nilsson M", "Koivula M", "&#x160;teinmiller J"]}

In this study, machine learning was applied for predicting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease binding of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to assist in the identification of potential repurposing candidates for COVID-19 treatment. Ligands bound to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in the Protein Data Bank and compounds experimentally tested in SARS-CoV-2 main protease binding assays in the literature were curated. These chemicals were divided into training (516 chemicals) and testing (360 chemicals) data sets. To identify SARS-CoV-2 main protease binders as potential candidates for repurposing to treat COVID-19, 1188 FDA-approved drugs from the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base were obtained. A random forest algorithm was used for constructing predictive models based on molecular descriptors calculated using Mold2 software. Model performance was evaluated using 100 iterations of fivefold cross-validations which resulted in 78.8% balanced accuracy. The random forest model that was constructed from the whole training dataset was used to predict SARS-CoV-2 main protease binding on the testing set and the FDA-approved drugs. Model applicability domain and prediction confidence on drugs predicted as the main protease binders discovered 10 FDA-approved drugs as potential candidates for repurposing to treat COVID-19.

Magnetic resonance imaging studies have found greater olfactory cleft opacification and higher olfactory bulb volume in post-COVID-19 OD. Olfactory training remains the mainstay of treatment, while platelet-rich plasma injections and ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin combination oral supplementation have shown early promise.Consensus statements on paranasal sinus fungal balls and acute invasive fungal sinusitis have been released.Studies on the nasal microbiome have reported Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium as the most abundant genera, with higher levels of Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium being found in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and healthy individuals respectively. However, there is conflicting evidence on the significance of biodiversity of the nasal microbiome found in CRS versus healthy patients. SUMMARY: While the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic is behind us, its sequelae continue to pose treatment challenges. Further studies in OD have implications in managing the condition, beyond those afflicted post-COVID-19 infection. Similarly, more research is needed in studying the nasal microbiome and its implications in the development and treatment of CRS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bacterial infections", "locations": [{"offset": 154, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 265, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 291, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000857", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "olfactory dysfunction", "locations": [{"offset": 312, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 486, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C005958", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "palmitoylethanolamide", "locations": [{"offset": 611, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D047311", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "luteolin", "locations": [{"offset": 637, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012852", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "invasive fungal sinusitis", "locations": [{"offset": 767, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 994, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002908", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "chronic rhinosinusitis", "locations": [{"offset": 1008, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1202, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1243, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1422, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1431, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37997887, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D002908", "chemical@MESH:C005958", "disease@MESH:D000857", "disease@MESH:D001424", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003141", "chemical@MESH:D047311", "disease@MESH:D012852", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Png LH", "Ng DHL", "Teo NWY"]}

RESULTS: The data resulted in five classes by the Descending Hierarchical Classification (DHC), which made up two categories: \"Practices developed by nurses for continuity of care in the hospital environment\" and \"Continuity of care during discharge to the home\". The strategies used by the nurses were: daily care systematized in the nursing process and guidance both for preparation and for the day of discharge.

The Care Transitions Measure (CTM-15) and question guide about symptoms, difficulties and use of health services after discharge were used. Student's t-test, Pearson and Spearman correlation were used. RESULTS: The mean score for care transition quality was 74.2 (+-18.2). Factors associated with higher quality were receiving care in intensive care (p = 0.001), using non-invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.05), using vasopressors (p = 0.027) and having an appointment at the hospital after discharge (p = 0.014). Positive correlated factors were length of stay (p = 0.017), and negative factors were post-discharge symptoms of fatigue (p = 0.001), weakness (p = 0.008), difficulty doing moderate activities (p = 0.003) and how difficult recovery is (p = 0.003).

METHODS: Randomized clinical trial that included two parallel groups of acute coronary syndrome patients who performed a cardiac rehabilitation program that consisted of moderate physical exercise intervals along with learning healthy habits in a municipal sports center (experimental group) and in a tertiary hospital (control group) between September 2019 and June 2020. We collected the following data: compliance, anthropometrical, clinical, psychological variables, diet and tobacco habits, strength and functional capacity from ergospirometry. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the cardiac rehabilitation program (experimental group=12, control group=10). Significant improvement was observed for cholesterol, the sit-and-stand test, cardiac frequency in VT1 and VT2, and watts in VT1 in the control group, and for HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, the sit-and-stand test, and frequency, and watts in VT1 in the experimental group. Better achievement was found in the control group for cardiac frequency in VT2 (11.17 vs 2.88 bpm) and in EG for HDL-cholesterol (11.0 vs 0.63 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS: We are unable to determine the effectiveness of the out-of-hospital cardiac rehabilitation program due to a lack of power (high number of withdrawals caused by COVID-19 lockdown).

Due to lack of adequate non-invasive ventilatory support during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, we aimed to evaluate whether bCPAP was safe and feasible when adapted for use in adults with similar indications. Methods: Adults (18-64 years) with severe pneumonia and moderate hypoxaemia (80 to <90% oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air) were provided bCPAP via nasal cannula at a flow rate of 10 litres per minute (l/min) oxygen at 10 centimetres (cm) H2O pressure, in two tertiary hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Qualitative interviews and focus group discussions, using a descriptive phenomenological approach, were performed with patients and staff (n = 39) prior to and after the introduction (n = 12 and n = 27 respectively) to understand the operational challenges to the introduction of bCPAP. Results: We enrolled 30 adults (median age 52, interquartile range (IQR) 40-60 years) with severe pneumonia and hypoxaemia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) irrespective of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test results to receive bCPAP. At baseline mean SpO2 on room air was 87% (+-2) which increased to 98% (+-2), after initiation of bCPAP. The mean duration of bCPAP oxygen therapy was 14.4 +- 24.8 hours. There were no adverse events of note, and no treatment failure or deaths. Operational challenges to the clinical introduction of bCPAP were lack of functioning pulse oximeters, difficult nasal interface fixation among those wearing nose pin, occasional auto bubbling or lack of bubbling in water-filled plastic bottle, lack of holder for water-filled plastic bottle, rapid turnover of trained clinicians at the hospitals, and limited routine care of patients by hospital clinicians particularly after official hours. Discussion: If the tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh are supplied with well-functioning good quality pulse oximeters and enhanced training of the doctors and nurses on proper use of adapted version of bCPAP, in treating adults with severe pneumonia and hypoxaemia with or without ARDS, the bCPAP was found to be safe, well tolerated and not associated with treatment failure across all study participants. These observations increase the confidence level of the investigators to consider a future efficacy trial of adaptive bCPAP oxygen therapy compared to WHO standard low flow oxygen therapy in such patients. Conclusion: s Although bCPAP oxygen therapy was found to be safe and feasible in this pilot study, several challenges were identified that need to be taken into account when planning a definitive

Frailty is extremely common among dialysis patients and may contribute to the impaired immunogenicity. This study aimed to determine the association between frailty and humoral immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Adult hemodialysis patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a priming dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, were assessed for eligibility. Participants were categorized as robust, pre-frail, or frail using the Fried frailty criteria. Humoral responses were assessed 28 days after vaccination by measuring titers of anti-spike IgG antibodies. The primary outcome was anti-spike antibody seroconversion, defined as antibody levels >=50 AU/mL. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between frailty status and the primary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 206 participants (mean age 67 +- 13 years, 50% women) were included in the study, of whom 50 (24%) were characterized as frail, 86 (42%) were characterized as pre-frail, and 70 (34%) were characterized as robust. Anti-spike antibody levels were progressively lower with more advanced stages of frailty (P <0.001). Compared with robust patients, a significantly smaller proportion of pre-frail and frail patients developed anti-spike antibody seroconversion (87%, 66%, and 40%, respectively; P <0.001).

However, despite its importance, little is known about the protective factors for ASD children during the lockdowns. METHODS: Based on the Shanghai Autism Early Developmental Cohort, 188 ASD children with two visits before and after the strict Omicron lockdown were included; 85 children were lockdown-free, while 52 and 51 children were under the longer and the shorter durations of strict lockdown, respectively. We tested the association of the lockdown group with the clinical improvement and also the modulation effects of parent/family-related factors on this association by linear regression/mixed-effect models. Within the social brain structures, we examined the voxel-wise interaction between the grey matter volume and the identified modulation effects. RESULTS: Compared with the lockdown-free group, the ASD children experienced the longer duration of strict lockdown had less clinical improvement (beta = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.19-0.79], p = 0.001) and this difference was greatest for social cognition (2.62 [0.94-4.30], p = 0.002). We found that this association was modulated by parental agreeableness in a protective way (-0.11 [-0.17 to -0.05], p = 0.002). This protective effect was enhanced in the ASD children with larger grey matter volumes in the brain's mentalizing network, including the temporal pole, the medial superior frontal gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal neuroimaging cohort study identified that the parental agreeableness interacting with the ASD children's social brain development reduced the negative impact on clinical symptoms during the strict lockdown.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 168, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 248, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000067877", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "autism spectrum disorder", "locations": [{"offset": 262, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 380, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001321", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Autism", "locations": [{"offset": 442, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 485, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 573, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 618, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1115, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1532, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1831, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37997447, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D000067877", "disease@MESH:D001321"], "journal": "Psychol Med", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Zhang L", "Ren T", "He H", "Huang L", "Huang R", "Xu Y", "Zhou L", "Tan H", "Chen J", "Wu D", "Yang H", "Zhang H", "Yu J", "Du X", "Dai Y", "Pu Y", "Li C", "Wang X", "Shi S", "Sahakian BJ", "Luo Q", "Li F"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

BACKGROUND: Medical students constitute the future workforce of primary health care services. The relationship between EBM training and their views on conspiracies about COVID-19 is critical to explore for providing a better primary health care. The relationship EBM training and medical students' views on TCAM is also important in this regard. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Turkish medical students were surveyed about EBM training, TCAM, and COVID-19 conspiracies. The electronic survey form consisted of five parts: Demographic characteristics, views and self-perceived knowledge about TCAM and the methods, views on the origin of SARS-COV-2, participation in EBM training, and views on TCAM training. A total of 49 medical schools provided response. Along with descriptive statistics, Chi-square test was utilized. FINDINGS: Among 2577 participants, 24.0% of them believed SARS-COV-2 was artificially designed. The students who have participated in EBM training via both lecture and small group discussions have a less positive view on TCAM than both the students who have not participated in any EBM training (p < 0.05) and the students who participated in only-lectures (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between EBM training and whether believing COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) has been designed purposefully by some people or it has emerged naturally chi2 (1) = 17.21 p < 0.001. The odds of thinking COVID-19 emerged naturally was 1.85 times higher (95% CI: 1.38-2.47) if the students have participated in EBM training via both lectures and small group discussions than if they have not participated in any EBM training.

Moreover, moderating effects of emotion dysregulation and family functioning on this association were investigated. METHODS: This study analyzed data collected in April 2021 from 154 family caregivers (Mage = 38.79, SDage = 9.36, range = 22-64) recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The impact of COVID-19 stressors on family caregiving burden was tested, and moderating impacts of emotion dysregulation and family functioning were also investigated. RESULTS: Both COVID-19 stress exposure and stress appraisal were positively associated with family caregiving burden. Emotion dysregulation and problematic family functioning were also positively associated with family caregiving burden. A significant moderating effect of emotion dysregulation was found, such that family caregivers with higher emotion dysregulation were likely to feel more caregiving burden when they experienced more COVID-19 stressors.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 304 firefighters assigned in Gyeonggi-do. The SAVE-9 scale, initially developed for healthcare workers, was adapted for firefighters. We compared it with the SAVE-6 scale designed for the general population among the firefighters sample. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to explore the factor structure of both scales. Internal consistency reliability was checked using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega. Convergent validity was assessed in accordance with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scales. RESULTS: The SAVE-9 scale demonstrated a Cronbach alpha of 0.880, while the SAVE-6 scale yielded an alpha of 0.874. CFA indicated good model fits for both SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 scales among firefighters sample. The SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 comparably measures viral anxiety of firefighters.

METHODS: Population-based and cross-sectional data from the 2019 and 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Surveys were used. Data of 57,048 and 54,948 adolescents from the 2019 and 2020 surveys, respectively, were compared. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare health behavior, obesity, and mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of overweight, obesity, and body image perceived subjectively as fat, were higher in the 2020 sample compared to the 2019 sample. The aOR of the frequency (more than 3 times a week) of fast-food consumption was higher in 2020 than in 2019. However, the aOR of physical activity, alcohol use, and smoking experience were lower in 2020 than in 2019. In addition, during COVID-19, adolescents were less likely to have perceived severe stress, depressive moods, and suicidal ideation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty post-mucormycotic patients treated with maxillectomy (33 males, 27 females) were divided into 5 groups based on maxillectomy types (unilateral/bilateral, subtotal/total) and treatment given (psychotherapy/obturator/implant/orbital/ocular prosthesis). Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using appearance anxiety inventory (AAI) and patient health questionnaire (PHQ9). Data were collected at 4 time intervals [T0 (before prosthesis), T1 (2 weeks after prosthesis), T2 (6 months) and T3 (1 year). Frequency distribution and mean values were determined for individual group/subgroups/total cohort. Differences between groups were determined using one-way ANOVA (single-factor/Friedman's) followed by post hoc correction (Bonferroni) and t test for unequal variance with probability P value being statistically significant at <0.05. RESULTS The mean scores for appearance anxiety were 29.13+-4.72 (diagnostic for existing body dysmorphic disorder) at T0, which decreased to 16.88+-3.02 at T3 for the total cohort. The differences for the gender-based cohort, its various groups, and respective subgroups were significant (P<0.05) at various time intervals. The mean scores in the total cohort for depression symptom severity were 16.81+-4.89 (moderately severe) at T0, which increased to 18.5+-4.94 at T1, followed by reduction at T2 (12.0+-4.43; moderate) and T3 (7.38+-3.37; mild).

Previous research indicated a negative effect on students' competence development, and it remains unclear whether blended learning concepts could provide compensation. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare pre- to post-pandemic students' performance in standardized baseline (BL) and final exams (FE), as well as the associated knowledge gain (KG) in three consecutive undergraduate blended learning-based oral radiology courses (C1-3). METHODS: Ninety-four students participated during two pre-pandemic semesters (October 17-July 18), and ninety-eight students during two post-pandemic semesters (October 21-July 22). Before the pandemic, conventional face-to-face lectures were combined with an oral radiology platform. Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, additional video-based e-learning modules were adopted from the pandemic online-only curriculum. In each semester, skills and KG were assessed by conducting standardized BL and FE. Students' performance in BL, FE, and the associated KG during pre-pandemic semesters was compared to post-pandemic semesters. RESULTS: In post-pandemic courses, students showed significantly lower BL scores, whereas KG was significantly higher in post- compared to pre-pandemic semesters (27.42% vs. 10.64%, p < 0.001, respectively). FE scores in C1 significantly improved from pre- to post-pandemic semesters. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of our study, the lower BL scores confirmed the negative effect of the pandemic on competence development. Blended learning concepts seem to compensate for this effect and enable students to return to pre-pandemic levels.

We aimed to describe the impact of long COVID on work. METHODS: We co-produced baseline and follow-up online surveys with people with lived experience of long COVID (including three of the co-authors). Respondents were aged 18 years and older with self-reported long COVID following confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection who were not hospitalised in the first 2 weeks of illness. The baseline survey was administered in November, 2020, using convenience non-probability sampling through social media. Following informed consent, participants completed a follow-up survey at 1 year (November, 2021). Ethics approval was granted by the University of Southampton. FINDINGS: Of 2210 invited, 1153 (52%) participants responded to the survey (mean age of 47 7 years [SD 10 6], 965 [84%] female, 1096 [95%] White, and 892 [78%] holding a university degree). 54 participants (4 7%) reported recovery at follow-up. Median duration of illness was 19 8 months (IQR 19 3-20 1) at follow-up. An equal proportion reported being unable to work at baseline (20 4%, n=235) and follow-up (20 6%, n=237). However, a higher proportion reported being made redundant or taking early retirement at follow-up (8 9%, n=102) than at baseline (2 2%, n=25). 209 (18 1%) reported losing or resigning or leaving their job due to long COVID at follow-up compared with 170 (14 8%) participants at baseline. 307 (26 6%) participants reported not taking time off-sick due to long COVID at baseline, decreasing to 122 (10 6%) at follow-up. Of the 656 individuals reporting length of time off-sick, 354 (54%) were off-sick for more than 3 months, with 113 (17 2%) off-sick for more than 12 months. Nearly half (47%, n=538) reported a loss in income. INTERPRETATION: The convenience non-probability sampling limits generalisability. Research is needed in a representative population sample to characterise the effect on working patterns in people with long COVID, particularly in those with less flexible and more physically demanding occupations who may be less able to take time off to recover.

The SMC aimed to provide public health teams with local-data-driven modelling, data analysis, and policy and commissioning advice to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the local population. It also aimed to answer operational questions, since the Government's forecasts were not suitably applicable. METHODS: From March 23, 2020, the SMC met (virtually) every Thursday to monitor COVID-19 situation reports, answer queries related to data and modelling, and provide interpretations of data or reports from many internal and external sources. SMC also provided quantitative information for public health teams to use within their organisations to advise on the local epidemic picture. Among other tools, the SMC calibrated a mathematical model to local COVID-19 data that could forecast health-care and hospital demand and COVID-19-related deaths. FINDINGS: Throughout the pandemic, the SMC provided scientific and data-driven evidence on the necessity of body storage contracts, monetary support for urgent care, and operational adjustments surrounding health-care provisions. The scientific evidence was generated and used repeatedly in each organisation to make beneficial decisions in a time of crisis. Although chasing an ever-changing pandemic picture was challenging, our swift reaction to national policy and pandemic changes allowed us to support policymakers, reduce anxiety, and provide clarity on the next steps. Our collaboration is one among few across the country and thus should be not only celebrated but also replicated, with appropriate resources and funding. INTERPRETATION: Besides mitigating the direct impact of the COVID-19 situation in Sussex, we have established a scientific collaboration relationship, in contrast to a customer-consultant setting, allowing the group to incorporate both the technical and applied perspectives into the work. With a clear structure, ethos and methodology, the SMC is able to step into the gap between academia and public health modelling to consider different impactful questions of operational importance where underlying complicated models exist, such as waiting times or system demand and capacity, and provide data analytic upskilling to public health teams.

In November 2022, severe presentations of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), including empyema, were notified by clinicians across the UK. UKHSA investigated this rise with the aim of informing clinical management and public health response. METHODS: We undertook a case-series analysis using multiple routine data sources, exempted from ethics approval or patient consent. We identified iGAS cases in England in children younger than 15 years with an LRTI reported between Oct 1 and Dec 21, 2022, using UKHSA laboratory surveillance data (GAS detected in LRT specimens) and notifications by clinicians and Health Protection Teams (HPTs). Symptoms, diagnoses, health-care interactions, and outcome (death or recovery) data were obtained from HPT case management notes, the National Child Mortality Database, and the NHS Digital Emergency Care Dataset. FINDINGS: We identified 147 cases of LRTI iGAS in children across England (77 [52%] male, 70 [48%] female; median age 4 years [IQR 2-6]). Predominant ethnicities were White (74 [65%] of 113 with known ethnicity) and Asian (18 [16%] of 113). Most reported symptoms were fever (90 [75%] of 120 children with >=1 symptom) and cough (60 [50%] of 120), and 71 (48%) of all 147 children had a diagnosed respiratory viral coinfection (most commonly hMPV and RSV). 127 (86%) of children attended an emergency department, 31% (n=36/114 with onset date) at least twice within 21 days after symptom onset. 37 (25%) of 147 children died, with a median time from symptom onset to death of 4 days (IQR 3-7). Of 32 children with sample dates, 16 (84%) were tested for GAS on or after the day they died. Over half of deaths (21 [57%] of 37 deaths) occurred in the community after rapid deterioration, of whom 18 had previous contact with health-care services documented. INTERPRETATION: The UK saw an unusual rise in iGAS LRTIs in children in late 2022. One in four cases died, over half in the community. Non-specific symptoms, viral symptoms, or positive virology might have lowered suspicion of bacterial infection. Although the use of multiple available data sources expedited the analysis, varying data completeness limited interpretation. Our study highlights the need for earlier detection and identification of effective measures to prevent death.

Digital inequalities disproportionately affect those most at risk of wider health inequalities (e.g., older age, minority ethnicity, and lower household income) and might intersect with populations with higher cardiometabolic disease risk such as South Asians in the UK. We wanted to understand how those involved in DHI implementation perceive and address these inequalities, to help develop recommendations to reduce the risk of DHI implementation exacerbating existing health inequalities. METHODS: For this qualitative study we used a purposive sampling strategy, whereby focus groups and semi-structured interviews were done online between April 7 and Dec 8, 2022, with stakeholders, including health-care professionals (n=15); technology developers and digital experts (n=10); those in strategy, evaluation, or policy roles (n=15); and charities (n=4). Discussions covered barriers and facilitators to inclusive design and implementation of DHIs, with focus dependent on expertise. Findings from a qualitative study with South Asian patients have been reported separately. Audio recordings were transcribed and coded using reflexive thematic analysis. Participants provided written consent and the study received NHS Health Research Authority approval from London - Brent Research Ethics Committee (IRAS 261047). FINDINGS: Participants had a good understanding of barriers to DHI use for cardiometabolic disease faced by South Asians, highlighting the need to design for language, culture, and diet. Many emphasised the link between digital exclusion and socioeconomic deprivation, across all ethnic groups in the UK. The potential for DHIs in improving patient outcomes was recognised; however, equity concerns included unequal patient access, lack of data and resources to target support, and need for quality evidence to recommend and commission digital tools. A range of solutions for improving equity were suggested such as resourcing support for digital upskilling, community engagement, and the role of regulation in embedding improved design and evaluation of DHIs available through health-care services. INTERPRETATION: This study reflects the experiences of professionals interested in (digital) health inequalities. However, challenges to equitable digital health implementation and use are well described. Our findings present multi-sectoral responsibilities and opportunities for action.

Official figures of NHS waiting lists in England do not account for patients on the hidden waiting list (ie, patients who have symptoms or disease requiring elective procedures who have not been placed on the waiting list due to pandemic-related disruption). The aim of this study was to model the elective procedure backlog in England, including the hidden waiting list. METHODS: We used publicly available activity data from NHS Digital to estimate procedure-level backlogs in England for the pandemic period (from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2022) compared with expected population need for elective procedures based on pre-pandemic trends, adjusting for population growth and ageing, as well as patient deaths while on the waiting list. The primary outcome was the elective procedure backlog. Elective procedures were defined as including surgery, endoscopy, interventional radiology, and interventional cardiology. The secondary outcome was the procedural hidden waiting list. The elective procedure backlog was reported by specialty and procedure. FINDINGS: The total elective procedure backlog in England on Dec 31, 2022, was modelled to be 4 519 467 procedures. The hidden waiting list was 3 621 423, comprising 80 3% of the total backlog. Half the total backlog (2 228 348, 49 3%) was in people aged 16-59 years. The largest backlogs were in general surgery (1 463 423, 32 4%), orthopaedics (1 001 850, 22 2%), and urology (510 649, 11 3%). Overall, 84 7% (3 827 687 procedures) of the backlog were for day-case procedures. The procedures with the greatest total backlog were sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy (546 930, 12 1%), gastroscopy (376 089, 8 3%), cataract surgery (238 912, 5 3%), and lower limb joint replacement (209 976, 4 6%). INTERPRETATION: NHS waiting lists are an unreliable guide to the true population need for elective procedures. Initiatives are needed to identify and prioritise patients requiring urgent treatment. Most need is for low-complexity high-volume day-case surgery. Sustained, ring-fenced funding is required to invest in scaling up the operative workforce and facilities, and to increase the resilience of surgical services to avoid existing backlogs being compounded by future external pressures. This modelling study is based on an assumption that over the course of the pandemic the incidence of surgical disease did not change.

PA behaviours track from childhood into adulthood. The effects of walking interventions on adult health are known; however, the potential of walking to promote PA in adolescents is less known. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a novel, school-based walking intervention aimed at increasing PA levels of adolescent girls. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, female pupils aged 12-14 years were recruited from 18 (mixed or single-sex) schools across the border region of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Schools were randomly assigned to either the control group (usual physical activity; n=9) or the intervention group (n=9) by independent faculty staff using an online randomisation tool (randomization.com). In intervention schools, female pupils aged 15-18 years were trained as walk leaders and led the younger pupils in 10-15 min walks before school, at break, and at lunchtime. Walks were in school grounds and pupils were encouraged to join as many walks as possible. The intervention was delivered for a full school year excluding holidays (for a total of 18-21 weeks). Accelerometers measured PA, and the primary outcome was total PA (counts per minute [cpm]). Ethics approval was granted by Ulster University Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent (parent or guardian) and assent (pupils) was obtained. This study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, 12847782. FINDINGS: The study took place from Sept 1, 2021, to May 31, 2023. In total, 589 pupils were recruited (n=286 in intervention group; n=303 in control group). Median moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) at baseline was 36 1 min/day (IQR 23 0) for the intervention group and 35 3 min/day (19 8) for the control group. Only 37 (15%) girls in the intervention group and 29 (10%) girls in the control group met PA guidelines (60 min/day of MVPA). The mean total PA after intervention was 676 cpm (SD 18 7) for the intervention group and 710 cpm (SD 17 7) for the control group. Post-intervention total PA did not differ between groups when adjusted for age, body-mass index, z-scores, and baseline PA (mean difference -33 5, 95% CI -21 2 to 88 1; p=0 213). INTERPRETATION: Scaling up PA interventions is challenging. Despite a promising feasibility study, the results of this fully powered trial indicate that in this context, the walking programme did not increase PA. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, school environments have changed, and although pupils enjoyed the programme, attendance at walks was low. There is a need to better understand the implementation of interventions such as this within schools.

Previous research suggests that differences in time-use might explain this disparity, as women generally spent more time doing psychologically taxing activities than men. We investigated (1) sex differences in the impact of the pandemic in the long-term trajectories of life satisfaction and (2) whether time-use differences partly explained that differential impact. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we used the 1970 British Cohort Study, a birth cohort representing people born in Great Britain in 1970. Since 1970, information has been collected for all cohort members every 4-10 years (ten sweeps). Additional data were collected at three timepoints during the pandemic (May 2020, September-October 2020, February-March 2021) as part of the COVID-19 Survey. Response rates within the target population ranged between 23 6% (May, 2020) and 32 5% (March, 2021) in the COVID-19 Survey. We used non-response weights to restore sample representativeness to the target population (cohort members alive and residing in the UK during the pandemic). Life satisfaction was prospectively assessed at ages 26 (1996), 30, 34, 42, 46, 50, 50 5, and 51 years (2021) using a single question with responses ranging from 0 (lowest life satisfaction) to 10 (highest life satisfaction). We used multiple-group piecewise latent growth curve models grouped by sex assigned at birth. Additional models were adjusted for self-reported number of hours spent working, volunteering, home-schooling children, taking care of children and other people, and doing housework during the pandemic. Participants provided verbal informed consent. Ethics approval was not sought as non-sensitive, open-access data with minimal risk of identification was used. FINDINGS: We analysed data from 6766 adults (3799 [56 2%] women and 2967 [43 8%] men). Compared with men, women had consistently higher levels of life satisfaction before the pandemic (Deltaintercept,unadjusted = 0 213, 95% CI 0 087 to 0 340, p=0 0009), and experienced a more accelerated decline with its onset (Deltaquad2,unadjusted = -0 018, -0 026 to -0 011; p<0 0001), even after accounting for time use (Deltaquad2,adjusted = -0 016, -0 031 to -0 001; p=0 0348). Results were robust to adjustment for concurrent financial and occupational situation (Deltaquad2,adjustedfull = -0 019, -0 035 to -0 004; p=0 0158). INTERPRETATION: Our study shows sex inequalities in the impact of the pandemic on the long-term life satisfaction trajectories of adults in their 50s. Self-reported time-use differences did not account for these inequalities. One of the limitations is that we relied on self-reported time-use and were not able to include factors like the so-called mental load (being responsible for organising or monitoring activities, regardless of being involved in their execution), which might partly explain these results.

Shielding was characterised by extreme isolation and applied to those with certain illnesses, disabilities, and during pregnancy. For the estimated 1300 high-risk doctors, shielding meant abrupt departure from the clinical environment. We aimed to understand the impact of shielding on junior doctors (JDs) by interviewing them and their consultants. METHODS: This qualitative study used individual semi-structured interviews and reflexive thematic analysis. Virtual interviews were conducted between Sept 2, and Nov 30, 2022, using an interview guide, including open questions around impacts on training, career, and health. 11 JDs and 2 consultants were recruited via Scotland-wide purposive and snowball sampling. Written informed consent was obtained. 12 of 13 participants were women. Eight JDs were shielding because of health issues, and three because of pregnancy. Participant specialties included primary care, secondary care, and foundation and specialty training. Interview transcripts were coded by the lead author and the second author acted as a critical friend. FINDINGS: Despite making important contributions working from home, most JDs (73%, eight of 11) felt that their work was undervalued during shielding. They felt forgotten, feeling they had to \"pester\" supervisors to be allocated work. All participants reported inadequate support at Occupational Health and workplace levels, including limited supervision or information about training impacts. Negative attitudes towards JDs were experienced by 82% (nine of 11) of JDs, including being denied reasonable adjustments and threatened with dismissal if not following shielding advice. Consultants described supervisory challenges including not receiving guidance or resources and ongoing issues supporting disabled and pregnant JDs beyond the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: These findings offer novel qualitative insight into the impacts of shielding on JDs in Scotland. Findings indicated that support infrastructure was not fit for purpose. Given the significant number of JDs that take prolonged leave from the clinical environment, and the JDs working with disabilities and during pregnancy, these findings are of ongoing concern. Although the sample size was small and the study was set in a specific region, these findings suggest there is potential to improve support infrastructure and move towards a more inclusive clinical environment that recognises, celebrates, and benefits from the value of a diverse workforce.

Two exposures were used separately: trade union presence and trade union membership, interacting with a binary variable splitting time periods between before and during the pandemic. Our analytical sample included 49 915 observations from 5988 individuals. 3341 (56%) individuals worked in unionised workplaces. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, UK residence, educational level, financial situation, workplace size, and survey interview date. We then replicated the analyses including a 3-way interaction with industry. All Understanding Society participants gave written informed consent. Ethics approval was not required. FINDINGS: In our sample, approximately 41% were male and 59% were female, and the mean age was 47 2 years (SD 11 4). Comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, we found that the odds of GHQ-12 caseness for those in non-unionised workplaces increased by 45% (odds ratio 1 45, 95% CI 1 17-1 80), whereas in unionised workplaces odds increased by 28% (1 28, 1 05-1 57). When analysis was confined to unionised workplaces, the odds of GHQ-12 caseness for non-union members increased more (1 40, 1 07-1 83) compared with members (1 18, 0 91-1 53); however, with wide CIs. Overall, industry had no modification effect in both exposures. Sensitivity analysis using GHQ-36 as a continuous outcome demonstrated no real change in the patterns of the results. INTERPRETATION: The mental health of workers in unionised workplaces appears to have worsened less than the mental health of those in non-unionised workplaces; however, there is insufficient evidence of effect differential by type of industrial sector. Designing policies that encourage and facilitate trade union presence in workplaces should be promoted, as they are likely to mitigate adverse mental health effects in times of extreme uncertainty.

The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health-care systems, leading to delays in essential medical services, including treatment for cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to examine the impact of the pandemic on delayed cardiovascular care in Europe. METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed and published quantitative studies in English from Nov 1, 2019, to Sept 18, 2022, that addressed pandemic-induced delays in cardiovascular disease care for adult patients in Europe. Data appraisal, extraction, and quality assessment were done by two reviewers using the 14-item QualSyst tool checklist. We extracted summary patient-level data from the studies, including around 3 5 million patients. Evaluated outcomes included changes pre-March 2020 and during the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions, mortality rates, medical help-seeking delays post-symptom onset, treatment initiation delays, and treatment procedure counts. The protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022354443). FINDINGS: Of the 132 included studies (20% from the UK), all were observational retrospective, with 87% focusing on the first wave of the pandemic. Results were categorised into five disease groups: ischaemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, cardiac arrests, heart failures, and others. Hospital admissions showed significant decreases around the ranges of 12-66% for ischaemic heart diseases, 9-40% for cerebrovascular diseases, 9-66% for heart failures, 27-88% for urgent and elective cardiac procedures, and an increase between 11-56% for cardiac arrests. Mortality rates were significantly higher during the pandemic, ranging between 1-25% (vs 16-22% before the pandemic) for ischaemic heart diseases and 8-70% (vs 8-26% before the pandemic) for cerebrovascular diseases. Only one study ranked low in quality. INTERPRETATION: The pandemic led to reduced acute CVD hospital admissions and increased mortality rates. Delays in seeking medical help were observed, while urgent and elective cardiac procedures decreased. Policymakers and health-care systems should work together on implementing adequate resource allocation strategies and clear guidelines on how to handle care during health crises, reducing diagnosis and treatment initiation delays, and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Future studies should evaluate the long-term impact of pandemics on delayed CVD care, and the health-economic impact of COVID-19.

We aimed to examine changes in food and drink purchasing during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: In this interrupted time-series analysis, we used transaction-level purchasing data for food and drink items bought for at-home (n=1245 households) and out-of-home consumption (n=226 individuals) for London and the North of England (Kantar GB). Outcomes included household-level weekly purchased total energy, energy from specific products, alcohol volume, and frequency of out-of-home purchasing occasions. We compared purchases between March 16 and June 11, 2020 (pandemic restrictions, the intervention) and Jan 1, 2019, to March 15, 2020 (counterfactual). The effect of the intervention was modelled using 2-part negative binomial regression models adjusted for time, season, festivals, region, and sociodemographic characteristics. Subgroup analyses explored interactions between the intervention and sociodemographic characteristics and usual purchasing levels. FINDINGS: The marginal mean estimate of total take-home energy purchased was 17 4% (95% CI 14 9-19 9; 6130 kcal) higher during the intervention period than during the counterfactual period. Increases of 35 2% (23 4-47 0; 505 mL) in take-home volume of alcoholic beverages and 1 2% (0 1-2 4; 165 kcal) in foods and drinks high in fat, salt, and sugar were observed. Reductions in purchased energy from ultraprocessed foods (-4 0%, -5 2 to -2 8; -541 kcal), and out-of-home purchasing frequency (-44 0%, -58 3 to -29 6; -0 6 days) were observed. Highest socioeconomic status was associated with largest increases in total purchased energy (increase of 7217 kcal, 95% CI 5450-8985, vs 2479 kcal, 935-4023, among low socioeconomic status), while older age groups reported fewer changes in purchasing. Higher usual purchasing levels were associated with greater reductions during pandemic restrictions and vice versa, except for the absolute difference in alcohol purchasing, which increased the most for those with higher pre-pandemic purchasing (lowest 123 2 mL, 95% CI 71 3-175 0; highest 708 3 mL, 381 3-1035 3). INTERPRETATION: Pandemic restrictions were associated with marked changes in purchasing, notably increases in energy and alcohol and decreases in ultra-processed-food and out-of-home purchasing, which differed by individual characteristics. Future research should ascertain if changes persisted, if these changes translate into changes in health, and whether other regions experienced similar effects.

Health outcomes are worse for those in lower socio-economic groups, ethnic minority groups, and those with protected characteristics. In the UK, this has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis. Children and young people accessing hospitals can have unmet health and wellbeing needs, yet the role of hospitals in addressing these is not clear. We engaged with children and young people and caregivers from under-represented groups, often excluded from patient and public involvement, to understand their experiences, in order to support the co-design of future research and interventions. METHODS: A series of virtual and physical engagement events were held in Northwest England between March 9, and May 19, 2023. Community groups in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation, carers of children living with disabilities, adolescent care leavers, and school children were contacted through local websites. The concept of health inequalities was introduced at the start of sessions, and participants were encouraged to reflect on their own experiences. Discussions were co-facilitated with community leaders. Events focused on exploring experiences of health inequalities in relation to health care and views on future research. Ethics approval was not required as this was preparatory work; however, written consent was sought. Financial compensation was provided. FINDINGS: A total of 30 participants (aged 10 years and older) participated in four, 90 min events. Themes included: difficulties with transport and navigating services, lack of staff awareness about disabilities, and concerns about transitioning to adult services. Groups expressed varied opinions about research into health inequalities. The topic was considered to be important, and remuneration for participation was felt to be crucial. This is important because of the long-term nature of health inequality outcomes, which result in no immediate benefit to participants themselves. INTERPRETATION: Users of health-care services-including rarely heard groups-welcome research into health inequalities, but they identified important future considerations. Limitations of the work include its small scale and its location in a single geographical area. The outputs of this study will be combined with a scoping review and a review of local population data and will be essential in designing future research and producing recommendations for health-care services.

The COVID-19 pandemic also has accelerated this increase, raising significant concerns about adolescent emotional wellbeing. Research suggests that adolescents who live in more deprived areas are more likely to experience poor emotional wellbeing. Children in the northwest of England are among those with the poorest outcomes in the UK. We aimed to investigate the association between deprivation and mental health outcomes from 2019 to 2022. The aim was to support local authorities with targeted provision of public health services as well as predicting service need for 2022 onwards. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analysed routinely collected Schools Health Needs Assessment (SHNA) data. The School Health Needs Assessment dataset contained 32 676 responses from Year 6 (ages 10-11 years) and Year 9 (ages 13-14 years) who completed the annual survey in 2019-22. The questionnaire was offered to all mainstream schools, delivered by the public health school nursing service. Index of multiple deprivation (IMD) data were provided for household postcodes. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS. Factor analysis created a composite emotional wellbeing scale (EWS) and estimates generated by school year (Years 6 and 9) and three academic years (2019-22). We calculated correlations between IMD and EWS overall and within school and academic year samples. FINDINGS: The final total sample across the three consecutive survey years and the two school years was 32 659. The sample consisted of 15 932 (49%) female students and 5066 (16%) students who registered at school as from an ethnic minority. Of the total sample, 9209 (28%) lived in a postcode in the most deprived IMD quintile in England. There was an overall decrease in EWS from Year 6 to Year 9 and from 2019 to 2022. The Year 6 students in 2022 reported mean levels of EWS equivalent to Year 9 students in 2019 indicating a shift toward poorer mental health in younger children. The correlational analyses showed no significant associations between IMD and EWS scores within the school or academic year cohorts. A follow-up analysis of children in receipt or not in receipt of free school meals also showed no significant association with EWS scores. INTERPRETATION: Findings showed that the emotional wellbeing of children and young people in the northwest of England has deteriorated since 2019, with greatest changes observed in the younger cohort of children in Year 6. This was not explained by postcode-based indices of multiple deprivation. Although it is recognised that deprivation is both a cause and a result of poor mental health, policy decisions on service provision for children and young people should not be based solely on IMD or receipt of free school meals.

The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults from GlaxoSmithKline was the first RSV vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in early May 2023, followed by the subsequent FDA approval of Pfizer's RSV vaccines for older adults and pregnant women. We aimed to estimate the public health impact of the potential population-level administrations of the RSVpreF vaccine in the UK. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used national census and contact survey data to construct an individual-based mathematical model, with interpersonal connections characterising household structure, social settings, and age-specific contact patterns. We considered both within-host viral-load dynamics and between-host RSV transmission. We modelled the coverages of RSV vaccines for older people (age >=60 years) and pregnant women, using influenza vaccination data from the 2018-19 season. We explored a range of possible transmissibility and estimated the health burden averted by RSVpreF vaccine over a 300-day period as compared with the control scenario without vaccines. FINDINGS: In a low-transmission scenario (Re=1 2), RSVpreF would avert a total population of 2 35 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1 24-3 77) million infections, 12.80 (95% CrI 8 60-17 06) thousand hospital admissions, and 0 93 (95% CrI 0 69-1 25) thousand deaths, with 1 82 (1 41-2 33) million infections, 12 44 (8 50-16 38) thousand hospital admissions, and 0 93 (0 67-1 23) thousand deaths averted for people aged 60 years and older. In a high-transmission scenario (Re=2 0), RSVpreF would avert 2 01 (1 37-2 68) million infections, 14 67 (10 05-18 33) thousand hospital admissions, and 1 12 (0 80-1 35) thousand deaths. The majority averted would still be among older adults. INTERPRETATION: Our mathematical models will help improve the vaccine schedules of RSVpreF. Future work will address several limitations when data become available, including the incorporation of population immunity, potential vaccine hesitancy, and other factors affecting vaccine uptake and effectiveness.

From the use of quasi-detention facilities and so-called contingency accommodation to outbreaks of diphtheria in processing centres, there is a worrying trend to normalise potentially damaging conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the health risks posed by contingency housing for asylum seekers in the UK. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, a 10-point online questionnaire was sent to professional networks working with refugees and asylum seekers within the UK. Responses were collected between March 4, and April 11, 2022, using a mixture of convenience and snowballing sampling approach. The objectives of the survey were (1) to identify and document unmet needs, (2) to offer practical support, and (3) to map out services and organisation. The survey was designed by six medical professionals with experience of working with migrants and validated by three doctors who had experience running out-reach medical clinics for asylum seekers within contingency accommodation. Background details of geographical location and occupation were collected, and a combination of closed and open questions were used to collect information across five domains (medical, legal social, integration, and basic essentials) using a social determinants of health framework. A code book thematic analysis using a deductive/inductive hybrid approach was used to identify health and social needs as well as specific rights being denied. FINDINGS: There were 68 responses from around the UK, of which 30 (44%) were health-care professionals, and 38 (56%) were from the wider voluntary sector. 45 (67%) had visited an accommodation site, and 21 (33%) had worked with those living in contingency accommodation in other respects. Respondents reported observations regarding sites across most parts of the UK. Major themes of access to health-care, access to other services, barriers to access, and safeguarding were identified, with subthemes on access to primary care, maternity, and mental health services (eg, \"Vast unmet need in mental health provision, several suicide attempts\"); access to basic essential services (eg, \"Food was not fit for purpose\" \"[c]hildren often did not receive breakfast\"); education, and legal support; and frequent moving and communication. INTERPRETATION: Through several themes we highlight the substantial impact of structural isolation of asylum seekers through contingency housing, its major effects on wellbeing and the exacerbation of health inequities. We are using these results to work with asylum seekers and local non-governmental organisations to campaign for improved housing conditions. Study limitations include sampling bias, and a lack of voices of those with lived experience.

However, the contribution of poor health literacy and low levels of trust in state institutions to mental distress is less well defined. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 health literacy and trust in the pandemic response (Trust) on mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. METHODS: We did this nationally representative cross-sectional survey of adult Irish residents during three study periods: from May 26 to June 17, 2020 (n=947); from July 1 to July 23, 2020 (n=995); and from Sept 5 to Sept 28, 2020 (n=972). Participants were contacted using random-digit-dialling and interviewed by a professional market research organisation (Ipsos MRBI' about 80% via mobile phone, 20% via landline). Mental distress was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS), for which a score of 10 or higher indicated mental distress. Heath literacy and trust were each assessed with three questions, which defined three categories: low, moderate, and high (appendix). Descriptive analysis and multivariate (MVA) Poisson regression were conducted in STATA17, Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) are reported. FINDINGS: 2914 participants completed the survey across three study periods (median age 46 years, 1510 [51 8%] women, 1401 [48 1%] men, three [0 1%] non-binary). 804 (27 6%) of 2914 participants experienced mental distress (n=804). More women experienced mental distress than men (508 [34%] of women vs 294 [21%] of men). Mental distress was inversely associated with age (from 43% in those aged <30 years [n=232/539] to 19% in those aged >70 years [n=66/349]). Most participants had high health literacy (n=2,530, 86 8%). While health literacy was positively and significantly associated with trust, it was not associated with mental distress and it was therefore excluded from the MVA. Level of trust was captured for 2693 adults; 42 2% participants reported low trust (n=457) or moderate trust (n=679). The prevalence of mental distress was inversely associated with trust; increasing from 24% in those with high trust (n=374/1557), 30% in those with moderate trust (n=202/679), to 36% in those with low trust (n=166/457). In MVA higher rates of mental distress were associated with low trust (IRR 1 45, 95% CI 1 20-1 75; p=0 000) and moderate trust (IRR 1 24, 1 04-1 47, p=0 016) compared with high trust when adjusted for age, sex, employment status, and income,. INTERPRETATION: In Ireland, low levels of trust in the COVID-19 pandemic response were associated with higher levels of mental distress. Although poor health literacy was associated with low levels of trust, it was not independently associated with mental distress. Inference on the nature and direction of causal effects must be cautious given the cross-sectional study design.

This study tested the impact of a behavioural science-informed reminder SMS, and animated video intervention on screening uptake. METHODS: This three-armed randomised controlled trial took place in two screening services in London (each service operated across a range of static sites such as hospitals, and mobile sites). We included participants who were registered with GP as female, aged 50-70 years, and not screened in the past 3 years. We excluded those who had opted out of screening messages or were in care. Participants were assigned into three groups via the final two digits of their NHS number (ratio 34:33:33): control group (received usual care reminder), behavSMS group (behavioural science-informed SMS reminder addressing reducing negative emotions and information on health consequences), or behavSMS+video group (behavioural SMS plus link to animation). Researchers were masked to allocation. The SMS and video were co-designed with stakeholders using the Behaviour Change Wheel. Invitation processes changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore, we did separate analyses for those receiving a timed appointment (n=9027), and an open invitation to book an appointment (n=25 020). Messages were sent 7 days and 1 day before the appointment, plus 7 days after the open invitation letter. Group differences in the primary outcome of attendance within 3 months of invitation (and secondary outcome of booking for open invites) were assessed using chi2, and logistic regression controlling for age, ethnicity, deprivation, and first invitation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05395871. FINDINGS: Recruitment took place between July 18, and Oct 21, 2022. For timed invitations, 3094 participants were assigned to the control group, 2952 to the behavSMS group, and 2981 to the behavSMS+video group. For open invitations groups sizes were 8654, 8095, and 8271 respectively. Median age was 59 years for participants who received a timed appointment, and 58 years for those who received an open invitation. There were no attendance differences for timed appointments (intention-to-treat analysis): 71 9% (2225/3094) in control group; 69 9% (2064/2952) in behavSMS group; 71 7% (2137/2981) in behavSMS+video group (chi2(2)=3 47, p=0 176), even when controlling for covariates. There were no attendance differences for open invitations either: 7 4% (4104/8654) in control group, 8 3% (3909/8095) in behavSMS group, 48 1% (3978/8271) in behavSMS+video (chi2(2)=1 40, p=0 497), including when controlling for covariates. However, in the per-protocol analysis (of those with valid mobile numbers), intervention groups were more likely to book an appointment: 44 7% (3238/7274) in control group, 46 3% (3121/6744) in behavSMS group, and 46 3% (3199/6910) in behavSMS+video group (chi2(2)=6 01, p=0 050). INTERPRETATION: Despite positive stakeholder feedback during co-design, the SMS or SMS+video interventions did not increase breast screening attendance compared with the usual SMS reminder. A limitation is that only 5 8% participants followed the video link. Links within SMS are unlikely to be an effective way to disseminate video content, and alternative options are being explored.

Recent studies have implicated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, specifically perlecan LG3, in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2. However, the role of perlecan LG3 in SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the binding interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and perlecan LG3 through molecular modeling simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. Our results indicate stable binding between LG3 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD, which may potentially enhance RBD-ACE2 interactions. These findings shed light on the role of perlecan LG3 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.

A comparative analysis of pooled procurement mechanisms for health commodities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"infons": {"type": "abstract", "section": "Abstract"}, "offset": 109, "text": "INTRODUCTION: Pooled procurement can be seen as a collaboration initiative of buyers. Such mechanisms have received increased attention during the Covid-19 pandemic to improve access to affordable and quality-assured health commodities. The structural form of pooled procurement mechanisms ranges from a third-party organization that procures on behalf of its buyers to a buyer's owned mechanism in which buyers operate more collaboratively. However, little is known about how these types of pooled procurement mechanisms differ in terms of characteristics, implementation and developmental process. To fill this gap, we compared four pooled procurement mechanisms. Two buyer's owned mechanisms: the Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Pacific Island Countries (PIC). And two third-party mechanisms: the Global Drug Facility (GDF) and the Asthma Drug Facility (ADF). METHODS: For this qualitative study, we used a multiple case-study design. The cases were purposefully selected, based on a most-similar case study design. We used the Pooled Procurement Guidance to collect data on individual cases and compared our findings between the case studies. For our analysis, we drew upon peer-reviewed academic articles, grey literature documents and 9 semi-structured interviews with procurement experts. RESULTS: Buyers within a buyer's owned mechanisms differ in procurement systems, financing structures, product needs and regulatory and legal frameworks. Therefore, buyers within such mechanisms require relative alignment on motivations, goals and operations of the mechanism. Our study showed that buyers' relative homogeneity of characteristics and their perceived urgency of the problems was particularly relevant for achieving that alignment. Third-party organization mechanisms require less alignment and consensus-building between buyers. To participate, buyers need to align with the operations of the third-party organization, instead of other buyers. Elements that were essential for the successful implementation and operation of such mechanisms included the procurement secretariat's ability to create local and global awareness around the problem, to induce political will to act upon the problem, to mobilize sufficient funding and to attract qualified staff. CONCLUSION: To successfully sustain pooled procurement mechanisms over time, key actors should drive the mechanism through continuous and reflexive work on stakeholder engagement, mobilization of funding and alignment of interests and needs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 256, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C111757", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PIC", "locations": [{"offset": 895, "length": 3}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996877, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:C111757", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Global Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Parmaksiz K", "van de Bovenkamp H", "Bal R"]}

Understanding COVID testing and care pathways is important for assessing the impact and cost-effectiveness of testing in the real world, yet there is limited information on these pathways in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). We therefore undertook an expert consultation to better understand testing policies and practices, clinical screening, the profile of patients seeking testing or care, linkage to care after testing, treatment, lessons learnt and expected changes in 2023. METHODS: We organized a qualitative consultation with ten experts from seven LMICs (India, Indonesia, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) identified through purposive sampling. We conducted structured interviews during six regional consultations, and undertook a thematic analysis of responses. RESULTS: Participants reported that, after initial efforts to scale-up testing, the policy priority given to COVID testing has declined. Comorbidities putting patients at heightened risk (e.g., diabetes) mainly relied on self-identification. The decision to test following clinical screening was highly context-/location-specific, often dictated by local epidemiology and test availability. When rapid diagnostic tests were available, public sector healthcare providers tended to rely on them for diagnosis (alongside PCR for Asian/Latin American participants), while private sector providers predominantly used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Positive test results were generally taken at 'face value' by clinicians, although negative tests with a high index of suspicion may be confirmed with PCR. However, even with a positive result, patients were not always linked to care in a timely manner because of reluctance to receiving care or delays in returning to care centres upon clinical deterioration. Countries often lacked multiple components of the range of therapeutics advised in WHO guidelines: notably so for oral antivirals designed for high-risk mild patients. Severely ill patients mostly received corticosteroids and, in higher-resourced settings, tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Testing does not always prompt enhanced care, due to reluctance on the part of patients and limited therapeutic availability within clinical settings.

Compared with children in the non-PB group, those in the PB group had longer duration of hospitalization, increased levels of neutrophil (N), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST); lower levels of lymphocyte (L) and platelet (PLT); and higher incidence of lack of appetite, decreased breath sounds, single lobar infiltrate, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mucosal erosion and/or necrosis, and bronchial embolization. L levels and pleural effusion were identified as risk factors in multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: Children with PB caused by MPP had a strong and local inflammatory response. L levels and pleural effusion were independent risk factors of PB with MPP in children. Our findings will help clinicians identify potential PB in pediatric patients for early and effective intervention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "9606",

Not only can it cause mental and physical problems in pregnant women, but it may also affect the growth of the fetus. However, there are few reports on the prevalence and influencing factors of insomnia symptoms in third-trimester women in China. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of insomnia symptoms among pregnant women in the third trimester in a moderately developing region of China and to further explore the associated factors of insomnia symptoms from various aspects. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among eligible pregnant women in the third trimester from December 2022 to February 2023. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and behavioral and psychological characteristics of pregnant women were collected through a structured questionnaire. The Chi-square test and multivariate logistics regression were applied to explore the associated factors of insomnia symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 535 pregnant women in the third trimester were included in this study, and the prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 59.8%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that pregnant women who lived together with elders (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.86), had low perceived stress (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35-0.97), had no threatened abortion (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.93) and had good doctor-patient communication (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98) were more likely to stay away from insomnia symptoms. However, pregnant women with anxiety symptoms (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.28-4.03), fear of childbirth (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.11-2.40) and a high experience of COVID-19 fear (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.54) tended to have insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of insomnia symptoms in pregnant women is high in Lianyungang city in eastern China in the third trimester. Insomnia symptoms is influenced by multiple factors. There is an urgent need to develop interventions to reduce the prevalence of insomnia symptoms in the third trimester and to focus on pregnant women with risk factors for insomnia symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Insomnia", "locations": [{"offset": 155, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012893", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "sleep disorder", "locations": [{"offset": 183, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 251, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 371, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 502, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 539, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 615, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 648, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 769, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 881, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1077, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1242, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1294, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1374, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1468, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "48", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 1554, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "49", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000031", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "abortion", "locations": [{"offset": 1610, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "50", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1669, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "51", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1756, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "52", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1793, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "53", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004421", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1804, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "54", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1926, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "55", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1985, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "56", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 2035, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "57", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2065, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "58", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 2140, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "59", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 2270, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "60", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2336, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "61", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007319", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "insomnia symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 2364, "length": 17}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996812, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D000079225", "disease@MESH:D000031", "disease@MESH:D012893", "disease@MESH:D007319", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D004421"], "journal": "BMC Public Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Chen X", "Liu Y", "Liu M", "Min F", "Tong J", "Wei W", "Sun L", "Zhang T", "Meng Q"]}

IPC guidelines, with standard and transmission-based precautions to be put in place to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at these HCFs were developed. Based on these IPC guidelines, a rapid assessment scorecard tool, with 14 components, to enhance assessment and improvement of IPC measures at HCFs was developed. This study assessed the level of implementation of the IPC measures in HCFs across the African Region during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An observational study was conducted from April 2020 to November 2022 in 17 countries in the African Region to monitor the progress made in implementing IPC standard and transmission-based precautions in primary-, secondary- and tertiary-level HCFs. A total of 5168 primary, secondary and tertiary HCFs were assessed. The HCFs were assessed and scored each component of the tool. Statistical analyses were done using R (version 4.2.0). RESULTS: A total of 11 564 assessments were conducted in 5153 HCFs, giving an average of 2.2 assessments per HCF. The baseline median score for the facility assessments was 60.2%. Tertiary HCFs and those dedicated to COVID-19 patients had the highest IPC scores. Tertiary-level HCFs had a median score of 70%, secondary-level HCFs 62.3% and primary-level HCFs 56.8%. HCFs dedicated to COVID-19 patients had the highest scores, with a median of 68.2%, followed by the mixed facilities that attended to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, with 64.84%. On the components, there was a strong correlation between high IPC assessment scores and the presence of IPC focal points in HCFs, the availability of IPC guidelines in HCFs and HCFs that had all their health workers trained in basic IPC. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a functional IPC programme with a dedicated focal person is a prerequisite for implementing improved IPC measures at the HCF level.

However, testing with high sensitivity methods, such as quantitative RT-PCR, leads to unnecessary isolation, whereas the lateral flow antigen test shows low sensitivity and false negative results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test (Lumira Ag), a rapid microfluidic immunofluorescence method, in assessing infectivity. METHODS: This study was performed from March 2022 to July 2022. A pair of nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from each patient with mild COVID-19. One swab was used for Lumira Ag testing, and the other for quantitative RT-PCR testing and virus culture. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were included in the study. Among them, PCR, Lumira Ag test, and virus culture indicated positivity for 82, 66, and 24 patients, respectively. When comparing the Lumira Ag test to virus culture, its sensitivity was 100.0% (24/24), specificity, 30.0% (18/60); positive predictive value, 36.3% (24/66); and negative predictive value (NPV), 100.0% (18/18). The positive sample for virus culture was observed until the ninth day from the onset of symptoms, while the Lumira Ag test was observed until day 11. CONCLUSIONS: The Lumira Ag test showed high sensitivity and NPV (100% each) compared to virus culture. A test-based strategy using the Lumira Ag test can effectively exclude COVID-19 infectiousness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 167, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 193, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 277, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040626", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "LumiraDx", "locations": [{"offset": 550, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C035876", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "CoV-2 Ag", "locations": [{"offset": 564, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 791, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 809, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 948, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1076, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1636, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996783, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "chemical@MESH:C035876", "chemical@MESH:C040626", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "BMC Infect Dis", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Ota K", "Kodama H", "Kawamoto Y", "Sasaki D", "Mitsumoto-Kaseida F", "Sakamoto K", "Kosai K", "Hasegawa H", "Takazono T", "Izumikawa K", "Mukae H", "Tun MMN", "Morita K", "Yanagihara K"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The objective of this work was to investigate the relationship among nervous system biomarkers (NfL, TAU, GFAP, and UCH-L1), biochemical parameters, and viral loads with heterogeneous outcomes in a cohort of severe COVID-19 patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a university hospital. For that, 108 subjects were recruited within the first 5 days at ICU. In parallel, 16 mild COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Severe COVID-19 group was divided between \"deceased\" and \"survivor.\" All subjects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection. NfL, total TAU, GFAP, and UCH-L1 quantification in plasma was performed using SIMOA SR-X platform. Of 108 severe patients, 36 (33.33%) presented neurological manifestation and 41 (37.96%) died. All four biomarkers - GFAP, NfL, TAU, and UCH-L1 - were significantly higher among deceased patients in comparison to survivors (p < 0.05). Analyzing biochemical biomarkers, higher Peak Serum Ferritin, D-Dimer Peak, Gamma-glutamyltransferase, and C-Reactive Protein levels were related to death (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, GFAP, NfL, TAU, UCH-L1, and Peak Serum Ferritin levels were correlated to death. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 viral load, no statistical difference was observed for any group. Thus, Ferritin, NFL, GFAP, TAU, and UCH-L1 are early biomarkers of severity and lethality of SARS-COV-2 infection and may be important tools for therapeutic decision-making in the acute phase of

Endocytosis and fusion at the cell surface are conditioned by cell type-specific restriction factors and the presence of enzymes required for activation of the viral fusogen. Whereas fusion with the plasma membrane is considered the main pathway to productive infection of low pH-independent entry viruses, endocytosis is also productive and may be the main route of the highly efficient cell-to-cell dissemination of viruses. Alternative receptors, membrane cofactors, and the presence of enzymes processing the fusion protein at the cell membrane, determine the balance between fusion and endocytosis in specific target cells. Characterization of the mode of entry in particular cell culture conditions is desirable to better assess the effect of neutralizing and blocking agents and their mechanism of action. Whatever the pathway of virus internalization, production of the viral proteins into the cells can lead to the expression of the viral fusion protein on the cell surface; if this protein is able to induce membrane fusion at physiological pH, it promotes the fusion of the infected cell with surrounding uninfected cells, leading to the formation of syncytia or heterokaryons.

The eicosanoids derived from omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs have opposite characteristics of pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. The proinflammatory effects of omega-6 PUFAs are behind the pathology of the adverse health conditions of PUFA metabolism like cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and inflammatory diseases. A balanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 1-4:1 is critical to prevent the associated disorders. But due to modern agricultural practices, there is a disastrous shift in this ratio to 10-20:1. This review primarily aims to discuss the myriad health potentials of omega-3 PUFAs uncovered through recent research. It further manifests the importance of maintaining a balanced omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA ratio. RECENT FINDINGS: omega-3 PUFAs exhibit protective effects against diabetes mellitus-associated complications including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and proteinuria. COVID-19 is also not an exception to the health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs. Supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs improved the respiratory and clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. omega-3 PUFAs exhibit a variety of health benefits including anti-inflammatory property and antimicrobial property and are effective in protecting against various health conditions like atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, COVID-19, and neurological disorders. In the present review, various health potentials of omega-3 PUFAs are extensively reviewed and summarized. Further, the importance of a balanced omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA ratio has been emphasized besides stating the diverse sources of omega-3 PUFA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "35", "infons":

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who visited our long-COVID outpatients' clinic due to long-COVID symptoms from February 2021 to December 2022. MEASUREMENTS: Total triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, anti-thyroperoxidase, and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies were measured for thyroid assessment. Other hormones measured were growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total testosterone, plasma insulin, and C-peptide. Blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were also measured. To assess adrenal reserve, an ACTH stimulation test was performed. The fatigue assessment scale (FAS) was used to evaluate fatigue severity. RESULTS: Eighty-four adult patients were included. Overall, 40.5% of the patients had at least one endocrine disorder. These included prediabetes (21.4%), low DHEA-S (21.4%), subclinical hypothyroidism (3.6%), non-specific thyroid function abnormality (7.1%), thyroid autoimmunity (7.1%), low testosterone in males (6.6%), and low IGF-1 (3.6%). All patients had normal adrenal reserve. Long-COVID-19 symptoms were present in all patients and the most commonly reported symptom was fatigue (89.3%). The FAS score was higher than normal (>= 22) in 42.8% of patients. There were no associations between patients' symptoms and hormone levels. Diabetic patients reported confusion (p = 0.020) and hair loss (p = 0.040) more often than non-diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of endocrine function 3 months after a positive SARS-CoV2 test revealed only subclinical syndromes.

Additionally, qualitative and quantitative antibacterial assays on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii revealed excellent antibacterial activity with a CFU reduction of 98-100% within only 4 h of exposure. The treated curtain was aged 6 months before testing. Similarly, the antiviral activity tested according to ISO-18184 with murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed > 99% viral reduction with the functionalized curtain. Also, the released active compounds of the coating 24 +- 5 microg mL-1 revealed no acute in vitro skin toxicity (IC50: 95 microg mL-1) and skin sensitization.

An online, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted among undergraduates using pre-tested, self-administered questionnaires from the randomly selected five faculties: Allied Health Sciences, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences, Management and Finance, and Medicine. Undergraduates were invited to complete the Google Form. Socio-demographic details and a 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (21-DASS) were used for data collection. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using a Sinhala version of the 21-DASS scale. Ethical permission was granted by the Ethics Review Committee of the Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, University of Ruhuna. Among the 359 undergraduates, the majority were represented by females (62.1%). The mean age of the sample was 23.67 years (SD +- 1.6). Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found to be prevalent in 53.7%, 41.8%, and 63.8% of undergraduates respectively. Younger and female undergraduates had more impact on psychological issues than their counterparts. It revealed a significant positive correlation between anxiety and depressive symptoms (r = 0.646, p < .001), anxiety and stress (r = 0.868, p < .001), and stress and anxiety (r = 0.786, p < .001). Most undergraduates experienced considerable levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the Covid-19 as increasing stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, tend to increase all types of psychological disturbances. The development of mental health among undergraduates is essential and needs innovative strategies to improve the psychological well-being of undergraduates. The initiation of a stress management programme and expanded available counseling services are also important.

METHODS: We analyzed German health insurance claims data to compare the suicide risk of patients with severe mental disorders before and during the pandemic. We included n = 690,845 patients between October 2019 and March 2020 and n = 693,457 patients the corresponding period of the previous year and applied entropy balancing to adjust for confounding covariates. Given that the cause of death was unknown, we defined potential suicides as deaths of patients with a history of intentional self-harm whose passing could not be explained by COVID-19. Potential suicides were tracked in both cohorts over one year and compared using logistic regression. RESULTS: 128 potential suicides were identified in the period during and 101 before the pandemic. This corresponded to a significant increase in the risk for potential suicide of 27.4% compared to the control period (beta = 0.24, z = 1.82, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The noticeable increase in the risk for potential suicide for patients with severe pre-existing mental disorders emphasizes the call for additional efforts to prevent suicide and to help patients cope with their mental illness in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 220, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 269, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001523", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mental disorders", "locations": [{"offset": 290, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 407, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001523", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mental disorders", "locations": [{"offset": 428, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 501, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 562, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 709, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 761, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 771, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 860, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1297, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001523", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mental disorders", "locations": [{"offset": 1331, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1422, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002908", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mental illness", "locations": [{"offset": 1447, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1486, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996604, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D002908", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D001523", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Engels A", "Stein J", "Riedel-Heller SG", "Konnopka C", "K&#xf6;nig HH"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

In this cross-sectional study, a total of 2471 subjects (1256 males and 1215 females) were selected in the population of Kermanshah in the west of Iran, using the convenience sampling method. Physical activity levels were assessed using the physical activity (PA) questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF), and mood state was measured by the abbreviated form of the Iranian version of the standard POMS questionnaire (Bill Morgan 1979). Participants completed the online questionnaire between March 28th and May 20th, 2020. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and percentage), and deductive (Chi-square and Spearman's correlation) were used for data analysis. our study found that the majority of participants reported decreased PA levels during the quarantine period. Specifically, 71.7% reported a decrease in moderate-intensity physical activity, 80.5% reported a decrease in high-intensity PA, and 71.3% reported a decrease in the total volume of PA.

General fatigue is frequently observed in patients with long COVID during acute and post-acute phases. This study aimed to identify the specific risk factors for general fatigue in long COVID. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged over 18 years were enrolled in a multicenter cohort study at 26 medical institutions. Clinical data during hospitalization and patient-reported outcomes after discharge were collected from medical records, paper-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps. RESULTS: Among prolonged symptoms through 1-year follow-ups, general fatigue was the most interfering symptom in daily life. Patients with protracted fatigue at all follow-up periods had lower quality of life scores at the 12-month follow-up. Univariate logistic regression analysis of the presence or absence of general fatigue at the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups identified asthma, younger age, and female sex as risk factors for prolonged fatigue. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that asthma was an independent risk factor for persistent fatigue during the 12-month follow-up period. Longitudinal changes in the symptoms of patients with or without asthma demonstrated that general fatigue, not cough and dyspnea, was significantly prolonged in patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In a Japanese population with long COVID, prolonged general fatigue was closely linked to asthma.

Image-processing medical disciplines, such as pathology, are expected to be transformed by deep learning. The first clinically applicable deep-learning diagnostic support tools are already available in cancer pathology, and their number is increasing. However, data on the environmental sustainability of these tools are scarce. We aimed to conduct an environmental-sustainability analysis of a theoretical implementation of deep learning in patient-care pathology. METHODS: For this modelling study, we first assembled and calculated relevant data and parameters of a digital-pathology workflow. Data were breast and prostate specimens from the university clinic at the Institute of Pathology of the Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen (Aachen, Germany), for which commercially available deep learning was already available. Only specimens collected between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2019 were used, to omit potential biases due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our final selection was based on 2 representative weeks outside holidays, covering different types of specimens. To calculate carbon dioxide (CO2) or CO2 equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions of deep learning in pathology, we gathered relevant data for exact numbers and sizes of whole-slide images (WSIs), which were generated by scanning histopathology samples of prostate and breast specimens. We also evaluated different data input scenarios (including all slide tiles, only tiles containing tissue, or only tiles containing regions of interest). To convert estimated energy consumption from kWh to CO2 eq, we used the internet protocol address of the computational server and the Electricity Maps database to obtain information on the sources of the local electricity grid (ie, renewable vs non-renewable), and estimated the number of trees and proportion of the local and world's forests needed to sequester the CO2 eq emissions. We calculated the computational requirements and CO2 eq emissions of 30 deep-learning models that varied in task and size. The first scenario represented the use of one commercially available deep-learning model for one task in one case (1-task), the second scenario considered two deep-learning models for two tasks per case (2-task), the third scenario represented a future, potentially automated workflow that could handle 7 tasks per case (7-task), and the fourth scenario represented the use of a single potential, large, computer-vision model that could conduct multiple tasks (multitask). We also compared the performance (ie, accuracy) and CO2 eq emissions of different deep-learning models for the classification of renal cell carcinoma on WSIs, also from Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen. We also tested other approaches to reducing CO2 eq emissions, including model pruning and an alternative method for histopathology analysis (pathomics). FINDINGS: The pathology database contained 35 552 specimens (237 179 slides), 6420 of which were prostate specimens (10 115 slides) and 11 801 of which were breast specimens (19 763 slides). We selected and subsequently digitised 140 slides from eight breast-cancer cases and 223 slides from five prostate-cancer cases. Applying large deep-learning models on all WSI tiles of prostate and breast pathology cases would result in yearly CO2 eq emissions of 7 65 metric tons (t; 95% CI 7 62-7 68) with the use of a single deep-learning model per case; yearly CO2 eq emissions were up to 100 56 t (100 21-100 99) with the use of seven deep-learning models per case. CO2 eq emissions for different deep-learning model scenarios, data inputs, and deep-learning model sizes for all slides varied from 3 61 t (3 59-3 63) to 2795 30 t (1177 51-6482 13. For the estimated number of overall pathology cases worldwide, the yearly CO2 eq emissions varied, reaching up to 16 megatons (Mt) of CO2 eq, requiring up to 86 590 km2 (0 22%) of world forest to sequester the CO2 eq emissions. Use of the 7-task scenario and small deep-learning models on slides containing tissue only could substantially reduce CO2 eq emissions worldwide by up to 141 times (0 1 Mt, 95% CI 0 1-0 1). Considering the local environment in Aachen, Germany, the maximum CO2 eq emission from the use of deep learning in digital pathology only would require 32 8% (95% CI 13 8-76 6) of the local forest to sequester the CO2 eq emissions. A single pathomics run on a tissue could provide information that was comparable to or even better than the output of multitask deep-learning models, but with 147 times reduced CO2 eq emissions. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that widespread use of deep learning in pathology might have considerable global-warming potential. The medical community, policy decision makers, and the public should be aware of this potential and encourage the use of CO2 eq emissions reduction strategies where possible.

This is in part because ultrasound equipment is available in many settings, more training programmes are educating trainees in this technique, and ultrasound can be done rapidly without exposure to radiation. The aim of this review is to present the most interesting and innovative aspects of the use of TU in the study of thoracic diseases. In pleural diseases, TU has been a real revolution. It helps to differentiate between different types of pleural effusions, guides the performance of pleural biopsies when necessary and is more cost-effective under these conditions, and assists in the decision to remove thoracic drainage after talc pleurodesis. With the advent of COVID19, the use of TU has increased for the study of lung involvement. Nowadays it helps in the diagnosis of pneumonias, tumours and interstitial diseases, and its use is becoming more and more widespread in the Pneumology ward. In recent years, TU guided biopsies have been shown to be highly cost-effective, with other advantages such as the absence of radiation and the possibility of being performed at bedside. The use of contrast in ultrasound to increase the cost-effectiveness of these biopsies is very promising. In the study of the mediastinum and peripheral pulmonary nodules, the introduction of echobronchoscopy has brought about a radical change. It is a fully established technique in the study of lung cancer patients. The introduction of elastography may help to further improve its cost-effectiveness. In critically-ill patients, diaphragmatic ultrasound helps in the assessment of withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, and is now an indispensable tool in the management of these patients. In neuromuscular patients, ultrasound is a good predictor of impaired lung function. Currently, in Neuromuscular Disease Units, TU is an indispensable tool. Ultrasound study of the intercostal musculature is also effective in the study of respiratory function, and is widely used in Respiratory Rehabilitation. In Intermediate Care Units, thoracic ultrasound is indispensable for patient management. In these units there are ultrasound protocols for the management of patients with acute dyspnoea that have proven to be very effective.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013896", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "thoracic diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 468, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010995", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pleural diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 490, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010996", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pleural effusions", "locations": [{"offset": 592, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID19", "locations": [{"offset": 819, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008175", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pneumonias, tumours", "locations": [{"offset": 929, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D017563", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "interstitial diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 953, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008175", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "lung cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1533, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1545, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D016638", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "critically-ill", "locations": [{"offset": 1643, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1658, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1818, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1845, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009468", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Neuromuscular Disease", "locations": [{"offset": 1927, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2208, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2296, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000208", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "acute dyspnoea", "locations": [{"offset": 2310, "length": 14}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996336, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D009468", "disease@MESH:D010996", "disease@MESH:D010995", "disease@MESH:D013896", "disease@MESH:D000208", "disease@MESH:D017563", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D008175", "disease@MESH:D016638"], "journal": "Arch Bronconeumol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Romero Romero B", "Vollmer Torrubiano I", "Mart&#xed;n Juan J", "Heili Frades S", "P&#xe9;rez Pallares J", "Pajares Ruiz V", "Wang&#xfc;emert P&#xe9;rez A", "Cristina Ramos H", "Cases Viedma E"]}

METHODS: Healthcare workers who had received an mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273 or BNT-162b2) as the first booster (third dose) 12 weeks prior were recruited. Participants voluntarily received either NVX-CoV2373 or an mRNA vaccine as a second booster. Participants with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded. The primary outcomes included serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) and neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.1.529 (Omicron) BA2, and BA5 variants on the 28th day after the boost. Secondary outcomes included new SARS-CoV-2 infections and adverse events reported during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 160 participants were enrolled in this study. Compared with the mRNA vaccination group (n = 59), the NVX-CoV2373 vaccination group (n = 101) had significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers against all variants tested after the boost. During the study period, higher rates of new SARS-CoV-2 infections and a lower incidence of adverse events were observed in the NVX-CoV2373 vaccination group.

Conflicting information in the media leads to parental anxiety and confusion around COVID-19 vaccination in children. The scepticism expressed by certain experts regarding the importance of COVID-19 vaccines in children has also had a negative impact on parental attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. This study aimed to understand parental concerns and preferences for paediatric COVID-19 vaccination, and identify potential vaccination promotion (\"nudge\") interventions to optimise paediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake. METHODS: Mixed methods including Focus Group Discussions and a Discrete Choice Experiment survey were used. The Discrete Choice Experiment survey design was based on a literature review and the findings of Focus Group Discussions. The study was conducted on a nationally representative sample of parents in Australia. RESULTS: In total, 1039 parents participated in the study. Parents showed strong preferences for a COVID-19 vaccine with lower risk of serious side effects and longer protection duration, followed by higher vaccine effectiveness and delivery via oral tablets. Promotion strategies were similarly preferred by parents. Latent class logit analysis identified three groups, interpretable as COVID-19 vaccine \"accepters (35.3%)\", \"deliberators (31.7%)\", and \"rejecters (33.1%)\". The \"deliberators\" composed of more parents, residing in metropolitan areas, having concerns about vaccine effectiveness, and believing that disease risks outweigh vaccine benefits than the \"accepters\". The \"rejecters\" were more likely to not be vaccinated themselves, and generally have less trust in vaccines than the \"accepters\". The \"deliberators\" and \"rejecters\" were less likely to be parents aged >=25 years and complete final year of high school than the \"accepters\".

It's unclear if (or to what extent) breakthrough infection experiences impact public perceptions of COVID-vaccine effectiveness, though the answer may have significant implications for public health communications and ongoing vaccine acceptance. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 2,500 adults in the United States (February 27 - March 9, 2023) in order to better understand the relationship between breakthrough COVID-19 infections and perceived vaccine effectiveness. Survey respondents were selected using a stratified, quota sampling approach to ensure representativeness; analysis was conducted on responses from 1,928 participants who received a COVID-19 vaccine. FINDINGS: Among those who tested positive for COVID-19 after being vaccinated, 21.18 % said that COVID-19 vaccines had been \"less effective\" than they initially expected, compared with 10.0 % of those who did not experience any breakthrough infections (X2 = 75.551; phi = 0.198; p <= 0.001). Those who experienced their own breakthrough infection were 1.37 times less likely to report perceived vaccine efficacy, while those whose family members experienced a breakthrough infection were 1.64 times less likely to report the same, ceteris paribus. The largest effect was observed among those who experienced both a personal and familial breakthrough infection. This group was almost two times less likely to describe COVID-19 vaccines as \"very effective\". DISCUSSION: Breakthrough infections correlated with lower overall levels of perceived vaccine effectiveness, even after accounting for demographic and political considerations.

This study aims to describe and analyse patterns and trends in adult burns across New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory. METHODS: A NSW statewide retrospective review was conducted from 2017 to 2022 for adult patients with burns. A comparative analysis was performed for the COVID-19 group (2020-2022) and control group between 2017 and 2019. RESULTS: We found a total of 11,433 patients (7102 non-COVID vs 4331 COVID-19). The average age in the COVID-19 group was 1.4 years older than counterparts (40.6 vs 42.0, p < 0.001). The 18 - 25 and 36 - 45 age groups experienced significantly lower proportions of presentations, whereas, the 76-85 years experienced significantly higher proportions. There was a significantly higher proportion of pressure injuries (0.1% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001) and contact burns (17.2% vs 18.7%), but lower explosions (1.3% vs 0.2%) for the COVID-19 group compared to their counterparts. The mean TBSA% was 0.4% greater in the COVID-19 group compared to their counterparts (2.4 vs 2.8, p < 0.001). There were significantly more operating sessions (0.2 vs 0.3, p < 0.001). The mean length of stay was significantly greater by 0.8 days for the COVID-19 group compared to their counterparts (1.5 vs 2.3, p < 0.001).

Medical personnel have faced several clinical and non-clinical challenges because of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, which predisposes them to burn-out. There is a paucity of studies that shed light on the level of burn-out and its association with work-related factors for Nigerian medical doctors. This study aims to examine the level of burn-out among Nigerian medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore possible associations between burn-out and sociodemographic, work-related and COVID-19-related factors. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 251 medical doctors in a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. A questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic history, work-associated factors, COVID-19-related parameters and burn-out history. Personal, work-related and patient-related burn-out were evaluated with the use of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: The number of doctors enrolled in this study was 251 with a median age of 34; 51.4% were males. The percentage of doctors who had personal, work-related and patient-related burn-out were 62.2%, 52.2 % and 27.5%, respectively. The univariate analysis revealed a correlation between burn-out scores and cadre, age, sex, years of experience, marital status, weekly work hours and number of calls. After multiple regression, female gender (p=0.012), those with less than 6 years of work experience (p=0.004) and those working for at least 71 hours in a week (p=0.0001) remained correlated with higher burn-out scores. Additionally, physicians who had a person with COVID-19 in their immediate environment had an independent correlation with higher work-related burn-out scores (p=0.043). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of burn-out is high among Nigerian doctors and is linked to some sociodemographic, work-related and COVID-19-related factors. Due to the adverse effects of burn-out on physician well-being and patient care, strategies need to be put in place to identify and mitigate burn-out among Nigerian physicians.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "novel coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 280, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 299, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 595, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 703, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 927, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1004, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1260, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1764, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2014, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2107, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996233, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@2697049", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "species@9606"], "journal": "BMJ Open", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Pius RE", "Ajuluchukwu JN", "Roberts AA"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

This research explores the experiences of National Health Service (NHS) staff providing primary care for people seeking asylum, housed in contingency accommodation during COVID-19. This group often have LEP and face multiple additional barriers to healthcare access. Language discrimination is used as a theoretical framework. The potential utility of this concept is explored as a way of understanding and addressing inequities in care. DESIGN: Qualitative research using semistructured interviews and inductive thematic analysis. SETTING: An NHS primary care service for people seeking asylum based in contingency accommodation during COVID-19 housing superdiverse residents speaking a wide spectrum of languages. PARTICIPANTS: Ten staff including doctors, nurses, mental health practitioners, healthcare assistants and students participated in semistructured online interviews. Some staff were redeployed to this work due to the pandemic. RESULTS: All interviewees described patients' LEP as significant. Inadequate provision of interpretation services impacted the staff's ability to provide care and compromised patient safety. Discrimination, such as that based on migration status, was recognised and challenged by staff. However, inequity based on language was not articulated as discrimination. Instead, insufficient and substandard interpretation was accepted as the status quo and workarounds used, such as gesticulating or translation phone apps. The theoretical lens of language discrimination shows how this propagates existing social hierarchies and further disadvantages those with LEP. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides empirical evidence of how the inadequate provision of interpreters forces the hand of healthcare staff to use shortcuts. Although this innovative 'tinkering' allows staff to get the job done, it risks normalising structural gaps in care provision for people with LEP. Policy-makers must rethink their approach to interpretation provision which prioritises costs over quality. We assert that the concept of language discrimination is a valuable framework for clinicians to better identify and articulate unfair treatment on the grounds of LEP.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 273, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 489, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 555, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 957, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1021, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 1100, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1362, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1501, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 2274, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996230, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "BMJ Open", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Tomkow L", "Prager G", "Drinkwater J", "Morris RL", "Farrington R"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were shown effective to prevent severe COVID-19 for these patients. Nevertheless, concerns about the emergence of resistance mutations were raised. METHODS: We conducted a multicentric prospective cohort study, including 264 patients with mild-to moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 and treated early with Casirivimab/Imdevimab, Sotrovimab or Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab. We sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome during follow-up and searched for emerging Spike mutations. RESULTS: Immunocompromised patients have a 6-fold increased risk of developing mutations, which are associated with a prolonged duration of viral clearance but no clinical worsening. Emerging P337S/R/L/H, E340D/K/A/Q/V/G and K356T/R substitutions in patients treated with Sotrovimab are associated with higher viral RNA loads for up to 14 days post-treatment initiation. Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of developing mutations. R346K/I/T/S and K444R/N/M substitutions associated with Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab have been identified in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including BQ.1 and XBB. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the probability of emerging mutations arising in response to mAbs is significant, emphasizing the crucial need to investigate these mutations thoroughly and assess their impact on patients and the evolutionary trajectory of the SARS-CoV-2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 132, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 227, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 240, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 315, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 334, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 501, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 532, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 580, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 690, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 795, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "p.P337S,R,L,H", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "ProteinMutation", "originalIdentifier": "tmVar:p|SUB|P|337|S,R,L,H;HGVS:p.P337S,R,L,H;VariantGroup:0", "hgvs": "p.P337S,R,L,H"}, "text": "P337S/R/L/H", "locations": [{"offset": 960, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "p.E340D,K", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "ProteinMutation", "originalIdentifier": "tmVar:p|SUB|E|340|D,K;HGVS:p.E340D,K;VariantGroup:3", "hgvs": "p.E340D,K"}, "text": "E340D/K", "locations": [{"offset": 973, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "p.K356T", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "ProteinMutation", "originalIdentifier": "tmVar:p|SUB|K|356|T;HGVS:p.K356T;VariantGroup:2", "hgvs": "p.K356T"}, "text": "K356T", "locations": [{"offset": 993, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1018, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "p.R346K,I", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "ProteinMutation", "originalIdentifier": "tmVar:p|SUB|R|346|K,I;HGVS:p.R346K,I;VariantGroup:1", "hgvs": "p.R346K,I"}, "text": "R346K/I", "locations": [{"offset": 1230, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "p.K444R,N", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "ProteinMutation", "originalIdentifier": "tmVar:p|SUB|K|444|R,N;HGVS:p.K444R,N;VariantGroup:4", "hgvs": "p.K444R,N"}, "text": "K444R/N", "locations": [{"offset": 1246, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1342, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1595, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1643, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37996072, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "mutation@p.K444R,N", "disease@MESH:D003643", "species@2697049", "mutation@p.R346K,I", "mutation@p.E340D,K", "mutation@p.K356T", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "mutation@p.P337S,R,L,H"], "journal": "J Infect Dis", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Leducq V", "Zafilaza K", "Fauchois A", "Ghidaoui E", "Sayon S", "Dorival C", "Meledje ML", "Lusivika-Nzinga C", "Yordanov Y", "Martin-Blondel G", "Carrat F", "Marcelin AG", "Soulie C", "COCOPREV Study Group"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: We conducted an online survey among NYS residents and analyzed data from 1,012 adults and 246 children with diagnosed infection July 13-December 7, 2022. Weighted descriptive and logistic regression model analyses were conducted. Weighted percentages and prevalence ratios by test modality were generated. The percent of infections diagnosed by clinical tests via survey data were synthesized with daily lab-reported results to estimate the total number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections in NYS July 1-December 31, 2022. RESULTS: Over 70% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in NYS during the study period were diagnosed exclusively with home tests. Diagnosis with a clinical test was associated with age, race/ethnicity, and region among adults, and sex, age, and education among children. We estimate 4.1 million NYS residents had SARS-CoV-2 infection July 1-December 31, 2022, compared to 1.1 million infections reported over the same period.

While COVID-19 is principally a respiratory illness, it demonstrates significant gastrointestinal tropism, possibly predisposing to prolonged gut manifestations. We aimed to examine the long-term gastrointestinal impact of hospitalization with COVID-19. METHODS: Nested within a large-scale observational cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across North America, we performed a follow-up survey of 530 survivors 12-18 months later to assess for persistent GI symptoms and their severity, and for the development of disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Eligible patients were identified at the study site level and surveyed electronically. The survey instrument included the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire for Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction, a rating scale of 24 COVID-related symptoms, the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), and the Impact of Events-Revised (IES-R) trauma symptom questionnaire (a measure of post-traumatic stress associated with the illness experience). A regression analysis was performed to explore the factors associated with GI symptom severity at follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 530 invited patients, 116 responded (52.6% females; mean age 55.2 years), and 73 of those (60.3%) met criteria for one or more Rome IV DGBI at follow-up, higher than the prevalence in the US general population (p<0.0001). Among patients who experienced COVID-related GI symptoms during the index hospitalization (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), 42.1% retained at least one of these symptoms at follow up; in comparison, 89.8% of respondents retained any (GI or non-GI) COVID-related symptom. The number of moderate or severe GI symptoms experienced during the initial COVID-19 illness by self-report correlated with the development of DGBI and severity of GI symptoms at follow-up. Post-traumatic stress disorder (IES-R score > 33) related to the COVID-19 illness experience was identified in 41.4% of respondents and those individuals had higher DGBI prevalence and GI symptom severity. Regression analysis revealed that higher psychological trauma score (IES-R) was the strongest predictor of GI symptom severity at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this follow-up survey of patients 12-18 months after hospitalization with COVID-19, there was a high prevalence of DGBIs and persistent GI symptoms. Prolonged gastrointestinal manifestations were associated with the severity of GI symptoms during hospitalization and with the degree of psychological trauma related to the illness experience.",

Several groups have reported elevated levels of criteria and non-criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), assumed to cause APS, during acute or post-acute COVID-19. However, disease heterogeneity of COVID-19 is accompanied by heterogeneity in molecular signatures, including aberrant cytokine profiles and an increased occurrence of autoantibodies. Moreover, little is known about the association between autoantibodies and the clinical events. Here, we first aim to characterise the antiphospholipid antibody, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and the cytokine profiles in a diverse collective of COVID-19 patients (disease severity: asymptomatic to intensive care), using vaccinated individuals and influenza patients as comparisons. We then aim to assess whether the presence of aPL in COVID-19 is associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA microELISA and IgG, IgA, and IgM antiphospholipid line immunoassay (LIA) against 10 criteria and non-criteria antigens in 155 plasma samples of 124 individuals, and we measured 16 cytokines and chemokines in 112 plasma samples. We additionally employed clinical and demographic parameters to conduct multivariable regression analyses within multiple paradigms. In line with recent results, we find that IgM autoantibodies against annexin V (AnV), beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), and prothrombin (PT) are enriched upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. There was no evidence for seroconversion from IgM to IgG or IgA. PT, beta2GPI, and AnV IgM as well as cardiolipin (CL) IgG antiphospholipid levels were significantly elevated in the COVID-19 but not in the influenza or control groups. They were associated predominantly with the strength of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and the major correlate for thromboses was SARS-CoV-2 disease severity. CONCLUSION: While we have recapitulated previous findings, we conclude that the presence of the aPL, most notably PT, beta2GPI, AnV IgM, and CL IgG in COVID-19 are not associated with a higher incidence of thrombotic events.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 129,

Scientific investigations have validated the attributes of C. depressa, elucidating its valuable properties, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotion, hepatoprotection, and hypolipidemic effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to isolate a universal inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from C. depressa and confirm the mechanism by which these inhibitors disrupt the binding of the spike protein to hACE2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The whole fruit of C. depressa was subjected to ethanol extraction, following by partitioning to obtain water, butanol, and ethyl acetate fractions. To identify the inhibitory components in citrus fruits, we performed both the SPR assay and the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus assays. Subsequently, we employed a bioassay-guided approach to efficiently isolate and characterize the bioactive constituents that hindered the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2, using a combination of MPLC and Semi-preparative HPLC for compound isolation. ELISA based spike protein binding assay evaluate the inhibitory activities of the extract and potential constituents against multiple spike protein variants. To further shed light on the inhibitory mechanism, candidate inhibitors were validated through the SPR assay and molecular docking. RESULTS: The crude extract and ethyl acetate layer derived from C. depressa showed significant inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4/5, with IC50 of 77.4 mug/mL and 100 mug/mL, respectively. Ten potential compounds from C. depressa have been identified with inhibitory activity against various SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. 2'-hydroxy-4,4',5',6'-tetramethoxychalcone (Cd3) and 5-hydroxy-3',4',6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone (Cd8) also showed good inhibitory activity to the spike protein, with KD of 0.79 muM and 37.3 nM, respectively. These findings are in line with prior study, indicating Cd3 and Cd8 can bind to key amino acid residue, disrupting the formation of the spike protein and h-ACE2 complex. CONCLUSION: This study presents the initial evidence showcasing the inhibitory effect of polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of C. depressa extracts indicates their potential to prevent infections of different SARS-CoV-2 variants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "43", "infons":

Individually, the trials had limited power to detect a treatment effect due to recruitment stopping ahead of plan. Methods The statistical analysis plan for the meta-analysis was finalized before unblinding of PREVENT-HD, the larger of the two trials. Pooled risk ratios and pooled risk differences along with the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effect models. Findings Rivaroxaban did not reduce the occurrence of either the primary prespecified endpoint, a composite of symptomatic arterial and venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality (risk difference 0.0044, 95% confidence interval -0.0263, 0.0175; p=0.69 for pooled risk difference) or the secondary endpoint of all-cause hospitalization (p=0.76). Although thrombotic events were infrequent, pooled analysis did reveal that rivaroxaban reduced arterial and venous thrombotic events (placebo 6 events, rivaroxaban 0 events; pooled risk difference -0.0068, 95% confidence interval -0.0132, -0.0006; p=0.03). In the pooled studies, only one major bleeding event was observed in a rivaroxaban-allocated patient with no critical site or fatal bleeding events. Interpretation Although this meta-analysis does not support antithrombotic prophylaxis with rivaroxaban in a broad prehospital population with acute COVID-19, the prevention of arterial and venous thrombotic events among rivaroxaban-allocated patients is consistent with the known thromboprophylactic effect of the drug in medically ill patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 234, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 273, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 293, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006816", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "HD", "locations": [{"offset": 521, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 703, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D054556", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "venous thromboembolism", "locations": [{"offset": 830, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009203", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "myocardial infarction", "locations": [{"offset": 854, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002544", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "ischemic stroke", "locations": [{"offset": 877, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007511", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "acute limb ischemia", "locations": [{"offset": 894, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 955, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013927", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "thrombotic", "locations": [{"offset": 1140, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 1207, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020246", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "venous thrombotic", "locations": [{"offset": 1240, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 1284, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bleeding", "locations": [{"offset": 1427, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 1460, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1482, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bleeding", "locations": [{"offset": 1521, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "48", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 1630, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "49", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1687, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "50", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020246", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "venous thrombotic", "locations": [{"offset": 1728, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "51", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C503223", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "rivaroxaban", "locations": [{"offset": 1759, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "52", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1781, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "53", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1875, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995748, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D020246", "disease@MESH:D013927", "disease@MESH:D006470", "disease@MESH:D002544", "disease@MESH:D009203", "disease@MESH:D006816", "disease@MESH:D007511", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D054556", "chemical@MESH:C503223"], "journal": "Thromb Haemost", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Hsia J", "Spyropoulos AC", "Piazza G", "Weng S", "Dunne M", "Lipardi C", "Barnathan E", "Bonaca M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The existing data are mainly based on surveys. In addition to the problem of the accuracy of self-assessments, the pandemic per se and the massive public reporting may have biased the data.Only a few publications have compared data collected before the pandemic with results during the pandemic. The ELITE study has regularly monitored risk factors (RF) and psychosocial parameters (stress, depression, well-being, diet, brain performance, exercise) in over 5000 participants for years. From this study, data were analyzed from 1775 individuals collected before the onset and again during the pandemic (06/05/2020-25/01/2022). Thus, baseline values were unaffected by the pandemic. RESULTS:  As expected, both improvements and worsening of the collected parameters were found. Blood pressure and depressive symptoms worsened significantly more often, with women more frequently affected. Weight and stress levels also increased more often than they improved. Only physical activity showed a slight increase. 24.1 % showed only deteriorations and no improvements in these parameters. In contrast, 19.6 % showed improvements exclusively. In the group with only worsening, there was a significant increase in individuals with the risk factors (RF) hypertension, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol, nicotine, and diabetes mellitus.

However, traditional lecture-based oral health education has limitations, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile augmented reality (MAR) has emerged as an alternative educational method. This study compared the effectiveness of MAR-integrated oral health education with that of lecture-based education and no education. METHODS: This parallel, randomized controlled, open-label trial enrolled 75 older adults from six activity centers. The participants were randomly assigned, by a random number table technique, to the lecture-based, MAR, or control group. Data on oral healthcare-related knowledge, self-efficacy, and oral health status were collected through questionnaires and oral examinations at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at a 2-week follow-up. The MAR system's usability was assessed. Statistical analyses, comprising descriptive statistics and inferential tests, were performed. RESULTS: Data from 61 participants were analyzed, 22 in the lecture-based group, 20 in the MAR group, and 19 in the control group. Both lectures and MAR education significantly improved oral health status. However, changes in knowledge and self-efficacy scores were significantly different only for the MAR versus control group (p = .002 and .001, respectively). The MAR group demonstrated better knowledge and self-efficacy retention than did the lecture-based group, without significant difference. Usability assessment revealed potential for improvement in the MAR system. CONCLUSIONS: MAR-integrated oral health education enhanced the knowledge, self-efficacy, and oral health status of community-dwelling older adults. However, addressing technology adoption and usability challenges is vital. Longer-term evaluations and broader geographical studies are recommended.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 327, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 680, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1173, "length": 12}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995647, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Arch Gerontol Geriatr", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Romalee W", "Tsai FT", "Hsu YC", "Hsu ML", "Wang DH"]}

These latest subvariants have been shown to be somewhat resistant to the most common vaccines even with the third dose. Moreover, it has been well documented that when patients stop taking some commercial therapies (such as Paxlovid), COVID from these variants may return and may even be more contagious. Herein, we tested unfunctionalized and functionalized selenium (Se) nanoparticles with three novel peptides (NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK, NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK, and NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK) previously shown by themselves to passivate the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 BA.4, BA.5 and XBB variants. Se is a natural element in our diet and is well known to boost the immune system, thus, providing a complementary approach to viral infections. NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed a stronger inhibition ability at 98 % for Omicron BA.4 % and 96 % for Omicron BA.5 after just 15 min in vitro. Two types of Se nanoparticles (those made chemically or biogenically by cells) were tested to passivate the new SARS-CoV-2 XBB variant. Results showed that the combination of any peptide and using either type of Se NP, the Omicron subvariant XBB was inhibited by 100 % after just 15 min in vitro. Interestingly, the use of Se NPs alone outperformed the peptides in terms of XBB passivation. Also, in order to determine a mechanism of action, functionalizing Se nanoparticles with the NapFFSAVLQSGFKKKK peptide showed a high binding ability toward the chemotrypsin-like cysteine protease (SARS CoV-2 3CLpro). Further, as a demonstration of their versatility, these functionalized peptides also passivated the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK and NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK showed in silico interactions with the fusion glycoprotein of RSV prompting in vitro RSV pseudo virus testing. Compared to the conventionally precipitated synthetic Se nanoparticles, in vitro results showed that biogenic Se functionalized with the peptides enhanced the inhibition RSV to 100 % after just 15 min of incubation. NapFFTLUFLTUTEKKKK and NapFFMLUFLMUMEKKKK also showed no potential genotoxicity or carcinogenic effects. The peptides showed good gastro-intestinal (GI) tract absorption and bioavailability as predicted using the partition coefficient (QP logPo/w), and high-water solubility as detected by QPlogS.

A secondary aim was to explore how and how much healthcare facilities support HCWs to implement IPC practices. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and September 2021 in Southern Italy using a self-administered questionnaire. Socio-demographic and professional characteristics, COVID-19 preparedness and response plan in the facilities, knowledge about COVID-19's transmission and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), concerns about the possibility of transmitting COVID-19 to family members and patients, adherence to IPC practices, and sources of information were investigated. RESULTS: Among the 492 enrolled HCWs, the overall knowledge median score was 6 out of a maximum score of 8 and predictors of good knowledge were practicing in a facility that organized training courses about IPC measures and having more years in practice. HCWs were more concerned about the possibility of transmitting the infection to their family members (64.4%) than to negative patients (38.9%). A sizable proportion claimed to take off the face mask by touching only the straps or ties (76.3%) and to replace the face mask when it was wet (70.7%).

Studies examining SAD in managing COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia (SA) are limited. This study examined the discrimination and inequality in treating COVID-19 patients and the associated beliefs among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study using an online self-administrated questionnaire by 414 HCWs from September 2022 to January 2023. RESULTS: Of the 414 participants, 53.4% aged 18-30 years, were males (53.4%), mostly Saudi (82.1%), and residents of western SA (90.8%). Almost one-third of the participants (32.1%) were physicians, and 23.7% were pharmacists. 53.1% of the HCWs had work experience < 5 years, 49.3% either had a current/previous COVID-19 infection and 10.1% (n = 42) reported treating >= 2000 COVID-19 patients. Most of the participants had not received training on avoiding discrimination against COVID-19 patients (n = 246; 59.4%) and denied receiving any incentives from their institution (n = 294; 71%) or community (n = 248; 59.9%) during the pandemic. Less than 20% of the HCWs had observed some sort of discrimination in providing care for COVID-19 patients. The responses significantly differed by nationality, educational level, specialty, workplace and COVID-19 infection status (P < 0.05). Approximately, 20% of the participants held negative beliefs about COVID-19 patients and these responses varied significantly by nationality, work experience, workplace, gender, and age (p < 0.05). Cross-tabulation and regression analyses showed some differences by gender, workplace, specialty and COVID-19 infection status.

Therefore, we aimed to compare the population-adjusted incidence of febrile seizures(FS) and epilepsy before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea and to assess the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the incidence by region and age group. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using nationwide claims data and covid data from January 2019 to December 2020. The incidence of diseases and difference in incidence before (Jan 20 to Dec 30, 2019) and after (Jan 20 to Dec 30, 2020) the COVID-19 outbreak was measured using rate ratio. An Interrupted time series analysis was used to identify the effect of COVID-19 on trends of FS and epilepsy. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, insurance, and risk of coronavirus by area were conducted. RESULTS: Following the onset of the pandemic, the number of newly diagnosed FS cases decreased sharply by 69 % (24,182 to 7238), whereas the incidence of epilepsy, increased to 1.02 times (30,286-29,312), when adjusted in proportion to the population. Notably, a greater decrease in the incidence of FS were found in the regions with high-risk of coronavirus. A result of segmented regression analysis proved the decrease was significant and made immediately after the pandemic started(p < 0.001). In contrast to the incidence of FS, that of epilepsy did not exhibit a significant month-to-month change during the baseline period, immediately after the pandemic started, and during the pandemic.

This study aimed to examine the impact of pandemic-control measures on surrogates' fertility, pregnancy and birthing experiences. METHODS: Sampling frame included eligible surrogates who were actively involved in a surrogacy process at an academic IVF centre during the pandemic (03/2020 to 02/2022). Data were collected between 29/04/2022 and 31/07/2022 using an anonymous 85-item online survey that included twelve open-ended questions. Free-text comments were analysed by thematic analysis. FINDINGS: The response rate was 50.7% (338/667). Of the 320 completed surveys used for analysis, 609 comments were collected from 206 respondents. Twelve main themes and thirty-six sub-themes grouped under 'vaccination', 'fertility treatment', 'pregnancy care', and 'surrogacy birth' were identified. Three in five surrogates found the control measures highly or moderately affected their surrogacy experiences. Themes involving loneliness and isolation frequently emerged when essential surrogacy support was restricted by the visitor protocols implemented at healthcare facilities. DISCUSSION: Our findings show that restricting or limiting intended parents' in-person involvement increased surrogates' feelings of isolation and made the overall surrogacy experience less rewarding and fulfilling.

We characterize the humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with MM before and after receiving the bivalent booster, including neutralizing assays to identify patterns associated with continuing vulnerability to current variants (XBB1.16, EG5) in the current post-pandemic era. METHODS: We studied the humoral and cellular immune responses before and after bivalent booster immunization in 48 MM patients. Spike binding IgG antibody levels were measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike binding ELISA and neutralization capacity was assessed by a SARS-CoV-2 multi-cycle microneutralization assays to assess inhibition of live virus. We measured spike specific T-cell function using the QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 (Qiagen) assay as well as flow-cytometry based T-cell. In a subset of 38 patients, high-dimensional flow cytometry was performed to identify immune cell subsets associated with lack of humoral antibodies. FINDINGS: We find that bivalent vaccination provides significant boost in protection to the omicron variant in our MM patients, in a treatment specific manner. MM patients remain vulnerable to newer variants with mutations in the spike portion. Anti-CD38 and anti-BCMA therapies affect the immune machinery needed to produce antibodies. INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights varying immune responses observed in MM patients after receiving bivalent COVID-19 vaccination. Specifically, a subgroup of MM patients undergoing anti-CD38 and anti-BCMA therapy experience impairment in immune cells such DCs, B cells, NK cells and TFH cells, leading to an inability to generate adequate humoral and cellular responses to vaccination.

The majority (90%) were non-Hispanic ethnicity, 5% were Hispanic, and 4% were missing ethnicity data. Black patients were more likely to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status >= 2 (p-value = 0.04).

METHOD: We studied 347 patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) living in nine Latin American countries between May 2021 and July 2022, including 70 premenopausal, 48 perimenopausal, and 229 postmenopausal women. We compared the sociodemographic and general health information of women with (n = 164) and without (n = 183) the long-COVID-19 syndrome. They also completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Jenkins Sleep Scale, and the Menopause Rating Scale to define the minimum set of variables for adjustment. We designed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to identify factors related to the long-COVID-19 syndrome. Data were submitted to categorical logistic regression analyses. Results are reported as means and standard deviations or beta-coefficients and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: Women with long-COVID-19 syndrome had a poor lifestyle, severe menopause symptoms, hypertension, insomnia, depression, anxiety, chronic diseases/conditions, risk of hospitalization, sleep disturbance, and low menopause-related quality of life compared to women without the syndrome. The DAG identified the following long-COVID-19 covariates: age, obesity, anxiety, depression, cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and menstrual status. A multivariable logistic model with these covariates indicated that anxiety is the only factor to be significantly associated with long-COVID-19 syndrome, whereas other covariates were confounding factors. There was no significant influence of menopausal status on the long-COVID-19 syndrome. CONCLUSION: Among factors selected by the DAG, only anxiety was significantly associated with the long-COVID-19.

METHODS: A microsimulation model was created with individual-level data and daily cycles, with a 1-year time horizon, to compare the current scenario of standard care with a scenario in which nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is offered to the population. Adults of any age group that received >=2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine formed the investigated population. Direct medical costs of the outpatients and inpatients admitted to the ward or intensive care unit were included. The effectiveness of the model was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: In all simulations, the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir resulted in incremental costs per patient of US dollar (USD)245.86 and incremental effectiveness of 0.009 QALY, over a year. The incremental cost-utility ratio was USD27 220.70/QALY. The relative risk of the vaccinated population was the factor that affected the outcome most, according to the univariate sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in 100% of the simulations being more costly and effective, but that only 4% of them were below the established cost-effectiveness threshold of USD24 000.00/QALY. In the scenario considering only the population over 60 years old and immunosuppressed (of any age), the incremental cost-utility ratio was USD7589.37/QALY.

The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 causes liver injury is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to describe the hepatic pathology in a large cohort of deceased patients with COVID-19 as compared to a control group of deceased patients without COVID-19. METHODS: Consented autopsy cases at two institutions were searched for documentation of COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death. A group of consecutive consented autopsy cases during the same period, negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, was used as a control group. The autopsy report and electronic medical records were reviewed for relevant clinicopathologic information. H&E-stained liver sections from both groups were examined for pertinent histologic features. Select cases underwent immunohistochemical staining for CD 68 and ACE2 and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assay for evaluation of SARS-CoV2 RNA. RESULTS: 48 COVID-19 positive patients (median age 73, M:F 3:1) and 40 COVID-19 negative control patients (median age 67.5, M:F 1.4:1) were included in the study. The COVID-19 positive group was significantly older and had a lower rate of alcoholism and malignancy, but there was no difference in other comorbidities. The COVID-19 positive group was more likely to have received steroids (75.6 % vs. 36.1 %, p < 0.001). Hepatic vascular changes were seen in a minority (10.6 %) of COVID-19 positive cases. When all patients were included, there were no significant histopathologic differences between groups, but when patients with chronic alcoholism were excluded, the COVID-19 positive group was significantly more likely to have steatosis (80.9 % vs. 50.0 %, p = 0.004) and lobular inflammation (45.7 % vs. 20.7 %, p = 0.03). Testing for viral RNA by ddPCR identified 2 of the 18 (11.1 %) COVID-19 positive cases to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected within the liver FFPE tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant findings in the liver of COVID-19 positive patients were mild lobular inflammation and steatosis. The high rate of steroid therapy in this population may be a possible source of steatosis. Hepatic vascular alterations were only identified in a minority of patients and did not appear to play a predominant role in COVID-19 mediated hepatic injury. Low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in liver tissue in our cohort suggests hepatic injury in the setting of COVID-19 may be secondary in nature.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "53",

The need for WGS was driven in part by the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, which necessitated measuring variation along the entire genome sequence to effectively differentiate lineages and characterize viral evolution. Several WGS approaches designed to maximize throughput and accuracy were quickly adopted by surveillance labs around the world. These broad-based SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing efforts revealed ongoing evolution of the virus, highlighted by the successive emergence of new viral variants throughout the course of the pandemic. These genomic insights were instrumental in characterizing the effects of viral mutations on transmissibility, immune escape and viral tropism, which in turn helped guide public health policy, the use of monoclonal antibody therapeutics and vaccine development strategies. As the use of direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 became more widespread, the potential for emergence of antiviral resistance has driven ongoing efforts to delineate resistance mutations and to monitor global sequence databases for their emergence.

As part of the community-based antiviral and therapeutic treatment pathway for COVID-19 there has been a move from PCR testing in those eligible to a rapid antigen lateral flow testing regime. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a multi-day lateral flow device (LFD) testing regime is a feasible alternative to PCR for diagnosing symptomatic patients eligible for COVID-19 treatments. An LFD regime might return a positive result more quickly than a PCR and hence expedite access to COVID-19 treatments. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 with a combination of PCR and LFDs of symptomatic patients eligible for COVID-19 treatments. LFD testing patterns were not assigned. Patients self-censored and the patterns were retro-fitted to the observed results. RESULTS: The LFD testing patterns offered high sensitivity, close to 92%; however, the false positive rate also increased, with most of the multi-day testing patterns having a false positive rate greater than 3%. The highest sensitivity was seen among patients who tested with LFD on the same day as PCR. CONCLUSIONS: There were multiple observed testing behaviours. We conclude that multi-day LFD testing for COVID-19 provides a feasible alternative to PCR to in eligible patients, allowing swift prescription of COVID-19 treatments in most cases. This approach requires acceptance of a trade-off for a small increase in false-positive and -negative results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 154, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 243, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 390, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 650, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 672, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 791, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 886, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "LFDs", "locations": [{"offset": 927, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 947, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 969, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1030, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1365, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1523, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1586, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1627, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995356, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "species@2697049", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Antimicrob Chemother", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Fowler T", "Fellows A", "MacISaac R", "Kolade O", "Singh B", "Eccles A", "Blandford E", "Tunkel SA"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: A narrative review of relevant major medical countermeasure trials was conducted using the date range February 2020-December 2022, representing the period of greatest productivity in research to investigate COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the most influential trial designs are the adaptive platform designs, which have been applied to the development of initial COVID-19 antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, repurposing of existing immunomodulatory therapy and assisted in the disproof of ineffective medical therapies. Some of the most prominent examples include the REMAP-CAP, RECOVERY and TOGETHER trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive platform trial designs hold great promise for utility in future pandemics and mass casualty events. Additionally, public-private sectoring is essential for rapid medical countermeasure development and should be further enhanced for future biopreparedness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 86, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 156, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 968, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1194, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1343, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995353, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Antimicrob Chemother", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Harris GH", "Adalja AA"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

AIMS: The primary objective of this study is to describe a system where HBOH services were adapted to provide a monitoring programme whereby HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 received daily evaluations and treatment options in order to improve access to care, and to report the clinical outcomes and predictors of hospitalization in HCWs enrolled in the programme. A secondary objective is to compare clinical outcomes to data on national HCWs with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used survey data collected on HCWs at a university health system with COVID-19 from 1 March 2020 through 1 December 2021. A firth regression model was used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted association between clinical factors and hospitalization. RESULTS: The study cohort included 4814 HCWs with COVID-19. Overall hospitalizations were 119 (2%), and there were six deaths (0.12%). Predictors of hospitalization include several co-morbidities and symptoms. A total of 1835 HCWs monitored before vaccine or monoclonal antibody availability were compared with data on U.S. HCWs in a similar time period. The monitored HCWs had a lower rate of co-morbidities (19% versus 44%, P < 0.001), a lower hospitalization rate (3% versus 8% P < 0.001) and case-fatality rate (0.11% versus 0.95% P < 0.001).

METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases, MEDLINE and Embase, from January 2019 until February 2022. We included studies that evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in activities and settings, deemed strategically important to government departments in Ireland, provided by the Department of Health (Ireland) Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Testing. RESULTS: After screening 14 052 records, data from 139 studies were narratively synthesized. The risk was consistently reported as 'high' for large social events (e.g. weddings) and indoor sports, working in healthcare settings and shared workplaces, working/living in residential settings and travelling via public transportation. Most studies were from healthcare settings, with common risk factors including close contact with COVID-19 cases, working in high-risk departments and inappropriate use of personal protective equipment. For other settings and activities, lack of infection prevention and control practices reportedly contributed to infection transmission.

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 856 participants took place in January 2022, excluding workers, such as physicians and nurses from the CMN SXXI, disabled workers, staff with a union agreement, support staff and/or staff with less than one year of work labour. Through a self-administered questionnaire, the degree of occupational exposure to patients care with COVID-19, a history of COVID-19 infection, and the patient's health quiz were asked (PHQ-9). The analysis included simple frequency measurements, odds ratio (OR), Chi squared and multiple logistics regression with p <= 0.05. Results: The prevalence of depression in the medical and nursing staff at CMN SXXI was 32.2% (moderate to severe degree); In the multiple regression, an association was identified with not identifying support by the Institute (OR: 1.60, CI95%: 1.08-2.39, p = 0.02), high occupational exposure (OR: 8.35, CI95%: 3.02-23.09, p   0.0001), and more than 5 working days a week serving the COVID-19 patients (OR: 2.51, CI95%: 1.35-4.49, p = 0.004) and as a protective factor the fact that they have never had the COVID-19 (OR: 0.61, CI95%: 0.43-0.86, p = 0.01).

The aim of this paper is to examine how the Peruvian government responded to the health and food needs of the Shawi and Ashaninka Indigenous peoples of Peru during the first 18 months of the pandemic (March 2020-August 2021). This study uses both official policy documents and real-world experiences to evaluate policy responses in terms of their immediate impact and their longer-term sustainability and contribution to the improvement of health, well-being and justice for Indigenous communities. Four health and food security responses were evaluated: the Amazon Health Plan and Indigenous Command; food aid; cash aid; and COVID-19 vaccination. We employed the Multidimensional Injustice Framework to analyse the justice implications of the design and implementation of responses. Data collection included 71 interviews with government officials (n = 7), Indigenous leaders (n = 31) and community members (n = 33). The results show how national and regional governments released policies to address the health and food needs of Indigenous peoples directly or indirectly, as part of a broader focus on vulnerable people. However, justice implications were not sufficiently addressed in the design or implementation of the responses. On the distributive dimension, Indigenous communities were prioritized to receive health goods and services, nevertheless, the distribution had shortcomings that impeded their collection and Indigenous food systems and livelihoods were largely overlooked. On the procedural dimension, Indigenous representatives were included to provide culturally sensitive feedback on health interventions, but without funding, and furthermore, the community members had only passive participation. This paper points out the importance of considering and addressing justice implications for more effective and fairer health and food policy responses to current and future health crises.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 161, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "peoples", "locations": [{"offset": 258, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "peoples", "locations": [{"offset": 542, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1027, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "peoples", "locations": [{"offset": 1443, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 1516, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995268, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700929898829}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Health Policy Plan", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Chicmana-Zapata V", "Arotoma-Rojas I", "Anza-Ram&#xed;rez C", "Ford J", "Galappaththi EK", "Pickering K", "Sacks E", "Togarepi C", "Perera CD", "van Bavel B", "Hyams K", "Akugre FA", "Nkalubo J", "Dharmasiri I", "Nakwafila O", "Mensah A", "Miranda JJ", "Zavaleta-Cortijo C"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

We aimed to explore the implementation of mental health regulations adopted by the Peruvian health system by focusing on the care services at Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), based on the experiences of health workers. We conducted a phenomenological qualitative study to understand the implementation of mental health policies launched in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained from a document review of 15 national policy measures implemented during the pandemic (March 2020 to September 2021), and 20 interviews with health workers from CMHCs (September 2021 to February 2022). The analysis was conducted using thematic content analysis. Most implemented policies adapted CMHC care services to a virtual modality during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, various challenges and barriers were evidenced in the process, which prevented effective adaptation of services. Workers perceived that ineffective telemedicine use was attributed to a gap in access to technology at the CMHCs and also by users, ranging from limited access to technological devices to a lack of technological skills. Further, although mental health promotion and prevention policies targeting the community were proposed, CMHC staff reported temporary interruption of these services during the first wave.

Prior to initiation of large-scale clinical trials, robust preclinical data to support candidate plausibility are required. This work sought to further investigate the putative antiviral activity of probenecid against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Vero E6 cells were preincubated with probenecid, or control media for 2 h before infection (SARS-CoV-2/Human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020). Probenecid or control media was reapplied, plates reincubated and cytopathic activity quantified by spectrophotometry after 48 h. In vitro human airway epithelial cell (HAEC) assays were performed for probenecid against SARS-CoV-2-VoC-B.1.1.7 (hCoV-19/Belgium/rega-12211513/2020; EPI_ISL_791333, 2020-12-21) using an optimized cell model for antiviral testing. Syrian golden hamsters were intranasally inoculated (SARS-CoV-2 Delta B.1.617.2) 24 h prior to treatment with probenecid or vehicle for four twice-daily doses. RESULTS: No observable antiviral activity for probenecid was evident in Vero E6 or HAEC assays. No reduction in total or subgenomic RNA was observed in terminal lung samples (P > 0.05) from hamsters. Body weight of uninfected hamsters remained stable whereas both probenecid- and vehicle-treated infected hamsters lost body weight (P > 0.5).

Virtual care includes synchronous or asynchronous delivery of health care services through video visits, telephone visits, or secure messaging. Patient advisors are people with patient and caregiving experiences who collaborate within the health care system to share insights and experiences in order to improve health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand patient advisors' perceptions related to virtual care and potential impacts on health care quality. METHODS: We adopted a phenomenological approach, whereby we interviewed 20 participants who were patient advisors across Canada using a semistructured interview protocol. The protocol was developed by content experts and medical education researchers. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. Data collection stopped once thematic saturation was reached. The study was conducted at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. We recruited 20 participants from 5 Canadian provinces (17 female participants and 3 male participants). RESULTS: Six themes were identified: (1) characteristics of effective health care, (2) experiences with virtual care, (3) modality preferences, (4) involvement of others, (5) risks associated with virtual care encounters, and (6) vulnerable populations. Participants reported that high-quality health care included building relationships and treating patients holistically. In general, participants described positive experiences with virtual care during the pandemic, including greater efficiency, increased accessibility, and that virtual care was less stressful and more patient centered. Participants comparing virtual care with in-person care reported that time, scheduling, and content of interactions were similar across modalities. However, participants also shared the perception that certain modalities were more appropriate for specific clinical encounters (eg, prescription renewals and follow-up appointments). Perspectives related to the involvement of family members and medical trainees were positive. Potential risks included miscommunication, privacy concerns, and inaccurate patient assessments. All participants agreed that stakeholders should be proactive in applying strategies to support vulnerable patients. Participants also recommended education for patients and providers to improve virtual care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Participant-reported experiences of virtual care encounters were relatively positive. Future work could focus on delivering training and resources for providers and patients. While initial experiences are positive, there is a need for ongoing stakeholder engagement and evaluation to improve patient and caregiver experiences with virtual care.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 181, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patient", "locations": [{"offset": 465, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 486, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 498, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 688, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 863, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 885, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1269, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1319, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1343, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1612, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1709, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1744, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1932, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1950, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 2107, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2452, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 2477, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2580, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 2590, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2634, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participant", "locations": [{"offset": 2704, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2869, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2996, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37995127, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Med Internet Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Braund H", "Dalgarno N", "Chan-Nguyen S", "Digby G", "Haji F", "O'Riordan A", "Appireddy R"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Caring for older adults involves performing diverse activities, resulting in reduced free time and tiredness, and fulfilling the demands and expectations related to personal, family, physical, and social life, consequently compromising the quality of life of the caregiver. In this context, the informal caregiver of hospitalized older adults emerges as the focus of attention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the sociodemographic profile, health conditions, and burden of informal caregivers of older adults admitted to a university hospital in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic period. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study that was conducted with 25 informal caregivers of hospitalized older adults in a university hospital in Brazil between August and September 2022. Three instruments were applied: Caregiver Burden Inventory, sociodemographic questionnaire, and health conditions questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 28.0. Descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential analyses were performed using 2-sided Student t test with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 25 interviewees, 18 (72%) were females, 17 (46%) were married or in a stable union, 14 (56%) completed secondary education, and 11 (44%) lived with the older adults who needed care. The average age of the participants was 44 (SD 12.8) years. Regarding their health conditions, most caregivers self-reported it as good (12/25, 48%). They provided care to their father or mother older than 70 years (14/25, 56%). The Caregiver Burden Inventory analysis showed that the caregivers were the most negatively impacted in the domains of personal life overload (mean 10.8, SD 3.46; P=.047) and physical overload (mean 10.6, SD 2.32; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, there has been an increase in the burden on informal caregivers of hospitalized older adults in Brazil, thereby impacting their personal and physical lives.

OBJECTIVE: This study protocol describes the planning and management of a survey to investigate the persistent or changing trends in knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, vaccination, and nonpharmaceutical preventive measures among COVID-19 cases' household contacts aged 18 years and older, after the acute phase of the pandemic in Catalonia and Navarre in Spain. The secondary objectives include investigating the rate of secondary transmission in households, taking into account the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, and preventive measures toward COVID-19. METHODS: A telephone questionnaire was designed to assess the changing trends in knowledge, preventive measures, and attitudes toward COVID-19 in 3 rounds (after identification as a household contact, 3 months later, and 6 months later). The questionnaire was developed following an extensive literature review and through discussions with a panel of experts who designed and assessed the validity of the questionnaire in terms of relevance, consistency, completeness, and clarity. The questionnaire consists of the following 7 sections: social and demographic characteristics (ie, gender, age, educational level, and workplace), comorbidities and risk factors (according to the recommendations from the COVID-19 vaccination strategy), epidemiological data (ie, exposure time, relationship with index cases, and frequency of use of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures), COVID-19 vaccination status (ie, the number and date of doses received), knowledge and attitudes toward COVID-19 (assessed using a 5-point Likert scale-totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and totally disagree), and sources of information (including traditional mass media, social media, and official sources). RESULTS: A pilot study was performed in May 2022 to evaluate the questionnaire with 22 household contacts. Preliminary findings indicated that the questionnaire was feasible and acceptable in the general population. The average response time was 15 minutes, with greater variations in responses by older participants. After the pilot study, recruitment of participants began and is expected to be completed at the end of the year 2023, after which the final results will be available in 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2 and the relaxation of containment measures, the implementation of the survey during the postacute phase will provide valuable insight to assist public health decision-making and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, thereby attenuating the negative effects of COVID-19 at individual and population level.

At the time of that report, virologic assessments from the trial were partially incomplete as a result of their time-intensive nature. Here we present final results from all prespecified virology endpoints in MOVe-OUT based on the full trial dataset. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline (day 1, prior to first dose) and days 3, 5 (end-of-treatment visit), 10, 15, and 29. From these samples, change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers (determined by quantitative PCR), detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 (by plaque assay), and SARS-CoV-2 viral error induction (determined by whole genome next-generation sequencing) were assessed as exploratory endpoints. RESULTS: Molnupiravir was associated with greater mean reductions from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA than placebo (including 50% relative reduction at end-of-treatment) through day 10. Among participants with infectious virus detected at baseline (n = 96 molnupiravir, n = 97 placebo) and evaluable post-baseline samples, no molnupiravir-treated participant had infectious SARS-CoV-2 by day 3, whereas infectious virus was recovered from 21% of placebo-arm participants on day 3 and 2% at end-of-treatment. Consistent with molnupiravir's mechanism of action, sequence analysis demonstrated that molnupiravir was associated with an increased number of low-frequency transition errors randomly distributed across the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome compared with placebo (median 143.5 molnupiravir, 15 placebo), while transversion errors were infrequent overall (median 2 in both arms). Outcomes were consistent regardless of baseline SARS-CoV-2 clade, presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response, or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-day course of orally administered molnupiravir demonstrated a consistently greater virologic effect than placebo, including rapidly eliminating infectious SARS-CoV-2, in high-risk outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Understanding the specific consumer products and settings coded in the NEISS dictionary that contribute to geriatric (>= 65 years) ocular injuries, along with changing patterns during events like the COVID-19 pandemic, provides crucial insights for tailoring therapy and preventative strategies. This ultimately may reduce the burden of eye injuries on both older adults and healthcare systems. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study. The NEISS database was used to study eye injuries in geriatric adults from 2010 to 2021. Patients were categorized by age groups (65-74, 75-84, 85-94,  >= 95 years), and data on demographics, injury types, product categories, and COVID-19 impact were collected. Pearson's chi-squared test (with p < 0.001 taken to indicate significance) was used to assess differences in expected ratios between age groups. RESULTS: A total of 168,685 eye injury cases in adults aged 65 years and older were analyzed. Household items, tools, and gardening products accounted for over 75% of injuries. Most injuries occurred at home (65.3%). Contusions/abrasions (40.3%) and a foreign body (19.3%) were common diagnoses. Females had more household-item-related injuries, while males had more foreign body injuries. Regarding therapeutic disposition, 93.7% of all injuries were treated/examined and released, which showed a decreasing trend as age increased, while hospital admission/transfer rates increased with age. Compared to before COVID-19, the percentage of injuries during COVID-19 due to tools decreased (from 22.5% to 18.3%), while injuries due to gardening/lawn/landscaping/patio products increased (from 13.8% to 15.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study characterizes geriatric ocular injuries and COVID-19 impact, highlighting common products and locations. Different age groups showed different injury patterns. Understanding these trends can aid injury prevention strategies for consumers and healthcare providers. Demographics and injury frequencies differed based on age and sex.

We aimed at assessing whether HFNC is associated with reduced risk of intubation or mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 compared with conventional oxygen therapy (COT). METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing HFNC vs. COT in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, published in English from inception to December 2022. Pediatric studies, studies that compared HFNC with a noninvasive respiratory support other than COT and those in which intubation or mortality were not reported were excluded. Two authors independently screened and selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis were performed according to statistical heterogeneity. Primary outcomes were risk of intubation and mortality across RCTs. Effect estimates were calculated as risk ratios and 95% confidence interval (RR; 95% CI). Observational studies were used for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Twenty studies were analyzed, accounting for 8383 patients, including 6 RCTs (2509 patients) and 14 observational studies (5874 patients). By pooling the 6 RCTs, HFNC compared with COT significantly reduced the risk of intubation (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98; p = 0.02) and reduced length of stay in hospital. HFNC did not significantly reduce the risk of mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; p = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, HFNC reduced the need for intubation and shortened length of stay in hospital without significant decreased risk of mortality.

The hypothesis is that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had an impact on the care of older adults with proximal femoral fractures due to resource scarcity, regardless of whether or not the patient was infected. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed the data of 87 hospitals which entered 15,289 patients in the Geriatric Trauma Register (\"AltersTraumaRegister DGU \", ATR-DGU) in Germany in 2019 and 2020. In this study we analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the inpatient treatment of hip fractures as well as the mid-term follow-up during the first 120 days. For the main analysis, we compared patients documented during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (April-December) with a control group in 2019 (April-December). Additionally, we performed a subgroup analysis of the periods with high COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020 a total of 11,669 patients (2020: n = 6002 patients vs. 2019: n = 5667 patients) were included in this study. Only minor differences were found between the patients treated during the pandemic; however, when the COVID-19 incidence in Germany was greater than 50/100,000 residents, significantly fewer patients (p < 0.001) were discharged to a geriatric rehabilitation ward (27.2% vs. 36.3%) and an increased mortality rate during inpatient treatment was determined (8.4% vs. 4.6%) (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The healthcare system was able to respond to the pandemic and patients' clinical courses were not impaired as long as the incidences were low. Nevertheless, the healthcare system reached its limits in times of higher incidence, which was also directly reflected in the patient outcome, mortality and place of discharge.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 145, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 240, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005264", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "femoral fractures", "locations": [{"offset": 322, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 399, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 411, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 509, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C035593", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "ATR-DGU", "locations": [{"offset": 581, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 666, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006620", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hip fractures", "locations": [{"offset": 714, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 824, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 855, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1017, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1092, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1117, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1145, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1230, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1286, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1375, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1482, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1642, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1849, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1866, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994922, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D005264", "disease@MESH:D014947", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003643", "chemical@MESH:C035593", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D006620"], "journal": "Unfallchirurgie (Heidelb)", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Knauf T", "Eschbach D", "B&#xfc;cking B", "Knobe M", "Rascher K", "Schoeneberg C", "Bliemel C", "Ruchholtz S", "Aigner R", "B&#xf6;keler U", "Arbeitskreis AltersTraumaRegister der Deutschen Gesellschaft f&#xfc;r Unfallchirurgie (DGU)"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise the global evidence on SARS-CoV-2 reinfections in the pre-Omicron era. Methods: We searched five global databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, WHO COVID-19) on 12 May 2022 and 28 July 2023 and three Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, CQvip) on 16 October 2022 for articles reporting incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection before the period of Omicron (B.1.1.529) predominance. We assessed risk of bias using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools and conducted meta-analyses with random effects models to estimate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among initially infected cases and hospitalisation and mortality proportions among reinfected ones. Results: We identified 7593 studies and extracted data from 64 included ones representing 21 countries. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was 1.16% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.33) based on 11 639 247 initially infected cases, with >=45 days between the two infections. Healthcare providers (2.28%; 95% CI = 1.37-3.40) had a significantly higher risk of reinfection than the general population (1.00%; 95% CI = 0.81-1.20), while young adults aged 18 to 35 years (1.01%; 95% CI = 0.8-1.25) had a higher reinfection burden than other age groups (children <18 years old: 0.57%; 95% CI = 0.39-0.79, older adults aged 36-65 years old: 0.53%; 95% CI = 0.41-0.65, elderly >65 years old: 0.37%; 95% CI = 0.15-0.66). Among the reinfected cases, 8.12% (95% CI = 5.30-11.39) were hospitalised, 1.31% (95% CI = 0.29-2.83) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 0.71% (95% CI = 0.02-2.01) died. Conclusions: Our data suggest a relatively low risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the pre-Omicron era, but the risk of hospitalisation was relatively high among the reinfected cases.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients who were hospitalized in the ICUs due to COVID-19 between March 11, 2022, 08.00 am, and March 12, 2022, 08.00 am, were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, intensive care and laboratory data, radiological characteristics, and follow-up results of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 811 patients from 59 centers were included in the study, 59% of the cases were male, and the mean age was 74 +- 14 years. At least one comorbid disease was present in 94% of the cases, and hypertension was the most common. When ICU weight scores were examined, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II: 19 (15-27) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 7 (4-10) were seen. Sepsis was present in 37% (n = 298) of cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratios of the patients were 190 the highest and 150 the lowest and 51% of the cases were followed via invasive mechanical ventilation. On the study day, 73% bilateral involvement was seen on chest x-ray, and ground-glass opacities (52%) were the most common on chest tomography. There was growth in culture in 40% (n = 318) of the cases, and the most common growth was in the tracheal aspirate (42%). CONCLUSION: The clinical course of COVID-19 is variable, and ICU follow-up was required due to advanced age, comorbidity, presence of respiratory symptoms, and widespread radiological involvement. The need for respiratory support and the presence of secondary infection are important issues to be considered in the follow-up. Despite the end of the second year of the pandemic and vaccination, the high severity of the disease as well as the need for follow-up in ICUs has shown that COVID-19 is an important health problem.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 304, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 330, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 458, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 508, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 733, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 781, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 966, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D018805", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Sepsis", "locations": [{"offset": 1161, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011478", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PaO2", "locations": [{"offset": 1207, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C570661", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "FiO2", "locations": [{"offset": 1212, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1231, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1653, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012818", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1752, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1878, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2102, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994835, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "chemical@MESH:D011478", "chemical@MESH:C570661", "disease@MESH:D006973", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D012818", "disease@MESH:D018805", "species@9606"], "journal": "Thorac Res Pract", "year": 2023, "authors": ["G&#xfc;ng&#xf6;r S", "Edibo&#x11f;lu &#xd6;", "Yaz&#x131;c&#x131;o&#x11f;lu Mo&#xe7;in &#xd6;", "Ad&#x131;g&#xfc;zel N", "Tuncay E", "Ekiz &#x130;&#x15f;canl&#x131; &#x130;G", "Er B", "Karakurt Z", "Turan S", "Kosoval&#x131; BD", "Mutlu NM", "Kayar D", "G&#xf6;kbulut Bekta&#x15f; &#x15e;", "Uysal E", "Se&#x11f;men F", "Alp G", "Erdem D", "Has Selmi N", "G&#xfc;ven P", "&#xd6;z&#xe7;elik Z", "Ocakc&#x131;o&#x11f;lu M", "Yaz&#x131;c&#x131; &#xd6;zg&#xfc;r C", "Y&#x131;lmaz R", "Bilgi &#xd6;zel D", "Cebeci H", "G&#xfc;ler B", "Cansever C", "&#xc7;ak&#x131;rca M", "&#x130;nce&#xf6;z H", "Solmaz &#x130;", "&#xd6;zkan Sipahio&#x11f;lu F", "Ayd&#x131;n EM", "Dayan&#x131;r H", "&#xd6;ner SF", "Karatepe U", "&#xd6;zen S", "Boran M", "Erg&#xfc;l DF", "Kasapo&#x11f;lu US", "Delen LA", "Toy E", "Altun K", "Albayrak T", "Yanal H", "Zaim G", "Yarar V", "K&#x131;l&#x131;n&#xe7; G", "Deniz M", "&#xd6;zdemir E", "Soylu VG", "Y&#x131;lmaz A", "Sayg&#x131;l&#x131; SM", "&#xd6;zt&#xfc;rk EK", "Ergan B", "Ey&#xfc;po&#x11f;lu S", "&#x15e;ahin Y", "Y&#xfc;ksel B", "Bulut A", "Sar&#x131;ta&#x15f; A", "Yeniay H", "Gen&#xe7; M", "Karg&#x131;n F", "&#xd6;zcan O", "Karako&#xe7; E", "Karaca &#xdc;", "S&#xf6;z&#xfc;tek D", "Sar&#x131; S", "&#x15e;eno&#x11f;lu N", "Ayg&#xfc;n H", "Yi&#x11f;it AC", "Kavruk N", "Uzan &#xc7;A", "B&#x131;&#xe7;akc&#x131;o&#x11f;lu M", "Solak S", "Kutbay &#xd6;z&#xe7;elik H", "Ulu&#xe7; K", "Y&#x131;ld&#x131;r&#x131;m &#x130;", "Arar MC", "Demirel &#x130;", "K&#xfc;ver SU", "&#xd6;zg&#xfc;r ES", "Ayd&#x131;n K", "Erdal D&#xf6;nmez G", "Aygencel G", "Esmao&#x11f;lu A", "Sebil Ayd&#x131;n B", "Tokur ME", "Korkmaz Ekren P", "Aydemir Y", "&#xc7;ak&#x131;r G&#xfc;ney B", "Erdil &#xd6;Y", "T&#xfc;nay A", "Bahad&#x131;r T", "U&#xe7;kun S", "Kocao&#x11f;lu N", "P&#x131;nar HU", "Kutluer Karaca N", "G&#xfc;ltekin H", "Ayvat P", "Belin &#xd6;zer A", "Ero&#x11f;lu A", "Kuyrukluy&#x131;ld&#x131;z U", "Baytar &#xc7;", "Ayo&#x11f;lu H", "M&#x131;zrak&#xe7;&#x131; S", "Metin H", "Zanbak Mutlu &#xd6;P", "Y&#x131;lmaz H", "T&#xfc;z&#xfc;ner F"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

In response, the development of nanozymes is actively underway; they have advantages in stability, cost, performance, and functionalization over natural enzymes commonly used for signal amplification in sensing technologies. However, the performance of nanozymes is interdependent with factors such as shape, size, and surface functional moiety, making it challenging to perform quantitative performance comparisons based on the nanozyme material. In this study, we propose a physical synthetic approach to fabricate double-layered bimetallic nanozymes with identical shapes, sizes, and surfaces but different material compositions. These Janus nanozymes consist of a nanozymatic layer responsible for catalytic activity and a gold layer responsible for quantification and efficient surface modification. Based on their identical physicochemical properties, the synthesized double-layered bimetallic nanozymes allow, for the first time, a quantitative comparison of nanozymatic activities in terms of various kinetic parameters. We compared several candidates and found that the Ir-Au nanozyme exhibited the best performance. Subsequently, we applied this nanozyme to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 based on a surrogate virus neutralization test. The results demonstrated a limit of detection as low as 2 pg/mL and selectivity specifically toward MERS-CoV. The performance of this assay was further validated using vaccinated samples, demonstrating the potential of our approach as a cost-effective, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic tool for neutralizing antibody detection against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007495", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Ir-Au", "locations": [{"offset": 1330, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1458, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "1335626", "type": "Species"}, "text": "MERS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 1617, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1867, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994824, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@1335626", "species@2697049", "chemical@MESH:D007495"], "journal": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Kwak SH", "Jeong DG", "Shon HK", "Kim DH", "Lee TG", "Wi JS", "Na HK"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

OBJECTIVE: Here, we identify factors influencing vaccination decisions of patients at Turtle Creek Primary Care clinic in Turtle Creek, PA, a racially-diverse borough. DESIGN: A retrospective mixed-methods study of the predominantly non-white patient population at Turtle Creek Primary Care clinic, a clinic caring for >70% minority patients. RESULTS: Fourteen factors emerged that patients reported were crucial to vaccine decision-making. Of these factors, top reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were trust in vaccines, vaccine side effects, perceived vaccine knowledge, and faith/religion. Top reasons for influenza vaccine hesitancy were perceived need, vaccine side effects, trust in vaccines, and habitual behaviors. We also uncovered correlations between vaccine decision factors and sociodemographic factors. Participants > 65-years-old were more likely to cite personal safety in choosing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, while non-white participants were more likely to cite others' safety. Participants > 65-years-old were also more likely to cite personal safety in influenza vaccine decision-making, and non-female participants were more likely to cite perceived need for influenza vaccines.

Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They are normally harmless or even helpful. However under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease. Infectious diseases are also called contagious diseases due to the fact that they can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by insects or other animals. COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has \"pervaded\" the whole world during the last three years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods: In this paper, we will study the outbreak of this pandemic in Albania based on some mathematical models, such as SIR, SIRD, and SEIRD. We will present a detailed analysis of these models and also demonstrate how they can be used to predict the spread of infectious diseases. More precisely, we will see the spread of COVID-19 in our country, Albania. Software such as MATLAB and RStudio will be used to do this. The data that we will use when working with these programs is taken from the Institute of Public Health, Tirana, Albania. Results: We've developed an application utilizing actual data to estimate SEIRD model parameters. It's able to compute the basic reproduction number and, more significantly, provides forecasts on the disease's progression. Conclusions: Our aim is to calculate the Basic Reproduction Number, using the Next Generation Matrix, and use it to see the future of the disease. This is the average number of new infections generated by an infected individual. A large value indicates that the infection is transmitted very quickly.

Finding a potent and secure medication candidate to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and its symptoms is still an urgent global need. After reviewing previous studies, olive leaves, being rich in polyphenolic compounds (a large class of bioactive substances naturally found in plants), were proposed as a viable co-therapy supplement to treat and improve clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It has long been known that olive tree polyphenols-such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, verbascoside, as well as triterpenoids like maslinic, ursolic, and oleanolic acids-have anti-inflammatory and multitarget antiviral effects on several virus families, and they could be one of the reasons of the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet against COVID-19. Thus, olive tree poly-phenols were tested in silico and in vitro for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, claiming that they have beneficial effects. Nevertheless, there is still a small number of research studies on this topic.

The aim of the study was to explore any relationship between joint/epidural CS injection and SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients 18 years or over who received at least one joint or epidural CS injection by physiatrists in a tertiary care center between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This cohort of patients was then compared to a control group who did not receive any CS injection during this time period. RESULTS: A total of 766 patients were identified in the CS injection group and 1546 patients in the control group. Overall, 12.27% of patients turned SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive in the CS injection group, which was similar to 11.90% in the control group (p = 0.797). But 3-month SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate showed a statistically significant higher rate among the CS injection group (3.30% in the CS injection group vs. 2.10% in the control group; p = 0.027). In multivariate regression analysis, after adjusting both groups for Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), there was statistically significant higher SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate in the CS injection group (p = 0.024). However, after adjusting both groups for age and total number of comorbidities, there was no difference between the groups in regard to SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate (p = 0.081). In the subgroup analysis of only COVID-19 vaccinated patients, there was an increased 3-month SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate among patients with severe comorbidities in the CS injection group (p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: The study was not conclusive on the effect of joint or epidural CS injection on SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate, although adjusted analysis suggests higher 3-month SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate after CS injection in patients with severe comorbidities with significant disease burden when compared to controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000305", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "corticosteroid", "locations": [{"offset": 142, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 214, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 240, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 353, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "locations": [{"offset": 365, "length": 47}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 513, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 701, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 833, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 893, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 943, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 959, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1084, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1414, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1620, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1697, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1717, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1758, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1795, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1961, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 2044, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2097, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994676, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "species@2697049", "species@9606", "chemical@MESH:D000305"], "journal": "Pain Pract", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Raju R", "Holder EK", "Dundas M", "Liang J", "Donham R"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

RESULTS: Qualitative data revealed themes of (1) awareness; (2) responsibility; (3) perspectives on school meals; and (4) new opportunities. Most (81%) foodservice directors believed HSMFA should continue post-pandemic. HSMFA would cost $51,341,436 to $82,358,375 per year. IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY, PRACTICE, AND EQUITY: HSMFA would result in the equitable treatment of all children regarding access to healthy school meals. CONCLUSIONS: Given the support of foodservice directors but the lack of political consensus, considering stepwise implementation and providing cost estimates may increase feasibility of a HSMFA policy in Utah.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 168, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 221, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Child", "locations": [{"offset": 577, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010698", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY", "locations": [{"offset": 1062, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1159, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994552, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D010698", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Sch Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Spruance LA", "Guenther PM", "Callaway S", "Giles L", "Varas S", "Metos J"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

This has been recently emphasized by the approval of Onpattro  and COVID-19 vaccines. PEGylation is known to provide lipid-based nanocarriers with stealth properties, but it also leads to reduced cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and to the production of anti-PEG antibodies causing accelerated blood clearance (ABC) and hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). This work highlights the great potential of amphiphilic poly(N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide) (PNMVA) derivatives as alternatives to lipid-PEG for post-insertion into lipoplexes and pre-insertion into LNPs designed for siRNA delivery. PNMVA compounds with different degrees of polymerization and hydrophobic segments, such as octadecyl and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), were synthesized. Among them, DSPE-PNMVA efficiently integrated into lipoplex and LNP membranes and prevented protein corona formation around these lipid carriers, exhibiting stealth properties comparable to DSPE-PEG. However, unlike DSPE-PEG, DSPE-PNMVA24 showed no adverse impact on lipoplexes cell uptake and endosomal escape. In in vivo study with mice, DSPE-PNMVA24 lipoplexes demonstrated no liver accumulation, indicating good stealth properties, extended circulation time after a second dose, reduced immunological reaction, and no systemic pro-inflammatory response. Safety of DSPE-PNMVA24 was confirmed at the cellular level and in animal models of zebrafish and mice. Overall, DSPE-PNMVA is an advantageous substitute to DSPE-PEG for siRNA delivery, offering comparable stealth and toxicity properties while improving efficacy of the lipid-based carriers by minimizing the dilemma effect and reducing immunological reactions, meaning no ABC or HSR effects.

Often seen as a simple operation associated with low complication rates, it still leads to lengthy hospitalizations. Reducing postoperative complications and ileus rates could lead to a shorter length of stay and even ambulatory surgery. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of ileostomy closure performed in a 23-hour hospitalization setting using a standardized enhanced recovery pathway. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS: Two high-volume colorectal surgery centers. PATIENTS: Healthy adults undergoing elective ileostomy closure, from July 2019 to January 2022. INTERVENTION: All patients were enrolled in a standardized enhanced recovery pathway specific to ileostomy closure including daily irrigation of efferent limb with a nutritional formula for 7 days prior to surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to either conventional hospitalization (n = 23) or a 23-hour stay (n = 24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was total length of stay and secondary outcomes were 30-day rates of readmission, postoperative ileus, surgical site infections, postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were ultimately randomized. Patients in the 23-hour hospitalization arm had a shorter median length of stay (1 day vs. 2 days, p = 0.02) and similar rates of readmission (4% vs. 13%, p = 0.35), postoperative ileus (none in both arms), surgical site infection (0 vs. 4%, p = 0.49), postoperative morbidity (21% vs. 22%, p = 1.00) and mortality (none in both arms). LIMITATIONS: Due to COVID-19, access to surgical beds was greatly limited, leading to a shift toward ambulatory surgery for ileostomy closure. The study was terminated early, which affected its statistical power. CONCLUSION: Loop ileostomy closures as 23-hour stay procedures are feasible and safe. Ileus rate might be reduced by preoperative intestinal stimulation with nutritional formula through stoma's efferent limb, although specific RCTs are needed to confirm this association.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PATIENTS", "locations": [{"offset": 726, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 840, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1037, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 1302, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1342, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1376, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1413, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1634, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1718, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1769, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994456, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D007239"], "journal": "Dis Colon Rectum", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Charbonneau J", "Morin G", "Par&#xe9; X", "Frigault J", "Drolet S", "Bouchard A", "Rouleau-Fournier F", "Bouchard P", "Thibault C", "Letarte F"]}

Biomarkers can aid in the diagnosis, prediction, intervention, and outcome assessment of AKI. This study aimed to summarize the current research status and identify research hotspots for AKI biomarkers using bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Relevant original English language articles were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection database, from inception to 31 December 2022. Full records and related cited references from all the documents were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 16368 authors from 3379 institutions in 83 countries/regions contributed to 2916 documents that were published in 712 academic journals. Annual publication output followed exponential growth since 2008. The United States, the University of Pittsburgh, and the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology were the most productive countries, institutions, and journals in terms of research outputs, respectively. The area of interest has shifted from neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cell cycle, and tubular damage toward sepsis and COVID-19. Apoptosis, inflammation, and chronic kidney disease have become popular in recent years, and studies on ferroptosis, machine learning, COVID-19, and renal fibrosis will be the focus of future research. IMPLICATIONS: This bibliometric study suggests that future research on AKI biomarkers would focus on ferroptosis, renal fibrosis and COVID-19.

Wary of recommending personalization as the blueprint for setting a social contagion health campaign in motion, we probed further to understand the influence of individual-level variables on the communicability of personalized messages.

Flu symptoms due to influenza A strain, H1N1, were initially discovered in 2009. This variant of influenza A is believed to have emerged through reassortment, a process where the resulting virus inherits gene segments from each of its parental viruses. This reassortment event has resulted in a variant with altered characteristics, potentially affecting the level of immunity in humans. The symptoms of this strain typically manifest 1-4 days after exposure and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, body aches, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. The transmission dynamics of this new variant, including human-to-human transmission, are still under investigation by health authorities. Individuals with weakened immune systems are generally more susceptible to severe illness. Risk factors associated with swine flu can include older adults, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with obesity. Historical variants of swine flu, such as the 2015 variant in India, have been associated with significant case numbers and deaths, often due to respiratory failure. Since the epidemic of Covid-19 due to SARS-CoV2 in early 2020, several symptoms of COVID-19 and swine flu overlap.

Methods: Among 11,231 adult Virus Watch Community Cohort Study participants multivariable logistic regressions were used to estimate the relationships between deprivation and self-reported activities and deprivation and infection (self-reported lateral flow or PCR tests and linkage to National Testing data and Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS)) between August - December 2021, following the lifting of national public health restrictions. Results: Those living in areas of greatest deprivation were more likely to undertake essential activities (leaving home for work (aOR 1.56 (1.33 - 1.83)), using public transport (aOR 1.33 (1.13 - 1.57)) but less likely to undertake non-essential activities (indoor hospitality (aOR 0.82 (0.70 - 0.96)), outdoor hospitality (aOR 0.56 (0.48 - 0.66)), indoor leisure (aOR 0.63 (0.54 - 0.74)), outdoor leisure (aOR 0.64 (0.46 - 0.88)), or visit a hairdresser (aOR 0.72 (0.61 - 0.85))).

For some doctoral researchers, however, the pandemic has also been accompanied by political unrest and military conflict, putting them and their networks at risk and making their research especially difficult to sustain. Methods: We have used a collaborative auto-ethnography, and we, a group of seven doctoral researchers based in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sudan and UK have written our experiences. Results: Drawing upon the results of a collaborative auto-ethnography (CAE), this article records and discusses the experiences of a group of doctoral researchers who with the support of their organisation, the Social Science for Severe Stigmatised Skin Diseases (5S) Foundation, have been attempting to cope with both the pandemic and internal instability and strife. After firstly setting the context, the article explains why for the purposes of this paper CAE was adopted as our method, and then documents and discusses the experiences of seven doctoral researchers based in Ethiopia, Sudan, Rwanda, and the UK, doing so in terms of four different themes: New Ways of Working and Its Impact, Change and Delay, Mental Health and Well-Being Impact, and Qualities and Capacities. Conclusion: What these experiences tell us is that this group of doctoral researchers have found themselves in extremely challenging situations, which have placed exceptionally high demands on them and their support networks, and this has had an impact on their health and well-being although also been the catalyst for some more positive development. Given their lived experiences, the article finishes with a series of recommendations for future research projects of this kind.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C024336", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Sudan", "locations": [{"offset": 667, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012871", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Skin Diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 959, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C024336", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Sudan", "locations": [{"offset": 1299, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994318, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D012871", "chemical@MESH:C024336"], "journal": "NIHR Open Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Bikorimana JP", "Thellmann C", "Mulugeta T", "Wonde D", "Tsegaye A", "Ali Bashir Alnoor Ahmed B", "Bayisenge U", "Pocock J"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

This paper describes the development and evaluation of an innovation utilising TEL to enhance our core curriculum content and students' learning. APPROACH: The curriculum-linked media (CLM) was introduced as a part of a doctoring and clinical skills course for pre-clinical medical students as a structured curriculum that pairs audio and/or video-based content with reflection prompts designed to prime students for active, in-person learning upon arrival to their classrooms. The CLM aimed to help students (1) gain a deeper understanding of the course content, (2) partake in reflective practice and (3) explore diverse perspectives on a particular topic. EVALUATION: All students completed a survey at the end of their academic year to evaluate the activity. Some students found the innovation helpful in that it facilitated perspective taking and prepared them for their in-person class. The reflection questions that paired with the media prompted discussion in class and a deeper connection with the materials. Making the content relevant to the local community and highlighting regional issues made the activity more relatable. IMPLICATIONS: Our experience demonstrated that the CLM model can be a helpful and efficient tool to stretch the educational reach of the classroom. Future applications may consider the implementation and evaluation of the model with clinical students and postgraduate trainees.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 52, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994251, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Clin Teach", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Alroumi F", "Belforti R", "Villarroel N", "Blanchard RD"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 852 community-dwelling older adults in Hokkaido and Tokyo, Japan were surveyed conducted between April and November 2021 using convenience sampling. The Lubben social network scale-6, frailty screening index, and geriatric depression scale were used to assess social isolation, frailty and depression, respectively. A path analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of social isolation on frailty. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 76.8 +- 6.6 years. Overall, 46% and 59% of participants were socially isolated before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Frailty was found in 19% of participants during the pandemic. Friends and family connectedness before the pandemic had no direct relationship with frailty; only friend connectedness affected frailty indirectly via depression. Family connectedness during the pandemic had a significant, negative and direct relationship with frailty. CONCLUSION: The findings show that connectedness with family and friends is critical for older people's physical and mental health. IMPACT: Nurses in the community should consider these findings to reduce mental health problems and physical decline among older adults. It is important to identify older adults who are socially isolated from their families or friends and provide resources to help them build relationships within their communities.

DESIGN, SETTING: Online cross-sectional survey (1-31 May 2022); respondents were participants recruited by snowball sampling for TRANSform, an Australian longitudinal survey-based trans health study, 1 May - 30 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: People aged 16 years or older, currently living in Australia, and with a gender different to their sex recorded at birth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of respondents who reported disruptions to gender-affirming health care, COVID-19 illness, testing, and vaccination, and positive and negative experiences during health care. RESULTS: Of 875 people invited, 516 provided valid survey responses (59%). Their median age was 33 years (interquartile range, 26-45 years); 193 identified as women or trans women (37%), 185 as men or trans men (36%), and 138 as non-binary (27%). Of 448 respondents receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy, 230 (49%) reported disruptions to treatment during the pandemic; booked gender-affirming surgery had been cancelled or postponed for 37 of 85 respondents (44%). Trans-related discrimination during health care was reported by a larger proportion of participants than in a pre-pandemic survey (56% v 26%). COVID-19 was reported by 132 respondents (26%), of whom 49 reported health consequences three months or more after the acute illness (37%; estimated Australian rate: 5-10%). Three or more COVID-19 vaccine doses were reported by 448 participants (87%; Australian adult rate: 70%).

METHODS: In 2020, nurses returning from their deployment to COVID-19 treatment units were invited to complete the Professional Quality of Life Survey and gather for debrief sessions, referred to as campfires, in which semistructured questions about their experiences were administered among clinical nurses and nurse leaders. Employing a mixed methods design, the authors conducted descriptive statistics for survey responses and inductive thematic analysis to identify emergent themes from open-ended questions. RESULTS: A total of 19 campfires were held with 278 nurse participants. Of the 278 participants, 220 completed surveys. Of these, 194 (88%) represented 30 nurse leaders and 164 staff nurses. The majority of surveyed nurses in both groups reported compassion satisfaction despite reporting moderate levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Qualitative themes from campfires with clinical nurses and nurse leaders revealed similarities, such as concern for safety and lack of choices and transparency, although each group faced unique challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Findings related to post deployment and adverse psychological health suggest that a trauma-informed approach (ie, staff autonomy, physical and psychological safety, transparency, offering choices, leveraging voices, and collaboration) by leaders could enhance a culture of wellness, build resilience, and mitigate empathic burnout and also proactively and strategically thinking about preventive measures for future catastrophic events.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 111, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005221", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fatigue", "locations": [{"offset": 204, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 487, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 998, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1023, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000068376", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "secondary traumatic stress", "locations": [{"offset": 1260, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014947", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "trauma", "locations": [{"offset": 1591, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37994032, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D000068376", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D005221", "disease@MESH:D014947", "species@9606"], "journal": "Perm J", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Lewis-O'Connor A", "Linzer PB", "Goldstein E"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

This study aimed to assess one such method, dual oxygenation, i.e., the addition of a reservoir mask (RM) on top of a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the records of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during 2020-2022 were reviewed. Patients over the age of 18 years with hypoxemia necessitating HFNC were included. Exclusion criteria were positive-pressure-ventilation for any indication other than hypoxemic respiratory failure, transfer to another facility while still on HFNC and \"do-not-intubate/resuscitate\" orders. The primary outcome was mortality within 30 days from the first application of HFNC. Secondary outcomes were intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. Results: Of 659 patients included in the final analysis, 316 were treated with dual oxygenation and 343 with HFNC alone. Propensity for treatment was estimated based on background diagnoses, laboratories and vital signs upon admission, gender and glucocorticoid dose. Inverse probability of treatment weighted regression including age, body mass index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and respiratory rate oxygenation index showed treatment with dual oxygenation to be associated with lower 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.615; 95% confidence interval, 0.469-0.809).

Electronic cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) is a cost-effective and evidence-based treatment for anxiety and depression that can be accessed remotely. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of online psychotherapy tailored to depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: The pilot study used a pre-post design to evaluate the efficacy of a 9-week e-CBT program designed for individuals with depression and anxiety affected by the pandemic. Participants were adults (n = 59) diagnosed with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder, whose mental health symptoms initiated or worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online psychotherapy program focused on teaching coping, mindfulness, and problem-solving skills. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, resilience, and quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.023) and depression (p = 0.029) after the intervention. Similar trends were observed in the intent-to-treat analysis. No significant differences were observed in resilience and quality of life measures. The sample comprised mostly females, making it challenging to discern the benefits of the intervention in males. Although a pre-post design is less rigorous than a controlled trial, this design was selected to observe changes in scores during a critical period. CONCLUSIONS: e-CBT for COVID-19 is an effective and accessible treatment option. Improvements in clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression can be observed in individuals whose mental health is affected by COVID-19. CLINICALTRIAL: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04476667.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to multiple emergent adjustments in training schedules to accommodate increasing needs in patient care. The physician training period, in itself, has been consistently shown to be associated with vulnerability with respect to mental well-being. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the experience of IM trainees is not well established. OBJECTIVE: Characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trainee clinical education, finances, and well-being. METHODS: We developed a survey composed of 25 multiple choice questions, 6 of which had an optional short-answer component. The survey was distributed by the American College of Physicians (ACP) to 23,289 IM residents and subspecialty fellows. We received 1,128 complete surveys and an additional 269 partially completed surveys. RESULTS: The majority of respondents reported a disruption in their clinical schedule (76%) and a decrease in both didactic conferences (71%) and protected time for education (56%). A majority of respondents (81%) reported an impact on their well-being with an increase in their level of burnout and 41% of respondents reported a decrease in level of direct supervision. Despite these changes, the majority of trainee respondents (78%) felt well prepared for clinical practice after graduation. CONCLUSIONS: These results outline the vulnerable position of internal medicine physicians in training. Preserving educational experiences, adequate supervision, and humane work hours are essential in protecting trainees from mental illness and burnout during global emergencies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 292, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 408, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 581, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 699, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002908", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mental illness", "locations": [{"offset": 1825, "length": 14}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993947, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D002908"], "journal": "BMC Health Serv Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["St-Pierre F", "Petrosyan R", "Gupta A", "Hughes S", "Trickett J", "Read S", "Van Doren V", "Zeveney A", "Shoushtari C"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

It has been reported that the SARS-CoV-2 RiboNucleic Acid (RNA) cannot be detected in follicular fluid and granulosa cells. However, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in immature oocytes and blastocysts has still unknown. Moreover, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on embryological outcomes in ART during the Omicron epidemic is limited. METHODS: A prospective study was performed to explore the detection rate of viral RNA in biological specimens from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on embryological outcomes. A total of 211 patients underwent transvaginal oocyte retrieval at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between December 13, 2022 and December 30, 2022. Prior to transvaginal oocyte retrieval, 61 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within 24 h. Follicular fluid was preserved during oocyte retrieval. Granular cells were collected after degranulation (Intracytoplasmic sperm injection only). Immature oocytes were collected at the end of the ICSI. Unavailable blastocysts were collected on day 6 (D6). The TIANLONG SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-Kit was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all samples. The COVID-19 and Non COVID-19 groups were contrasted in the following areas: fertilization rate, 2PN rate, Day 3 (D3) available embryos rate, D3 good-quality embryos rate, blastocyst formation rate, good-quality blastocyst formation rate. RESULTS: All samples were negative except for an immature oocytes sample that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA with a detection rate of 6.67%. Whether in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the rate of fertilization, 2PN, D3 available embryos, D3 good-quality embryos, blastocyst formation, good-quality blastocyst formation was not significantly negative different between the COVID-19 and the Non COVID-19 groups. Our findings were validated by an overview of the embryological outcome from the cycles before SARS- Cov-2 infection from the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: Except for immature oocytes, none of the follicular fluid, granulosa cells, or blastocysts samples contained viral RNA.

In Hungary, education has been relegated to the online space, with a substantial proportion of students having to attend medical secondments. Increased stress, uncertainty, and the presence of medical secondments can have an impact on students' premature burnout. METHODS: In 2021, we conducted a follow-up survey among students of the University of Pecs studying medicine and health sciences in two data collection periods (from March to May and September to November). Our online questionnaire consisted of the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey for Students and our self-designed questionnaire. We used descriptive and paired two-sample t-tests for data analysis at a 95% confidence interval (p <= 0.05). RESULTS: We excluded from our survey respondents whose data we could not follow-up; finally, 183 students' responses were analyzed. The majority of students were female (n = 148; 80.9%). Overall, there was a significant decrease in both exhaustion (EX) and cynicism (CY) scores (p = 0.001; p = 0.004). Female respondents had higher EX scores, but a significant decrease was observed for both genders (p <= 0.05). Excluding paramedic students, a significant decrease in EX scores was observed for the specialties we studied (p <= 0.05). General medicine students' CY scores decreased; physiotherapy students' profesisonal efficacy (PE) scores increased significantly (p <= 0.05). Students who were on medical secondments (n = 127; 69. 4%) were found to be more affected by burnout, but in all cases, these scores significantly improved (p <= 0.05). Students serving in the National Ambulance Service (n = 76; 41.5%), Hospitals (n = 44; 24.0%), or both (n = 7; 3.8%) had a significant decrease in their burnout score (p <= 0.05). Students who served in either a hospital or a hospital and National Ambulance Service had significantly improved CY and PE scores (p <= 0.05). Students concerned about their health had elevated EX and CY scores, which also improved (p <= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, medical secondments positively affected student burnout scores for medicine and health sciences students at our institution. This fact implies that it is necessary to have more internships in real-life settings during the training.

METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from children admitted for asthma exacerbation to Chengdu Women and Children's Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2022. Rates of hospitalization, ages of the affected children, comorbidities and infections, and relationships between hospitalization and seasonal or environmental factors were examined before and after the epidemic. RESULTS: Fewer children were hospitalized for asthma exacerbation, yet more hospitalized children had severe exacerbation after the epidemic than before. Rates of hospitalization varied considerably with time of year, and the timing of peak hospitalizations differed before and after the epidemic. Only before the epidemic, rates of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation were positively correlated with humidity. Infants made up a smaller proportion of hospitalized children after the epidemic than before, with preschool children accounting for most hospitalizations after the epidemic. The proportion of children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation who also had pneumonia was significantly smaller after the epidemic than before.

The advantages and disadvantages of online education have been studied in Japan; however, the educational outcome of online classes conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been completely evaluated. In this study, we examined the relationship between lecture format (e.g., face-to-face or online) and performance of third-year university students in their organ-specific cardiovascular course examination. METHODS: This retrospective, nonclinical, and noninterventional comparative educational study included 550 third-year medical students who took a cardiovascular course between April 2018 and May 2022. Cardiovascular coursework was conducted in-person in 2018 and 2019, online in 2020 and 2021, and again in-person in 2022. The course comprised 62 lecture and 2 problem-based learning (PBL) sessions. A quiz was set up in advance on Moodle based on all lectures conducted in 2021 and 2022. A written examination was administered at the end of the course to evaluate the knowledge of students. The student online course evaluation questionnaires were administered in 2020 and 2021. Examination scores and proportion of failures in each year were compared. RESULTS: The mean examination scores were significantly higher in 2021 and 2022 than in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for the class type, online quiz, and PBL revealed that only online quiz was significantly associated with better examination results (p < 0.05). A student course evaluation survey indicated that the online format did not interfere with the students' learning and was beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of online classes into medical education due to the COVID-19 pandemic was as effective as face-to-face classes owing to learning management system and other innovations, such as online quizzes.

As a widely used drug in the treatment of COVID-19, whether glucocorticoids may accelerate the clearance of COVID-19 is still not clear, and the glucocorticoids may improve the prognosis of patients is also controversial. Therefore, to explore the relationship between COVID-19 viral load and the use of glucocorticoids we designed this study. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the emergency department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from the end of 2022 to early 2023 were enrolled in this study. Characteristics of baseline, clinical and laboratory evaluation especially immunological indicator and daily viral load were carefully collected. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test and proportional-hazards model (Cox model) were chosen as appropriate for comparison of variables. RESULTS: By comparing the daily COVID-19 viral load and prognosis of patients with and without glucocorticoid therapy, we found that glucocorticoids did not statistically enhance the clearance or replication of COVID-19, nor did it change the 28-days and in-hospital mortality. However, glucocorticoid therapy may be a favorable factor for COVID-19 negative conversion in Cox model. The inflammatory factors in patients with glucocorticoid therapy were significantly decreased.

METHODS: From June 2018 to February 2023, we consecutively enrolled 19 children with tension pneumomediastinum in our institution. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the anterior mediastinum by a CT imaging-guided parasternal approach. The catheter was connected to a negative-pressure water seal bottle to drain the pneumomediastinum. Clinical data and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS: The mean age was 3.1 +- 3.4 years, the mean weight was 15 +- 9.1 kg, the mean procedure time was 11.8 +- 2.4 min, and the drainage time was 6.7 +- 3.4 days. No major complications were identified, such as haemothorax, catheter displacement, or mediastinal infection. Effective drainage was obtained in all patients as assessed by comparing images and ventilatory parameters, and no additional surgical treatment was needed. There was no recurrence during the follow-up, which was more than 2 months.

This study aimed to determine the factors that affected COVID-19 prevention behaviors (CPB) based on constructs of Social Cognition Theory (SCT). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 426 participants referred to health centers of Arak from October 2021 to February 2022, and they were selected through a multi-stage random sampling method. Data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire which includes socio-demographic data (6 items), COVID-19 prevention behaviors (12 items), and SCT constructs related to COVID-19 (32 items). SPSS Ver-16 statistical software was used to analyze the data with one-way ANOVA, independent samples t-test, and multiple linear regressions. The significance level of alpha = 0.05 was considered for all tests. RESULTS: The mean age was 37.8 years (SD = 12.2) and ranged from 17 to 81. According to the results, 51.2% had higher education and 52.6% of the participants were female. The mean (SD) of COVID-19 preventive behaviors was 43 (SD = 7.8) out of 60. There was statistical association between CPB and three constructs of SCT. Multiple regression showed that the outcomes expectations (beta = 0.11, p < 0.001), self-regulation (beta = 0.41, p < 0.001), and self-efficacy (beta = 0.30, p < 0.001), age, gender, and history of COVID 19infection were associated with CPB and those described 61% of the variance of CPB. CONCLUSION: Rendering to the result of this study constructs of SCT is the key predictor of participants' CPB.

RESULTS: Prevalence of both airway diseases varied markedly by region, making meaningful pooled global estimates of prevalence invalid and not of clinical utility. For individual studies, the interquartile range for asthma prevalence was 4.21 to 12.39%, and for COPD, 3.82 to 11.85%. The relative risk of death with COPD for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was 1.863 (95% CI 1.640-2.115), while the risk with asthma was 0.918 (95% CI 0.767 to 1.098) with no evidence of increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: For asthma and COPD, prevalence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 varies markedly by region. We found no evidence that asthma predisposed to increased mortality in COVID-19 disease. For COPD, there was clear evidence of an association with increased mortality.

The infection is especially deadly in vulnerable populations. The current studies indicate that pregnant women are at greater risk of getting seriously ill. Even though fetuses protect against disease, the additional finding showed that the COVID-19 pandemic could increase fetal and maternal morbidities. In a situation where COVID-19 and new strains of the virus are still not controlled, scientists predicted that the world might experience another pandemic. Consequently, more research about the effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy outcomes is needed. This study aimed to compare the pregnancy outcomes of Iranian pregnant women in the first year of the pandemic with the previous year. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was performed to compare the pregnancy outcome during the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranian pregnant women who gave birth during the pandemic and one year before the pandemic (2019-2020 and 2020-2021). The sample size was 2,371,332 births registered at hospitals and birth centers platforms. The studied variables include stillbirth, congenital anomaly, birth weight, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, ICU admission, mean of the gestational age at birth, preterm births, NICU admission, neonatal mortality and the percentage of deliveries with at least one complication such as blood transfusion and postpartum ICU admission. Analyzing data was done by using SPSS version 25 software. RESULTS: We found statistical differences between pregnancy and birth outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year before. The risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, preterm birth and NICU admission were clinically significant. Also, there was a significant decrease in mean gestational age. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pregnancy outcome by increasing morbidities and complications during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum. In addition, extensive quarantine outbreaks disrupted the healthcare system and hindered access to prenatal services. It is necessary to develop preventive and therapeutic care protocols for similar pandemic conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012140", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory disease", "locations": [{"offset": 76, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 110, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 123, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 195, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 296, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 432, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 518, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 702, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 711, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 825, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 995, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1036, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D050497", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stillbirth", "locations": [{"offset": 1257, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000013", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "congenital anomaly", "locations": [{"offset": 1269, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003920", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "diabetes", "locations": [{"offset": 1329, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1451, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1730, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003920", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "diabetes", "locations": [{"offset": 1815, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1985, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "quarantine", "locations": [{"offset": 2146, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993814, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "species@11118", "disease@MESH:D050497", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D012140", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D003920", "disease@MESH:D000013"], "journal": "BMC Pregnancy Childbirth", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Gholami R", "Borumandnia N", "Kalhori E", "Taheri M", "Khodakarami N"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Furthermore, an assessment of life expectancy during the decade preceding COVID-19 provides a point of comparison for life expectancy estimates and trends post COVID-19 as cities recover. METHODS: Using National Vital Statistics System mortality data and American Community Survey population estimates, we calculated the average annual city-level life expectancies for the non-Hispanic Black (Black), non-Hispanic White (White), and total populations. We then calculated the absolute difference between the Black and White life expectancies for each of the 30 cities and the U.S. We analyzed trends over four time periods (2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016, and 2017-2019). RESULTS: In 2017-2019, life expectancies ranged from 72.75 years in Detroit to 83.15 years in San Francisco (compared to 78.29 years for the U.S.). Black life expectancy ranged from 69.94 years in Houston to 79.04 years in New York, while White life expectancy ranged from 75.18 years in Jacksonville to 86.42 years in Washington, DC. Between 2008-2010 and 2017-2019, 17 of the biggest cities experienced a statistically significant improvement in life expectancy, while 9 cities experienced a significant decrease. Black life expectancy increased significantly in 14 cities and the U.S. but decreased significantly in 4 cities. White life expectancy increased significantly in 17 cities and the U.S. but decreased in 8 cities. In 2017-2019, the U.S. and all but one of the big cities had a significantly longer life expectancy for the White population compared to the Black population. There was more than a 13-year difference between Black and White life expectancies in Washington, DC (compared to 4.18 years at the national level). From 2008-2010 to 2017-2019, the racial gap decreased significantly for the U.S. and eight cities, while it increased in seven cities.

In this study, we perform an analysis of the humoral and cellular SARS-CoV-2 response immune of 32 convalescent COVID-19 children (children), 27 convalescent vaccinated adults(C + V+) and 7 unvaccinated convalescent adults (C + V-). Similarly to adults, a significant reduction of cross-reactive neutralizing capacity against delta and omicron VOC was observed 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While SAR-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity was comparable among children and C + V- against all VOC, children demonstrated as expected an inferior humoral response when compared to C + V+.

When compared to V + C+, children presented even comparable frequencies of WT-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with high avidity and functionality.

However, immune imprinting induced by vaccination based on the ancestral (hereafter referred to as WT) strain would compromise the antibody response to Omicron-based boosters1-5. Vaccination strategies to counter immune imprinting are critically needed. Here we investigated the degree and dynamics of immune imprinting in mouse models and human cohorts, especially focusing on the role of repeated Omicron stimulation. In mice, the efficacy of single Omicron boosting is heavily limited when using variants that are antigenically distinct from WT-such as the XBB variant-and this concerning situation could be mitigated by a second Omicron booster. Similarly, in humans, repeated Omicron infections could alleviate WT vaccination-induced immune imprinting and generate broad neutralization responses in both plasma and nasal mucosa. Notably, deep mutational scanning-based epitope characterization of 781 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-targeting monoclonal antibodies isolated from repeated Omicron infection revealed that double Omicron exposure could induce a large proportion of matured Omicron-specific antibodies that have distinct RBD epitopes to WT-induced antibodies. Consequently, immune imprinting was largely mitigated, and the bias towards non-neutralizing epitopes observed in single Omicron exposures was restored. On the basis of the deep mutational scanning profiles, we identified evolution hotspots of XBB.1.5 RBD and demonstrated that these mutations could further boost the immune-evasion capability of XBB.1.5 while maintaining high ACE2-binding affinity. Our findings suggest that the WT component should be abandoned when updating COVID-19 vaccines, and individuals without prior Omicron exposure should receive two updated vaccine boosters.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 104, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 154, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "10090", "type": "Species"}, "text": "mouse", "locations": [{"offset": 508, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 525, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "10090", "type": "Species"}, "text": "mice", "locations": [{"offset": 608, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 849, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 874, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1184, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 1739, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1839, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993710, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "gene@59272", "disease@MESH:D007239", "species@10090", "species@9606", "species@2697049"], "journal": "Nature", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Yisimayi A", "Song W", "Wang J", "Jian F", "Yu Y", "Chen X", "Xu Y", "Yang S", "Niu X", "Xiao T", "Wang J", "Zhao L", "Sun H", "An R", "Zhang N", "Wang Y", "Wang P", "Yu L", "Lv Z", "Gu Q", "Shao F", "Jin R", "Shen Z", "Xie XS", "Wang Y", "Cao Y"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Overall, the samples were similar to previously reported SARS-CoV-2 from Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The main lineages were AY.46 and A.23, which are considered to be Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Further, a total of 268 unique single nucleotide variants and 1456 mutations were found, with more than seventy percent mutations in the ORF1ab and S genes. The most common mutations were 2042C>G (83.4%), 14143C>T (79.5%), 245T>C (65%), and 1129G>T (51%), which occurred in the S, ORF1ab, ORF7a and N genes, respectively. As well, 28 structural variants-21 insertions and 7 deletions, occurred in 16 samples.

METHODS: We monitored mental health of a cohort of 100 asylum-seekers during their 14-day COVID-19-related quarantine in reception facilities in Rome, Italy, through the administration of six questionnaires (a demographic survey, the WHO-5 well-being index, the Primary Care PTSD Screen for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5), the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report, and the LiMEs-Italian version). Through the combination of statistical analysis and supervised learning, we studied the impact of the first contact with the reception system on asylum-seekers' mental health and sought for possible risk and shielding factors for PTSD. RESULTS: We find that sheltering in refugee centers has a positive impact on migrants' mental health; asylum-seekers with PTSD reported more traumatic events and personality characteristics related to loss and trauma; life events are predictors of PTSD in asylum-seekers.

Limited research has longitudinally tracked the mental health trajectories of parents over the active pandemic period. In addition, parents' history of adverse (ACEs) and benevolent (BCEs) childhood experiences may compound or attenuate the effect of COVID-19 stressors on parental psychopathology. OBJECTIVE: To identify distinct longitudinal trajectories of parental mental health over the COVID-19 pandemic and how these trajectories are associated with parental ACEs, BCEs, and COVID-19 stress. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 547 parents of 5-18-year-old children from the U.K., U.S., Canada, and Australia. METHODS: Growth mixture modelling was used to identify trajectories of parental mental health (distress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and substance use) from May 2020 to October 2021. COVID-19 stress, ACEs, and BCEs were assessed as predictors of mental health trajectories via multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Two-class trajectories of \"Low Stable\" and \"Moderate Stable\" symptoms were identified for psychological distress and anxiety. Three-class trajectories of \"Low Stable\", \"High Stable\", and \"High Decreasing\" symptoms were observed for post-traumatic stress. Reliable trajectories for substance use could not be identified.

While the technology industry is central to coordinated efforts to prevent online abuse and remove harmful content, it is largely exempt from formal child protection obligations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the response of the technology industry to online child sexual exploitation during COVID-19 from the perspective of anti-exploitation professionals. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: An international sample of fifteen anti-exploitation professionals were interviewed as part of a larger study on the impacts of COVID-19 on online child sexual exploitation. METHODS: Interviews were coded based on a template analysis with a focus on interactions with the technology sector during COVID-19. RESULTS: Major themes arising from the analysis were 1) the burden of online safety work on victims and services, 2) the lack of prioritisation of online child protection by technology companies during COVID-19 and 3) the complicity of the technology industry with the online sexploitation of children. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the views of anti-exploitation professionals highlights the alignment between the economic interests of the technology sector and the sexual interests of online child abusers in the absence of government oversight. A framework of sexual politics highlights the gendered nature this alignment and emphasises the need for regulatory intervention, harm minimisation and the restructuring of the online environment and technology sector in the interests of child safety.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 172, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 224, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 265, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 441, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 569, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 602, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 668, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 822, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 841, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 991, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1155, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1203, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1294, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1494, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1786, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993364, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Child Abuse Negl", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Salter M", "Woodlock D", "Wong T"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

According to the latest recommendations, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is indicated as an early treatment for adults not requiring oxygen therapy but at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. In case of contraindication, remdesivir is an alternative therapy. PERSPECTIVES: Although there is no indication for convalescent plasma outside of clinical trials, it seems promising for immunocompromised patients, particularly those with B lymphopenia. It is noteworthy that currently, with the predominance of the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant, monoclonal antibodies are no longer recommended as therapy except for sotrovimab, which still has partial efficacy and could be considered after expert opinion as salvage therapy in a previously well-established program.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients with SLE from 1 May to 31 October 2020. SETTING: Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) databases from general practitioners across England combining primary care and other health-related data. PARTICIPANTS: Overall, 6145 adults with confirmed SLE diagnosis >=1 year prior to 1 May 2020 were included. Most patients were women (91.0%), white (67.1%), and diagnosed with SLE at age <50 (70.8%). Patients were excluded if they had a COVID-19 diagnosis before 1 May 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics and clinical characteristics were compared. COVID-19 severity was determined by patient care required and procedure/diagnosis codes. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalisation rates, lengths of stay and mortality rates were determined and stratified by SLE and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of 6145 patients, 3927 had mild, 1288 moderate and 930 severe SLE at baseline. The majority of patients with moderate to severe SLE were on oral corticosteroids and antimalarial treatments. Overall, 54/6145 (0.88%) patients with SLE acquired and were diagnosed with COVID-19, with 45 classified as mild, 6 moderate and 3 severe COVID-19. Cumulative incidence was higher in patients with severe SLE (1.4%) compared with patients classified as mild (0.8%) or moderate (0.8%). Ten COVID-19-specific hospital admissions occurred (n=6 moderate; n=4 severe). Regardless of COVID-19 status, hospital admission rates and length of stay increased with SLE severity. Of 54 patients with SLE diagnosed with COVID-19, 1 (1.9%) COVID-19-related death was recorded in a patient with both severe SLE and severe COVID-19.

This pilot study investigated the feasibility and short-term impacts of HWF, adapted from a successful Scottish initiative. METHODS: Setting: CFH services in five sites across two states, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Caregivers of children aged 0-5 years experiencing financial hardship (study-designed screen). DESIGN: Mixed methods. With limited progress using a randomised trial (RCT) design in sites 1-3 (March 2020-November 2021), qualitative interviews with service providers identified implementation barriers including stigma, lack of knowledge of financial counselling, low financial literacy, research burden and pandemic disruption. This informed a simplified RCT protocol (site 4) and direct referral model (no randomisation, pre-post evaluation, site 5) (June 2021-May 2022). INTERVENTION: financial counselling; comparator: usual care (sites 1-4). Feasibility measures: proportions of caregivers screened, enrolled, followed up and who accessed financial counselling. Impact measures: finances (quantitative) and other (qualitative) to 6 months post-enrolment. RESULTS: 355/434 caregivers completed the screen (60%-100% across sites). In RCT sites (1-4), 79/365 (19%-41%) reported hardship but less than one-quarter enrolled. In site 5, n=66/69 (96%) caregivers reported hardship and 44/66 (67%) engaged with financial counselling; common issues were utility debts (73%), and obtaining entitlements (43%) or material aid/emergency relief (27%). Per family, financial counselling increased income from government entitlements by an average $A6504 annually plus $A784 from concessions, grants, brokerage and debt waivers. Caregivers described benefits (qualitative) including reduced stress, practical help, increased knowledge and empowerment. CONCLUSIONS: Financial hardship screening via CFH was acceptable to caregivers, direct referral was feasible, but individual randomisation was infeasible. Larger-scale implementation will require careful, staged adaptations where CFH populations and the intervention are well matched and low burden evaluation.

AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on primary care service use in the last three months of life, including consultations and prescribing, and to identify associated factors DESIGN & SETTING: A retrospective cohort study in United Kingdom (UK), using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). METHOD: The study cohort included those who died between 2019 and 2020. Poisson regression models using generalised estimation equations (GEE) were used to examine the association between primary care use and patient characteristics. Adjusted Rate Ratios (aRRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 44,534 patients died during the study period. The pandemic period was associated with an 8.9% increase in the rate of consultations from 966.4 to 1052.9 per 1,000 person-months and 14.3% longer telephone consultation duration (from 10.1 to 11.5 minutes), with a switch from face-to-face to telephone/video consultations. The prescription of end-of-life care medications increased by 6.3%, from 1313.7-1396.3 per 1,000 person-months. The adjusted rate ratios for consultations (aRRs: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.06-1.10, P<0.001) and prescriptions (aRRs 1.05: 95% CI 1.03-1.07, P<0.001) also increased during the pandemic.

From the initial screening, apart from the previously reported hit oridonin (protein binding ratio of 0.56 in the initial screening, Kd = 7.2 +- 1.0 muM), we have identified a second Nsp9-interacting compound, the diterpenoid ryanodine, with a protein binding ratio of 0.3 and a Kd of 48.05 +- 5.03 muM. To gain deeper insights into the binding interactions and to explore potential structural requirements, the collision-induced affinity selection mass spectrometry (CIAS-MS) approach allowed us to identify six known oridonin analogues produced by the plant Rabdosia rubescens, each with varying affinities to Nsp9. Native MS validation of their individual binding activities to Nsp9 revealed that all analogues exhibited reduced affinity compared to oridonin. Structural-activity relationship analysis highlighted key functional groups, including 1-OH, 6-OH, 7-OH, and the enone moiety, which are crucial for Nsp9 binding.

Vaccine effectiveness against PCC was estimated using Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities (diabetes and cardiovascular, respiratory, and psychiatric disease), number of healthcare contacts during 2019, socioeconomic factors, and dominant virus variant at time of infection. RESULTS: Of 299 692 vaccinated individuals with covid-19, 1201 (0.4%) had a diagnosis of PCC during follow-up, compared with 4118 (1.4%) of 290 030 unvaccinated individuals. Covid-19 vaccination with any number of doses before infection was associated with a reduced risk of PCC (adjusted hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.46), with a vaccine effectiveness of 58%. Of the vaccinated individuals, 21 111 received one dose only, 205 650 received two doses, and 72 931 received three or more doses. Vaccine effectiveness against PCC for one dose, two doses, and three or more doses was 21%, 59%, and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest a strong association between covid-19 vaccination before infection and reduced risk of receiving a diagnosis of PCC. The findings highlight the importance of primary vaccination against covid-19 to reduce the population burden of PCC.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 186, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 293, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 375, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 540, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 583, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 743, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 759, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 965, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 989, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003920", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "diabetes", "locations": [{"offset": 1210, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001523", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "psychiatric disease", "locations": [{"offset": 1256, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1382, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1441, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1567, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1620, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2104, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2132, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2261, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993131, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D001523", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D003920"], "journal": "BMJ", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Lundberg-Morris L", "Leach S", "Xu Y", "Martikainen J", "Santosa A", "Gissl&#xe9;n M", "Li H", "Nyberg F", "Bygdell M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Assessment of mobility outcomes that can be measured digitally (digital mobility outcomes (DMOs)) in daily life such as gait speed and steps per day is increasingly possible using devices such as pedometers and accelerometers, but the predictive value of these measures remains unclear in relation to key outcomes such as hospital admission and survival. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, nested within a larger scoping review by the MOBILISE-D consortium, addressing DMOs in a range of chronic conditions. Qualitative and quantitative analysis considering steps per day and gait speed and their association with clinical outcomes in COPD patients was performed. RESULTS: 21 studies (6076 participants) were included. Nine studies evaluated steps per day and 11 evaluated a measure reflecting gait speed in daily life. Negative associations were demonstrated between mortality risk and steps per day (per 1000 steps) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.88, p<0.001), gait speed (<0.80 m s-1) (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.72-7.36, p<0.001) and gait speed (per 1.0 m s-1) (HR 7.55, 95% CI 1.11-51.3, p=0.04). Fewer steps per day (per 1000) and slow gait speed (<0.80 m s-1) were also associated with increased healthcare utilisation (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88, p<0.001; OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.42-7.94, p=0.01, respectively). Available evidence was of low-moderate quality with few studies eligible for meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Daily step count and gait speed are negatively associated with mortality risk and other important outcomes in people with COPD and therefore may have value as prognostic indicators in clinical trials, but the quantity and quality of evidence is limited.

This work tests the hypothesis that the loss of SNR on dark-blood cardiac T2*-weighted images of IMH stems from spin-relaxation during the long RF pulses in double inversion preparation, as a result, compromising image contrast for intramyocardial hemorrhage detection. METHODS: Phantom and in-vivo animal studies were performed to test the hypothesis of the study. An agar phantom was imaged with multi-gradient-echo T2* imaging protocols with and without double-inversion-recovery (DIR) preparation. Image acquisitions were placed at different delay times (TD) after DIR preparation. SNR, T2* and Coefficient of Variation (COV) were measured and compared between DIR-prepared and non-DIR-prepared images. Canines with hemorrhagic myocardial infarctions were scanned at 3.0 T with DIR-prepared (dark-blood) and non-DIR-prepared (bright-blood) T2* imaging protocols. DIR-prepared T2* images were acquired with short, medium, and long delay times (TD). SNR, CNR, intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH) extent, T2* and COV were measured and compared between DIR-prepared T2* images with short, medium, and long delay times (TD) to non-DIR-prepared bright-blood T2* images. RESULTS: Phantom studies confirmed the hypothesis that the SNR loss on DIR-prepared T2* images originated from signal loss during DIR preparation. SNR followed T1 recovery curve with increased delay times (TD) indicating that SNR can be recovered with longer time delay between DIR and image acquisition. Myocardial T2* values were not affected by DIR preparation but COV of T2* was elevated. Animal studies supported the hypothesis and showed that DIR-prepared T2* images with insufficient delay time (TD) had impaired sensitivity for IMH detection due to lower SNR and CNR, and higher COV. CONCLUSION: We conclude that lower SNR and CNR on DIR-prepared T2* images originate from signal loss during DIR preparation and insufficient recovery between DIR preparation and image acquisition. Although, the impaired sensitivity can be recovered by extending delay time (TD), it will extend the scan time. Bright-blood T2* imaging protocols should remain the optimal choice for assessment of intramyocardial hemorrhage. DIR-prepared dark-blood T2* imaging protocols should be performed with extra attention on image signal-to-noise ratio when used for intramyocardial hemorrhage detection.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhage", "locations": [{"offset": 281, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhage", "locations": [{"offset": 728, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "COV", "locations": [{"offset": 1105, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9615", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Canines", "locations": [{"offset": 1187, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009203", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhagic myocardial infarctions", "locations": [{"offset": 1200, "length": 34}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhage", "locations": [{"offset": 1458, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "COV", "locations": [{"offset": 1491, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "COV", "locations": [{"offset": 2013, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "COV", "locations": [{"offset": 2232, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhage", "locations": [{"offset": 2648, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006470", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hemorrhage", "locations": [{"offset": 2808, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37993042, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@11118", "species@9615", "disease@MESH:D009203", "disease@MESH:D006470"], "journal": "Magn Reson Imaging", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Guan X", "Zhang X", "Yang HJ", "Dharmakumar R"]}

METHODS: Longitudinal data collected between 2019 and 2021 were used. Analyses were based on data from 42,005 middle-aged and older adults from 27 European countries who participated in the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and two SHARE Corona Surveys. Prospective associations were examined using generalized estimating equations. A series of secondary analyses and the sensitivity of the associations to unmeasured confounding provided evidence for the robustness of results. All analyses were conducted in December 2022. RESULTS: Helping others outside one's home in the first wave of COVID-19 was associated with subsequent increased risks of depression and anxiety. It was concurrently associated with an increased probability of an uplifting, hope, and happiness-inducing experience. Engagement in volunteer activities conducted in addition to helping was found to be prospectively associated with higher probability of an uplifting experience, but not with depression and anxiety. These associations were independent of demographic and socio-economic characteristics, personality traits, prior quality of life and health history as well as pre-COVID-19 engagement in altruistic activities.

Here we investigate the relation between virus loads and the number of hospital admissions in the Netherlands.

Covariates include municipal vaccination coverages stratified by age and dose (first, second, and booster) and prevalence of the circulating coronavirus variants (wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2)). Our model captures the relation between hospital admissions and virus loads well. Estimated hospitalisation rates per 1,000,000 persons per day at a virus load of 1013 particles range from 0.18 (95 % Prediction Interval (PI): 0.046-0.48) in children (0-19 years) to 20.1 (95 % PI: 9.46-36.8) in the oldest age group (80 years and older) in an unvaccinated population with only wildtype SARS-CoV-2 circulation. The analyses indicate a nearly twofold (1.92 (95 % PI: 1.78-2.05)) decrease in the expected number of hospitalisations at a given virus load between the Alpha and the Omicron variant. Our analyses show that virus load estimates in wastewater are closely related to the expected number of hospitalisations and provide an attractive tool to detect increased SARS-CoV-2 circulation at a local scale, even when there are few hospital admissions.

We confirmed that the RT-LAMP-PfAgo assay for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant produced significantly higher fluorescent signals (p < 0.001) when a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), exclusive to the Delta variant, was present, compared to the samples without the SNP. Additionally, the duplex assay for Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMOV) and SARS-CoV-2 detection produced specific fluorescent signals (FAM or ROX) only when the corresponding sequences were present. Furthermore, the RT-LAMP-PfAgo assay does not require dilution to reduce the impact of environmental inhibitors. The limit of detection of the PMMOV assay, determined with 30 wastewater samples, was 28 gc/muL, with a 95 % confidence interval of [11,103]. Finally, using a point-of-use device, the RT-LAMP-PfAgo assay successfully detected PMMOV in wastewater samples.

Among various regions, Western Europe and the Contiguous United States experienced the most substantial reduction in air traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, only the Southwestern United States demonstrated a significant decrease in cirrus clouds, leading to notable changes in shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud radiative effects.

METHODS: We analysed cases of adult, non-traumatic, OHCA from the Canadian Resuscitation Outcome Consortium (CanROC) registry who were treated between January 27th, 2018, and December 31st, 2021. We used adjusted regression models and interrupted time series analysis to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 27th, 2020 - December 31st, 2021)on the care provided to patients with OHCA by EMS clinicians. RESULTS: There were 12,947 cases of OHCA recorded in the CanROC registry in the pre-COVID-19 period and 17,488 during the COVID-19 period. We observed a reduction in the cumulative number of defibrillations provided by EMS (aRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.89 - 0.93, p<0.01), a reduction in the odds of attempts at intubation (aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31 - 0.34, p<0.01), higher rates of supraglottic airway use (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.30, p<0.01), a reduction in vascular access (aOR for intravenous access 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 - 0.89, p<0.01; aOR for intraosseous access 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 - 0.96, p<0.01), a reduction in the odds of epinephrine administration (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 - 0.94, p<0.01), and higher odds of resuscitation termination on scene (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.31 - 1.46, p<0.01).

In this study, we investigated the effects of vaccination with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vector expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (MVA-S) on the lung transcriptome from susceptible K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. One dose of MVA-S regulated genes related to viral infection control, inflammation processes, T-cell response, cytokine production and IFN-gamma signalling. Down-regulation of Rhcg and Tnfsf18 genes post-vaccination with one and two doses of MVA-S may represent a mechanism for controlling infection immunity and vaccine-induced protection. One dose of MVA-S provided partial protection with a distinct lung transcriptomic profile to healthy animals, while two doses of MVA-S fully protected against infection with a transcriptomic profile comparable to that of non-vaccinated healthy animals. This suggests that the MVA-S booster generates a robust and rapid antigen-specific immune response preventing virus infection. Notably, down-regulation of Atf3 and Zbtb16 genes in mice vaccinated with two doses of MVA-S may contribute to vaccine control of innate immune system and inflammation processes in the lungs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study shows host transcriptomic mechanisms likely involved in the MVA-S vaccine-mediated immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could help in improving vaccine dose assessment and developing novel, well-optimized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates against prevalent or emerging VoCs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type":

Vaccination is the front line of prevention, and antiinflammatory and antiviral drugs are the treatment of this disease. In addition, some herbal therapy approaches can be a good way to deal with this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of propolis syrup with Hyoscyamus niger L. extract in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with acute disease conditions in a double-blinded approach. The study was performed on 140 patients with COVID-19 in a double-blind, randomized, and multicentral approach. The main inclusion criterion was the presence of a severe type of COVID-19 disease. The duration of treatment with syrup was 6 days and 30 CC per day in the form of three meals. On Days 0, 2, 4, and 6, arterial blood oxygen levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood cell, as well as the patient's clinical symptoms such as fever and chills, cough and shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms, were recorded and analyzed. Propolis syrup with H. niger L. significantly reduces cough from the second day, relieving shortness of breath on the fourth day, and significantly reduces CRP, weakness, and lethargy, as well as significantly increased arterial blood oxygen pressure on the sixth day compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). The results in patients are such that in the most severe conditions of the disease 80% < SpO2 (oxygen saturation), the healing process of the syrup on reducing CRP and increasing arterial blood oxygen pressure from the fourth day is significantly different compared with the placebo group (p < 0.05). The use of syrup is associated with a reduction of 3.6 days in the hospitalization period compared with the placebo group. Propolis syrup with H. niger L. has effectiveness in the viral and inflammatory phases on clinical symptoms and blood parameters and arterial blood oxygen levels of patients with COVID-19. Also, it reduces referrals to the intensive care unit and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

AIM: The present study investigates the perspectives of parents of students requiring additional provisions in relation to the schools' responsiveness against their children's educational and psychosocial needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on (non-) applied inclusive and empowerment practices of parenthood. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A sample of 125 parents in Greece filled out a self-reported questionnaire providing information on four main themes: school organisation in accordance with the COVID-19 measures; distance education; support on transition from quarantine and remote education back to school; and parental empowerment. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The data revealed that most of the participating parents felt poorly supported during the pandemic. The feeling of being left alone in supporting their children and in fully meeting their personal needs and emotions was also identified. The demographics of the participating parents with children with additional needs revealed an experiences mosaic in relation to the parents' level of education, the number of children who were present in their households, the children's gender as well as their level of school education (preschool- and primary school-aged or secondary school-aged pupils) and attendance of the school programme in regular or special schools. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Data suggest that regular and special schools in Greece, as orchestrated by the Ministry of Education, deployed practices that left students requiring additional provisions unsupported in relation to their educational and psychosocial needs while their parents felt disempowered during the whole period of the COVID-19 pandemic. A range of implications on a more effective support for families and their children with additional needs in alignment with the principles of inclusive education is detailed and discussed. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The focus of research on the schools' responsiveness to the needs of students requiring additional provisions from the perspective of their parents is of critical importance as it may offer valuable insights pertaining to the school's inclusive policy practices and the promotion of empowering parent partnerships during crisis times. The knowledge gained by exploring parents' experiences will contribute significantly to inform modifications and changes in education delivery in crisis times so as school, as a social system, become more inclusive, supportive, and effective for pupils with additional needs. So far, little attention has been paid to the above-mentioned issues. In the current paper, the parents perspectives were explored through a self-reported questionnaire to reflect on the way schools responded to theirs and their children's educational and psychosocial needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the participating parents felt poorly supported. The feeling of being left alone in supporting their children and in fully meeting their personal needs and emotions was also identified. The demographics of the participating parents with children requiring additional provisions revealed an experiences mosaic in relation to the parents' level of education, the number of children who were present in their households, the children's gender as well as their level of school education (preschool and primary school or secondary school education) and attendance of the school programme in regular or special schools.

Here, this study aimed to investigate the impact of virulent or avirulent IBV infection on the avian host by conducting proteomics with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) in the kidneys of IBV-infected chickens. The results revealed 267, 489, and 510 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the chicken kidneys at 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection (dpi), respectively, when infected with the GD17/04 strain, which is a highly nephrogenic strain and belongs to the 4/91 genotype. In contrast, the attenuated 4/91 vaccine resulted in the identification of 144, 175, and 258 DEPs at 3, 5, and 7 dpi, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses indicated distinct expression profiles between the 2 IBV strains. Upon GD17/04 infection, metabolic pathways respond initially in the early stage (3 dpi) and immune-related signaling pathways respond in the middle and late stages (5 and 7 dpi). The 4/91 vaccine elicited a completely opposite response compared to the GD17/04 infection. Among all DEPs, 62 immune-related DEPs were focused on and found to be mainly enriched in the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway and involved in humoral and cellular immunity. Notably, key molecules in the IFN-I signaling pathway including MDA5, LGP2, and TBK1 may serve as regulatory targets of IBV.

In Model 1, exposure was motherhood (binary), interacting with a variable that split time in the pre-pandemic and lockdown periods. In Model 2, workplace size (Micro:1-24, Medium: 25-199, Large: More than 200 employees) was added as an exposure (3-way interaction) to investigate moderation effects. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for age, ethnicity, UK country of residence, cohabitation, educational qualifications, working hours, furlough, subjective financial difficulty and previous health condition. In the adjusted Model 1, pre-pandemic, odds of GHQ-12 caseness were lower for mothers compared to non-mothers (OR:0.89 95%CI:0.77,1.03). However post-pandemic compared to pre-pandemic, odds for mothers were higher than non-mothers, especially during lockdown 3 (Non-mothers: OR:1.93 95%CI:1.69,2.20; Mothers: OR:2.87 95%CI:2.36,3.49). In Model 2, workplace size did not modify the relationship. Pre-pandemic, there was no difference in the odds of GHQ-12 caseness by workplace size; however, the differences observed in Lockdown 3 between non-mothers and mothers, are mainly attributed to differences in medium-sized enterprises (Non-mothers: OR:1.95 95%CI:1.53,2.48; Mothers: OR:3.56 95%CI:2.54,4.99). Future policies should be designed to facilitate the working lives of mothers, but especially for medium-sized enterprises as extreme uncertainty appears to affect these employees more.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 156, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008569", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "detrimental", "locations": [{"offset": 178, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 351, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 406, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 576, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 640, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 675, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37992613, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:D008569", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Soc Sci Med", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Wilson J", "Demou E", "Kromydas T"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Speed surveys were conducted on 219 road segments before and after the implementation of the speed limit change. The study utilized a before-and-after with a comparison group approach to evaluate the impact on collisions, using 50 km/h roads that maintained their speed limit throughout as the comparison group. The impact of the reduced speed limit on road safety was assessed by analyzing collision data for two periods, pre-COVID (2017-2019) and COVID (2019-2021), compared to the period after setting the new speed limit (2021-2022). Two-sample t-tests were employed to examine the change in speeds. The analysis revealed statistically significant reductions in the overall number of collisions and injuries and fatalities resulting from collisions, by 25% and 31%, respectively. The study also categorized neighborhoods and roads to demonstrate the areas that experienced the greatest benefits. Speed data showed statistically significant reductions in the average and 85th percentile speeds, with drivers lowering their speeds at 115 locations, accounting for 53% of the surveyed locations. Moreover, higher speed reductions were observed on local roads compared to collector roads, and narrower roads compared to wider roads..

We collected data on baseline characteristics, prone positioning, NMB use and patient outcome. We assessed arterial blood gas data during supine and prone positioning and after return to the supine position. RESULTS: We studied 548 prone episodes in 220 patients (mean age 54 years, 61% male) of whom 164 (75%) received NMBs. Mean PaO2:FiO2 (P/F ratio) during the first prone episode with NMBs reached 208 +- 63 mmHg compared with 161 +- 66 mmHg without NMBs (Deltamean = 47 +- 5 mmHg) for an absolute increase from baseline of 76 +- 56 mmHg versus 55 +- 56 mmHg (padj < 0.001). The mean P/F ratio on return to the supine position was 190 +- 63 mmHg in the NMB group versus 141 +- 64 mmHg in the non-NMB group for an absolute increase from baseline of 59 +- 58 mmHg versus 34 +- 56 mmHg (padj < 0.001).

METHOD: The research used an explorative qualitative approach. Six focus groups and ten individual interviews were conducted online and audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis and mixed coding. RESULTS: Forty professionals participated in the study. Four common themes emerged in all groups: challenges related to the lack of pandemic preparedness, concerns about personal protective equipment, unclear guidelines for case and contact tracing, and communication-related difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the key recommendations to improve non-pharmacological preventive interventions to reduce workers' fears and worries about the risk of infection and spreading the infection to others, including families. Above all, these should include ensuring the availability, and correct use of adequate personal protective equipment, improve guidelines on case and contact tracing, and setting effective communication channels for all workers of the organization.

The dynamics and transmission of ARTIs have been significantly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the change in admission rates of Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The study included hospitalized pediatric patients who underwent RSV testing in three periods: pre-pandemic (2019), during the pandemic (2020-2021), and the immediate post-pandemic (2022). RSV testing was conducted using either PCR or antigen tests. RESULTS: Between January 2019 to December 2022, out of 927 tested patients, 173 (18.7%) were positive for RSV. The yearly positivity rates were as follows: 42 (35.6%) of 118, 24 (33.3%) of 72, 15 (18.5%) of 81, and 92 (14%) of 656, yearly from 2019 to 2022, respectively (P < 0.00001). Among all cases, 150 (16.2%) required hospitalization, including 94 (62.7%) males and 56 (37.3%) females. The admission rate to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 25 (16.7%), and mechanical ventilation was required for 10 (6.6%) patients. The overall case fatality rate was 0.7%. A Binary logistic regression analysis showed upper respiratory tract symptoms were more common in patients admitted in 2019 compared to 2022 (odd ratio:20.9, 95% CI: 4.2-104.1, P value < 0.0001).

This study aims to assess the process and outcome quality of care for hospitalized older adult patients with pneumonia before and after the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of older adult patients (age >= 65) hospitalized for non-COVID pneumonia were recruited from five Korean hospitals (January 20, 2019, to January 19, 2021). The quality of care before and after the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 7356 hospitalization episodes of older adult pneumonia were identified, and 978 cases (552 pre-pandemic and 426 during the pandemic) were analyzed. The pneumonia severity score was higher during the pandemic, and the waiting time from the emergency room to admission was also longer. Furthermore, the pneumonia mortality rate during the pandemic was higher than that in the pre-pandemic period (in-hospital mortality: 10.1% vs. 18.1%; 90-day mortality: 11.6% vs. 22.3%). A significantly higher mortality risk was observed during the pandemic than in the period prior (adjusted odds ratio: 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.63).

SEARCH STRATEGY: The search was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews by 25th May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria involved pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 who underwent caesarean section and those who had vaginal deliveries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The included studies were meta-analyzed for various outcomes including: Gestational age, maternal intensive care unit admission, maternal death, prematurity, newborn birth weight, newborn intensive care unit admission, Apgar scores, newborn death, and newborn vertical transmission of COVID-19. The meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software, version 3.3.070. MAIN RESULTS: The meta-analyses included 2,566 deliveries (866 caesarean sections and 1,700 vaginal deliveries) and identified that caesarean section was significantly associated with increased prematurity (OR 2.5 [1.7; 3.6], p < 0.001), lower birth weight (-118 g [-170; -66], p < 0.001), and a higher need for maternal (OR 9.54 [5.22; 17.43], p < 0.01) and neonatal intensive care unit intervention (OR 3.67 [2.71; 4.96], p < 0.01) compared to vaginal delivery.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with post COVID-19 hair loss between July to December 2021 at a tertiary care center. Detailed history, clinical examination, trichoscopy and biochemical tests were performed and recorded. COVID-19 disease severity was assessed based on duration of COVID-19 infection and place of management. RESULTS: The study included 120 patients with a mean age of 39.6 years. The majority of the patients were females treated at home and had COVID-19 infection for >2 weeks. The mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for stress was 5.25. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 56.7% and low ferritin in 30% of cases. The mean time of onset of hair loss post COVID-19 was 49 days. Patients mainly presented with diffuse hair loss. Trichodynia was present in 15.8% of cases. The degree of hair loss was severe in 55.8% of the subjects. Positive hair pull test was seen in 65% of patients. Most common trichoscopic features included single hair follicles (81.7%) and vellus hair >10% (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The mean time of onset of hair loss post COVID-19 infection was less than 2 months.

We collected data through clinical assessment of the disease, questionnaires on personal habits and standardized skin surface biopsy to study the Demodex mites count. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 30 patients. In the pandemic period, 5/30 patients had a relapse of mild papulopustular rosacea; the Demodex sample resulted positive in 4/5 relapsed patients. In the post-pandemic period, 4/30 patients reported a relapse of mild rosacea (3 patients) and moderate papulopustular rosacea (1 patient).

Vaccine hesitancy has been observed for different vaccines. For COVID-19 vaccines, multiple factors influence vaccine uptake in the U.S. including political ideology. A more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine uptake within political parties is needed. This study assesses the relationship between known vaccine hesitancy factors and vaccine uptake within two major political parties. Data from 804 U.S. participants in an online survey from June 2021 was used to assess the association between COVID-19 vaccine uptake (no dose vs. any dose) and categories of factors thought to influence vaccine uptake (sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 disease and vaccine belief variables, belief in COVID-19 prevention behavior variables, and social network features variables) for Republicans and Democrats using bivariate and multivariate regression. 65.4% of the sample reported having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (22.6% Republican and 52.1% Democrat). In the total sample bivariate model, Democrat participants had significantly greater odds of having received a dose of the vaccine as compared to Republican participants (OR = 2.51, 95%CI = 1.73-3.64). In adjusted models, the speed of vaccine development was negatively associated with vaccine uptake for both Republicans (aOR = 0.18, 95%CI = 0.06-0.57) and Democrats (aOR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.19-0.86), as was concern about side effects from the vaccine (Republicans: aOR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.05-0.47; Democrats: aOR = 0.14, 95%CI = 0.06-0.31). COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Republicans, but not Democrats, was associated with belief that the vaccine prevents COVID-19 (aOR = 3.29, 95%CI = 1.29-8.37) and belief about friends' vaccine intentions (aOR = 6.19, 95%CI = 2.39-16.05). There were no significant factors unique to Democrats.

This research explores how feelings of loneliness connect to use of online dating sites during a pandemic, how older adults decided to and rationalized dating at a time when meeting in-person and social interactions were discouraged and dangerous, and how experiences differed between men and women.

All respondents were single, heterosexual, and recruited from online dating websites, but varied by race, education level, marital experience, employment status, and geographic location. Single older adults relied on feelings of loneliness and isolation, the ubiquity of online dating sites, and particularly for women, adherence to safety measures while on a date as motivation for seeking and meeting romantic partners during a pandemic.

Additionally, the peptide is resistant to proteolysis and has negligible cytotoxicity and hemolysis activity up to 150 muM toward cultured human cell lines and erythrocytes.

The purpose of this article is to share our experience to performing bedside surgical tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients in a safe and effective manner, whilst minimising the risk of viral transmission, to optimise patient outcomes and reduce risk to healthcare professionals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As recommended by ENT UK, we prospectively established a COVID Airway Team within the ENT department at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, consisting of four head and neck consultant surgeons to perform either open-bedside, open-theatre or percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. A specific stepwise method for bedside open surgical tracheostomy was based on ENT UK and British Laryngological Society recommendations. RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent tracheostomy during the study period (14 bedside-open, 5 open-theatre, 11 percutaneous). Mean duration of mechanical intubation prior to bedside-open tracheostomy was 14.5 days. The average time for open-bedside tracheostomy was 9 minutes compared to 31 minutes for open-theatre. There were no significant tracheostomy related complications with bedside-open tracheostomy. No healthcare professional involved reported acute COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: We describe our effective, safe and swift approach to bedside open tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experience demonstrated a short mean procedural time, with no tracheostomy-related complications and no reported viral transmission amongst the healthcare members involved.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 222, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 231, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 245, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 271, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 430, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 439, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 542, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 683, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 892, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 901, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1065, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005597", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bedside-open tracheostomy", "locations": [{"offset": 1221, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005597", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "open-bedside tracheostomy", "locations": [{"offset": 1283, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005597", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bedside-open tracheostomy", "locations": [{"offset": 1430, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1508, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1517, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005597", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bedside open tracheostomy", "locations": [{"offset": 1595, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1632, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37992143, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D005597"], "journal": "Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Wahid NW", "Deutsch P", "Amlani A", "Gupta KK", "Griffiths H", "Ahmad I"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Their most obvious advantage (firsthand self-report) is also the source of their main problems: the raw data requires interpretation, and are a snapshot of the specific sample's status at a given time. Efforts to deal with both issues created a bi-dimensional space defined by two orthogonal axes, in which most of the quantitative mental health research can be located. Methods aimed to assure that mental health diagnoses are solidly grounded on existing raw data are part of the individual validity axis. Tools allowing the generalization of the results across the entire population compose the collective validity axis. This paper raises a different question. Since one goal of mental health assessments is to obtain results that can be generalized to some extent, an important question is how robust is a questionnaire result when applied to a different population or to the same population at a different time. In this case, there is deep uncertainty, without any a priori probabilistic information. The main claim of this paper is that this task requires the development of a new robustness to deep uncertainty axis, defining a three-dimensional research space. We demonstrate the analysis of deep uncertainty using the concept of robustness in info-gap decision theory. Based on data from questionnaires collected before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, we first locate a mental health assessment in the space defined by the individual validity axis and the collective validity axis. Then we develop a model of info-gap robustness to uncertainty in mental health assessment, showing how the robustness to deep uncertainty axis interacts with the other two axes, highlighting the contributions and the limitations of this approach. The ability to measure robustness to deep uncertainty in the mental health realm is important particularly in troubled and changing times.

Die Bedeutung von Resilienz, die auf individueller, team- und organisationsbezogener Ebene gefordert werden sollte, spielt eine entscheidende Rolle. Hierfur sind Massnahmen wie Stressmanagement-Trainings, Unterstutzungssysteme, Kommunikation, Weiterbildung, emotionale Unterstutzung und Partizipationsmoglichkeiten erforderlich. Auch politische Massnahmen sind erforderlich, um das Wohlergehen des Gesundheitspersonals zu fordern, das sie die Gesetzgebung sowie die Verfugbarkeit von Akutunterstutzung und die Forderung von Forschung und Innovationen beeinflussen.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 217, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "bereits bestehende psychische", "locations": [{"offset": 421, "length": 29}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Stress", "locations": [{"offset": 525, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006623", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "von Posttraumatischen Belastungsstorungen", "locations": [{"offset": 542, "length": 41}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "Schlafstorungen", "locations": [{"offset": 611, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006623", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "von Resilienz", "locations": [{"offset": 810, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "Auch politische", "locations": [{"offset": 1125, "length": 15}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37992116, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C566666", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D006623", "disease@MESH:D000079225", "chemical@MESH:D008625", "chemical@MESH:D004052"], "journal": "Psychiatr Danub", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Kreh A", "Juen B", "Riedel PL", "Kulcar V"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The participants responded to the Depression Scale, COVID-19 Burnout Scale, Rumination Scale, Resilience Scale and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale face to face. The model that was developed within the scope of the current study was tested via path analysis, which is a technique of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). RESULTS: The study findings show that resilience and intolerance of uncertainty predict depression and rumination at a statistically significant level. Moreover, rumination directly predicts COVID-19 burnout, while COVID-19 burnout predicts depression. On the other hand, indirect effect modelling shows that resilience predicts depression with the mediating effect of rumination and COVID-19 burnout at a statistically significant level. Lastly, intolerance of uncertainty predicts depression with the mediating effect of rumination and COVID-19 burnout at a statistically significant level.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive survey conducted with 652 participants over the age of 18. The Obsession with COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and a Demographic Information Form were used to obtain information. Data were analyzed using SPSS and Spearman's Rho was calculated to examine existing relationships between COVID-19 anxiety and other research variables. A linear regression analysis was conducted to identify potential predictors of COVID-19 related obsessions. RESULTS: Participants infected with the COVID-19 virus had higher levels of anxiety and obsessions than those who weren't.

In this study, The Descriptive Data Form; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; The Health Education Students' Attitude Scale towards the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 were used. The electronic versions of the questionnaires were shared with students in WhatsApp groups. RESULTS: A total of 1132 students participated in the study and 23.2% of the students had mild, 21.6% moderate, and 2.8% severe depression. Additionally, 9.4% of the students had mild, 16.3% moderate, and 5.1% severe anxiety. Furthermore, 12.5% of the participants had mild and 5.5% had moderate stress. Smoking, prospective and inhibitory anxiety, negative perception of the state's efforts to prevent the outbreak, anxiety about the virus, and belief of intentional spread significantly affected depression, anxiety, and stress levels (p<0.05). Furthermore, the place of residence and the presence of acquaintances infected with COVID-19 significantly affected anxiety levels (p<0.05).

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of long COVID and its association with disease severity and vaccination status of the patient. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital and recruited patients aged > 18 years who were admitted between February 1 and June 7, 2021. During this time, 901 individuals were admitted, after excluding patients with missing data, a total of 481 confirmed cases were enrolled. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 56.9+-14.3 years. Among patients with known vaccination status (n = 474), 19%(n = 90) and 19.2%(n = 91) were fully and partially vaccinated, respectively. Severe/critical disease was present in 64%(n = 312). The mortality rate following discharge was 4.58%(n = 22). Around 18.9%(n = 91) of the population required readmission to the hospital, with respiratory failure (31.8%, n = 29) as the leading cause. Long COVID symptoms were present in 29.9%(n = 144), and these symptoms were more prevalent in the severe/critical (35.5%, n = 111) and unvaccinated (37.9%, n = 105) cohort. The most prominent symptoms were fatigue (26.2%, n = 126) and shortness of breath (24.1%, n = 116), followed by cough (15.2%, n = 73). Vaccinated as compared to unvaccinated patients had lower readmissions (13.8% vs. 21.51%) and post-COVID pulmonary complications (15.4% vs. 24.2%). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, co-morbidity, and disease severity, lack of vaccination was found to be an independent predictor of long COVID with an Odds ratio of 2.42(95% CI 1.52-3.84). Fully and partially vaccinated patients had 62% and 56% reduced risk of developing long COVID respectively.

Air ions can reduce viable bacteria, mold, and virus counts, however, most studies use small test enclosures with target microbes and ion sources in close vicinity. To evaluate ion performance in real-world spaces, experiments were conducted in a large, room-size BSL-3 Chamber. Negative and positive ions were delivered simultaneously using a commercially available bipolar air ion device. The device housed Needle Point Bipolar ionization (NPBI) technology. Large chamber studies often use unrealistically high virus concentrations to ensure measurable virus is present at the trial end. However, excessively high viral concentrations bias air cleaning devices towards underperformance. Hence, devices that provide a substantial impact for protecting occupants in real-world spaces with real-world virus concentrations are often dismissed as poor performers. Herein, both real-world and excessive virus concentrations were studied using Influenza A and B, Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta strains. The average ion concentrations ranged from 4,100 to 24,000 per polarity over 60-minute and 30-minute time trials. The reduction rate was considerably greater for trials that used real-world virus concentrations, reducing infectivity for Influenza A and B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 Delta by 88.3-99.98% in 30 minutes, whereas trials using in-excess concentrations showed 49.5-61.2% in 30 minutes.

Although COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory disease, it can affect other organ systems causing a lot of extrapulmonary manifestations and multiple organ dysfunctions. The aim of the study is to discover if COVID-19 affects male reproductive hormones (testosterone and luteinizing hormone) or not, and whether this effect (if present) is negatively associated with the severity of the disease. In this prospective case-control study we recruited 120 reproductive-aged male patients, they represent group (A) which is subdivided into 3 groups according to the severity of the disease (mild, moderate, and severe). A control group consisting of another 120 age-matched males was randomly selected and they represent group (B). The hormone profile of the diseased group is then compared to that of the control group. The testosterone/LH ratio of both groups was calculated and compared. The age of cases had a mean of 41.96+-10.18 and that of the control was 41.85+-10.2 years. The age distribution of both groups did not show significant statistical differences (0.937). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerably lower levels of total blood testosterone (P=0.043) and T/LH ratio (P value 0.0001) compared to the control group, although serum LH levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P value 0.0001). Conclusions: In addition to the hematological, biochemical, inflammatory, and immune biomarkers abnormality in patients with COVID-19, the current study demonstrated that total testosterone level, LH level, and T/LH ratio might be affected by the disease according to severity.

Moral distress is associated with a host of adverse psychological and functional outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and functional impairment) and consideration of position departure. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of moral distress and its associated psychological and functional outcomes on consideration to leave a clinical position among Canadian RTs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Canadian RTs (N = 213) completed an online survey between February and June 2021. Basic demographic information (e.g. age, sex, gender) and psychometrically validated measures of moral distress, depression, anxiety, stress, PTSD, dissociation, functional impairment, resilience and adverse childhood experiences were collected. RESULTS: One in four RTs reported considering leaving their position. RTs considering leaving reported elevated levels of moral distress and adverse psychological and functional outcomes compared to RTs not considering leaving. Over half (54.5%) of those considering leaving scored above the cut-off for potential diagnosis of PTSD. Previous consideration to leave a position and having left a position in the past each significantly increased the odds of currently considering leaving, along with system-related moral distress and symptoms of PTSD, but the contribution of these latter factors was small. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian RTs considering leaving their position reported elevated levels of distress and adverse psychological and functional outcomes, yet these individual-level factors appear unlikely to be the primary factors underlying RTs' consideration to leave, because their effects were small. Further research is required to identify broader, organizational factors that may contribute to consideration of position departure among Canadian RTs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 290, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 401, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 507, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 519, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "posttraumatic stress disorder", "locations": [{"offset": 540, "length": 29}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "PTSD", "locations": [{"offset": 571, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 851, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 1074, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1086, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 1095, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "PTSD", "locations": [{"offset": 1103, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "PTSD", "locations": [{"offset": 1534, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013313", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "PTSD", "locations": [{"offset": 1751, "length": 4}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991889, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D001007", "disease@MESH:D000275", "disease@MESH:D013313", "disease@MESH:D000079225", "species@9606"], "journal": "Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can", "year": 2023, "authors": ["D'Alessandro-Lowe AM", "Ritchie K", "Brown A", "Easterbrook B", "Xue Y", "Pichtikova M", "Altman M", "Beech I", "Millman H", "Foster F", "Hassall K", "Levy Y", "Streiner DL", "Hosseiny F", "Rodrigues S", "Heber A", "O'Connor C", "Schielke H", "Malain A", "McCabe RE", "Lanius RA", "McKinnon MC"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Importantly, the DNA@COS nanoparticle vaccine loaded in an MN patch can be stored at room temperature for at least 1 month without a significant decrease of its immunogenicity.

There are 2 main types of breast reconstruction: alloplastic (using implants) and autologous (using the patient's own tissue). The latter creates a more natural breast mound and avoids the long-term need for surgical revision-more often associated with implant-based surgery. The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is considered the gold standard approach in autologous breast reconstruction. However, complications do occur with DIEP flap surgery and can stem from poor flap tissue perfusion/oxygenation. Hence, the development of strategies to enhance flap perfusion (eg, goal-directed perioperative fluid therapy) is essential. Current perioperative fluid therapy is traditionally guided by subjective criteria, which leads to wide variations in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this trial is to determine whether the use of minimally invasive cardiac output (CO) monitoring for guiding intravenous fluid administration, combined with low-dose dobutamine infusion (via a treatment algorithm), will increase tissue oxygenation in patients undergoing DIEP flap surgery. METHODS: With appropriate institutional ethics board and Health Canada approval, patients undergoing DIEP flap surgery are randomly assigned to receive CO monitoring for the guidance of intraoperative fluid therapy in addition to a low-dose dobutamine infusion (which potentially improves flap oxygenation) versus the current standard of care. The primary outcome is tissue oxygenation measured via near-infrared spectroscopy at the perfusion zone furthest from the perforator vessels 45 minutes after vascular reanastomosis of the DIEP flap. Low dose (2.5 mug/kg/hr) dobutamine infusion continues for up to 4 hours postoperatively, provided there are no associated complications (ie, persistent tachycardia). Flap oxygenation, hemodynamic parameters, and any medication-associated side effects/complications are monitored for up to 48 hours postoperatively. Complications, rehospitalizations, and patient satisfaction are also collected until 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Funding and regulatory approvals were obtained in 2019, but the study recruitment was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of October 4, 2023, 34 participants have been recruited. Because of the significant delays associated with the pandemic, the expected completion date was extended. We expect the study to be completed and ready for potential news release (as appropriate) and publication by July 2024. No patients have suffered any adverse effects/complications from participating in this study, and none have been lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CO-directed fluid therapy in combination with a low-dose dobutamine infusion via a treatment algorithm has the potential to improve DIEP flap tissue oxygenation and reduce complications following DIEP flap breast reconstruction surgery. However, given that the investigators remain blinded to group randomization, no comment can be made regarding the efficacy of this intervention for improving tissue oxygenation at this time. Nevertheless, no patients have been withdrawn for safety concerns thus far, and compliance remains high.

Objective: To compare overall rates, COVID-19 PHE-related changes, and child and family characteristics associated with inconsistent and inadequate coverage for publicly and commercially insured children. Design, Settings, and Participants: This was a cross-sectional study using nationally representative data from the 2016 to 2021 National Survey of Children's Health of children from age 0 to 17 years living in noninstitutional settings. Exposure: Parent- or caregiver-reported current child health insurance type defined as public or commercial. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inconsistent insurance, defined as having an insurance gap in the past year; and inadequate insurance, defined by failure to meet 3 criteria: (1) benefits usually/always sufficient to meet child's needs; (2) coverage usually/always allows child to access needed health care practitioners; and (3) no or usually/always reasonable annual out-of-pocket payments for child's health care. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to compare outcomes by insurance type, by year (2020-2021 vs 2016-2019), and by child characteristics within insurance type. Results: Of this nationally representative sample of 203 691 insured children, 34.5% were publicly insured (mean [SD] age, 8.4 [4.1] years; 47.4% female) and 65.5% were commercially insured (mean [SD] age, 8.7 [5.6]; 49.1% female). Most publicly insured children were either non-Hispanic Black (20.9%) or Hispanic (36.4%); living with 2 married parents (38.4%) or a single parent (33.1%); and had a household income less than 200% of the federal poverty level (79%). Most commercially insured children were non-Hispanic White (62.8%), living with 2 married parents (79.0%); and had a household income of 400% of the federal poverty level or higher (49.1%). Compared with commercially insured children, publicly insured children had higher rates of inconsistent coverage (4.2% vs 1.4%; difference, 2.7 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, 2.3 to 3.2) and lower rates of inadequate coverage (12.2% vs 33.0%; difference, -20.8 pp; 95% CI, -21.6 to -20.0). Compared with the period from 2016 to 2019, inconsistent insurance decreased by 42% for publicly insured children and inadequate insurance decreased by 6% for commercially insured children during the COVID-19 PHE (2020-2021). The child and family characteristics associated with inadequate and inconsistent insurance varied by insurance type. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study indicate that insurance gaps are a particular problem for publicly insured children, whereas insurance inadequacy and particularly, out-of-pocket costs are a challenge for commercially insured children. Both challenges improved during the COVID-19 PHE. Improving children's health coverage after the PHE will require policy solutions that target the unique needs of commercially and publicly insured children.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 132, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040798", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PHE", "locations": [{"offset": 166, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 206, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 343, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040798", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PHE", "locations": [{"offset": 352, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 377, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 501, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 533, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 658, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 679, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 796, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1074, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1124, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1248, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 1394, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1508, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1693, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1932, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2131, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2158, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2492, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2567, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2587, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040798", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PHE", "locations": [{"offset": 2596, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 2617, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2875, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 2993, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 3039, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040798", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PHE", "locations": [{"offset": 3048, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 3063, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C040798", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PHE", "locations": [{"offset": 3100, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 3200, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991782, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:C040798", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "JAMA Health Forum", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Daw JR", "Yekta S", "Jacobson-Davies FE", "Patrick SW", "Admon LK"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Objective: To examine individual sociodemographic characteristics and residing county's health care resources and socioeconomic factors among pregnancy-associated overdose decedents in comparison with obstetric decedents and overdose decedents who were not pregnant in the past year. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, exploratory study included 1457 pregnant and postpartum overdose decedents, 4796 obstetric decedents, and 11 205 nonpregnant overdose decedents aged 10 to 44 years from 2018 to 2021. Data were analyzed August 2023. Exposures: Decedents from the 2018-2021 Multiple Cause of Death Files linked to the 2021 Area Health Resources Files and the 2018-2021 County Health Rankings data at the county level. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pregnancy-associated deaths were defined as deaths during pregnancy or within 1 year of pregnancy termination. This study focused on unintentional drug overdoses or drug overdoses with undetermined intent involving the most common psychotropic drugs of misuse. Results: From 2018 to 2021, across the pregnancy-postpartum continuum, pregnancy-associated overdose mortality ratios consistently increased among women aged 10 to 44 years. Mortality ratio more than tripled among pregnant and postpartum women aged 35 to 44 years from 4.9 (95% CI, 3.0-8.0) per 100 000 mothers aged 35 to 44 years with a live birth in January to June 2018 to 15.8 (95% CI, 12.3-20.4) in July to December 2021 (average semiannual percentage changes, 15.9; 95% CI, 8.7-23.6; P < .001). Compared with pregnant obstetric decedents, pregnant overdose decedents had increased odds of being aged 10 to 34 years (75.4% vs 59.5%; range of odds ratios [ORs], 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.5] for ages 10 to 24 years to 2.2 [95% CI, 1.7-2.8] for ages 25 to 34 years), being non-college graduates (72.1% vs 59.4%; range of ORs, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.7-4.3] for those with some college education to 3.9 [95% CI, 2.4-6.1] for those with less than high school education), being unmarried (88.0% vs 62.1%; OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.7-6.0), and dying in nonhome, non-health care settings (25.9% vs 4.5%; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8-3.6) and were associated with decreased odds of dying in health care settings (34.7% vs 77.6%; range of ORs, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1-0.1] for those who died in hospital inpatient settings to 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3-0.6] for those who died in hospital outpatient/emergency room settings). Conclusions and Relevance: From 2018 to 2021, the mortality ratio more than tripled among pregnant and postpartum women aged 35 to 44 years, consistent with increases in overdose mortality across US populations. Most pregnancy-associated overdose deaths occurred outside health care settings, indicating the need for strengthening community outreach and maternal medical support. To reduce pregnancy-associated overdose mortality, evidence-based interventions are urgently needed at individual, health care, local, and national levels, along with nonpunitive approaches incentivizing pregnant and postpartum women to seek substance use disorder treatments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 371, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 433, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 513, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 605, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 674, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Death", "locations": [{"offset": 822, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 997, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1020, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "drug overdoses", "locations": [{"offset": 1123, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "drug overdoses", "locations": [{"offset": 1141, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 1329, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1338, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1384, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1411, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1475, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 1791, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "outpatient", "locations": [{"offset": 2574, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 2661, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2725, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 2781, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 2790, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 2849, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D062787", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "overdose", "locations": [{"offset": 3022, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 3031, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 3219, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991773, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D062787", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D003643"], "journal": "JAMA Psychiatry", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Han B", "Compton WM", "Einstein EB", "Elder E", "Volkow ND"]}

This pilot involved a mock GMP inspection of a drug manufacturing facility in the United States.

Harmonized inspectional guidance from PIC/s (GMP Guide) and WHO (TRS 823) were used as the standards for conducting the mock inspection.

In 2020 the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic caused several concerns about the use of saliva, due to the risk of contamination, and a European consensus further discourage using salivary cortisol. To decrease infectious risk, we handled specimens by applying a heat treatment to inactivate viral particles, further evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of salivary cortisol in clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Saliva samples were exposed for 10 min at 70  C, then cortisol was measured using LC-MS/MS. The number of salivary cortisol examinations from 2013 to 2022 was extracted from the local electronic database: those performed in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were analyzed and compared with the historical data. RESULTS: During 2020 we observed a decrease of 408 (-20%) examinations (p = 0.05) compared to 2019; especially in salivary cortisol daily rhythm and salivary cortisol/cortisone ratio (respectively reduction of 47% and 88%, p = 0.003 and p = 0.001). Analyzing year 2021 compared with 2020 we reported an increase of 420 examinations (+20%, p = 0.01), with a complete recovery of salivary cortisol measurement (considering 2019: p = 0.71). Major differences were observed between morning salivary cortisol (-20%, p = 0.017), LNSC (-21%, p = 0.012) and salivary cortisol rhythm (-22%, p = 0.056).

Vaccine hesitancy challenges broad immunization coverage. We deployed a cross-national survey to investigate knowledge, beliefs, and behaviours toward continued COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We administered a national, cross-sectional online survey among adults in Canada between March 16 and March 26, 2022. We utilized descriptive statistics to summarize our sample, and tested for demographic differences, perceptions of vaccine effectiveness, recommended doses, and trust in decisions, using the Rao-Scott correction for weighted chi-squared tests. Multivariable logistic regression was adjusted for relevant covariates to identify sociodemographic factors and beliefs associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We collected 2202 completed questionnaires. Lower education status (high school: odds ratio (OR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29, 2.81) and having children (OR 1.89, CI 1.39, 2.57) were associated with increased odds of experiencing hesitancy toward a booster dose, while higher income ($100,000-$149,999: OR 0.60, CI 0.39, 0.91; $150,000 or more: OR 0.49, CI 0.29, 0.82) was associated with decreased odds. Disbelief in vaccine effectiveness (against infection: OR 3.69, CI 1.98, 6.90; serious illness: OR 3.15, CI 1.69, 5.86), disagreeing with government decision-making (somewhat disagree: OR 2.70, CI 1.38, 5.29; strongly disagree: OR 4.62, CI 2.20, 9.7), and beliefs in over-vaccinating (OR 2.07, CI 1.53, 2.80) were found associated with booster dose hesitancy.

Accordingly, transcriptome analysis was used to detect the shared pathways and molecular biomarkers in TB and COVID-19, allowing us to determine the complex relationship between COVID-19 and TB. Two RNA-seq datasets (GSE114192 and GSE163151) from the Gene Expression Omnibus were used to find concerted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TB and COVID-19 to identify the common pathogenic mechanisms. A total of 124 common DEGs were detected and used to find shared pathways and drug targets. Several enterprising bioinformatics tools were applied to perform pathway analysis, enrichment analysis and networks analysis. Protein-protein interaction analysis and machine learning was used to identify hub genes (GAS6, OAS3 and PDCD1LG2) and datasets GSE171110, GSE54992 and GSE79362 were used for verification.

Here we show that Lys417 in the RBD plays dual roles in the spike's structure: it stabilizes the closed conformation of the trimeric spike by mediating inter-spike-subunit interactions; it also directly interacts with ACE2 receptor. Hence, a K417V mutation has opposing effects on the spike's function: it opens up the spike for better ACE2 binding while weakening the RBD's direct binding to ACE2. The net outcomes of this mutation are to allow the spike to bind ACE2 with higher probability, mediate viral entry more efficiently, but become more exposed to neutralizing antibodies.

The key viral protein for cell infection is the spike glycoprotein, a surface-exposed fusion protein that both recognizes and mediates entry into host cells. Within the spike glycoprotein, a fatty acid binding pocket (FABP) was confirmed, with the crystallization of linoleic acid (LA) occupying a well-defined site. Importantly, when the pocket is occupied by a fatty acid, an inactive conformation is stabilized, and cell recognition is hindered. In this review, we discuss ligands reported so far for this site, correlating their activity predicted through in silico studies with antispike experimental activity, assessed by either binding assays or cell-infection assays. LA was the first confirmed ligand, cocrystallized in a cryo-EM structure of the spike protein, resulting in increased stability of the inactive conformation of the spike protein. The next identified ligand, lifitegrast, was also experimentally confirmed as a ligand with antiviral activity, suggesting the potential for diverse chemical scaffolds to bind this site. Finally, SPC-14 was also confirmed as a ligand, although no inhibition assays were performed. In this review, we identified 20 studies describing small-molecule compounds predicted to bind the pocket in in silico studies and with confirmed binding or in vitro activity, either inhibitory activity against the spike-ACE2 interaction or antiviral activity in cell-based assays. When considering all ligands confirmed with in vitro assays, a good overall occupation of the pocket should be complemented with the ability to make direct interactions, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, with key amino acid residues defining the pocket surface. Among the active compounds, long flexible carbon chains are recurrent, with retinoids capable of binding the FABP, although bulkier systems are also capable of affecting viral fitness. Compounds able to bind this site with high affinity have the potential to stabilize the inactive conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and therefore reduce the virus's ability to infect new cells. Since this pocket is conserved in highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, this effect could be exploited for the development of new antiviral agents, with broad-spectrum anticoronavirus activity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 144, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 19", "locations": [{"offset": 195, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 219, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 317, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005227", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "fatty acid", "locations": [{"offset": 477, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008041", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "linoleic acid", "locations": [{"offset": 553, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005227", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "fatty acid", "locations": [{"offset": 649, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 944, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 1643, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002244", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "carbon", "locations": [{"offset": 2008, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012176", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "retinoids", "locations": [{"offset": 2042, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "viral fitness", "locations": [{"offset": 2136, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 2268, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 2407, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronaviruses", "locations": [{"offset": 2413, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "1335626", "type": "Species"}, "text": "MERS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 2438, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 2451, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991468, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:D005227", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "species@694009", "gene@59272", "species@11118", "species@1335626", "disease@MESH:D007239", "chemical@MESH:D008041", "species@9606", "chemical@MESH:D012176", "species@2697049", "chemical@MESH:D002244"], "journal": "J Chem Inf Model", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Queir&#xf3;s-Reis L", "Mesquita JR", "Brancale A", "Bassetto M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

While a great deal of univariate data analysis approaches have been developed to address the issue, strategies for assessing interaction patterns of differential expression are scarce in the literature and have been limited to ad hoc solutions. This paper contributes to the problem by exploiting the facilities of an ensemble learning algorithm like random forests to propose a measure that assesses the differential expression explained by the interaction of the omic variables so subtle biological patterns may be uncovered as a result. The out of bag error rate, which is an estimate of the predictive accuracy of a random forests classifier, is used as a by-product to propose a new measure that assesses interaction patterns of differential expression. Its performance is studied in synthetic scenarios and it is also applied to real studies on SARS-CoV-2 and colon cancer data where it uncovers associations that remain undetected by other methods.

Studies with robust control groups and high response rates have been few. METHODS: We obtained identifiers for all 837 Icelandic children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by PCR between March 2020 and June 2021 and contacted them by telephone. We asked about 10 physical and mental symptoms being present at least twice weekly for at least 2 months. Participants who reported symptoms were contacted again a year later. For each subject who completed the questionnaire, an age- and sex-matched comparator without SARS-CoV-2 infection was asked to complete the same questionnaire, and the risk difference was calculated. RESULTS: Responses from 643 cases and 602 comparators were analyzed. Children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to report one or more symptoms, except for anxiety/depression and sleep disturbances. Fatigue and loss of concentration were evidently more common in cases among teenagers (risk difference: 15%; 95% CI: 7-22% and 15%; 95% CI: 7-23%, respectively).

Despite these concerns, limited hospital-based and comprehensive pediatric data have been published on MIS-C in Brazilian children. METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of the MIS-C scores in 16 public and private hospitals providing secondary and tertiary care in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and demographic information were systematically extracted from the electronic medical records of each patient. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the combined effects of MIS-C phenotype, disease severity and comorbidity as dependent variables. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients met the MIS-C criteria and were evaluated. The median age was 67 months, 60% were male, 28.7% were black or afrodescendant and 62.3% were admitted to public hospitals. Underlying medical conditions were observed in 16.8% of patients and were associated with a longer duration of hospitalization. A Kawasaki disease-like phenotype was observed in 43.5% of patients, and they demonstrated a trend of lower median age. Children with severe MIS-C were older (median age 91 months vs. 36 months) and had a nonspecific phenotype, more cardiovascular and respiratory involvement and kidney injury; 73.3% required intensive care, 20.8% required mechanical ventilation and 35.6% required inotropic support. Four deaths occurred (CFR = 3.9%), three of which were in healthy participants. CONCLUSION: We identified a lower median age, particularly among children with Kawasaki disease-like phenotypes, those with a significant need for intensive care, and a high CFR in MIS-C.

PURPOSE: To compare the performance of postgraduate year 4 prepandemic (2018-2019) and pandemic (2021-2022) ophthalmology residents. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was an observational comparative study conducted at a university-based hospital. METHODS: Ophthalmology residents of postgraduate year 4 during prepandemic (2018-2019) and pandemic (2021-2022) time periods were included. The performances of residents in phacoemulsification were scored by a single faculty assessor using the International Council of Ophthalmology's Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric for phacoemulsification (ICO-OSCAR: phaco). The scores were compared between the two groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The comparisons between the pre- and post-pandemic groups were performed using the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Seventy-one surgeries were rated in each group. All task-specific and global scores of the pandemic group were lower than those of the prepandemic group (all P values < 0.001). The maximum intergroup difference was in capsulorrhexis circular completion (difference of 1.21 score, P < 0.001) and tissue handling (difference of 1.21 score, P < 0.001) among task-specific and global scores, respectively. The residents of the two groups had the highest similarity in irrigation and aspiration (difference of 0.61 score, P < 0.001) from task-specific scores and central eye position from global scores (difference of 0.93 score, P < 0.001).

METHODS: A total of 35 patients of ROCM associated with COVID-19 (active and post-COVID-19) were included. This is an ambispective study with retrospective medical records review for COVID-19 analysis and prospective assessments of ROCM-associated COVID-19 during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The demographic data, clinical parameters, and outcome were recorded on MS excel sheet, and various parameters were compared between active and recovered COVID-19 groups. RESULTS: ROCM in recovered COVID-19 group was higher (57.1%) as compared to active COVID-19 (42.9%) (P = 1.00). High occurrence of ROCM was seen in those who had a history of hospitalization due to severity of COVID-19 (n 33, 94.28%), oxygen support (77.14), and received systemic steroids (82.9%). The most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (82.9%), and new-onset hyperglycemia was noticed in 17.1% of patients. Exenteration (28.6%) was performed in severe cases who had stage IV ROCM, bilateral, and CNS involvement (RR = 7.2, 95% CI: 2.91 to 18.00). The risk of globe exenteration was 1.35 (0.7-2.29) times higher in recovered COVID-19 group, and mortality was 1.76 (0.72-3.36) times higher in active COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: Monitored use of systemic steroids and the prompt management of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients are important factors for favorable outcomes with reference to globe salvage and life-saving in ROCM associated with COVID-19.

Grounded on a Grow-Your-Own (GYO) approach, UI Health CHAMPIONS spearheaded the development of the COVID-19 Youth Ambassador Program (COVID-19 YAP), a virtual multistage and multipartner effort. Its mission is to equip youth with knowledge, perspective, and tools to have empathetic, informative conversations within their networks about COVID-19. Via e-learning, modules cover viruses and the immune system; vaccine development; health disparities/equity; and health advocacy. Participants are introduced to Human-Centered Design Thinking to guide the development of advocacy projects. COVID-19 YAP's uniqueness lies in the team of program coordinators consisting of (pre-)health professional student workers with a desire to engage in health equity efforts and community health ambassadorship. Freirean principles are applied across program design and delivery; Dialogical Education encourages the educator to become the student and the student to become an educator. This co-learning process empowers students and educators to become agents of social change.

Therefore, in this study we investigated the factors influencing guardians' decision-making regarding vaccination of their children. METHODS: From November 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, pediatric clinics, departments, and midwifery clinics in Saitama Prefecture requested guardians of children under the age of 15 to complete an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 894 guardians of children aged 6 months to 15 years; 142 had had one of their children vaccinated at least once and 629 had not had any of their children vaccinated. Among guardians who had not had any of their children vaccinated, \"the Age of children\" was significantly younger (p < 0.001) and \"Prevalence\" (p < 0.001), \"Free vaccination\" (p < 0.001), and \"Intentions of national and local governments\" (p = 0.005) were selected as reasons significantly less frequently in comparison to guardians who had vaccinated their children. \"Japanese adverse reactions\" (p < 0.001), \"Japanese effectiveness\" (p < 0.001), \"Adverse reactions\" (p < 0.001), \"History of adverse reactions\" (p < 0.001), and \"Reputation of friends\" (p = 0.006) were selected significantly more frequently by guardians who had not had any of their children vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Guardians who had had one of their children vaccinated at least once emphasized the importance of prevalence and free vaccination. On the other hand, guardians who had not had any of their children vaccinated placed particular importance on adverse reactions and the Japanese data on effectiveness.

The present analysis studies the impact of pandemic and prepandemic conditions in terms of mortality on Sardinian health service organizational subunits to indirectly investigate the need for specific social and health interventions. Design: Retrospective observational mortality study on the Sardinian resident population, surveyed by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) from 2017 to 2021. Methods: The database was built by crossing demographic data from the Istat divided into 21 five-year age groups (0-4 to 100+). Mortality and excess mortality were calculated with a focus on local health authorities and districts. The analysis were made considering three age groups (0-64, >= 65, 0-100+) and comparing the individual years 2020 and 2021 with the pre-pandemic triennium 2017-2019. To better understand the phenomenon of excess mortality, the old age index was calculated for the Local Health Authority and District for each year of the quinquennium considered. Results: Standardized mortality ratios increased in the biennium of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compared to the baseline 2017-2019. A global increaseof the Standardized mortality ratios in all districts (2021) was measured, including those with Standardized mortality ratios already increasing in 2020. Notably, the Standardized mortality ratios (2020 and 2021) were often increased by the 0-64 age group. The regional excess mortality (0-100+) confirmed an increase in mortality compared to the baseline, with a slight decrease from 2020 to 2021. Conclusions: Sardinia presents peculiar demographic and geographical characteristics. Monitoring mortality rates and excess mortality confirms to be crucial to constantly re-modulating health interventions and planning of the supply of services, including the equitable allocation of resources based on actual health needs. Sardinia should embrace the concept of \"age-friendly community\" and create communities designed to promote active aging and social participation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 520, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 699, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 965, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 986, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "triennium", "locations": [{"offset": 1213, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1280, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "quinquennium", "locations": [{"offset": 1389, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1436, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1486, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1579, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1668, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1739, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1836, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1880, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 2055, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 2082, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991174, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:C587222", "species@2697049", "disease@MESH:D003643"], "journal": "Ann Ig", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Pani SM", "Cadoni F", "Minerba L"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate factors associated with quality of life and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes 12 months after hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study intends to enroll 611 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 (NCT05165979). Centralized telephone interviews are scheduled to occur at three, six, nine, and 12 months after hospital discharge. The primary endpoint is defined as the health-related quality-of-life utility score assessed by the EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 12 months. Secondary endpoints are defined as the EQ-5D-3L at three, six and nine months, return to work or education, persistent symptoms, new disabilities in instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, major cardiovascular events, rehospitalization, as well as all-cause mortality at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A p-value <0.05 will be assumed as statistically significant for all analyses. RESULTS: The primary endpoint will be presented as the frequency of the EQ-5D-3L score 12 months after COVID-19 hospitalization. A sub-analysis to identify possible associations of independent variables with study outcomes will be presented.

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of pediatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study involving unvaccinated children and adolescents admitted to a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were collected from electronic medical records for one year after the diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 66 children were included: the median age was 2.9 years; 63.6% were male; and 48.5% were under 2 years of age. Over 70% had at least one comorbidity prior to the COVID-19 diagnosis. During the one-year follow-up period, 59.1% of the children revisited the emergency department, 50% required readmission, and 15.2% died. Younger children with longer hospital stays were found to be at greater risk of readmission. Having cancer and impaired functionality were found to increase the risk of death within one year. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that most children hospitalized with COVID-19 have comorbidities. Younger age at admission and a longer hospital stay seem to be risk factors for readmission. In addition, the presence of cancer and impaired functionality are apparently associated with the poor outcome of death within the first year after the diagnosis of COVID-19.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 157, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 281, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 308, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 386, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 469, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 598, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 757, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 828, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 923, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1015, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 1084, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1152, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1179, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1330, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 1415, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1466, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991071, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D009369"], "journal": "J Bras Pneumol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Schmidt CJ", "Casassola GM", "Affeldt GH", "Morais DS", "Alvarenga LKB", "Miller C", "Ziegler B"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

To this end, two deep mutational scanning studies traced the impact of all possible mutations across receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike and catalytic domain of human ACE2. By concentrating on the interface mutations of these experimental data, we benchmarked six commonly used structure-based binding affinity predictors (FoldX, EvoEF1, MutaBind2, SSIPe, HADDOCK, and UEP). These predictors were selected based on their user-friendliness, accessibility, and speed. As a result of our benchmarking efforts, we observed that none of the methods could generate a meaningful correlation with the experimental binding data. The best correlation is achieved by FoldX (R = -0.51). When we simplified the prediction problem to a binary classification, that is, whether a mutation is enriching or depleting the binding, we showed that the highest accuracy is achieved by FoldX with a 64% success rate. Surprisingly, on this set, simple energetic scoring functions performed significantly better than the ones using extra evolutionary-based terms, as in Mutabind and SSIPe. Furthermore, we demonstrated that recent AI approaches, mmCSM-PPI and TopNetTree, yielded comparable performances to the force field-based techniques. These observations suggest plenty of room to improve the binding affinity predictors in guessing the variant-induced binding profile changes of a host-pathogen system, such as Spike-ACE2.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common Disorders of the Gut-Brain Interaction and its post-infection development is already validated. According to the Rome IV criteria, it is characterized by the presence of recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day a week in the last 3 months with onset of symptoms at least 6 months before diagnosis, associated with 2 or more factors: related to defecation and/or associated with change in stool frequency and/or associated with change in stool form. This study aimed to review data on post-COVID-19 IBS. METHODS: this is an integrative review of studies published between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2023, which presented data on IBS with previously diagnosed COVID-19 disease. The PubMed database was used, the descriptors were \"Irritable bowel syndrome\" AND \"COVID-19\"; the reference list of the articles was also retrieved. RESULTS: eight studies were reviewed, it was observed that 0.6% to 11.6% of patients had IBS again after a minimum period of 6 months of infection. Risk factors were female gender, severity of COVID-19, presence of acute-phase gastrointestinal symptoms, and depression/anxiety. CONCLUSION: the results obtained suggest that COVID-19 may be associated with the emergence of de novo IBS. Further studies are needed to investigate its long-term effects and clinical spectra.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 118, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 229, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome", "locations": [{"offset": 239, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "IBS", "locations": [{"offset": 265, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 348, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D015746", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "abdominal pain", "locations": [{"offset": 476, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 797, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "IBS", "locations": [{"offset": 806, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "IBS", "locations": [{"offset": 939, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 969, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome", "locations": [{"offset": 1039, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1070, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1212, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "IBS", "locations": [{"offset": 1225, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1273, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1329, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012817", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "gastrointestinal symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1363, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 1394, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 1405, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1460, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D043183", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "IBS", "locations": [{"offset": 1517, "length": 3}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991064, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D015746", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D012817", "disease@MESH:D043183", "disease@MESH:D001007", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D000275", "species@9606"], "journal": "Rev Col Bras Cir", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Silva JTC", "Fonseca Neto OCLD"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Objectives: (1) to describe HHAs and administrators' perspectives related to COVID-19 vaccination messaging, and (2) to co-design a Communication Toolkit to create COVID-19 vaccine messages. Methods: HHAs and administrators from 4 geographically diverse Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) hospice agencies were recruited for a multi-method process involving qualitative interviews (17 HHAs and 5 administrators), community engagement (CE) studios, and development of a Communication Toolkit. Interviews were guided by the PEN-3 conceptual framework to explore barriers and facilitators to vaccination. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Despite power differences, HHAs and administrators share a commitment to protecting patients affected by serious illness. HHAs desire vaccine messaging that includes personal narratives, good news about the vaccine, and facts about benefits and risks of the vaccine. Preferred message formats include the agency intranet, daily briefings, or \"little seeds\" (ie, short, high-impact information). Through the studios, HHAs provided input on a Toolkit prototype with messages tailored to the context of home care. Conclusions: Grounded in the commitment of HHAs and administrators to protecting vulnerable patients, we co-created an adaptable Communication Toolkit to address COVID-19 vaccination misinformation and mistrust among direct care workers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 113, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 143, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 179, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 248, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 324, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 552, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 639, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C035086", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "PEN", "locations": [{"offset": 1006, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1234, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020018", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "HHAs desire", "locations": [{"offset": 1272, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1753, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1823, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37991051, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:C035086", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D020018"], "journal": "Am J Hosp Palliat Care", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Lum HD", "Fischer S", "Ytell K", "Scherer L", "O'Leary ST", "Elk R", "Hurley S", "Washington KT", "DeCamp M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Goals of management include stabilizing the patient, treating or controlling infections, and decreasing the risk of reactivation of infection after transplant. RECENT FINDINGS: Groups such as The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases have updated their guidelines on screening and treatment of infection in transplant candidates. There are also recent developments in therapeutic options for tuberculosis, COVID-19, Clostridioides difficile colitis, bloodstream infections, and other common infections. SUMMARY: Ideally, antimicrobial therapy should be complete prior to transplantation. In situations in which completion of therapy prior to transplant is not feasible, therapy may need to be prolonged or modified. In most situations, infections can be managed similarly to the general population, although some infections, particularly fungal and mycobacterial, require a different management approach.

Furthermore, the spatial structure of antigens plays a critical role in immune studies and immunotherapy, which should be addressed properly in the identification of interacting TCR-antigen pairs. In this study, we introduced a novel deep learning framework based on generative graph structures, GGNpTCR, for predicting interactions between TCR and peptides from sequence information. Results of real data analysis indicate that our model achieved excellent prediction for new antigens unseen in the training data set, making significant improvements compared to existing methods. We also applied the model to a large COVID-19 data set with no antigens in the training data set, and the improvement was also significant. Furthermore, through incorporation of additional supervised mechanisms, GGNpTCR demonstrated the ability to precisely forecast the locations of peptide-TCR interactions within 3D configurations.

RESULTS: Overall, 49% of surveys were completed during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 winter wave and 51% were completed during severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) delta (delta)/ (omicron) waves, with a relatively even distribution of certified nursing assistants, licensed vocational or registered nurses, and nonfrontline staff. Most COVID-19 cases (71%) were detected during mandated weekly NH surveillance testing and most staff (67%) had >=1 symptom prior to their test. Only 34% of those with symptoms disclosed their symptom to a supervisor. Responses were consistent across 8 discrete survey constructs with Cronbach alpha > 0.70. In the first wave of the pandemic, fear and lack of knowledge were drivers of symptom reporting. In later waves, adequate staffing and sick days were drivers of symptom reporting. COVID-19 help lines and encouragement from supervisors facilitated symptom reporting and testing. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory COVID-19 testing for NH staff is key to identifying staff COVID-19 cases due to reluctance to speak up about existing symptoms. Active encouragement from supervisors to report symptoms and stay home when ill was a major driver of symptom reporting and resultant infection prevention and worker safety measures.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 208, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 234, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000641", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NH", "locations": [{"offset": 273, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 425, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000641", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NH", "locations": [{"offset": 462, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 476, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000641", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NH", "locations": [{"offset": 537, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 556, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 912, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 988, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1009, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1193, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000641", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NH", "locations": [{"offset": 1251, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1676, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1797, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000641", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NH", "locations": [{"offset": 1818, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1855, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2059, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990904, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "chemical@MESH:D000641", "species@11118", "disease@MESH:D007239", "species@9606", "species@2697049"], "journal": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Gussin GM", "Singh RD", "Tjoa TT", "Saavedra R", "Kaplan SH", "Huang SS"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

China developed health code apps as an emergency response to the pandemic with plans to use them for broader public health services. However, potential problems within privacy policies may compromise personal information (PI) protection. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the compliance of the privacy policies of 30 health code apps in the mainland of China with the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and related specifications. Methods: We reviewed and assessed the privacy policies of 30 health code apps between August 26 and September 6, 2023. We used a 3-level indicator scale based on the information life cycle as provided in the PIPL and related specifications. The scale comprised 7 level-1 indicators, 26 level-2 indicators, and 71 level-3 indicators. Results: The mean compliance score of the 30 health code apps was 59.9% (SD 22.6%). A total of 13 (43.3%) apps scored below this average, and 6 apps scored below 40%. Level-1 indicator scores included the following: general attributes (mean 85.6%, SD 23.3%); PI collection and use (mean 66.2%, SD 22.7%); PI storage and protection (mean 63.3%, SD 30.8%); PI sharing, transfer, disclosure, and transmission (mean 57.2%, SD 27.3%); PI deletion (mean 52.2%, SD 29.4%); individual rights (mean 59.3%, SD 25.7%); and PI processor duties (mean 43.7%, SD 23.8%). Sensitive PI protection compliance (mean 51.4%, SD 26.0%) lagged behind general PI protection (mean 83.3%, SD 24.3%), with only 1 app requiring separate consent for sensitive PI processing. Additionally, 46.7% (n=14) of the apps needed separate consent for subcontracting activities, while fewer disclosed PI recipient information (n=13, 43.3%), safety precautions (n=11, 36.7%), and rules of PI transfer during specific events (n=10, 33.3%). Most privacy policies specified the PI retention period (n=23, 76.7%) and postperiod deletion or anonymization (n=22, 73.3%), but only 6.7% (n=2) were committed to prompt third-party PI deletion. Most apps delineated various individual rights: the right to inquire (n=25, 83.3%), correct (n=24, 80%), and delete PI (n=24, 80%); cancel their account (n=21, 70%); withdraw consent (n=20, 60%); and request privacy policy explanations (n=24, 80%). Only a fraction addressed the rights to obtain copies (n=4, 13.3%) or refuse advertisement of automated decision-making (n=1, 3.3%). The mean compliance rate of PI processor duties was only 43.7% (SD 23.8%), with significant deficiencies in impact assessments (mean 5.0%, SD 19.8%), PI protection officer appointment (mean 6.7%, SD 24.9%), regular compliance audits (mean 6.7%, SD 24.9%), and complaint management (mean 37.8%, SD 39.2%). Conclusions: Our analysis revealed both strengths and significant shortcomings in the compliance of privacy policies of health code apps with the PIPL and related specifications considering the information life cycle. As China contemplates the future extended use of health code apps, it should articulate the legitimacy of the apps' normalization and ensure that users provide informed consent. Meanwhile, China should raise the compliance level of relevant privacy policies and fortify its enforcement mechanisms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 263, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990813, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "JMIR Mhealth Uhealth", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Jiang J", "Zheng Z"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

DMD is the most prevalent in children. It affects dystrophin production, reducing the patient's mobility and quality of life. New technologies have become a part of physical therapy in DMD and BMD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conducting telerehabilitation through virtual reality-based games could help these children maintain their physical abilities. Objective: This study examined if the use of a virtual platform in a multimodal intervention program changes the results of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in children with DMD and BMD. The main objective was to test whether children with DMD and BMD obtain different results on the 6MWT after completing 10 telerehabilitation treatment sessions. The secondary objective was to measure whether other specific motor scales also produce different results after the 10 defined sessions. Methods: This was a descriptive, open, and quasi-experimental study with a prospective A-B (control-intervention) design. A sample of 12 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria followed the program for 5 weeks with 10 telerehabilitation sessions. During the sessions, the participants used virtual reality glasses to train for the treatment goals. All participants were assessed in person before and after the intervention. Analysis was performed using R software according to the different functional assessments performed for each test. Results: The participants showed a 19.55-meter increase in the 6MWT. Motor function also remained stable according to other scales used to assess it. The North Start Ambulatory Assessment scores were stable in both treatment conditions (P=.20). Furthermore, the timed up and go test results were 0.1 seconds faster in the telerehabilitation condition, and the Motor Function Measure in all of the 3 dimensions showed no significant differences (P=.08). Finally, the Effort Perception Infant scale showed that during the training, fatigue increased in the middle and decreased by the end of the sessions, but the perception throughout the sessions was lower even as the exercise intensity increased. Conclusions: There were no differences between conventional and telerehabilitation treatments, so the telerehabilitation tool could be used without harming children with DMD and BMD, facilitating their access to therapies and stimulating learning to maintain their functional capacity. Therefore, telerehabilitation in general may be helpful in maintaining motor function in children with DMD and BMD. The learning effect helped reduce the feeling of fatigue in the children during the program.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020388", "type": "Disease"},

METHODS: The present cross-sectional study is based on an online survey carried out in the period March-May 2020. Italian general adult population was invited to compile an anonymous survey, which included the severity of acute stress symptoms scale/National Stressful Events Survey Short Scale to investigate the occurrence and severity of ASD symptoms. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. During the lockdown, subjects with pre-existing mental health problems reported a statistically significant higher risk of acute post-traumatic symptoms compared to the general population (B: 2.57; 95% CI:2.04-3.09; p < .0001) and health care professionals (B: .37; 95% CI: .02-0.72; p < .05).

Part B aimed to evaluate the authentication systems employed by countries outside the United States to propose a model on how the vaccination card could be improved and what security features should be included for future instances requiring proof of immunization. The results revealed the CDC document was produced with minimal security features making the document prone to counterfeiting. Furthermore, based on the information collected from other countries' vaccination certificates, it is recommended to develop a dual authentication system, with digital and printable aspects, that contains a QR code linked to a database. Other security features may include a non-optical brightener substrate, security fibers, a watermarked logo, offset printing, and a geographical color-coded system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 152, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 606, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1022, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990762, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "J Forensic Sci", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Sheth D", "De Alcaraz-Fossoul J"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: We assessed 773 Slovak young adults aged 18 to 30 years, divided into subgroups on their pandemic status. Bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed by the QUS device (Sunlight MiniOmni ), and bone mineral content (BMC) and fat mass (FM) were measured by InBody 770 bioimpedance analyzer. Finally, linear regression analysis tested the associations. RESULTS: Statistically significant lower speed of sound (SOS) along the length of the forearm radius bone and Z-score values was determined in participants during the COVID-19 pandemic than before it, and statistically significant lower BMC values were observed in the male group during COVID-19 than beforehand. Regression analysis confirmed the negative pandemic effect in the following indices: SOS (p < .001 for women and p = .035 for men), Z-score (p < .001 for women and p = .003 for men), and BMC (p = .024 for men). Vitamin D was a further significant SOS predictor in women at p = .029, but this association was not detected in men. In contrast, the significant male BMC predictors were pandemic presence (p = .028), physical activity (p = .028), and fat mass percentage (p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant COVID-19 pandemic effects on bone tissue were determined on bone mass density in the radius forearm bone and the total bone mineral content. These effects establish that the pandemic had a negative impact on both their bone quality and health.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 149, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020388", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "BMD", "locations": [{"offset": 458, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 820, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 844, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 964, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1093, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1116, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1144, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1167, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1195, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014807", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Vitamin D", "locations": [{"offset": 1201, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1254, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1314, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1494, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990761, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D020388", "chemical@MESH:D014807"], "journal": "Am J Hum Biol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Falbov&#xe1; D", "Koval&#x10d;&#xed;kov&#xe1; V", "Be&#x148;u&#x161; R", "Sulis S", "Vorobe&#x13e;ov&#xe1; L"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

We report seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in two well-characterized populations in Kenya at two time points. These data inform the design and delivery of public health mitigation measures. Methods: Leveraging on existing population based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) in two demographically diverse settings, a rural site in western Kenya in Asembo, Siaya County, and an urban informal settlement in Kibera, Nairobi County, we set up a longitudinal cohort of randomly selected households with serial sampling of all consenting household members in March and June/July 2021. Both sites included 1,794 and 1,638 participants in the March and June/July 2021, respectively. Individual seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was expressed as a percentage of the seropositive among the individuals tested, accounting for household clustering and weighted by the PBIDS age and sex distribution. Results: Overall weighted individual seroprevalence increased from 56.2% (95%CI: 52.1, 60.2%) in March 2021 to 63.9% (95%CI: 59.5, 68.0%) in June 2021 in Kibera. For Asembo, the seroprevalence almost doubled from 26.0% (95%CI: 22.4, 30.0%) in March 2021 to 48.7% (95%CI: 44.3, 53.2%) in July 2021. Seroprevalence was highly heterogeneous by age and geography in these populations-higher seroprevalence was observed in the urban informal settlement (compared to the rural setting), and children aged <10 years had the lowest seroprevalence in both sites. Only 1.2% and 1.6% of the study participants reported receipt of at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by the second round of serosurvey-none by the first round.

CS is a significant contributor to the deterioration of infected individuals. Therefore, CS control is of great significance for the treatment of critically ill patients and the reduction of mortality rates. With the occurrence of variants, concerns regarding the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs with a broad spectrum have grown. We should make an effort to modernize treatment strategies to address the challenges posed by mutations. Thus, in addition to the requirement for additional clinical data to monitor the long-term effects of vaccines and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, we can use CS as an entry point and therapeutic target to alleviate the severity of the disease in patients. To effectively combat the mutation, new technologies for neutralizing or controlling CS must be developed. In recent years, nanotechnology has been widely applied in the biomedical field, opening up a plethora of opportunities for CS.

The survey covered questions relating to patient demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, symptom profile, and patient experience during acute COVID-19. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate the varying symptom profiles experienced by people in the acute stage of COVID-19 infection, with participants sharing how they managed care at home, and/or accessed medical advice. Findings also highlight themes that people were concerned with being unable to receive care and believed they needed to rely heavily on family, with extreme thoughts of death.

The structural characterization of the synthesized complexes was accomplished by NMR, FTIR, thermogravimetry (TGA), high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), electronic spectroscopic techniques coupled with density functional theory (DFT). The stability of the complexes in different pH media of solvent was studied. Chemical reactivity parameters of the newly synthesized complexes, computed using DFT, indicated greater reactivity of complex 2 over complex 1 and free ligand as indicated by its low HOMO-LUMO energy gap corresponding to 1.71 eV. Molecular docking (MD) studies were carried out in order to study the binding affinities between amino acid residues of DNA duplex (PDB ID: 1BNA) and SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 7T9K) with newly synthesized complexes. Complex 2 has shown promising antivirus behaviour with an inhibition constant value of 0.0423 micromol-1 with amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Toxicity of the complexes was predicted using ProTox-II online server. Antibacterial studies have indicated the complexes to exhibit greater efficacy than the free ligand, while the antioxidant activities have suggested them to display enhanced antioxidant behaviour as compared to reference compounds.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To determine the characteristics of effective health communication, we investigated three key features: message source, content, and audience. METHODS: Using a pre-test and two experiments, we tested how message content (emphasizing personal or social benefit), audience (individual differences), message source (scientists or state officials), and their interaction influence adherence to preventive measures. Using fliers advocating preventive measures, Experiment 1 investigated the effects of message content and examined the moderator role of individual differences. Experiment 2 presented the messages using news articles and manipulated sources. RESULTS: Study 1 found decreasing adherence over time, with no significant impact from message content or individual differences. Study 2 found messages emphasizing 'protect yourself' and 'protect your country' to increase intentions for adherence to preventive measures. It also revealed an interaction between message source and content whereby messages emphasizing personal benefit were more effective when they came from healthcare professionals than from state officials. However, message source and content did not affect vaccination intentions or donations for vaccine research.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical data of 12 children with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection-associated ANE who were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital from December 18 to 29, 2022. The children were divided into two groups based on outcomes: death group (7 cases) and survival group (5 cases). The clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The median age of the 12 patients was 30 months, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. All patients presented with persistent high fever, with a median highest body temperature of 41C. The median time from fever onset to seizure or consciousness disturbance was 18 hours. The death group had a higher proportion of neurogenic shock, coagulation dysfunction, as well as elevated lactate, D-dimer, interleukin-6, interleukin--8, and interleukin-10 levels compared to the survival group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection-associated with ANE commonly present with persistent high fever, rapidly progressing disease, and have a high likelihood of developing consciousness disorders and multiorgan dysfunction within a short period.

However, the impact of the pandemic on Canadian adolescents is relatively unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures on the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of adolescents in Alberta, Canada. METHODS: A qualitative study using an interpretive description (ID) approach and community-based participatory research principles was conducted to capture the subjective experience and perceptions of adolescents and service providers. With the collaboration of the Adolescent Advisory Group and community partners, 18 adolescents and 15 service providers were recruited for the study through purposive sampling. Findings from the qualitative interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) COVID-19 SRH experience, (2) barriers to SRH, and (3) adolescent SRH strategies. Our findings highlight numerous barriers and challenges that prevented adolescents from accessing SRH education, products, and services. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the SRH and the well-being of adolescents.

Previous studies have reported changes in smoking behavior and influencing factors during the COVID-19 period, but none of them explored the main influencing factor and high-risk populations for smoking behavior during this period. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey and obtained 21,916 valid data. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between each potential influencing factor (sociodemographic characteristics, perceived social support, depression, anxiety, and self-efficacy) and smoking outcomes. Then, variables related to smoking behavior were included based on the results of the multiple logistic regression, and the classification and regression tree (CART) method was used to determine the high-risk population for increased smoking behavior during COVID-19 and the most profound influencing factors on smoking increase. Finally, we used accuracy to evaluated the performance of the tree. RESULTS: The strongest predictor of smoking behavior during the COVID-19 period is acceptance degree of passive smoking. The subgroup with a high acceptation degree of passive smoking, have no smokers smoked around, and a length of smoking of >= 30 years is identified as the highest smoking risk (34%). The accuracy of classification and regression tree is 87%. CONCLUSION: The main influencing factor is acceptance degree of passive smoking. More knowledge about the harm of secondhand smoke should be promoted.

As these symptoms reduce the mental well-being and effectiveness of HCWs which are followed by poor health outcomes for patients, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the prevalence of OCD symptoms among HCWs worldwide. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Emerald, and ERIC databases were searched using related keywords till the end of October 2021. Observational studies about the prevalence of OCD symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic were screened and evaluated. In order to assess the quality of studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) checklist was used. The effect measure was the prevalence rate with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 7864 individuals from 11 studies were included. The range of OCD symptoms prevalence across these studies was from 0.07 to 0.47. Due to the high heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 98.6%, P < 0.01), the random effects model was used. The pooled prevalence was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.22-0.38) based on logit transformed CI. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of OCD symptoms was 29% among the HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, mapping the existing surveillance system from countries with different income and development levels is needed to learn and compare the effectiveness of surveillance. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the health system, including the healthcare services for pregnant women, neonates, infants, and children under five, as well as the recording, reporting, and surveillance system. The need to adapt to the new normal during the pandemic has stimulated innovation while incorporating new COVID-19-related indicators into the existing public health system. Therefore, this review aims to describe the existing implementation and the COVID-19 pandemic's influence on the MNCH surveillance system. METHODS: We will search published literature (from MEDLINE, Embase, and Portal Garuda), manually search from all reference lists of included studies, and conduct a targeted search of relevant gray literature. This review will include studies of surveillance systems or describe COVID-19 surveillance or routine reports involving MNCH (morbidity and mortality). The studies included will be in English or Indonesian language, observational study designs, and published or documented from 2010 to 2023. Two investigators will independently screen the title and abstract, including each full article to determine the eligibility of studies. The data will be assessed using a narrative approach. Data will be reported in simple descriptive tables. DISCUSSION: Our findings are expected to map the existing implementation of MNCH surveillance systems before and during the pandemic, including the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on MNCH surveillance across countries with different income levels. This may contribute to existing knowledge on the MNCH health surveillance system that could be integrated into the surveillance of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19.

METHODS: ACILT offered 20 Laboratory Biosafety and Infrastructure courses (2008-2014), also referred as biosafety course/course comprising of 14 core laboratory safety elements to 402 participants from 22 countries. In 2015, participants received 22 e-questions divided into four categories: (1) Safety Policies, (2) Management's Engagement, (3) Safety Programs and (4) Assessments of Safety Practices to determine retrospectively the training effectiveness of biosafety practices in their place of employment 6 months before and after attending their course. We used Kirkpatrick model to assess the transference of knowledge, skills and obstructive factors. RESULTS: 20% (81/402) of the participants completed the e-questionnaire. The overall percentage of positive responses indicating implementation of new safety practices increased from 50% to 84%. Improvement occurred in all four categories after attending the course, with the greatest increases in Safety Policies (67-94%) and Safety Programs (43-91%). Creating a safety committee, allocating resources, and establishing a facility safety policy were important drivers for implementing and maintaining laboratory safety practices. In addition, accredited laboratories and countries with national safety regulations or policies had a higher percentage of improvements. The most reported challenges were inadequate funding and lack of management enforcement. CONCLUSIONS: PEPFAR and other partners' investments in training institutions, such as ACILT, were effective in building sustainable country ownership to strengthen biosafety practices and were leveraged to combat zoonotic diseases and COVID-19. Although support continues at the national/regional level, a standardized, coordinated and continent-wide sustainable approach to offer a biosafety program-like ACILT is missing. Continuous offerings of biosafety programs similar to ACILT could contribute to sustainable strengthening of laboratory biosafety, QMS and pandemic preparedness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000163", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "AIDS", "locations": [{"offset": 432, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 561, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D015658", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "HIV", "locations": [{"offset": 599, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 964, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1005, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1468, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D015047", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "zoonotic diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 2409, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2431, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990251, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D015047", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D000163", "disease@MESH:D015658", "species@9606"], "journal": "Trop Med Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Shrivastava R", "Stevens T", "Westerman L", "Bressler D", "van Schalkwyk E", "Bressler C", "Ugwu K", "Mwangi C", "Opio JP", "Nkodyo J", "Mwangi JW", "Martin MD", "Nesby-O'Dell S"]}

Recently, there have been reports on critical patients, which are different from previous research results. The meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effects of baricitinib in COVID-19, by pooling data from all clinically randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to increase power to testify. METHODS: Studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases on January 31, 2023. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for the treatment of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. This study is registered with INPLASY, number 202310086. RESULTS: A total of 3010 patients were included in our analyses. All included studies were randomized controlled trials or prospective study. There was no difference in 14-day mortality between the two groups [OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.03-1.84), I2 = 72%, P = 0.17]. In subgroup analyses we found that baricitinib did not seem to improve significantly in 24-day mortality critically ill patients [OR 0.60 (95% CI 0.35-1.02), I2 = 0%, P = 0.06]. Fortunately, baricitinib have led to faster recovery and shorter hospital stays for COVID-19 patients. There were no difference in infections and infestations, major adverse cardiovascular events, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions. At the same time, we can find that it reduces the mortality of COVID-19 patients, not including the critically ill.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 208, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 223, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 232, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 288, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 412, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 427, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 719, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 777, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 869, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1020, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 1138, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1198, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D016638", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "critically ill", "locations": [{"offset": 1208, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1223, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 1294, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1365, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1374, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 1412, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020246", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deep vein thrombosis", "locations": [{"offset": 1478, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011655", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pulmonary embolism", "locations": [{"offset": 1503, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000596027", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Baricitinib", "locations": [{"offset": 1536, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1651, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1664, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1673, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D016638", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "critically ill", "locations": [{"offset": 1701, "length": 14}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990249, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D016638", "disease@MESH:D020246", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D011655", "species@9606", "chemical@MESH:C000596027"], "journal": "Eur J Med Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Sun J", "Wang S", "Ma X", "Wei Q", "Peng Y", "Bai Y", "Miao G", "Meng C", "Liu P"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

In response to the medical surge, countries with social insurance systems provided financial incentives to medical institutions. This study aimed to present the directions for health insurance support by comparing countries in terms of the domains and contents of COVID-19 health insurance support to ensure timely support in case of future pandemics. METHODS: An analysis framework was developed to compare health insurance policy interventions for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 domains, and detailed policy interventions were divided into sub-domains (space, staff, and stuff) for each domain. Data were collected by country from the websites of the Ministry of Health and Social Insurers, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and were analyzed using qualitative comparative analysis. RESULTS: The countries provided comprehensive support for both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 domains. In the COVID-19 domain, overall support was provided in all three sub-domains. Additional cost support was provided to prevent infection and provide secure facilities to treat confirmed patients. Outpatient services were mainly supported, and an intensive intervention was developed in the staff sub-domain for the non-COVID-19 domain. The point of policy intervention was the surge of the first confirmed case. Continuous revisions were subsequently made. The government provided financial support through health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding where policy support through health insurance should be focused, the workload of medical personnel increased according to the change in the service provision environment due to the pandemic, and the medical service delivery system changed to prevent further infection. Consequently, incentives should be provided to aid the provision of stable services to patients and should be an auxiliary means to implement the national quarantine policy more effectively via a health insurance response system that promptly provides additional financial support in case of future crises.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 166, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 514, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 700, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 717, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1175, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1192, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1217, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1337, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1396, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Outpatient", "locations": [{"offset": 1406, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1529, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2016, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2114, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"type": "Chemical", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "quarantine", "locations": [{"offset": 2182, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990238, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239"], "journal": "Arch Public Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Ko HJ", "Yun E", "Ahn B", "Lee H", "Jang WM", "Lee JY"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Recent years have witnessed a rising incidence of PCP in this vulnerable population, leading to graft loss and increased mortality. Immunosuppression, which is essential in transplant recipients, heightens susceptibility to viral and opportunistic infections, magnifying the clinical challenge. Concurrently, the global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been profound. Kidney transplant recipients have faced severe outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2, often requiring intensive care. Co-infection with COVID-19 and PCP in this context represents a complex clinical scenario that requires precise management strategies, involving a delicate balance between immunosuppression and immune activation. Although there have been case reports on management of COVID-19 and PCP in kidney transplant recipients, guidance on how to tackle these infections when they occur concurrently remains limited. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We have encountered four kidney transplant recipients with concurrent COVID-19 and PCP infection. These patients received comprehensive treatment that included adjustment of their maintenance immunosuppressive regimen, anti-pneumocystis therapy, treatment for COVID-19 and other infections, and symptomatic and supportive care. After this multifaceted treatment strategy, all of these patients improved significantly and had favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully managed four kidney transplant recipients co-infected with COVID-19 and PCP. While PCP is a known complication of immunosuppressive therapy, its incidence in patients with COVID-19 highlights the complexity of dual infections. Our findings suggest that tailored immunosuppressive regimens, coupled with antiviral and antimicrobial therapies, can lead to clinical improvement in such cases. Further research is needed to refine risk assessment and therapeutic strategies, which will ultimately enhance the care of this vulnerable population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2",

However, what is even more important is the awareness and familiarity of learners with different systems and their appropriate use in e-learning. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the satisfaction of learners with synchronous and asynchronous electronic learning systems during the COVID-19 period at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. METHODS: The present study was a descriptive-analytical study conducted cross-sectionally from the first semester of 2019-2020 academic year until the end of the second semester of 2021-2022 academic year, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample size was determined to be 370 students and 650 staff members using the Krejcie and Morgan table. The face validity and reliability of the research tool, which was a researcher-made questionnaire, was confirmed. Considering a response rate of 75%, 280 completed questionnaires were received from students, and 500 completed questionnaires were collected from employees. For data analysis, absolute and relative frequencies, as well as independent t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Post Hoc tests in the SPSS software were utilized. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, both students and staff members at Tehran University of Medical Sciences showed a relatively decreasing level of satisfaction with electronic learning. There was a significant difference in satisfaction between these two groups of learners regarding electronic learning (P = 0/031). Learners were relatively more satisfied with the offline system called \"Navid\" compared to online learning systems. Among the online systems, the highest level of satisfaction was observed with the Skype platform. CONCLUSION: Although learners expressed relative satisfaction with electronic learning during the COVID-19 period, it is necessary to strengthen infrastructure and provide support services, technical assistance, and continuous updates for electronic learning platforms. This can contribute to more effective and efficient utilization of electronic learning, especially during particular circumstances and crises, or in hybrid models combining online and face to face education and training.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 648, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 932, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1521, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2135, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990188, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D007859", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "BMC Med Educ", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Dargahi H", "Kooshkebaghi M", "Mireshghollah M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Given limited evidence in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has fuelled IPV globally, we aimed to describe and compare experiences and perpetration of IPV of youth aged 16-24 by sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). METHODS: During the study period (December 2021-May 2022), youth aged 16-24 from eThekwini district, South Africa completed an online survey to understand multilevel impacts of the pandemic on youth. Participants were asked about experiences and perpetration of physical IPV since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020). Descriptive statistics and adjusted logistic regressions compared the likelihood of experiencing and/or perpetrating physical IPV between cisgender and transgender inclusive heterosexual men; heterosexual women; gay, bisexual, or questioning men [GBQM]; lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning women [LGBQW]; or gender/sexual non-conforming youth [non-conforming]. RESULTS: Of 1,588 youth (mean age = 21.7 [SD = 2.3]; 71.7% Black) with non-missing SOGI and physical IPV data, 238 (15.0%) were LGBTQ+ (40.3% LGBQW and 36.1% non-conforming). Overall, 14.6% of respondents experienced physical IPV and 9.8% perpetrated physical IPV since the start of the pandemic, which differed by SOGI (12.3% of heterosexual men, 13.9% of heterosexual women, 22.0% of GBQM, 18.2% of LGBQW, and 25.0% of non-conforming youth experienced and 10.3% of heterosexual men; 7.7% of heterosexual women; 10.0% of GBQM; 18.2% of LGBQW; and 16.7% of non-conforming youth perpetrated). In adjusted models, compared to heterosexual women, non-conforming youth had increased odds of experiencing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.36; 95%CI, 1.26-4.39) physical IPV and compared to heterosexual men, non-conforming youth had greater odds of perpetrating physical IPV (aOR = 2.19; 95%CI, 1.07-4.48) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Over one in six youth in our study experienced and one in ten perpetrated physical IPV since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with gender and sexual non-conforming youth experiencing and perpetrating IPV at significantly greater rates than cisgender/heterosexual peers. Our findings highlight the need for gender transformative efforts that move beyond the gender binary to support healthy relationships and IPV prevention for LGBTQ + youth in South Africa and globally.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 217, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 443, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 833, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 931, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1150, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1168, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1205, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1256, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1670, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1697, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 1807, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1833, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1964, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "men", "locations": [{"offset": 2122, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2368, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990170, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "BMC Public Health", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Closson K", "Zulu B", "Jesson J", "Dietrich JJ", "Pakhomova T", "Basham CA", "Beksinska M", "Kaida A"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Two of its features draw attention: (i) it is absent in other known lineage B beta-coronaviruses, including the newly discovered coronaviruses in bats from Laos and Vietnam, which are the closest known relatives of the covid virus; and, (ii) it introduced the pair of arginine codons (CGG-CGG), whose usage is extremely rare in coronaviruses. With an occurrence rate of only 3%, the arginine CGG codon is considered a minority in SARS CoV-2. On the other hand, Laos and Vietnam bat coronaviruses contain receptor-binding domains that are almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 and can therefore infect human cells despite the absence of the furin cleavage motif. RESULTS: Based on these data, the aim of this work is to provide a detailed sequence analysis between the SARS-CoV-2 S gene insert encoding PRRA and the human mRNA transcripts. The result showed a 100% match to several mRNA transcripts. The set of human genes whose mRNAs match this S gene insert are ubiquitous and highly expressed, e.g., the ATPase F1 (ATP5F1) and the ubiquitin specific peptidase 21 (USP21) genes; or specific genes of target organs or tissues of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., MEMO1, SALL3, TRIM17, CWC15, CCDC187, FAM71E2, GAB4, PRDM13). Results suggest that a recombination between the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor and human mRNA transcripts could be the origin of the S gene 12-nucleotide insert encoding the S protein PRRA motif. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of probable human origin of the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic furin cleavage motif is supported by: (i) the nature of human genes whose mRNA sequence 100% match the S gene insert; (ii) the synonymous base substitution in the arginine codons (CGG-CGG); and (iii) further spike glycoprotein PRRA-like insertions suggesting that the acquisition of PRRA may not have been a single

In the retrospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.86), sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1.00), and PPV of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.309-0.4). In the prospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.966-0.984), sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99), and PPV of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.626-0.692). The daily median time from message receipt to crisis specialist triage ranges from 8 to 13 min, compared to 9 h before the deployment of the system. We demonstrate that a NLP-based machine learning model can reliably identify potential crisis chat messages in a telehealth setting. Our system integrates into existing clinical workflows, suggesting that with appropriate training, humans can successfully leverage ML systems to facilitate triage of crisis messages.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 111, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C059179", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NLP", "locations": [{"offset": 478, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C059179", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "NLP", "locations": [{"offset": 1342, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 1552, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990134, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "chemical@MESH:C059179"], "journal": "NPJ Digit Med", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Swaminathan A", "L&#xf3;pez I", "Mar RAG", "Heist T", "McClintock T", "Caoili K", "Grace M", "Rubashkin M", "Boggs MN", "Chen JH", "Gevaert O", "Mou D", "Nock MK"]}

METHODS: This study used a questionnaire to obtain data from pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) centers in seven tertiary hospitals in Northeast China from December 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. RESULTS: A total of 255 patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 45 patients (17.65 %) were included in this study. Of these, seven (15.6%) patients died, and the median time from admission to death was 35 h (IQR, 14-120 h). Twenty (52.6%) survivors experienced neurological sequelae. Patients with platelet counts lower than 100 x 109/L had a higher incidence of complications such as multiple organ dysfunction, mechanical ventilation rate, and mortality. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) always reveals cerebral tissue edema, with some severe lesions forming a softening site. CONCLUSION: Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 often exhibit severe neurological symptoms, and in some cases, they may rapidly develop malignant cerebral edema or herniation, leading to a fatal outcome. An early decrease in platelet count may associated with an unfavorable prognosis. IMPACT: Since early December 2022, China has gradually adjusted its prevention and control policy of SARS-CoV-2; Omicron outbreaks have occurred in some areas for a relatively short period. Due to the differences in ethnicity, endemic strains and vaccination status, there was a little difference from what has been reported about children with SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe neurological symptoms in abroad. This is the first multicenter clinical study in children with nervous system involvement after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, and helpful for pediatricians to have a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical symptoms and prognosis of such disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 182, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 203, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2", "locations": [{"offset": 245, "length": 47}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 294, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 306, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 575, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 607, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 636, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 708, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "died", "locations": [{"offset": 717, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 761, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 853, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009102", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "multiple organ dysfunction", "locations": [{"offset": 954, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1015, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004487", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "edema", "locations": [{"offset": 1098, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 1168, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 1177, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1191, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1223, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001929", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "malignant cerebral edema", "locations": [{"offset": 1290, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004677", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "herniation", "locations": [{"offset": 1318, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1541, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1771, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1785, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1818, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1899, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1957, "length": 15}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37990079, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D004677", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D009422", "disease@MESH:D009102", "disease@MESH:D001929", "species@9606", "species@2697049", "disease@MESH:D004487"], "journal": "Pediatr Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Zhang T", "Zhang QF", "Yang HM", "Liu P", "Sun P", "Li YM", "Zhang Z", "Huang YZ", "Yu XY", "Chao-Lu-Men QQ", "Su Q", "Liu CF"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

All-cause mortality were collected in 7 May 2020. The mortality risk was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 3545 patients with a median age of 63.7 years, 918 (25.9%) died within the time of cohort data collection after admission. When the CRP was < 15.6 mg/L, the mortality rate increased with an adjusted HR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.30-1.91, P < 0.0001) for every 10 mg/L increment in the CRP.

However, optimized strategies for sample preparation have been poorly investigated, and the combination of RNase inhibitors and Proteinase K has been rarely considered. Hence, we investigated combinations of several extraction-free protocols incorporating heat treatment, sample dilution, and Proteinase K and RNase inhibitors, and validated the effectiveness using 120 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 62 negative clinical samples. Combining sample dilution and heat treatment with Proteinase K and RNase inhibitors addition exhibited the highest sensitivity (84.26%) with a mean increase in cycle threshold (Ct) value of + 3.8. Meanwhile, combined sample dilution and heat treatment exhibited a sensitivity of 79.63%, accounting for a 38% increase compared to heat treatment alone. Our findings highlight that the incorporation of Proteinase K and RNase inhibitors with sample dilution and heat treatment contributed only marginally to the improvement without yielding statistically significant differences.

In this study, we collected untreated wastewater samples hourly for 4 days at two wastewater treatment plants in Wales to establish diurnal patterns in virus concentrations and the physico-chemical properties of the water. Simultaneously, we also trialled three absorbent materials as passive samples as a simple and cost-efficient alternative for the collection of composite samples. Ninety-six percent of all liquid samples (n = 74) and 88% of the passive samplers (n = 59) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, whereas 87% and 97% of the liquid and passive samples were positive for the faecal indicator virus crAssphage, respectively. We found no significant daily variations in the concentration of the target viruses, ammonium and orthophosphate, and the pH and electrical conductivity levels were also stable. Weak positive correlations were found between some physico-chemical properties and viral concentrations. More variation was observed in samples taken from the influent stream as opposed to those taken from the influent tank. Of the absorbent materials trialled as passive samples, we found that tampons provided higher viral recoveries than electronegative filter paper and cotton gauze swabs. For all materials tested, viral recovery was dependent on the virus type. Our results indicate that grab samples may provide representative alternatives to 24-h composite samples if taken from the influent tank, hence reducing the costs of sampling for WBE programmes.

Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a model evidence-based home visiting program, shown to improve pregnancy outcomes, child development, and economic self-sufficiency for first-time mothers and their families experiencing social and economic adversities, enrolling them early in pregnancy. Recently, NFP has expanded its services to multiparous women (previous live births) and enrolling women past 28 weeks gestation (late registrants) in selected agencies in Florida since 2021. OBJECTIVE: To study the process and impacts of expanding NFP to expanded populations (multiparous and/or late registrants), we convened a diverse Advisory Committee to guide the NFP expansion evaluation in Florida. METHODS: This study employed a modified e-Delphi method with three rounds of data collection, to engage diverse partners to identify process and impact outcomes for the NFP expansion evaluation. RESULTS: Child maltreatment was identified as the highest priority outcome. Process outcomes included program reach, client enrollment, and client engagement, while impact outcomes included maternal physical health, maternal mental health and substance use, birth outcomes, and breastfeeding practices. The Advisory Committee further identified potential data sources to measure these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Identifying and selecting key process and impact outcomes using a community-engaged process is necessary to ensure equal buy-in from all partners and to inform rigorous program evaluation. This study showed that using methods such as e-Delphi is feasible and effective for achieving thoughtful and rigorous decision-making, even in times of uncertainty like the COVID-19 pandemic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 225, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "child", "locations": [{"offset": 356, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 583, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 626, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Child", "locations": [{"offset": 1138, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1912, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37989933, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Matern Child Health J", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Williams VN", "Marshall J", "Richey M", "Allison M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: The Tyrolean COVID-19 Children's Study (TCCS: n = 401; June 2021 to July 2021) and the Corona and Psyche in South Tyrol 2021 Study (COP-S; n = 3402; May 2021 to June 2021) were used for data analyses. Both studies employed cross-sectional designs and collected data through online questionnaires completed by children aged 7-13 years and their parents. Various psychosocial assessment tools including the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screening, Children Anxiety Test, Child Behavior Check List, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children were used in the surveys. RESULTS: The comparison between North Tyrol and South Tyrol revealed no significant differences in perceived threats, trauma, or anxiety among children. Similarly, there were no substantial disparities in psychosomatic complaints, indicating similar manifestations of emotional distress across the two regions. CONCLUSION: The comparative analysis of children's mental health outcomes in North Tyrol and South Tyrol during the COVID-19 pandemic confirmed the analogous influence of sociocultural and contextual factors on their wellbeing. Despite presumable variations in pandemic events, management strategies, and healthcare systems, the study suggests comparable resilience among children and highlights the importance of sociocultural factors in shaping their wellbeing.

In this paper, we briefly review the history of inpatient educational conferences before offering five recommendations for improvement. Our recommendations include grounding conference formats in educational theory, leveraging the expertise of all potential educators, broadening content to include health equity and justice throughout all curricula, and explicitly focusing on cultivating community among participants. Recognizing that each residency program is different, we anticipate that these recommendations may be implemented differently based on program size, available resources, and current institutional practices. We also include examples of prior successful curricular reforms aligned with our principles.

To aid in the knowledge of in-hospital care of children with COVID-19, this study presents an expert review of the literature, including the management of respiratory distress or failure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), hemodynamic and other organ support, pharmaceutical therapies (anti-viral drugs, anti-inflammatory or antithrombotic therapies) and management of cardiopulmonary arrest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 44, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "locations": [{"offset": 111, "length": 47}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 160, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 172, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 205, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 231, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 260, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 383, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 449, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 506, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 520, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012131", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory distress or failure", "locations": [{"offset": 614, "length": 31}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 728, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006323", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiopulmonary arrest", "locations": [{"offset": 892, "length": 22}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37989708, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D012131", "disease@MESH:D007239", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D006323", "species@2697049"], "journal": "Pediatr Neonatol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Chan OW", "Lee EP", "Chou CC", "Lai SH", "Chung HT", "Lee J", "Lin JJ", "Hsieh KS", "Hsia SH"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

We hypothesized that the desertion of hospitals due to the pandemic would lead to late arrival at the emergency room and an increased mortality. In this study, we sought to measure and compare the mortality of children with sickle cell disease before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the sickle cell disease management center of Laquintinie Hospital in Douala (Cameroon). The study period was divided into two, i.e., from March 2019 to February 2020 (Pre-COVID-19) and from March 2020 to February 2021 (COVID-19). All administrative and ethical considerations were fully respected. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: Overall, 823 patients were admitted during the study period. Males represented 52.4% of the overall population, giving a sex ratio of 1.1:1. We admitted 479 patients during the pre-COVID-19 period versus 344 patients during the COVID-19 period, which is a 28.2% drop in admissions during the COVID-19 period. The mortality rate was 3.5% during the pre-COVID-19 period and 3.2% during the COVID-19 period (p>0.05). The most common causes of death were ACS (39.3%, n = 11), severe anemia (25.0%, n = 7), and VOC (17.9%, n = 5). ACS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.628, 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.645-7.005], p<0.001) was significantly associated with mortality.

METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was conducted at Tours University Hospital. All pediatric surgical emergency room visits recorded from February 10, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were included. The three aforementioned periods were assessed. RESULTS: During lockdown there were significantly more burns compared to other injuries (p = 0.004).

Motivated by measles and vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV) outbreaks in 2016-17 and low vaccination rates, the provinces of Haut Lomami and Tanganyika were identified as pilot locations for an innovative approach focused on establishing a consortium of partners supporting local government. This approach was formalized through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Provincial governments in 2018. A third province, Lualaba, established an MoU in 2021. MOU IMPLEMENTATION: These MoUs were 5-year partnerships designed to aid provinces in meeting four key objectives: 80 % immunization coverage, management/elimination of polio/cVDPV outbreaks, improvement of vaccine accessibility, and transfer of immunization service management to provincial leadership. OUTCOMES: During the MoU period, Haut-Lomami saw an increase in full immunization coverage, from 35.7 % (MICS 2018) to 88.9 % (VCS 2021-22), the highest in country. A sharp drop in percentage of zero-dose children was observed in the 3 provinces, confirming improved access to immunization services. Tanganyika saw initial improvement in full immunization coverage, followed by a drop in the VCS 2021-22 due to COVID-19 and healthcare worker strikes. Coverage improved in Tanganyika in the 2023 VCS. The 3 provinces increased their financial contributions to routine immunization and are now the top contributing provinces. While no cVDPV cases were recorded in 2020 and 2021, cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 outbreaks are afflicting the 3 provinces since 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, the provincial MoUs were successful in bolstering provincial autonomy and capacity building with the biggest success being a drop in zero-dose children.

Qualitative research with 214 adults (including pregnant women) in three Ivorian cities in November 2022 revealed that most participants knew that the COVID-19 vaccine had not been recommended for pregnant women. Some participants felt that the policy change alone would be enough to motivate pregnant women to get vaccinated, but others felt that it would be difficult to convince pregnant women that the vaccine is safe for them and their babies. Pregnant women who participated in the study expressed a preference for waiting until after giving birth to get vaccinated against COVID-19, to be safe. They viewed the COVID-19 vaccine as risky during pregnancy but seemed unaware of the heightened risks that COVID-19 illness poses to pregnant women and babies. Pregnant participants stated that if they believed that the COVID-19 vaccine was good for the baby they would put aside their fears and get vaccinated. Reframing the conversation around the dangers of COVID-19 for pregnant women and their babies and positioning the COVID-19 vaccine as safe during pregnancy and protective, both during pregnancy and afterwards, could encourage uptake among this important segment of the population. Potential strategies to reinforce perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine safety for pregnant women include frequent and consistent messaging through both interpersonal and mass media channels; leveraging prenatal consultations and the relationship between health workers and pregnant women for both counseling and vaccination; and engaging influential others to support pregnant women in the decision to accept vaccination against COVID-19. Positive testimonials may help combat rumors that the vaccine negatively affects fertility and reproductive health, which could help to foster positive attitudes towards the vaccine before a woman even becomes pregnant and encourage broad vaccination among women of reproductive age.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 174, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 319, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 383, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 450, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 477, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 532, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 544, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 628, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 717, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 784, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 906, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 944, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1035, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1070, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1097, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1148, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1289, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1311, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1354, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1570, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1607, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1798, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1893, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1945, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "woman", "locations": [{"offset": 2146, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2212, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37989611, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Vaccine", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Naugle D", "Tibbels N", "Dosso A", "Benie W", "Nana M"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

AIM: The aim of the study was to explore how patients, who frequently attended primary care practices before the pandemic, perceived primary care during the initial phase of Covid-19 in Germany. DESIGN & SETTING: Between January and June 2021, we completed 17 semi-structured interviews. Participants included primary care patients from two regions in Germany who frequently attended their physician before the start of the pandemic. METHOD: Data were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Four interconnected themes emerged in the analysis: 'fear of Covid-19 infection', 'practice organisation', 'information about Covid-19' and 'telemedicine'. Participants were unconcerned about being infected in their practice and mostly agreed with Covid-19 regulations though waiting outside for their appointment was uncomfortable for some. Participants consulted their primary care physician in relation to different vaccines but felt they were sufficiently informed regarding general information about Covid-19. Views on telemedicine, which was mostly understood as contact via telephone or video call, differed widely, with some participants being very accepting and interested, others dismissing telemedicine categorically. CONCLUSION: Participants regarded the new Covid-19 regulations as sensible. Telemedicine using telephone or video call consultations should be further explored under the assumption that this would be acceptable for some but not all patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 112, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Patients", "locations": [{"offset": 195, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 223, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 336, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 480, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 609, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 723, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 758, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 990, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 999, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1055, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1085, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 1127, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1177, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1271, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1434, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1562, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1670, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1700, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1890, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37989535, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239"], "journal": "BJGP Open", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Otto D", "Vanderwardt V"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: We used data collected between June 2021 and June 2022 by Statistics Canada's Canadian Community Health Survey, a large, nationally representative cross-sectional study. The analysis included 64 722 participants aged 18 years or older from the 10 provinces. We used a multiple logistic regression model to determine associations between vaccination status and race, controlling for collection period, region of residence, age, gender and education. RESULTS: Nonvaccination against COVID-19 was more frequent in off-reserve First Nations people (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.7) and Black people (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6), and less frequent among South Asian people (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7) compared to White people.

We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status of Ontarians with and without a history of mental illness. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of all community-dwelling Ontario residents aged 19 years and older as of Sept. 17, 2021. We used health administrative data to categorize Ontario residents with a mental disorder (anxiety, mood, substance use, psychotic or other disorder) within the previous 5 years. Vaccine receipt as of Sept. 17, 2021, was compared between individuals with and without a history of mental illness. RESULTS: Our sample included 11 900 868 adult Ontario residents. The proportion of individuals not fully vaccinated (2 doses) was higher among those with substance use disorders (37.7%) or psychotic disorders (32.6%) than among those with no mental disorders (22.9%), whereas there were similar proportions among those with anxiety disorders (23.5%), mood disorders (21.5%) and other disorders (22.1%). After adjustment for age, sex, neighbourhood income and homelessness, individuals with psychotic disorders (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.20) and substance use disorders (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.34-1.35) were more likely to be partially vaccinated or unvaccinated relative to individuals with no mental disorders. INTERPRETATION: Our study found that psychotic disorders and substance use disorders were associated with an increased prevalence of being less than fully vaccinated.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data for all patients admitted to hospital care for acute coronary syndromes in Slovenia (nationwide cohort) between 2014 and 2021 were obtained by merging the national hospital database, national medicines reimbursement database and population mortality registry using unique identifying numbers. Using interrupted time series analysis, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admission rates and quality of care (in-hospital and 30-day mortality, reperfusion and secondary preventive medication uptake). Data were fitted to segmented regression models with March 2020 as the breakpoint. Data on 21 001 patients were included (7057 ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 7649 non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 6295 unstable angina). Hospital admissions for STEMI remained stable (92 patients; +1 patient per month, p=0.783), whereas the pandemic was associated with a significant reduction in NSTEMI (81 patients; -21 patients per month, p=0.015) and unstable angina admissions (47 patients; -28 patients per month, p=0.025). In patients with STEMI, the pandemic did not affect reperfusion rates (0.29%, (95% CI) -1.5% to 2.1%, p=0.755) or in-hospital mortality (0.1%, (95% CI) -0.9% to 1.1%, p=0.815), but was associated with a significant negative trend for secondary preventive medication uptake (-0.12%, (95% CI) -0.23% to -0.01%, p=0.034). CONCLUSION: In Slovenia, hospital admissions for STEMI remained stable throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but NSTEMI and unstable angina admissions dropped significantly.

METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (in any setting) between April 2020 and June 2021 were identified in Optum Clinformatics. Two comparator cohorts were constructed: an 'AURI pandemic' cohort (AURI diagnosis between April 2020 and June 2021) and an 'AURI prepandemic' cohort (AURI diagnosis between January 2018 and December 2018). One-year incidence of AF was compared among: COVID-19 versus AURI pandemic cohort; COVID-19 versus AURI prepandemic cohort; and AURI pandemic versus AURI prepandemic cohort. For each comparison, we applied a matching weights technique to balance covariates. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of incident AF among the matched cohorts. RESULTS: When comparing the matched COVID-19 (n=102 227) cohort with the AURI pandemic (n=102 101) cohort, higher incidence of AF was observed among the COVID-19 cohort (2.2% vs 1.2%; p<0.001; OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.72 to 1.95).

Tropospheric NO2 satellite data from Sentinel-5P was used. Two novel PCA-models were developed: Weighted Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) and Rescaled Principal Component Analysis (RPCA). Model results were tested for goodness-of-fit to empirical NO2 data. The models were used to predict actual near-surface NO2 concentrations. Model-predicted NO2 concentrations were validated with NO2 data acquired at ground monitoring stations. Besides, meteorological bias affecting NO2 was assessed. It was found that the weather component had substantial impact on NO2 built-ups, propitiating air pollutant decrease during lockdown and increase after. WPCA and RPCA models well fitted to observed NO2. Both models accurately estimated near-surface NO2 concentrations. Modeled NO2 variation results evidenced the prolongated effect of the total lockdown (up to half a year). Model-predicted NO2 concentrations were found to highly correlate with monitoring station NO2 data collected on the ground. It is concluded that PCA is reliable in identifying and predicting air pollution variation patterns.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: 414 eye care professional centres from Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Refractive data from 59 926 German children aged 6-15 years were examined over a 7-year period (2015-2021). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Spherical equivalent refraction was assessed as a function of year, age and gender. The refractive values concerning 2020 and 2021 were compared with those assigned to prior years (2015-2019). RESULTS: The refractive data associated with 2020 and 2021 showed a myopic refractive shift of approximately -0.20D compared with the 2015-2019 range. The refractive change was statistically considerable in the 6 to 11-year range (p<0.05), while from 12 to 15 years was negligible (p>=0.10). Percentage of myopes was also impacted in 2021 (p=0.002), but not in 2020 (p=0.25). From 6 to 11 years, the percentage of myopes in 2021 increased significantly by 6.02% compared with the 2015-2019 range (p<=0.04). The highest percentage increase occurred at 8 and 10 years of age, showing a rise of 7.42% (p=0.002) and 6.62% (p=0.005), respectively. From 12 to 15 years, there was no significant increase in the percentage of myopes in 2021 (p>=0.09). Percentage of myopes in 2020 was not influenced at any age (p>=0.06). CONCLUSION: Disruption of normal lifestyle due to pandemic-related home confinement appears to lead to a myopic refractive shift in children aged 6-11 years in Germany.

Our aim was to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with HCC in the West of Scotland. DESIGN: This was a retrospective audit of a prospectively collated database of patients presented to the West of Scotland Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) between April and October 2020 (during the pandemic), comparing baseline demographics, characteristics of disease at presentation, diagnostic workup, treatment and outcomes with patients from April to October 2019 (pre pandemic). RESULTS: There was a 36.5% reduction in new cases referred to the MDT during the pandemic. Patients presented at a significantly later Barcelona Cancer Liver Clinic stage (24% stage D during the pandemic, 9.5% pre pandemic, p<0.001) and with a significantly higher Child-Pugh Score (46% Child-Pugh B/C during the pandemic vs 27% pre pandemic, p<0.001).

CONCLUSION: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have contributed to a reduction in the presentation of new cases and survival among patients with HCC in the West of Scotland.

In this approximation, the only epidemiological parameter entering the estimator is R0.

For the empirical COVID-19 data, we compare different degree distributions and perform a sensitivity analysis.

However, no study so far has shown whether SARS-CoV-2 can train innate immune cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this virus can induce trained immunity in human monocytes. Methods Monocytes were exposed to inactivated (i)SARS-CoV-2 for 24 hours, followed by a resting period in medium only and a secondary stimulation on day 6 after which, the cytokine/chemokine and transcriptomic profiles were determined. Results Compared to untrained cells, the iSARS-CoV-2-trained monocytes secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL10, CXCL9 and CXCL11 upon restimulation. Transcriptome analysis of iSARS-CoV-2 trained monocytes revealed increased expression of several inflammatory genes. As epigenetic and metabolic modifications are hallmarks of trained immunity, we analyzed the expression of genes related to these processes. Findings indicate that indeed SARS-CoV-2-trained monocytes show changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, amino acid metabolism and the expression of several epigenetic regulator genes. Using epigenetic inhibitors that block histone methyl and acetyl transferases, we observed that the capacity of monocytes to be trained by iSARS-CoV-2 was abolished. Conclusion Overall, our findings indicate that iSARS-CoV-2 can induce properties associated with trained immunity in human monocytes. These results contribute to the knowledge required for improving vaccination strategies to prevent infectious diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 197, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 206, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 302, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 435, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 501, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "943", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "949"}, "text": "cytokine", "locations": [{"offset": 624, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 735, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "3569", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "502"}, "text": "IL-6", "locations": [{"offset": 799, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "7124", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "496"}, "text": "TNF-alpha", "locations": [{"offset": 805, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "3627", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1203"}, "text": "CXCL10", "locations": [{"offset": 816, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "4283", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1813"}, "text": "CXCL9", "locations": [{"offset": 824, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "6373", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "3944"}, "text": "CXCL11", "locations": [{"offset": 834, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 893, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1149, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014233", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "tricarboxylic acid", "locations": [{"offset": 1263, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000589078", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "TCA", "locations": [{"offset": 1283, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C031105", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "methyl", "locations": [{"offset": 1422, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C011632", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "acetyl", "locations": [{"offset": 1433, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1520, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1594, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1658, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003141", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infectious diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 1774, "length": 19}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37989107, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["gene@4283", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003141", "chemical@MESH:C031105", "gene@7124", "disease@MESH:D007239", "gene@943", "gene@6373", "gene@3627", "chemical@MESH:D014233", "gene@3569", "chemical@MESH:C000589078", "chemical@MESH:C011632", "species@9606", "species@2697049"], "journal": "J Innate Immun", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Cvetkovic J", "Jacobi RHJ", "Miranda-Bedate A", "Pham N", "Kutmon M", "Groot J", "van de Garde MDB", "Pinelli E"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Due to the variation in disease presentation, scientists determined that people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus were at higher risk of mortality. However, people living with type 1 diabetes have not been thoroughly studied, especially in extreme regions of developing countries. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions on different variables in a cohort with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This cohort-type study included pediatric and adult patients with type 1 diabetes at Regional Hospital Dr. Juan Noe Crevani in Arica, Chile. Biosocial and anthropometric factors, clinical history, self-care activities, and biochemical parameters were assessed and compared using analysis of variance and paired t tests between March 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were assessed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Arica, Chile. One year after the pandemic struck, the main causes for metabolic deterioration were a reduction of carbohydrate counting by an average of 8.67% (P = 0.000), a reduction of adherence to treatment by an average of 25% (P = 0.000), and a shift to telemedicine as a main health care service (P = 0.023); these factors raised hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by 1.81%, 1.78% and 0.075%, respectively. The participants' average body mass index (BMI) increased by 1.26 kg/m2 and HbA1c levels increased by 0.16% during the first year of the pandemic. Also, hospitalizations increased about 2% (P = 0.984), and there was a significant increase in carbohydrate and snack intake (P = 0.330 and P = 0.811, respectively). Children's linear growth decreased by a standard deviation of 0.035 (P = 0.648), and their physical activity decreased by 12.67% (P = 0.383). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that adherence to diabetes care was reduced during the pandemic owing to a variety of behavioral reasons and environmental changes (e.g., quarantines and food security).

This ability is important for medical students in studying anatomy as this subject requires the understanding of positional relations between organs. OBJECTIVES: To find the effect of video learning of anatomy, training, gender, and type of practical exam on mental rotation ability. Also, to find correlation between mental rotation and anatomy scores. METHODS: Two groups were recruited: group A studied practical anatomy online using videos due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown; group B studied anatomy labs on-campus on plastic models. Both groups underwent a mental rotation test. Group A took labs on-campus during their second year and this was considered a training course for their mental rotation ability. Both groups, then, took a second mental rotation test. Group A was finally given a practical anatomy exam using plastic models. RESULTS: Males scored higher than females, though not significantly. The intervention course produced no significant change in mental rotation score of group A. Mental rotation score was correlated more with the theoretical anatomy exams than the MCQ-based practical exam, for both groups. For group A, mental rotation was better correlated with the model-based than the MCQ-based practical exam, especially the post-training score.

However, CMC is understudied in individuals with SM, while, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of CMC for education and social purposes only increased. METHODS: In this study, we explored CMC in 79 adolescents with either selective mutism (n = 34), or typical development (n = 45). All participants completed a survey concerning verbal and written CMC in three contexts (friends, family, and school). RESULTS: Results showed that adolescents with SM used not only verbal but also written CMC less frequently than the comparison group across contexts. While the comparison group preferred Face-to-Face communication over CMC, adolescents with SM were divided, especially in the school context. With family and friends, the majority of the SM group preferred Face-to-Face communication, even though this provoked more feelings of tension than CMC for part of the group. CONCLUSION: These findings support anecdotal reports that SM affects not only speech but extends to other communicative venues and includes written communication in many situations. This underlines the importance of addressing not just speaking behavior but also writing and CMC in the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plans for adolescents with SM.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "0", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety disorder", "locations": [{"offset": 157, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 480, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 705, "length": 12}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988827, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D001007"], "journal": "J Commun Disord", "year": 2023, "authors": ["de Jonge MV", "Nibbering N", "Brand I", "van der Voort A"]}

BACKGROUND: Moral distress experienced in nursing education and practice manifests physically and psychologically, leads to workforce burnout and attrition, and compounds the nursing shortage. The transition to practice period is a vulnerable time for student nurses emerging into professional practice. Nurse educators serve a crucial role in the preparation of nurses for the recognition and management of moral distress in their professional nursing practice. A better understanding of the state of the science pertaining to the reports of moral distress in early career nurses is essential. DESIGN: Whittemore and Knafl's Integrative Review method and the PRISMA 2020 Checklist were utilized in this integrative review. METHODS: Five literature databases (CINAHL, ERIC, PsychInfo, PubMed, and Embase) were searched using 'moral distress' and 'new graduate nurses' as keywords. Studies were included for English language; qualitative and quantitative research; moral distress focus; years of nursing practice experience collected and analyzed in results or discussion; and all areas of clinical nursing practice, geographic locations, and nursing education levels. Studies were excluded for non-peer reviewed publications; moral distress in the academic setting; and the absence of analysis of years of nursing practice experience in the results or discussion. RESULTS: Eight primary research reports, published between 2016 and 2022 met eligibility criteria. Research methods were largely quantitative with six countries geographically represented. Acute care healthcare settings had the greatest representation with considerations for the COVID-19 pandemic in two reports. Various formats of four moral distress research instruments were used. Years of nursing practice experience were collected as a mean or category. Inconsistent reports of moral distress in early career nurses were found based on experience, age, or nursing education level. CONCLUSIONS: Research of moral distress prevalence in early career nurses was an identified literature gap. Varied reports of moral distress in early career nurses indicate a need to further understand this topic contextual to academic and clinical education. Nurse educators can prepare students for experiences of moral distress in their professional nursing practice by implementing teaching strategies that draw upon their diverse backgrounds and experiences. A research and education emphasis on moral distress in early career nurses can promote their transition to practice, support their career progression, and uphold nursing occupational commitment.

The extensive use of molecular methods during the COVID-19 pandemic has enabled massive data acquisition on viral lower respiratory tract infections. The current study aims to identify clinical features associated with eight viral agents among children presenting severe LRTI. METHODS: retrospective cohort study of data from the Brazilian Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System. Patients under 20 years-old who had severe LRTI with etiological confirmation through RT-PCR between 2020 and 2022 were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine associations between pathogens and symptoms. RESULTS: 60,657 cases were assessed. The main viral agents detected were Sars-CoV-2 (COV2) (41.2%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (29.1%), Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (12.1%), and Influenza (FLU) (5.5%). A general mortality rate of 4.3% was observed. The multivariate analysis evidenced that COV2 less likely presented with cough (OR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.32-0.36), respiratory discomfort (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 0.61; 95%Confidence Interval (CI): 0.59-0.64), and desaturation (aOR: 0.71; 95%CI: 0.69-0.75).

The impact on head and neck cancer care in populations at risk has yet to be elucidated. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate how the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer patients at a county hospital were affected by the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that were diagnosed at a county hospital 365 days before and after stay-at-home orders were initiated. The primary outcomes were duration between diagnosis from imaging and initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes included mortality, stage, nodal status, and distant metastasis at presentation. RESULTS: There was a total of 105 diagnoses. Sixty-five (62 %) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma diagnoses were diagnosed before the stay-at-home orders were initiated, and 40 (38 %) after. Eighty percent (32/40) of diagnoses presenting after had stage IV disease compared to 58 % (38/65) in those before (p < 0.05). A higher percentage of patients who presented later had a >30-day delay to biopsy (43 % v. 20 %, OR: 3.0, p < 0.05). This difference was exacerbated by those with laryngeal, oral cavity, or oropharyngeal cancer (45 % v. 15 %, OR: 4.5, p < 0.05). There was a larger delay from diagnosis to treatment after the orders were initiated (68 v. 53, p < 0.05) however there was no difference in one-year mortality (25 % v. 23 %, p > 0.05). This investigation found a 14 % loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma diagnoses at a county hospital, those diagnosed after the stay-at-home orders were initiated presented with more advanced disease. They also had more delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

SAMPLE: 706 hospital staff injuries. METHODS: Deidentified injury reports were submitted to Human Resources from 2008 through 2022. Injury data collected included the injury description, date of injury, occupation, and worker's compensation claim information. Data were summarized by year, cause of injury, total cost associated with injury, and occupation. RESULTS: There was an increase in injuries reported in recent years when compared to past years, with the plurality of injuries being bite injuries, specifically occurring on the hand, finger, and wrist area. Bite injuries had a higher average total worker's compensation cost paid to staff than striking injuries. There were more injuries reported by staff who had less experience working with animals. More injuries occurred during the summer months (June through September). There was not an unusual trend in the reporting of injuries due to COVID-19. Other injuries (eg, needlesticks and falls) were reported from only 2019 to 2022, but constituted a substantial burden for staff. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings can help stakeholders at teaching hospitals and veterinary clinics to take steps toward creating a safer workplace environment for employees. It is important to identify work hazards and provide proper training and prevention methods to reduce the risk of injuries, especially among less experienced employees. Proper prevention methods will help reduce worker's compensation costs for the teaching hospital and reduce the number of workdays missed by staff.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Human", "locations": [{"offset": 306, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1117, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988761, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D060051"], "journal": "J Am Vet Med Assoc", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Voss DS", "Boyd MV", "Evanson JF", "Bender JB"]}

Through our macro-scale analysis, we seek to better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected mortality among PWDH. METHODS: We obtained mortality and population data for the years 2018-2020 from the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) for the U.S. PWDH population, and from publicly available data for the general population. We computed mortality rates and excess mortality for both the general and PWDH populations. Stratifications by age, race/ethnicity, and sex were considered. For each group, we determined whether the 2020 mortality rates and mortality risk ratio showed a statistically significant change from 2018-2019. RESULTS: Approximately 1550 excess deaths occurred among PWDH in 2020, with Black, Hispanic/Latino and PWDH 55 and older comprising the majority of excess deaths. Mortality rates increased in 2020 from 2018-2019 across the general population in all groups. Among PWDH, mortality rates either increased, or showed no statistically significant change. These increases were similar to, or smaller than, those observed in the general population, resulting in a 7.7% decrease in the mortality risk ratio between PWDH and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: While mortality rates among PWDH increased in 2020 relative to 2018-2019, the increases were smaller, or of similar magnitude, to those observed in the general population. We thus do not find evidence of elevated mortality risk from the COVID-19 pandemic among PWDH.

However, these associations were only significant in the pre-Omicron period. We found an opposite behavior after Omicron spread, with the O phenotype having a higher probability of infection. When stratified by variant, A antigen appeared to protect against Omicron infection, whereas it was associated with an increased risk of infection by earlier variants. We were able to stratify for the SARS CoV-2 dominant variant, which revealed a causal association between blood group and probability of infection, as evidenced by the strong effect modification observed between the pre- and post-Omicron spread. The mechanism by which group A acts on the probability of infection should consider this strong effect modification.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 352, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 795, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 958, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1115, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1326, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1411, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1474, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1538, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1642, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1809, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988390, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "species@2697049"], "journal": "PLoS One", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Marraccini C", "Merolle L", "Schiroli D", "Razzoli A", "Gavioli G", "Iotti B", "Baricchi R", "Ottone M", "Mancuso P", "Giorgi Rossi P"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The experience of food insecurity in adolescents is influenced by several environmental factors at different levels (interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal), although they are not usually addressed in the design of interventions, prioritizing the individual behavioural factors. We present a scoping review protocol for assessing and identifying the environmental factors that could influence adolescents' food insecurity.

The objectives of this study are to conduct an exploratory analysis into loneliness before and during the pandemic, and determine which self-reported factors are associated with loneliness. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Participants from The Children with Long COVID (CLoCk) national study were invited to take part via an online survey, with a total of 31,017 participants taking part, 31,016 of which reported on their experience of loneliness. Participants retrospectively answered questions on demographics, lifestyle, physical health and mental health and loneliness before the pandemic and at the time of answering the survey. Before the pandemic 6.5% (2,006/31,016) of participants reported experiencing loneliness \"Often/Always\" and at the time of survey completion 17.4% (5,395/31,016) reported feeling lonelier. There was an association between meeting the research definition of long COVID and loneliness [3.49 OR, 95%CI 3.28-3.72]. CYP who reported feeling lonelier at the time of the survey than before the pandemic were assigned female at birth, older CYP, those from Black/African/Caribbean/Black British or other ethnicity groups, those that had 3-4 siblings and lived in more deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate associations between multiple factors and experiences of loneliness during the pandemic. There is a need for a multi-faceted integrated approach when developing interventions targeted at loneliness. It is important to follow up the CYP involved at regular intervals to investigate the progression of their experience of loneliness over time.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 153, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 171, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 190, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 610, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 632, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 651, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 751, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 837, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1066, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1285, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988366, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "PLoS One", "year": 2023, "authors": ["McOwat K", "Pinto Pereira SM", "Nugawela MD", "Ladhani SN", "Newlands F", "Stephenson T", "Simmons R", "Semple MG", "Segal T", "Buszewicz M", "Heyman I", "Chalder T", "Ford T", "Dalrymple E", "Consortium", "Shafran R"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

In addition, this study proposes new epidemiological metrics to describe the connectivity between observed positivity; an analogous metric to the R number in conventional epidemiology. The proposed indices, Rspatial, Rspatiotemporal and Rscaling will aim to improve the characterisation of the spread of infectious disease beyond that of the COVID-19 framework and as a result inform relevant public health policy. Apart from demonstrating the application of the novel epidemiological indices, the key findings in this study are: firstly, there were some Intermediate Zones in Edinburgh with noticeably high levels of COVID-19 positivity, and that the first outbreak during the study period was observed in Dalry and Fountainbridge. Secondly, the estimation of the distance over which the COVID-19 counts at the halls of residence are spatially correlated (or related to each other) was found to be 0.19km (0.13km to 0.27km) and is denoted by the index, Rspatial. This estimate is useful for public health policy in this setting, especially with contact tracing. Thirdly, the study indicates that the association between the surrounding community level of COVID-19 positivity (Intermediate Zones in Edinburgh) and that of the University of Edinburgh's halls of residence was not statistically significant. Fourthly, this study reveals that relatively high levels of COVID-19 positivity were observed for halls for which higher COVID-19 fines were issued (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.34), and separately, for halls which were non-ensuite relatively to those which were not (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.16).

Furthermore, by introducing a linker fragment - harboring all heterologous sequences - viral RNA can directly serve as a template for manipulating and rescuing recombinant mutant virus, without any cloning step. Overall, this strategy will facilitate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rescue and accelerate its manipulation.

Specifically, we show that, although nAb responses to the original, infecting strain of SARS-CoV-2 were not associated with Long COVID in cross-sectional analyses, cross-neutralization ID50 levels to the Omicron BA.5 variant approximately 4 months following acute infection was independently and significantly associated with greater odds of Long COVID and with persistent gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Longitudinal modeling demonstrated significant associations in the overall levels and rates of decay of neutralization capacity with Long COVID phenotypes. A higher proportion of participants had antibodies capable of neutralizing Omicron BA.5 compared with BA.1 or XBB.1.5 variants. Our findings suggest that relationships between various immune responses and Long COVID are likely complex but may involve the breadth of antibody neutralization responses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 199, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 265, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 554, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 585, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 598, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 620, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 668, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D051271", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 914, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 946, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1014, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D051271", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1074, "length": 14}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1178, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1219, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1354, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1437, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009422", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurological symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 1484, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1645, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1686, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID", "locations": [{"offset": 1873, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988251, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D009422", "species@9606", "species@2697049", "disease@MESH:D051271"], "journal": "J Med Virol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Buck AM", "Deitchman AN", "Takahashi S", "Lu S", "Goldberg SA", "Bodansky A", "Kung A", "Hoh R", "Williams MC", "Kerbleski M", "Maison DP", "Deveau TM", "Munter SE", "Lombardo J", "Wrin T", "Petropoulos CJ", "Durstenfeld MS", "Hsue PY", "Kelly JD", "Greenhouse B", "Martin JN", "Deeks SG", "Peluso MJ", "Henrich TJ"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Large-scale pandemics such as COVID-19, causing further instability in countries' financial well-being, can initiate or alter emigration flow from different countries. In light of such a complex confluence of factors, climate change, and demographic shifts in migrant communities, it is high time to shift toward machine learning-reinforced generalized approaches from the traditional parametric approaches based on migrant community-specific localized surveys. To our best knowledge, no literature has explored the nonparametric approach and developed a comprehensive database independent of localized surveys to analyze unauthorized migration. This article fills this gap by deploying nine nonparametric machine learning algorithms for predicting unauthorized immigration flow considering the dynamic border security nexus. This framework considers the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model as the null model.

Empirical evidence demonstrated that older people are the most impacted and are at higher risk of mortality after being infected. Regularly testing care facility residents is a practical approach to detecting infections proactively. In many cases, the care staff must perform the tests on the residents while also providing essential care, which in turn causes imbalances in their working time. Once an outbreak occurs, suppressing the spread of the virus in retirement homes (RHs) is challenging because the residents are in contact with each other, and isolation measures cannot be widely enforced. Regular testing strategies, on the other hand, have been shown to effectively prevent outbreaks in RHs. However, high-frequency testing may consume substantial staff working time, which results in a trade-off between the time invested in testing and the time spent providing essential care to residents. OBJECTIVE: We developed a web application (Retirement Home Testing Optimizer) to assist RH managers in identifying effective testing schedules for residents. The outcome of the app, called the \"testing strategy,\" is based on dividing facility residents into groups and then testing no more than 1 group per day. METHODS: We created the web application by incorporating influential factors such as the number of residents and staff, the average rate of contacts, the amount of time spent to test, and constraints on the test interval and size of groups. We developed mixed integer nonlinear programming models for balancing staff workload in long-term care facilities while minimizing the expected detection time of a probable infection inside the facility. Additionally, by leveraging symmetries in the problem, we proposed a fast and efficient local search method to find the optimal solution. RESULTS: Considering the number of residents and staff and other practical constraints of the facilities, the proposed application computes the optimal trade-off testing strategy and suggests the corresponding grouping and testing schedule for residents. The current version of the application is deployed on the server of the Where2Test project and is accessible on their website. The application is open source, and all contents are offered in English and German. We provide comprehensive instructions and guidelines for easy use and understanding of the application's functionalities. The application was launched in July 2022, and it is currently being tested in RHs in Saxony, Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended testing strategies by our application are tailored to each RH and the goals set by the managers. We advise the users of the application that the proposed model and approach focus on the expected scenarios, that is, the expected risk of infection, and they do not guarantee the avoidance of worst-case scenarios.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 159, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 221, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 276, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 298, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 387, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1809, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2930, "length": 9}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988136, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D007239"], "journal": "JMIR Form Res", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Davoodi M", "Batista A", "Mertel A", "Senapati A", "Abdussalam W", "Vyskocil J", "Barbieri G", "Fan K", "Schlechte-Welnicz W", "M Calabrese J"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

We examined the prevalence of drug use in this population, based both on self-reporting and on hair test results, with a focus on the detection of underreported use. METHODS: Adults entering nightclubs and festivals in New York City were asked about past-year drug use in 2019-2022 (n = 1,953), with 328 providing an analyzable hair sample for testing. We compared trends in self-reported drug use, drug positivity, and \"corrected\" prevalence, adjusting for unreported use, and delineated correlates of testing positive for ketamine and cocaine after not reporting use (discordant reporting). RESULTS: Of the 328 who provided a sample, cocaine and ketamine were the most frequently detected drugs (55.2% [n = 181] and 37.2% [n = 122], respectively), but these were also the two most underreported drugs, with 37.1% (n = 65) and 26.4% (n = 65), respectively, testing positive after not reporting use. Between 2019 and 2022, positivity decreased for cocaine, ketamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-metamfetamine, and amfetamine, and underreported exposure to cocaine and ketamine also decreased (P < 0.05). Underreporting of the use of these drugs was common, but we also detected underreported exposure to ethylone, fentanyl, 3,4-methylenedioxyamfetamine, metamfetamine, and synthetic cannabinoids. Prevalence of discordant reporting of cocaine use was higher among those testing positive for ketamine exposure (adjusted prevalence ratio = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.48-4.69) and prevalence of discordant reporting of ketamine use was lower post-coronavirus disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16-0.91) and among those reporting cocaine use (adjusted prevalence ratio = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32-0.89). DISCUSSION: Underreporting of drug use was common, suggesting the need for researchers to better deduce intentional underreporting versus unknown drug exposure via adulterants.

This paper examines the overrepresentation of female COVID-19 deaths in Canada, with an immigration lens. Data and methods: Data were extracted from the COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker to compare the sex distribution of COVID-19 deaths in Canada with that of other countries. A linkage of deaths to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB) allows for the comparison of sex-specific COVID-19 death rates by immigrant status for age and geography, as well as by major employment sector among immigrants, using the tax data from the IMDB. Results: While there were proportionately more female than male COVID-19 deaths in Canada in the early months of the pandemic, this trend was mainly a phenomenon among non-immigrants aged 85 and older. In addition, COVID-19-specific death rates for males were higher than those for females across age groups by immigrant status, except for those aged 85 and older among the non-immigrant population. Among immigrants, the death rate among health care and social assistance workers was higher among males than among females (10.7 vs. 2.9 per 100,000 population). The initially observed overrepresentation of female COVID-19 deaths to male COVID-19 deaths in Canada evened out in the summer of 2021. Interpretation: The higher proportion of female COVID-19 deaths was likely related to the high concentration of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities, where a lower institutionalization rate for immigrants had been observed. Since the implementation of vaccination targeting long-term care facility residents in Canada, the overrepresentation of female COVID-19 deaths ceased.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 155, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 218, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 227, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 279, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 288, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 349, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 358, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 449, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 524, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 533, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 593, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 690, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 699, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 908, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 917, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1059, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 1077, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 1266, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1458, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1467, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1482, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1491, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1590, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1599, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19 deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1654, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1902, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 1911, "length": 6}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37988110, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D003643"], "journal": "Health Rep", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Ng E"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Partisan differences also showed up at the state level; Trump's vote share in 2016 was negatively associated with mask use and positively associated with COVID-19 infections.

About three in ten Republicans say that the pandemic decreased their trust in their personal doctors. Nonetheless, most Americans report confidence in physicians. We replicate the findings of Gerber et al.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the total cost of development of COVID Kavach IgG ELISA and estimate the unit cost (UC) as well. METHODS: The total development cost (TDC) of COVID Kavach and its UC during the early phase of pandemic mitigation were estimated through a micro-costing approach from provider's perspective. An activity-based bottom-up costing approach was used to facilitate data collection from all resources, and analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel version 2016. The micro-costing data were utilized to interpret the breakdown of cost across all inputs and different levels of activity. RESULTS: The TDC of COVID Kavach was estimated to be $ 2,884,032 (US$ 38,265). The UC of providing test results for exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was estimated to be $ 300 (US$ 4) during July 2020. The capital and recurrent cost were incurred around 5-10 per cent and 90-95 per cent, respectively, in both the development and UC of COVID Kavach. The major portion of funds (70-80%) was utilized for procurement of laboratory consumables, followed by human resources (8-12%) in the development as well as for UC of COVID Kavach. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSIONS: The estimates from this study can be useful for conducting economic evaluations, which will help in deciding upon the subsidy in government health facilities.

METHODS: This study was conducted through participation of 47 tertiary care hospitals across India. Cases were apparently healthy individuals aged 18-45 years without any known co-morbidity, who suddenly (<24 h of hospitalization or seen apparently healthy 24 h before death) died of unexplained causes during 1st October 2021-31st March 2023. Four controls were included per case matched for age, gender and neighborhood. We interviewed/perused records to collect data on COVID-19 vaccination/infection and post-COVID-19 conditions, family history of sudden death, smoking, recreational drug use, alcohol frequency and binge drinking and vigorous-intensity physical activity two days before death/interviews. We developed regression models considering COVID-19 vaccination <=42 days before outcome, any vaccine received anytime and vaccine doses to compute an adjusted matched odds ratio (aOR) with 95 per cent confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty nine cases and 2916 controls were included in the analysis. Receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine lowered the odds [aOR (95% CI)] for unexplained sudden death [0.58 (0.37, 0.92)], whereas past COVID-19 hospitalization [3.8 (1.36, 10.61)], family history of sudden death [2.53 (1.52, 4.21)], binge drinking 48 h before death/interview [5.29 (2.57, 10.89)], use of recreational drug/substance [2.92 (1.1, 7.71)] and performing vigorous-intensity physical activity 48 h before death/interview [3.7 (1.36, 10.05)] were positively associated. Two doses lowered the odds of unexplained sudden death [0.51 (0.28, 0.91)], whereas single dose did not. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination did not increase the risk of unexplained sudden death among young adults in India.

Use of Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines was essential to the development of this effort. AIM: The aim of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate an adult ECMO program. METHODS: A logic model was used in designing and evaluating the adult ECMO program. A 35-hour ECMO specialist training course was developed, and training began in August 2020, a month before implementation of the project began. Patient outcomes were measured between September 2020 and December 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to measure the clinical outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Seventeen newly trained ECMO specialists included experienced critical care nurses and respiratory therapists. Protocols were developed for the initiation of ECMO, and tracked patient outcomes included survival off ECMO, survival to discharge, major and minor complications, and length of stay. Nine patients had COVID-19 and demonstrated an 11.11% mortality rate after adult ECMO program implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ELSO professional guidelines to design and develop this project led to the achievement of a sustainable ECMO program.

Co-financing-a donor-government agreement to jointly fund aspects of a programme, with transition towards the government assuming increasing responsibility for total cost-can be a powerful tool to help build national ownership, fiscal sustainability and programme visibility. Using Gavi's successful co-financing model as reference, the current paper draws out a set of key considerations for developing policies on co-financing of FP commodities in resource-poor settings. Macroeconomic and contextual sensitivities must be incorporated while classifying countries and determining co-financing obligations-using the actual GNI per capita on a scale or sovereign credit ratings, in conjunction with programmatic indicators, may be preferred. It is also important for policies to allow sufficiently long time for countries to transition-dependent on the country context, may be up to 10 years as allowed under the US Agency for International Development FP graduation policy and flexibility to revisit the terms following externalities that can influence the fiscal space for health. Incentivizing new domestic financing to pay for co-financing dues is critical, so as not to displace government funding from related health or social sector programs. Pragmatic ways to ensure country compliance can include engaging both the ministries of health and finance as co-signatories to identify and address known administrative and fiscal challenges; establishing dedicated co-financing account with the finance ministry; and instituting a mutual monitoring mechanism.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the subjective perceptions of family caregiving's impact on physical health and emotional well-being, the experience of feeling overburdened by caregiving responsibilities, and the subjective perceptions of health among caregivers of older relatives. Data from three waves of online questionnaire surveys conducted in 2018, 2020, and 2022 were analyzed. METHOD: The COPE Index items were used to measure subjective perceptions of the impact of caregiving on physical health and emotional well-being and perceptions of being overburdened by caregiving. We present descriptive statistics and chi-square test analyses. RESULTS: In all three waves, the majority of respondents frequently or always perceived a negative impact of caregiving on their emotional well-being and physical health, with more than half always or often experiencing caregiver overburdening. A significant correlation was observed between the perceived impact of caregiving on physical health and emotional well-being, over 70% of respondents provided similar responses to both questions. Furthermore, a significant relationship is between the prevalence of caregiver overburden and subjective perceptions of health, with those experiencing caregiver overload being more likely to report poor or very poor health. Over 60% of participants indicated frequent or constant overburden of care, with this subgroup exhibiting a higher likelihood of perceiving their health as poor or very poor. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that the caregiving burden affects both physical and emotional well-being. A significant proportion of family caregivers experience detrimental effects on their physical health and emotional well-being due to caregiving responsibilities. These negative effects were reported simultaneously by the majority of respondents. CONCLUSION: Caregiving can have negative consequences on the health of family caregivers.

OBJECTIVE: Monitoring changes in inflammatory biomarkers may offer insights into the extent of pulmonary alterations observed in chest-CT. This study aimed to evaluate the profile of different inflammatory biomarkers, widely available and routinely measured in COVID-19 patients, and to determine whether alterations in their activity at admission and discharge correlate with lung involvement assessed through CT scans. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study, wherein chest-CT scans were performed upon admission, and blood tests were conducted at admission and discharge. Treatment and monitoring adhered to national and international guidelines. RESULTS: The profile of serum inflammatory markers (including values at admission and discharge, as well as their evolution during hospitalization) demonstrated a correlation with lung involvement as assessed by the total severity score. The high activity of serum inflammatory markers upon admission, accompanied by minimal changes during hospitalization, indicated a severe form of COVID-19 with notable lung involvement. While statistically significant differences were observed in C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein emerged as the most reliable marker for assessing pulmonary involvement. CONCLUSION: Changes in serum inflammatory markers during hospitalization exhibited a weak to moderate negative correlation with the severity of lung involvement.

Slightly more than half (58.6%) of parents did not seem to worry about a possible increase in domestic accidents during the quarantine. It was observed that those who had one or two children took more protective measures than those with more than two children. Older parents seemed to explain to their children how to access emergency services more often.

METHODS: Data from the Philippine CORONA study were analyzed to determine the association of COPD and COVID-19 in terms of mortality, disease severity, respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. RESULTS: A total of 10,881 patients were included in this study, and 156 (1.4%) patients had been diagnosed with COPD. A majority of COVID-19 patients with COPD had other existing comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac disease, and chronic kidney disease. COPD patients were 2.0x more likely to present with severe to critical COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 patients with COPD in our study have a 1.7x increased mortality, 1.6x increased respiratory failure, and 2.0x increased risk for ICU admission. Smokers with COVID-19 were 1.8x more likely to present with more severe disease and have a 1.9x increased mortality.

The current scientometric study analyzes publication characteristics of articles related to male reproduction and COVID-19 infection. We used the Scopus database to analyze scientometric data (the number of publications, journals, countries, type of documents, and subject area) related to COVID-19 and male reproductive research. Our literature search identified 345 articles related to COVID-19 and male reproductive research. Most of the articles were published in the USA (n = 72), Italy (n = 55), and China (n = 51). Such research was mainly focused around medicine (57.1%), followed by biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology (25.7%). Also, in the area of male reproduction, only 37.1% (n = 128) of the articles contributed towards original research, whereas 52.8% (n = 182) were review articles and editorials focusing more on sexual dysfunction than infertility.

This study learns about pharmacists' experiences during this first period of COVID-19 vaccination services in community pharmacies, which is relevant for informing policy and organisational decision makers about the feasibility and acceptability of pharmacy vaccination. METHODS: Individual interviews were conducted with 13 pharmacists in community pharmacies offering a COVID-19 vaccination service. Informants were recruited from the eleven pharmacies that first offered COVID-19 vaccinations. The key themes in the interview were COVID-19 vaccination, what the pharmacists think about the vaccination service, and how it is performed. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: Three main themes and eight subthemes were identified. The main themes were creative solutions, organising and making resources available, and professionally satisfying and an important mission. The interviewed pharmacists experienced the COVID-19 vaccination service as hectic but something important that they would prioritise. They experienced their efforts to be substantial in the pandemic's early phase. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists in community pharmacies were a resource for increasing the vaccination rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pharmacies' easy accessibility and the pharmacists' ability to adjust their daily workflow for a new service should be considered when an expanded healthcare service is needed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 168, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 481, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 776, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 878, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 938, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1350, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1633, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37987391, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Pharmacy (Basel)", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Aarnes RV", "Nilsen MK"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Viremia is rare in infected pregnant women, and the virus is seldom amplified from placental tissues. Definite and probable placental infection requires the demonstration of viral RNA or proteins using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Small subsets (1.0-7.9%, median 2.8%) of placentas of SARS-CoV-2-positive women showed definite infection accompanied by a characteristic histopathology named SARS-CoV-2 placentitis (SP). The conventionally accepted histopathological criteria for SP include the triad of intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition, and trophoblast necrosis. SP was shown to be independent of the clinical severity of the infection, but associated with stillbirth in cases where destructive lesions affecting more than 75% of the placental tissue resulted in placental insufficiency and severe fetal hypoxic-ischemic injury. An association between maternal thrombophilia and SP was shown in a subset of cases, suggesting a synergy of the infection and deficient coagulation cascade as one of the mechanisms of the pathologic accumulation of fibrin in affected placentas. The virus was amplified from fetal tissues in approximately 40% of SP cases, but definite fetal involvement demonstrated using ISH or IHC is exceptionally rare. The placental pathology in SARS-CoV-2-positive women also includes chronic lesions associated with placental malperfusion in the absence of definite or probable placental infection. The direct viral causation of the vascular malperfusion of the placenta in COVID-19 is debatable, and common predispositions (hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) may play a role.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "CoV-2 infection", "locations": [{"offset": 127, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014766", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Viremia", "locations": [{"offset": 175, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 194, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 212, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 309, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 491, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 511, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 533, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 596, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009336", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "necrosis", "locations": [{"offset": 772, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 845, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D050497", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stillbirth", "locations": [{"offset": 876, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010927", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "placental insufficiency", "locations": [{"offset": 982, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D020925", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypoxic-ischemic injury", "locations": [{"offset": 1023, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019851", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "thrombophilia", "locations": [{"offset": 1080, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "synergy of the infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1146, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001778", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deficient coagulation", "locations": [{"offset": 1175, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1482, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1502, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1626, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1712, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 1763, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003920", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "diabetes", "locations": [{"offset": 1777, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 1791, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37987372, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D019851", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D006973", "disease@MESH:D050497", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D009336", "disease@MESH:D009765", "disease@MESH:D001778", "disease@MESH:D014766", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D020925", "disease@MESH:D003920", "species@2697049", "disease@MESH:D010927"], "journal": "J Dev Biol", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Debelenko L"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Essential, primary, or idiopathic hypertension accounts for 90-95% of all cases. Identifying novel biomarkers specific to essential hypertension may help in understanding pathophysiological pathways and developing personalized treatments. We tested whether the integration of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and clinical risk factors via machine learning modeling may provide useful information and novel tools for essential hypertension diagnosis and management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 174 participants were enrolled in the present observational case-control study, among which, there were 89 patients with essential hypertension and 85 controls. A discovery phase was conducted using small RNA sequencing in whole blood samples obtained from age- and sex-matched hypertension patients (n = 30) and controls (n = 30). A validation phase using RT-qPCR involved the remaining 114 participants. For machine learning, 170 participants with complete data were used to generate and evaluate the classification model. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing identified seven miRNAs downregulated in hypertensive patients as compared with controls in the discovery group, of which six were confirmed with RT-qPCR. In the validation group, miR-210-3p/361-3p/362-5p/378a-5p/501-5p were also downregulated in hypertensive patients. A machine learning support vector machine (SVM) model including clinical risk factors (sex, BMI, alcohol use, current smoker, and hypertension family history), miR-361-3p, and miR-501-5p was able to classify hypertension patients in a test dataset with an AUC of 0.90, a balanced accuracy of 0.87, a sensitivity of 0.83, and a specificity of 0.91. While five miRNAs exhibited substantial downregulation in hypertension patients, only miR-361-3p and miR-501-5p, alongside clinical risk factors, were consistently chosen in at least eight out of ten sub-training sets within the SVM model. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential significance of miRNA-based biomarkers in deepening our understanding of hypertension's pathophysiology and in personalizing treatment strategies. The strong performance of the SVM model highlights its potential as a valuable asset for diagnosing and managing essential hypertension. The model remains to be extensively validated in independent patient cohorts before evaluating its added value in a clinical setting.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "1", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 103, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002318", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiovascular diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 158, "length": 23}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 217, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 315, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 607, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "6", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 683, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 786, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 810, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 957, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 970, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1071, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "participants", "locations": [{"offset": 1111, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertensive", "locations": [{"offset": 1275, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1288, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertensive", "locations": [{"offset": 1481, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1494, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000431", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "alcohol", "locations": [{"offset": 1601, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 1634, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "100500908", "type": "Gene"}, "text": "miR-361-3p", "locations": [{"offset": 1664, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 1712, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1725, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 1910, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1923, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "100500908", "type": "Gene"}, "text": "miR-361-3p", "locations": [{"offset": 1938, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 2214, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006973", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypertension", "locations": [{"offset": 2411, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2486, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37987360, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1700887048825}, "accessions": ["gene@100500908", "disease@MESH:D006973", "chemical@MESH:D000431", "disease@MESH:D002318", "species@9606"], "journal": "Noncoding RNA", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Jusic A", "Junuzovic I", "Hujdurovic A", "Zhang L", "Vausort M", "Devaux Y"]}
