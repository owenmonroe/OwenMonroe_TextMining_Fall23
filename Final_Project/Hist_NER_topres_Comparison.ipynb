    "This notebook evaluates NER models and tagging, comparing the topres historical NER model to my own hand-annotated data. The \"topres\" model was found on huggingface and is trained on historical english language newspapers. The text data comes from downloaded files from the Hathi-Trust Digital Library. These texts are 19th Century Magazines from the publishers, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, the William and Robert Chambers, and the Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge among the Chinese.

       "Sentence[2851]: \"he principal mountains of France are, 1. The   Toeget on the north-east. They are of a rounded oat-   Bne, with gentle slopes, and afford much open paa-   turage. The highest summit is not more than 4500   ftet nigh. 2. The Jura mountains He to the south of   these, and their summiu rise to the height of 0000   feet. 3. Many Alpine branches intersect Daaphlny   and Provence. In the ceotre of the kingdom are, 4.   The mountains of Auvergne, of volcamo origin, of   which the Puy de Dome, the Moots d'Or, and the   Cental, are the principal groups. 5. The Cerennee   Be to the south-east of the range last mentioned.   Their highest summit Is Mont Lozcre (about C510   Ihet). 0. The Pyrenees form the prlnnipai part of the   boundary between France and Spain. These moun-   tains divide the cou.utry into four great basins, the   form and exposure of which necessarily have a great   influence on their climate and productions. The nar-   row valley of the Rhine runs from nortli to <ioutIi,   while the open basins of the Seine, the Loire, and the   Garonne, stretch iu a north -weslt^rn direction. The   Adour rises in the Pyrenees, and washes the walls of   Bayonne. The other rivers are principally tributa-   jfes. The Marne and the Oise fall into tne Seine;   the Allier, the Loire, the Sarthe, and the Maycnne,   into the Loire ; the Rhone receives the Saoue, the   Isire, the Durance, the Ain, and the Sorgue ; the   Tarn and the Dordi^e join the Garonne. The nu-   merous branches of these rivers are joined by canals,   which form an extensive internal water communication.     In resprct to soil, the richest part of France is the   north-west division, comprehending the provinces of   Flanders, Artuis, Picardy, Normandy, and the Isle   of France, where there is a deep rich loam; about   18,I70,51>0 acres in extent. The valley of the Ga-   ronne ia composed of a friable sandy loam, with a   calcareous mixture, and moisture suthcient for every   purpose. This district contains 7)054,501 acres. The   greet valley of Languedoc is extremely prolific, though   the toil is not so fine as that of the preceding districts.   The Limarne, a valley of Auvergne, Is considered   to have one of the finest stjils in the world. It con-   atsts of beds of earth, said to be twenty feet deep,   formed from the deojmposition of soft basalt. The   calcareous and chalk formations are extensive. Tlie   chalk provinces are unfruitful in grain, but the genial   Influence of the sun allows them other riches. The   calcarroiis loam on the borders of the chalk formation   is more productive. In Bretagne, Anjou, and Maine,   are immense heaths. The lanite$ are J^xtensive tracts   of sandy deserts, producing nothing but broom, heath,   and Junipers. The most extensive are the landes of   Bordeaux, twenty leagues in length by twelve In   breadth. In the remaining provinces, gravel, or a   gravelly sand, is the predominating soil. The woods   and forests are estimated to oover a space of 10,795,000   acres. The principal are tlioseof Ardennes, Orleans,   and For.taincl'leau. The northern and western coasts   are formed iu a great proportion by immense downs   or sandbanks, and where the shores are formed by   cliffs, they are seidnrii bold enough to be approached   with safety. The harlwurs are therefore tew. On   the Mediterranean, the cout of Languedoc is very   dangerous, but Provence abuands in good barbourt.   The culture, throughout the northern half of the   kingdom, consists of wheat, barley, oats, pulsct *nd of   lata, much more than formerlv, of poutoes ; Iu (he   eoawem half, com (particularly malie), vintf, mtil.   t iMilMb w4 oUtm.

The most common fuel is wood.     The superficial extent of France has been recently   estimated by Baron Dupin at 53,533,430 hecures,   or 139,094,000 English acres. The value of ca-   piul vested in agricultural pursuits Is estimated at   37.532,061,470 francs: the gross annual produce at   4,(>78,70R,805 francs ; the expenses of cultivation at   3,334,005,.'>15; leaving a profit of 31 per cent, on the   capital. The produce of wheat in the best cultivated   distrlcu, and on the best soil, hardly exceeds eighteen   bushels per acre : an English farmer exptcu twenty-   five or the same extent. In 1813, the number of   horstk A France was 9,170,000 ( but in 1810, the   horsMs and mules together amountad only to 1 }657,C7 1 ;   at present the number is estimated at 2,500,000. The   number of homed cattle Is 6,073,000 1 of sheep, about   45,0e^000. The total number of all kinds of poultry   is about 51,600,000. The French are tbe best wine-   makers in the world. The Champagne, Burgundy,   Claret, Hermitage, are drunk all over the world. For   a long time, the choicest growths were in the hands   of the church ; and in the frequent changes of pre   party which have taken place since the revolution,   many vineyards have deteriorated in consequ..noe of   bad management. The brandies of France are the   best in the world. The value of the whole produce of   V ine and brandy Is about 800,000,000 of fianos. The   culture of the vine Is supposed to have Increased nearly   one-fourth since the revolntion, owing principally to   the small proprietors, each of whom endeavours to   supply his own consumption by a little patch of vine-   yard. M. Dupin says that many hectarca of f ranch   territory are 3*01 uncultivated, merely for want of cat-   tle to stock und manure them ; that twcthirda of the   inhabitaattf are without aalmal food ; that more than   oue-third subsist entirely on oats, buckwheat, rye,   chestnuts, or potatoe0» and that the agricultural popu-   lation is loo great for the prosperity of France. Two-   thirds of the population is agrioulturaL     France possesses a soil and climate capable of fur-   nlahlng her with uil the raw materials of mauufactare   except cotton. The manufacture of fine woollen   cloths at Sedan wu introduced under the auspices of   Colbert. The machinery used was very defective un-   til M. Chaptal engaged an English machinist to In-   struct the French aruxans. Steam.engines are rare ;   the spinning mills being worked chiefly by water or   by horses. The quantity of native wool manufactured   in 1819.was 38,000,000 kilogrammes (of about 3|lbs.   each), and, in 1836, 4^,000,000, with H,000,000 of im-   ported wool : the value of the roanuiactured articles   was 305,000,000 francs ; of the raw wool, 105,000,000 :   the quantity exported was about one-thirteenth of the   whole quantity manufactured. By the exertions of   Henry IV., the mulberry.tree was cultivated in all the   southern provinces. At Tours, silk stuffs for furniture   are chiefly manufactured ; at Ganges, and other places   in the Cevennes, silk stockings. Lyons is the princi-   pal place for silk manufactures of all kinds. Paris   ranks next after Lyons. In 181'.!, the value of the   raw material amounted to 45,500,(HIO francs, of which   33,000,000 were the price of imported silk. The va-   lue of manufactured goods, at the same period, was   107,500,000 francs, m' which less than one-third was   exported. Forty years ago, the spinning of cotton by   machinery waa hardly practised in France. Cotton   mills have l>een established within that period, and   the manufactures of Alsace are now superior to those   of England in the brilliaucy of their colours. In 11113,   l0,:Ui3,000 kilogrammes of oitton were spun by ma-   chinery, and, iit 1H2A, 'JM,(M)0,000 of greater fineness.   The cambrics, gaiue, aiul lawn of St Quentin, Valen-   ciennes, and Cambray, are among the most valuable   products of French Industry. Lace is made in great   quantities.     The whole produce of the linen and hemp manu-   factures is estimated at 300,00(»,000 francs. L. 1814,   100,000,000 kilogrammes of cast-iron were produced ;   in 1825, 180,000,000. <IildinK tnd watch-making are   carried on, chiefly in Paris, t>> the annual value of   about 38,000,000 francs each. Printing also employs   a great number of persons at Paris. In IRU, the   number of printed sheets was 45,075,030; in 1820,   80,031,303 ; and in 1830, 144,58I,(MI4. NotwJth.   standing the low price of labour iu France, the in-   dustry of that c<iuntry cannot enter into competition   withUiatof England. One of the circumstances which   depress it is the want of internal communication by   roads and canals. The practicable roads of France   are not more than one-third of the extent of those of   England. The cross-roeds are few, and the great   roads are seldom kept in good order. The length of   the canals in France is not more than one- eleventh of   those of England. Another point in which France is   inferior is in the use of steam.engines, attributable In   part to the deficiency of coal, or the dlHiculty of trans-   porting it. The total force of steam-engines iu France,   according to Dupin, is ecpial to Jiat ol 480,(f(K> men ;   that of England is equal to a powei of li,44K),OlN) men.   All the power derived from machinery of every sort,   or from constructive ingenuity, and applied to pur-   poses of industry in France, is tinly one-fourth of the   similar power employed in England.     The commerce ot France has l>ecn vary ranch di-   minished by the loss of her colonies. The value of   the cokinial importa, in 1788, was 337,0tW,'i00 francs ;   iti 1834, it waa only 50,000,000. The exporu for   17«lMMWrtiil«U9/>00}009( in iaM,to44,00(^0«0.     The total value of exports from France, in 1834, was   440,543,000 francs t of which 103,050,000 were pro.   ductions of the country, and 277,486,000 manufactured   articles. The amount exported to the United States   waa 55,000,000, being more than that to any other   country. The imports for the same year were of the   value of 454,801,000 francs; of which 373,873,000   franoswerersw materials for manufacture, 121. 9r)7,000   natural productions for consumption, and 00,o:tO,000   manufactured articles. In 1824, the number of sailora   in French ships was 328,480 ; of whom 28,040 were   engaged in foreign commerce, 47,383 in the fisheries,   and the remainder in the coasting trade. The navy,   according to the budget of 1838, consisted of 38 ships   of the iioe, 35 frigates, 8 steam.boaU, and 186 other   veasels, and 14,003 officera and sailors. The army la   1828 amounted to 233,770 men, and was recruited by   voluntary enlistment and annual levies, every French-   man of twenty years of age being bound to serve for   a term of eight years. The reoelpu of 1828 were   l,037,iO4,4»l francs; the expenditure, 1,035,415,552   franos.     As we have glren the history of the French Revo-   lution of 1780 in another portion of the present work   (No. 9), nothing need here be said of that event. It   is suflident to state that the military character which   was engrafted upon the nation by subsequent eventa   still predominates, and may be described as one of the   main causes fur the deficiency of France in manufac-   tures, comn.eroe, wealth, and many comforts of social   life. The character of the Frei«oh, however. Is fwt   undergoing an improvement under the constitution   which the country has enjoyv.d since 1830, when   Louis Philip waa placed on the throne, by the events   of what are termed the \" three days,** or the revolu-   tion which deposed the elder line of the Bourbons.   The present reigning family, or house of Orleans, le   a collateral line of ^e former branch, being derived   from the onlv brother of Louis XIV., Philip Duke of   Orleans.

       "Sentence[2167]: \"VISIT TO AN ENGLISH MONASTERY. I HAVE always felt a deep interest in monks and monkery, and an interest that did not commence with my historical period, but may be traced far back in the fabulous Radcliffian era. I knew of course that there I was received by a venerable-looking monk, in a were monks in England, but could never believe them light drab habit reaching to his ankles, who with to be anything more than imitation monks. An Italian much kindness of manner bade me welcome. He con- or a Spanish monk I could understand, and, spite of ducted me to an inner room of the Gate-house, where I the chronic revolution now going on, I had not alto-wrote my name in the visitors' book; and we then gether withdrawn my faith from a French monk. But crossed a quadrangular court to the Guest-Hall, where an English monk seemed highly improbable. I was tea and other refreshments had been prepared. While once invited to visit the Benedictine convent at Ham-gazing round me like a man in a strange country, a mersmith; but that was quite too much. Hammersmith! swell of music rose suddenly upon my ear. As if a name like that was compatible with a genuine convent! Besides, I myself knew the sister of the abbess; and a nice, kind, frank little lady she was, who drank tea and spoke prose as like other people as possible. Such considerations set the Benedictines completely out of the question; but my curiosity, after a hard struggle with my unbelief, was at length aroused by the reports that reached me from time to time concerning another religious establishment. This was the monastery of Mount St Bernard in Leicestershire -a sufficiently probable name, it must be confessed, notwithstanding its associations with fat cattle and improved breeds. Perhaps the considerable distance of the county from my usual place of abode formed an element in the feasibility of the thing; but at anyrate I did send a missive to the Fathers, to acquaint them, in what I was told was the prescribed form, with my intention to pay them a visit; and half-interested, half- pooh-poohish, I actually set out for an English monas- tery. My letter was forwarded through the penny-post; I travelled myself by rail. On arriving at the nearest station, which is six miles from the abbey, I found that the good Fathers had provided a conveyance for me, drawn by a pony, and driven by an Irishman. The pony was sedate and slow, as became a conventual horse; and the Irishman was in a hurry neither with his words nor actions, but sat quietly on his box like a monumental figure of Resignation. The consequence was that the shades of evening fell thickly around us before our arrival, and that seen through them the adventure began to look respectable. I was on my way to a monastery-to the monastery of St Bernard. I was to eat in its refectory, to pray at its vespers, to sleep in its dormitory. In England, it is true, where the people would mob a Capuchin as they would a Bloomerite; and in a county where short horns are the chief local celebrities: but no matter. The evening was dark and preternaturally silent; and when at length we stopped at a large, 'It is the brethren in the choir,' said the guest- master, observing me start, who are finishing their evening devotions. That is the \"Salve Regina,” or hymn to the Virgin; and when I hear its last cadence, my day is at an end, and my lips must no more open except in prayer.' When the solemn chant died away, a bell rang, called the angelus, and the guest - master and his assistant, a lay-brother, immediately facing about, sank on their knees before a fine picture of the Crucifixion. Here they said their angelus; and the guest-master, who had missed the service in the choir in consequence of his attendance upon me, went through his office-apparently a long ritual before rising from his knees. During this interval-though hardly feeling that it was germane to the place and time I was busily engaged, at the pressing instance of the lay-brother, in discussing a very interesting tea and delicious omelet. - 6 When the monk had finished his devotions and I my refreshment, he laid a book before me, and pointing to a section, seemed to desire that I should read it. It proved to be a short lesson on monastic obedience; and when I had finished, he conducted me to the cloisters, and through them to the church, a large and gloomy edifice, lighted only by the dim but ever-burning lamp of the sanctuary. It was from this building I had heard the solemn swell of the Salve Regina,' given forth by the united voices of forty monks; but now our own footsteps were the only sounds that broke the awful stillness of the place. The monk, with his muffled figure, and slow, calm pace, went on before me into the choir, and knelt before the altar. This appeared to be the sole purpose for which he had entered the church, since he could hold no communication with me; and as I stood behind his motionless figure, and watched the faint play of the solitary lamp, lost in the profound darkness beyond, a feeling akin to superstitious terror took possession of me. I do not know how long the silent monk remained on his knees, but it must have    ## p. 338 (#350) ############################################  338 CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL. been a considerable time; and when at length he rose and glided away as before, I followed him with a sensation of relief. I followed him out of the church, across the quadrangle, and into the bedroom where I was to pass the night; when my conductor, waving his hand in adieu, left the room, and I found myself alone. Alone, in a real monastery, inhabited by real monks -and all this in England! The idea was not easily grappled with. At first view the thing was improbable: but there I was. There was nothing unreal in the fire that blazed before me, and threw a flickering light into the room; nor in the roof, with its black rafters; nor in the small tent-bedstead, with its drab moreen curtains the livery of the monks themselves; nor in the prie-dieu, with the prayer-desk by its side, standing on the uncarpeted floor; nor in the dressing - table, looking-glass, and stone fender; nor in the pictures of the saints, that moved and nodded in the fitful light upon the walls: but somehow the real was mingled with the unreal; and as I sat staring into the fire, I saw distinctly the shadows of the Confessional of the Black Penitents; and once I turned fairly round to look for that mysterious monk who had appointed to meet with the young Montorio in a similar place. Perhaps the reader remembers that as the hour of tryst approached, Montorio became impatient, and looked eagerly round the empty room for his expected visitor; till, on raising his eyes again as the clock struck, he beheld the monk calmly seated at the table, with his eyes fixed on the dial. I sat thus for a considerable time, immersed in wild but pleasing imaginations, and at length went to bed and fell asleep. Then my waking thoughts were repeated in my dreams, and I was following through some dark corridor a tall, dim, gliding figure, when suddenly my steps were arrested, and my sleep broken by the deep tones of a bell. I found it was one o'clock; and this doubtless was the sound that summoned the monks to matins. I thought drowsily for a time of the heroism of their devotion; but sleep was once more descending on my eyes, when a slow and dolorous chant stole across the courtyard and through my little pointed window, and I could distinctly hear the voices of the monks sending on high their morning-hymn. The cadence had scarcely died away, when I was again in the land of dreams; but after a time-it might have been two or three hours-the deep solemn bell awoke me anew, sounding, as I was afterwards told, for prime; and as it continued at intervals I slept no more. At half-past six I heard a knock at my door; and on answering Come in,' a strange figure entered, enveloped in a dark habit, and looking not unlike one of the witches in 'Macbeth.' He carried a light, a long brush, and a coal-box; and after having kindled the fire and swept the hearth, was about to retire, when I asked him a question concerning the weather. His reply was merely to put his finger on his lips, and with an unintelligible growl he left the apartment. I may mention here, what I learned afterwards, that there were eight bedchambers, all uniform with the one I occupied. Shortly after, the guest-master appeared with a jug of hot water, and cheerfully wished me good-morning, hoping I had slept comfortably. He informed me that breakfast would be ready at half-past eight, but that high-mass was performed in the church every morning at half-past seven, at which all the guests were expected to be present. After breakfast the abbot himself would come and bid me welcome, and he requested me to be in my room to receive him. After the guest-master had taken his departure, I got up and made my toilet, during which process the bell struck thrice-the premo- nitory signal, as the guest-master had told me, for mass, and intended to give the priests time to put on their After this the bells rang at two intervals, vestments. as they did for all the other services, and I proceeded to the church. I was shewn into the rood - loft, the place appropriated for the guests, and found two or three before me. The monks were all in their stalls reciting a short preliminary office, and the priests were at the altar, which was prepared with six large lighted candles and other paraphernalia, for the performance of high-mass. This, it seems, was a festival-day, and the abbot was to sing high-mass himself. The office being over, the priests went into the sacristy, from which they soon returned in procession, accompanied by the abbot in his pontificals, including the mitre and crosier, and preceded by his cross-bearer and acolytes, or boys bearing lights and incense. Shortly before the conclusion of mass a monk brought us books interlined with music, which I perceived were the Processionale or ritual of processions. Accordingly, at the conclusion of mass, a procession moved round the church and cloisters, which the guests, wound up to a pitch of sentimental excitement at least I can answer for myself-did not dare to refuse joining. The chanting continued during the procession until we regained the church, when a short service was performed at the altar; and so far as we were concerned the religious service of the morning was at an end, when we hastened, cold and hungry, into the guest-hall, where a plain breakfast awaited us. The only thing worth notice in the meal was, that it included no meat, that being an article which is strictly prohibited from entering the monastery. -\" → [\"England\"/LOC, \"Gate-house\"/BUILDING, \"Guest-Hall\"/BUILDING, \"Benedictine\"/BUILDING, \"Ham-gazing\"/LOC, \"Mount St Bernard\"/LOC, \"Leicestershire\"/LOC, \"St Bernard\"/LOC, \"England\"/LOC, \"EDINBURGH\"/LOC, \"England\"/LOC]"

       "Sentence[2192]: \"## p. 1 (#11) ###############################################  CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL LITERATURE, SCIENCE, AND ART Fourth Sexiez CONDUCTED BY WILLIAM AND ROBERT No. 419. OF POPULAR SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1872. A GOLDEN CHAMBERS. CHAPTER I.-CANDIDATES. MIRIAM CLINT was about to leave school. She was not glad of it. She was eighteen years old, and had her notions and her visions about 'coming out,' like other girls of her age, and especially of her appearance. The time to which these notions would naturally have tended, and these visions soared, was at hand, and yet Miriam Clint was not glad of it. This is a paradox which requires explanation. Miriam had every reason to believe that her visions would remain entirely unfulfilled; she had good cause to like the school at which she had passed eight years, in tolerable comfort to herself, and harmony with her surroundings; and she had no cause whatever to like home, or to anticipate that it would be more endurable when she should have returned thither 'for good,' than it had been during her dismal holidays. BY THE AUTHOR OF A HOUSE OF CARDS.' I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born, And range with humble livers in content, Than to be perked up in a glistering grief, And wear a golden sorrow. Miriam was not of a sentimental disposition, but she had strong feelings, and a good deal of decision of character, a combination which had made her a favourite at Miss Monitor's school. She was in earnest in her likes and dislikes; and being as good-natured as a clever, healthy girl usually is, especially when she is freely acknow- ledged to be much prettier than her companions, her likes were more numerous than her dislikes. Thus, there was commotion and dismay at Cres- cent House, Hampstead, when it became known that Mr Clint had refused to accede to Miriam's petition for 'one more half,' and that she was to go home immediately. Miriam became more emphatically than ever a 'poor darling; and Mr Clint, her father, who had always been considered a 'horrid man,' now received public mention as an old brute.' There was less injustice than VOL. IX. SORROW. PRICE 11d. Shakspeare. usually attends a sweeping censure in this designa- tion. Mr Clint was an old brute. Until within three days of breaking-up time, Miriam had hoped to gain her father's consent to her remaining at Crescent House, not because she wished to remain, and counted on his indulgence for that reason, but because she honestly believed he must dislike the prospect of her return as much as she did. \" 'It is impossible I can ever be anything but a tremendous bore to papa, you know,' she said, frankly, to Miss Monitor, with whom she was on confidential terms. Every one bores him, you know, but Walter and I bore him above and beyond every one else. I suppose it is just for appearances' sake he wants me home, and I can't help hoping he won't be able to resist the tempta- tion of getting rid of me for six more months.' Miss Monitor shook her tight little head, and replied: 'My dear, I should not count on that, if I were you. If your papa is having you home against his inclination, or even without it, for appearances' sake, I can only say it is the first time I have ever heard of his making such a sacrifice. No, no, Miriam ; depend upon it, you will have to go.' Miss Monitor was right. Suspense in the school- room, and hope in the breast of Miriam and her young friends, were put an end to by the arrival of the post on the following morning. Miriam opened her father's letter, and the first glance dissipated her hopes. THE FIRS, 3d June 18-. Dr Miriam [ There!' was the girl's mental com- mentary; he is always more ill-tempered than usual when he uses abbreviations! What ill- tempered and ill-bred things they are!']-You have    ## p. 2 (#12) ###############################################  2 CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL. given me the trouble of writing two letters instead of one. Don't do that again. You will come home as arranged, on the 6th; I have put an advt for a maid in some mg papers, and directed applicants to call at Crest House to-morrow between the hours of 12 and 4. From among them you will select, with Miss M.'s advice, a suitable person, to attend upon you, make your clothes, &c. Wages L.20. The person you select must be ready to come here with you on the 6th. You will come by express, leaving Lond. Bge at 11 A.M.-Yrs truly, REG. CLINT. Tears of anger rose in Miriam's eyes. It isn't only that he refuses my request, but he puts it aside in such a cold, contemptuous way,' she muttered; I shall never be able to care for him in the least, or get on better with him; and I did mean to try. It's well for Walter he's a man ; he can do as he likes; he is not obliged to stay at home, and put up with papa. I don't wonder at him; I couldn't blame him for anything !' 'Miriam,' said Miss Monitor, entering the room with her accustomed precision of step and manner, but with a decided increase of the winter-apple colouring of her plump cheeks, 'I need not ask you what news you have. Your father treats me with scanty courtesy, and I suppose blames me for your unwillingness to go home. He might recog- nise that at least you have been happy here.' 'He doesn't care, dear,' said Miriam, flinging her arms round Miss Monitor's prim little figure with an energy that caused that lady to rock upon her tightly shod little feet, and obliged her to rearrange her collar, her apron, her cuffs, and her neck-ribbon. He doesn't know anything about my being happy or unhappy, and as for gratitude! well, never mind that. I'm grateful, and I always shall be.' 'I am sure of that,' said Miss Monitor; and then perhaps remembering that the tone in which they were discussing Miriam's father was not quite most appropriate to their mutual relation, she changed it for one of admonition mingled with consolation. Miriam listened with ill-disguised impatience, and then shewed how very little she understood the principle of that filial obedience and reverence which Miss Monitor was, with some inconsistency, endeavouring to instil into her, by assuring her impetuously that she would do her very best to put up with' her father for Miss Monitor's sake. } Miss Monitor had some reason to be offended with Mr Clint. His letter to her contained the following words: Dr Madam-Be so good as to acknowledge by return the enclosed cheque for amt of yr acct, and to send Miss Clint home, according to my directions.-Yrs truly, REG. CLINT.' Miss Monitor was not a high-minded woman, but neither was she a humbug. She did not 'train the minds of her pupils,' as the modern style of prospectus has it, to any transcendental heights of principle or feeling; she made no professions of horror at the notion of a lady's boarding-school being a speculation intended to pay, for she had intended hers to pay, and it was paying, and no woman in the world knew better than she did that no school could be really like home, if home were all it should be. But she knew equally well, and practically, that honesty is the best policy; and she was honest according to her light. She liked Miriam Clint, but she had no accurate compre- hension of either her strength or her weaknesses; and she could hardly have been expected perfectly to understand how much the girl stood in need of pity, who would have genuinely preferred to remain at Crescent House rather than return to her father's roof. To Miriam, duty translated itself by 'devoirs,' and pleasure meant going to select evening parties, and occasionally to the opera, with one or two other favoured pupils, under the auspices of Miss Monitor; and taking riding lessons in the early summer mornings, with her particular school-friends, on which occasions the riding- master was accompanied by his pretty young wife. Nothing could be more proper or more pleasant, Miriam then thought. She hated leaving all this, and she hated the thought of the home she was going to. The position of affairs seemed to absolve Miss Monitor and Miriam from any bonds of conven- tional restraint. I never was a hypocrite about it, was I, dear?' said Miriam. 'Don't you remember, long ago, when we did our compositions for Mr Walker, I never would write letters about the pleasures of home and the delights of the country? There is no pleasure in home to me, and I always did and always shall hate the country.' 'Don't say that, Miriam,' said Miss Monitor, with a wise shake of her head. You would like it very much if you were married to a country gentleman with a nice property.' Miss Monitor's own vision of ultimate bliss was retirement to a cottage, with a cow and a poultry-yard. 'Depend on it, that would make all the difference. And, remember, you must have gone home in order for that to happen. You couldn't have married here.' 6 'I'm not so sure of that,' said Miriam impetu- ously; but then, recollecting herself, she added with some confusion: At least-I mean, something might have turned up, you know. However, it is all over now, and there's no good in talking about it; but of one thing you may be certain, if ever I marry a country gentleman, he must be well enough off to take me away from the country-no rurality for me.' The dialogue was interrupted by Jane, a trim parlour-maid, who informed her mistress that a young person' had called about the maid's place for Miss Clint. There was an additional shade of respect in Jane's manner of mentioning Miriam, a recognition of her added dignity in the prospective possession of her own maid. 'Take her into the waiting-room, and say I will see her presently,' said Miss Monitor; and then added, when Jane withdrew: 'Go and smooth your hair, Miriam, and make yourself tidy before you see this person. It would never do for her to see you looking like that.' 'Oh, what can it matter?' said Miriam rebel- liously, in the thoroughness of her ill-humour and discontent. The question is, whether she will suit me, not whether I shall suit her.' \"There is a little of both in the question, my dear,' replied Miss Monitor decisively; and it is always worth every one's while to make a favour- able impression.' This was one of those lessons which Miss Monitor might be fully trusted to administer conscientiously to her pupils. Miriam ran up-stairs to her own room, as the\" → [\"Cres- cent House\"/BUILDING, \"Hampstead\"/LOC, \"Crescent House\"/BUILDING, \"Crest House\"/BUILDING, \"Lond.

(#20) #################################################  objects which this Society has in view and methods of operation   are detailed in the Constitution which accompanies this. It may,   however, be well to note that our aim summarised, is two-fold: namely,     (1) to provide books of a comparatively high order for the more     intelligent classes in China; and (2), books illustrated by chromos for   the families. We wish in no way to interfere with the action of any   Bible Societies or \\ ract Societies, or the School and Text Book Series   Committee, or any private enterprise already existing; we seek to follow   out a line of work which is distinct, and which has hitherto not been   attempted on any scale proportionate to its importance.     ^ criptures and Tracts have their place and their unalienable     importance; and ever will. School and Text Books are also   indispensable for Seminaries and Colleges; but they are of their   nature technical, and adapted to be explained by a teacher. Purely   scientific books, again, are necessarily full of new terms and formulae,   and so beyond the ability of ordinary readers. Our object, therefore,   is to reach the general public, both literary and commercial, and while   we give them true science, endeavour at the same time to set it forth in   an attractive manner fitted to their present capacity for understanding   it. And our reasons for this new effort are:—     ^ uch objects are in keeping with the genius of the people. The     great distinguishing feature of the Chinese from the very earliest   times has been their attachment to literature, and the honour they   have set upon it. Their hero has been not the warrior, nor even the   statesman, but the scholar. This national sentiment has been fruitful   of many beneficent results. Amongst others it has led them, during   all their eras, to pay very great attention to education; and this, in   its turn, has produced a large proportion of readers, a high regard for   books, one uniform written language, and a system of competitive   examinations which until recent years was unparalleled in any part   of the world.       ## p. (#21) #################################################  7     CVhese features have struck every observer who has landed on their   shores, and led all who sought to influence the empire, to seek to   avail themselves of the press. But the question has always been in   regard to suitable books. The difficulties of the language, the peculiarities   of Chinese modes of thought and expression, and their tremendous   literature, which required to be mastered less or more before efficient   books could be produced, called a halt.     CV/N the opening days of modern intercourse missionaries felt it to be   their first duty to give them the Scriptures in their own tongue,   and epitomes of Divine Truth in different forms. But it has been   increasingly felt by all, of late years, that something more was needed.   Accordingly, not a few have been led to compose works on Geography,   History, Astronomy, and the various branches of science, and also to   attempt periodical literature in its different branches.     t*> mall editions of these works have been issued and they have been   prized in proportion as they became known. This has encouraged   us to proceed in that direction; but larger funds are needed to spread   such books even to a moderate extent in this wide empire. And this   is well worth the effort of all interested in China: for it is absolutely   clear that we can never open up the country satisfactorily until we   open the minds of the people.     S he opposition which is offered to Western views, plans, and efforts   of all kinds mercantile, political, and religious, is almost entirely   due to ignorance. And this is true both as regards local officials, the   gentry or literati, the censorate, and even of some of the high officials   in Peking. It is therefore of the very highest importance that this   ignorance be dispelled, and knowledge diffused through all classes of   the people.     .vvj oeeovee we have found that in cases where high officials at   ( 3 ^ Peking and enlightened Mandarins were prepared to accede to   foreign proposals, the local literati interfered, and effectually blocked   all proceedings. But these literati abound in every part of the empire,   and are held in the highest esteem; in fact are the very soul of the   empire and virtually rule it. It is therefore manifest that if we would   influence China at all as a nation, we must begin with them; and also   that it is only in proportion as we command their respect that affairs will   move smoothly in China, especially in the higher and larger departments.\" → [\"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Chinamen\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Glasgow\"/LOC, \"Shanghai\"/LOC, \"Hongkong\"/LOC, \"Yokohama\"/LOC, \"Singapore\"/LOC, \"Penang\"/LOC, \"Batavia\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Peking\"/LOC, \"Peking\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC]"

       "Sentence[1918]: \"## p. (#5) ##################################################  IReport     W E have much to rejoice us this year in the various departments of   our Society’s work.     Our Publications.     The Grace Examinations to commemorate the Empress Dowager   reaching the age of 60 were held simultaneously in September. It is a   high gratification to us to announce that through special funds, appealed   for to meet this special occasion, we succeeded in sending 6,000 of our   publications to each of the ten maritime provinces, making 60,000 in   all. 720,000 pages were thus distributed gratis, a number far in advance   of anything our Society has ever done before.     Another ambition of ours was the establishment of Branch Depdts   in the provinces for the sale of our Publications. We have now Depots   in Peking, in Moukden, in Tientsin, Shensi, in Nanking and in Chefoo,   with the small supply of $100 worth of literature in each to start with.     The work which will make this year most memorable however, is   the republication of Dr. Faber’s great work on Civilization , a book in   5 Chinese Volumes, and treating of all the leading forces of Western   Civilization. Thanks to the generosity of the Rev. P. Kranz we have   published an edition of two thousand copies, so that we shall be able   to present all the great Mandarins of the Empire with a copy each.     We have also republished the work which the late Dr. Williamson   was publishing when he died, viz: What a Nation Needs . This is at the   request of the members of the English Baptist Mission, who wish to   have it for circulation and who meet the expense of publication. But   the stereotyping of several of these works for future use has involved   considerable expense.     The book on the Benefits of Christianity has been sold out at its full   cost price, and a new edition has therefore been ordered.       ## p. (#6) ##################################################  8     We have published Mr. George Jamieson’s Article on English Law   in China. The outline of the Rise and Progress of the Christian En¬   deavour movement, now numbering millions of followers, published   in the Missionary Review , was republished by the United Society of   Christian Endeavour for China, and stereotyped by us. Dr. Faber’s   Chinese Theories of Human Nature is in press. Miss Harvie, Secretary of   the Ladies’ Society in Glasgow, has sent us a box of the beautiful   chrome of The Better Land , which will form the finest illustration ever   put out for Chinese homes. The Secretaries of the Christian Literature   Society in Glasgow have also sent us a fine collection of electros for   illustrating our magazines and books. The Progress of Surrounding   Nations ; Agricultural Chemistry ; the Value of the Doctrine of Immortality ;   Mrs. Foster on Persecutions in Madagascar and Christian Missions in the   South Sea, and Daily Readings also by her, have all appeared serially   in our periodicals and will be published separately. A Universal   History is being translated for our Society. Mackenzie’s Nineteenth   Century is also being translated; it will give much needed and most   valuable information regarding the latest progress of the nations of the   West.     Our Magazines.     Of the value of the Review of the limes we have had assurances from   Formosa and from Shantung in increased orders for it, and also in reprints   of some of our Articles in the Chinese Daily Papers. Of the value of   the Missionary Review we also have assurance in the fact that we had to   increase the number printed, and also in the frequent republication of   some of our Articles in other Chinese religious papers. In it we have   kept in mind the wishes of the Ladies’ Branch in Glasgow, who help   us so nobly, and have had much of its contents suited to give informa¬   tion in the department they have chosen. But as it does not cover all   the objects they have in view, we must suspend its publication for a time   in order to publish the Women and Children’s Series ) unless we obtain   more funds immediately.     Dr. Allen’s Return.     Happily Dr. Allen, who has rendered such valuable service in   editing our Magazines, has now returned from his visit to the United   States, and will resume the editorial work in connection with which he   is so well and widely known.       ## p. (#7) ##################################################  9     China’s Enormous Need of Enlightenment.     China’s losses and suffering for want of enlightenment are simply   appalling.     For want of political insight she had lost within the last 35 years   in N. E. Manchuria a country as large as France; and in the South   the tributary states of Ann am, which is now larger than France, and   Burma have passed from her control.     For lack of commercial knowledge she has 80 millions sterling less   foreign trade annually than India, she only doubles her trade during   the same time as Japan trebles hers, her tea trade rapidly declines for   want of adaptation to the changing needs of the market. Her banking   commission for transfer of money from one part of the country to   another is enormously high, and a million people are daily engaged in   the primitive way of weighing their silver and counting their cash.     For lack of economical means of transport, China fails to obtain the   enormous benefits which the West reaps from this source. Mulihall   estimates the annual gain to Europe from railways alone at no less than   1,200 millions sterling ! As the Chinese Empire is in area and popula¬   tion about the same as Europe, what she misses for want of these is   evidently immense.     For lack of scientific and engineering training the many millions   of pounds sterling which each nation in the West gains annually from   these, are not within the reach of any educated Chinamen as yet.     For lack of sound knowledge in practical philanthropy among her   very numerous religious teachers—priests and nuns—the great benefit   that might be derived from such a large number is not reaped.     The result of general ignorance on such lines as indicated is the   great poverty of the nation as a whole. While many are rich, the great   mass is in terrible poverty. The poor, again, have to pay 36 per cent,   to pawnshops, and 1U0 per cent, often in order to tide over temporary   difficulties. Thousands upon thousands collect in mat sheds at every   great city in the winter in order to attend the free soup kitchens there.   This practically amounts to slow starvation. Thus China presents such   an amount of suffering as far surpasses that of any other country. Yet   most of it might be easily removed.    ## p.

(#8) ##################################################  10     Some of the most enlightened Chinamen who read our Periodicals   regularly, see this and know some of the remedies to he applied.   Railways are now sanctioned to be worked in Tientsin : cotton factories   and steel works are introduced in Shanghai and Hankow, so that the   people of China may partake of their benefits. But the remedies are   very slow in their application, and the great bulk of even the mandarins   are not only utterly ignorant of their being the greatest sufferers on   earth, but complacently congratulate each other that they belong to the   only Celestial Empire on earth ! Few among them suspect that our   little Society possesses the knowledge by which these gigantic evils —   material, moral and spiritual—can be remedied. But we do know the   remedies, and by organized efforts we are determined to make them   known throughout every corner of this vast Empire. Some day those   who read our periodic and systematic treatment of their ills, will, in   China as elsewhere, understand our motives and bless us for our work.   Meanwhile we have the conviction that by helping the Chinese who are   in need of enlightenment, we are helping to lessen the sum total of   suffering from the face of the earth, we are opening the way for   development on all sides in every province, and greatly strengthening   the hands of all the best in the land. The grand record of history   which the Chinese possess in the past is assurance of a glorious future   for them. It is our privilege to be of service to them in this their hour   of great need, and to give them the advice of true friends.\" → [\"Peking\"/LOC, \"Moukden\"/LOC, \"Tientsin\"/LOC, \"Shensi\"/LOC, \"Nanking\"/LOC, \"Chefoo\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Glasgow\"/LOC, \"Glasgow\"/LOC, \"Madagascar\"/LOC, \"South Sea\"/LOC, \"Formosa\"/LOC, \"Shantung\"/LOC, \"Glasgow\"/LOC, \"United   States\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"N\"/LOC, \"E.\"/LOC, \"Manchuria\"/LOC, \"France\"/LOC, \"Ann am\"/LOC, \"France\"/LOC, \"Burma\"/LOC, \"India\"/LOC, \"Japan\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Europe\"/LOC, \"Europe\"/LOC, \"Chinamen\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"Tientsin\"/LOC, \"Shanghai\"/LOC, \"Hankow\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC, \"China\"/LOC]"

These registers have been carefully copied from those made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and which are also deposited with the Royal Society. They show the highest and lowest ranges within each twenty-four hours, from twelve different readings. Each month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most ready and advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register of the last two months of 1833 follows the ten months of 1854, which are all we can give up to the day of publication.

The column headed “Day's increase expresses the number of hours and minutes which the day has increased since the shortest day; and, where the column is headed “Day's decrease,” it expresses the number of hours and minutes which the day has decreased since the longest day; for example, the length of the longest day in 1853 is put down in the column “Length of day\" at 16h. 34m.; and on the 6th of July following we find that the length of the day, or the number of hours and minutes between sunrise and sunset, is set down at 16h. 24m.; hence the day has decreased 10m. since the longest day, and, accordingly, in the column “Day's decrease,” we find opposite July the 6th Oh. 10m.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON SUBJECTS OF MATHEMATICS, NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY, CHRONOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, STATISTICS, &c. I. THE PROGRESS OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE EARTH'S MOTION, BETWEEN THE TIMES OF CO- PERNICUS AND GALILEO; BEING NOTES ON THE ANTEGALILEAN COPERNICANS. Any reader of the common accounts of astronomical history might suppose that the moment Copernicus sowed the dragon's teeth, a host of armed controversialists arose from out of the ground, and proceeded to mutual slaughter. This arises from the manner in which popular writers are naturally led to pass over an intervening time, and to bring their readers at once to the story of Galileo and the Inquisition. But when it is remembered that this period of ex. citement begins with the construction of the telescope in 1609, and that the work of Copernicus was published in 1543, it will appear that there is a term of no less than 66 years during which the pro- gress of opinion is to be accounted for. That is, the contemporaries of Galileo looked back upon the announcement of the motion of the earth just as we look back upon the commencement of the first French revolution. During this term of 66 years, the question was not, properly speak- ing, discussed. Various writers gave opinions, but no book was written against another book. Some leaned towards the actual motion of the earth : some got no further than the armission of that motion as a very simple anii efficacious way of deducing the plane- tary motions. Some thought that the diurnal motion only could be maintained : others were equally in favour of the motion round the The difference between a physical and a mathematical use of the Copernican or any other theory, is one which is rather puzzling to a reader unaccustomed to such considerations. A mathematical Copernican was one who saw that, come how it might, the heavenly appearances are such as would take place if the earth did move about the sun, and also about its own axis : and that, consequently, the sun.    ## p. 6 (#106) ##############################################  6 Notes on the Antegalilean Copernicans. supposition of such motions, true or false, would be a convenient and efficacious mode of explaining and predicting celestial phenomena. A physical Copernican added to the above the belief that the reason why things appear as they would if the earth had these motions, is that it really has them. The first said that the hypothesis explains or demonstrates phenomena; the second said that the hypothesis is a true statement of the causes which produce phenomena. Every person who knows the heavenly motions, as they appear before our eyes, and has a little knowledge of geometry, must be a mathematical Copernican : he cannot fail to see that a Copernican universe would show the same appearances as that in which we live. Accordingly, from the moment when the work of Copernicus ap- peared, the beauty of the explanation was fully acknowledged, and the author took his place at once among mathematicians of the first order, both for his own novelties, and for his additions to the old system. The highest terms of praise are found in the writings of those who were most opposed to the physical truth of the hypothesis. Those who were inclined to blame the novelty of the system-for in every age the production of new opinions meets with reproach-had their mouths stopped by reference to those among the ancients who were known to have believed the actual motion of the earth. It is said that Leonardo da Vinci held the motion of the earth, as appears by his manuscripts, about 1500: but it does not appear that he constructed any system of explanations. There was a work of Calcagnini actually written and made known (divolgo, says Tiraboschi, which we suppose does not imply printing) before that of Copernicus, in which the earth's motion was defended: but as the author was known to have travelled in Poland, where Copernicus had long been teaching his system in every way except through the press, as well as for other reasons, the Italians suppose he must have had know- ledge of Copernicus and his opinions. In 1533, J. Albert Widman- stadt, afterwards known as an oriental scholar, explained the views of Copernicus before Clement VII., for which explanation that Pope presented him with a Greek manuscript, which was preserved at Monaco in the last century with an inscription by Widmanstadt recording the gift and the reason. We shall now give some detached accounts of the mode in which the system presented itself to those whom we may term its Antega- lilean supporters or opponents. The dates attached are those of death, but all the writers belong to the sixteenth century. Nicholas Copernicus (1543).—The question whether Copernicus himself was a Copernican in the modern sense of the word is not easily settled. His phraseology is almost always that of a mathema- tical Copernican (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note 8). In a very few places, and cautiously, he leans to the physical truth as probable, and to the diurnal motion as more probable than the orbital. When the Congregation of the Index, in 1620, propounded the alterations under which they could allow his book to be read as a mathematical hypothesis, they found those alterations very few in number : and, though confessedly disposed to cancel the whole of Chapter VIII., as treating of the truth of the motion of the earth, they were never- a    ## p. 7 (#107) ##############################################  Notes on the Antegalilean Copernicans. 7 theless able to allow it to stand, because the author seemed to be speaking problematically; whence they only imposed a few verbal al- terations. Riccioli (Alm. N. ii. 294) affirms Copernicus to have been a physical* Copernican, and cites the passages which, in his opinion, prove it; but he does not feel able to get farther than the qualified statement that Copernicus maintained the motion of the earth as more probable, or even as demonstrated. The reader who can com- pare the passages in the page cited with the alterations demanded by the Congregation in p. 496, will be able to judge for himself: see also the life of Copernicus in the Penny Cyclopædia. George Joachim Rheticus (1576).--This celebrated friend of Copernicus, and one of the principal instigators of his publication, was himself the first announcer of the forthcoming system, in his Narratio, &c., published in 1540_(Comp. 1853, p. 9). It may be collected from this letter that Rheticus was, more than Coper- nicus, inclined to express his belief in the motion of the earth as an absolute truth. But the passages which prove this are im- bedded in accounts of the manner in which the system explains phenomena, and it would take more space than we can give to put in evidencet the distinction between the phrases of Copernicus and those of his herald. The following paragraph, however, will show the manner in which the account struck another person. Achilles Gassarus.—His letter (Comp. Alm. 1853, p. 9, note *), written in 1540, upon receipt of a copy of the Narratio from his friend Rheticus accompanied by a very full private letter, epistola harum rerum refertissima, was printed at the head of the edition of the Narratio referred to in the note just cited. No doubt this private letter gave very explicit statement of the view actually taken by Rheticus. Delambre (Astr. Mod. vol. i. p. 138) imagines that it was the work of Copernicus himself which was sent to Gassarus ; and concludes, from copies being thus issued three years before the date of the book, that Copernicus delayed its publication even after it was printed. But this is a mistake : we know perfectly well that Copernicus never opened his own book, and received the only copy he ever saw on the very day of his death. Gassarus describes the publication of Rheticus as of novelty enough to stupefy any one, as most contrary to the doctrines of the schools, and as what the monks would certainly call heretical. He instances the motion of the earth as among the wonders, but enters into no detail, apparently because he sends on the work itself to his correspondent. We infer, then, that Rheticus was a physical Copernican. This Gassarus was the constructor of a series of almanacs, under the title of Prognosticon a a * All the writers who make a similar affirmation in the sixteenth century are op- ponents, except only Thomas Digges, who stoutly and expressly denies (in 1594) that Copernicus meant his assertions “onely as mathematical principles fayned, and not as philosophicall truely averred.” + Some give a very different account. In the Penny Cyclopædia (Rheticus), ap- parently after Zedler, it is stated that this Narratio is ahsolutely written in opposition to Copernicus,\" to show that the rotation of the earth about the sun is not a mere probable hypothesis, as Copernicus had thought fit to announce it, but an incontestable truth.\" And many writers, though not going so far as this, are yet decided in their statements that Rheticus was a physical Copernican, We arrive at the same opinion with more difficulty.    ## p. 8 (#108) ##############################################  8 Notes on the Antegalilean Copernicans. Astrologicum. That for 1546 is dedicated to Rheticus, who, says Gassarus, after the example of his master Copernicus, gave easier introduction and clearer demonstration to the celestial motions. It is probable enough that, next afier Rheticus, Gassarus was the first who ventilated the name of Copernicus in print. Erasmus Rheinhold (1553).—He was the friend of Copernicus, and an abettor of the publication ; but his view was very different from that of Rheticus. In his Prutenic (Prussian) tables, he makes use of the observations of Copernicus, and he constructs tables of the planets both on the old and on the Copernican data. He enters into no discussion, and (according to Delambre) finds no occasion to speak either of the motion of the earth or of the sun. It must be remarked that several of the early Copernicans, whatever they might think of the system physically or mathematically, found their chief source of admiration in the changes which Copernicus made in the numerical data of the planetary, and especially of the lunar, theory. These numerical data might with ease have been transplanted into the Pto- lemaic system. Rheinhold, then, so far as he declares himself, heads the school of numericai Copernicans. Peter Ramus (1572).—This celebrated leader of opinion is reckoned rather among the philosophers than the mathematicians. In the common language of our day, those who investigate matter have usurped the name of philosopher, or rather, perhaps, have had it usurped for them; while those who were once called philo- sophers * are now usually called metaphysicians. This is of no con- sequence, t except in the confusion it creates: we shall in this article use the term philosopher in its old sense. Ramus, a thorough opponent of the old philosophy, began life, when he disputed at Paris for his degree of master of arts, by offering to maintain the contrary of any assertion whatsoever of Aristotle. His writings † were censured by the University of Paris in 1543, the year in which Copernicus published his great work. He was a correspondent of Rheticus, and states (Sch, Math. book ii.) that he endeavoured by letter to per- suade him to free astronomy altogether from hypothesis; and that if Rheticus had not been obliged by circumstances to betake himself to the practice of medicine, the mathematics might have had another Copernicus to celebrate. Ramus, then, was for astronomy without hypotheses, but with a very high opinion of Copernicus and of his system as against previous ones ; so far his meaning is not very clear. Mæstlinus took him literally, as advocating merely 7 * It must, however, he observed, that mind and matter were both subjects of the ancient philosophy, physics being natural philosophy. The new school advocated experimental pliilosophy, professing to draw all their conclusions from experiment. The two terms were antagonists for some time; but at last they coalesced and for more than a century writers and teachers have talked of natural and experimental philosophy, a combination which still lingers in the prospectuses of schools and lectures. + It is impossible to keep words to their meanings. The words physician and naturalist are of the same original meaning, namely, investigators of the external world; but the first now means a person who looks after the health of men, while the second means one who looks after the classification, &c. of brutes and vegetabies. # It is a coincidence of date worth noting, with reference to the attack on the old system, that the astronomy of Copernicus and the logic of Ramus were published in the same year.\" → [\"Royal Observatory\"/BUILDING, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"Nabonassar\"/LOC, \"Tyre\"/LOC, \"Antioch\"/LOC, \"Yezdegird\"/LOC, \"Poland\"/LOC, \"Monaco\"/LOC, \"Paris\"/LOC, \"Paris\"/LOC]"

THE Thermometrical Register, showing the highest and lowest temperature of the corresponding month of the preceding year, has been resumed in the British Almanac this year at the request of numerous correspondents. These registers are copied from those made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. They show the highest and lowest ranges within each twenty-four hours, from self-registering thermometers. Each month is placed with its corresponding month, as affording the most ready and advantageous means of comparison, although by this arrangement the register of the last three months of 1870 follows the nine months of 1871, which are all that can be given up to the day of publication. Equation of Time. In this Almanac the calculations are all made for mean time (given by the clock), instead of apparent time (given by the sun-dial), which latter had been used up to the year 1833. It must be obvious that, for all practical purposes, mean time is the most useful; and to obtain it from apparent time, the columns in the Almanac headed “ Equation of Time\" should be used. The column “Equation of Time\" ought, for example, to be consulted when persons are desirous of setting their clock by a sun-dial. When clock after sun is written above the number of minutes and seconds opposite to the day, then the clock ought to be set so much slower than the sun-dial, and the contrary. Moonlight. The Moon's age is set down in days and the nearest tenths of days from the time of change. Thus it is New Moon on the 8th of April at Oh. 32m. morning, and there- fore at noon of that day she is 11h. 28m. old, which is set down as five-tenths. The fraction of the day of course continues the same throughout the lunation. See also the table showing the duration of moonlight on page 10.

AUXILIARY TABLE FOR FINDING THE TIME OF SUN- RISING AND SETTING. The time of Sunrise and Sunset in the British Almanac' is adapted to the parallel of Latitude in which London is situate-viz., 51° 30'. THE table, pages 3-4, has been constructed to show the variations of time through the United Kingdom-namely, between the latitude of 58° and 50° 10' N. The times of sun-rising and sun-setting are computed for the instant that the sun's centre is even with the horizon of the sea. The number of minutes found in this table under the month-day, and in the required latitude, are to be applied to the time of sun-rising and setting found on that day in the Almanac; the result will be the time of his rising and setting at the place required.--Ex. At what time will the sun fise and set on May 21 at Edinburgh? The times of sunrise and sunset on that day in the Almanac are 4h. lm. A.m., and 7h. 52m. P.M. In the table, in parallel of 56°, in which (p. 3) Edinburgh is found, and under May 21, are 23 minutes; which, subtracted from 4h. Im., leaves 3h. 38m. for time of sunrise; and, added to 7h. 52m., gives 8h. 15m. for time of sun-setting. But at those places where instead of mean time at place* rail- way time is now used, which in Great Britain is Greenwich mean time, and in Ireland Dublin mean time, to the times of sun-rising and sun-setting, as deduced by the aux- iliary table, the longitude in time must be applied thus:-For places in Great Britain whose longitude is west of Greenwich, to the time of sunrise or sunset add the longi- tude in time, and to places whose longitude is east of Greenwich, subtract the longitude in time, the result will be the railway or Greenwich time that the sun rises or sets.

Free education ought to be provided for a considerable number of pupils, inasmuch as experience proves that some of the most gifted musicians - are to be found among the lower ranks of society, and the fees payable by the other students ought to be very much lower than those now charged, while it would also be desirable to add a general educational establishment to the institution. In connection with it evening classes might be formed, and an orchestra might be permanently kept up for the trial of new works, thus offering to English composers an advantage the want of which has too long acted as a discouragement. Another important question is the best means of providing elementary training for the people, and especially the young in our large towns. The teaching of music in the parochial schools will do much to promote this result if, as we hope will be the case, sight-singing and not singing by ear is insisted on : but the adults and the young men and women still remain to be provided for. One point is very plain, that if musical education becomes general, there will in future be a better supply of competent teachers for the training of the children, and if the numerous school-rooms controlled by the local boards are made available for evening instruction, much may be done. Classes on the old notation and on the Tonic Sol-Fa system might be conducted on different evenings, and in nearly every case they would be found to be self-sup- porting, especially if concerts were given at intervals by the pupils. But while the poor are cared for, the higher classes must not be neglected. Music must be efficiently taught in all our large public and middle-class schools for boys; and in girls' schools, where the pianoforte has always formed a subject of in- struction, the system must be altered materially from that hitherto adopted. In the place of the dull mechanical drudgery which the pupil now passes through and which can only render her tolerably proficient as far as the mere digital exercise on the keyboard is concerned, music must be taught as other subjects are taught, and “the reason why” must form an element in the teaching In a word, the art and not the instrument must form the basis of the lesson, and the pupil in learning to play must also learn the language as well as the mere notes. The every-day conversation in our drawing rooms, and the style of music there supplied, prove that there is an immediate need of reform in this respect, and one of the most practical methods of imparting a knowledge of first principles is to bring up every child in the practice of sight-singing, as when this is satis- factorily and soundly taught, everything else will follow. Much also may be done by our composers, our concert-givers, and our artistes. Let them remember that they owe a duty to art as well as to their pockets, and as a good painter would decline to place his name on a carelessly executed picture which would    ## p. 66 (#174) #############################################  66 Industrial Results of Photography. tarnish his reputation, so let the song-writers, the conductors, and the vocalists remember that they have a very important duty to fulfil, and that they can to a great extent guide the public taste. It may be true, as we believe it is, that Englishmen lack in many cases that innate power of distinguishing the true from the false in music, which is such a striking characteristic of the Germans; but there is always a tendency to ascribe to natural inferiority that which ought more truly to be laid at the door of a defective system of training. Thoroughly convinced are we that a deep love for the art exists among the English people, and we look forward with hope to the day when it will be generally culti- vated by rich and poor. Its influence can only be for good, its practice can only tend to make men better Christians and better subjects, and he who wishes well to his country can adopt no surer method of promoting her true welfare than by aiding to the utmost of his power in this truly national work. CHARLES MACKESON. INDUSTRIAL RESULTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. ALThough the now familiar art of Photography may, to some extent, be regarded as still in its infancy, its practical influence in the realms of manufacturing industry has proved the reverse of insignificant. Forty years ago, the process of taking pictures by means of the sun's rays was regarded as little better than a beautiful scientific experiment, too costly and difficult to possess any chance of being frequently repeated. At the present time it forms the regular occupation of some thousands of individuals, not only in this country, but also on the continent, in the United States, in Canada, and in Australia ; besides affording the means of employment to yet larger numbers engaged in the many branches of manufacturing industry, which the increasing practical appli- cations of photography are continually calling into active exist- It has been estimated that at the present moment the photographic art, either directly or indirectly, provides employ- ment for at least half a million persons in various parts of the world. There are no means of verifying the correctness of this estimate, but when we reflect on the enormous extent to which photography is practised in the United States alone, where every town has its photographic studio, not to mention those of the large cities, the calculation does not seem at all excessive. The real industrial value of photography dates from the dis- covery of the collodion process in 1850. This formed the actual starting point of the art. It rendered the taking of permanent pictures comparatively easy and cheap, and caused the Daguerreo- type and Talbotype to become things of the past. In the daguerreotype process, the portraits were taken upon plates of silver, or copper coated with silver. Despite their costly character a very considerable trade arose out of the demand for these ence.    ## p. 67 (#175) #############################################  Industrial Results of Photography. 67 plates, and large numbers of persons were employed in silvering the surface of the copper, a process requiring great delicacy and care. But the leaden, death-like hue, peculiar to Daguerreo- type portraits, a defect which not even the employment of colours could wholly remove, caused a greater preference to be shown to the Talbotype, in which paper was used instead of silver. Moreover, while in the case of the Daguerreotype process the portraits were reversed, as in a looking-glass, those taken by Mr. Fox Talbot's method showed the object represented as it really appeared to the eye. This was effected by means of the picture being taken upon waxed paper, which showed the lights and shadows reversed. The picture thus obtained was called a negative. The waxed paper, or negative, was then laid upon another piece of prepared paper, and exposed to the action of light, which, passing through the transparent portions of the picture, caused them to become darkened on the second paper, the opaque portions remaining untouched. The new picture thus produced represented the lights and shadows as in nature, and was called a positive. The use of waxed paper for taking negatives has now become almost entirely superseded by the employment of glass, the surface of which is prepared especially for the purpose by one of the numerous existing modifications of the albumen, or collodion processes, according to the tastes or requirements of the photographer. În the earlier sun-pictures the want of permanency was fre- quently apparent. Not only were they costly, but they were no sooner taken than they began to fade. This was particularly noticeable in pictures produced by the Daguerreotype process, which frequently disappeared from the surface of the silvered plate, despite every precaution to protect it from injury. Nor were the Talbotype pictures much more successful. No reliance could be placed upon their stability. They might be almost perfect as pictures, but their permanency was always doubtful. They might endure for months, perhaps only for days ; but ultimately they were certain to fade. To overcome this serious obstacle long formed the great object of Mr. Fox Talbot and his fellow- labourers in the new art. The defect arose from the instability of the metallic salts employed, as explained by an experienced writer in the “Popular Science Review,\" who informs us that :- “The blacks of photographic prints on ordinary unsized paper consist of silver. To aid in the proper fixing of a photograph, or destroying its future sensitiveness to light, hyposulphate of soda in solution is employed. The action of this salt on the silver in the pores of the paper is of an extremely complex nature, and long washing is requisite to secure its removal. If not thoroughly removed, an action continues to be exerted which ultimately results in the destruction of the picture, the blacks of which are converted into a sulphide of silver. But the sulphurous gases with which the atmosphere is impregnated, joined with the complex effects produced by the albumen (with which photo- graphic paper is usully prepared), acting on the silver in a    ## p. 68 (#176) #############################################  68 Industrial Results of Photography. manner not yet clearly understood, exert a distructive influence on photography. The introduction of gold toning has mitigated this evil to a considerable extent; but an inspection of some recent pictorial productions of photographers of reputation suffices to show that it still exists, notwithstanding the known care taken by them to obviate it.” Still, the numerous improvements recently introduced into the various photographic processes have done much towards giving a permanent character to the productions of the camera. We have seen photographs, taken a few years ago, which seem as clear and fresh as when they originally left the manipulator's hands. Whether they will always remain so is a secret which time alone can reveal, but the degree of durability which can now be imparted to photographic pictures appears sufficient for all ordinary purposes. The photographic art proper is most largely employed in the production of cartes de visite and stereo- scopic views. Of the former, several millions are annually taken in this country alone. So great, indeed, is the number, that more than one Chancellor of the Exchequer is said to have considered the feasibility of materially adding to the National income, by means of a small impost on these productions of the photographer's studio. Who, in 1839, could have dreamed that the almost simultaneous discoveries of Fox Talbot and Daguerre would, within little more than a quarter of a century, not only have furnished the means of employment to many thousands of individuals, but also have suggested a new means of increas- ing the public revenue ? The popularity of the carte de visite arises from the singular clearness and sharply defined portrait characteristic of this description of photograph ; the small size of the picture employ- ing only the centre of the lens. Dr. Wynter furnishes* several interesting particulars respecting the demand for cartes de visite. He states that their sale is now scarcely a fourth of what it was when they first came into vogue. This, however, may be the case with the large metropolitan establishments, but in the provinces the rate of production appears to have suffered no decrease ; on the contrary, the number of portraits taken becomes larger each year. With regard to the sale of cartes de visite of public characters, Dr. Wynter informs us that it is still immense. Mr. Mayall, the well-known London Photo- graphic Artist, who has taken the portraits of nearly all the Royal Family, has received from Messrs. Marion, the photo- graphic picture dealers, upwards of £35,000 for cartes de visite of its various members. Indeed, the popularity of these portraits has been something wonderful. When it was known that the Princess Louise was to be wedded to the Marquis of Lorne, carte de visite portraits of the illustrious couple appeared, as if by magic, in all the photographic print shops throughout the king- dom, and speedily found their way to America and Australia. The London Stereoscopic Company sold many thousands of these * Supplement to 'Good Words,' March, 1869.    ## p. 69 (#177) #############################################  Industrial Results of Photography. 69 \" » cartes, the demand for which still exists. The portraits of favourite actresses command a very large sale, as do those of popular statesmen, but it is difficult-save in exceptional cases- to ascertain beforehand how far the carte of a new celebrity will find favour with the public. Stereoscopic views are prepared both on paper and glass, the latter, although the most expensive, being far superior, by reason of the delicacy and softness of the pictures which they afford in the stereoscope. Transparent paper views, richly coloured, also have a good sale, especially in France, where the manufacture of this description of picture seems to be better understood than in England. Stereoscopic views are divided into two classes. The first consists of representations of land- scapes, works of art, portraits, and so forth. The second class comprises what may be termed reproductions of living pictures, and illustrates the readiness with which the photographic art has been turned to account in furnishing new means of remunerative employment. Suppose, for instance, a stereoscopic view of “A Music Lesson is required. A scene is prepared, as if for a theatre; all the requisite accessories, such as pianoforte, chairs, carpets, &c., are introduced ; and the living characters, appro- priately attired, are carefully “posed.” The cost of getting up one such scene is sometimes very great, but the expense is generally covered by the sale of the pictures, as in the case of that known as “ Little Red Riding Hood,\" which became very popular. The preparation of the scenery for these stereoscopic pictures sometimes forms a distinct occupation of itself, but it is not so remunerative as it was a few years ago, when the stereo- scope was a novelty: Stereoscopic views of actual landscapes are always in demand. The list of these views is very extensive.. All the leading accessible places on the continent, in Asia, Africa, America, and Australia, have found their way into the stereoscope. We see the pyramids of Egypt, the mosques of Constantinople, the rock temples of India, the Falls of Niagara, the forests of Canada, the goldfields of Australia, the glaciers of Switzerland, the ancient cities of Italy, the lochs of Scotland, and the glens of Ireland brought before our eyes, as they actually exist. It is nature itself, and thus the educational value of Professor Wheatstone's discovery cannot be over-estimated. A few stereoscopic views of scenes in Palestine afford us a more vivid idea of the Holy Land than could be obtained from listen- ing to half a dozen lectures. The stereoscopic views, or slides, as they are more familiarly termed, are usually sold uncoloured, save in the case of representations of living pictures; these latter—as a rule—requiring a little colour, for the purpose of heightening the effect. The slides are always uniform in size, measuring 7 by 31 inches, but in France an attempt was recently made to introduce a smaller description of slide measuring 4 by 2 inches. The experiment, however, proved a failure. Photographic re-productions of celebrated pictures and en- gravings are extremely numerous, and are of every imaginable\" → [\"Royal Observatory\"/BUILDING, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"United Kingdom\"/LOC, \"United Kingdom\"/LOC, \"Scilly Islands\"/LOC, \"Falmouth\"/LOC, \"Plymouth\"/LOC, \"Portland\"/LOC, \"Portsmouth\"/LOC, \"Brighton\"/LOC, \"Dover\"/LOC, \"London\"/LOC, \"Yarmouth\"/LOC, \"Sunderland\"/LOC, \"Edinburgh\"/LOC, \"Glasgow\"/LOC, \"Liverpool\"/LOC, \"Pembroke\"/LOC, \"Holyhead\"/LOC, \"Dublin\"/LOC, \"Belfast\"/LOC, \"Galway\"/LOC, \"Cork\"/LOC, \"London\"/LOC, \"United Kingdom-namely\"/LOC, \"Edinburgh\"/LOC, \"Edinburgh\"/LOC, \"Great Britain\"/LOC, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"Ireland\"/LOC, \"Dublin\"/LOC, \"Great Britain\"/LOC, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"Greenwich\"/LOC, \"Penzance\"/LOC, \"England\"/LOC, \"Royal Academy\"/BUILDING, \"United States\"/LOC, \"Canada\"/LOC, \"Australia\"/LOC, \"United States\"/LOC, \"London\"/LOC, \"America\"/LOC, \"Australia\"/LOC, \"London\"/LOC, \"France\"/LOC, \"England\"/LOC, \"Asia\"/LOC, \"Africa\"/LOC, \"America\"/LOC, \"Australia\"/LOC, \"Egypt\"/LOC, \"Constantinople\"/LOC, \"India\"/LOC, \"Falls of Niagara\"/LOC, \"Canada\"/LOC, \"Australia\"/LOC, \"Switzerland\"/LOC, \"Italy\"/LOC, \"Scotland\"/LOC, \"Ireland\"/LOC, \"Palestine\"/LOC, \"Holy Land\"/LOC, \"France\"/LOC]"
