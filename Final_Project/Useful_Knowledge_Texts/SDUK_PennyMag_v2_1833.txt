told they were, observed, “It is a great satisfaction to

by the House of Commons for corruption in his high
office; and his own confession soon after admitted the
truth of the accusation in nearly all its force : on which
he was immediately deprived of the seals, and sentenced
to be fined, imprisoned during the King's pleasure, and
for ever excluded from parliament and all public employ-
inents. He afterwards obtained a remission of the
hardest parts of his sentence: but he only survived till
the 9th of April, 1626, on which day he died suddenly
at the Earl of Arundel's house at Highgate. Intellec-
tually considered, he was so great a man, that his cha-
racter and conduct, as an historical personage, are com-
monly, as it were by general consent, in a very singular
degree overlooked and forgotten when we mention the
name of Bacon. It is worthy of notice, as a curious
evidence of how little the delinquencies and misfortunes
of the politician, memorable as they were, were some
time after his death known or noted in those parts of the
world which were most filled with the fame of the philo-
sopher, that Bayle, in his Dictionary, published in 1695,
and again in 1702, has given us an article on Bacon, in
which he does not so much as allude to his lamentable
fall, being evidently ignorant that such an event had
ever taken place.
The method of philosophy recommended and taught
in the Novum Organon' is that of experiment and
induction. Experimenting was a favourite employment
of philosophers even in the dark ages. : The chemists
or alchemists, for instance, of those days, were conti-
nually making experiments. But their experiments

description could convey. The bones of the iguanodon
are found imbedded in sandstone, in the quarries near
6
Cuckfield in Sussex; they have also been found in
similar strata in other parts of the county. In the same
quarries are also found the bones of other large saurian
or lizard-shaped animals, together with remains of
turtles and fresh-water shells. No entire skeleton of
the iguanodon has hitherto been discovered; but Mr.
Mantell, from his knowledge of comparative anatomy,
has been enabled to trace the connection of the different
5
parts in a satisfactory manner. This was a labour
of some years ; nor was it until several of the teeth
were found that he could determine the true character
of the animal, which was an herbivorous masticating
reptile. On comparing the teeth with those of various
species of crocodiles and lizards, he discovered an iden-
tity of form with those of the living guana, as may be
seen in the annexed drawings, which are correct repre-
sentations of both. The reader may be surprised to
find the teeth of the iguanodon, which are here given of
the natural size, to be so apparently disproportionate to
the bulk of the animal, but this is the case with the
living guana; its length is five feet, but its teeth are not
larger than those of mice.
The living guana bites off the buds of vegetables, and
swallows them without mastication; but from the worn-
down state of some of the teeth, Mr. Mantell is decidedly
of opinion that the iguanodon masticated its food: such
was also the opinion of Baron Cuvier, who pronounced
this animal to be “the most extraordinary creature that
had ever been discovered." From the nature of its
food it must have been a terrestrial reptile like the
guana. The iguanodon, like one species of guana in

he was eight years old, Wolfgang composed six sonatas,

He remained in this country till July, 1765, and then
returning to the Continent, made a tour through the
principal towns of the Low Countries. After this he re-
visited Paris, and thence proceeded by the way of Lyons
and Switzerland to his native place, which he reached
in November, 1766. He remained at home, assiduously
engaged in the practice of his art, for above three years.
At length, in December 1769, he set out for Italy.
Though he had now reached his fourteenth year, the
additional skill he had acquired more than compensated
for any diminution of the wonder that had at first been
excited by his extreme youth. He was now a perfectly
accomplished musician; and his performances, being in
themselves nearly all that the most refined taste and
science could desire, required no tale of the marvellous
to set them off. After visiting Milan, Bologna, and
Florence, he reached Rome in the Passion week. Here
he performed the surprising feat of memory of taking
down, after hearing it in the Sistine chapel, the famous
Miserere of Gregorio Allegri, of which the performers
of the chapel are said to have been forbidden to give
a copy, on pain of excommunication.

The term Minster, which was used by our Saxon of religious persons forming the chapter of each of
sacestors, is a corruption of the Latin Monasterium, these establishments, and giving it the appearance of a
house tenanted by monks, or what we still call a monastic community. In this way we still speak of

is the result of some unerring instinct, or some singular
exercise of the perceptive powers, affording the most
striking objects of contemplation to a philosophic mind."
It is this accuracy of observation, combined with a
cheerful, benevolent, and pious spirit, which has at
length rendered the Natural History of Selborne a book
for all. Though its details have immediate reference to
an obscure hamlet on the borders of a barren heath in
Hampshire, the subjects of which it treats are common
to every district, and are consequently of universal in-
terest. The work, therefore, has been very properly
reprinted, within the last year or two, in several forms.
There is a cheap edition in Constable's Miscellany;
and a library edition, containing the Antiquities of Sel-
borne, some very interesting notes by naturalists of the
present day, and many well-executed wood-cuts, has just
appeared*. The wood-cuts are to our mjods extremely
pleasing. We have a view of the low-roofed hall, with
its inassive chimneys and squat gables, in which the
happy old clergymnan resided, -as well as several others
of the sequestered village, and adjacent lanes and dingles,
where he delighted to watch the movements of the birds
and insects, with whom he cultivated the most intimate
companionship. There is nothing particularly striking
in these scenes, but they are thoroughly English; and

It is difficult to select a detached passage from the
Natural History of Selborne that may give a proper
idea of the merits of this delightful book. Nor is it
necessary that we should do so; for the work itself
ought to form a part of every library, and is one
which we would especially recommend to all those who
uuite for the purchase of standard books. The notes,
however, of this new octayo edition contain many valua-
ble facts; and we shall make a few extracts from these,
which we doubt not will be gratifying to our readers.
Mr. White has an observation which might lead one
to think that the tree-frog was a noxious reptile.
Upon
this passage Professor Rennie has the following remark.
We subjoin a wood-cut of the tree-frog :-
From the way in which Mr. White speaks of the tree-
frog (Hyla vulgaris), it might be inferred that he thought
it was possessed of injurious qualities, whereas a more inno-
cent creature does not exist ; and it is besides so little, and
of so beautiful a green, that it is a very common pet in Ger-
many. My friend, J. C. Loudon, Esq., the well-known au-

These simple people give the elevated name of comedy
to the gambols of monkeys and the dancing of bears.
Besides dancing bears, these itinerants from Compiano,
Bedonia, and Bardi had dancing cocks, which we do not
remember ever to have seen with them in England, and
of late years, only rarely with them on the Continent.
The way in which they taught this courageous bird to
dance was this : They took a flag-stone surrounded by
high rims of stone or clay, or a large round earthen pan
with a flat bottom, and placed it over a small slow fire;
then, having cut or secured the cock's wings, and pro-
tected his feet and spurs by a piece of cloth on either
leg, they put him down on the confined arena from
which he could not escape, and while one man played a
lively tune on some instrument, another blew the fire
under the pan or stone. As soon as the cock felt the
heat under his feet he naturally began to lift them up;

family. The Piedmontese courier arrived at St. Ber-
nard in a very stormy season, labouring to make his
way to the little village of St. Pierre, in the valley
beneath the mountain, where his wife and children
dwelt. It was in vain that the monks attempted to
check his resolution to reach his family. They at last
gave him two guides, each of whom was accompanied
by a dog, of which one was the remarkable creature
whose services had been so valuable to mankind. De-
scending from the convent, they were in an instant over-
whelmed by two avalanches; and the same
destruction awaited the family of the poor courier, who
were toiling up the mountain in the hope to obtain some
news of their expected friend. They all perished.
A story is told of one of these dogs, who, having

on the 7th of February, 1587, and immediately informed
Mary that she must prepare for death. She heard the
announcement with courage and resignation, and asked
to have a confessor. Even this favour was not granted;
but they offered to send to her Dr. Fletcher, the Dean
of Peterborough, whom she refused to see. She then
supped, drank to her servants, who pledged her on their
knees, perused her will, adding certain bequests, and
retired to rest. Having slept some hours she awoke,
and spent the rest of the night in prayer. The morning
being come she dressed herself in a robe of black velvet,
the richest in her wardrobe, and then retired to her
oratory, where she remained till the sheriff came to
summon her to the scaffold. It was placed at the
upper end of the Hall, having set on it a chair, a
cushion, and a block covered with black cloth. Here
Fletcher began to address her in a violent invective
against her religion ; but she requested him to desist.
He then delivered a prayer; after which the executioner
prepared himself to do his office. Her women having
removed the upper part of her dress, Mary knelt down
and laid her head on the block, when the executioner at
two strokes severed it forom her body. By the testimony
of all who were present, her bearing, at this her last hour,
was in all respects becoming and magnanimous. We
ought also to have mentioned that, addressing the crowd
who stood around, she solemnly declared her innocence
both of the murder of Darnley, and of any participation
in Babington's conspiracy against the life of Elizabeth.

ADDRESS TO THE MUMMY IN BELZONI'S
EXHIBITION.
And thou hast walk'd about (how strange a story!)
In Thebes's streets three thousand years ago,
When the Memnonium was in all its glory,
And time had not begun to overthrow
Those temples, palaces, and piles stupendous,
Of which the very ruins are tremendous.
Speak! for thou long enough hast acted Dummy,
Thou hast a tongue-come let us hear its tune;
Thou’rt standing on thy legs, above ground, Mummy!
Revisiting the glimpses of the moon,
Not like thin ghosts or disembodied creatures,
But with thy bones and flesh, and limbs and features.
Tell us—for doubtless thou canst recollect,
To whom should we assign the Sphinx's fame?
By oath to tell the mysteries of thy trade ,
Then say what secret melody was hidden
In Memnon's statue which at sunrise play'd ?
Perhaps thou wert a priest—if so, my struggles
Are vain, for priestcraft never owns its juggles.
Perchance that very hand, now pinion'd fat,
Has hob-a-nobb'd with Pharaoh glass to glass ;
Or dropp'd a halfpenny in Homer's hat,
Or doft'd thine own to let Queen Dido pass;
Or held, by Solomon's own invitation,
A torch at the great Temple's dedication.
I need not ask thee, if that hand, when arm’d,
Has any Roman soldier maul'd and knuckled,
For thou wert dead, and buried, and embalm'd,
Ere Romulus and Remus had been suckled :-
Antiquity appears to have begun
Long after thy primeval race was run.
Since first thy form was in this box extended,
We have above ground seen some strange mutations ;
The Roman empire has begun and ended,
New worlds have risen—we have lost old nations,
And countless kings have into dust been humbled,
While not a fragment of thy flesh has crumbled.
Didst thou not hear the pother o'er thy head,
When the great Persian conqueror, Cambyses,
March'd armies o'er thy tomb with thundering tread,
O’erthrew Osiris, Orus, Apis, Isis,
And shook the pyramids with fear and wonder,
When the gigantic Memnon fell asunder ?
If the tomb's secrets may not be confess’d,
The nature of thy private life unfold :-
A heart has throbb'd beneath that leathern breast,
And tears adown that dusky cheek have rollid:
Have children climb'd those knees and kiss'd that face?
What was thy name and station, age and race?
Statue of flesh-immortal of the dead!
Imperishable type of evanescence !
Posthumous man, who quitt'st thy narrow bed,
And standest undecay'd within our presence,
Thou wilt hear nothing till the Judgment morning
When the great trump shall thrill thee with its warning.
Why should this worthless tegument endure,
If its undying guest be lost for ever ?
O let us keep the soul embalı'd and pure
In living virtue, that when both must sever,
Although corruption may our frame consume,
The immortal spirit in the skies may bloom.

ON THE DEATH OF A FRIEND.
Friend after friend departs;
Who hath not lost a friend ?
There is no union here of hearts
That finds not here an end ;
Were this frail world our final rest,
Living or dying none were blest.
Beyond the flight of time,-
Beyond the reign of death, -
There surely is some blessed clime
Where life is not a breath ;
Nor life's affections, transient fire,
Whose sparks fly upwards and expire.
There is a world above,
Where parting is unknown;
A long eternity of love,
Form'd for the good alone;
And faith beholds the dying, here,
Translated to that glorious sphere !
Thus star by star declines,
Till all are past away;
As morning high and higher shines,
To pure and perfect day;
Nor sink those stars in empty night,
But hide themselves in heaven's own light.

Gustavus in his royal robes, resting on the Bible, which
he caused to be translated and published at Upsal, in

of mail made of brass wire, his dagger, and his cross-

portraits of the Swedish kings of this family, and a

The large and beautiful lake of Como is principally
fed by the waters and melting snow of the neighbouring
Alps, and is almost entirely surrounded by lofty and very
steep mountains that are picturesque to the eye
rather
than productive to the poor inhabitants. In their best
parts, the superior region of these mountains offers woods
and pastures, the middle region an abundance of chesnut
trees, and the lower declivities bear vines, mulberry trees,
a few olives, and vegetables. Corn is grown in some
places, and rye in others; but frequently under circum-
stances of great difficulty, requiring infinite labour and
ingenuity. The bear, the wolf, the chamois, the white
hare, the marmot, and other wild animals are found on
these mountains; whose sides, like those of the Apen-
nines, are frequently swept by tremendous hurricanes,
which throw down the walls built to retain the soil, carry
away the earth and its produce, and destroy the labours
of years. Hard, however, as is the struggle of man with
nature, population has gone on increasing in these parts,
and the number of towns and villages is very consider-
able. Many of these, as seen from the level of the
lake, present the most striking and picturesque appear-

he was induced to resign his professorship at Padua, on
the invitation of the Grand Duke of Tuscany to accept
of the appointment of his first mathematician and philo-
sopher at Pisa. Soon after his removal thither Galileo
appears to have for the first time ventured upon openly
teaching the Copernican system of the world, of the
truth of which he had been many years before convinced.
This bold step drew down upon the great philosopher a
cruel and disgraceful persecution which terminated only
with his life. An outcry was raised by the ignorant
bigotry of the time, on the ground that in maintaining
the doctrine of the earth's motion round the sun he was
contradicting the language of Scripture, where, it was
said, the earth was constantly spoken of as at rest. The
day is gone by when it would have been necessary to
attempt any formal refutation of this absurd notion,
founded as it is upon a total misapprehension of what
the object of the Scriptures is, which are intended to teach
men morality and religion only, not mathematics or
ástronomy, and which would not have been even intelli-
gible to those to whom they were first addressed, unless
their language in regard to this and various other mat-
ters had been accommodated to the then universally pre-
vailing opinions." In Galileo's day, however, the Church
of Rome had not learned to admit this very obvious con-
sideration. In 1616 Galileo, having gone to Rome on
learning the hostility which was gathering against him,

works, and his other professional exertions, at length
brought him a sufficient sum of money to enable him to
gratify his desire of making a journey to Italy. From
that country, after having visited in succession, Florence,
Venice, Naples, and Rome, he retured to Germany in
1710, and soon after, on the invitation of several persons
of distinction in England, came over here. The recep-

country his home for the rest of his life. Queen Anne

the Great Seal. He presided in the Court of Chancery
under this title till the 22d of April, 1697, when he was
appointed Lord High Chancellor, and raised to the
peerage as Baron Somers of Evesham. The King also
bestowed upon him at the same time a grant of the
manors of Reygate and Howleigh in Surrey, worth
about £600 per annum, together with an annuity in
money of £2,100. The place which he now occupied
was no higher than that to which the most competent
judges, and indeed the public generally, had long re-
garded him as both destined and entitled. Though he
had made a regular progress," says Addison, (* Free-
holder, No. 39,) “through the several honours of the
long-robe, he was always looked upon as one who
deserved a superior station, till he arrived at the highest
dignity to which these studies could advance him."
In the parliament, however, which met in December,
1698, the party to which Lord Somers had been all his
life opposed, appeared in great and unusual strength.
It was not long before they began to direct the most
violent and persevering attacks against the Chancellor.
Of their charges, we can only afford room to state, that
they now seem to be considered, by historians of all
shades of opinion, as entirely without foundation. At the
time, however, they served the purpose of their authors
too well. After various other proceedings, on the 10th
of April, 1700, an address was moved in the House of
Commons for the dismissal of the Chancellor. It was
negatived; but King William, alarmed by the pertinacity
of the enemies of his able and honest minister, and

it was necessary to be admitted also into the community
of the business or art which he wished to follow. Some
professions however were open, such as that of banker
and agent. The Hotel de Ville then, it appears from
this statement, served, among other purposes, as a place
of deliberation for the representatives of the city of
Brussels, whenever any business of great importance
called them together. The complicated form of go-
vernment which formerly prevailed in these old cities
may be imagined from the little that we have stated
about it; and the system of privileges and restrictions
as to the free exercise of trade, whatever advantages it
may have had at first (for such things sometimes have
their rise in a really useful principle, though more fre-
quently they have rested on erroneous notions), must
have ultimately proved detrimental to these cities. The
history of Aix-la-Chapelle, with the factions and feuds of
the contending interests, is one of the most curious and
instructive that we can refer to.
And the timorous quagha's whistling neigh
Is heard by the fountain at fall of day ;
And the fleet-footed ostrich over the waste
Speeds like a horseman who travels in haste,
Hying away to the home of her rest
Where she and her mate have scooped their nest,
Far hid from the pitiless plunderer's view
In the pathless depths of the parched Karroo.
Afar in the desert I love to ride,
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side;
Away-away-in the wilderness vast,
Where the white man's foot hath never passed,
And the quivered Coranna or Bechuan
Hath rarely crossed with his roving clan:
A region of emptiness, howling and drear,
Which man hath abandoned from famine and fear;
Where grass, nor herb, nor shrub takes root,
Save poisonous thorns that pierce the foot ;
And the bitter-melon, for food and drink,
Is the pilgrim's fare by the salt-lake's brink :
A region of drought, where no river glides,
Nor rippling brook with osiered sides ;
Where reedy pool, nor palm-girt fountain,
Nor shady tree, nor cloud-capt mountain,
Is found, to refresh the aching eye:
But the barren earth, and the burning sky,
And the blank horizon, round and round,
Without a break--without a bound,
Spread-void of living sight or sound.
And here, while the night-winds round me sigh,
And the stars burn bright in the midnight sky,
As I sit apart by the desert stone,
Like Elijah at Horel's cave alone,
"A still small voice” comes through the wild
Like a father consoling his fretful child-
Which banishes bitterness, wrath, and fear,—
Saying_" MAN IS DISTANT, BUT GOD IS NEAR!"
** The above poem was written about ten years ago at the Cape
of Good Hope. It first appeared in the South African Journal'
for April 1824; and has been since reprinted, sometimes very in-
accurately, in several collections of fugitive poetry: The present
copy has been revised by the author (Mr. T. Pringle) for this
publication.
AFAR IN THE DESERT.
Afar in the desert I love to ride,
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side,
When the sorrows of life the soul o'ercast,
And, sick of the present, I turn to the past;
When the eye is suffused with regretful tears
From the fond recollections of former years,
And shadows of things that have long since fled
Flit over the brain, like ghosts of the dead ;
Bright visions of glory that vanished too soon,-
Day-dreams that (eparted ere manhood's noon,-.
Attachments by fate or by falsehood reft, -
Companions of early days lost or left;
And my native lani.- whose magical name
Thrills to the heart like electric flame,
The home of my childhood,—the haunts of my prime,-
All the passions and scenes of that rapturous time
When the feelings were young, and the world was new,
Like the fresh bowers of Eden unfolding to view;
All--all now forsaken, forgotten, foregone!
And I-a lone exile remembered of none-
My high aims abandoned, -my good acts undone,
Aweary of all that is under the sun, --
With that sadness of heart which no stranger may scan,
I Ay to the desert afar from man !
Afar in the desert I love to ride,
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side,
When the ways of the world oppress the heart,
And I'm tired of its vanity, vileness, and art;
When the wild turmoil of this wearisome life,
With its scenes of oppression, corruption, and strife,
The prond man's frown, and the base man's fear,
The scorner's laugh, and the sufferer's tear,-
And malice, and meanness, and falsehood, and folly,
Dispose me to musing and dark melancholy ;
When my hosom is full, and my thoughts are high,
And my soul is sick with the bondman's sigli
Oh! then there is freedom, and joy, and pride,
Afar in the desert alone to ride!
There is rapture to vault on the champing steed,
And to bound away with the eagle's speed,
With the death-fraught firelock in my hand-
The only law of the desert land !
Afar in the desert I love to ride,
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side ;
Away--away from the dwellings of men,
By the wild-deer's haunt, by the buffalo's glen ;
By valleys remote where the oribi plays,
Where the gnu, the gazelle, and the hartebeest graze,
And the gemsbok and eland unhunted recline
By the skirts of grey forests o’erhung with wild-vine;
Where the elephant browses at peace in his wood,
And the river-horse gambols unscared in the flood,
And the mighty rhinoceros wallows at will
In the vºley* where the wild-ass is drinking his fill.
Afar in the desert I love to ride,
With the silent bush-boy alone by my side,'
O’er the brown Karroo, where the bleating cry
Of the springbok's fawn sounds plaintively;
Where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane
As he scours with his troop o'er the desolate plain ;

Previously to showing the way of finding how much a
given sum per year will yield per day, we will make one
remark on the use to be made of the remainder in
division. When the remainder is to be thrown away, if
it be as great as half the divisor, the last figure of the
quotient should be increased by 1. Thus 97 divided by
il, which gives the quotient & and the remainder 9, or
81, should rather be written 9 than 8, when the fraction
is to be thrown away.
Again, division by 20 is the same as divis by 2,
if the quotient be removed one place more to the right
than would be the case in division by 2. Thus,

No. 1, retaining only the first figure found from the
shillings, or annexing a cipher if there be less than
two shillings, which gives 27399. Divide first by four,
then by eleven, then by twenty, repeating the successive
divisions by deren and twenty, until there is no longer
any quotient, and attending to the above remark in
disposing of the remainder. Add all the quotients as

This fund arises from voluntary donations, legacies, and the
produce of certain dues which the State assigns to it; such
as for dispensations in matters of divorce, or marriage between
relatives, &c. This is the only portion of the expense which
the State itself is called upon to contribute, and it is of very

this, there is a fund for the assistance of his widow and chil-

butions of 28. 3d. per quarter and those of his colleagues ;
to which are added 350 dollars a-year from the State and

the Superior Consistory. All the national schools are under
the superintendence of the local clergy, and the whole system
is subject to the immediate control and direction of the

cathedral, an ancient Gothic building, is more noted for
its relics and the historical associations connected with
it, than for its beauty, though it contains many objects
which will attract a visitor's attention. It is loaded with
small ornaments, which form a striking contrast with
its pillars of granite, marble, and porphyry. The chair
is still preserved in which so many German Emperors
have been crowned since the time of Charlemagne : it is
made of white marble of indifferent quality, and has no
beauty of form to recommend it." Many of the orna-

French, but restored after the downfal of Bonaparte.

the altar of the choir, and is made of white marble.

Reading ought to be united with history. The best and
first history, of course, is that of the pupil's native country,
which should be written, we need hardly say, very differently
from any book of the class yet published. A school library,
stored with useful books, might afford inestimable advan-
tages. And why should England see her labours for pro-
moting knowledge and enlightening mankind, turned to a
better account in other countries than in her own ?
To writing, i. e. calligraphy and orthography, should be
added lessons on the general principles and nature of
language.
Élementary drawing, which has been so often recom
mended, should certainly be a part of the education of all
classes. It might be confined to the slate, and consist in
teaching to draw straight and curved lines, with regular
figures, accompanied by drawings composed of these lines
and figures; and, finally, the pupil should draw various real
objects. This branch of drawing proceeded from, and is
cultivated in, Pestalozzian schools.
The copying of pattern drawings and objects of nature
must be chiefly left to the taste and opportunities of every
individual pupil. The symmetrical figures, or compositions
expressing merely symmetry-such as architectural orna-
ments, patterns of vessels, furniture, &c. need only be drawn
on slates during the lesson, and may afterwards be copied at
home into books with lead pencil, by those who show any
taste and wish for it; and their books might occasionally be
brought to school for the inspection of the master. There
is little doubt that those who, after leaving school, enter
trades may derive the greatest advantages from those lessons
of drawing, which develope and cultivate a taste for beauty
and symmetry of form. Such practice would, undoubtedly,
soon have a beneficial effect on all great branches of our
national industry, where the taste of the workman is called
into action.

Camphor has been found to exist in numerous plants
whence it may be obtained by distillation. Neumann

zedoary, thyme, sage, the inula helenium, the anemone,
the pasque flower, and some other vegetables. Experi-

an abundance of flax, possessed manufactories a short

where he thought he would enjoy superior advantages.
All the assistance that his parents could give him for any
this project amounted to a sum of about eight pounds,
and with this he set out. "But in a short time,”

we said somewhat more on the subject of organic
remains. We shall, however, limit ourselves to a few
important facts connected with the great classes of fossil
organized bodies.
We have said that shells are by far the most numerous
class of fossils: they are found in all formations, from
the lowest stratum in which animal remains have been
seen, to the most recent deposit now in progress. To
a person who has made conchology (or the science
of shells) a special object of study, there are many
striking differences between those found in a fossil
state and such as now exist in our seas, lakes, and
rivers; but were we to describe or give representations
of even remarkable fossil shells, a general reader would
discover in most of them nothing so peculiar as to
arrest his attention. There is, however, one which is
so different from any thing now living, and of such

of the secondary strata that is identical with a living
species; all are extinct. In the oldest of the tertiary
beds, some shells are found identical with living species,
and the proportion of these increases the more recent the
deposit, until at last they greatly predominate over the
extinct species in the more recent deposits. It is thus
evident that there has been an extinction of some genera
and species, and a creation of others, in a constant state
of progression, from the earliest periods of the earth's
history. In the case of fossil shells, as well as other
organic remains, a great proportion bear a strong
analogy to such as are now only known to inhabit
tropical seas.

situation and surrounding scenery. It is not only in
itself one of the finest specimens of Grecian architecture,

LINES,
[COMPOSED A FEW MILES ABOVE TINTERN ABBEY, ON REVISITING
THE BANKS OF THE WYE DURING A Tour. July 13, 1798.)
Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! and again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a sweet inland murmur*.-Once again
Do I behold these steep and loſty cliffs,
That on a wild secluded scene impress
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tuſts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
Among the woods and copses, nor disturb
The wild green landscape. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees !
With some uncertain notice, as might seem,
Of vagrant Dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.
These beauteous Forms,
Through a long absence, have not been to me
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
And passing even into my purer mind,
With tranquil restoration :-feelings too
Of uremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man's life,
His little, nameless, unremembered acts
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
To them I may have owed another gift,
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened :-that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul :
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.
If this
Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft,
In darkness, and amid the many shapes
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
O sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer thro' the woods,
How often has my spirit turned to thee !
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
With many recognitions dim and faint,
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
•The river is not affected by the tides a few miles above
Tintern,
The picture of the mind revives again :
While here I stand, not only with the sense
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
That in this moment there is life and food
For future years. And so I dare to hope,
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first'
I came among these hills; when like a roe
I bounded o'er the mou ains, by the sides
of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
Wherever nature led : more like a man
Flying from something that he dreads, than one
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,
Ànd their glad animal movements all gone by,))
To me was all in all. I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract
Haunted me like a passion : the tall rock,
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
Their colours and their forms, were then to me
An appetite-a feeling and a love,
That had no need of a remoter charm,
By thought supplied, or any interest
Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past,
And all its aching joys are now no more,
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts
Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,
Abundant recompense. For I have learned
To look on nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue. Aud I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
And the ronnd ocean and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:
A motion and a spirit, that impels
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
And rolls through all things. Therefore am Í still
A lover of the meadows and the woods,
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye and ear, both what they half create,
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise
In nature and the language of the sense,
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being.
Nor perchance,
If I were not thus taught, should I the more
Suffer my genial spirits to decay:
For thou art with me, here, upon the banks
Of this fair river; thou, my dearest Friend,
My dear, dear Friend, and in thy voice I catch
The language of my former heart, and read
My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
May I behold in thee what I was once,
My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,
Knowing that Nature never did betray
The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,
Through all the years of this our life, to lead
From joy to joy: for she can so inform
The mind that is within us, so impress
With quietness and beauty, and so feed
With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
Rash judgments, nor the speers of selfish men,
Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
The dreary intercourse of daily life,
Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb ?
Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
And let the misty mountain winds be free
To blow against thee : and, in after years,
When these wild ecstacies shall be matured
Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind
Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts

regaled with this nocturnal music for more than two
months every year.
The grand mart, however, for hemp as an article of
commerce, is Russia, where it is grown in immense
quantities and of the best quality. The principal places
of its cultivation are in the southern and western pro-
vinces bordering upon Poland, and in the provinces of
Poland which belong to Russia. - The plant even grows
wild in some parts of Russia." In Siberia and about
the river Volga it is found flourishing in natural vigour

Cossack, and Tartar women gather it in considerable
quantities in autumn, when it has shed its seed and
begins to die away. It is not, however, collected by
them for its fibres, but is used, as by some other eastern
people, as an article of food, for which it is prepared in
various ways*.

whether we expect that such designs as those which follow
can be executed or procured by the cottagers of this country,
we answer, that we trust they soon will be ; and we believe
that the first step towards this desirable end is to teach

correct habits of thinking will go hand-in-hand with com-
fortable dwellings, and convenient, neat, and elegant forms
of furniture. An approximation to equalization in know-
ledge will lead to an approximation in everything else ; for
knowledge is power, and the first use that every man makes
of it is to better his condition. Our grand object, therefore,

HYMN BEFORE SUNRISE IN THE VALE OF
CHAMOUNI.
Hast thou a charm to stay the Morning-star
In his steep course? so long he seems to pause
On thy balil, awful head, O sovran Blanc !
The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful form,
Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
How silently! Around thee, and above,
Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black,
An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it
As with a wedge! But when I look again,
It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
Thy liabitation from eternity!
O dread and silent Mount ! I gazed upon thee,
Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,
Didst vanish from my thought: entranced in prayer
I worshipp'd the Invisible alone.
Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody-
So sweet we know not we are listening to it-
Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought,
Yea, with my life and life's own secret joy:
Till the dilating soul, -enrapt, transfused,
Into the mighty vision passing-there,
As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaveu:
Awake, my soul ! not only passive praise
Thou owest-not alone these swelling tears,
Mute thanks, and secret ecstasy! Awake,
Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!
Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn!
Thou first and chief, sole Sovran of the Vale !
O, struggling with the darkness all the night,
And visited all night by troops of stars,
Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink :
Companion of the Morning-star at dawn,
Thyself earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
Co-herald !-wake, O wake, and utter praise !
Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?
Who fill'd thy countenance with rosy light?
Who made thee parent of perpetual streams ?
And you, yo five wild torrents, fiercely glad!
Who call d you forth from night and utter death,
From dark and icy caverns call d you forth,
Down those precipituus, black, jagged rocks,
For ever shattered and the same for ever?
Who gave you your invulnerable life,
Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,
Unceasing thunder and eternal foam?
And who commanded (and the silence came),
Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest?
Ye ice-falls ! ye that from the mountain's brow
Adown enormous ravines slope amain-,
Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,
And stopp'd at once amid their maddest plunge !
Motivnless torrents! silent cataracts !
Who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven,
Beneath the kren full moon ? Who bade the sun
Clothe
you
with rainbows ? Who, with living flowers
Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet ?---
God ! let the torrents, like a shout of nations,
Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, God !
God! sing, ye meadow-streams with gladsome voice!
Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!
And they, too, have a voice, yon piles of snow,
And in their perilous fall shall thunder, God!
Ye livery flowers that skirt th' eternal frost !
Ye wild goats, sporting round the eagle's nest !
Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain-storm!
Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds !
Yo signs and wonders of the element!
Utter forth God, and fill the hills with praise !
Once more, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,
Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,
Shoots downward, glittering thro' the pure serene,
Into the depth of clouds that veil thy breast
Thou too again, stupendous Mountain ! thou,
That as I raise my head, awhile bow'd low
In adoration, upward from thy base,
Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears,
Sulemnly seemest, like a vapoury cloud,
To rise before me.-Rise, O ever rise!
Rise, like a cloud of incense, from the earth!
Thou kingly spirit, throned among the hills!
Thou dread ambassador from earth to Heaven !
Great hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,
And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,
Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God!
COLERIDGE.
THE BURROWING-OWL AND PRAIRIE DOG.
[The following interesting account of the burrowing-owl is abridged
from the splendid continuation of Wilson's “ American Birds,"
by Charles Lucien Bonaparte.).
VENERABLE ruins, crumbling under the influence of time
and vicissitudes of season, are habitually associated with
our recollections of the owl ; or he is considered as the
tenant of sombre forests, whose nocturnal gloom is ren-
dered deeper and more awful by the harsh dissonance
of his voice. In poetry he has long been regarded as
the appropriate concomitant of darkness and horror.
But we are now to make the reader acquainted with an
owl to which none of these associations can belong; a
bird that, so far from seeking refuge in the ruined habi-
tations of man, fixes its residence within the earth ; and
instead of concealing itself in solitary recesses of the
forest, delights to dwell on open plains, in company with
animals remarkable for their social disposition, neatness,
and order. Instead of sailing heavily forth in the ob-
scurity of the evening or morning twilight, and then
retreating to mope away the intervening hours, our owl
enjoys the broadest glare of the noon-tide sun, and flying
rapidly along, searches for food or pleasure during the
cheerful light of day.
In the trans-Mississipian territories of the United
States, the burrowing owl resides exclusively in the
villages of the marmot or prairie dog, whose excavations
are so commodious as to render it unnecessary that our
bird should dig for himself, as he is said to do in other
parts of the world, where no burrowing animals exist
These villages are very numerous, and variable in their
extent, sometimes covering only a few acres, and at
others spreading over the surface of the country for miles
together. They are composed of slightly-elevated mounds,
having the form of a truncated cone, about two feet in
width at base, and seldom rising as high as eighteen
inches above the surface of the soil. The entrance is
placed either at the top or on the side, and the whole
mound is beaten down externally, especially at the sum
mit, resembling a much-used footpath.
From the entrance, the passage into the mound de-
scends vertically for one or two feet, and is thence con-
tinued obliquely downwards, until it terminates in an
apartment, within which the industrious marmot con:
structs, on the approach of the cold season, the comfort-
able cell for his winter's sleep. This cell, which is
composed of fine dry grass, is globular in form, with an
opening at top capable of admitting the finger; and the
whole is so firmly compacted, that it might, withont
injury, be rolled over the floor.
It is delightful, during fine weather, to see these
lively little creatures sporting about the entrance of their
burrows, which are always kept in the neatest repair,
and are often inhabited by several individuals. When
alarmed, they immediately take refuge in their sub-
terranean chambers; or, if the dreaded danger be not
immediately impending, they stand near the brink of the
entrance, bravely barking and flourishing their tails, or
else sit erect to reconnoitre the movements of the
enemy.
In all the prairie-dog villages the surrowing-owl is
seen moving briskly about, or else in smali flocks
scattered among the mounds, and at a distance it may be
mistaken for the marmot itself when sitting erect. They
manifest but little timidity, and allow themselves to be
approached sufficiently close for shooting; but if alarmed,
some or all of them soar away and settle down again at
a short distance; if further disturbed, their flight is con-
tinued until they are no longer in view, or they descend
into their dwellings, whence they are difficult to dislodge.
The burrows into which these owls have been seen tu
descend, on the plains of the river Platte, where they
are most numerous, were evidently excavated by the

its strength was again attempted to be turned against
the crown, having, in 1264, immediately after the battle
of Lewes, been attacked by the victorious Montfort, Earl
of Leicester. This celebrated person, Lambarde tells
us, " girded the city of Rochester about with a mighty
siege, and setting on fire the wooden bridge, and a
tower of timber that stood thereon, won the first gate or
ward of the castle by assault, and spoiled the church and
abbey; but being manfully resisted seven days together
by Earl Warren that was within, and hearing suddenly
of the king's coming thitherward, he prepared to meet
him in person, and left others to continue the siege, all
which were soon after put to flight by the king's army."
The last repair of the building that is recorded to
have taken place was in 1461, in the reign of Ed-
ward IV. Since then it appears to have been almost
entirely neglected, and has been allowed gradually to fall
into the ruinous state in which it now appears, though
not without the waste of time having been assisted by
active dilapidation. The ruin, which is now the pro-
perty of the Earl of Jersey, occupies a quadrangular
space of about three hundred feet in each dimension.
The north, south, and east sides had been formerly
defended by a deep ditch; but that is now filled up.

the most part, built of rough stones from Caen, bound

Britain, which have been well described by Mr. Witham.
In a bed of sandstone near Gosforth, about five miles
north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a stem was found which
measured seventy-two feet in length, four feet in width
at its lower end, from which it tapered gradually, and
was eighteen inches wide at the top. It was in a com-
pressed state, as if flattened by great incumbent pressure,
so that the above dimensions of the width are not the
true diameter of the stem. The woody structure was, in
this instance, only in part preserved, but in those places
it was converted into a siliceous or flinty petrifaction,
containing cavities lined with rock crystal; and this
petrified portion was, in one place, nearly two feet in
diameter. There were no roots attached to it, and no
branches, but there were large knots and other places
where branches appear to have been broken off. The
other instance occurred in the great freestone quarries
of Craigleith, near Edinburgh, from which the greater
part of the New Town of that city has been built, a

coal-plants resemble large reeds and canes; and bodies
which appear to be fragments of the branches and stems
of palms and other trees are of frequent occurrence.
It is a remarkable circumstance, that no remains either
of grasses or of mosses have yet been observed in the
coal-measures-plants which are not very often absent

situations; and the character of the whole fossil flora of

have been inserted in their proper places, that the pro-
cess of stereotyping commences. This process is by no
means universally applied to all printed books. Its
peculiar advantages are contined to works in very large
demand, and of which the demand is continued long
after the first publication. In the case of the · Penny
Magazine,' there is another great advantage afforded by
this process, namely, the facility of procuring several
metal copies, or plates, of each number, as we shall pre-
sently explain. In the mean time we would direct the
reader's attention to a brief account of the process of
stereotyping
The first operation is that of taking a mould from
each page of moveable types. The pages are not ar-
ranged as they would be combined in a sheet, and wedged
up together in one iron frame or chase, but each page is
put in a separate chase. It is essential that the face o!
the types should be perfectly clean and dry, and that no
particle of dirt or other substance should attach to the
bottom of the types, so as to prevent them being com-
pletely level upon the surface. The page is now placed
Casting-Box or Pot.]
upon the lower part of a moulding-frame, represented
in the following cut:-
At the bottom of the pot is a moveable plate of cast-
iron, called a floating-plate; and upon this plate, the
face of which is perfectly accurate, the mould is placed
with its face downwards. Upon the back of the mould
rests the cover of the casting-box, the inside face of whose
lid is also perfectly true. The cover is held tightly down
upon the mould by a screw, connected with two shackles,
as shown in the above cut; and also by two nippers,
belonging to the apparatus for plunging the pot into the
metal pit, as shown in the cut of the last page. This
apparatus, which is attached to a crane, is so constructed
as to swing with a perfectly horizontal motion; and the
casting-pot, with the mould, being thus suspended over
the metal pit, is gradually forced down into the molten
mass, and there kept steady by a lever and weight.
The lid of the box, it will be observed, is cut off at the
corners; and it is through these spaces that the metal
enters the box, and insinuates itself into every hollow.
When the box is plunged into the metal, a bubbling
noise is heard, which is caused by the expulsion of the
air within the box. After having remained immersed
for about ten minutes, it is steadily lifted out by the
crane, and swung to a cooling trough, in which the
under side of the box is exposed to water. Being com-

APPARATUS FOR GIVING MOTION TO THE
MACHINE.-A. The Rigger, a wheel revolving
npon a shaft which is turned by the Steam En-
gine.-B. An endless strap for transmitting the
inotion of the rigger, A, to the machine.-C.
The Dead" and " Live Riggers,” two wheels,
the former one moving freely on its axis with-
out connexion with any part of the machine,
and upon which the endless strap is slipped
when it is desirable to stop it; and the other
(the outer one) turning on a spindle, which
passes horizontally beneath the bed' of the
machine, and which carries two small cogged
wheels for communicating the motion of the
strap to all parts of the machine. The first of
these, called the driving pinion,lies immediately
alongside the dead rigger, and, by turning the
first great cogged wheel, puts the whole of the
printing cylinders, drum.s, &c., in motion. The
second, called the upright bevilled wheel, is
borne on the end of the pinion, and is situated
midway under the bed of the machine ;-this
bevilled wheel, through the intervention of an
horizontal bevilled wheel, a sliding rack, and
some other contrivances, gives to the bed or
table of the machine upon which the type
rests, a horizontal motion backwards and for-
wards.
APPARATUS FOR INKING. - D. The Ink-
ing Table. This is supplied with ink by a
vibrating roller, wbieh, as it rises, touches
another roller called the Ductor, thickly co-
vered with ink from the reservoir, against
which it is placed, and, as it touches it, carries
off by contact a portion of the viscid ink along
its whole length : it then descends, and for &
moment slightly pressing itself upon the end
of the table, leaves on it a portion of the ink
which it had previously taken from the doctor
This ink is then spread over the surface of
the table by three inking rollers, and after-
wards taken from it and distributed over the
face of the type by two or three other rollers.
APPARATUS FOR PRINTING. - E. The
Web Roller.-F. The Smoothing Roller.
G. The Entering Drum.-H. The First Im
pression Cylinder.-I. K. The First and Se
cond Paper Drums.-L. The Second Impres
Bion Cylinder.-M. A sheet of white paper
placed by the laying on-boy” on what is
called the web. From this, by a contrivance
which could not be shown in the engraving,
the sheet is caught and carried under the
smoothing roller, F, where it is closely bound
to the entering drum, G, by five endless tapes,
which then conduct it smoothly and accurately
through the following operations. It is car-
ried round the entering drum and delivered to
the first impression cylinder, H, where, in
passing under it, it receives on one side, by a
rolling pressure, the impression of the first
forms of type; it is then carried by the tæpes

duction of a Penny Magazine' would be imperfect did
we not notice the business of the Book-binder. The fold-
ing and sewing of the weekly numbers and monthly
parts which we issue furnish employment to a great
number of persons, principally women. The sheets are
delivered by the printer to various master book-binders,
in whose workshops they are made up into numbers, or
parts, or volumes. The growing demand for particular
works, of which large quantities are issued, has given
a remarkable impulse to the book-binding business of
the metropolis. That business a few years back was
chiefly divided amongst three classes ;--those who bound
books elegantly in leather,--an art which cannot be
carried to perfection without great division of labour,
and by which division the fine book-binding of London
is still unrivalled ;—those who were engaged in the
commoner binding of school-books and cheap Bibles;-
பூக்க
and those who devoted themselves to the rapid folding
and sewing of magazines, and other periodical works.
But within the last seven years the introduction of the
cheap and yet neat and substantial binding in cloth,
which was first attempted by Mr. Pickering, of Chancery
Lane, has created a new branch of business, of equal
importance to any of the previously existing branches.
By this new process that cheapness is obtained which
results from the performing any particular species of
work upon a large scale instead of in detail; and that
expedition which is a consequence of the minute division
of labour which belongs to all considerable operations,

and, as fast as they are sewed, the book-binders will be
employed in cutting the edges, glueing the back, and
