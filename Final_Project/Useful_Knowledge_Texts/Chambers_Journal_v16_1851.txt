THE
WOODS!
SATURDAY, JULY 5, 1851.
HALF a century ago there prevailed an extraordinary
mania in Scotland for planting trees. The general
bareness of the country, the want of shelter for newly-
broken up lands, and the desire for ornamenting estates,
offered a sufficient reason for going largely into arbori-
culture. But other causes conspired. Foreign timber
was heavily taxed, and wood of even ordinary kinds
was enormously expensive. Wood, therefore, as a
growing crop, was believed to be one of the best sources
of revenue to landed proprietors. Whether for these
or other reasons, planting was carried prodigious lengths
in various parts of the country, vastly to the improve-
ment of the climate, and also of general amenity.
Considerable success in a commercial sense, as is
well known, attended the efforts of the Duke of Athol
and other great planters in the north; and this very
success led to still wider enterprises. Thirty years
ago-twenty years ago-planting was taken up by the
lesser proprietors as a species of duty. It was the
fashion to plant, and everybody planted. No sooner
did a gentleman purchase an estate than he made
arrangements with nurserymen to plant his hill sides,
and these were in time duly laid out with fantastically-
shaped clumps and belts of trees. Sir Walter Scott,
on purchasing Abbotsford, went strongly into this
craze for planting; and on various occasions in his
writings-more particularly in an article in the 'Quar-
terly Review-recommended every man who had the
means and opportunity to set trees a-growing on his
property. The result, we again say, is a great addition
to the beauty of the country. Scotland has been made
quite another thing by the operations of its gentlemen
planters. We thank them for what they have done,
and hope that their example will be followed in such
situations as still stand in need of shelter and decora-
tion.
While, however, commending the generally disinte-
rested efforts of planters, the time seems to have come
when it may be inquired how their enterprises are
likely to prove profitable. One thing we distinctly
admit: shelter from plantations has greatly advanced
agriculture; and where this is the case a good and
proper end has been gained. Beauty, also, is worth
not a little. But beyond these two elements there is
reason to believe that plantations in many situations
will turn out a dead loss and cruel disappointment.
In an excellent practical treatise on planting, the
author, a planter by profession, goes into some lengthy
*The Forester. A Treatise on the Planting and Management
of Trees. By James Brown, Arniston. Blackwood: 1851.
VOL. XVI.
PRICE 1d.
statements to prove that trees, on a calculation of sixty
or a hundred years, will be an infinitely more profitable
crop than anything else, supposing that the land, for
ordinary purposes, is worth only ten shillings an acre
per annum. He mentions that in one place an acre of
land produced L.144 in sixty years from trees, while it
would have given only L.30 by renting it to a farmer.
And so on with various other calculations. It does
not escape the notice of this clever planter that the
value of wood varies according as the locality may or
may not be conveniently situated as regards a ready
market for the sale of timber. But a leading and
serious defect in his production consists in a want of
deliberate advice on this important point. Some little
acquaintanceship with trees in the way of property
induces us to supply that species of admonition which
the work in question, like most other treatises on
planting, has unfortunately omitted.
In reading accounts of Canada and other uncleared
parts of America, one is apt to be not a little sur-
prised at the valuelessness of the growing timber.
Forests of the finest tall trees are spoken of as a general
nuisance. Magnificent trees which in this country we
should look upon with respect, are viewed with detes-
tation by settlers, and are felled, dragged together in
heaps, and burned. The land, in fact, is not of any value
till the timber is got rid of. In these extensive trans-
atlantic regions trees are for the most part only of use
for firewood, or for limited local purposes. It may be
doubted whether, if taken altogether, they are worth so
much as a single farthing each. A tree four feet thick
worth no more than a farthing! A similar worthless-
ness of timber is experienced in Norway and Sweden.
Travellers in these countries speak of the finest large
trees being obtainable for a penny to threepence each-
trees which in London would probably be sold for three
or four pounds. This worthlessness of timber in Canada
and in Norway of course arises from the want of local
demand corresponding to the supply, and also the high
cost of transit to suitable foreign markets. Overplant-
ing has placed various parts of Scotland in a position,
as respects trees, analogous to Canada and Norway.
In those districts traversed by railways, or which are in
the vicinity of large towns or seaports, or that are the
centre of mining operations, wood of smaller and larger
growth can be disposed of pretty readily at paying
prices; but in situations possessing neither of these
advantages, trees of any size are barely worth the cost
of cutting down. Larch, fir, ash, elm, oak-all are
nearly alike useless-positive encumberers of the soil.
We shall, for example, take a forest situated at the
distance of about thirty miles inland from a large town.
In that length of road there are six toll-bars, and the

cartage of a load of timber occupying two days will be
not less than twenty shillings-a sum double the
freight of a ton of goods by sea from St Petersburg.
Now, when to this expense of land-carriage are added
all other charges-planting, rearing, fencing, thinning,
and cutting, with rent of land for a series of years-a
price per load is made up which cannot in the circum-
stances be realised. A few well-grown and peculiar
trees may be made to pay; but we are speaking of
hundreds of acres of trees, not small quantities of a
highly-recommendable quality. In short, the landowner
who has a forest on his hands, and is cut off from the
world by half-a-dozen toll-bars, may almost as well
have as much extent of bare rock so far as direct profit
is concerned.
That facts of this nature are beginning to be pain-
fully felt by the sons and grandsons of many great
planters there can be little doubt. The hallucination
of covering lands with an unsaleable article is in the
course of explosion, much to the distress of families
who had reckoned on a different result. To aggravate
the hardship of extensive tree-owners, ploughs, harrows,
and some other agricultural implements which were
formerly made of native hardwood, are now constructed
of iron; so that, in the situations to which we refer, an
ash or elm tree, unless of vast age and size, is probably
of no more worth than one of fir or larch. Larches of
moderate size for what are called 'country purposes'—
that is, for making palings or hurdles are indeed the
only things saleable, but at prices which it seems a
burlesque to mention.
In the course of last summer it was our fortune to
cut down and try to sell sixty thousand trees in order
to thin certain woods. Larches, Scots firs, and oaks
were those principally cut. All were about twenty-
five years' growth, and generally they were about the
thickness of a man's leg; some smaller, where they
had been too crowded. The larches were cut and peeled
by contract for 278. per 1000, and the Scots firs were
cut for 15s. per 1000. The cost of cutting the sixty
thousand was L.63, 38.; and adding the charges for
cartage, and all other expenses, the entire outlay was
L.79, 5s.
How to dispose of the great loads of trees that lay
scattered about among the woods was now the difficulty.
There the fallen timber lay; and as we looked at the
unconscious heaps of trees that lately bloomed in all
their leafy honours, we felt as if we had done a cruel
thing. However, the question was now how to sell
these murdered innocents. Our factor, a shrewd man
of business-every laird, great and small, must have
his factor-recommended an auction. 'Roup them,'
said he; public competition is the thing.' Accordingly,
on a day in June, a roup was called by means of bills
on every kirk door within a sphere of ten miles; post
letters were despatched to farmers; and in the nearest
burgh town the roup was announced by tuck of drum.
The great day came, and with it a crowd of some thirty
to forty persons at an appointed place among the woods.
As we advanced to the spot the scene that presented
itself was picturesque and original. Men in gray plaids
were seated on mossy banks talking gravely of country
matters; here and there lay a shepherd with his dog;
two or three rural carpenters were inspecting the lots;
and the factor's clerk, with book and pen in hand, and
an inkhorn at his buttonhole, stood ready for business.
At our approach the auctioneer, a tall, aged carle, who
had gone through hundreds of things of the kind,
called out that the roup was going to begin; and to
shew that time was up, he appealed confidently to a
silver watch as thick as a moderate-sized turnip.
All gathered themselves slowly to their legs; two or
three mouths interchanged stumpy tobacco-pipes, and
several noses took snuff. There was a general screwing
up to business. At this important crisis, the auctioneer
winked, as a signal for us to have a private word with
him.

Speaking low: 'Have you got the whisky?' said he.
'What whisky?'

Why the whisky for the drams to be sure! Unless
'Never heard of such a thing,' said we; the people
come to buy wood, not to drink,'
'Well, well, do as you like,' replied the rustic Nestor;
only I can tell you this, that unless they are primed
they wont fire. Many of them want to buy, but they
have not got their blood up; and unless they have a
little spirits to warm them, they will hardly be brought
to give a bode. I ken the lads doon hereaway fine.'
A pretty fix this! We must either make the people
half-tipsy, or see the loads of timber remain undisposed
of.
To cut the difficulty, the onus of the transaction was
thrown on the factor. He might do as he liked. The
factor judged it prudent to supply refreshment;' some
of the audience had come ten miles, and were a good
deal tired-it was such a warm day, &c. A gilly was
despatched for a few bottles of spirits and a batch of
biscuits. The intelligence, loudly announced,
refreshments were coming, acted like magic.

There was a murmur of approbation, and half-a-crown
was twice bidden. Going to be a brisk sale,' whis-
pered the auctioneer to us encouragingly, One lot
after another was knocked down; and if little money
was going, there was no deficiency of jokes.
Aih, Charlie, that's a capital lot; ye'll hac nae
want o' parritch sticks.'
'I wadna wonder, Tam, but ye're gaun to set up
as a grand timber-merchant; there will be nae speaking
to ye.'
'Come, Sandie,' cried the auctioneer, 'here's a lot
for you; what d'ye say-a shilling to begin with ??
Sandie mustered courage to bid a shilling.
'I'll gie ye a ha'penny mair,' said a smart little man.
'Houts,' said the auctioneer, laughing heartily, keep
that for the brode* the morn. We canna take a bode
under a penny!'
From heap to heap the company straggled on,
ascending the hill, and pausing ever and anon to
chat, laugh, snuff, and do a little in the way of pur-
chasing. At length having come to a steep part of
the road, which was cut roughly through the woods,
a discussion broke out on a matter of serious con-
cern. Amidst the murmur of voices that reached us
through the trees, one was heard louder than the rest:
I'll no buy another bawbee's worth unless you lend
me the slype.'
Weel, weel, Charlie,' replied the old auctioneer
soothingly, 'ye'll get the slype, I'se warrant. Where
is he himsel'?'
Perceiving that we were in request, we made our
appearance.
Will ye lend the slype?'
The slype!-what's the slype ?'
The slype! no to ken the slype, and you have
got such a gude ane too!'
'Then be so good as explain what it is.'
'Losh, sir, no to understand what a slype is!'
There were looks of extreme surprise all round. We

rance of woodland affairs. The factor, as in duty
bound, came to the rescue.

continued cost of these fine woods to be realised?
Thirty miles from a market! Six toll bars! No
sophistry, no poetry can get over these hard truths.
Far beyond the legitimate demands for shelter and
ornament, these pleasant woods, the pride of the wild,
are valueless-a miserable consequence of that impru-
dent taste for planting which a number of years ago

offices: shall I promise the loan of it?'
By all means.'
Pacified respecting the slype, the sale went on, and
came to a finish when still a good way from the top of
the hill.
'A capital day's work this, sir,' said the auctioneer
as we walked home part of the way with him. "The
clerk tells me the sales will come to at least twenty
pound, and a' as gude as paid!'
Thereabouts, certainly, was the sum-total. There
were one hundred and seventeen lots disposed of,
consisting, in the aggregate, of twenty-three thousand
trees, cut and ready for putting on cart or slype.
After paying all expenses, the auction hardly realised
the outlay. But the history of the affair is not ended.
Despite the strong temptation of sixpence per pound
discount, many of the lots were never claimed. The
sale took place in the middle of June, and at Christmas
the snow fell on various unremoved masses of timber
a melancholy exhibition. Of course, there might have
been legal prosecution. But who would worry him-
self about such a trifle? The result, one way and
another, satisfied the sentiment. Any more sales of
wood by auction was out of the question; and the
remainder of the lots were disposed of privately, some
in barter, and others for money. The creditor side of
the account was considered by the neighbourhood as
exceedingly favourable. It shewed for sale of wood and
bark L.104, 14s. 6d. ; leaving a balance over outlay of
L.25, 9s. 6d., besides a lot of trees retained for home
use.
J
'You may think yourself well off,' said every one.
"A penny a piece is considered a good price for trees
in this quarter; and if you clear the expense of cutting
them down and removing them, it is reckoned a great
matter.
A great matter certainly! Our eyes were opened
to the grandeur of arboriculture. As many trees as a
horse could draw on a cart were sold for eighteen-
pence, though, to do the transaction justice, some
cartloads brought as high as half-a-crown and three
shillings. The whole affair was amusingly absurd, and
presented a fine instance of the fiddle-faddlery in which
country gentlemen usually busy themselves. To see
how far the joke might be carried, we invited a coun-
try carpenter, who wanted some good firs, to inspect a
lot of upwards of forty years' growth. Capital tall
sticks they were-not your thinnings. The offer which
this judicious artisan made for them was-threepence
to sixpence each. Had he cleared the two acres of
land which they covered, we should probably have
pocketed somewhere under thirty shillings. Why,
you do not mean to say that threepence is all the worth
of that tree?'
C
Yes, I do,' replied the dealer in timber; there is
little demand for wood of that kind here, and so much
of it can be had that the prices going are a mere trifle.'
Exit carpenter, and no sales.
Such are the experiences of a tree-owner, who should
be glad to know what he is to do with a hundred and
twenty acres of as 'fine thriving timber' as ever graced
an advertisement, or formed the subject of eulogy of a
reporter on plantations. There are the trees, green,
beautiful, the embellishment of the landscape. Grow-
ing and growing, year by year they are seen adding to
their bulk, towering on the hill-sides, and offering a
choice of solitary walks, deliciously fragrant and cool
in the summer heats. But how is the primary and
THE BARONESS PAFFZ.
We found ourselves doomed to the unpleasant task of
lodging-hunting at a peculiarly unpropitious season for
those who desired to combine economy with comfort
and respectability; the monster Exhibition having
extended its influence even to the quiet, far-away regions
of Bloomsbury. The notifications of Apartments to
let' in the windows of houses in the almost grass-grown
streets of that once-fashionable locality far exceeded
any number within the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant;' evincing how the anticipations of a harvest of
unusual profit, arising from the expected influx of
visitors to the metropolis, had contagiously spread. In
the course of our progress we turned down a short
blind street, where the houses were few, of moderate
size, and more cheering outward aspect than the larger
and dingier mansions of the immediate neighbourhood.
We singled out one whose windows looked bright and
clean, and where the announcement of accommodation
was displayed on a small card in very minute characters
-so minute as scarcely to be decipherable, and causing
us to hesitate before making application at the door
with the usual question, Can we view the apartments?'
However, our doubts were speedily dispersed by a
neat young handmaiden, who replied to our timid
summons with considerable alacrity, inviting us to
walk in, and to walk up to the first floor. This we did,
and found ourselves in what was of course denominated
the drawing-room-and what a tale we read by scru-
tinising the contents of the room! I turned over these
sad pages of reality, which interested me much, for I
saw we were in the abode of faded gentility, and not in
a regular lodging-house. There was scant antiquo fur-
niture, preserved with the utmost care and scrupulous
cleanliness; touching attempts at decoration and em-
bellishment; fine muslin curtains, so exquisitely darned
that the darning stood in the stead of embroidery; and
all presided over by an air of poverty indescribable,
which made one shiver and feel cold at the bare idea of
becoming an inmate. Ancient annuals were arranged
methodically on a far more ancient table, and in the
midst stood a splendid china bowl, evidently the pride
and glory of the house. It was indeed a beautiful
thing, while a solitary card reposed in its depths; and
shall I confess that we had the curiosity and imperti-
nence to peep at this bit of pasteboard? It had been
so often cleaned with India-rubber that the printing
was beginning to be obliterated; but still fairly dis-
tinguishable were the letters which formed the words-
Sir Thomas Crumpton, Crumpton Court.'
"
I had just returned this honoured relic to its painted
nest, when an individual rapidly entered the apartment,
talking in an equally rapid, excited manner, without
once stopping to take breath, and requesting us to step
down to the dining-room, where aunt was, and also a
fire.' The individual alluded to, whose quick motions
we now followed down the stairs we had so lately
ascended, was a small-sized female, apparently about
fifty years of age. She had remarkably fine dark eyes;
but otherwise the pinched, meagre, not to say starved
expression of her countenance, was absolutely painful
to contemplate. Her dress was formed after the obso-
lete mode, when waists were just under the arm-pits,
and four breadths of silk were reckoned the allowance

for a full, handsome skirt! But her headgear-what
words may describe that?, What fashion, what country,
what age, did it belong to? She wore no covering
save her own hair-and but few gray ones were percep-
tible-but that was all braided on the crown of the
head, to resemble a basket containing flowers-artificial
flowers of foreign and antique manufacture. The
flowers were faded; the dress was darned, like the cur-
tains; the gloves were mended--oh! so well and beau-
tifully mended!—and yet the little, odd lady looked like
a gentlewoman, and we felt convinced was one to all
intents and purposes. She chattered without ceasing
in the easiest, most confidential way, and introduced
us to her aunt as if we had been familiar acquaintances
instead of strangers seeking for London lodgings. The
aunt was twin-sister in appearance to the niece, not
withstanding a score or so of years' seniority; the
dining-room was twin-ghost of the drawing-room, save
that there was no china bowl; but to make up for the
deficiency, a spinet-surely the first of the spinets-
stood in one corner: it was open, too, as if recently
played upon; and, a mere handful of coal smouldered
in the brightly-polished grate, originally of moderate
dimensions, but confined into a handbreadth space
by false back and sides. They wanted society; we
were the very parties they desired to have-flattering
and embarrassing to us they had never let lodgings
before of that we felt sure but seeing so many
others put up bills, and people of high respectability,
too, they thought that, just by way of a little variety,
they, too, would try their luck at letting part of their
house-a house they had occupied for nearly thirty
years. Aunt and niece spoke both at the same time;
and to our half-uttered sentence: We fear the apart-
ments will not suit us,' exclaimed in chorus: We shall
be delighted to receive you; we do not doubt your
giving us unexceptionable references; pray do not
apologise.' And we had some difficulty in making the
poor old souls comprehend that we must search farther
before coming to a decision; but when they named an
exorbitant sum for even handsome rooms in a good
situation, and named it, too, as a nominal rent, in the
simplicity of their hearts-for the sake of being be-
neath an unexceptionable roof,' exchanging a rather
mysterious glance, we thought it better to plead imabi-
lity to meet it than to wound their feelings. But it
would not do they had taken a fancy to us, it was
clear, and, for the sake of such pleasant company,
would meet us in any way! Aunt and niece whis-
pered together for a few moments; and then the elder
lady, drawing herself up majestically, said, with an air
of dignity and importance that was never surpassed:
'Sir Thomas Crumpton of Crumpton Court is a rela-
tive, though a distant one, of ours, and I am the Baro-
ness Paffz; though, since I lost my husband thirty
years ago, and left a magnificent west-end, mansion to
reside here and bring up my orphan niece, I have
dropped my proper title, and am recognised by the
humble and commonplace one distinguishing the mass,
even as plain Mrs Paffz.'
We bowed to the baroness, and really endeavoured
to throw all the respect we could into our demeanour,
for we had no inclination to laugh, or to hold up
to derision the antiquated gentlewomen, who took our
respectability on trust, and so unintentionally flattered
our self-respect by their perfect confidence. We could
not get away from them—we must see the bedrooms,
Alas! for winter weather with those shreds of blankets,
curtains, and carpets! We must test the powers of the
'instrument,' once so famed. They doted on music,
and it should always be at our command. Then they
told us how they had lived here for thirty years-
thirty long years-visiting no one, and being visited by
nobody-(yes; Sir Thomas Crumpton had called upon
them once!)-seeing no sights save the high wall
opposite, over which the apple blossoms towered now,

but hadn't when they first came: never walking out
save to church-they were bad walkers; no books, no
papers; only this old spinet to enliven their solitary,
monotonous lives. They never hinted at poverty or
privation, though the baroness sighed when she spoke
of former splendours. At length we made our escape,
though only by promising to call again, and give our
final answer, Which we do hope-oh, so much!—may
be in the affirmative!' exclaimed both aunt and niece,
as we warmly shook hands, and parted like old friends.
The great wonder to us was, how they had ever brought.
their minds to let lodgings; but as our acquaintance
ripened, the facts of the case became more fully
divulged.
་
The Baroness Paffz, in the days of her prosperity,
had undertaken the sole charge of a destitute orphan
nephew and niece, when she suddenly found herself a
widow in reduced circumstances (the Baron Pafiz held
a diplomatic appointment, and lived up to his income.)
Her nephew Desmond at that time was still at Harrow.
school. He was a high-spirited, handsome lad, equally
the darling of his sister Clarissa and his fond aunt.
Sir Thomas Crumpton was the only influential relative
they had; but when reverse of circumstances over-
took them, he looked coldly on those whose friendship
he had formerly courted. However, he appropriated:
one of his, freehold houses, at a low rent, for the use of
the baroness and her niece: she would accept nothing
more; nor was she aware, as we afterwards found,
that twenty pounds a year were remitted by the
niggardly baronet on the rent. He also articled Des-
mond to a lawyer; and Desmond brought home every
day to the blind, dull street his bright anticipa
tions, and a spirit pining for freedom. Poor fellow ! it
could not last; he could not endure the confinement
and monotony of such an existence, for he had been a
pampered, spoiled boy, and promised by the deceased
baron a commission in the Guards!
T
He at length disappeared; and months of torturing
suspense passed over, the two lone women hearing.
nothing of his fate. They thought not of his sel-
fishness in thus deserting them; they only pitied
and loved him the more. Sir Thomas Crumpton
was indignant in the extreme at young Desmond's
conduct, and took this opportunity of "washing
his hands of his poor connections. At length a let-
ter came from the truant, and with trembling hands
and streaming eyes the sister and aunt thankfully
received it. Desmond was in India; he had worked
his way thither on shipboard, and his prospects were
brightening, after intense suffering and privation.
Another letter, and another, each more hopeful and
cheering than the last: Desmond was in the high road
to fame and fortune, and in a few years would return
to them a rich nabob! Fond dreams-illusive antici-
pations! The letters ceased, they heard no more, and
for twenty-three years these patient souls had existed
on hope. Desmond must be still alive.' No tidings
could they gather of his death in those distant regions;
still he would return to them, wealthy and powerful-
for what were twenty-three years after all? Clarissa
was still a girl to Aunt Paflz, and the baroness lived
on memories of past happiness. Changes went on
around them, but there was no change in them. A
room was kept in constant readiness for Desmond's
return, but the moth and decay will make themselves
heard; and how fervently they wished for means to
redecorate that chamber. The same idea had struck
them both, though it was a long while ere they found
courage to communicate it to each other-the idea of
imitating the example of their neighbours, and putting
up a bill signifying that part of their house was to let.
The Baroness Paffz was the landlady, Sir Thomas
Crumpton was their relative, and select and aristo-
cratic must be the inmates they received! The emolu-
ment arising from this proceeding was to be entirely

devoted to the reparation and embellishment of Des-
mond's chamber-Desmond, the anxiously and daily
looked for!
Clarissa still warbles the songs which Desmond
admired when he was a boy, for he will like to hear
them again, she says; she wears the headdress in
which then, he proudly said, his pretty darling sister
looked still prettier. Each knock at the door causes
her to dart to the window and peep through the blinds
to ascertain who it is; and often she says to Aunt
Paffz, that she almost trusts their boy may not come
just at this juncture, as he mightn't like to see the
ticket up, and she would like to have his room fresh
and nicely done up for him.
Poor things! my heart throbs in sympathy as I listen
to their oft-repeated anticipations, for we are great
friends, and I often refresh myself by going to see these
out-of-the-world women. In their case, hope deferred
has not made the heart sick --not unhealthy, or
feverish, or even impatient. They are inured to wait
ing; they literally feed on hope; and when it is with
drawn, they will speedily fade and wither doubtless,
But will it ever be withdrawn? Will they not depart
this life with the hope yet warm in their yearning
hearts that Desmond and they are surely about to
meet again? It has sustained and cheered them in
adversity, and who would wish to destroy the innocent
hallucination? It is not, indeed, impossible - such
things have been heard of and Desmond, after a
twenty-three years' silence, may turn up! We have
never regretted our labours of lodging-hunting, since
they brought us into contact with these interesting old
ladies; no other visitors penetrated so far as the retired
street where they reside; and after a few weeks they
decided on taking the modest card of apartments to
let' from the casement, lest Desmond should return.
When he does, we will promise to add a little supple-
ment to this romance of real life; and, in the meantime,
may we, under hopes deferred, prove as patient, faith-
ful, and resigned!

It will be a splendid building, no doubt, when
finished,' said M. Vieux temps, when at the appointed
time we met in New Palace Yard. A fitter residence
for monarchs than to echo the boisterous clamours of a
turbulent démocracy. The façade on the river side,
which I have seen, is very beautiful, and, I am told,

is certainly a splendidly-enriched edifice,' theo
And the cost already incurred "is, I understand,
enormous,' said Herr von Blunderblast; nearly two
millions and a half sterling-a fabulous sum to any
but English 'apprehensions.'
When one reflects upon the gorgeous character and
costly decorations of the building, both within and
without; that it stands upon a bed of concrete fifteen
feet thick, and covers nine acres of ground; that one
of its massive towers, the Victoria, will reach a height
of three hundred and forty-six feet, the two others not
much less; that the octagon court or central hall alone
contains two hundred and fifty tons of stone, fashioned
into one roof-surprise at the magnitude of the bill of
costs vanishes at once.'

temps, a French gentleman standing near the Crystalwell adapted for a cathedral, for a temple dedicated to
Palace on the 1st of May, as soon as the subsidence of
the cheers which greeted the Queen permitted him to
be heard. "I am told-and I can readily believe it
that there are a million of human beings in and about
this glorious park, and among them exiles, refugees,
visitors of every nation and degree, and yet there are
certainly not more than three or four hundred soldiers
to be seen! Where shall I find the secret of this mul-
titudinous homogenity this grave enthusiasm this
order without force this freedom without licence
this antique, hearty, but unservile loyalty where seek
the mot d'enigme of this marvellous riddle?”
As I happened to be one of a small group thus indi-
rectly addressed, I said: 'You must not forget, Monsieur
Vieuxtemps, that there is a reverse side to this gay
picture-profound shadows, but the gloomier for the
brilliant lights with which they are contrasted. In yon
vast, half-deserted city, which has poured forth this
multitude of well-dressed holiday-makers, there are
hundreds of wretched homes and pining hearts'-
'Of course
of course,' broke in the impatient
Frenchman; that must be the case, I imagine, in all
competitive societies; and the only question appears to
me to be---whether struggle, which is the life of a people,
should, because of the frequent injustices which grow
out of it, be exchanged for inert languor-moral death?
But it was not of this I was either speaking or thinking.
I am sorry to say I must agree with you. The
edifice is certainly not only in a wrong style of art, but
is invested with a frippery in the way of ornament that
is very toy-like and unsatisfactory. However, never
mind the outside. Let us walk on. Now, we are in
Westminster Hall, deeply interesting from historical
circumstances. But let us hasten through it. We are
now near the object of our search. Yon new and as
yet unfinished archway at the further end of the Hall
will form a portion of the lobby and entrance to the
new Houses of Parliament; those doors on our right
lead, as the letters on them indicate, to the supreme
courts of law and equity. It is right, in pursuance of
the task I have undertaken, that we should glance
through them, for there can be no question that to the
high character of the presiding judges, their perfect
independence of the crown, the firm and impartial
manner in which justice-costly, it is true, but still
justice--is administered by them, under the check of
freely-challengeable juries-the great writs of habeas
corpus, mandamus, quo warranto, prohibition, with
which they are armed-have greatly aided to produce
that feeling of entire security, of individual right,

country would never have reached their present
development.'
'What odd costumes! The judges and counsel look
like medieval portraits just stepped out of their
picture-frames.'
'Yes: this wig-and-gown costume always suggests a
sensation of the ludicrous to strangers; but John Bull
a man half made up of habits, precedents, and
traditions-is not one to discard a custom of anti-
quity merely because it may appear odd and out of
place.'
These high functionaries are doubtless of noble
family and descent,' remarked Herr von Blunderblast
sententiously, "The English aristocracy are well-
known to monopolise all dignities.'
'Not certainly in our courts of justice. Almost all
our legal dignitaries have risen from the middle classes.
The law in this country is a laborious and exhausting
profession, and men are seldom urged to the exertions
it exacts save by the sharp spur of necessity. The
chief-justice in this court-Lord Campbell, a peer of
parliament is a Scotch gentleman who owes the
eminence to which he has attained entirely to his legal
acumen, unconquerable industry, and vast general
talent. It is but a few years since he boasted to his
Scottish constituents that he was still "plain Jolin
Campbell." The chief-baron of this next court-the
Exchequer of Pleas-is a relative of the General
Pollock, a soldier of fortune, whose Indian exploits you
may have heard of. On his right sits Baron Parke,
perhaps the ablest legist this country can boast of.
The Common Pleas need not detain us-it is but a
reflex of the others; nor this Vice-Chancellor Bruce's
court-unless it be to remark, en passant, how difficult it
is to believe, in the presence of the courteous gentleman
and distinguished judge who presides, that Chancery
can be the hateful and ruinous thing it is,'
'Vraiment!' observed M. Vieuxtemps. The tear-
ing claw of equity does appear to be concealed beneath
a smooth and very beautiful exterior.'
"This is the Lord High Chancellor's Court. You
observe the judge?'
'Yes: a square-headed, decisive-looking man-his
cerebral organisation indicative of indomitable energy
and keen analytical thought.'
That is Lord High Chancellor Truro, who began
life as an attorney. He is now at the head of the
administration of the law in this country, and, after
the princes of the blood-royal, the first subject in the
realm.'
That appears to justify,' said M. Vieuxtemps, 'a
remark I read some time ago in a speech of the British
prime minister, which puzzled me a good deal at the
time. It was to the effect that in continental countries
the aristocracy is the despair, but in Engiand the hope
of talent.'
'A catching sentence, my dear sir, but to be taken
with reservations, Talent in this country, with the
exception of forensic, parliamentary, or military talent,
has slight chance, I believe, of the peerage. But here
we are in Westminster Hall again, and it is now quite
time we were on our way to the committee-rooms of
parliament. They are completed; but the present
temporary entrance is in Abingdon Street, nearly
opposite Westminster Abbey gate. We can go through
by this last door on the right of the Hall.'
We soon reached the small archway in Abingdon
Street, strode along the wooden passage, and ascending
the seemingly interminable stairs, at last reached the
long and splendid corridor in which the committee-
rooms of both Houses are situated. Many of the doors
were labelled with the titles of the committees, all of
the Commons House, sitting within.
'Who appoints these committees, and what are their
functions?' asked Herr von Blunderblast.
"They consist of a varying number of members
nominated by the House, to inquire into and report
upon the merits or demerits, teclinical and substantial,
of private bills, which are usually passed or rejected
according to their report; to decide upon petitions
allegative of the undue return of members; and, in
short, to inquire into and report upon all matters rela-
tive to the administration of the home, foreign, colonial,
and financial affairs of the country which the House
may choose to investigate. The House also deputes to
them its own power of sending for "persons, papers,
and records."'
'Do you mean to say,' exclaimed Herr von Blunder-
blast, that these House of Commons Committees can
compel ministers, diplomatists, field-marshals, generals,
to attend and answer questions relative to the affairs
and secrets of their departments?'
'Certainly I do. There was a committee last year
sitting to examine into the administration of affairs at
Ceylon, and they have published a large " blue book,"
containing the result of their inquisition. Another is
now occupied in investigating the conduct which the
government have pursued towards the Cape of Good
Hope. But look at the labels on the doors. What do
you read?'
'Law of Mortmain; Copyhold Enfranchisement Bill;
County-rate Expenditure Bill; Law of Partnership;
Customs; Ordnance Survey (Scotland); Great Central
Gas Company- Why, all the affairs of the country
appear to be regulated by this omnipotent House of
Commons!'
That is strictly the case. The business of the Com-
mons has immensely increased of late years. One
reason of this is, that in the Commons must originate
all money bills-all bills levying rates upon the people
for any purpose whatever; the Peers neither having
the power to initiate or change such bills in the slightest
degree; they must be either consented to or rejected en
bloc. This practice necessarily results from the consti-
tutional axiom, acquiesced in by the Lords after many
struggles to avoid so great a surrender of practical
power, that the Commons are the "granting," the Lords
the "assenting" power. In 1671 the Commons passed
a resolution that in them alone lay "the fundamental
right" in the matter of taxes and supplies “the
measure and the time." There is no professional man
who works harder during the session than an active
member of the House of Commons.'
'What do they get for all this worry and work?'
asked M. Vieuxtemps.
•
Honour and distinction-nought else. The honour
and distinction of writing M. P. after their names.'
'I shall never comprehend this money-grubbing,
money-contemning, queen-shouting, freedom-loving
people,' murmured Herr von Blunderblast, as long as
I live-never!'
"This is No. 4 Committee-room. Let us go in; but
mind you speak in whispers only when in presence of
a fragment of the Honourable House.'
'Those everlasting horse-hair wigs again!' ejaculated
M. Vieuxtemps.
'Those two gentlemen are counsel learned in the
law, who appear for the supporters and opponents of
the measure now under investigation.'
"What is the measure?'
'It is a private bill that has been petitioned for,
and of no kind of interest. Let us rather go into this
apartment, where a committee is sitting on a case of
election bribery. You will perhaps be amused: the
grief and shame belong to us alone.'
'Oh, par exemple !' exclaimed M. Vieuxtemps when,
after about an hour's attendance in the crowded room,
we once more stood in the corridor. 'But this is
scandalous.'
"The practice of bribery is a foul blot upon our
electoral system; but, except in the spread of education,
I know not where an efficient remedy is to be found.'

'But the thing is childish and absurd. Here it is
proved that needy electors receive a stipulated amount
of gold from a person whose name is given; they
are also seen swilling beer and spirits; they vote for a
particular candidate; and yet the lawyers-the com-
mittee-declare that they have no idea, no legal idea,
of where the money and the drink came from!'
"A very proper decision in the absence of legal
proof.'

plain straight rows of benches just rising one above the
other, worn green leathern seat-cushions, and wooden
galleries supported by rude square posts!'
'These are fittings erected since the fire, which you
no doubt heard or read of; and as the new House will
soon be completed, it has not been thought worth while
to incur any great expense for a merely temporary
purpose. The two long side-galleries are members'
galleries. That at the farther end, behind and above
the Speaker's chair, is assigned to the reporters for the
press."
"Then that gentleman with the great wig on, seated
in the porch or chair, with the royal arms over it, is
Mr Speaker?'
'Yes; and the gowned and wigged gentlemen sitting
just before him at the table are principal clerks of the
House.'
But the overwhelming moral presumption!'
Wo to the country which, in judicial investigations,
discards the strict, inflexible rules of evidence, to be
guided by overwhelming moral presumption ! No
instrument more potent than that, be assured, to let in
the most tyrannous wrong and injustice. What, if
such a rule obtained in these committees, would there
be to prevent a candidate, certain of being defeated,
from bribing, through an indifferent party, two or three
electors to vote for his opponent, and thereby vitiate
his election ? But come, it is near four o'clock, and
we had better take our places in the waiting-room to
the Strangers' Gallery of the House of Commons.'
"How shall we obtain admittance ?' asked M. Vieux-land; and 105 for Ireland. But it is rare that anything
temps.
Some of the members we shall find about the library
will give us orders. I have never found any difficulty
in procuring one."
I begin, I think,' observed Herr von Blunderblast,
as we retraced our steps towards Abingdon Street, to
comprehend something of this antique picturesque
monarchy we saw the other day, with its heralds,
knights, peers, banners, and devices; and your matter-
of-fact, prosaic, and, I have little doubt, effective modes
of controlling or neutralising its ancient prerogatives
and attributes. Our people, it is already clear to me,
have studied only the husk and shell of your system,
not its inner and vital life.'
'You continentals certainly labour under some strange
fancies respecting our monarchical system. You take
us up too literally. We are a curious mixture. Not-
withstanding the vastness of popular will, the wearer
of the crown, as a centre of authority and fountain of
honour, has still immense influence, and in no instance
has it been, perhaps, more signally and beneficially
displayed than in beating down the vast amount of
sinister objection that was raised against the proposed
and now triumphant display in the Park. But here
we are at the outer door leading to the temporary
Commons' House.'
The orders of admission were easily obtained, and we
ascended the half-dozen steps on the left of the passage
to the Commons, and took our seats in the waiting-
room
Always,' said I, take this seat on the right,
just at the head of the stair. The police of the House
will only permit us to proceed to the gallery in the
order in which we sit, commencing with me. We are
therefore sure of a front seat, and the gallery altogether
will only hold about sixty.'
6
What is that painted on the door yonder?' asked
M. Vieuxtemps, who was rather near-sighted.
"Members' Smoking-room: no Strangers Admitted."'
Ah, then, the Honourable House does smoke.
Hollo! What's that tinkle, tinkle? What does the
bell mean?'
That the Speaker has entered the House, and his
chaplain commenced reading prayers.'
"There it goes again! What may it now betoken?'
That prayers are over. If a House is made, the
gallery will be immediately opened.'
'What do you mean by making a House?'
'If there be forty members present, the House will
be constituted; if less than that number, it will be
ipso facto adjourned. But we are called-it is all
right.'
What a shabbily-fitted House!' said Herr von
Blunderblast as soon as we were seated-' with its
'On the table I perceive lies the mace which Crom-
well bade his soldiers take away.'
'True. The House is getting full. There are in all
656 members, since the borough of Sudbury was dis-
franchised: 498 for England and Wales; 53 for Scot-
like the entire complement are present. The Minis-
terial side of the House is on the Speaker's right-the
Opposition on his left; but there is much confusion in
this respect just now, on account of the number of
independent sections of parties into which the House is
divided.'
'What are those two red boxes on the table opposite
each other for?'
"They are placed there for the reception of papers
necessary to the ministry and the leader of the Oppo-
sition. The first lord of the treasury, Lord John
Russell '-
Which is Lord John Russell?' broke in M. Vieux-
temps with vivacity that short, slight-made gentle-
man, with his hat pulled over his eyes, or nearly so,
and with his legs crossed and arms folded?'
'Yes; and Sir George Grey, much taller, but not
with a more intellectual face, is on this side of the
noble lord. On the same form or seat there now
happen to be sitting the secretary of state for Foreign
Affairs, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the first
lord of the Admiralty. Over against them, and directly
in front of the other red box, sits in what appears to be
a profoundly meditative posture-the honourable mem-
ber for Buckinghamshire, who'
'Ah!' exclaimed M. Vieuxtemps, his dim historical
recollections suddenly bursting forth-*John Hamp-
den!'
'No-no-no, my good friend!' I said, hastening to
correct so strange an anachronism amidst the sup-
pressed titters of the persons around us; not John
Hampden, but a very accomplished and brilliant de-
bater, and now the recognised leader of Opposition—
Mr D'Israeli.'
'Who is the gentleman standing behind one of the
small green baize tables placed crossways on the floor,
about a fourth of the way up the House?'
"Those tables on each side the gangway mark the
bar of the House. The member speaking is reading a
report to the House of one of the committees. They
are always read there, and so are messages from the
Queen when brought down by a minister.'
But where is the tribune?' asked M. Vieuxtemps-
'I do not see it.'
There is none; the members speak from their
places, merely taking off their hats when they rise;
and if more than one rises at once, whoever is named
by the Speaker, proceeds. The formality and fuss of a
tribune would never answer in a House where there
is such a mass of briefly - reported but important
business-speaking going on in the early part of the
sittings.'

Blunderblast. 'I saw that, like all the others, he
bowed slightly on passing the Chair.'
mons.
"That is the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Com-
Armed with the Speaker's warrant, he arrests
members or others accused of breach of privilege
holds them in custody, or conveys them, as may happen,
to Newgate or the Tower. He can obtain any amount
of force necessary for the execution of the orders of the
House.'
That is a formidable power in the hands of a popu-
lar assembly.'
'It is a necessary power, without which the functions
of the House, as the grand inquisition of the realm, could
not be carried on.'
+6
'I observe,' said Herr von Blunderblast, that many
members have a number of rolls of papers in their
hands. What may they be their speeches?'
No-petitions, which they will in a few minutes
present to the House, in the order in which the Speaker
calls their names.'
One gentleman with a very white head, on the right
hand, about half-a-dozen seats above the bar, has a
barrow-load of them.'
'He is one of the members for the city of Dublin,
and Ireland takes a great antagonistic interest in the
chief question for debate this evening.'
What are they doing or saying?' whispered Herr
von Blunderblast after a few minutes' silence. One
of the clerks at the table hands document after docu-
ment to the Speaker, who says something-then writes
something on it, and returns it to the clerk. I cannot
make out what he says except perpetual "ayes" and
"noes," amidst the buzz of the House. The members
are conversing with each other--not attending to the
Speaker.'
The business now going on is merely of a routine
character. The documents handed to the Speaker are
private bills essentially decided upon by the committees
to which they were referred. They are merely now
passing through pro forma stages. That last was a
railway extension bill. The Speaker read its title, and
then said in a breath: "The motion is that this bill
do now pass those that are for it say ay against it no
the ayes have it." He then writes, as you saw, the
decision on the bills, and returns it to the clerk.'
"Yes; but those everlasting ayes and noes only
come from the Speaker's lips. Nobody else says ay,
and nobody else says no: how, then, can the ayes
have it?'
It is, as I told you, a matter chiefly of form. Did
any member object, he would rise, state his objection;
there would be a discussion, and perhaps a division.
These bills, therefore, are really passing without a
dissenting voice: But, see, they begin to present
petitions. The member states the place from whence
the petition comes, the purport of its prayer, and about
the number of signatures attached; he then, as you
see, walks up and places it on the table. Sometimes,
on his motion, the prayer is read at length by the
clerk.'
'Look, that centre clerk is pitching them all under
the table at his feet as fast as they arrive,' cried Herr
von Blunderblast in much too loud a tone, though
fortunately unheard by the gallery official.
He is cramming them into a large, dark-coloured
bag,' I answered. See, here comes an officer of the
House with one already full.'
་
What, then, in the name of common sense, can be
the use of petitioning? Nobody is listening: it is all
buz-buz; and the petitions, placed one moment on
the table, are the next crammed into a huge bag and
carried out of the House!'
They are referred to the Petitions' Committee, by
whom the substance of the prayer, and the number of
petitioners, are recorded and printed, with the votes
and proceedings, for the use and information of the
members.'
What is that cross-firing now going on?' asked
M. Vieuxtemps.
Members putting questions of which they have
given notice to the chiefs of departments, and the replies
of the ministers.'
Wh-e-e-c-w!' whistled Herr von Blunderblast, but
fortunately not too loud. Then a ship-chandler who
has contrived to get into parliament may badger and
worry the first lord of the Admiralty, as that tall
member yonder is doing now?"
•
'No doubt of it. Any M.P. is an exceedingly
important personage; and this is one of the reasons the
office, though unattended with a farthing of remunera-
tion, is so eagerly sought after. Fancy the swelling
importance, the immense delight of Mr Dobbs, who
has by industry and integrity amassed a fortune, and
obtained the suffrages of his fellow-townsmen, but is
still perhaps at first rather shyed by the local aristo-
cracy, finding himself questioning lords, snubbing right
honourables, and possibly reading in the county paper
a leader commencing thus: "The important informa-
tion elicited, or rather, we should say, forcibly wrung,
from the noble lord at the head of the Treasury by
our talented and esteemed member, John Dobbs,
Esq."
232
'Hallo!' interrupted Herr von Blunderblast, the
Speaker has left the chair, and they are hiding the
mace away under the table!'
'It has been moved and carried that the Speaker
leave the chair, in order that the House should go into
committee. When that is the ease the mace is removed,
and the House in committee sit under the presidence
of a chairman: in this instance Mr Bernal, who has
taken his place, you perceive, at the table, by the
clerks.'
What is the rationale of this curious proceeding?'
asked M. Vieuxtemps.
This all public bills, except those relating to taxa-
tion or spirituals, which must be grounded upon a
previous resolution of the whole House in committee,
pass, if successful, through the following stages :-
Leave is given to introduce the bill, and it is read a
first time; after an interval of an indefinite number
of days, it is read a second time; another delay occurs;
and then, as to-night, the House goes into committee
on the bill, with a view to its examination, clause by
clause, line by line, word by word. In committee, a
member may speak upon one question as often as he
chooses; when the Speaker is in the chair, only once.
When the business of the committee is terminated, it
is moved that the chairman report progress, and ask
leave to sit again; which, if carried, has the effect of
bringing the Speaker back to the chair. The House
then resumes, as it is called; the mace is replaced on
the table; and the business of the assembly goes on as
before.'
"Those thundering "hears!" they are the "cheers"
which I have seen marked in the journals,' observed
M. Vieuxtemps. How stirring they are; and what a
roar at times sweeps over the House!'
'Yes; an animated debate in the Commons is an
exciting affair. Men who can take an effective part in
these combats of giants seldom quit the arena unless
compelled to do so. Do you mark how fine, how true,
how ready the collective ear of the House is? The
slightest trip, especially of an ambitious rhetorician,
and what an instant explosion of derisive shouts!
Dulness the House is often patient of, but inflation,
vanity, conceit-never! It is a slippery and ditti-
cult floor to stand firm and erect upon, and requires
very peculiar powers. Gentlemen, and there are a few,
who speak well-reasoned, philosophic pamphlets, are
the bores, the pests of the House. They cannot be
laughed down, and the only remedy is to let them talk

to empty benches. That which best succeeds is the
conventional, but bitter personality-the polite, sub-
dued virulence, which strikes the antagonist rather
than his argument. There! It was nothing but a
brilliant sarcasm, but with what effect it flashed across
the House, awakening as it passed an explosion of
exulting or indignant echoes!'
.1
We remained silent for some time-the debate lilled,
or rather was continued by less effective speakers, and
presently Herr von Blunderblast nudged me sharply
on the side. How's this?' he said we seem to have
just caught that white-headed old gentleman's eye, and
he is ordering all strangers to withdraw.'
1
The House is about to divide, and we must be
off!?ume to undrer a
Out we went and the first out, foremost now, were
ranged in due order for re-entrance by another door.
What did they put us out for?" said Herr von
-Blunderblast, who was somewhat ruffled. *
"The fact is, my good sir, we were not supposed to
be there at all! No stranger has any right to be
present during the deliberations of parliament.'code
Were they, then, not really members who gave us
the orders ?
'Certainly they were; but the Speaker, in accord-
ance with one of our numerous conventional fictions,
is supposed not to be aware of the presence of strangers
in the Honourable House; and should any member call
his attention to the fact, they are at once ordered to
withdraw.'
A by ba
What an utterly ridiculous absurdity this appears
to be!' said M. Vieuxtemps.
Appearance in this case, as in many others, is
deceitful, The custom, absurd as it may appear, has
its uses. The late Mr O'Connell, by its means, easily
defeated a conspiracy on the part of the reporters to
burke his speeches. He had them all regularly turned
out every evening the House sat; and as the pur-
chasers of newspapers must have the parliamentary
reports, the gentlemen of the press were obliged to
give in.
There is another apparent absurdity and
contradiction: a gallery is set apart for reporters, and
yet it is a breach of privilege, punishable by imprison-
ment, to publish the debates. This seeming absurdity
has also its uses. The understanding of course is, that
the proceedings shall be fairly reported; that no one
shall be libelled or ridiculed by the pretended report of
a speech. Should such an offence be committed, the
printer of the newspaper, as the law now stands, may be
summoned to the bar of the House, and summarily
punished, technically for publishing the debates, but
really for the libel or slander. Were it otherwise, the
Honourable House would have to pursue the offender in
a court of law, to the manifest loss of its dignity and
prestige.1
1
I shall never comprehend it!' murmured Herr von
Blunderblast once more. Never!
We were soon in, and soon out again. Again we
returned, and presently were again excluded.
What is the meaning of all this ? exclaimed Herr
von Blunderblast, who was getting very hot and
furious.
1
The minority-about forty to four hundred-will
not permit the bill under discussion to be further
- proceeded with to-night; and are moving adjournment
after adjournment.'
1
"Then why, in the name of common sense, do not
the majority put an end to such obstruction ??.
To be sure!' exclaimed M. Vieuxtemps. Why do
they not vote la clôture-the close of the discussion, or
speech-making?'
Simply because the majority have no power to do
so; and God forbid they ever should have! Nothing
more deplorably evinces the utter want of compre-
hension on the part of continental nations who have
copied the externals of our representative system, than
that precious clôture of theirs; a mode whereby a
majority, not satisfied with outvoting their opponents,
of enacting laws to which the people represented by
the minority decidedly object, gag them into the
bargain. M. Guizot, the year before last, gave his
valuable opinion, before a committee of the House
appointed to consider whether any means could be
adopted of shortening the debates, grounding himself
of course upon the great constitutional experience of
France, that la clôture was a sufficient and quite unob-
jectionable remedy; whereas anything more dangerous,
more likely to damage irretrievably the representative
form of government, could scarcely be devised. It
would not at all events do here. There is a tradition
that John Lambton-Black Jack, as he was familiarly
called in the north, afterwards Earl Durham--once
moved that fresh candles be brought in," as an
amendment upon an obnoxious measure which the
ministry of the day were endeavouring to hurry
through the House of course only the more empha-
tically to mark his determination that the matter
should not be so hurried/y7238,
According to your doctrine,' rejoined M. Vieuxtemps,
'a minority might defeat any and every measure to
which they objected.'
Just as the Commons might upset all government
by refusing the necessary supplies, the Lords refuse
to pass any bill sent up to them, the Queen veto every
measure concurred in by the two Houses. These
extreme rights exist; and a government of legislative
compromise the safest of all modes of progress-is
the consequence. The practical result of the right of
the minorities in both Houses is to insure ample
discussion; and you may be sure of this, that nothing
is more politic than to allow a beaten party to have
their full say. But, allons! it is useless to re-enter
the gallery merely to be turned out again, and we had
better be jogging homewards.'
1
6
It is a piece of many-coloured patchwork this
governmental system of yours,' said Herr von Blunder-
blast as we emerged into the street, which I can
comprehend, though dimly as yet, may practically
answer much better than more surface-perfect schemes.
But you have not explained how the army--after all,
the true force-is to be effectually controlled by
speeches, votes, bits of parchment.'
Oh, the Honourable House has a charming con-
trivance for that purpose; the Bill of Rights declares
that standing armies in time of peace are illegal.'
6
Illegal! Why, your standing army numbers up-
wards of one hundred thousand men !'
'Just so; because every session there originates in
the Commons. what is called the Mutiny Bill, which,
first reciting the unquestionable illegality, enacts that,
for various reasons, the crown inay, for one year only
from that date, levy, maintain, and martially govern
regular troops. That act not renewed, the soldiers
might walk off to their homes; the corporal, harshly
dealt with, if so minded, might knock down his captain
with impunity; and the entire army, in fact, would
fall at once and utterly to pieces.'
Then the Mutiny Bill is necessary indeed!'
'It is so; but you have yet much to learn. To-morrow,
remember, we visit the Lords.'
'A picturesque and magnificent edifice,' said Herr
von Blunderblast, looking, as we shook hands, at the
new palace, but thinking, I could see, much more of
its inner life than its exterior aspect; and yet many
of the people who have erected and still maintain it
deny that it possesses either beauty or excellence.'
"That is true; but it is not the Victoria Tower, nor
the flowering capitals, nor the carved vaultings, which
any of my countrymen in their heart of hearts object
to: they are merely of opinion that the clustering
columns which support the building should have more
shafts. They may be right or wrong; but at all events

the shafts, to be either safe or useful, should be in
some degree prepared and fitted for the purpose.
Good-by!'
THE
BEAR-STEAK.
A GASTRONOMIC ADVENTURE,
THE Englishman's predilection for a beefsteak is almost
proverbial, but we fancy it would take some time to
reconcile John Bull in general to a bear-steak, however
much we might expatiate to him on its excellence and
the superiority of its flavour over that of his old-estab-
lished favourite, however confidently we might assure
him that the bear was a most delicate feeder, selecting
the juiciest fruits of the forest and the most esculent
roots of the earth for his ordinary nourishment. It
might be supposed that this dislike to bear's flesh as
an article of food arose from our national aversion to
everything that is outlandish; but the following gas-
tronomic adventure, related in the pages of a modern
French traveller, proves that our frog-eating neigh-
bours find it just as difficult to surmount their aversion
to feeding on the flesh of Master Bruin as the most
sturdy and thoroughbred Englishman among us.
M. Alexandre Dumas, after a long mountainous
walk, arrived about four o'clock one fine autumn after-
noon at the inn at Martigny. Exercise and the keen
mountain air had combined to sharpen his appetite,
and he inquired from the host, with some degree of
eagerness, at what hour the table-d'hôte dinner was
usually served.
'At half-past five,' replied the host.
"That will do very well,' rejoined M. Dumas; 'I
shall then have time to visit the old castle before
dinner.
Punctual to the appointed hour the traveller re-
turned, but found to his dismay that every seat at the
long table was already occupied. The host, however,
who appeared to have taken M. Dumas, even at first
sight, into his especial favour, approached him with a
courteous smile, and, pointing to a small side-table
carefully laid out, said: Here, sir, this is your place.
I had not enough of bear-steak left to supply the whole
table-d'hôte with it; and, besides, most of my guests
have tasted this bear already, so I reserved my last
steak for you: I was sure you would like it.' So
saying, the good-natured host placed in the centre of
the table a fine, juicy-looking steak, smoking hot, and
very tempting in appearance; but glad would the hungry
traveller have been could he only have believed that it
was a beef, and not a bear-steak, which now lay before
him. Visions of the miserable-looking animals he had
seen drowsily slumbering away existence in a mena-
gerie, or covered with mud, and led about by a chain,
for the amusement of the multitude, presented them-
selves to the traveller's eyes, and he would fain have
turned away from the proffered treat. But he could
not find it in his heart to be so ungracious as to express
a dislike to food which the host evidently considered
as the choicest delicacy the country could afford. He
accordingly took his seat at the table, and cut off a
small slice of the steak; then screwing his courage to the
sticking-point, and opening his mouth wide, as if about
to demolish a bolus, he heroically gulped the dreaded
morsel. Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute. He had
no sooner achieved this feat than he began to think
that bear-flesh was, after all, not quite so bad a thing
as he had expected. He swallowed a second morsel.
'It was really the tenderest and most juicy steak he
had ever tasted.' 'Are you sure this is a bear-steak?'
he inquired of the landlord.
'Yes, sir, I can assure you it is,' replied the good-
natured bustling man as he hurried off to attend upon
his other guests at the table-d'hôte. Before he returned
to M. Dumas at the side-table, three-quarters of the
steak had disappeared; and, highly gratified at finding
his favourite dish was so much approved of, he renewed
the conversation by observing: That was a famous
beast I can tell you; it weighed three hundred and
twenty pounds.'
'A fine fellow indeed he must have been,' rejoined
the traveller.
'It cost no small trouble to kill him.'
'I can well believe that,' rejoined M. Dumas, at the
same time raising the last morsel to his mouth.
'He devoured half the huntsman who shot him!!
added the loquacious landlord.
"
Hastily flinging aside the loathed morsel which he
had just placed within his lips, the traveller indig-
nantly exclaimed: How dare you pass such jokes upon
a man when he is in the middle of his dinner?'.
I can assure you, sir, I am not joking,' replied the
landlord: 'I am only telling you the simple truth.'
The traveller, whose appetite for further food of any
description whatever was by this time effectually de-
stroyed, rose from table, and with a look of horror,
begged that the host would acquaint him with the par-
ticulars of the tragedy which had now acquired in his
eyes so painful an interest. The good man, nothing
loth to hear himself talk, yielded a ready acquiescence
to this request, and continued his story as follows:
You must know, sir, the man who killed this bear
was a poor peasant belonging to the village of Fouly,
and named William Mona. This animal, of which
there now only remains the small morsel you have left
upon your plate, used to come every night and steal
his pears, giving a special preference to the fruit of one
fine pear-tree laden with bergamottes. Now it so
happened that William Mona unfortunately also pre-
ferred the bergamottes to all other fruit. He at first
imagined that it was some of the children of the village
who committed these depredations in his orchard, and
having consequently loaded his gun with powder only,
he placed himself in ambush that he might give them a
good fright. Towards eleven o'clock at night he heard
a distant growl. Ho, ho!' said he, there is a bear
somewhere in the neighbourhood.' Ten minutes after-
wards a second growl was heard; but this time it was
so loud and so near at hand that he began to fear he
should scarcely have time to reach a place of refuge,
and threw himself flat upon the ground, in the earnest
hope that the bear would be satisfied with taking his
pears instead of devouring himself. A few moments
of anxious suspense ensued, during which the bear,
passing within ten paces of the terrified peasant, ad-
vanced in a straight line towards the pear-tree in
question. He climbed it with the utmost agility, al-
though its branches creaked beneath the weight of his
ponderous body; and having secured for himself a
comfortable position, committed no small havoc among
the luscious bergamottes. Having gorged himself to
his heart's content, he slowly descended from the tree,
and returned in tranquil dignity towards his mountain
home. All this had occupied about an hour, during
which, time had appeared to travel at a much slower
pace with the man than it did with the bear,
William Mona was, however, at heart a brave and
resolute man, and he said to himself, as he watched his
enemy's retiring steps: He may go home this time,
if he pleases, but, Master Bruin, we shall meet again.'
The next day one of his neighbours, who came to visit
him, found him sawing up the teeth of a pitchfork,
and transforming them into slugs.
'What are you about there?' he asked.
'I am amusing myself,' replied William. The neigh
bour, taking up one of the pieces of iron, turned it
over and over in his hand, like a man who understood
such things, and then said quietly:
If you were to own the truth, William, you would
acknowledge that these little scraps of iron are des-
tined to pierce a tougher skin than that of the
chamois.'

Perhaps they may,' replied William.

You know that I am an honest fellow,' resumed
Francis (for so was the neighbour called): well, if
you choose, we will divide the bear between us; two
men in such a case are better than one.'
That's as it may be,' replied William, at the same
time cutting his third slug.
'I'll tell you what,' continued Francis, 'I will leave
you in full possession of the skin, and we will only
share the flesh between us, together with the bounty
offered by government for every bear that is killed,
and which will give us forty francs a piece.'
'I should prefer having the whole myself,' replied
William.
'But you cannot prevent me from seeking the bear's
track in the mountain, and placing myself in ambush
on his passage.
'You are free to do that, if you please.' So saying,
William, who had now completed the manufacture of
his slugs, began to measure out a charge of powder
double in amount to that usually placed in a carabine.
'I see you intend to use your musket?' said Francis.
"Yes, of course I do; three iron slugs will do their
work more surely than a leaden bullet.'
(
They will spoil the skin.'
'Never mind that, if they do their work more
effectually.'
And when do you intend to commence your chase?'
'I will tell you that to-morrow.'
'Once more, then-are you quite determined not to
let me share the chance with you?'
'Yes; I prefer managing the whole matter myself,
and sharing neither the danger nor the profit-chacun
pour soi.
"Farewell, then, neighbour-I wish you success.'
In the evening, as Francis was passing Mona's
dwelling, he saw the huntsman quietly seated on the
bench before his door, engaged in smoking his pipe.
He once more approached him and said:
See, I bear you no ill-will-I have discovered the
bear's track, therefore I might lie in wait for him and
shoot him, if I pleased, without your help; but I have
come once more to you, to propose that we should
attack him together.'
'Each one for himself,' replied William, as before.
Francis knew nothing of Mona's proceedings during
the remainder of that evening, except that his wife saw
him take up his musket at about half-past ten o'clock,
roll up a bag of gray sackcloth, place it under his arm,
and leave the house. She did not venture to ask him
what he was about; for Mona, in such cases, was apt
to tell her to hold her tongue, and not trouble herself
about matters which did not concern her.
Francis had really in the meantime tracked the bear,
as he had said he would. He had followed its traces as
far as the border of William's orchard, and, not liking
to trespass upon his neighbour's territory, he then took
up his post on the borders of the pine-wood which lay
on the slope of the hill overhanging Mona's garden.
As it was a clear night, he could observe with ease
from this spot all that was going on below. He saw
the huntsman leave his house, and advance towards a
gray rock, which had rolled down from the adjoining
heights into the centre of his little enclosure, and
now stood at the distance of about twenty paces from
his favourite pear-tree. There Mona paused, looked
round as if to ascertain that he was quite alone, un-
rolled his sack, and slipped into it, only allowing his
head and his two arms to emerge above the opening.
Having thus in a great measure concealed his person,
he leaned back against the rock, and remained so per-
fectly still that even his neighbour, although he knew
him to be there, could not distinguish him from the
lifeless stone. A quarter of an hour thus elapsed in
patient expectation. At last a distant growl was
heard, and in less than five minutes afterwards the
bear appeared in sight. But whether by accident, or
whether it were that he had scented the second hunts-
man, he did not on this occasion follow his usual track,
but diverging towards the right, escaped falling into
the ambush which Francis had prepared for him.
William in the meantime did not stir an inch. It
might have been imagined that he did not even see the
savage animal for which he was lying in wait, and
which seemed to brave him by passing so closely
within the reach of his gun. The bear, on his side,
appeared quite unconscious of an enemy's presence,
and advanced with rapid strides towards the tree.
But at the moment when he rose upon his hind legs,
in order to clasp the trunk with his fore-paws, thus
leaving his breast exposed, and no longer protected by
his broad and massive shoulders, a bright flash of light
illuminated the face of the rock, and the whole valley
re-echoed with the report of the doubly-loaded gun,
together with the loud howl which proceeded from the
wounded animal. The bear fled from the fatal spot,
passing once more within ten paces of William without
perceiving him. The latter had now taken the addi-
tional precaution of drawing the sack over his head,
and rested motionless as before against the face of the
rock.
Francis, with his musket in his hand, stood beneath
the shelter of the wood, a silent and breathless spec-
tator of the scene. He is a bold huntsman, but he
owned to me that he fairly wished himself at home
when he saw the enormous animal, furious from its
wound, bearing straight down upon the spot where he
stood. He made the sign of the cross (for our hunters,
sir, are pious men), commended his soul to God, and
looked to see that his gun was well loaded. Already
was the bear within a few paces of the pine-wood; in
two minutes more a deadly encounter must take place,
in which Francis was well aware that either he or the
bear must fall, when suddenly the wounded animal
paused, raised his nostrils in the air, as if catching
some scent which was borne by the breeze, and then
uttering one furious growl, he turned hastily round,
and rushed back towards the orchard.
Take care of yourself, William-take care!' ex-
claimed Francis, at the same time darting forward in
pursuit of the bear, and forgetting everything else in
his anxiety to save his old comrade from the terrible
danger which threatened him; for he knew well that if
William had not had time to reload his gun, it was all
over with him-the bear had evidently scented him.
But suddenly a fearful cry-a cry of human terror and
human agony-rent the air: it seemed as though he
who uttered it had concentrated every energy in that
one wild, despairing cry-an appeal to God and man→→
'Help! oh, help, help!' A dead silence ensued: not
even a single moan was heard to succeed that cry of
anguish. Francis flew down the slope with redoubled
speed, and as he approached the rock, he began yet
more clearly to distinguish the huge animal, which had
hitherto been half-concealed beneath its shade, and
perceived that the bear was trampling under foot, and
rending to pieces, the prostrate form of his unfortunate
assailant.
Francis was now close at hand; but the bear, still
intent upon his prey, did not even seem aware of his
presence. He did not venture to fire, for terror and
dismay had unnerved his arm, and he feared that he
might miss his aim, and perhaps shoot his unhappy
friend, if indeed he yet continued to breathe. He took
up a stone and threw it at the bear. The infuriated
animal turned immediately upon this new and unex-
pected foe, and raising himself upon his hind legs, pre-
pared to give him that formidable hug, which the ex-
perienced huntsman well knew would prove a last
embrace. Paralysed with fear, his presence of mind had
wellnigh deserted him, when all of a sudden he became
conscious that the animal was pressing the point of his

gun with its shaggy breast. Mechanically almost he
placed his finger upon the lock, and pulled the trigger."
The bear fell backwards-the ball had this time done
its work effectually. It had pierced through his breast,
and shattered the spinal bone. The huntsman, leaving
the expiring animal upon the ground, now hastened to
his comrade's side. But, alas! it was too late for
human assistance to be of any avail. The unfortunate
man was so completely mutilated, that it would have
been impossible even to recognise his form. With a
sickening heart, Francis hastened to call for help; for
he could perceive by the lights which were glancing in
the cottage windows that the unwonted noise had roused
many of the villagers from their slumbers. A
Before many moments had elapsed, almost all the
inhabitants of the village were assembled in poor
Mona's orchard, and his wife among the rest. I need
not describe the dismal scene. A collection was made
for the poor widow' through the whole valley of the
Rhone, and a sum of seven hundred francs was thrus
raised. Francis insisted upon her receiving the govern-
ment bounty, and sold the flesh and the skin of the
bear for her benefit. In short, all her neighbours
united to assist her to the utmost of their power. We
innkeepers also agreed to open a subscription list at
our respective houses, in case any travellers should
wish to contribute a trifle; and in case you, sir, should
be disposed to put down your name for a small sum, I
should take it as a great favour.
'Most assuredly,' replied M. Dumas, as he rose from
the table, and cast a parting glance of horror at the
last morsel of the bear-steak, inwardly vowing never
again to make experiments in gastronomy.
WEOVIL BISCUIT MANUFACTORY.;
A YEAR or two ago we gave a short account of the
celebrated biscuit manufactory of Mr Carr at Carlisle,
where machinery of an ingenious kind was made to
do wonders in the way of turning out vast quantities
of small fancy biscuits, which formerly were made only
by hand. We have now the satisfaction of presenting
a notice of the not very dissimilar process of biscuit-
baking pursued at Weovil, in the south of England; a
place known by public report through the frequent
visits of Her Majesty in passing to and from Osborne
House.
At Weovil are produced biscuits for the royal navy,
and there, as at Carlisle, the motive power is a large
steam-engine, whose agency is visible in all parts of
the establishment. The services of this engine com-
mence with the arrival of a cargo of wheat under the
walls of the building; and we should have a very
imperfect notion of the ingenuity displayed in the
establishment if we did not examine some of the earlier
processes. Let us, then, begin with the beginning;
and having observed that the wheat is lifted by a
steam - worked crane from the lighter to the upper-
most floor, let us descend to the floor below, and ex-
amine the first process to which it is submitted-
that of cleaning. The grain supplied from above flows
in a continual stream into one end of a cylinder of
fine wirework, about two feet in diameter and ten
in length, which revolves steadily in a horizontal po-
sition. A spiral plate runs through the interior of
this cylinder, dividing it into several sections, and
thus forming a sort of Archimedean screw. The revo-
lutions of this cylinder carry the grain onwards through
its whole length, so that in the passage any particles
of dirt that may have been mixed with it fall through
the interstices of the wirework. The effectual cha-
racter of this operation is exemplified by the quantities
of dirt deposited from wheat which to all appearance
was clean before entering the cylinder; the grain thus
thoroughly cleansed, descends another stage to the
grinding-room (for the wheat is ground on the pre-
mises), where ten pairs of millstones are worked by the
same steam-power. There is nothing peculiar in the
process of grinding; but the manner in which the flour
is afterwards collected deserves notice. As it flows
from the several stones, it is led into horizontal troughs,
along which it is propelled by the action of perpetual
screws working in each trough. The contents of all
the troughs are brought to one point, whence, by means
of a succession of plates or buckets revolving round
a wheel on the principle of a chain-pump or dredging-
machine, the flour is lifted to the storey above, where
it is cooled, sifted, and put into sacks, for removal ·
to the bakehouse. It is not long since we observed in
a newspaper the announcement of an invention for
collecting and saving the impalpable powder which
flies off in the process of grinding corn, and which,
containing the purest portions of the flour, has hitherto
been wasted. This saving has not yet been effected at
Weovil, as our whitened appearance on leaving the
mill-room sufficiently testified; but, doubtless, the zeal
and ingenuity that has introduced the improvements
we are describing will not stop short while anything
remains to be done.
theatre of Mr Grant's ingenuity. We are in a large
We now arrive at the bakehouse, the principal
room on the ground floor-it may be one hundred and
twenty feet in length, lofty, and well lighted, the centre
portions of which are occupied by machinery of no very
complex aspect; and it may be a dozen men and boys,'
slipshod and barearmed, are moving here and there
amongst it. There is no bustle, no confusion; and not-"
withstanding the unceasing movements of the machi-
nery, very little noise. We are at once sensible that,
we are witnessing a scene of well-organized industry;
but we can hardly persuade ourselves that we see the
whole staff employed in converting flour into biscuit at'
the rate of one hundred sacks per day. In the midst
of the general activity, the eye is caught by the figure
of one man whose attitude of repose contrasts strangely
with the movements going on all round him. He seems
to have nothing to do but to lean listlessly with one.or
both of his elbows on the top of a sort of box or chest,
much resembling an ordinary stable corn-bin, which
stands against the wall at the left of the entrance; yet
that occupation will not account for the mealy state of
his bare arms: let us look into the bin, and see if we'
can discover anything. The bottom of it is filled with
water, just above the surface of which, extending from
end to end, we see a circular shaft armed with iron
blades, crossing it at intervals of two inches apart, and.
protruding six inches or more on each side of the axle,
at right angles with it, and with each other. In one
corner of the bin is the mouth of a pipe, which, even
whilst we look, discharges an avalanche of flour into the
water; at the same moment some invisible power causes
the shaft to revolve-slowly at first, that the light dust
may not entirely blind us; then, as the flour becomes
more and more saturated with water, rapidly and more.
rapidly, until the whole is thoroughly mixed up to-
gether; and in the space of four and a half minutes,
one hundredweight of flour is converted into dough.
The revolutions of the shaft now cease, and our hither-
to inactive friend proceeds to transfer the contents of
the bin to a board placed to receive them, in masses

Again, we see that the surface which a moment since was

The lower side of the plate, in fact,
consists of a bed of sharp-edged punches of hexagonal
form, reminding us in appearance of a gigantic honey-
comb, which at one blow divides the dough into single

shape manifestly economises labour in the manufacture
and space in stowage, while it is hardly more liable
than the former to waste by breakage. When it is
borne in mind that before the introduction of this
machinery every single biscuit was separately kneaded,

productive powers of the establishment have been

notice that the fires by which they are heated are con-
tinually burning in one corner of them, even while the
baking goes on; so that as soon as one batch of biscuits
is withdrawn, the floor is ready for another. A light
frame, on which are deposited the trays of biscuits as
they issue from the stamp-office, is wheeled up to the
oven: the trays are transferred by the baker to the
mouth, and thence, by means of a long pole armed with
a hook, pushed to the farthest recesses of the oven,
where they are carefully ranged side by side, to the
number of twelve, when the cargo is complete, and the
door is shut upon them. Formerly it was the work of
two men to charge the oven; one wielded the peel,
which the other supplied with single biscuits; and we
have watched with much amusement the unerring
accuracy with which constant practice had enabled the
latter to hit the mark from a distance of several feet.
The new mode is perhaps more prosaic: but not only
is the saving of labour great, but it is easy to conceive
that the action of the heat can be regulated with more
uniformity under it than under the tedious system of
introducing and removing the biscuits singly. In four-
teen minutes the baking is completed; and thus, in
twenty-eight minutes from its first admixture with
water, we have a sack of flour weighing one hundred-
weight converted into the like weight of biscuits, fit for
immediate consumption. A subsequent exposure of
two or three days to the high temperature of a room
over the ovens, is all that is required to render them fit

this limited amount of work is more than sufficient to
keep up the requisite supply of bread for the navy;
and it is frequently found necessary to stop on alter-
nate days, to prevent the stores accumulating beyond
what is desirable. If the whole force of the establish-
ment were set in motion, it would easily, our guide
informs us, supply 10,000 men with half a pound of

JHELLA BORE.
A PERUSAL of the adventures of Moran Shillelah in
a recent number of the Journal has recalled to my
Old Indian mind certain reminiscences of a creature
who, although in many respects unlike the Irish idiot,
closely resembled him in one point; namely, in the
of sympathy in his own town and neighbourhood, a
devoted and reciprocal attachment between himself and
his teacher and protector. As he used to be an object

All I knew of Jhellâbore was, that he was an orphan,
and that he had been placed by his father in charge
of a respectable moollâh,† who kept a school, and with
whom he resided when I first knew him. The moollah
had many scholars, but none like Jhellabore: for
Mogul he was fair, and really a beautiful boy, with

ter, who had the same taste, gave him every encourage-
ment. Jhellâbore divided his time between reading
his favourite bards and strolling in a neighbouring
flower-garden. He might constantly be seen among
the gorgeous and strong-scented plants of his sunny
clime, reposing in arbours of chemêleis and bélas, or
tending the Persian rose or rich white ghonderaj (the
king of odours), till the moon shone out in her silvery
splendour; and oft would he stand as if transfixed,
gazing on the spangled sky, and chanting sonorous and
impassioned verses from Hafiz or Saadi.
Doubtless, the impassioned youth's ardent admiration
of poetry and flowers, combined with his zeal as a
scholar, occasioned his aberration of mind. His imagi-
nation was nurtured at the expense of his other facul-
ties. He read and felt till he conjured up aërial visions,
the most vivid of which seems to have been a female
form of heavenly birth-a houri, with whom he was
in love. He became, in short, an Oriental nymphalept.
At last, when his reason was completely undermined,
and he could no longer study-he was then about
eighteen years of age-he used to wander about in his
favourite garden, clean and tastefully arrayed, with his
beautiful black hair hanging in ringlets. He never wore
the Mohammedan dress, as he disliked long sleeves and
thick clothing. His dhotee* was of the most beautiful
muslin, dyed of some fanciful hue, sometimes rose-
colour, sometimes sky-blue, and a silver-edged hand-
kerchief encircled his waist. Over his shoulders was
thrown a scarf of the same materials, and dyed to har-
monise with his dhotee. In all this, notwithstanding
the unhinged state of his mind, he continued to shew
much taste and refinement. The garlands of flowers
round his neck and upon his breast were too numerous
to be counted, but they were never faded or soiled. A
yellow champala flower stuck behind his ear contrasted
well with his black locks, and a bouquet of roses or a
punka† of bela buds was in his hand; and a pair of neat
buff-leather slippers completed his picturesque dress.
He seldom walked out alone in the evenings, but had
generally some young gay Mogul companions with him.
With these he would enter into conversation, but would
occasionally come to a stand-still, and exclaim, with
eyes fixed on the heavens, Beautiful, rosy-lipped en-
chantress!-goddess of indescribable loveliness! - I
greet thee!' Whom do you see?' was sometimes
asked. 'It is my Peri-my beloved-ask no more!'
was the answer.
The moollâh seemed to have regarded the orphan not
only as a pupil but as an adopted child, and they had
become strongly attached to each other. His death
was deeply felt by Jhellâbore, and was probably un-
mixed with selfish regrets, though by this event he was
left without support. But Jhellabore was a general
favourite, and his young friends took care to supply
him with finery, flowers, and a little money; so his
days glided on as before, and he never thought of to-
morrow. The patron of the deceased moolláh had no
doubt been an opulent man. The little dwelling and
schoolroom had been his gift to the teacher, and after
his death they seemed to have become the property of
Jhellabore, for there he continued to abide. Adjoin-
ing there was also an old-looking tomb-that of the
patron, surrounded by a light open-worked trellis-wall,
such as may be seen in white marble around the tomb
of Momtaza, in the Taj Mahal at Agra. Within the
enclosure was a vacant space for another grave, and
here the moollah was also buried, and a similar tomb
built over him; and so, united in death, the rich and
the poor, the protector and the protected, rested to-
gether near the scene of their earthly labours.
After the burial-ground had been neatly finished and

decorated, a divan and carpet were placed in it by some
charitable hand. Upon these Jhellâbore rested when
weary, and there, three times a day, he read the Koran,
and performed his devotions; and this, notwithstand-
ing his derangement, he could do with propriety and
solemnity. The former proprietor of the ground might
have rested disregarded and forgotten but for Jhella-
bore the maniac. There, for his sake, many a passer-
by stopped to see the marks of his devoted love to his
earthly benefactors and his God.
Many a copper coin was cast, many handfuls of
cowries were scattered upon the two whitewashed graves,
along with wreaths of sweet-scented flowers, while
heaps of little horses* of baked clay lay piled up in one
corner. Often have I and my dear old father contri-
buted our adhêlah, or half rupee, at the sainted shrine
(for such it had now almost become), and marvelled
how good frequently accrued from evil; for in all this
the Christian could not but trace the finger of God,
whatever might be thought of it by the Moslem or
Hindoo. As darkness came on, Jhellâbore lit his gay-
coloured lanterns of talc and gilt paper; and at the
head of his master's grave, under the hollow pillar
surmounted by a turban, always blazed a cherang or
lamp, with sweet-scented oil, while loban or frank-
incense exhaled its odours around it, and there, during

What became of Jhellabore eventually I know not.
Perhaps he was of too ardent and excitable a tempera-
ment to be long for this earth. I left the place, and
other objects occupied my mind, yet the recollection of
the youthful enthusiast is still fresh in my memory.
Before I take my leave of Jhellâbore, I may remark
that his countrymen-many of whom are superstitious
and illiterate-ascribed his insanity to the influence of
supernatural beings. His wanderings among the flowers
at eve was pronounced bad, very bad! Every plant
and almost every flower in the East has a mythic or
romantic tale attached to it, or belongs to some genius
or deity. And to pluck flowers, or even to touch
plants and trees at dusk, when all the good and evil
spirits are supposed to be abroad, is always forbidden,
especially to the young and beautiful.
MEMS FOR MUSICAL MISSES.
SIT in a simple, graceful, unconstrained posture.
Never turn up the eyes, or swing about the body: the
expression you mean to give, if not heard and felt, will
never be understood by those foolish motions which
are rarely resorted to but by those who do not really
feel what they play. Brilliancy is a natural gift, but
great execution may be acquired: let it be always
distinct, and however loud you wish to be, uever
thump. Practise in private music far more difficult
than that you play in general society, and aim more at
pleasing than astonishing. Never bore people with ugly
music merely because it is the work of some famous
composer, and do not let the pieces you perform before
people not professedly scientific be too long.
If you
mean to play at all, do so at once when requested:
those who require much pressing are generally more
severely criticised than others who good-humouredly
and unaffectedly try to amuse the company by being
promptly obliging. Never carry books about with you
unasked; learn by heart a variety of different kinds of
music to please all tastes. Be above the vulgar folly
of pretending that you cannot play for dancing; for it
proves only that if not disobliging, you are stupid.
The chief rule in performing this species of music is to
be strictly accurate as to time, loud enough to be
heard amid the noise of the dancers' feet, and always

KEAN AND GARRICK.
Edmund Kean was a great favourite of Mrs Garrick, the
widow of the celebrated actor. Whenever it was desirable
that a new performer at Drury Lane should make a hit,
the committee used to bring the venerable old lady out to
her private box, to say he reminded her of David. She
said so, and this went the round of the papers accord-
ingly. In the case of Kean she spoke honestly. He did
remind her of her husband, and was nearer to him by
many degrees than any actor she had ever seen, although
both agreed he could not play Abel Drugger. Once in
conversation he complained to her that the papers made
terrible mistakes as to his conceptions of character,
readings, points, and other peculiarities. 'These people,'
said he, don't understand their business; they give me
credit where I make no effort to deserve it, and they pass
over the passages on which I have bestowed the utmost
care and attention. They think because my style is new
and appears natural that I don't study, and talk about
the sudden impulse of genius. There is no such thing as
impulsive acting; all is studied beforehaud. A man may
act better or worse on a particular night from particular
circumstances, but the conception is the same. I have
done all these things a thousand times in country theatres,
and perhaps better, before I was recognised as a great
London actor, and have been loudly applauded; but the
sound never reached as far as London.' You should

son was a hanger-on without employment. The grand-
children of the male sex were either writing gratis as
candidates in government offices, or at school, or at
home, according to their respective ages. Several of the
eldest of these again were also married, and had their
wives with them. Many such families as this are to be

TIME.
•
SATURDAY, JULY 12, 1851.
TIME is the life of God. We speak of eternity as if it
were something contradistinguished from time; but it
is merely a term to express our inability to imagine a
beginning or an end to time. We cannot indeed ima-
gine time as otherwise than eternal. Sublime thought!
and sublime also in no small degree is our connection
with it, even limiting our consideration of that connec-
tion to the present form of our existence. We can
look but a little way forwards or backwards, and find
even in that restricted range of vision much obscurity
and doubt. Yet how grand to be able to extend in any
degree whatever our notion of merely passing time-
that in which we happen to live! It is like extending
our very life itself. Upon this depends most of the
pleasure which men have in historical or antiquarian
research, and also in the investigations of geology,
which may be called the antiquarianism of the pre-
human world. The animal knows and can learn nothing
of such things. The ignorant man, who lives only for
the day, and in the day, is in the like predicament. It
is the privilege of the studious and reflecting man of an
advanced civilisation to know them, and to feel how
greatly they exalt and expand his terrestrial being.
A zealous scientific inquiry into the past is of such
modern date that our retrospect cannot as yet be
considered as very clear or precise. It would be rash
to lay great stress upon any of its deductions. It is
interesting, however, to find that the general tendency
of the research is to shew mundane things as of much
longer endurance than was formerly supposed. Geo-
logy has already seen at an end all objections to the
vast chronology which it seeks to establish for the
world before man became its ruling inhabitant. Each
of its many formations represents an enormous portion
of time. Take that of the coal strata alone. If it be
true, as most geologists now believe, that each bed of
coal is only the last form of a bed of moss-that is, a
decayed forest-how great must be the space of time
involved in the production of the entire coal series,
which in many places is composed of scores of such
beds! Look again to the phenomena of disintegration,
or the wearing away of rocks. The forming of a cliff
by the beating of the waves is a process which we may
well see, from the slowness of the operation before our
eyes, to involve a great space of time. The wearing

and more of such minutes are continually being found,

and inserted in the ever-increasing round. Well may
the geologists talk of millions of years as involved in
the history of that mere crust of the earth with which
they deal!
To a perfectly corresponding purport is the voice of
historical research. The commencement of the Egyp-
tian monarchy, and consequently of a system of civi-
lisation in that country, is now taken back many
centuries before its former date. Some speak of nearly
four thousand years before Christ, and none speak of
fewer than four- and - thirty centuries. This is the
result of an inquiry into hieroglyphical memorials.
But that is not the only means by which we may
supply the defect of expressly-written records. The
scientific antiquary has dug into the earth for a
chronicle of unlettered man, resembling that which
geology supplies regarding the lower animals. He
finds that all round the coasts of Europe, where
civilised nations now dwell, there existed nations for a
long series of ages prior to their getting either pens

to Egypt, in particular, the memorials of a Stone Period
are traced in the knives of obsidian, and other mineral
implements, which, with the characteristic perseverance
of religious usages, continued to be employed in em-
balming after better implements had been obtained for
other purposes. Now, add to Egyptian history first a
Bronze Period, and then a Stone Period, and it must be
seen that we take back the actual commencement of
the business of humanity in that region to a point
earlier than the most fabulous historians could have
ventured to dream of. It is as likely to be ten thou-
sand years ago as five or six. And, after all, was this
the oldest group of people describable as a nation? That
the human race has lived longer on the earth than
even the last-mentioned sum would indicate is mani-
fest from other considerations-as, for example, the
slowness of the process of modification by which
various sections of the human family become distin-
guished from one another. If all men have come from
one centre and one type, the space of time which
would be required for enabling them to put on those
peculiarities of figure, style of visage, and, above all,
complexion, which we see they have retained with so
little change throughout our thirty or five-and-thirty
historical centuries, must have been immense. On such
a point we can only go by vague impressions; but it
does not appear very irrational to suppose that two
hundred centuries may have elapsed- if not more
than even that since first the Maker of man placed
him upon the earth.
When the results of scientific research are presented
in even this imperfect form, if they only suffice to
extend the reader's ideas of the duration of this mun-
dane frame of things, they will surely be admitted to
make good our starting proposition. It was at first
thought ill of that the world was represented as being
elder than six thousand years; but now that we have
learned to think of it as so much older, how poor does
the former idea appear! We must all feel that an
ancient world is most correspondent to the Ancient of
Days, by whom it was created.
the great fabric which it requires myriads of creatures
like itself to complete. Man works in the same way
with respect to the great ends appointed for his race by
the Creator, whether knowing much or little of the
proportion which his single handiwork bears to the
great design.
Perhaps there is an error in our ordinary way of
contemplating human life. The egotism of man makes
the seventy years' span of the individual appear as of
the first consequence, and he naturally deplores the
brevity of the period, as with it begins and ends his
concern with this world. But the succession of gene-
rations is a determinate arrangement attending orga-
nised things, for which there must have been powerful
reasons in the councils of Omnipotence: continual
renewal, it may be surmised, is necessary for the
preservation of that portion of nature in a right and
efficient condition. The single life appears on this
view as an unimportant accident in the case. It might
be more just to contemplate the life of a species, or
even the life of all the species that were from first to
last to occupy any particular planet--an idea at which
we may well arrive after seeing it so amply demonstrated
by modern science - had such instruction not been
afforded through another channel-that both our own
species had a beginning, and there was a time (much
earlier) when this globe sustained no sort of living
thing. Undoubtedly, if we remove our contemplation
from the generation to the tribe or species, and think
of each of these as one existence, and see how long that
existence comparatively is, we must admit that the
frail creatures tenanting the earth come into a more
respectable relation to time than might have previously
occurred to our minds.
While we may be allowed to indulge in such specu-
lations-granting they be entitled to no better name-
it is very certain, on the other hand, that man's chief
business, as far as his present form of being is con-
cerned, is with the term of individual existence. Let
him stretch his soul backward into the farthest past, or
forward into the remotest future, still to this little space
on the Great Circle his thoughts must come home.
Here really dwell his Interests and his Duties. Here
must he approve himself a faithful servant of the great
Master, if ever. It is most interesting to contemplate,
as far as such a thing can be made objective, man going
through this little space of time, busy with a thousand
matters which seem to him of vast consequence, while
viewed in relation to the whole of time they would
sink into inappreciable trifles overlooking all this
their character in the grand relation, and rightly doing
so, since otherwise the business of the world-the
interests of the race at large-would be misconducted.
Small, indeed, are the concerns of many: the tilling of
an acre, the attending to some small part of a machine,
doing some little piece of service to a superior, repeated
in its trivial details every blessed day till the end; and
yet how fitting and well that such little matters are
not merely accomplished, but accomplished often with
a gusto and a spirit that redeems them from common-
place! The humble creature feels as if he were doing
great things for himself; and is he not really doing so,
when he is clearly taking the part assigned by his
While our contemplative connection with Time is
made so grand by our sense of the antiquity of things,
it must be admitted with a sigh that our actual or
practical connection with it-still limiting our consi-
derations to the present form of our being-is in some
measure rendered disheartening by the same cause.
When we think of humanity alone having lasted so
long, and only advanced as yet to the point which we
see, we become painfully aware of how small signifi-
cance and efficacy is a generation of our race. The life
of man was always seen to be a short-lived flower; but
now it becomes proportionably much more so than ever.
The most ardent seekers of reform and improvement are
thus taught how little they can expect to accomplish
in a lifetime, and how little of the results of their
endeavours they can hope to look upon with earthly
eyes. They take up the cause from others, and to
others it must be resigned. This has always been, to
a certain extent, known and admitted, and it involves
some elevated views of human nature; for is there not
something sublime in this zeal of working for results
by which others are to benefit? To continue diligent
in such working, when even more sensible of the short-capacity and the accidents of his birth in the great
ness of individual life in proportion to the great move-
ments of humanity, is so much the more grand. Not
that men can justly be said to work on such a disinte-
rested principle; but we know that in the very passions
they obey in their efforts to advance in that indefinite
improvability which forms the great distinguishing
feature of our race, and which has so often been misde-
scribed as perfectibility, they are under the guidance of
an Almighty Will which has arranged our destinies.
Clearer knowledge as to the duration of time will never
greatly alter the dispositions implanted in man. The
individual coral polype works for the building up of
plan which God has willed? There are also touching
views of time as regards the individual. It brings him
domestic changes, many of them sorrowful. Sometimes
he has a grief which he thinks can never be cured:
Time lays on his soothing hand, and the wound closes.
He cherishes a memory, and seeks to give it immor-
tality: the stone, though outlasting the feeling, forgets
its tale in twenty years, and no one can then say for
what it was raised. And yet who would wish to assure
a fellow-creature in the first burst of a righteous grief,
that in a few months or years it would be forgotten?-
or who would think of interposing to prevent that vain

the grief been felt and the affectionate recollection
expressed, and yet it is but in the few recent cases
that anything has been preserved. When the mourners
themselves have disappeared, who are to keep alive the
loss and the grief? What a grave of once-felt woes
and heart-breakings is the past! Still it is part of
nature that these things should be; and God, we may
be assured, looks with compassion on distresses of which
he knows the evanescence, and which by and by none

James Norton, having been hit grievously on the left
knee-cap, it was found necessary to take off the leg,
and the poor fellow sank under the operation. The
most energetic measures were, it may be supposed,
immediately adopted to bring the guilty parties to
justice. The government offered a large reward to
any one-excepting, of course, those who fired the fatal
shots that would give information leading to the
conviction of the offenders, and an active inquiry was
at once set on foot, and vigorously carried on throughout
the neighbourhood. The result was the apprehension
of a number of persons to whom suspicion pointed, and
the ultimate committal of five of them to the Winchester

last point the proof with regard to two or three of
them was by no means clear. From the blood-tracks

several of the county magistrates, to see a woman who
said she had an important communication to make to
me in private. This woman, a sightly person, with a
clear, healthy, open English look, though now overcast
with bitter grief, I had frequently seen before, and
knew her to be the wife of one of the prisoners,
Richard White by name, the youngest, and, as I
thought, the least implicated of them all. They kept,
I knew, a chandler's shop at Hythe, on the south shore
of the Southampton River, and just on the skirts of
the New Forest. But for one or two self-betraying
words dropped in the flurry caused by his sudden
apprehension, there was really nothing against him
except that he had been seen in close, covert discourse
with two of the other prisoners on the evening the
unfortunate collision took place. His wife, I found,
had been terribly scared by a remark of one of the
magistrates, and the instant we were alone, she asked
me with a hysterical whimper, if I really thought they
would hang Richard.

found, had been adjourned till the next day, when the

Mrs White again approached me, as, after a few
minutes' conference with the magistrates, I was leaving
the place. She was yet paler than before, but had
ceased whimpering; and there was a feverish light in
her eyes which I thought indicated that she had taken

be regretted for the victims' sake, was by no means to
be looked upon in the light of a common or deliberate
murder. This state of opinion of course branded the
expected betrayal of his comrades by Richard White as
a dastardly crime of the blackest dye; and when he
was brought up, a yell of execration burst forth which
completely unnerved him, and I greatly feared that the
necessary disclosures would not be made. As he was
passing the door of the waiting-room where his wife sat
cowering with shame and terror, he stepped eagerly
towards her, seized her almost fiercely by the hands,
and exclaimed in a shaking voice: I cannot do it,
Martha-I can't, and I wun't. The poor woman burst
into tears, and with a choking voice, as she clung round
his neck, urged him, though falteringly, to save his
own life-hers-that of their child. The pleadings
of the wife and mother were again successful - the
more easily, perhaps, that the hootings of the mob had
ceased, or at all events could not be heard where he
then stood. The prisoner was immediately conducted
before the magistrates, and I went in at the same time.
The chairman briefly assured him that if he should be
the means of bringing the men who actually slew Batley
and Norton to justice, there could be no doubt the
king's pardon would be extended to him. White
trembled very much while thus addressed, and his
changing countenance plainly shiewed how violent were
the conflicting impulses by which he was alternately
swayed and dominated. At last he spoke, but the first
faint, husky words were interrupted by the vehement
yet indistinct cry of a woman; and then his wife burst
into the room, wildly exclaiming: 'No, no, Richard
don't-not a word, for God's sake-not a word!' The

unexpected and remarkable opportunity of doing so
occurred.
"
I was fond of wild-fowl shooting, and occasionally
used to amuse myself with a duck-gun upon the South-
ampton Water, chiefly off Marchwood and Millbrook,
up towards Redbridge, where tolerable sport was fre-
quently to be found. One afternoon, when thus engaged,
accompanied by one of the cutter's crew, in a small
hired boat, it suddenly came on about half-past three
to snow furiously. I had gone rather high up the river,
and as the tide was flowing, the pull back to South-
ampton in such bitter and blinding weather was an
unpleasant and laborious one. I took an oar just to
keep myself from freezing, and we had reached off
Cracknor Hard, near Marchwood, when I caught sight
of a large boat, whose character and present occupation
could not be mistaken. She was about to creep up,
as it is called, a number of tubs sunk there under
adverse circumstances perhaps, or in order to their
being fished up and secured at the first favourable
opportunity. There could be no doubt with respect
to the business in hand, as I could distinctly see two
men, about two hundred yards apart on the shore,
waving their arms to shape the boat's course to
the exact spot where the tubs had been deposited.
The mode by which the contraband confederacy
manage to place a precise and the great point—
an invisible mark, where a boat or larger vessel may
find it prudent to sink her cargo, is simple and inge-
nious enough: two persons on shore, standing two or
three hundred yards apart-the boat or vessel being
about midway between them-first carefully mark the
places on which they stand, and

prive us of our witness. The woman's inflamed, disor-boat into line with the distant object to the point, in
dered aspect was perfectly maniacal; and the moment
she saw that White comprehended her meaning, away
she flew out of the room with the same wild hurry she
had exhibited on entering. The suddenness of the thing
took everybody completely by surprise, and excused the
fault of the constables in permitting her to approach
the prisoner. After the lapse of a few minutes White
was again asked if he had any statement to make:
'Only,' he doggedly answered, what I've said afore
that I am innocent of the sailors being shot, and mortal
sorry for it too!' Nothing further could be got out of
him. The angry and menacing warning of the chair-
man produced no impression; and finding both threats
and expostulations useless, White was finally committed
with the other prisoners, to take their trials at the
Hampshire assize on the charge of wilful murder. The
woman's extraordinary behaviour had been caused,
it was conjectured, by a communication made to her
by a seafaring man a minute or two after her husband
had gone into the justice-room. She had instantly, on
leaving the court-house, taken boat for Hythe.
Weeks wore away, and the month of January had
arrived without bringing any additional fact to light
in connection with the affair. In the meantime I had
been zealous and active in my vocation, but although
tolerably successful, not nearly so much so as I con-
ceived the many sources of private information I had
in various ways contrived to obtain, the carefully
arranged and boldly-executed schemes I had devised,
and the perseverance with which I followed them up,
entitled me to expect. The smuggling fraternity proved
keener hands than I had judged them to be, not unfre-
quently taking the wind suddenly out of my sails when
upon the most ingeniously-contrived tack, and at the
very moment I was hugging myself upon assured suc-

fact, where the line of sight of both mect and cross, and
the exact spot will be ascertained and reached. If
there be no opposite shore or distant fixed objects, the
operation is more difficult and uncertain, but to clever
and practised hands a star will suffice. This process
in trigonometry was now going on; and considering
that we were near the shore, and almost within call of
assistance that there were but five men in the boat, all
probably unarmed, whilst we had a loaded duck-gun
and a pair of double-barrelled pistols, which the fre-
quently sudden exigencies of the service had taught me
never to be without-and that, moreover, the Nelson
school in which I had graduated instructed its pupils
not to count adverse odds too curiously, I determined
to make one amongst them-two, rather, if the man
with me, who had only about a couple of months pre-
viously entered on board the Rose, should prove worth
anything, as of course I supposed he would.
Our two oars were at once unshipped; and first order-
ing the man to take the gun and lie close in the bow of
the boat, I seated myself at the stern, and sculled
quietly stem towards the smuggler. The atmosphere
was so thick k with the driving snow and fast-falling dark-
ness, and we glided so noiselessly through the water,
that I nothing doubted of closing unobserved with
the busy and preoccupied smuggler, when that rascal
Rawlings jumped suddenly to his feet, exclaiming in a
loud voice: They have mizzled, sir; let me help pull!'
and then seizing an oar without waiting for a reply,
he made a circle with it through the air, and let it fall
heavily into the row-lock. Sure enough they saw us
plainly enough now, and were off in a crack, and at a
speed which rendered pursuit both hopeless and absurd.
Rawlings, unable to face me, kept his eyes fixed in the
direction of the smuggler; and upon reflection I was
rather glad he did so, as my first impulsive movement,
with the half-formed intention of throwing him over-
board, had thereby, I thought, escaped his notice. A

rusty iron fender and poker. This was not, be it under-

'Now, then, Mrs White,' I said after a brief recog-
Inition, bear a hand, if you please, with whatever
communication you intend to favour me with. I trust
also,' I added, finding she did not answer so quickly as,
in my impatience, I thought she ought to have done,
'that you will keep this time a steady, straightforward
course, and not suddenly double and run off when least
expected to do so. You know what I mean?'
I do; and presently I will tell you why I acted so
strangely. I have now to inform you that the men
who are believed to have killed Batley and Norton are
within two miles of this spot. They are four-though
one, Tom Etheridge, need care little now for earthly
kings or justices. He is dying, if not already dead.
They were all wounded by pistol-shots. Three have
been for some time recovered, and to-morrow night
they quit the Forest, I think, for the Welsh coast, if
you permit them to do so."

If it depend on me, my good woman, you may be sure
that Winchester, not Wales, will be their destination.",
One of the cutter's men, Sam Rawlings, is a con-
federate of the smugglers.'
*
By Jupiter, I have thought so!' I interrupted.
The impudent rascal! But never mind, go ahead.'
The boat which he risked a good deal yesterday, he
says, to prevent falling into your hands, is that in
which they propose to take their departure, Rawlings
with them, who is determined not to trust himself again
on the deck of the Rose.'
He is right: but go on-who are the others?'
The chief of them is Daniel Squibb: you must have
heard of him.',
'Frequently, and always as a hardened, reckless
ruffian with whom the trade of smuggling is but an
occasional, and, compared with others he indulges in, a
respectable occupation.'
few moments restored my habitual self-restraint, and I
said as calmly as I could: They are off indeed, and
it is quite useless striving to overtake them. Do you
take both oars, and pull as quickly as you can to the
near steps of Southampton quay. He did so, and
presently bethought me of discharging the gun, since
there was no longer the chance of a shot either at ducks
or smugglers. It happened, I could not conceive how,
that the mouth of the barrel had become choked with
snow, and it consequently burst, about twelve inches
down, scattering the fragments in all directions. I was
unhurt, but Rawlings uttered a sharp cry of pain,
dropped the oars, and clapped his hands to his forehead.
A jagged piece of iron had struck him there, and the
wound, though I could see not at all a serious one, bled
profusely. He either was, however, or pretended to be
in great pain, and I determined on landing at Crack-
nor Hard, and getting the hurt looked to. This was
done. A Marchwood practitioner examined the wound,
stanched the hemorrhage, and jestingly remarking
how fortunate it was the iron had struck so slightly-
susceptible a part as the head, pronounced the injury
to be unimportant. This opinion the man did not at
all coincide with. He still appeared to suffer greatly,
and I agreed that he should sleep at the public-house
the only one there for that night at all events,
and if not quite restored, the next also; but to report
himself on board on the day following at the latest.
This arrangement effected, I walked to Hythe, and
there took boat for the Rose, then lying about three
miles farther down the river, very earnestly employed
the while in running up various trifling matters pre-
viously logged against Rawlings to a certainly signi-
ficant, though still perplexing sum-total. There was,
however, I did not doubt, a good time coming, an
and that
I determined patiently and very watchfully to await.
I had arranged to dine the next day and spend the
evening with my sister and a few friends; and accord-
ingly, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, I arrived
at Pear Tree Green. Important news awaited me.
Mrs White had been there in a state of great agitation,
to request that I would cross over to Hythe as soon
as it was dusk, where, on landing, I should be met
by a girl in a red shawl, who would conduct me to
her. It was necessary, she left word, that I should be
alone, and not in uniform, but well armed; and that
it would be advisable a strong party of the cutter's
men should be ordered to lie within hail off the Hythe
landing-place. Fortunately the boat which had brought
me to Itchen had not yet proceeded on its return, and
I immediately sent for the coxswain, Tom Sawley, a
man in whom I had entire confidence, and gave him
directions in accordance with Mrs White's suggestions.
I then swallowed a hasty dinner, changed my dress,
crossed over the ferry, and it being quite dark when I
reached the Southampton Quay, at once embarked in a
wherry for Hythe. A girl in a red shawl was, I found,
waiting on the Hard, and the instant I had landed,
she walked smartly away. I followed, and she led
on in the direction of Fawley. We had left the village
about half a mile behind us, when the girl gradually This very complimentary speech took me thoroughly

out knocking. There may be people watching us now,'
The cottage pointed out was about a couple of hundred
yards ahead, and there was no other habitation that I
could see near it. I walked on as the girl directed,
lifted the latch, and there, sure enough, stood Mrs
White alone, as pale as a spectre, and shaking with
nervous agitation. It was a wretched place, with a clay-
floor, and the only articles of furniture visible in the
dull light of a penny candle were a crazy three-clawed

That,' said the woman in a low voice and with a
perceptible shudder, is, I believe, quite true. The

ing the men, who no doubt by this time are off the

That cannot be,' promptly rejoined the woman in a
peremptory tone. That cannot be, Lieutenant Warne-
ford. You must first meet those desperate men alone.'
Alone! You must have lost your senses to propose
such a thing!'
'It would be no wonder if I had,' she sadly replied;
and I have no doubt that I shall do so if you fail me.

'No, no; but worse-far worse I fear, but that I

was to have told the magistrates where the men whose
names I have mentioned might be found?'
To be sure I do, and the fool's trick you caused him

Upon my word, Mrs White,' I said, 'you have

would go off to the entire satisfaction of everybody

principal part. Why not let the seamen approach, in
the first instance, within call of the fellows' hiding-hole?

be discovered, and the child would be at once massacred
out of revenge.' In short, she had such a multiplicity
of replies to all I could urge against the scheme, and
was so vehement in her entreaties, that seeing that it
was not an altogether desperate undertaking, and re-
membering how anxious the gentry at headquarters
were to secure the slayers of the two seamen, which
object could not be accomplished without Mrs White's
aid, I at last agreed to try the venture.
You give me your word of honour as a gentleman,'
said Mrs White, 'that after I have shewn you where
to find Squibb and his comrades you will not attack
them in any other mode than that upon which we have
agreed?' I gave the required pledge; the girl in the red
shawl, furnished with the necessary credentials, started
off to summon the men; and the instant they arrived we
made silently, in a zig-zag direction, towards Fawley,
keeping ourselves as much as possible within the shade
of the forest trees. After about twenty minutes' march
the men were halted, and Mrs White and I proceeded
alone.

He is still in Daniel Squibb's power, and should they
be attacked, the first victim would, I well know, be
my child. I have since ministered to their necessities
like a slave, in the hope that when they left the place
my boy would be restored. Yesterday I was told by
Squibb himself that he should, for fear of accidents,
take the child away with them; and if he does,'
exclaimed the unfortunate creature with a wild bitter-

and straw: the seamen must rush in at the large gates,

into a strain of pathetic and reproachful eloquence for

as it seemed-for I as yet hardly comprehended what
she was exactly driving at-of inducing me to sacrifice
my own life in order to afford her a chance, and a poor
one, of saving her son's!

sailors must stop at a spot within about three-quarters
of a mile of Squibb's and his companions' hiding-place.
You and I will go on. I shall enter the place with a
message from Rawlings, whom I saw about three hours
ago. They are without any light at nights; I can secretly
introduce you into the building, and place you in con-
cealment close to Squibb and the child. I will then return
for the men. We will approach as silently and swiftly
as possible, and when near you will hear this.' She
whistled a bar of a popular tune. It is their private
signal-whistle, and will not alarm them. When the rush
takes place, Squibb will endeavour to seize and slay
the child; but a brave and powerful man like you will
surely be able to shield the boy, even against all three
of the ruffians, during the very short time that will
elapse before they are completely overpowered?'
"
Having thus spoken Mrs White moved swiftly off,
leaving me, I must confess, in no very enviable state of
mind. Her scheme, ugly enough at first view, did any
thing but improve upon more intimate acquaintance,
and I had half a mind not to proceed further with it.
There were, it seemed, four sturdy ruffians, including
the look-out-now for the first time heard of-to
contend with; and should I be discovered before the
arrival of the seamen, the result could scarcely be pro-
blematical. Nevertheless, sustained by the professional
contempt of danger in which I had been reared, the
knowledge that I possessed remarkable skill with the
pistol, and the recollection of many perhaps greater
perils successfully overcome, I ventured on, and in
about ten minutes found myself close by the door at
the gable-end. So far all was well. I could hear a

slight affair-I placed my right foot softly upon one
of the lower rungs, which, the instant my weight was
fairly upon it, snapped short in the middle with a
loud crack. 'What's that?' cried one of the fellows
in a fierce voice, apparently a few inches only over-
head. It's me,' promptly replied Mrs White, who
was standing just without the door, listening in terri-
fied silence. Do you want me?' 'Not I,' returned
the surly savage; only mind you don't forget-for I
don't like your looks, as I told you that upon the

did you say Sam Rawlings would be here?'
6
About ten o'clock he said,' answered Mrs White.
A grunt of satisfaction was the only reply. The door
again closed, and I, with better fortune than before,
noiselessly ascended the crazy ladder. A small corner
of the floor, I found on reaching it, was partitioned off
from the rest, as Mrs White had stated, by trusses of
hay and straw, behind which I crawled, and after a
while contrived to get a view of the amiable party to
whom I found myself in such dangerous proximity.
The moon shone brilliantly in upon them, and I could
see their features distinctly. They were all dressed
and armed with pistols stuck in their waist - belts.
The great brawny figure of Daniel Squibb was
stretched upon a heap of straw, covered by some dirty
blanketing, and by his side lay a young child-fast
asleep, I thought, judging by the natural ease and
grace of his reclining posture. Two others, Stokes and
Withers, were sitting half up in similar beds, and
farther on lay a fourth. It required but one look at
the white, rigid, pinched features, and open blindly-
staring eyes, to recognise it as the recently-deceased,
untended corpse of Etheridge, whom I had frequently
seen. Excepting frequent pulls at the black bottles,
one of which stood by the side of each of the living
men, there was nothing done or said for some time.
At last Squibb, happening to look in the direction of
the dead body, said with a half shudder: Throw a
blanket over the face, Harry; it ain't pleasant to look
upon, 'specially just now.'
'It's a good thing though,' resumed Squibb, after
another suck at the brandy bottle- it's a good thing
he's gone. We can be off now without any fear of
leaving him to peach upon us. But for that we might
have mizzled two or three weeks ago.'
6
•
'Ay, Matey,' replied Withers, that's true, but I
misdoubt Mother White.'
So do I; but this young fellow here will keep her
within bounds. She don't seem to have any notion
that we are off to-night.'
'I don't think,' said Withers; and the trio relapsed
into silence, broken only by the glug glug of the liquor
they swallowed, as it glided out of the necks of the
bottles down their seasoned and unslakable throats.
Mrs White expected to return with the men in about
half an hour; but that time had long past, and still
they came not. I was becoming feverishly impatient,
when the signal-whistle was heard, instantly replied to
by the look-out in the loft above.
'Who can this be?' said Squibb. 'It's not time for
Rawlings yet, according to Mrs White.'
The three fellows rose and listened anxiously, and
I observed Squibb take a pistol from his belt and
cock it.
The look-out man now made his appearance. 'It's
only Rawlings,' he said.
'All right!' echoed Squibb, evidently greatly relieved,
and returning the pistol to its place.
Presently I heard footsteps approaching by the way
I had entered. The only thing apparently now to be
done was to sell my life as dearly as I could, and I
collected myself in the dark corner where I was shrouded
for that purpose. The new-comer stepped briskly up;
and without pausing to look round, made his way over
the hay and straw to his friends.
'You are early, Sam,' remarked Squibb. 'White's
wife said you would not be here till ten o'clock.'
'I wasn't going to tell her exactly when I was
coming or we were going.'
'All right!' interjected Squibb with an approving
nod.
'Dick Hessel's boat will be off Luttrell's Folly at
twelve o'clock to-night precisely,' added Mr Rawlings.
"That's capital, Sam!' replied the chief of the gang.
And you, I suppose, mean to shove off with us?'
"That I do indeed. The skipper smells a rat, and I
shall be brought up with a round turn when least
expected or desired if I don't make myself scarce, now
I have an opportunity.'
'I should like to catch that Mr Warneford,' said
Squibb with a bitter, venemous accent, and his blood-
shot eyes, inflamed with drink, sparkled with deadly
ferocity-'I should like to catch that fellow within a
couple or so of yards of this little barker'-and he
again drew forth and flourished a long pistol-' some
fine night with nobody but ourselves within sight or
hearing, and if I didn't drill a neat hole through his
canister, it would be a pity, that's all.' The other
fellows savagely coincided in Squibb's pleasant aspira-
tion.
'It was a bold stroke entering on board the Rose,'
continued Rawlings; but it's getting much too risky
now, so that- Hollo!-who's that, I wonder?'
It was a repetition of the signal-whistle, and, judging
by the tremulous weakness with which it was given, I
guessed by whom. The five fellows-for the look-out
had not returned to his perch-became rigid and
breathless with eager attention. The whistling was
repeated. That's Martha White,' said Squibb: 'what
but mischief can bring her here again?' He then
grasped the little boy, who had been for some time
awake, with fierce violence by the hair. 'Dare to
whimper,' he said in low, deadly tones, 'or breathe
louder than usual-only dare!'
'Lend me a back,' said one of the fellows, 'that I
may look out at the window.'
Hark!' cried Squibb. 'There is some one unlock-
ing the front gate. Who should that be?
Look over
the stairs, Stokes-quick! quick! By all the devils,
if it be, as I suspect, I will blow this imp's brains out
whatever be the consequence-quick!' and the ruth-
less savage held the muzzle of the pistol within six
inches of the head of the boy, who seemed dumb with
terror.
I hesitated for a moment how to act. To shew my-
self, and rush upon the scoundrel, would in all proba-
bility precipitate the child's fate, Squibb now being at
a distance of four or five yards from me. Adopting
another expedient, in full reliance upon my oft-tried
skill and coolness, I took deliberate aim at the ruffian's
head, steadying my arm upon a haytruss, and waiting
only to be sure as to who the new-comers were.
6
6
Who is it?' again fiercely demanded Squibb.
Speak, will you?'
"Betrayed!' shricked Stokes. The coast-guard are
upon us!'
As the first syllable left the man's lips I fired. The
report was followed by a frightful yell from Squibb.
The bullet had struck his right jaw and broken it.
He whirled round with the sudden agony, and the
pistol in his hand dropped harmlessly on the floor.
The next moment all was uproar, confusion, and dis-
may-the loud shouts of the sailors, the frenzied screams
of the woman, and the maledictions of the smugglers,
who, after a vain show of resistance, essayed to escape
by the way I had entered, mingling in deafening uproar
and confusion. They were all secured except Raw-
lings, who contrived to escape; and very luckily for
him that he did so, or unquestionably the reward for

RAMBLES IN SEARCH OF WILD-FLOWERS.
A BEAMING July day, which in many an inland place
would have been far too hot to admit of exercise, but
which was rendered delightful by the invigorating influ-
ence of the sea-breeze, was that which I selected for
a view of the bogs in their summer beauty; yet although
the said sea-breeze had wonderful effect in mitigating
the heat of the atmosphere, I thought it wise to keep
still during the early hours of the day, and not to start
on my expedition until after an early dinner. I also
considered that the pleasure of my ramble would be
enhanced if I indulged myself with a donkey to take
me to the scene of action, so that I might not arrive
there fagged and heated by a rather over-long walk,
and thereby in some degree unfitted for making the
serious attack which I meditated on the treasures of
the bog. Behold me, then, at about four o'clock, with
my botanical case slung to the pommel of my saddle,
and my donkey-boy armed with a basket and trowel,
for the purpose of securing any roots I might wish
to get, and with my mind full of cheerful visions of
coming pleasure, setting forth on my expedition, I
chose the shady lanes through Knowle, considering that
by so doing we should be less exposed to the rays
of the sun, and proposing to return by the heathy hills
when the cool air of the evening would be streaming
over them.
Our course lay through a succession of true 'Devon-
shire lanes; lanes which are so devious, and lead into
each other in such a manner that you may not unfre-
quently, after walking for, an hour, find yourself at the
very point from which you set out. We, however, were
no novices, and made no false turnings. Passing through
a deep cut in the red sandstone rock, high banks of
which-clothed at intervals with hawthorns and other
plants and flowering shrubs, and on which I am told the
apple-moss (Bartramia pomiformis) grows-rising on
each hand, and the sand lying so deep under foot as to
make it difficult to get on, we at last entered on a
verdant lane, and fell on the course of the most limpid
of brooks, some five or six feet wide, along the side of
which-but, alas! the side out of our reach-stood a
rank of most noble foxgloves (Digitalis purpurea), hang-
ing their spotted purple bells over the water, mixed
with groups of elegant ferns, some erect, others droop-
ing and feathering the edge of the stream with their
graceful verdure, the whole array, so beautiful that I
My first discovery of Daleage was merely accidental,
for I had never heard that such a place existed. I was
riding over the hill, when a sudden turn in the by
road I was pursuing brought the lovely little spot into
sight. Just before me lay a small patch of richly-
wooded ground, the trees in their full spring verdure,
and under their shadow stood a group of picturesque
cottages, with all the usual adjuncts of labourers resting
at their doors, surrounded by their children cows as-
sembled for milking, &c. &e. It was quite a Gains-
borough scene. Above the little orchard which flanked
the cottages lay a sort of petty tarn, overhung by beau-
tiful trees. I found, on a nearer view, that this was in
fact merely the brook widened, and forming a milldam,
around the edges of which wild-flowers had congre-
gated, apparently undisturbed for ages. From this
dam flowed the brook whose course I had been follow-
ing, which, after passing through the village of Bud-
leigh Salterton, eventually joined the sea just opposite
my cottage. What a treasure is a clear-flowing brook!
From its little spring-head, where the peasant fills his
water-can, or waters his flock, on it flows over rock,
bog, or plain, through wood and wild, to the fair mea-
dows, which become fairer from its reviving presence.
As it widens, it becomes perhaps a harbour for the
speckled trout and other fish, which tempts the angler
to linger bencath those noble oaks and elms which
grace its border; and then it ripples in a slow shallow
stream over the pebbles and stones which obstruct its
course, forming a pleasant and safe place for the cot-
tage children to dabble with their bare feet, and to swim
their little boats. A little farther on it may extend
itself into a dam, and turn the mill-wheel, thus benefit-
ing the whole district through which it passes; and
after affording to many a rustic family a bountiful
supply of that element so needful to life and comfort,
on it goes, its banks ever fringed with flowers, and its
course marked by its fertilising influences, straight on
its appointed course to the river or sea, which is its
ultimate destination, exhibiting as it flows a striking
emblem of the course of a quiet, healthy-minded Chris-
tian, walking in his appointed path, and striving to do
good to all around him, his unobtrusive life noticeable
only from the marks of usefulness and the kindly
charities which flow out on all within the sphere of his
influence.

The brook-side and the hill are all a maze of flowers,
and the bog a perfect paradise of dainty devices. So
I leave Jack, my donkey, to browse among the fern
leaves, and in defiance of mud, make my way down to
the water's edge. But oh the disappointment I expe-
rience on finding that the flowers which looked so
temptingly attainable are all ensconced behind an edge
of black bog, mud, and water! There is the beautiful
bog-bean (Menyanthes trifoliatum), with its great trefoil
leaves, and lovely fringed blossoms by the hundred, all

I found, on my return home, that it was the marsh St
John's wort (Hypericum elodes), a plant by no means
common even in bogs, to which it is entirely confined.
The whole tribe of the Hypericineæ, of which I hope
hereafter to give a general sketch, is very interesting to
me; but the Hypericum clodes, though on examination
evidently a true scion of the stock, does not at first
sight seem to bear the characteristic marks of that
tribe. One of my next discoveries was the pretty
lesser scullcap (Scutellaria minor), which though by
no means so handsome as its congener, Scutellerius
galericulata, is an elegant little labiate plant, and by no
means common. Its height is from four to six inches,
the flowers of a pale-reddish purple, and the lower lip
white, dotted with red. The common scullcap grows
about a foot high, and the flowers, which are much
longer than that of S. minor, are of a bright-purplish
blue. It is exceedingly pretty. The concave form of
the upper lip of both species, which much resembles
that of the monk's-hood, seems to have suggested the

separate footstalk, and arranged on a common flower

leaf. The leaves are ternate, or divided into three
leaflets, which are slightly toothed, and both in colour
and texture, though not in form, resembling those of
the common broad bean. The flower-stalks rise from
ten to fourteen or sixteen inches in height, and the leaf-
stalks are nearly as long, but not so upright in their
growth. The plants are gregarious; and where they
grow at all, they spread freely, forming large groups,
the roots being so densely matted as even sometimes to
render firm the ground of the bog where they grow.

main business of the hour-that of collecting. But
was I not collecting? I was indeed-not plants, but
thoughts! treasures of thought on which to fall back
at an aftertime; and pictures-not such as I could
hang on my walls, but those which would adorn my
mind and memory. I was collecting from the song of
birds and the murmur of the water, from the scent of
flowers and the beauties of sunshine and shade, of hill,
and vale, and tree, rich hoards of thought, and grateful
remembrance, which have since cheered and refreshed

But my reveries were disturbed by George, who came

soon recalled me to my botanical self. Among other
things-some of interest, and others worthless-he dis-
played a noble handful of the beautiful and delicate
butterfly orchis (Habenaria bifolia.) It was not my
first introduction to this interesting plant, which is not
confined to bogs, but may be found also in woods. But
as many of my readers may not know it, and as it grew
in this bog in greater profusion than is common, I will
venture to give its characteristics; and in so doing I
shall be obliged to enlarge a little on those of the whole
of that wonderful and curious tribe, the orchidea.
6
lands these glorious flowers are seen in all their beauty;
and, seated on the branches of living trees, or resting
among the decayed bark of fallen trees, or running
over mossy rocks, or hanging above the head of the
admiring traveller, suspended from the arm of some
monarch of the forest, they develop flowers of the
gayest colours and the most varied forms, and often
fill the woods at night with their mild and deli-
cate fragrance.' Humboldt says: "The orchidea en-
liven the clefts of the wildest rocks, and the trunks
of tropical trees blackened by excess of heat. This
form, to which the vanilla belongs, is distinguished by
its bright-green succulent leaves, and by its flowers of
many colours and strange and curious shape, some-
times resembling that of winged insects and sometimes
that of the birds, which are attracted by the honey
vessels. Such is their number and variety, that to
mention only a limited district, the entire life of a
painter would be too short for the delineation of all
the magnificent orchidea which adorn the recesses of
the deep valleys of the Andes of Peru.' Klotzsch
reckoned 3545 species of this wonderful family as
known at the close of 1848, and doubtless multitudes
more have since been discovered. But though this
tribe is so varied and attractive in form and scent, it
possesses, I believe, but few species which are of the
slightest use to man. One is the vanilla, which is
used to flavour creams, &c. and which is a pod of a
kind which, in the West Indies, creeps like ivy on
walls and trees; and there is one other, the shoemaker
plant (Cyrptopodium Andersonii), whose stems afford
a gluten which the Brazilians use for sticking thin
sheets of leather together. Still, the tribe is most in-
teresting indeed.
The leading peculiarity of the orchis tribe is, that its
column consists of a stamen, a style, and a stigma, all
grown into one solid body. The anther is formed of
two vertical cells, in each of which is a mass of pollen;
the style is thick and short; and the stigma a shining,
moist depression in front, under or between the masses
of pollen. The genera vary exceedingly in the struc-
ture of the different parts, but in the consolidation of
the style and stamen they are agreed, and this forms
the characteristic of the orchis tribe. The arrange
ment of the sepals of the calyx and the petals of the
corolla are so very singular as to leave it doubtful to a
common observer which is which; and these parts are
in many of the species so disposed as to assume the
form of some animal or insect. In England we have
not above sixteen varieties of the true orchis; but the
ophrys, which is of the same natural order, has many
of the same peculiarities of form and character-the
leading difference between the two genera being, that
in the orchis the nectary is elongated into a tubular
spur, of which the ophrys is devoid. Many of our
most curious insectivorous flowers, which are called
orchises, belong, in fact, to this genus. The beautiful
-bee orchis (Ophrys apifera), the fly orchis (Ophrys
muscifera), the late and early spider orchises (O. arach-long loose spike of large yellowish-green flowers of wax-
nites and O. aranifera), and the drone orchis (Ophrys
fucifera), all of which are more or less rare, belong
to the genus ophrys; whilst the monkey, the lizard,
and the frog (Orchis tephrosanthus, O. hercing, and
O. viridis), belong to the orchis family. The Ace-
ras antropophora, or green-man orchis, though closely
allied to the orchis, is not one. Its corolla when spread
out closely resembles the human form, whence its
name. Then there is the elegant little flower Neottia
spiralis, the ladies' tresses,' which also ranks among
this extensive tribe: this may be found in August and
September, its straight and leafless stem rising abruptly
from the earth, with its small, highly-scented flowers,
of a greenish hue, disposed on short footstalks spirally
along the upper part of the stem. The curious lis-
teras,' or 'tway blades,' are congeners, and well de-
serving notice, as are many others of the tribe, which
we cannot now notice specifically, but among which
are some of the brightest ornaments of our fields and
woods in spring and summer, and also some of the
most lusciously-scented of those which regale our sense
of smell. In foreign countries the orchis tribe is far
more extensive and wonderful than in our own colder
climate. In Europe, the species all grow on the ground
in meadows or marshes, hills or woods; but in tropical
The glowing descriptions which we meet with in
books of this family of plants would almost be enough
to lead one to abandon the comforts of home, and roam
in distant lands for the mere purpose of realising such
wonders. But even in England it is a glorious tribe.
Though many of the species of the orchideous family
may be more curious than that of which I first spoke,
the Habenaria bifolia, there is, I think, none more truly
elegant and attractive. By Linnæus and others it is
called Orchis bifolia, but by Hooker and other modern
botanists Habenaria bifolia. The root of this plant is
an undivided tuber tapering downwards; the stem in
general from twelve to eighteen inches high, though I
have seen it in moist woods exceeding two feet: it has
two root-leaves of a long-shaped oval, from between
which rises a semitransparent stem, crowned with a
like texture and very peculiar form. The lip of the
nectary is lance-shaped, and not more than half as long
as a threadlike tubular spur which hangs down behind
the blossom, and gives it its peculiar character. The
sepals of the calyx, which are of the same pale-greenish
hue as the petals, spread downwards, and the complete
corolla has somewhat the form of a small butterfly; its
insectivorous appearance is not, however, so marked as
that of the fly and bee orchises, some specimens of
which might really deceive one into the idea that the
blossom was a fly or bee pitched on a stalk. I never
see the butterfly orchis without being reminded by it of
some tall fair girl, whose growth has overshot her
strength, and whose fragile form indicates a fear that
she is not long for earth. Another of the characteristics
of this sweet flower may tend to carry out the illusion,
and happy for the fading girl if it is indeed found in
her. When the sun goes down, and the shades of
evening descend, this flower throws out from its pale
blossom a fragrance so rich and powerful as to pervade
the whole air for a considerable distance. So have I
seen a fair young creature, when the shades of sick-
ness were spreading round her, and the bright things
of earth were fading from her sight, pour out from
some hidden source a sort of moral fragrance in the

atmosphere which surrounded her sick couch, making
all who breathed it feel that she was more precious
to them, and her influence more refreshing to their
souls in those twilight hours of existence, than she had
ever been in the bright sunlight of her more vigorous
life-even as that sweet evening-scented flower has a
greater value when its perfumes are poured forth on
the night than when its daylight colours delight the
eye. And whence comes this sweet influence? Whence
the patience, and meekness, and gentleness, the spirit of
love and holiness, which, like sweet dropping balms or
Eastern gums, thus impregnate the moral atmosphere of
the sick bed with soul-subduing fragrance? Surely it
can only be from the influence of God's Holy Spirit
dwelling in the heart, and imparting to it of the nature
of Him whose very name is 'as ointment poured out!'
The rarer kinds of orchis are not to be found near
Budleigh Salterton, at least I have never seen any of
them there except Orchis pyramidalis, which is rare in
some places. Those I have found are, Orchis mascula,
O. maculata, O. morio, O. pyramidalis, O. latifolia, and
O. conopsea. Nor have I found any other of the orchi-
deous family there except the ladies' tresses (Neottia
spiralis.) The bee orchis abounds on the more western
parts of the coast, and I shall not soon forget the
delight I have felt in seeing a whole hillside as thickly
covered with this beautiful little flower as I have seen
fields with cowslips. I had large handfuls gathered
for me, and my vases filled with them for two or three
succeeding summers, without seeming to lessen the
multitudes which sprung up in every direction; but such
profusion is not common, a scattered gleaning being
all that can be had in any locality I at present know.
Before I left the bog, I found fine specimens of
Alisma ranunculoides, the lesser water-plantain, with its
pale, purple tripetalous blossoms, which is not common,
and many other specimens of interest, but, warned
by the lengthened shadows, I now bethought me of
returning homewards. Setting my boy, therefore, to
catch Master Jack, who appeared by no means to relish
leaving his pleasant browsing, I retreated to one of the
cottages, and after obtaining leave to change my bog-
stained shoes and stockings for some dry and clean sub-
stitutes which I had brought with me, and obtaining a
piece of brown bread and a cup of milk (from the cows
whom I had seen assembled for milking) for myself,
and another for George, I set forward on my homeward
road; but not over the hill, as too much time had been
already expended to leave sufficient for me to botanise
its heaths and other produce. I therefore return by
the lanes, only crossing the little rivulet, which now
meets me again. I rejoin the high road at a point a
little farther from the village than that at which I had
left it; and in so doing I pass a little triangular spot
of ground, presenting one of those strangely-arbitrary
arrangements which all conversant with the habits of
plants occasionally observe. This spot of ground is only
separated from the little enclosure where I found the
Equisetum sylvaticum (as mentioned in a former paper)
by a mere belt of wood, and the soil, &c. appears to be
cxactly of the same character as in that enclosure; yet
here, throughout the year, I find scarcely one flower
similar to those which grow there: there are in it no
orchises nor polygala-neither hyacinths, equisetum,
nor potentillas; the only thing which abounds there is
the lovely blue forget-me-not (Myosotis palustris), a plant
wholly unknown to the little enclosure where the above
so enamel the ground! These arbitrary arrangements
are very common, though to me wholly inexplicable.
I have known rich banks of violets in one field, whilst
in the next, apparently exactly similar in soil and
aspect, not one was to be found; a circuit of fields
golden with cowslips, whilst one poor, solitary field lay
between, in which not a single root could be found;
and so with other flowers. But I linger too long, and
the rising moon admonishes me that it is high time to
hasten forward and get home; so, sending Jack into
something like a trot, I make my way down the vil-
lage, now all alive with those just released from
business, and seeking the sweet, cool evening air, and
arrive safe, though tired, at my cottage door.
EMIGRANT SHIP
WASHINGTON.'
IN describing lately the excellent accommodations on
board certain vessels bound for the Canterbury Settle-
ment in New Zealand, we alluded to the wretched
treatment occasionally experienced in emigrant ships
from Liverpool and other ports to America. It is
proper to remove any doubts that may be entertained
on this subject. A notion prevails that the government
emigration officers-one of whom is stationed at each
principal port-protect the interests of passengers, and
generally save them from being ill-treated during their
voyage. It is nevertheless clear, that in spite of the
interference of these functionaries, and also in defiance
of strict legal enactments, passengers of a humble class
are on many occasions treated with extreme barbarity.
It is indeed sickening to reflect on the discomforts,
misery, pain, and even premature death, arising from
no other cause than the brutality of officers command-
ing emigrant vessels. Unfortunately, the misconduct
of these persons is in some instances beyond the juris-
diction of English law. They sail under a foreign flag,
and can be proceeded against only in the courts of their
own country: in which case there may be said to
be a complete denial of justice; for what emigrant, on
arriving at his destination, will take the trouble and
be at the expense of waiting months, perhaps years, to
prosecute a delinquent skipper?
One of the worst cases of this kind which has come
into public notice is that lately detailed in a Return to
the House of Commons, ordered 19th February 1851,
respecting the emigrant ship Washington. Drawing
our information from this parliamentary paper, the
following is the account of the affair:-
-
Mr Vere Foster, a person of respectable character,
who appears to be engaged in the shipment of emigrants,
had heard numerous accounts of the improper treatment
of passengers to America, and to satisfy himself as to
their truth, took the extraordinary step of becoming
himself a steerage passenger in a vessel sailing under
the American flag bound for New York from Liverpool.
The ship was the Washington—a remarkably fine vessel
of 1600 tons burthen, with two good passenger decks,
each between seven and eight feet high, and well-
appointed in every respect. Her crew consisted of
thirty-one men, three boys, and five officers-namely,
the captain and four mates and she had on board
upwards of 900 passengers, whose sleeping berths were
a shelf along each side of the whole length of the two
decks, with low boards dividing the shelf into berths all
of one size, and each containing from four to six persons.
One end of the upper deck was divided off as a sepa-
rate apartment, containing twelve enclosed cabins, each
having two, four, or six berths, and each berth containing
two persons. The passengers in this part of the vessel
paid a somewhat higher price-namely, L.5 instead of
L.3, 15s. or L.4. Mr Foster occupied one of four berths
in a cabin of this kind. Each passenger in the ship
had a contract-ticket, in which certain provisions
were stipulated for, with a supply of water daily, and
right of cooking. Some extra provisions, which cost
10s. 6d., were taken on board by Mr Foster and his
companions in the cabin. All things being nearly
ready for departure, the passengers were inspected by
a surgeon, and ordered on board. We shall now allow
Mr Foster to tell his own tale, which he does in a
letter to Lord Hobart, dated Ship Washington, 1st
December 1850:'-
6
'All the passengers who arrive at Liverpool a day or
more before the sailing of an emigrant ship have to be

inspected by a surgeon appointed by government, who
will not allow any one to go on board who has any
infectious disease of a dangerous character. I passed
before him for inspection, which occupied only one or
two seconds. He said without drawing breath: "What's
your name?
Are you well? Hold out your tongue:
all right; and then addressed himself to the next
person. We were again all mustered and passed before
him on board the ship while sailing down the river.
There was no regularity or decency observed with
regard to taking the passengers on board the ship: men
and women were pulled in, any side or end foremost,
like so many bundles. I was getting myself in as
quickly and dexterously as I could, when I was laid
hold of by the legs and pulled in, falling head foremost
down upon the deck, and the next man was pulled
down upon the top of me. I was some minutes before
I recovered my hat, which was crushed as flat as a pan-
cake. The porters, in their treatment of passengers
(naturally), look only to getting as much money as they
possibly can from them in the shortest space of time,
and heap upon them all kinds of filthy and blasphemous
abuse, there being no police regulations, and the officers
of the ship taking the lead in the ill-treatment of the
passengers.
"
The Washington went out of dock on the 25th [Oct.],
and anchored in the river. I went on board on the
next day, and witnessed the first occasion of giving out
the daily allowance of water to the passengers, in doing
which there was no regularity: the whole 900 and odd
passengers were called forward at once to receive their
water, which was pumped out into their cans from
barrels on deck. The serving out of the water was
twice capriciously stopped by the mates of the ship, who,
during the whole time, without any provocation, cursed
and abused, and cuffed and kicked the passengers and
their tin cans; and having served out water to about
thirty persons, in two separate times, said they would
give no more water out till the next morning, and kept
their word. I gently remonstrated with one of the
mates, who was cuffing and kicking the poor steerage
passengers, observing to him that such treatment was
highly improper and unmanly, and that he would save
himself a great deal of trouble and annoyance, and
win, instead of alienating, the hearts of the passengers,
if he would avoid foul language and brutal treatment,
and use civil treatment, and institute regularity in
the serving out of the water, &c.; but he, in reply,
said that he would knock me down if I said another
word. I was happy to find, however, that my rebuke
had the effect of checking for the moment his bullying
conduct.
to hold four persons, and would conveniently hold five
persons; sone of the berths had four persons in them,
and some as many as six. I observed that the doctor
noted down in many instances persons between the ages
of fourteen and sixteen as under fourteen-that is, as
not adults, although it is expressly stated in our tickets
that fourteen years of age constitutes an adult, and any
one above that age is paid for extra as such. This was
for the purpose of making a saving in the issuing of
provisions, as half rations only are served out to
passengers under fourteen years of age. The doctor
remarked to me at the time, that as regarded the issuing
of provisions, sixteen years of age was considered on
board the Washington as constituting an adult.
On the 30th October no provisions had yet been
served out, and the complaints of the poorer passengers
in the steerage were naturally increasing, as they had
no means of living, excepting on the charity of those
who had brought extra provisions. [At the request of
the passengers Mr Foster drew up a letter to the
captain, representing the ill-treatment from want of
provisions. This letter, however, only produced a few
savage words in reply, and the writer of it was called a
rascal and a pirate for interfering. At length, on the
31st of October, provisions were issued; and Mr Foster,
on weighing various rations, found them deficient.]
'On Saturday, 2d November, groceries were issued
for the first instead of the second time to the passen-
gers: the six persons in my cabin received all their
provisions together. We got 6 oz. of tea instead of
12 oz.; nearly our proper allowance of sugar; and 14 lb,
of molasses instead of 3 lbs.; and no vinegar. We have
as yet received no pork, though we should have received
our second weekly allowance of pork to-day.
'On Thursday, 7th November, flour, biscuits, oatmeal,
and rice were issued in the same proportion as before,
excepting that the flour was a little under the allow-
ance. I was looking on during nearly the whole of the
time, and could see that the quantities were the same
to each person. The six persons in my cabin received
8 lbs. of oatmeal instead of 30 lbs.; 8 lbs. of flour
instead of 6 lbs.; 8 lbs. of rice instead of 12 lbs.; 83
Ibs. of biscuits instead of 15 lbs.
On Saturday, the 9th November, an allowance of
pork was issued for the first instead of the third time:
the six persons in my cabin got 6 lbs. When one of
the occupants of berth No. 180 came up for his pork,
not knowing that another man from the same berth
had just received for the whole of its occupants, the
first mate instantly ran at him, and hit him with his
clenched fist, and with a rope's end, about the face and
head, and then added: If any other
annoys
'Provisions were not served out this day, notwith-me,
standing the engagement contained in our contract-
tickets, and notwithstanding that all the passengers
were now on board, the most of them since yesterday,
and had no means of communication with the shore,
and that many of them, being very poor, had entirely
relied upon the faithful observance of the promises
contained in their tickets, the price of which includes
payment for the weekly allowance of provisions.
While a steamer towed the Washington down the
river on Sunday, 27th October, all the passengers were
mustered on deck, and answered to their names as they
were called over by the chief clerk of the agency-office
at Liverpool. This formality was for the purpose of
ascertaining that there was no one on board but such
as had tickets. One little boy was found hid, having
made his way on board, thinking to escape notice: he
was sent ashore. On the 28th we were so fortunate as
to have a most favourable breeze, which carried us out
of the Irish Channel, being that part of the voyage in
which we expected the greatest delay.
'On the 29th I went the round of the lower deck with
the surgeon of the ship, observing him take down the
numbers in each berth. These berths are constructed
I'll smash his head for him!" Whenever
provisions are served out, a sailor stands by with a
rope's end, and capriciously lays about him, with or
without the slightest provocation. The captain never
appears to trouble himself in the slightest degree about
the passengers, nor even ever to visit the part of the
ship occupied by them. The first and second mates,
the surgeon, and the man specially appointed to look
after the passengers, and the cooks-all these very
seldom open their lips without prefacing what they
may have to say with horrible oaths.
I hear occasionally some of the passengers complain
to the first mate or to the captain of the favouritism
shewn by the passengers' cooks to those who give them
money or whisky, and who consequently get five or
six meals cooked daily, while those poor passengers
who have not the money to give, or who do not give,
are kept the whole day waiting to have one meal
cooked, or can have only one meal cooked every second
day. In my own case, on one of the first mornings of
my being on board, the cook took up my kettle of
water, which had been waiting one hour and a half to
be put on the fire, and said to me: "What are you
going to give me to cook that for you?" I replied

saying: That fellow is not going to pay up, so

for the voyage, and a great many do so. I did not, for
I wished to place myself as much as I conveniently
could in the same position as the general run of my
fellow-passengers. I find now, that either in conse-
quence of good words in my favour from some of those
passengers whom I have had small opportunities of
being of service to, or in consequence of an appreciation
of my fairness in taking my proper turns though I
am well able to pay for doing otherwise o or of my

22d.-The gale became perfectly terrific; for a few
minutes we all expected momentarily to go to the
bottom, for the sea, which was foaming and rolling
extremely high, burst upon the deck with a great crash,
which
was stove in. The wave rushed down into the lower
deck, and I certainly expected every moment to go
down. Some of the passengers set to praying; the
wind blew a perfect hurricane, so that it was quite out
of the question to attempt to proceed on our proper
course. We therefore scudded before the wind, having
up the main-topsail close reefed and the fore-topsail
staysail only. The water which had rushed upon the
deck remained there to the depth of several feet; it
was got rid of by breaking holes in the bulwarks with
a hatchet. The whole sea was a sheet of foam. Towards
nine P. M. the gale began to be less, though still violent,

will be the last; and some of them express an opinion
that the first and second mates will get a good thrashing
at New York.
⚫ 14th.-Provisions of oatmeal, biscuit, flour, and rice,
were issued this day as usual. I weighed what was
given to four adults and a boy occupying one of the
stecrage berths. They received 10 lbs oatmeal
instead of 223 lbs. due; 43 lbs. of biscuits instead of
11 lbs. due; 4 lbs. of flour instead of 4 Ibs, due; 5
Ibs. of rice instead of 9 lbs. due.
17th. I heard the doctor say: "There are a hun-
dred cases of dysentery in the ship, which will all turn
to cholera; and I swear that I will not go amongst
them: if they want medicines, they must come to me!"
This morning the first mate took it into his head to
play the hose upon the passengers, drenching them
from head to foot; the fourth mate did the same a few
mornings ago.
HOTE
18th. A three-masted vessel in sight, going in the
same direction as ourselves; this is the second vessel
only that we have seen since leaving Liverpool. About
noon a heavy squall came on, which split the fore-top-
sail and staysail.
A delicate old man, named John M'Corcoran, of
berth
just 111, informed me that on Sunday last he had
one
on deck, and, after washing, was wringing a
pair of stockings, when the first mate gave him such a
severe kick as he was stooping, that he threw him down
upon the deck.
A
passenger, having a family with him, told me that
of the first days after coming on board the doctor
applied to for a present, saying, that of course he
his services to the passengers, but that to
those persons who liked to give him anything, of course
he should pay more particular attention: the passenger
then gave him 2s. 6d. He applied in the same manner
to Mr Homer, of cabin No. 8, who gave him 1s. The
doctor then said: "And there was that glass of castor
oil of the other day, for which you owe me Gd.," which
Mr H. then gave him. The doctor has no right to
charge for any medicines, but has, I am told, received
a great deal of money on board in the same way. The
first mate beat one of the sailors severely this evening

mate; and to display his autho-
rity, drew himself up and swelled himself out exces-
sively tremendous, roaring out: "Now, then, clean and
wash out your rooms every one of you!" adding the
most horrible oaths.
2d December. A beautiful day and a favourable
breeze; took a pilot on board.
Many of the passengers have, at different times
during the voyage, expressed to me their intention of
making a public complaint respecting their ill-treat-
ment on board this ship; so, to meet their wishes, I
wrote a few lines, which were signed this evening by
128 persons.

3d.-A few of the passengers were taken ashore to
the hospital at Staten Island, and we arrived alongside
the quay at New York this afternoon. The 900 pas-
sengers dispersed as usual among the various fleecing-
houses, to be partially or entirely disabled for pursuing
their travels into the interior in search of employment.
6th.-I met this day with some friends of mine, who
came out two months ago in the Atlas, with 415
passengers. They describe the treatment of the pas-
sengers on board that vessel by the officers as con-
siderably worse than what I have related respecting
the Washington.
2
'I have since met with passengers whom I sent out
in the Washington on her previous voyage, and I learn
from them that no provisions were served out during
the first fortnight of her voyage, and that no meat was
served out during the whole of her voyage: I have also
met with passengers whom I sent in the Wm. Rathbone,
whose, treatment by the officers and as regards provi
sions was similar. It is one of the same line of packets.
Here follows a comparison of the provisions due,
and, the provisions received by cach passenger during
our voyage of thirty-seven days, shewing a great
deficiency."
The foregoing statement, as has been said, formed
the subject of a letter to Lord Hobart, the writer of it
remaining in the meanwhile in America. Lord Hobart
transmitted Mr Foster's letter to the Colonial Land
and Emigration Commissioners, who instituted inquiries
at Liverpool through the government emigration officer
at that port. The result, as it appears, was--that there
could be no redress. Legal proceedings against the
captain of the Washington at New York had been con-

now I see two of the bars have disappeared-a fact
which, taken in connection with the appearance of the
skin, is a sufficient proof that a serpent must have got
in. I wish you to advise me how to get the intruder
captured and killed.'
templated by Mr Foster; but he was dissuaded, on
account of the delay and expense of doing so. Under
these circumstances, the commissioners apprehend that
nothing now can be done until at least the arrival of
Mr Foster in England; and even if he should then be
prepared to take proceedings against the officers of the
ship, it seems very doubtful whether any English court
would have jurisdiction in the matter.
Sahib,' replied the Baboo, 'I could do that readily
enough; but allow your old servant, a worshipper of
Sheeva, to intercede for an animal he holds sacred. I
see very well that this is the skin of a kurait, com-
paratively a harmless snake. It has no stamp of the
spectacles on its nose. That snake, Sahib, will prove a
good genius: he came to seek your protection, and has
laid his skin at your door to tell you so. Take me as
bail for once, and rest assured that, instead of doing
you harm, he will clear your room of those disgusting
toads and frogs which sometimes jump upon your feet
at dusk, and will devour the mice which eat Missy
Baba's gingerbread, and kill also the musk-rats, of
which she has such a horror.'
Supposing Mr Foster's statement to be correct and
we have seen no cause to doubt its accuracy-it is
evident that the humbler class of emigrants on board
certain vessels are exposed to the grossest misusage
without the slightest practicable remedy in law. On
this account the press can but do its duty in spreading
a knowledge of the fact, and in recommending emigrants
to exercise all reasonable caution in arranging for their
passage. One thing more might possibly be done:
at each principal port a number of respectable and
benevolently-disposed persons might form themselves
into an association to investigate the trustworthiness of
advertisements addressed to emigrants, and to recom-
mend no emigrant to make an engagement with any
shipping concern without previously communicating
with the association. Some such organisation might
perhaps bring refractory and selfish skippers to their
senses.
"Oh, papa!' cried I, looking imploringly in my father's
face; think of those horrid musk-rats that go shrieking
like evil spirits at night through our bedrooms, and
spoil everything in our pantry and cellars-even the
wine, which is carefully sealed with wax and rosin!
Let us by all means leave the serpent alone, to deal
with them as he pleases.' My father could not help
smiling.
'Well, Baboo,' said he, 'I will for once take your
bail, and also allow Christina's eloquent appeal to soften
my heart-so let the snake live.'
We neither heard nor saw anything more of the
intruder for about twelve months, but found, as the
Baboo had prognosticated, a vast diminution in all the
vermin kind; when another skin, prettier than the
former, but nearly double its size, was found laid
upon the same spot. The Baboo was sent for again in
a hurry.
'Ah Sahib,' said he, addressing my dear father, my
good genius, I fear, is now about to take his departure.
He is grown restless, and is gone to seek for a partner;
and as his old skin was grown painfully tight, he has
slipped it off by making a rent on the top of his head.
See how ingeniously he has hooked it against that
slight roughness on one of those little iron bars.'
SNAKES AND SNAKE-CATCHERS.
THE snake with its tail in its mouth, in Egypt a
symbol of eternity, is in India a simple fact. In that
country the circle embraces both heaven and earth; it
sweeps through the whole mythology, from Mahadeo, the
god of the Serpent, and Doorga, his consort, decked
with coils of snakes instead of chains and jewels, to
the hundred-headed snake who bears the lord of the
universe, and the monster whose task it is to churn
the waters of immortality. This mythological series
descends upon the mountains and forests to the north
of India, where it becomes the Dhorah- -a mighty
reptile fifteen feet long, and thick in proportion, which
our Old Indian has seen carried on the shoulders of
several men in procession. Thence rolls the serpent-
fold, in every kind of variety, over the fields and gar-
dens, through the houses, in the bath, in the scullery
and store-room, in the very bed, till it comprehends
the whole circle of Hindoo life.
'I am glad,' said my father, 'to hear that you think
the snake has taken his departure. We shall say no
more about him then, and I shall have those bars
replaced, to prevent any of his congeners from getting
into his lodgings.'
This was done, and snakes were almost forgotten,
except at such times as we looked at our pretty cast-off
skins, until one morning our poulterer made his appear-
ance with a woful countenance and a low salaam.
'Khodawund,' said he, folding his hands, the
pigeons will not come down from their perches to-day
to eat, and the rabbits have hidden themselves in their
hutches.'
Well do I remember, quoth she, the commotion
which the finding of a small snake's skin occasioned in
our family circle. We children-alas! I was then a
child-could not enough admire its transparent tex-
ture, the regularity of its scales, and its smooth and
glossy appearance; and our wonder increased as we
observed how dexterously the skin must have been
slipped off, just as Juliet might have withdrawn from
her smooth hand the glove that Romeo wished to be.
Thus uninjured the shining skin lay before us-a small
slit alone indicating where the wearer of this beautiful
integument had crept out. After our excitement and
admiration had somewhat abated, I perceived my dear
old father's countenance become somewhat clouded,
And what is that owing to, my good man?' asked
my father.
'Khodawund, I suppose a snake must have frightened
them last night, and if you order an investigation, the
sheitan' (satan)-for the poulterer was a Mohammedan
-will be found lurking about the premises. Suppose
we get a real snake-catcher, and not one of those pagie
(mean fellows), with their gourd flutes, and have peace
restored in my department?'
'Miaghan,' cried he at last to the servant in waiting,
'call Hurreckchund Baboo;' an intelligent individual,
who was often taken into our cabinet councils, and
who was much esteemed for his urbanity and upright-
ness. Well, Baboo,' said my father, as soon as the
old man made his appearance, 'do you know that I am
harbouring a snake and these children under the same
roof?'
"
How is that, Sahib?' said the Baboo; this must
have come to pass very recently.'
'By all means,' replied my father; and a bona fide
snake-catcher soon made his appearance.
Black as a coal was the skin, frizzled, woolly, and
crisp the hair, and flat and ill-favoured the counte-
nance of this Bugdee, obviously a man of the lowest
caste. Such countenances are found in all the ancient
Hindoo excavations, and they grin and goggle from the
shoulders of all the gigantic idols of olden time. The
present olive-coloured, straight-haired Hindoo seems
to be of a different race from the excavators of the
'Well, look at this skin; it was found early this

of the flute, till his charmer, with great dexterity,
seized him, and deposited him in the basket. Two
other snakes were caught in nearly the same manner,
the last being minus an eye, which of course attracted
our notice.
Sir, here we shall find the snake.'
'What is to be done now?' asked my father.
'We must dig, sir, if you have no objection.'
My father had none, and as he was anxious to have
the enemy caught, operations were begun immediately.
The hole was considerably widened, and after the man
had dug about three feet deep, sure enough an immense
gokhooral (cobra de capella) was seen coiled up.
C
'Oh,' said the man, there he is! I know from his
beautiful purple coat, shining scales, and his whole
appearance, that he is the dhemorah (the gentleman
snake.) Now, shall I seize him?'
As soon as he had uttered these words the snake, as
if understanding to what his discourse tended, spread out
his frightful head, with the well-known marks of spec-
tacles, and made a dart at the man with his beak-like
mouth. The Bugdee avoided the dart, watched his
opportunity, and seized the snake by the back of the
neck, upon which the monster coiled itself in many
folds round and round his muscular arm.
That water-jar-quick, quick!' cried the man.
"This fellow will paralyse my limbs. Away with him
into the pot! I may not slay him, for if I did the gods
would never allow me to capture another.' The snake
disappeared in the pot, the mouth of the vessel was
covered firmly with a piece of cloth, and a stone fitted
close upon it.
'Now,' said the man, 'we shall dig a little farther,
and no doubt discover the female, and find also either
her eggs or her young.
And so it proved. A few strokes with the spade
brought the female snake to light. She was of a much
paler colour than the male, and not nearly so large.
Having had a good feast on the pigeons during the
night, she was rather sluggish, and sat brooding upon
three eggs almost asleep. The snake-catcher pounced
upon her as he did upon the other without much
ceremony; and having squeezed her so tightly by the
neck as to make her open her jaws, he displayed to us
her horrible fangs. The eggs were of a dirty white
colour; and upon being broken, they exhibited the

translating books, but articles-by sending through the
Italian mind that common current of reflection and
information which is the very life of the English intel-
lect. In the introduction the editors, one bearing an
Italian, the other a Scottish name-the Chevalier Se-
bastiano Fenzi and James Montgomery Stuart-remark,
that England alone has been exempt from the almost
general fate of Europe-to struggle for freedom-to
seem to win the fight for a moment-and then to fall
back, having gained nothing more than a shadow. It
seems to them that the achievement of liberty is useless
without the capacity to enjoy it in an orderly manner;
and that the best preparation Italy can make is to
study the popular literature of a nation possessing so
eminently this capacity, and offering so excellent a
point d'appui for those who would develop the elements
of Italian society.
Chinese enumerate five each.' The work, it will be
seen, is conceived in a wise and healthy spirit, and if
even tolerable in the execution, Dr Macgowan will
deserve well of China and of mankind.
The third literary production is the first number of
an English newspaper, published under peculiar cir-
cumstances at the antipodes. In September last, our
readers are aware, four emigrant ships sailed from this
country with the view of founding the Canterbury
Settlement in New Zealand. It was late in December
before these pilgrim fathers arrived at their destination
-an uninhabited bay surrounded by a desert; but here,
on the 11th of the ensuing month-before twenty human
habitations were in existence-appeared the 'Lyttleton
Times,' a well-printed paper of twenty-four columns
folio, with its page of advertisements, its leading article,
its notices to correspondents, its shipping news, its local
intelligence, its poets' corner, its market prices, and
its police report. Formerly, it used to be said that
wherever the English went, the first thing they did was
to establish a tavern: now we have changed all that-
the chief necessary is a newspaper, and the stirring
character of the age demands, above all things, expres-
sion. We wish every success to the Lyttleton Times,'
and to the settlement of which it aspires to be the
organ.
Under these convictions, they propose that the new
journal shall be composed of such translations from
English periodicals as will give a faithful reflection
of the existing state of art, science, literature, and
social life in England; and they invite the sympathy
and support of the Italian public to an undertaking
which they believe will not only furnish a useful and
agreeable volume, but serve to correct prejudices and
remove antipathies. Their materials will consist of
narratives, articles on physical and natural science,
machinery, &c.; travels and geographical sketches,
literature and art, &c.; besides an original review ofA
English works relating to Italy. The contents of the
first fasciculus now before us are as follows:-' Adven-
tures in the Fiord,' by Harriet Martineau; "Terrestrial
Magnetism,' from Chambers's Edinburgh Journal;
'Foreign Reminiscences of the late Lord Holland,'
from the Edinburgh Review; Herschel's 'Siberia and
California,' from the Quarterly Review; and a review
of Ogilvy's Traditions of Tuscany,' in verse, with
poetical translations of the extracts.
This undertaking we think is worthy of all encou-
ragement; and we are quite of the opinion expressed
by the editors, that a free interchange of thought is
still more important than a free commercial intercourse
between nations.
The second work alluded to is published at Ningpo.
It is of a narrow folio size, neatly stitched as a pamphlet,
with a thin cover of yellow silk. It is entitled the
Philosophical Almanac,' by D. J. Macgowan, M.D.,
and is printed in Chinese, with numerous diagrams, in
the 48th year of the 75th cycle of sixty, or 4488, being
the 1st year of the reign of H. I. M. Hien Fung.'
The main object of the work is to communicate to
the Chinese a knowledge of the principles of the electric
telegraph; and as an introduction to the subject-
necessary to them-there are added essays on electri-
city, galvanism, and magnetism. But this indoctri-
nation has no reference to the establishment of an
electric communication with Peking; the benefit it
seeks is intellectual, not physical; and the fluid of
thought it conveys is intended to awaken the Chinese
mind from the torpor of ages.
To this ancient people their ancestors are deities, to
whom they pay divine honours; and it is necessary to
prove to them that in the course of the last 2000 years
the world has learned something, and that we of these
last days are in some respects wiser than Confucius.
This must be the foundation of all teaching in China,
where at present it is unlawful for the human mind to
advance one jot beyond the wisdom of their ancestors.
The decomposing power of the galvanic battery is
explained, the author tells us, for the purpose of
shewing the fallacy of so much of the philosophy and
mythology as is connected with the theory of the five
elements reference being also made to facts in astro-
nomy, optics, chemistry, and anatomy, which in like
manner scatter to the winds their notions relative to
planets, colours, metals, and viscera, of which the

there appears to be no place amidst the busy haunts of
men. Sometimes in clambering along these pathless
highlands, where one might almost forget that there is a
populous world to be returned to, I have been surprised
at the appeal made by even a little wild-flower, when,

must confess that my predominant feeling is one of
deep interest in the contemplation of the mechanism

two precipitous fronts. I swiftly traversed the upland
moor, and bending towards the left, came in about half
an hour to the brink of what I believed to be the oppo-
site precipice, although in the scenery below I vainly
endeavoured to recognise the country which I had left at
mid-day. With great difficulty I descended a rough corry
for four or five hundred feet, and then became aware that
I had made a mistake, and was only returning to the
valley at the back of the hill. It was now between
six and seven o'clock, and my strength was much dimi-
nished; yet as there was nothing else to depend upon for
getting home, an exertion must be made. With incre-
upon the table-land, the form of which, by the aid of
my pocket compass, I now understood. Feeling unfit
to encounter any more ascents, I declined an adjacent
hollow in the summit which might have given a
miles along the moor in order to turn the flank of the
straighter way home, and walked for about a couple of
mountain; thus at length completing my original
design. At that point there was a splendid look-out
upon the outer portions of Loch Broom and its many
islands, over which the sun was beginning to go down;
but no habitation met my eye: I had still the sense of
being far from human aid and succour. There was in

remembered the shepherd's house was situated, but it

refreshing succours. It is when thus thrown forth from
the social scene, and left exposed to the merciless
energies of physical nature, that man feels how weak he
absolutely is, and how, without some ultimate trust in
the Almighty source of his being, that being is but as
a straw upon a whirlpool. I am unwilling to treat my
adventure in an exaggerating spirit; it was, after all,
perhaps, only remarkable as an unusual occurrence in
the life of one accustomed to dwell amidst the comforts
of the highest civilisation. But since I am relating it
to all, I feel that I ought not to suppress some reference
to the solemn feelings which passed through my breast

death.
smooth abraded rock, interspersed with a meagre vege-
tation. In the distance lay Ben Goalish and the other
mountains of the two Loch Brooms, a scene of
unbroken sterility and grandeur; while it was just
possible in the middle ground to obtain a peep of the
softer scenery around that bay to which I would so
fain have returned. For some time I passed along the
sheep-tracks on the face of the mountain, descending
Joccasionally from one to another, till at length it
occurred to me that I might fail to surmount the
frontier hills, and that it was best to try to turn their
flanks by keeping near the sea. I therefore left the
front of Benmore proper, and, crossing the stream in
the trough or valley below, passed obliquely up the
opposite ridge. In due time I came to the extremity
near the sea, but found it appallingly steep and appa-
rently impassable. I was on the verge of a precipice,
all but impending over the restless element, which,
even on this comparatively calm night, kept up a con-
tintal roar below. In the state of exhaustion to which
I was reduced, and the desperate aspect which the case
was assuming, I felt for a moment that to have fallen
over these cliffs and been at rest in the bosom of the
deep would have been less of a calamity than such an
event usually appears. At this crisis, however, a ray
of hope shone forth, for I espied a small footpath
passing along the face of the cliff underneath. A foot-
path must lead from one human haunt to another. In
one direction it would probably take me to the shep-me. It was but for a moment that this appearance

By this time it was half-past eight o'clock, and I felt
an attenuation and languor not to be described. It
may here be explained that walking over such a
district is a very different kind of exertion from that
of promenading in a street or a country road. From
the roughness of the ground, it is necessary to leap, to
clamber, to slide, and thus the whole system is strained
and shaken to a degree which in a few hours tells
-severely upon it. Under such violent exercise, perspi-
ration, streams from the body, and drops from the hair

from anxiety, I felt as on the borders of a fever. What
1. helped to strengthen this impression was the raging
thirst which I experienced. At every one of the nume-
rous rills of pure water which crossed my path, I took
two or three handfuls, and yet the drought was never
in the lenst quenched. I recollect at that time collecting
a few crumbs from my satchell and trying to eat them,
when it appeared as if the salivary glands had been
utterly dried up, for the bolus remained dry and
unswallowable in my mouth until I obtained a little
water to slake it.
1 By doubling back a little way-how hard a doubling
back appears at such a time!-I reached the footpath,
› which proved one of fearful difficulty, sometimes passing
up little precipices, sometimes crossing little morasses,
I almost always, ascending, for it soon appeared that
much high ground was still to be passed over. I was
now able to walk only forty or fifty yards at a time.
At the end of every such space, I lay down, or involun-
tarily tumbled down on the heath, and remained there
a few minutes to recover breath and strength. Twice
or thrice a flash of sleep, as I may call it, passed over
my exhausted powers, each having its little momentary
dream; a phenomenon very interesting, but also very
alarming, as to have fallen completely asleep in such
circumstances would probably have been fatal. I
remember reflecting at one of those intervals of rest, of
what value would have been a bottle of wine and a
biscuit-how much even a bowl of milk would have
been worth! I felt too that, if a bottle of wine
could have been obtained, the first impulse of nature
would have been to drink it off at one draught.
Some large portion of one's entire means in life
might willingly have been rendered for one of those

and in the fifty-eighth parallel of latitude, the sun for-
tunately kept above the horizon till about nine o'clock.
At a different season of the year, darkness supervening
at an earlier hour, I certainly could not have escaped.
It was now past nine, and the light was beginning to
wane - an addition of no small magnitude to my
anxieties, but at the same time a stimulus to the jaded
faculties. It was at this time that, casting my eyes
over the gray rocks everywhere surrounding me, a
curious deception of vision for a moment occurred.
Methought I saw two human figures standing motion-
less on the hill above me. They seemed like a man
and his wife, and appeared to gaze calmly down upon

gaze at the spot, to ascertain if there really were any
living beings so near me. In the excited feeling of the
moment, my mind reverted to superstitious tales which
speak of the spirits of those who may be presumed to
feel the greatest interest in us, making an appearance
before us at times of extraordinary peril. On a search-
ing examination of the spot, it quickly appeared that
the figures were merely the effect of some peculiar
form and colouring of the cliffs. The footpath, after
being twice or thrice lost in bogs of fresh vegetation,
or over crags where I failed to mark its course,
became finally untraceable, and I had then to move
as I best could over ground encumbered with large
blocks and masses of moss, guided only by my general
sense of the form of the country. I thought I could not
then be far from the desired place of rest, but feared to
believe it, knowing how apt a stranger is to be deceived
in his estimates of a hitherto untrodden district. At
length, on succeeding with great difficulty in surmount-
ing a considerable steep, I attained the face of the hill,
whence I could see the shepherd's house below. My
troubles were at an end. I reached the door of that
humble mansion at precisely ten o'clock, having been
engaged in violent exercise, without adequate support
to the system, for fully nine hours.
I found that the man had gone home with the pony
in despair of my taking that mode of returning; but
the shepherd and his wife proved as ministering angels.
They gave me food and rest, with every demonstration
of sympathising kindness, and sent me home to Ulla-
pool next morning greatly recruited, though I did not
feel quite recovered for three days. My worthy hostess
at the village had been in such concern for me, that she
was about to have had a search instituted, when fortu-
nately my reappearance saved her the trouble.
Some years ago, when rambling with a few geological
friends in North Wales, I used to join in the laugh at
the Snowdon guides, who were sure to ply you with
what they called 'frightful examples' of the danger of
ascending that mountain without a guide. But I begin
to think that frightful examples are not quite to be
laughed at. I am also beginning to suspect that geology
is a somewhat rough study for a gentleman on the
borders of fifty, and that I must leave it to younger
men, and look with more respect upon the quiet walk
or safe fireside. There must first, however, be some

A WORD ON PIANOFORTES.
THE pianoforte is the most popular musical instrument
of the day. The facility with which a very respectable
amount of skill in performing upon it may be attained,
and its admirable adaptation for an accompaniment
to the human voice, have contributed to render it a
general favourite. It is to be regretted, however, that
much ignorance prevails with regard to the constitu-
tion of a piece of mechanism now so generally to be
met within our domestic circles, and that so little
caution or judgment is exercised in the selection, and
so little care in the treatment of it. From what we
observe in the houses of our friends and neighbours, or
wherever we go to enjoy a musical treat, we see that
information on the subject is almost universally
wanting, and that a serious waste of money is con-
tinually occurring from heedless precipitancy in the
purchase and subsequent neglect in the treatment of
pianofortes. With the view of obviating these evils, in
some degree at least, the following few facts and sug
gestions are submitted to the consideration of all whom
they may concern.'t of the in sidia
And first, as to the choice of an instrument for
family use. There is no question that the grand
piano, both in regard to durability and power, is at
present the most perfect form of the instrument.
Taking into consideration the actual cost of manu-
facture, it ought also to be relatively the cheapest,
instead of being, as it is, the dearest instrument.
The high price, with the shamefully enormous profits
it includes, is only maintained through the limited
demanda demand which is never likely to become
very general, owing to want of space in our dwell
ings for the convenient stowage of a mass pre-emi-
nently unwieldy and unsightly, notwithstanding all the
artistic talent that has been put in requisition for its
ornamentation. The upright piano, under which term
may be included all sizes, from the tall cabinet to the
dwarf piccolo, is fast superseding both the grand and
the square for family use; and in consequence of the
increased, demand, more improvements have been made
in the manufacture of instruments of this description
than in any others. But whatever description of instru
ment may be chosen, considerable caution is necessary,
especially if economy is to be kept in view, in making
the purchase. There are certain well-known names
which have stood high in the profession for many years,
and if the intending purchaser have not sufficient
judgment of his own, and no friend upon whose judge
ment he can rely, he cannot do very wrong in pur
chasing of one of these long-established firms, with
whom it may be said with some degree of truth, that
a bad instrument is the exception, and not the rule.
But in this case he will inevitably pay for his
own satisfaction the price which the makersset
upon their reputation, plus the value of the instru-
ment. But it is by no means the case that all the
skill in the manufacture of pianofortes is monopolised
by the great names. Admirable instruments are daily
put forth by men of small repute, quite equal in all
imaginable respects to those of the most renowned
manufacturers, and which may be bought by those who
have skill to select at a fair and reasonable price, yet
yielding a good profit to the makers.
As a general rule, a piano for family use should be one
of the simplest construction. If it be constructed on
sound mechanical principles, it ought to be strong
enough to bear the tension of a good thick wire
throughout, without the cumbrous addition of steel,
bars and plates of metal, and hollow copper tubes, such
6
additions being for the most part nothing better than
so many costly catchpemies, which serve the double
purpose of enhancing the price of the article and
cloaking the ignorance of the manufacturer, who is not
unfrequently driven to have recourse to them from a
deficiency in knowledge of the true principles of his art!
For domestic use a piano of moderately crisp touch is to
be preferred--not one offering no resistance to the finger,
by the use of which a slovenly and ineffective style of
performance would be engendered, nor one on the other
hand that demands a momentum of five or six pounds
per key to elicit the full force of the note. The present
practice of banging upon the key-board with a vigour
which would astonisha pauper engaged in the com
paratively easy occupation of breaking stones upon the!
road, has compelled the manufacturers to protect the
reputation of their instruments by mechanically dini-
nishing, by the operation of various contrivances, the
momentum of the hammer which strikes the string.

performer it once was; the united force of arins and
shoulders is brought into play; the rigidly distended
digits are displayed aloft and dashed down upon the
keys with a savage furor altogether out of keeping with
the sentiment of music and song; and all the while
the enthusiastic performer imagines that by the display
of such antics, and the cost of so much perspirationa
he is eliciting the fine qualities of his instrument,
and never dreaming that his superfluous labour is
wasted in overcoming the resistance of so much lead or
leverage, which the manufacturer has erected as a
barrier to his destructive propensities. How far this
senseless system is to be carried there is no saying, or
whether it will be thought necessary by and by for a
young lady to go through a course of gymnastics as a
previous qualification for the study of music, or a littler
preparatory exercise at a blacksmith's anvila (One)
thing is certain the manufacturers have the best of
the rivalry, and can, if they like, adapt their pianos to
the fisticuffs of an Aniazon without the additional cost

With regard to the tone of the instrument to be
selected for purchase, any written instruction would
be of little service. To tone, in the proper sense of the
term, the pianoforte indeed has no claim. To In this!
respect an experienced ear is the best guide and the
taste of the purchaser, who should be aware that loud
ness is not always the best quality, may influence the
selection. In

· There is one thing yet to be said with regard to the
purchase of a pianoforte, and that is, that it should-be
inade with the maker himself, or with some well-known
respectable and accredited agent of the maker. It is
not generally known that something precisely analogous
to the copying of pictures, and palming them off as
originals, is carried on upon a large scale in the manu
facture of cheap and so-called second-hand pianos.
Copies of instruments bearing the names of the first-
rate manufacturers, put together by men out of work,
or unwilling to work at journey work, are planted
about in all directions, as well in the metropolis as in
other large towns. Drapers, hatters, losiers, glovers,)
hairdressers, milliners, and a host of others, have pianos!
to sell the property of a lady who has left town ;'
and a vast number of middlemen, who advertise daily
in the London papers, drive a thriving trade by the
sale of false and spurious pianofortes, made by untaught
bunglers at the cost of from L.10 to 1.15, and sold at
a profit of cent. per cent. as the second-hand goods
of the most eminent manufacturers. Some of these
middlemen in a large way of business assume a very
high standing, and affect the pretensions of unquestion
able integrity-giving warranties with their goods, the
only advantage of which is that at the end of six
months, if not satisfied, you may change a bad bar-
gain for a worse. Cabinet-makers, too, have taken to

shrinking and wearing away of the leather from fric

broken between the key and the hammer which strikes
the strings the hopper having to traverse the space
lost through shrinking and wear, and striking the lower
end of the conducting rod with an audible blow. The
buffing or baize, moreover, upon which the keys rest,
also shrinks and hardens from the same causes, and
thus it frequently happens that an instrument which is
hardly used at all becomes unfit for use through the
ignorance or negligence of the owner. Other injuries
of a similar nature ensue from the same causes, which
it is not necessary to mention heretis true all this
would occur in the course of years under the best ma
nagement, and even with the best instruments; but
in careless hands this inevitable deterioration will be
accomplished in fewer months than it would in years
of prudent care. The best place, then, for the piano in
the parlour or drawing-room is assuredly somewhere
away from the current of air that runs constantly from
the door to the window. In a recess on either side
of the fireplace, or against the wall fronting the win
dows, or in some position the least liable to atmospheric
currents, is the best place, as well for the instrument as
for the performerijo 'to teor a bin gromillion 2194entais
An instrument that will keep in tune is, however,
after all, the grand desideratum. This, in the present
state of our knowledge on the subject, is unattainable;
although, an approach to something like it may be
secured by the exercise of a little care and prudent
expenditure in the outset. All who have paid any
attention to the phenomena of strained steel wires
know that there is a tendency in a wire which has long
been strained to a certain pitch to remain at that pitch,
and even to return to it, on towards it, if suddenly
altered. Thus if you tune a wire sharper than it
should be say a quarter of a note, by way of experi-
ment, and keep it up to that pitch for a fortnight, and
It is greatly to be regretted that pianos are as yet
far too expensive for general use among the humbler
classes. With the present mode of manufacture there
seems no immediate prospect of improvement in this
particular. As yet every part of the mechanism, as
well as the exterior fabric, is made by hand, and then
put together by finishers, who work for high wages,
and spend an immense amount of time, pretty much at
their own discretion, inchipping, shaving, adjusting,
and regulating, to apparently very little purpose; the
major part of which tedious and expensive ceremony
might be abolished, at least in the production of
instruments for popular use, by the adoption of a simple
uniform plan of construction, carried out with the
precision which the use of machinery in the fabrication
of the different parts would ensure. But the magic
power of machinery dias never yet been brought to
bear upon this department of manufacture; and the
wonder is, seeing that large and princely fortunes are
annuallymade through the great and increasing
demand for these instruments, that such is the case.
There seems no reason why a pianoforte should not be
as cheap as a clock. The mechanism of the one ought
not be more expensive than that of the other; and the
adjustment and regulation of both are perhaps of about
equal difficulty. The great cause of the difference in
the cost of the two is doubtless that while the clock is
made very much by the means of machinery, the piano
is entirely the produce of manual labour.
In connection with pianofortés, a word or two may
be allowed in regard to the despised old harpsichords,
thousands of which are yet extant, and are occa-
sionally offered for sale at prices less than the value
of the cases that contain them. Let their possessors
pause before they deliver them to be broken up it
is not generally known that they may be converted
into charming instruments at the cost of a few shillings,
and the exercise of a little ingenuity and labour. The
following extract from the writer's musical experience
may be of use to some possessor of a harpsichord dis-
posed to repeat his experiment. 155

though she by no means admired it; and being a pretty
girl of twenty, and moreover an only child, it may be
supposed that she was much indulged and petted. She
was, indeed, her worthy father's darling and delight; and
well did Lucy repay his affection by her dutiful conduct
and forbearance: for Mrs Borradaile was her step-
mother, and not more than fifteen years Lucy's senior.
It was to this lady's love of show and decoration that
Otterton Cottage owed its flaunting appendages: she
having a weakness for everything that seemed to her to
savour of gentility, and an unwearied desire to approach
patrician usages and patrician society in general.
She had been married to Mr Borradaile for ten years,
and was still a really attractive woman, and would have
been yet more so, had not a mincing gait and studied
manner, meant to be particularly easy, detracted from
her charms. Her little fortune of five hundred pounds
had been safely lodged at the local bank by Mr Bor-
radaile, when he made the winsome Nelly Peel his
second wife; but to hear Nelly talk of her fortune
it was under her own especial control and at her abso-
lute disposal-one would have imagined that twice five
thousand at least was in the bank. However, Mrs
Borradaile romanced about my own money'-and a
marvellous long way it must have gone certainly to
procure so many substantial luxuries and comforts of
all descriptions; and if Mr Borradaile ever refused to
gratify any whim or caprice-which, kind soul! was
rare indeed-then Mrs Borradaile whimperingly de-
clared: it was hard, with her fortune, that she could
not do as she liked.'
A quarter of a century ago, having an old harpsi-
chord in my chamber, I resolved, at the suggestion of a
friend, to convert it if possible into a sustaining instru-
ment for the performance of slow music. This inten-
tion was accomplished in the following manner:-By
means of a common treddle, somewhat similar to that
of the travelling knife-grinder, and, like that, worked
by one foot, a stout silken thread was made to revolve
round the whole of the strings horizontally. This
thread had been previously well soaked in resin dis-
solved in spirits of wine, and thus qualified to act as
does the bow of a violin upon the strings. It must be
remembered, that in the harpsichord the two strings
which are in unison are throughout separated by
wider spaces than the other-just the reverse of what
is the case with pianofortes. This wide interval gives
room for the jacks' to play up and down; and each
jack being furnished with a slip of quill on either side,
twangs both the strings in unison as it rises from the
pressure of the key. Having cut away the quills from
the jacks, I made a small inverted arch in the top of
each, large enough to allow of the revolution of a small
brass wheel about the diameter of a pea, and grooved
at the edge for the reception of the silk thread. The
wheels were turned from a stair-rod by a watchmaker
for a trifling charge; and the axles upon which they
revolved were short stout needles inserted in holes
carefully drilled through the centres of the sides of the
arches. By this contrivance, whenever the jack rose
by the touch of the finger on the key, the small wheel
rose between the strings, and pressed the resined
thread (revolving horizontally by the action of the
treddle) against both the strings, producing a tone
resembling nothing so much as that of the Eolian
harp, and capable of increase or diminution by the sole
pressure of the finger on the key. It answered admir-
ably for very slow music, but hung fire so much that
any attempt at a moderately-rapid passage produced
no sound at all. For chants and andante movements Mr Borradaile had made his money in trade--a cir-

OTTERTON COTTAGE.
In a picturesque Devonshire village, situated on the
banks of the river Otter-which, after playing all sorts
of vagaries hereabouts, quietly debouches into the sea
at a few miles' distance-resided, some score of years
ago, an elderly gentleman named Borradaile, with his
wife and daughter. Otterton Cottage, Mr Borradaile's
abode, was the mansion of the neighbourhood. Highly
ornamented both within and without, it arrested the
gaze of the passer-by, who, according to taste, viewed
it with an air of approbation or otherwise. The simple
country-folks pronounced it a rare fine place,' and
Madam Borradaile a rare fine lady;' and they spoke
the truth, for both the domain and its mistress were
as fine and full of pretension, lacking real merit, as
unskilful hands and foolish heads could make them.
Sweet Lucy Borradaile was very fond of her home,
6
Your fortune, Nelly, my dear!? would her husband
good-humouredly exclaim: why sure it has a won-
drous power of stretching itself out, or it would have
all disappeared long ago." But the point was gained,
and the five hundred pounds continued safely deposited
in its accustomed place; for all Mrs Borradaile's wants
were supplied with a liberal hand.
Devon to visit his relatives, and to him, and to his
cousinly attentions to Lucy, Mrs Borradaile had a
decided antipathy. He was of low origin,' the aspiring
lady said, 'besides being poor,'
But, my dear,' replied her spouse, Charles is my
nephew, and a good, honest, industrious fellow.'
But not a fit husband for your daughter, Mr Borra-
daile, I presume,' responded Nelly, tossing her head.
She might look higher, I should think,'
'Well, well, Nelly, perhaps so,' dubiously answered
Mr Borradaile, scratching his bald pate in an absent
manner; perhaps so-but Charlie is a fine, good lad,
nevertheless.'
Mr Borradailo strongly leaned towards his nephew:
nor was he blind to the mutual attachment of the
young folks; but there was time enough; and Lucy
was a decided belle; and she herself might change her
mind, and look higher too. He reasoned thus,
because his wife badgered him about Charles; for he
was an easy man, and desired peace and quietness
above all things. When Charles came to Otterton
Cottage, Mrs Borradaile assumed all the airs and
graces of a theatrical queen on the barn-floor-talked
at him, patronised him, or else was absolutely rude.

But Charles bore all with smiling good-humour,
which only tended to provoke the lady to wilder
flights.
I really wish, my dear Mr Borradaile,' said his wife
one evening when they were alone, Lucy having gone
to drink tea at the vicarage-'I really do wish, for
Lucy's sake, that you would exert yourself, as I am
so often asking you to do, and write to this niece of
yours, the Honourable Mrs Ivor, and ask her to come
and see you during the summer months. Then, in all
probability, she would ask us back again to Ivor
Lodge, or to B-Square; and consider the immense
advantages such an invitation would combine-such
an introduction into high society! Oh dear me! I
declare it puts me all in a flutter to think of it. Now,
do, my dear, write to the Honourable Mrs Ivor at once.
She is your niece, and a deal more worth paying atten-
tion to than that stupid, vulgar Charles Worthington.'
**Charles is neither vulgar nor stupid, Mrs Borra-
daile, I beg leave to say,' replied Mr Borradaile angrily;
"and I won't allow him to be called so by anybody.
And as to my niece, whom I have never seen-
Honourable Mrs Ivor-if report speaks true, she is an
-this
extravagant, flippant creature, not worthy to be named
in a breath with Charlie-the honest, fine lad. Besides,
you know as well as I do, that if I were fool enough to
write, she wouldn't take any notice; for depend upon
it she has been taught to be ashamed of having an
uncle in trade; for her father's family were as silly as
they were proud.'
But you are not in trade now, Mr B.,' replied his
wife; and I'm sure if the Honourable Mrs Ivor came
here and saw '- 'me' she was going to say, but
Otterton Cottage' was substituted- and saw Otter-
ton Cottage, she would be delighted with its elegance,
and not ashamed to claim relationship with the owners.'
My dear Nelly, you talk like a foolish woman,'
said Mr Borradaile peevishly, for he was tired of the
incessant boring about this 'honourable' niece. Rest
assured that Mrs Ivor is far too immersed in her own
concerns, in gaiety and fashion, to bestow a second
thought on her Devonshire relatives or their elegan-
ces. Why it was only the other day that you read an
account in the papers of a magnificent fête she gave at
Ivor Lodge; and how can you be such a goose as to
suppose she would care about this poor place?'
Ay, ay, it's all very well, Mr B.,' persevered the
lady; but didn't I read soon afterwards that report
said she was in debt and involved? for we didn't doubt
that I," and the stars after it, signified "Ivor," and she
a widow too."

Well, poor thing, I hope not,' replied Mr Borradaile;
"for she has a noble jointure, though indeed I fear she
is a careless one. But I have been told she has a kind
heart, although nurtured in a bad school. Don't let
us talk about her any more.'
But this command, often repeated after such con-
versations as the foregoing, was never attended to; and
Mrs Borradaile continued to talk of the Honourable Mrs
Ivor, and to worry her husband on all occasions, until
at length he began to give way, and promised that if
she would behave well to Charlie he would think about
penning a letter to his unknown niece.' He kept his
promise; thought about it for many weeks; fidgetted
himself almost into a fever, but accomplished the heavy

And the impertinence and affectation of the Honourable

she passed at Otterton; and ere she had been their
guest a week, hysterical affections much disturbed the
equanimity of Mr Borradaile, particularly as Julia
began to hint about, an anxious and harrowed mind."

And the best was done to cheer up the troublesome
fine lady ere she departed on her travels, which in three
weeks from the date of her arrival she deplored it was
her hard destiny to do. This announcement, however,
seemed to have been hastened by the arrival of Charles
Worthington, who found still less favour in the eyes of
Mrs Ivor than in those of Nelly herself. After his,
appearance the honourable dame became more and
more restless; till after being closeted for some time
with Mr Borradaile, she informed, the circle generally

'Yes, I fear so. To make a painful matter short, let
me tell you that your niece, Mrs Ivor, is quite incapable
of such proceedings as the false Mrs Ivor was so
successful in. The fine lady whom you entertained
here was no less a personage than Penelope Smith, the
handmaiden of the real honourable lady, who is a
charming personage despite her foibles; for she severely
blames herself for the careless habits which afforded
such opportunities for the clever but evil-disposed
Pen to carry out her knavish projectst Charles then
went on to say, that Mrs Ivor frequently desired
Penelope Smith to open her letters, and burn those
which were of no interest or consequence: in short,
Pen was her idle lady's right hand. But Pen was
found out in an intimacy with a notorious swindler,
and Mrs Ivor threatened to discharge her if she did not
immediately give up so disreputable a suitor. After
some demur, Pen promised to do so; but this was
merely a subterfuge; for to her mistress's surprise
she suddenly notified her intention of quitting Mrs
Ivor's service, just as the latter was on the eve of
setting off for the continent. Mrs Ivor was very angry
and annoyed, but she comforted herself with the re-
flection that in Paris she could easily proeure an
abigail less faithless and quite as expert as Miss Pen.
So Penelope Smith was instantly dismissed, and Mrs
Ivor had since heard that she had gone off to America
with the vagabond, at whose instigation, doubtless, she
had played off her impudent trick on the Borradailes,

Borradaile's epistle to his unknown niece, and also

She was, however, the sister of a good man and an

an early and thoughtless marriage is the only one you
have to blush for when your mother is named.' Here
Charles ceased, for Mrs Ivor was weeping and much
affected; but ere he quitted her a full explanation of
past circumstances ensued, when she expressed an
earnest desire to know her maternal uncle and Cousin
Lucy. Moreover,' said Charles, she entreats you all
to keep your appointment with the "Honourable Mrs

Borradaile was immensely facetious; but the why or

But many serious words are spoken in jest; for
with early spring came the real Mrs Ivor, to be present
at the celebration of Lucy's nuptials with Charles
Worthington, and looking almost as pretty as the fair
bride. Ere she quitted Otterton, Julia had succeeded
in reconciling Mrs Borradaile to one fashionable lady
at least, and in making Uncle Borradaile promise to
bring Nelly with him on a long summer visit to Ivor

them all-even Mr and Mrs Charles Worthington.

ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.
THE term atmospheric waves is one which of late
years has not unfrequently appeared in print in the
reports of the British Association and other scientific
publications, without, however, conveying to the minds
of the majority of readers other than a vague notion of
its import. The phenomena which it indicates are
nevertheless of a singularly interesting character,
giving us, in what is as yet known of them, an insight
to some of the movements of the great aërial ocean
which surrounds us.
One of the facts revealed to us by the barometer is,
that the pressure of the atmosphere is undergoing
continual modifications, now rising to a maximum,
then descending to a minimum, at longer or shorter
intervals. The maximum of pressure has been found
by experience not confined to any special locality, but
manifested over a wide region at one and the same
time, forming, as it were, a continuous line, sometimes
of great length. Extended observation has shewn that
the readings of a barometer at one station are inti-
mately related to similar readings at another, and all
subordinated to some great natural law, the operation
of which is not yet made out with certainty. Its
manifestation is seen in the elevation and depression of
the mercury: for example, at the most westerly of a
series of stations the barometer may indicate a maxi-
mum of pressure; it passes over and is absorbed at the
next in order; and so on seriatim until it has been traced
at the whole number.
According to Professor Dove, the north and south
aërial currents being converted into south-west in the
one hemisphere and north-west in the other, by the
rotation of the earth, these directions would pro-
bably be found to apply to the barometric movements.
But another set of currents has been detected as
acting directly at right angles to the former, and
the continued crossing and interference of the one
with the other may be regarded as a cause of the
apparent complexity of meteorological phenomena.
A distinction, too, is to be made in the character of
winds: some are winds of 'translation,' others of
'oscillation,' and will bear a comparison with oceanic
The first are monsoons
currents and tide streams.'
and trade-winds; the last, as Sir J. Herschel observes,
take their risc in local and temporary causes prevailing
over great areas simultaneously, the principal no doubt
depending on the prevalence of cloud or clear sky, rain
or dryness over great tracts for several days or weeks
in succession. But once produced, and an extensive
atmospheric undulation once propagated, a wind or
system of winds dependent on such undulation neces-
sarily arises also.'
Representing the maximum pressure at different
stations, as above observed, by a line, it is found to
have an advancing movement, caused, there is reason
to believe, by an undulation, and so similar to the
movements of the waters of the ocean, that the term
atmospheric wave has been applied as most expressive
of the peculiar action and effect. With maxima for
wave-crests, and minima for troughs or hollows, we may
thus ascertain the extent and duration of a wave;
taking care, however, not to confound, the movement
with that of the wind. The advancing form, it must
be remembered, is associated with a molecular move-
ment-the former indicated by the barometer, the latter
due to the wind.
The inquiries hitherto made into this interesting
branch of natural science, and first set on foot twenty
years ago, are mainly due to the British Association.
So actively were they at first taken up, that by the
year 1844 there were more than seventy stations of
observation, embracing Europe from north to south,
with an outlier or two in Asia. A large mass of
observations was speedily collected, involving so severe
an amount of labour in their reduction and discussion

published for several consecutive years in the reports
of the British Association, contain the sum of much
those by M. Quetelet, secretary of the Academy of
that has been done in this and other countries; while
Sciences at Brussels, comprise a series of highly valu-
able results and suggestions.
Starting with the observations of 1835, Mr Birt
shews that the hollow or trough of an atmospheric
wave was vertical over Brussels at three AM. on one of
the recorded days, and over London at eleven A. M. on the
same day, having been eight hours travelling westerly
from one to the other, at a rate of nearly thirteen miles
an hour. For want of other stations beyond the two

from Markree in Ireland, passing through London,
Brussels, and Geneva, to Gibraltar, shewed a marked
progressive relationship among them. It was observed,
however, that at times the Irish curve separated itself
from the general law, as though disturbed by some
cross wave; at others a sudden rise or dislocation'
appeared at Gibraltar, assignable, as was supposed, to
the immense radiation' of the African continent. In
December of the same year, so regular and systematic
was the rise of the mercury along this line of stations,
that, in Sir J. Herschel's words, to take in an effect
of this nature, we must enlarge our conception of an
atmospheric wave till it approaches in some degree, in
the extent of its sweep and the majestic regularity of
its progress, to those of the tide-waves of the ocean.'
A correspondence has also been noticed between
Oxford and London, Geneva and Turin, Cadiz and
Gibraltar. On one of the days in September a per-
fectly well-marked and definite atmospheric wave passed
over the British isles and the west of Europe, the crest
of the wave having a direction nearly N.N. E. and
S. S. W., and its progress being from W. N. W. to E. S. E.
The half-breadth of the wave, which occupied twenty-
six hours in its passage, covered a space extending from
Oxford in a direction perpendicular to that of the west,
to a point not far from Halle in Wirtemberg, which
gives, by rough measurement on a map, about 540
miles, and a velocity of about 21 miles per hour.'
The general results obtained from the discussion of

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
the observations at that time were the having traced
'distinct barometric waves of many hundreds of miles
in breadth over the whole extent of Europe that is to
say, at least over an area having Markree in Ireland,
Cadiz in Spain, Parma in Italy, and Kremsmünster in
Austria for its angular points. Not only the breadth,
but the direction of the front, and the velocity of pro-
gress of such waves, were clearly made out.'
In June of 1836 a wave presented itself which was
from nine to ten hours in passing from Markree to
Halifax in Nova Scotia a fact which led to further
observations on both sides the Atlantic. A comparison
of the Greenwich observations for 1840-41 with those
made at Toronto in the same period, shewed that a
general resemblance existed between the two: at each
place the mercury had risen above thirty inches in
every month. So clearly was the result established,
that by taking a maximum of the one it was possible
to predicate the maximum of the other at an interval
of a few days, the difference of time being the time
required for the passage of the wave. It further ap-
pears, on strict examination of the readings obtained at
Greenwich, that twice in each month the barometer
passes a maximum above, or but very slightly depressed
below thirty inches, but more usually above.'
"
The interval between the occurrence and recurrence
of the highest and lowest readings is occasionally pro-
tracted beyond what at first sight may appear to be the
regular period. Thus between the January and Feb-
ruary minima of 1841, 36 days transpired; and 31 days
16 hours between the September and October maxima
of the same year. Assuming that the maxima are
crests of waves, sixteen waves traversed England,
having a mean interval between their crests of 14 days
5 hours, in the seven months between February and
October. In all of these a certain symmetry is appa-
rent, and by a little scrutiny the type or normal wave
for different countries, or different localities in the same
country, may be found. Where irregularities occur,
they are chiefly due to geographical position: the more
the surface of a country is broken up by hills or moun-
tains the less of uniformity will there be in the atmo-
spheric currents. Besides which, any one system of
waves is exposed to interference from different systems,
or other physical causes. It is obvious that trustworthy
facts can only be eliminated by attention to these dis-
turbing causes. A few data, types for given localities,
and lines of greatest symmetry, have already been
established. In November 1842, one of the latter ex-
tended from Dublin to Birmingham, Brussels, and
Munich. In 1845 its course was along the southern
shores of England.
6
With regard to the direction of waves, this is deduced
from observation of the times when the maxima pass
stations widely distant from each other, the order
varying as the axis of translation' varies. Taking
Greenwich, Prague, and Munich-waves from W.N.W.
pass Greenwich first, and the other two places almost
simultaneously, a considerable time afterwards: these
éxhibit, therefore, simultaneous maxima. From S.S.W.

Munich, Prague, and Greenwich. The line of direction
for Central Europe is from the coasts of Belgium, the
Netherlands, and North Germany, to the frontiers of
Austria, where it converges at the extremity of the
Tyrolese Alps, from whence it is prolonged, and rises
to the north of the Black Sea beyond Moscow. This
distance, according to M. Quetelet, is travelled over in
two days, at the rate of from six to ten leagues an
hour-being more rapid in proportion as the surface of
the land is free from inequalities.

In this November wave Mr Birt considers that we have
the type of the barometric oscillations for that period of
the year. The rise and fall of the wave are so nearly
alike; they occur in the two weeks nearest the middle
of the month; the undulations which disturb the
symmetry of outline are always five in number; at the
setting in of the wave the barometer is low-under
twenty-nine inches. There are one or two exceptions
to the rule here specified, but not sufficient to invalidate
it. Eleven years' observations shew the crest to have
passed within five days of the middle of the month,
while from a series continued through fifteen years, it
occurs on the 28th. When dealing with undulations

As to the origin of atmospheric waves, it is admitted
that the heated air of the equatorial regions, after its
ascent and cooling, descends in the polar regions. The
dispersion of this cooled air may give rise to the aërial
waves; their propagation would accompany the currents
from the pole to the equator, and in our hemisphere
from north to south. Or the cooled air may diffuse
itself immediately around the pole, and if it form, as it
were, al complete canopy, the waves would be continuous
under every longitude, and passing any given station,
might be traced all round the globe. But contrariwise,
should the diffusion of the cooled air take place at some
distance from the pole, instead of forming a continuous
circle, and propagating itself by extension, it will be a
sector having its angle more or less open. The sectors,
by penetrating or inosculating each other, would produce
as a result a rapid series of undulations at the points of
contacts semol sodista et zhrout bogfister bakly
According to M. Quetelet, the latter is the most
probable explanation of the phenomena; the observa
tions indicate rather several distinct waves than one
continuous. As before observed, the questionis com-
plicated by the influence which a secondary systent of
waves exerts on the principal one; lessening, or at
times nullifying, the maximum. Yet there seems no
reason to doubt that certain indulations, continuous
but irregular, do circle round the pole. In Northern
Europe and Siberia a system extends from north to
south, the waves of which may be regarded as sectors
of different arcs not having precisely the same centres,
nor yet at the same instant the same radii. From the
juxtaposition of these partial waves there will result a
general, amdulation, making the entire circuit of the
pole in every latitude, advancing in certain places
towards the south, in others retreating towards the
north, whereby the stations in the circle would be
continually recording a succession of waves. lta

The late Mr O'Connell was convicted of sedition, and

legality of the proceedings in that court, was brought,
and the judgment was reversed by the House of Lords"
that is, by the votes of three law lords, Cottenham
Denmand and Campbell, against two, those of Lynd÷5

there were many peers in the House vehemently
opposed to O'Connell, and who thought the judgment
of the court below ought to have been maintained.
One Irish peer cried, Non-content," when the questions
was put by the lord chancellor, and rose to insist
upon his strict right to divide the House; but the cries!

a young female
Her Majesty appears in it to great advantage,
enacting her part in the gorgeous ceremonial with
inimitable dignity and grace-a grace and dignity which
lessons could not teach. Her reading of the speech is
singularly fine, purely intonated, and clear, effortless,
and musical as a silver-bell.'
The House is, I suppose, generally full upon such
occasions?'
It has always been so during this reign. The rise
of the House when the Queen enters, thronged as it is
with peers and peeresses, gorgeously arrayed in stars,
garters, feathers, diamonds, naval and military uniforms,
bishops in lawn sleeves, foreign diplomatists covered
with orders and crosses, is magnificent; and after Her
Majesty is seated, her ladies and pages have arranged
her splendid robe, and she commands her faithful Com-
mons to be summoned, there is another, and especially
if she be there to prorogue the parliament, a far more
impressive character of power impressed upon the
scene. Mr Speaker enters, followed by a mass of
unruly members, jostling each other for a good place,
and filling to overflow the space below the bar in
which we are now standing. As soon as silence is
obtained, the right honourable gentleman addresses
the Queen, enumerates the chief labours of the session,
and concludes by presenting the Supply and Appropria-
tion Bills, reserved for the occasion, and prays Her
Majesty's assent to them; which assent is accordingly
given in the old formula used only for this particular
bill:"La Reine remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur
bénévolence, et ainsi le veut"-("The Queen thanks her
good subjects, accepts their gift or benevolence, and so
wills it.") One feels that those ordinarily-attired men,
with their supply-bill, are the many-shafted column
which supports and gives height and true magnificence
to the richly-capitalled, the gorgeously-domed edifice,
which, with all its incongruities, stretches its ample
and majestic roof over one of the noblest societies of
freemen the world has ever witnessed.'
But surely the Peers are the Upper, the Commons
the Lower House?' remarked M. Vieuxtemps.
In name, yes. The shadow has remained, though
the substance has long since departed. The Lords'
House, albeit, has still deep roots in the tenacious
soil which it once overshadowed. Its historic names,
vast wealth, unquestionable patriotism, and moderating
influence upon the possibly too hasty speed of legisla-
tion, maintain, and will long maintain it as a virile and
independent estate of the realm; but in substantive
power the Houses have gradually, during the last five
hundred years, changed places. I will give you an
illustration of the silent revolution in this matter which
has occurred. Forms with us, provided they be only
forms, and in reality not injurious, are very, very
slowly discarded. Thus it happens that when the
Houses disagree with respect to changes in any measure
under discussion, and mutually appointmanagers' to
meet each other and explain on both sides the reasons
of disagreement, the Lords' managers, on meeting the
Commons' managers, sit down with their hats on, the
Commoners remaining upstanding and uncovered. The
Lords of course being gentlemen as well as peers, im-
mediately the custom is vindicated, uncover, and the
Commons seat themselves. Well, in a room belonging
to the Peers' House where this bizarre ceremony had
been exhibited, there were placed, or were about to be
placed, last year, by desire of the Peers, three pictures
by Landseer, of which the cost was a few thousand
guineas. The Commons, who approach their Lordships
uncovered, refused them this trifling gratification: the
money was struck out of the miscellaneous estimates,
and the Peers obliged to forego their pictures.'
It did not require such an instance to convince me
that your pretended monarchy is but a rampant demo-
|
cracy, its plebeian limbs concealed beneath ermined
robes, and its truculent brow veiled by a royal diadem,'
said M. Vieuxtemps.
"That, my dear sir, is a gross exaggeration, permit
me to say: the aristocratic element is very powerful in
this country, and the monarchical principle, as we
understand and honour it, remained not only erect, but
unshaken amidst the crash a year or two ago of falling
thrones and dynasties.'
The royal assent is not always given to bills in
the terms you have mentioned?' said Herr von
Blunderblast.
1
'No; there are three other forms. To an ordinary
public bill the form is, "La Reine le veut " ("The Queen
wills it.") To a private bill: "Soit fait comme il est
desire" ("Let it be done as desired.") To a bill embody-
ing a petition or declaration of a right, as in the time of
Charles the First, the form is "Soit droit fait comme il
est desiré" ("Let right be done as desired.").
'I wonder,' said M. Vieuxtemps, these vestiges of
Norman domination should be retained: they must
tend to keep alive humiliating recollections.'
'Humiliating fiddlesticks! Oliver Cromwell, to be
sure, abolished them, and gave his assent to laws in
plain English, but the old form came back with the
Restoration; and here, by the by, is the law lord back
again, and as neither of us has, I suppose, any over-
powering desire to listen to further eloquence in the
matter of this Chancery appeal, we had better adjourn
to Bellamy's for the hour or so which will elapse
before the Peers sit as legislators.'
།
'Bellamy's! What is Bellamy's?' asked Herr von
Blunderblast.
'A highly constitutional institution connected with
the House of Commons, and domiciled in the same
building: in other words, a very excellent hotel, in
which members take dinner, wine, punch, and refuge
from long speeches, quite certain that the division-bell
will summon them in time for the most important part
of their duties: Bellamy's is also, I am happy to say,
open to other persons, not being members, who have
"money in their pouch."?!
After we had dined, it was time to return to the
House of Lords. I had provided myself with peers'
orders, and we, consequently, the House being assem
bled, were soon in the Strangers' Gallery, very incon-
veniently situated behind that of the Reporters'.
"Ah! there is the lord chancellor we saw the other
day seated on the woolsack,' said M. Vieuxtemps; but
who is that big-wigged gentleman on the crimson
ottoman in front of him?"
That is Mr Baron Parke, come, I suppose, to read
a unanimous judgment of the judges of the Common-
Law Courts upon some point submitted to them by
their lordships. It is so: hark!'
'Do the Peers always govern themselves by this
opinion?' asked Herr von Blunderblast...
t
It is very rarely they do not. One exception was
O'Connell's case, before mentioned, a great majority of
the judges having pronounced the proceedings of the
Irish court to be perfectly legal. This Mr Baron
Parke, however, dissented from that opinion. When
the judges are not of one mind they attend and deliver
their opinions seriatim?
That is a bishop, I suppose,' remarked M. Vieux-
temps, on the upper bench to the right of the chan-
cellor; but how is it he does not wear his mitre ?'...
'His lordship, being the junior bishop, has attended
to say prayers. As to mitres, the bishops of the Eng-
lish established church only wear them on their coach-
panels and signet-seals. That venerable-looking peer
on the same side of the House, who is presenting a
petition, is the president of the Council--the most Noble

What is this interruption?' asked M. Vieuxtemps,
as Sir George Grey, accompanied by several members,
appeared at the bar with several bills passed by the
Commons.
'It is the Home Secretary,' I answered, 'presenting,
in the customary form, various bills passed by the

The Irish and Scottish peerages do not sit in this
House individually: they choose a certain number of
their order, as settled by the Acts of Union, to repre-
sent them. The Irish representative peers-twenty-cular
eight in number are chosen for life; the Scottish
sixteen in number for each parliament. The Crown
has power to add to the numbers of the Scotch and
Irish peers in this House, but English peers Her
Majesty may create ad libitum.
What, then, becomes of the independence of the
House of Peers if the Queen can at any moment swamp
them by new creations?' asked M. Vieuxtemps.
The unlimited right of the Crown to create peers is
one of the weapons, in the armoury of the constitution,
which can never be wielded except in extreme cases, in
which the ministers of the sovereign are supported
by an overwhelming majority of the Commons. The
only instante I remember of the creation of peers,
specially for the purpose of swamping a hostile ma-
jority, was by Sir Robert Walpole, who induced the
monarch to create twelve in one day for that purpose:
a witty peer of that day asked them whether they
intended to vote individually or by their foreman:
nevertheless it is essential the power should be lodged
in the Crown. The mere menace of exercising it
dissipated, a few years ago, a very great danger to the
state.' 1

This sum was L.200, a dollar being generally calcu-
lated here at four shillings. Then we had some girls
and young women sold in the same way.
Come up, Lucy! Now, gentlemen, here we have a
fine specimen of everything desirable in a good servant
-young, healthy, active, and industrious; can cook,
wash, iron, wait at table. In fact, she is highly
recommended to our attention, and is guaranteed free
from all blemish, disease, or vice, as prescribed by law.'
Poor Lucy was knocked down at 600 dollars-L.120.
These were both high prices. The men under thirty
years generally sell for about L.140 to L.160, and the
women under thirty, from L.80 to L.90. When above
forty they are not worth more than half that price.
Such persons as the above do not care much about
being sold. They are generally purchased, or at least
many of them, by persons who hire them out as servants
to families; and many of them have good places, and
may get hired out to go to the same street, or near to
where they were before. But a very different feeling
is manifested at a sale of slaves belonging to a plan-
tation. Their old master, always kind to them, may
have died, or failed; and to see fifty or sixty of the
slaves brought to auction is a horrible scene. All of
them, old and young, may have been born on the same
estate, and become endeared to one another. They
think of the happy plantations, the snug little wooden
whitewashed cottages surrounding their master's dwel-
ling and garden, the summer-evening meetings, when
they played the banjo, sung their native songs, and
danced their cheering reels with light feet and lighter
hearts; for a negro with a good master is extremely
happy being clothed, fed, comfortably housed, and
well cared for. But now they are all about to be sold,
and torn from each other. They are standing in rows
in the auction-mart, ready for any rude hand to ex-
amine them, feel their muscle, criticise their shape,
their height, their strength, or healthy appearance, and,
opening their mouths with finger and thumb, inspect
their teeth. A middle-aged man and woman may be
seen standing together: moist are their eyes, anxiously
they gaze around them-they are the picture of help-
lessness. They know the awful doom of separation

and the handsome family that cluster around them;

sons and daughters, old enough to know what awaits
them, press close together, with full eyes and still
fuller hearts; while the young favourites are rejoicing,
in perfect innocence, in the clothes which they are
decked out in for the day, to enhance their appear-
ance and their value; and they gaze with pleasurable
amusement at the novelties of the scene, like a child
at the pageantry of a funeral-the trappings of the
horses, and the plumes on the hearse that bears to the
grave the remains of a parent. They are at length called
up; and although husband and wife go together, the
children are all taken from them, and sold into different
districts; and as the mother tries to look at their re-
treating figures through eyes blinded with tears, she
knows that in a few years they are probably fated in
their turn to endure the same agony-
And thou, my son, yet have a son foredoom'd a slave

FAREWELL!
DARK spots there are in sunny places,
Thorns on the stems of flow 'rets fair,
Clouds overshadowing beauteous faces,
Young bosoms harbouring fear and care;
Mingling with tones of mirth and gladness,
We hear the dull funereal kuell,
'Mid pleasure's glee the voice of sadness
Sighs mournfully, Farewell! farewell!
Farewell to summer's gentle breezes,
To friendship's whispers, gentler still;
Our frames the breath of winter freezes,
Our souls are 'numbed by scorn and ill.
Farewell, once gay and fragrant flowers ལྕ;
No dewdrop gilds the drooping bell;
So dried by grief, these hearts of ours
Can scarcely moan, Farewell, farewell!'
Welcome to him the smiling morrow
Who tosses through the weary night;
Welcome to every child of sorrow
The joyful sound- Behold the light!'
Then how can hearts by anguish riven,
Too sharp, too deep for song to tell,
Forbear to pant, to pine for Heaven,
Where none shall cry, Farewell, farewell?'

SLOW AND RAPID COMPOSITION,
Speed in composition is a questionable advantage.
Poetic history records two names which may represent
the rapid and the thoughtful pen-Lope de Vega and
Milton. We see one pouring out verses more rapidly
than a secretary could write them; the other building
up, in the watches of the dark, a few majestic lines. One
leaving his treasures to be easily compressed into a single
volume; the other to be spread abundantly over forty-
six quartos. One gaining fifteen pounds; the other a
hundred thousand ducats. One sitting at the door of
his house, when the sun shone, in a coarse coat of gray
cloth, and visited only by a few learned men from
foreign countries; the other followed by crowds whenever
with delight. It is only since the earth has fallen on

THE LADIES' GUILD.
WHEN Society began to emerge out of the darkness of
the Iron Age, the gentler sex enjoyed its fair share of
the elevation. Women, indeed, received from chivalry
even an undue predominance, and the strength and
valour of men crouched, as if with the fabulous instinct
of the lion, at the feet of beauty, The women of that
time, however, are not correctly appreciated in ours.
It is the custom to regard them as mere painted
puppets, set up by the fantastic spirit of the age as a
mark for skill or bravery, and with no more authentic
claims to our respect than the silken banner of the
joust, where they rained influence and adjudged the
prize.' It is not generally known, or is always for-
gotten, that that very banner was worked by female
fingers, and that many of the luxurious trappings of
chivalry, which contributed more to the advancement
of society than the gallant but foolish blood that
bespattered them, owed their existence to female indus-
try and ingenuity. Even so early as the eleventh
century, the women of England were so famous for
embroidery that in that age it was called English
work,' just as in ancient times it was 'Phrygian work;'
and among others we read of Matildis, an English-
woman, distinguished for her skill in dyeing purple,
and adorning robes with gold, gems, paintings, and
flowers.
In the following century this reputation continued,
and the names of the fair workwomen which have come
down to us belong always to the aristocratical class.
Christina, Princess of Margate, who lived in the year
1189, was a capital hand at such matters; and a mitre
and pair of sandals which she embroidered were declared
to be perfect wonders.' They were presented by the
abbot of St Albans to the pope of that day; and thus
the loftiest head and holiest toe in Europe were clothed
by English female industry.
6
In the fourteenth century, however, we arrive at
a more interesting epoch, when women stand promi-
nently out among the ingatherers of that true harvest
of the Crusades, which consisted in the establish-
ment of industry upon the ruins of feudalism. The
knights had been beggared by their extravagance;
property had changed hands; and skilled artificers of
all kinds felt themselves to be men-that is, when they
were not women. But a great proportion of them
were women; and as such they inherited, in a modified
manner, the immunities bestowed by chivalry upon
their grandmothers, and were allowed privileges for-
bidden to the men. Male artificers were tied down to
one profession; but the same law secured the liberty of
women-a liberty which they seem to derive from the
If
charter of nature itself to do as they thought fit.
A man was fixed for life to his loom, or his anvil, or
his last; but a woman might try the whole circle of
the trades till she found one to her taste, and then go
round again out of sheer feminine love of variety. In
the records of those gallant days we find female
brewers, bakers, weavers, spinners, embroiderers, and
others employed in various works in wool, linen, and
silk. They were distinguished by the female termina-
tion ster: thus a brewster, backster, webster, means a
woman who brews, bakes, weaves.
In the middle of the fifteenth century the female
manufacturers in weaving, carding, spinning, and other
branches of industry, are particularised in a public
document. This is a resolution of parliament, in which
the prohibition of English cloths in the Netherlands is
complained of as being hurtful to our industrious coun-
trywomen. But sometimes parliament-so unlike the
parliament of our own enlightened time!--required to
be reminded of its duty; and in the year 1457 we find
the silkwomen of London memorialising the legislature,
in good-set terms, on the injury they sustained from
the free importation of foreign goods of the kind by
which they themselves got their living. We may fancy
the meeting at which this memorial was got up-the
resolutions, the speeches, the indignant appeals, the
shrill screams of laughter, defiance, or applause! But
the agitation was successful; and the parliament which
had complained so pathetically of a similar step taken
by the Low Countries, indulged the ladies with a pro-
hibition in their turn. The same favour was shewn to
them in the year 1463; but the time was now at hand
when women should stand no more upon their indus-
trial rights, real or supposed, but come before the
country, when they came at all, in the character of
victims, mendicants, and castaways.
It would be impossible to describe the process by
which they were elbowed out of their employments by
the other sex, because this was so gradual as to be

curious circumstance attended it; namely, that when
men installed themselves in the places of women,
they retained the feminine appellations, and became
brewsters, backsters, websters, and so on. One only
of the names remained peculiar to the fair sex --
spinsters; and the law to this day appears to suppose
the word to designate an employment followed by all
unmarried women.
The chivalry which in one age made women objects
of worship, and in another age removed the interdic-
tions from their industry which shackled that of the
men, has changed its form in ours, but not its charac-
ter. We take them now entirely upon our own hands.

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
We consider work-except among the lower classes-a
kind of degradation; and no matter how many of them
may fall to our lot as individuals, we feel bound in
honour to bring them up in idleness. This is very
generous no doubt, but it is the ignorant, unreflecting
generosity of a preux chevalier. It fancies that there
is no change, no death in the world; it stakes the very
subsistence of the objects of our solicitude upon a
single hazard; it throws them for life upon sympathy,
forbearance, kindness; and it accustoms them so much
both to the idea and the reality of dependence, that in
frequent cases many years of the higher spirits of the
sex pass away in a hopeless but bitter and indignant
struggle with what they conceive to be their social
destiny. As for spirits of the commoner kind, their
time and thoughts are occupied with the change from
one dependence to another, which is the only consum-
mation offered to their hopes. Marriage with them is
the grand alternative; but marriage too seldom accom-
panied by that which truly consecrates it-the sponta-
neous love of the proud and free.
to use a homely phrase, puts the cart before the horse:
it produces supply before demand has arisen. It is not
too late, however, to remedy this inadvertence. Let
the number of ladies be strictly limited at first, and a
fair trial given to the manufacture; and when the
demand increases, so far from there being any difficulty
in meeting it, the supply will seem to come of nature
and necessity.
Although the Ladies' Guild, however, cannot be con-
sidered to meet the exigencies of the time, it goes a
certain way towards it: it is that most important of all
stages-the first step. It countenances female industry,
and it offers a field for it which may prove-and we
hope will prove-of considerable magnitude. The sub-
stance Miss Wallace works in is luckily of a kind to
disarm many feminine prejudices; for the gentility of
the work is unquestionable. Even in the fourteenth
century, when the first manufactory was established in
France by permission of Philip de Valois, it was con-
sidered that persons of the best families might follow
the employment without losing caste. This idea was
confirmed by the government itself," for in public deeds
such manufacturers were styled gentlemen of the art
and science of glass-making;' and the privilege of form-
ing one of these establishments was bestowed upon a
person near Lyons as a reward for military services
rendered at the battle of Agincourt. We must not,
however, be betrayed by these circumstances into
forming any extravagant notion of the article then
produced. It was nothing more than window-glass
that was achieved by these gentlemen,' and that only
in round plates, with a boudine or eye in the middle,
affording at the utmost a square of eight inches. The
colour of this glass was yellowish, variegated here and
there with bubbles; and it is supposed that the desire
to hide such deformities originated the custom of
painting the small squares framed in lead, which
formed the church windows.
The exemption of women from the law of work is in
certain classes in England one of the greatest of our
social evils; and it is the more puzzling that it seems
to have grown out of the advancing civilisation of the
time. In our own immediate day, however, a kind of
reaction seems to be at its commencement. We hear
of some female authors by profession, some female
artists, engravers, decorators of various kinds; there
are likewise actresses and singers, who by their pri-
vate characters give respectability as well as beauty
to their branch of art; and there are constantly adver-
tisements appearing-many of them fraudulent no
doubt, but still indications of the turn the public mind
is taking offering professions to gentlewomen by which
they may be able to support themselves in indepen-
dence. All this, however, bespeaks as yet only the
necessity of the case, and the craving for relief it elicits;
for in reality no perceptible change has taken place in
society. What is wanted is a more open agitation of
the question of female employment, and an example
offered in the respectable middle classes, of a nature fit
to dispel for ever the prejudices which render the posi-porary, 'The Builder:
tion of woman in society so sad and so anomalous.
For this reason we have been as much interested by
the prospectus of an association called the Ladies'
Guild as we were a short time since by that of the
Literary Guild. The prospectus complains that hitherto
almost the only resource of educated women has been
tuition, and proposes a novel and interesting plan,'
by which combination may accomplish what individual
effort could never achieve.' This plan is for ladies to
assemble in a school of instruction in London, where,
for the nominal sum of two shillings per week (to meet
necessary expenses) they may become mistresses of a
certain decorative art, protected by patent, and their
productions in which will be sold for their own benefit.
Ladies in the provinces are likewise invited to this
common centre, where they may form an associated
home in connection with the Guild, and thus live at a
far less cost than any individual can do in a separate
position. There is something extremely seductive in
this idea; and if Miss Wallace, the amiable and gifted
patentee, who consecrates the fruits of her genius to the
disenthralment of her countrywomen, were but as correct
in her political economy as she is in her philanthropy,
it might even be regarded as the solution of a great
problem. But unluckily the production referred to,
however beautiful and elegant, is a thing of mere taste
and fashion; and even were it otherwise, there is no such
thing as forcing an article into general consumption.
In its unlimited invitation to lady-workers, the Guild,
*

applications are to be made, addressed to Mrs Hill, Vice-President
of the Ladies' Guild.

The Ladies' Guild, however, have now very different
materials to work upon; and we may form some idea
of the results produced under Miss Wallace's patent
from the following description taken from our contem-
All our ideas of Oriental splendour-all the gorge-
ous imaginings of Orientals themselves, might now be
realised to sight at least in the sober actualities of
British decorative art in glass. The lustre of silver
and gold, the fiery sparkle of the ruby, amethyst, and
every actual or imaginable gem, and the more sub-
dued, but no less beautiful hues of the pearl and the
tropical shell, may now, by the recent efforts of British
skill and invention, be combined at a moderate cost,
and without a vestige of mere gaudy glitter, in the
decorations of the mansions of the gentlemen of Eng
land. Miss Wallace's productions consist, in principle,
of imitations of gold and silver in glass, without the
use of either metal; of the protection of actual gilding
or silvering under an almost invisible yet magnifying
coat of glass; of a peculiar mode of adding metallic and
pearly brilliancy to colours, to painted and stained
figures, and to engravings, all in glass; of imitations of
marbles, alabaster, malachite, &c., in glass-covered
compositions; of imitations of precious stones; and
of other inventions.
Among the various forms under which these are
brought into use, in architectural decoration, are those
of ceilings, in which a combination of them with a
peculiar mode of enamelling in white or pale blue on
the inner surface of the interspaces in glass (another
of this lady's numerous inventions also applied with
good effect to framed engravings) is capable of pro-
ducing a dazzling effect, particularly by night, with a
good or even an indifferent light reflected from it.
Mouldings and cornices are made to harmonise with
these effects; and the same combinations, varied with the
pearly brilliance of painted flower-wreaths, and wreaths

of silver engraved on a gold surface, all in glass, are
made to adorn the walls in form of picture-frames.
Besides a number of these productions in varied detail,
we saw a specimen of stained-glass decoration for
windows in form of armorial bearings, in vivid colours,
made peculiarly sparkling and brilliant, and in some
phases pearly, by one of the processes already alluded
One great feature in most of the inventions is,
that they are all protected, mostly within hollow mould-
ings of glass hermetically sealed, so that the gilding,
&c. can never tarnish, and the whole is in this respect
everlasting. So is it with the marble imitations, which
are so firmly embedded in composition that they are
said to be quite well adapted to all the risk of exterior
construction for which they are designed, as well as for
chimney-pieces and other forms of interior decoration.'
This new and brilliant art, it will be seen, displaces
no other. Its productions are additions to the list of
elegances demanded by a refined and luxurious age,
and their application is so various-so almost univer-
sal-that the institutors of the Ladies' Guild are not
unjustifiable in imagining that they have opened out
to women of the middle classes a wide and elegant
profession. Let them take care, however, say we, of
their first step. No trade can be forced; and it will
be much safer and kinder to invite ladies into the
field as they are wanted, than to collect a multitude
in the metropolis to work on the speculation of a
market.*
'You may not think Gerald a sufficiently good match
for me now, papa,' she would say; but I know the day
will come that you will be proud to call Gerald your
son-in-law!'
"That may be: I do not dispute Mr Spencer's talents;
but in the meantime he has no money; and however
clever a young man may be, it is often years before he
gets into practice.'
'Very well, papa; we are in no hurry. I don't think
it will be so long as you expect before Gerald makes
his way. Such talents as his cannot long remain
unknown; but as I said just now, we are in no hurry;
and he would be quite as averse to our marriage taking
place prematurely as you would be. He said only the
last time he was here, that till he had a comfortable
home to offer me, he would never mention the subject
to you.'
Very well, Lucy, so much the better; only don't let
him mention it to you either; and take care you have
not to wait for him till all the bloom is off your
cheeks.'
'I'm not afraid, papa,' answered Lucy; but even if it
were so, Gerald would love me just the same, and we
could be very happy without the bloom.'
Secure of his love and sanguine of success, Gerald
thought he could wait too: bright anticipations of the
future lent a charm to labour that was to be so sweetly
rewarded; and after studying at Paris and Vienna, and
rendering himself in all respects worthy of the public
patronage he counted on, with the assistance of his
father he took a small house in the neighbourhood of
Golden Square, and with a brass-plate on the door
announcing his name and profession, he sat down to
wait for patients; and patients came, not a few, betwixt
nine and eleven o'clock, when it was understood he was
at home; but alas, how seldom did one of them bring a
guinea in his hand! They were all paupers or next to it-
people whom he had attended in the hospitals, or such as
were sent by these; for, enthusiastic in his art, he had
willingly and carefully investigated and ministered to
the maladies of the poor, and when they learned where
he was to be found, they crowded to his door. And he
was content to see them-they offered subjects for study
and improvement; but there would be no getting on
without a few rich ones too: how else was he to pay his
rent, and have a home for Lucy? However, there was
nothing to do but to wait and hope, and he did both--
alter-wearying though such waiting is to a man eager to rise,
and who knows he has the capacity to do so, if he could
once get his foot on the ladder.
A TALE OF DAYS NOT LONG GONE BY.
THERE resided some years ago in London a young
surgeon named Gerald Spencer. He was the younger
son of a gentleman of good family but small fortune;
and as everything that remained to the father was
entailed on the eldest son, a good professional education
was all that Gerald could expect from his father, and
it was all he got. But in the matter of education
nothing was spared; and as Gerald had both the will
and the ability to profit by the instructions he received,
there was great reason to hope for a successful pro-
fessional career.
It is often a good thing for a young
man to have nobody to rely on but himself. Those
who have something to fall back upon hope to do and
may do;
but he must do or die; and this stern
native quickens a man's wits, and lends amazing vigour
to his energies. Gerald felt the full force of the
necessity; and all the more, that he was deeply in love
with the daughter of one of his father's neighbours. He
had known Lucy Manwaring from her childhood, for
she was six years his junior, and he had loved her ever
since he was old enough to know what love was. But
though she was the daughter of a gentleman, like
himself she had nothing but her personal qualifications
to recommend her. These, however, were considerable,
for she was both amiable, pretty, and intelligent, and,
above all, devotedly attached to her lover, respecting
whose talents she was quite enthusiastic.
* Some years ago, a paragraph suggesting wood-engraving as an
employment for females was transferred into this Journal from
the Westminster Review.' Carried thus into the hands of the great
multitude of the middle classes, who form our weekly audience,
it seemed immediately to excite the hopes of a vast number of
women who felt the disadvantage of the forced idleness to which
they are restrained by society. The host of letters we received on
the subject, chiefly inquiring by what means the fair writers could
be introduced to such an employment, gave us an impression
which will not soon be effaced, of the extent of the social evil in
question. We wish to speak moderately when we say, that no
article ever appeared in this Journal which excited one-fourth so
much sensation as appeared to arise from this small quoted para:
graph. Literally, years passed before the correspondence produced
by it was at an end. We fear that it led in only a few instances
to any useful result.-Ed.
The disappointments and anxieties that have attended
the early career of many a man who has afterwards
risen to eminence, have been so frequently described
that they need not be dwelt upon here: it is enough to
say that poor Gerald Spencer endured them all; and as
he had spoken with confidence of his certain success
both to his own friends and his mistress, it was doubly
mortifying to find his performance falling so far short
of his promise, that the first year he was obliged to
apply to his father for money to pay his rent-a favour
that was not granted without some vexatious allusions
to the large sums that had been spent on an education
which it was high time should produce its harvest. But
still the rich drove past his door, flying for relief to men
whose established reputations inspired hope and confi-
dence, whilst he was exercising all his skill on patients
who had nothing but blessings to give him in return.
But although blessings are indeed blessed things, they
will not furnish a man's table nor pay his rent, still
less can he marry upon them; and the young surgeon's
heart grew sick with disappointment as his hopes faded
from day to day.
'Yes,' he would say to himself with bitterness, 'when
the present generation have died off; when Astley
Cooper, and Cline, and all the rest of them, are gone;
when I am fifty years old, and Lucy Manwaring is

married to somebody else for how can I expect her
to wait for me all her life?-and is perhaps the mother
of a dozen children, I shall get into practice and drive
my carriage. I had better have been born a day-
labourer than be the son of a gentleman with an
empty purse, and talents I can find no opportunity of
exercising.'
His position was so difficult too, for his pride forbade
him to tell the whole truth; and whilst he was holding
out fallacious hopes to his mistress, he found them as
far as ever from realisation.
•
Amongst the young students of medicine he had
become acquainted with about the hospitals was one
called O'Grady. He was an Irishman, as his name
indicated; apparently of low birth, without connections,
and with little talent or industry. Neither did he
evince any ambition or desire to rise. He seemed
either conscious that he was born for mediocrity or
content with a little; but that little he never appeared
to want. Yet those who had known him longest had
understood from himself that he had no private resources,
but had come to London to trade on his talents and
education, like many amongst them. It occurred to
Gerald sometimes to wonder how he contrived to live;
whether he might not have fallen into some inferior
line of practice that paid in some degree-a practice
that, in perspective, he would himself have scorned,
but now he would be too glad to take anything he
could get. With the view of finding out O'Grady's
secret he cultivated his society, which, from not liking
him, he had originally rather avoided. When the
Irishman saw him disposed to be civil, he shewed
himself ready enough to meet him half way; and one
day, as they quitted one of the hospitals together, he
invited him to dine with him at an eating-house he
frequented in the neighbourhood.
The dinner was not in the grand style, but it was
plentiful; and O'Grady called for a bottle of wine to
relish it—a luxury the other was little accustomed to.
Upon my word, O'Grady,' said he, you make it
out capitally if this is the style you live in every day.
I don't know how it is, but though I get plenty of
patients I never get a fee.'
'Nor I either,' said O'Grady. Why, man, if I
depended on fees, I should not get butter to my bread.'
'Oh! I beg your pardon,' said Gerald; you have
doubtless some private resources. Fortunate man, say
I! I wish I had.'
O'Grady did not deny the imputation, and so the
matter rested for that time; but as either for motives
of his own, or from good-nature, he not unfrequently
invited Gerald to share his dinner, the intimacy con-
tinued till a degree of confidence was established
between them that led to momentous results.
'As for my getting into practice here, I look upon it
as out of the question, without some extraordinary
lucky hit,' said O'Grady one day. I mean by and by
to go back to old Ireland, where, in some miserable
hole or another, I shall settle down as a country doctor,
and spend the rest of my life astride of the sharp
backbone of an Irish horse. But you ought to get into
practice: you have not only abilities but industry;
and there isn't a man amongst us who has a better
right to get on than you have.'
And yet this ability and industry you are pleased
to attribute to me will scarcely find me in bread and
cheese. And the hard part of it is, that when fortune
turns her back upon a man in this manner in the
beginning of life, one can't-at least I can't-afford to
wait till she is in better humour. I suppose practice
may come by and by, when I am forty or fifty years
of age; but how am I to live and keep up appearances
in the meantime?'
If I had your gift of the gab,' said O'Grady, ‘and
knew as much about the thing as you do, I'd give
lectures on anatomy. In that way you'd get known.'
'But who'd come to them? That is, who'd pay to
come to them?--and without fees I couldn't do it.'. I
'I'll tell you what would bring you fees.'
"What?'
'Not talking alone, I admit; but get subjects-shew
'em what you teach, and you'll get plenty of students
to come to you, I warrant.
K
I daresay. But how am I to get subjects? Why,
gave forty pounds for one lately.
'I know that,' answered O'Grady; but there are
ways of doing it;' and then, with his elbows on the
table, he leaned across, and in a low voice communicated
to Gerald the secret he alluded to.
At that time, and it is not so very many years since
these circumstances occurred, surgeons were expected,
as much as now, to be acquainted with all the mysteries
of the human frame, whilst the legislature placed every
impediment in the way of their diving into its secrets.
There was no provision made for supplying them with
subjects, whilst to obtain them by violating the grave-
yards was an unlawful act. Of course, however, they
were so obtained; many a man lived by the trade, and
the surgeons were under the necessity of countenancing
the crime, or of remaining in ignorance of what they
were bound to know. Some of the dire consequences
of this short-sighted legislation became known to the
world, and we have a verb adopted into our vocabulary
which will carry down the legend to posterity; but it
is well understood that there were many more deaths
by burking in different parts of the kingdom, especially
in London, than ever became public, as also that the
annals of the resurrectionists would record many
strange escapes and frightful adventures.
But to return to our story. Shortly after the con-
versation alluded to betwixt Spencer and O'Grady, the
former made known his intention of giving lectures on
anatomy; indeed, he put advertisements into the papers
to that effect, whilst it was secretly circulated amongst
the students that a subject would be provided for each
lecture. As the opportunities for practical observation
were so limited as to render such occasions extremely
desirable, and as the abilities of the lecturer were well
known amongst students of medicine, he had even from
the first a pretty good attendance; and their favourable
report spreading, soon brought more, especially as the
fee was moderate, till at length he could boast of a
crowded audience. Of course every man present was
aware that the subjects which formed the chief attrac-
tion were illegally procured; but it was everybody's
interest to keep the secret, and nobody sympathises
with laws that run counter to human necessities. So
the lectures continued and flourished; and the fame
they slied brought patients, till the young surgeon's
fortunes improved so far, and promised so well for the
future, that he ventured to make his proposals to Mr
Manwaring; and the lovers being quite weary of living
on protracted hope, they pleaded their own cause so
energetically that the father's consent was won, and
they were married.
On this event taking place, trusting that his prac-
tice would increase, and be sufficient to maintain him-
self and his wife, Mr Spencer resolved to abandon for
ever those midnight expeditions with O'Grady, to which
his pecuniary necessities had won him to consent, but
which he had never undertaken without feelings of
horror and disgust, as well as extreme apprehension of
the disgrace of a discovery, which would have probably
so far shocked the public as to do him irreparable
mischief in his professional career.
For some little time, therefore, he depended on his
legitimate profits to furnish funds for his family ex-
penses; but these were not always sufficient, and an
empty purse sometimes drove him to his old resources
resources, however, of which his wife remained wholly
ignorant. That he gave lectures occasionally she
knew, and that he was every now and then out greas

part of the night with his friend O'Grady; but how
they were employed, though she sometimes wondered,
she was never told.
In the meantime Lucy, who having yet no child, had
a great deal of time to herself, and who had been
accustomed in the country to visit and minister to the
poor of the neighbourhood, had joined a society of
benevolent ladies, which had originated in a proposal of
Mrs Fry and a sister of hers, Mrs Schimmelpenninck
a beautiful woman, who married a German, or rather,
I believe, a Dutchman-for the purpose of visiting,
improving, and relieving the poor of the metropolis.
Each lady had her district appointed, and some of these
spread over extremely bad neighbourhoods; but the
founders of this society maintained that, in the very
worst, there existed no danger for the visitor; and they
themselves fearlessly set the example of going into
quarters that less enthusiastic women would have cer-
tainly eschewed.
Lucy, however, was an enthusiast both in benevo-
lence and religion; and she would have despised her-
self for refusing to follow where those she looked up to
Ted. She therefore cheerfully accepted the district
appointed to her, which was none of the best; and as
experience seemed to confirm the opinion of the pre-
siding ladies, she went amongst all sorts of people
without fear witnessing an immense deal of wretched-
ness, the consequence of an immense deal of vice, from
which generally, though the least corrupted, the women
were the deepest sufferers, and it was by them she was
most gratefully received. Often when the men were
sullen the wives expressed by their tears feelings they
durst not otherwise give vent to above all, when they
saw their sick children relieved and comforted.
Amongst
her children, both of whom were young; but she looked
unusually sallow, and, as Lucy thought, the cloud on
her brow lowered darker than ever.
'I've brought you a little wine to strengthen you,'
she said; and as I have half an hour to spare I have
something here I should like to read to you.'
'I'm obliged to you for the wine,' she answered;
but I don't want the reading: it don't do me no good,
but just makes me worse like.'
'No,' said Lucy; I'm sure what I read can't make
you worse; but perhaps it makes you think yourself
worse, and that's a good sign. We are in the way to
mend when we see how bad we are.'
"I can't mend, and it's no use,' answered the woman;
it's very well for them as is differently situated; but
where one's lot's cast one must bide.'
4
'Nobody's lot is cast in wickedness,' answered Lucy.
That's more than you can tell,' said the woman
sullenly. You gentlefolks come among us, and bring
us wine and doctor's stuff, and no doubt we ought to
be thankful, for you 're noways obligated to do it; but
for your readings and your preachings they can't do us
no good, 'cause our necessities is stronger than words
printed upon paper, and when maybe we might wish
to be better than we are, we can't; perhaps there's them
as won't let us sometimes want won't let us.'
All that you say is very sad,' answered Lucy; but
depend on it wickedness and impiety can never improve
anybody's circumstances in the long-run, though it
may seem so for a little while.'
1
We poor folks ha'n't no time to look for'ards,'
returned Mrs Vennell. We must find bread for our-
selves and our children from one day to another, and if
we can't get it by fair work we must get it which way
the ground others there was a house in her district, we can.'
of which was occupied by some people
of the of Vennell. The family consisted of a man
and his wife, and two children; and although they lived
in a great deal of dirt and muddle, and apparent
wretchedness, they did not seem to be in any want, which
was a circumstance the less to be expected that Vennell,
from all she could learn, was an idle fellow, who fol-
lowed no regular occupation, and his wife was a sickly
woman, not fit for any.
On the whole it was a very unpromising sort of
ménage, and on Lucy's first visit the woman received
her so uncivilly, saying, amongst other things, that
they wanted nothing of her, that she had not repeated
it. Being informed, however, some time afterwards,
that Mrs Vennell was very ill, she called, and found her
in bed with a rheumatic fever; whereupon she not only
sent the district physician to attend her, but boing
anxious to make an impression on the woman, who,
from having rejected her ministrations, she concluded
to be more than commonly in wans of them, she
returned frequently, carrying her such little comforts
and indulgences as the funds of the society could afford,
and often reading to her for an hour at a time by her
bedside. The effect of all this kindness, however, was
not very visible. The woman seemed to a certain
degree grateful, but she was not softened. She con-
tinued close and reserved, and there was a dark
ominous cloud ever on her brow that produced an
involuntary impression against her. Nevertheless,
Lucy, whose enthusiasm was only exalted by difficul-
ties, felt th
that the worse Mrs Vennell's spiritual con-
dition was the more she was bound to persevere in her
efforts to ameliorate it; so she continued her visits,
though by this time the woman was able to rise from
her bed, and was fast recovering her usual state of
health.
"
One afternoon, late in the month of October, in the
year 1816, Lucy had been visiting her district, and
finding she had a little wine to spare, which she thought
would be an excuse for a call on Mrs Vennell, she went
round that way. The woman was up, nursing one of
7
'But dishonest ways are like false friends, my good
Mrs Vennell -
'Don't call me good; what I am, I am: I'm no
hypocrite.'
+
And I like you the better for that, and I've the
more hope of you.'
Mrs Vennell shook her head, and could not be
brought to admit that there was any hope of her; but
on the whole, in spite of this disavowal of amendment,
Lucy's opinion of her was improved by these late oppor-
tunities of observation, and she inclined to think, from
several obscure hints she had dropped, that her husband
lived by some dishonest practices, in which the wife
took her part more or less, though not without certain
regrets and longings after a better state. What Ven-
nell's occupation was she did not know: his wife said,
in answer to her inquiries, that he jobbed about; but
she had never yet happened to see him.
*After some further conversation she took her leave,
impressed with the idea that the woman was more than
usually uneasy and desponding, and that it was not like
the despondency arising from want or the apprehension
of it, but more like the darkness of a spirit clouded by
a troubled conscience. The door of the house opened
into a dismal sort of lane, skirted on the opposite side
by a dead-wall of no great height, which divided it from
a churchyard: one of those churchyards in the heart of
the metropolis about which so much has lately been
written. As Lucy walked up the lane a man passed
her, in company with a deformed lad, who was appa-
rently extremely tipsy. The man was dressed like a
labourer, and she looked back after him, wondering if
it was Vennell. As she turned her head he turned too,
and their eyes met for a moment; but the boy reeled
about so distressingly that she hastened on to escape
the disagreeable spectacle. Her thoughts a good deal
occupied with the state of the woman she had left, she
had reached the neighbourhood of her own home before
she discovered that her bag was left behind. It was a
tolerably capacious one which she usually took with
her on these expeditions, as it would carry a small

bottle of wine, or any other little matters she wished to
distribute; and as it happened, it contained on the
present occasion about five pounds in money, most of
it belonging to the society. The loss of it, therefore,
would be serious; and although it was already late,
and would involve her not being home at the usual
dinner hour, she thought, considering where the thing
was left, it would be better to return for it immediately;
so she retraced her steps as rapidly as she could, entered
the door of the house, which, for the convenience of its
various inhabitants, stood always open, and groped her
way, for it was now quite dark, towards Vennell's
room, the door of which was ajar.
'What signifies?' said a man, as Lucy, hearing his
voice, paused a moment, hesitating whether to go
forward-'what signifies? I told you they wanted
one for the lecture this evening, and there wasn't no
time to stand shilly-shally. Set on the water to boil.'
'Why couldn't you get one out o' the same place as
you got 'em afore?'
"'Cause I only got the order this morning; and it
arn't so easy, woman. There was a rumpus last
night out at Islington, where them doctors was, and
they was nigh taken; and that's why they sent to me.
Make haste with the water, will you? They'll be here
afore we're ready.'
Just as he said these words, and as Lucy, having no
notion to what their conversation alluded, was about
to advance into the room-whether it was chance, or
whether he heard some sound that awakened his sus-
picions, Vennell turned his head and saw her standing
in the passage. To rush out, seize her by the arm,
drag her into the room, and close the door, was the
work of an instant.
'Don't scream!' said the woman, darting forwards
and laying her hand on Lucy's mouth-' don't scream,
and you shan't be hurt!'
Lucy did not scream, but she answered with a
trembling voice: 'I came back for my bag!'
'I know what you came back for,' said the man; 'I
saw you awatching me in the lane just now.'
'Hush!' said the woman; she did leave her bag
here. Let her go, John-she came for no harm.'

But the man stood sullenly grasping her arm. 'Sit
down there!' he said, thrusting her towards a chair-
'Sit you down there, I say. Make yourself at home
since you are here!'
interference, so he drove forward; but the interrup-
tion seemed to have changed Vennell's purpose, for she
presently reached the end of the lane unpursued, and
making all the speed she could till she found herself in a
less dangerous neighbourhood, she stepped into a coach,
and arrived at home long after dinner-time more dead
than alive. Mr Spencer, she was informed, had been
at home, but was gone out to the lecture, very much
surprised and somewhat alarmed at her absence.
Exhausted and distressed, she went to bed, and waited
his return. At eleven o'clock he came home very tired,
for he had been out nearly the whole of the preceding
night. His first words were words of displeasure:
Why had she not been at home at dinner-time?'
'Tell me, Gerald,' she answered, where were you all
last night?'
'What is that to you?' he asked.
'It's as much to me as it is to you to know where I
have been this afternoon!'
'I beg your pardon, Lucy; I was out on business.'
'But I want to know what business."
'My dear little wife, men have often business they
cannot trust women with.'
'On this occasion, Gerald, I beseech you trust me!
I never before made any inquiries about your midnight
excursions with O'Grady, but now I have very strong
motives for doing so.'
6
'What motives?'
'Motives that concern your safety!'
'My safety, Lucy!' he rejoined in some alarm;
where is there any danger?'
'You were at Islington last night, Gerald !'
Mr Spencer, who had been sitting by the fire warming
his feet, rose and walked to the bedside.
'Who told you so, Lucy? I hope you have not been
induced by any ridiculous jealousy to spy into my
business! If you have, I shall be very angry. It's a
thing I could not put up with in a wife, however much
I loved her.'
'I see I'm right,' she said, sitting up in bed and con-
fronting him, with a pale and haggard countenance. 'I
hoped I was not. I have been praying that my sus-
picions might be unfounded. You know a man called
Vennell, Gerald?'
Vennell! What do you mean?'
'A man that lives at the back of St S Church.
He's a murderer!'
'Nonsense! I see your mistake. But what in the
world has brought you in contact with Vennell?'
'There's no mistake: I tell you he's a murderer,
and it's, you that makes him one! You've been
lectaring to-night??
Terrified into silence, she obeyed, and he went behind
her; the woman followed him, and presently she heard
a struggle, but no words. An indescribable fear that
some mischief was preparing for her made bar. turn her..

certain it was a corpse. At the same time the ivomån
was holding the man's arm, and endeavouring to wrest
something out of his hand: the room was tighted
only by one dim candle, which shed its gloomy gleams
upon this scene of horrors.
'No, John!' said the woman-'no: not if I die for
it! She's come to see me, and brought me things
through all my sickness!' But the man did not seem
disposed to relinquish his purpose, whatever it was;
when suddenly his wife made a thrust at him with all
her strength, and threw him backwards on the bed.
'Run!' she cried to Lucy-run!' making a gesture
with her head towards the door. Turn the key this
way; and as you've a soul to be saved, never tell what
you've seen this night!'
The fugitive heard the last words as she fled along
the passage into the lane; but the man was after her,
and she was not six yards in advance of him when she
heard the sound of wheels, and a hackney-coach passed.
'Save me-save me!' she cried in a frantic voice; but
either the driver did not hear her, or he thought it was
some drunken squabble which did not call for his

And you had what you call a-a subject?'
Well, if I had? I'll tell you what, Lucy,' he said
sharply, if I hadn't had subjects, you wouldn't be
Mrs Spencer; so mind your own business, and don't
be foolish!'
'Oh Gerald, Gerald, how the love of gain blinds you
to right and wrong! The man, Vennell, is a murderer,
I say; and I shouldn't be here to tell you so now but
for his wife, who enabled me to make my escape. If it
hadn't been for her, you would perhaps have found a
subject to-night on your dissecting-table you little
looked for!'
'In the name of God, what do you mean, Lucy?'
said Spencer, at length roused to a belief that there
was something more in this agitation of hers than he
had believed.
'Tell me, Gerald,' she said, 'was it a man or a woman
you had to-night?'
6
A man--at least, a boy.
'I thought so,' said Lucy shuddering. A deformed
boy?'

Yes; a deformed boy! Why?'

obscures the whole circumference of the paper circle:
this will represent the phenomenon of a total eclipse.
This experiment illustrates an invariable law of vision
Then amidst tears and anguish she told him all that
had happened: how she had visited the woman, and
how strange her demeanour had appeared; how she
had met the man and the boy, and the state of intoxi--that bodies near the eye appear larger than those at
cation the latter was in; how she had forgotten her
bag and returned for it; and finally, how she escaped.
'His fears made him misinterpret my looking back
at him; and when he saw me in the passage, he no
doubt thought I had witnessed the murder. But I
saw no blood,' she said; 'how was he killed?'
'Suffocated,' returned Mr Spencer; but I supposed
by accident. It was I that was in the coach,' he said.
'I was going to fetch the body, and I remember hear-
ing a woman cry, but I little imagined whose voice it
was !'
6
'Let us be poor to the end of our days, Gerald,' said
his wife, rather than get money by such unholy
means I'
And Mr Spencer was sufficiently shocked and
alarmed to follow her advice.
What to do about Vennell he did not know. If he
accused him, the man had it in his power to make very
unpleasant disclosures regarding himself and O'Grady;
and besides, Lucy was extremely unwilling to implicate
the unhappy wife. Finally, after some consultation, it
was agreed to warn Vennell of his danger, and then to
take such measures as would prevent a recurrence of
the crime. But the discovery of Williams and his
associates immediately afterwards led to a full exposure
of these dreadful practices, and to a more judicious
legislation, which put a stop to them by removing the
motive.
Lucy's bag was returned, with all its contents safe,
by Mrs Vennell, and the man I have called by that
name was transported at the same time that Williams
was executed. The young surgeon, whose real name is
not of course here given, rose afterwards to considerable
eminence in his profession, and, I believe, died within
the last ten years.
TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.
THE total eclipse of the sun, which takes place on the
28th of this month, is one of those phenomena of nature
which cannot be witnessed without the most intense
interest. Partial eclipses of the sun, and even the great
annular eclipse, which was so distinctly visible in this
country in 1836, though highly imposing phenomena,
are far inferior to the complete and total obscuration
of that luminary. The event is described by those who
have witnessed it as 'the most awfully grand that man
can behold, and the most interesting,' because on that
occurrence we are permitted a hasty glance at some of
the secrets of nature which cannot be seen on any
other occasion. When we read in ancient times of the
two armies of the Lydians and Medes, even in the very
midst of a furious battle, awe-struck and desisting
from the combat at the obscuration of the sun, we
cannot wonder that such a spectacle should deeply
impress more refined and more intelligent observers.
Everybody knows that an eclipse of the sun is caused
by the opaque body of the moon coming between us
and the sun; but all are not aware of the difference of
circumstances which causes at one time an annular
and at another a total eclipse: these circumstances are,
however, very easily explained. If you take a piece of
white paper, cut it into a circle of about four inches
diameter, and lay it on the table; then, standing before
it, take a penny-piece, and shutting one eye, so place
the coin between you and the paper that, looking at
both with your open eye, you see the former cover the
centre of the paper, and leave a white circle uncovered:
this will represent the phenomenon of an annular eclipse.
Then gradually move the penny-piece nearer and nearer
your eye, till it comes to within about two feet, or to a
point where the coin as now seen completely covers and
a distance; or, in other words, that objects diminish in
size as they recede from the eye or centre of vision.
Now the diameter of the sun is about 400 times larger
than that of the moon, and the mean distance of the
former luminary is about 400 times greater; so that
the diameters of the sun and moon as seen by us are
nearly the same. But as the earth's orbit is elliptical,
with the sun in one of the foci or centres, at certain
times the sun is nearer to us, and at other times
more remote; consequently his diameter increases and
diminishes somewhat to our sense of vision. It is the
same with the moon. Her orbit is also elliptical, and,
consequently, at certain periods of her revolution round
the earth, she too appears with a larger disc than at
others. When it so happens that a conjunction occurs
between the sun and moon, at a period when the moon's
disc is at its smallest and the sun's at its largest, then
the moon will not entirely obscure the sun, but a small
circular rim of this luminary will be visible: on the
other hand, when the reverse position of these bodies
occurs-that is, when the sun is at his greatest distance
from us, and his disc the smallest, while the moon is at
her nearest point to the earth, and her disc the largest
then a total eclipse of the sun is the consequence. As
the greatest difference, however, occurs on the moon's
disc, the occurrence of a total eclipse is mainly depen-
dent upon her relative position. From the well-known
laws of the moon's revolutions it is evident that eclipses,
either of the sun or moon, can only be of occasional and
comparatively rare occurrence. Still more rare must
be the concomitant circumstances which bring about a
total or even an annular eclipse.
The eclipse of next Monday will only be partial as
seen in Britain; but over a portion of the continent of
Europe it will be total. Entering Norway near Bergen,
the shadow crosses both coasts of Norway, both coasts
of Sweden, and the eastern coast of the Baltic; then
ranges through Poland and the south frontier of Russia,
across the Sea of Azof, through Georgia to the Caspian
Sea. The following towns are thus within its range:-
Christiania, Gothenburg, Carlscrona, Dantzic, Konigs-
berg, Warsaw, and Teflis. All these places are now
of easy access to travellers; and no doubt, with the
present facility of locomotion, many will indulge them-
selves in a view of the spectacle.

To those who witnessed the annular eclipse of 1836
we need not describe the general effect. The early
congregation of people of all ages out of doors on a
beautiful cloudless Sunday; the eagerness with which
the first approach of the moon's dark disc was watched;
the intense interest with which its gradual progress
was marked; the awe which the pervading gloom and
stillness as of approaching night excited; and the
singular effect which this unusual interruption of the
order of every-day nature had on the unreflecting
brute creation-birds ceasing their song, deserting
their feeding-ground, and flying to the thickets to
roost-cattle looking up in dumb amazement to the
portentous sky-and dogs whining and howling in
terror!
M. Arago strikingly describes the total eclipse of
1842. The whole circumference of the moon was seen
by him through his telescope while yet she had entered
only about two-thirds of the sun's diameter. As the
total eclipse approached, a strange fluctuation of light
was seen both by Arago and others upon the walls and
on the ground-so striking, that in some places children
ran after it, and tried to catch it with their hands. Mr
Airy, the astronomer-royal, describes the singular ring
of light which surrounded the moon's circumference,
commencing on the side of the moon opposite to that
at which the sun disappeared. In some places this

ring or corona was seen double. Its texture appeared
in some places as if fibrous or composed of entangled
thread in some places brushes or feathers of light
proceeded from it. The appearance of this luminous
ness was very striking and unaccountable. The general
opinion was, that it emanated from the sun; while
more ancient writers have supposed it to be the atmos-
phere of the moon. In the general decay and disease
which seemed to oppress all nature, the moon and the
corona appeared almost like a local disease in that part
of the sky.' But the most remarkable of all the appear-
ances were the red mountains or flames apparently
projecting from the circumference of the moon into
the inner ring of the corona. These were seen and
figured under different aspects by observers at various
stations. The first impression was, that they were
parts of the sun-elevations estimated at thirty thou-
sand miles, but then the difference of form which they
assumed as seen at different places became an objection
to this theory. M. Faye conceives these appearances
to be due to a sort of mirage or deception of vision.

every one's attention was directed to the general phe-

lost. For taking observations it may be mentioned
that no particular astronomical skill is necessary, and
few instruments-a, telescope, stop-watch, common
prism, and polariscope, include the more essential of
them. A photogenic apparatus, either Daguerreotype
or Talbotype, or both, by which a number of views

phenomenon, and at different localities, would be by
far the most interesting and useful of the observations
which travellers and men of science could contribute.

CONFESSIONS OF A PICTURE-DEALER'S HACK.
I AM going to make a clean breast of it, for the repose
of my conscience, if I may be supposed to have any,
and as some sort of laggard justice to that very nume-
rous class towards whom a stern necessity has com-
pelled me to play the impostor. I was once a student
of nature, and enthusiastic in my studies-nourishing
dreams of reputation and celebrity, with all the plea-
sant and agreeable accompaniments attendant upon
them. Long years of painful experience have, at length
brought home to my consciousness the slow and un-
willingly-acknowledged conviction, that I have wasted
the thread of life in the pursuit of a vocation never
intended for me; that, though once profoundly imbued
How this came about perhaps my history will shew.
I shall make it as brief as I honestly can: may it prove
a warning to the youthful aspirant for artistic fame,
and incite him to a candid and timely investigation
into the reality and extent of his creative faculty! One
thing I know-it will prove a revelation of some value |
to collectors and connoisseurs of all ages and grades,
provided only that they have yet modesty enough
remaining to doubt the infallibility of their judgment.
I was born in one of the suburbs of the metropolis,
and my earliest recollections are associated with the
palette and the studio. My father, whose sole child I
was, was an artist of very considerable. talent, who,'
with a real love of nature, combined a ready hand and
a facility of practice which enabled him to produce a
mother, who worshipped him with a devotion that
multitude of pictures though he died young. My
knew no bounds, relieved him of every care uncon-
nected with his pursuit. It was her business to dispose
of his productions, which, being all of small size, rarely
exceeding twenty inches in length, she carried to town,
and sold to the dealers for as much as they would bring.
In these perambulations, when I was big enough to
take the long walks, I sometimes accompanied her, and
when the sale was successful, generally got a cake or a
toy for my share. Besides my mother, my only play-
mate was a small lay-figure, which it was the quiet
delight of my childhood to cherish and fondle with an
affection which I cannot now comprehend. My father's
pictures never realised much during his life. They

work unfinished, and for three years I maintained a
hapless struggle with privations of all sorts, buoyed
up only by the fervid ambition of excellence in my art.
When the dealers would not buy my productions, I
often left them in their hands to be sold on commission.

for; but from information accidentally obtained with
regard to some few, I found that the average commis-

register of my numerous "uncles, taking care never to
appear twice at the same place with the same picture.
But this trick could not last. At the annual sale of
unredeemed pledges the walls of the auction-roon were
covered with a whole regiment of repetitions amidst
the jeers and hootings of the assembled bidders. My
plan was blown, and I dared not shew my face to a
pawnbroker. It was vain to send pictures to be pledged
by another hand, the fellows knew my touch too well
to be deceived. I tried again with original sketches,
but it was of no use: everybody believed that I had a
score of reduplications in store; and I was forced at
length to abandon the pawnbrokers to their discri-
mination. I returned again to the dealers, but each
and all had a copy of my windmill, old boat, and white
horse hanging upon hand; and, pronouncing my pro-
ductions unsaleable, declined to purchase. In this
dilemma I was driven to the slaughter - houses,' or
nightly auctions which are opened weekly at the West
End, and constitute the last wretched refuge and
resource of destitute daubers. Here I figured for some
time, wasting my days in unprofitable attempts to meet
the demands of a miserable market. I grew shabby and
dispirited, and sank into the depths of poverty. Often
I could not meet the expense of canvas, and painted on
paper or millboard, or even on an old shirt stretched
upon a worm-eaten strainer, begged or bought for a
few halfpence from the liners' journeymen. Sometimes,
aroused to exertion by a rekindling love of art, I would
walk up to Hampstead or out to Norwood, and bringing
back a subject, paint it up with all my old enthusiasm ;
but it availed me nothing: the picture was generally
sacrificed for a few shillings; and even though it were
With this view, when the term of my indentures
had run out, I bade adieu to my uncle, who made no
attempt to alter my purpose, and commenced the
world on my own, accoumt, devoting my whole time
and energies to my favourite pursuit. I first painted
a couple of pieces of a small size, and sent them to the
Street Exhibition, paying the then customary
fee, which a wiser policy has since, abolished. I felt
overjoyed to hear that my pictures were hung, and
hastened to look at them as soon as the doors were
opened to the public. My hopes were dashed away by
the sight of my two little productions, hardly covering
more than a square foot of canvas each, suspended as
telescopic objects high aloft beneath the gloom of the
ceiling; while whole fathoms of the sight line were
choked up with the unmitigated abominations,' as the
reviewers justly styled them, of one of the members of
the committee, whom nature had cut out for a scavenger.

afterwards sold for a fair price, the profit had been
shared in the knock-out, and I was none the better.
In this exigency I gladly complied with an offer made
me by Mr Grabb, a carver and gilder with whom it had
been my wont at times to exchange pictures for frames.
In addition to his regular business he dealt in pictures
to a great extent, had a large country connection, and,
living himself in Soho, kept an extra shop in the city,
where he always made an extraordinary show of colour
and gilding on dividend days, with the especial design
of catching the country gabies,' as he called them,
cash in hand. With him I boarded and lodged, and
received a small weekly salary, in return for which I
was to occupy myself ten hours a day in making
new pictures or restoring old ones, according to the
demand. He had picked me up just in time for his
purpose. A day or two after I entered upon my
duties, he encountered a country baronet at a sale
which had lasted for nearly a week. The man of
title had bought between 200 and 300 lots, with the
view of decorating a mansion which he was then
building in Sussex; and having no place at hand to
contain his numerous purchases, had accepted the
ready offer of my patron to warehouse them for him
for a season. The purchases arrived on the day of
clearance, and with them the delighted owner, who had
bought a whole gallery-full for about L.500. They
were all stacked in the silvering-room, and my employer
was commissioned to select such of the number as he
judged would do credit to the taste of the possessor, to
restore them to a good condition, to regild the frames
of such as required it, and to dispose of the rejected
pieces for what they would fetch, carrying the proceeds
as a set-off against his bill. Mr Grabb knew perfectly
well what to do with such a commission. The next
day I was summoned to a consultation, and having
locked the doors, the whole batch was gone over, and
carefully scrutinised with the aid of a bowl of water
and a sponge. All the large pictures (some were as
big as the side of a room), many of which I felt bound
to condemn as worthless, were set aside for repair and
framing; while a select collection, amounting to about
thirty of the smallest, best, and most saleable cabinet
sizes, were thrown into a corner as unworthy of atten-
tion. For these, which were nearly worth all the rest
of the collection put together, he ultimately made an
allowance of L.15 off his bill, amounting to several
hundreds, the cost of gorgeous frames and gilding for
trumpery of no value. It took me four months to
prepare such of the pictures as wanted cleaning for
their gilded jackets, and it would have taken as many
years had proper care and leisure been allowed for the
operation; but I was admonished to follow a very sum-
mary process-to get off the dirt and old varnish from
the lights, and to leave the shadows to shift for them-
selves, trusting to a good coat of varnish to blend the
whole. One immense sea-fight, which defied all our
solvents to disturb its crust, Grabb undertook himself.
Stripping it from the stretcher, he laid it flat on the
silvering-slab, and splashing water on its surface, seized
a mass of pumicestone twice as big as his fist, and
scrubbed away with bare arms, like a housemaid at a
kitchen-floor, until admonished by the tinge of the
water that he had done enough. The canvas was then
restrained, and turned over to me to paint again what
he had scoured away. As the whole rigging of a
seventy-four was clean gone, I began the slow process
of renewing it; but he would not hear of that, but bade
me bury everything in a cloud of smoke as the shorter
way of getting over the business. When the whole
were ultimately carted home and hung up in his new
residence, the baronet was delighted with his gallery,
and with this picture in particular, which certainly
differed more than any of the others from its original
appearance.
The baronet's commission being now settled and
done with, the rejected pictures were withdrawn from
their hiding-place and confided with many precautions
to my most careful treatment. I laboured con amore in
their restoration, and Grabb reaped a little fortune by
their disposal. He kept me well employed. Every
picture which came in to be framed or repaired, if he
judged the subject saleable, was transferred to me for
copying, and sorry indeed should I be to swear that the
original invariably found its way back to the owner.
Soon after my domiciliation at Grabb's my uncle left
Charlotte Street, and with a large cargo of English
pictures emigrated to New York, where he sold his
venture to good advantage. In one of the southern
cities he found patronage and a wife, and grew into
consideration ere he died.
I remained seven years with Grabb, and during that
period attained a wonderful facility in the production of
copies, and so close an acquaintance with the method
and handling of some of the living London artists, as
occasionally perplexed even themselves. This talent
my employer turned to good account by selling forgeries
of mine as the original sketches of painters of note and
reputation; and at the decease of any one of them lie
supplied me with canvas and panels procured from the
colourmen they had dealt with, and set me about the
manufacture of sketches and unfinished pictures, which
were readily bought up as the relics of celebrated
geniuses.
At the close of my seventh year business fell short,
True there was plenty for me to do, but owing to
distress in the manufacturing districts, the sale of
pictures, as is invariably the case at such seasons, very
much declined. Still my principal managed to get rid
of his stock, though not in the regular way of business:
he packed off a portion of his best goods to country
agents, and to old customers on approval, and crammed
the shop in the city to overflowing, where also he took
to sleeping at night, leaving me and the shop-boy sole
guardians of the house in Soho. One morning about
two o'clock, while soundly sleeping in my garret, I was
aroused from my rest by a thundering noise at my
room door, and the affrighted cries of the boy, calling
upon me to arise and save myself, for the house was on
fire. I dashed out of bed, contrived to huddle on a
portion of my clothes, and opened the door. The room
was instantly filled with smoke; the boy had already
escaped through the trap-door in the roof, which, being
left open, acted as a flue to the fire, the flames of which
were rapidly ascending the stairs. I had no time for
reflection, nor sufficient presence of mind to snatch, as
I might have done, the few pounds I had hoarded from
my drawer; but scrambling after him as I best might,
found myself in a few minutes shivering on the roof of
a neighbour's house, in my shirt and trousers, now my
sole worldly possessions. A servant-girl let us in at a
garret window, and I immediately despatched the boy
for his master, whom, however, I did not see till the
morning, when he coolly informed me that he was a
ruined man, and that I must look out for some other
employer. He paid me a small arrear of wages due,
and gave me a faded suit of his own to begin the world
afresh. I may add that Grabb subsequently received
two thousand pounds insurance money; that in two
years after he was so unfortunate as to be burned out
again, and received fifteen hundred; that he was over-
taken by the same calamity twice afterwards in New
York; and returning again to London, was again
burned out: whereupon the office in which he had
insured politely informed him that he might recover
the money if he could in a court of justice--they should
not else pay it. He never instituted any proceedings,
but carried on business for ten years without insurance
and without accident.
I could not afford to remain long idle; and being
now pretty well known to a certain portion of the
trade, I was not long of obtaining employment. My

next engagement was with Sapper, who kept a shop
for the sale of pictures, together with large warehouses,
in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. I thought
myself pretty well versed in the art and mystery of
picture-making, and conceived that after my long
experience under Grabb I had little if anything left to
learn. This worthy undeceived me effectually. In my
former place I had been the only hand; here I found
three companions, each far more experienced and more
clever than myself. One, a gentleman-like old fellow,
painted nothing but Morlands from one year's end to the
other. He had been a contemporary of that eccentric
genius, and had mastered his style so effectually that he
would have deceived even me had I met with his for-
geries elsewhere. He was provided with a complete port-
folio of every piece of Morland's which had ever been
engraved, besides a considerable number of his original
chalk drawings; he had, moreover, pentagraphed out-
lines of the known size of the original paintings, which
outlines were transferred to the canvas in a few minutes
by means of tracing-paper, and painted in from the
prints, which were all slightly tinted after the originals
for his guidance. A man of about five-and-forty, a
Manchester artist, of thorough training and admirable
skill in his department, did duty every morning from
eight till twelve o'clock as the celebrated Greuze; after
that hour he disappeared, to attend to his own practice
as a portrait-painter. I recognised at once in his work
the source of the numerous admirable transcripts of
that master which I had been for years in the habit of
occasionally encountering both in sale-rooms and pri-
vate collections. The third was a Dutchman, whom
Sapper had picked up on a picture-tour in Holland,
and engaged from admiration of his marvellous imita-
tions of Teniers, whose works, with others of a similar
school, he was constantly employed in imitating with
astonishing fidelity and success.
Among these companions I was directed to set up
my easel and commence operations; and a small pic-
ture of Patrick Nasmyth was put into my hand to be
copied in duplicate. I was directed to mix a certain
substance with every tint that was laid on with any
thickness, to insure its drying speedily as hard as a
brick,' lest the finger-nail of a wide-awake customer
should detect the softness of new colour. The panels
put into my hands, though snow-white with the pre-
pared ground on the one side, were black with age on
the other, and spotted over here and there with the
cracked sealing-wax impressions of well-known con-
noisseurs, to intimate that the picture I was about to
commence had already passed through the hands of
several collectors of repute. When I had finished them,
both being done within a week, they were, after a few
days' drying, slightly glazed with a weak solution of
liquorice to give them tone: one was varnished, framed,
and readily sold from the window; the other laid by in
a garret, to await, with a hundred more, its turn for
exportation. My next job was a magnificent Cuyp,
which had not many weeks before been knocked down
by auction for eight hundred guineas, and which was
confided to Sapper for the purpose of removing the old
varnish and substituting new, and for framing. As
nothing else was required to be done, the picture might
have been returned to the proprietor within a week or
ten days; but Sapper determined from the moment he
saw it to possess a facsimile, and I was set about the
manufacture of one forthwith. A panel was prepared of
the precise age, from three oak planks selected from the
stores of a dealer in old houses, and dyed to the required
tint by a strong infusion of tobacco. By means of new
bread kneaded in the hand the two broad burgomaster's
seals on the back were counterfeited beyond the possi-
bility of detection, and I commenced upon the surface
with all the industry and skill I was master of, stimu-
lated to the task by the prospect of an extra guinea.
The picture had been promised to the owner in a week,
my employer knowing well enough that it would take
me four or five weeks at least to make the copy. It
was in vain that one message after another came to
urge the return of the picture, and that the owner him-
self drove up in his carriage, and remonstrated in no
measured terms with Sapper, and threatened him with
the interference of the law. The knave had a reply
ever ready upon his lips: 'He was determined to do
justice to so exquisite a work of art, and he would not,
he could not, be induced to hurry it; his reputation
would suffer should any mischief happen to the paint-
ing; which he would prevent, in this case at least, even
at the risk of disobliging his patron.' At length, after
nearly six weeks' delay, I had completed the copy; and
then Sapper himself, in less than an hour, licked off
all the old varnish with a wisp of wadding steeped in
the doctor,' gave it a new coat of mastic, clapped it
into an elegant and appropriate frame, and despatched
a note to the proprietor requesting his attendance and
approval. He came, and was delighted with the aspect
of his picture; while the dealer, with a thousand modest
apologies for the delay, assured him that the task had
been one of great labour and anxiety both to him and
me, and that he could not, consistently with justice to
the master, have accomplished it sooner. The wealthy
connoisseur swallowed his lies with evident relish and
satisfaction, reiterated his thanks again and again for
the marvellous manner in which the picture had been
got up, and paid at the same time a bouncing bill for
a process which a crown would have amply recom-
pensed. There remained now nothing to be done to
the copy in order to render it a tolerable facsimile of
the original, but to imitate the close reticulation of
cracks-the ineffaceable work of time-which covered
every square inch of the surface. This was accom-
plished in the following manner:-After the copy had
stood to dry for a fortnight, by which time, thanks to
certain nostrums ground up with the colours, the whole
had grown as hard as a pantile, it was taken down,
slightly toned with a warm brown to give it age, and
when again dry, carefully coated with size; the com-
position of which, as it is already too well known among
the knaves of the profession, and can be of no manner
of utility to any honest man, I may be excused from
explaining. This was no sooner tolerably dry, than it
was followed by a liberal coating of varnish floated over
the surface, and left to harden in a room free from
dust. The inevitable result from such a process is,
that the varnish is no sooner set than it begins to crack,
owing to the expansion of the understratum of size;
and this cracking may be regulated by an experienced
hand, in varying the proportions of the ingredients
used in compounding the size, and in other ways, so
as to give rise to fissures of all widths, from the thick-
ness of a hair, as exhibited on the panels of the Dutch-
men, to that of a crown-piece, as they are beheld in
the present condition of most of the works of Sir Joshua
Reynolds. With the width of the cracks the size of
the reticulations also varies; ranging from the diameter
of a small shot to that of the palm of the hand. When
very fine, the cracks are not visible until made so by
rubbing impurities into them, for which purpose the
dust which settles upon a polished table, wiped up with
an old silk handkerchief slightly oiled, is usually pre-
ferred. The difference between a picture thus cracked
by artifice and one cracked by the operation of years
or centuries cannot, other things being equal, be pos-
sibly discerned by the closest inspection. The only
way to get at the imposture would be to remove the
varnish, either by friction or solvents, when the fissures
would be found in the true picture to extend through
the paint, while from the manufactured copy they
would disappear with the varnish--a rule, however,
which would not be without exceptions.

them, but because the young fellow, whose business it
was to line canvases and prepare panels for us all to
work upon, had been out on one of his periodical
drunken bouts, and had nothing ready for him. Sapper,
coming up and seeing him idle, requested him to go
to a broker's in Red Lion Street and crab' a picture
for him, as he wanted to buy it. When the old fellow
had gone off on his errand, I asked the Greuze what
he was gone after. "Oh,' said he, the broker wants
L.10 for a bit of Gainsborough, and the governor
wants it for fifty shillings-that's all.' I soon found
that crabbing' is the art of putting a man wanting
judgment in the article he deals in out of conceit with
his goods. Two or three accidental inquiries, with de-
monstrations of amazement at the enormous' price
asked, are found materially to lower the demands of
the seller. In this instance, Sapper eventually suc-
ceeded in getting the picture he wanted at his own
price; and after disposing of several copies in various
quarters, ultimately sold it again for its full value.,
He sold pictures on commission; and these he
managed, when it was worth his while, with a com-
plex kind of adroitness which is worth recording. I
shall chronicle one instance a gentleman who had
given L.800 for a famous production of one of our first
living artists, grew discontented with its too great size,
and sent it to Sapper to be disposed of, professing him-
self willing to lose L.100. by the sale, but not more.
Sapper offered it for L.1000, and at length obtained
a bidding of L.700, which, as he observed, would
have left nothing for himself. He immediately wrote
to the owner, informing him that he had an offer
of L.200 and a fine Claude, which he requested him
to come and inspect, as he did not like to refuse
the offer without the owner's sanction. Meanwhile
one of Hofland's beautiful transcripts of Claude,
procured in exchange at the nominal price of sixty
guineas, was mounted on the easel, and, covered with a
curtain, awaited the inspection of the victim. He
came, and, deceived by the really fine execution of the
picture-the counterfeited cracks of age, the palpably
Italian style of lining, in which Sapper was skilled to a
miracle, and the Roman frame and gilding-concluded
the transaction, giving the rogue a small commission
for his trouble, who, in addition to that, pocketed the
difference between L.500 and the value of the pretended
Claude, which would have been well sold at L.50.
6
Though Sapper's house was filled with works of art
of every imaginable description, overflowing with pic-
tures from the cellar to the garret, including every
species of rubbish gathered from the holes and corners
of half Europe, yet the contents of his dwelling afforded
but an inadequate idea of the extent of his stock. He
had plants in the hands of numerous petty agents,
the owners of small shops in suburban highways, who
sold for a trifling per-centage. He had here a
Madona and there a Holy Family in the keeping of a
lone widow or a decayed spinster, whispered about as
pieces of great value, which the holders were compelled
to part with from the pressure of domestic misfortune
or embarrassment; he had traps and baits lying in
wait for the inevitable though long-deferred rencontre
of customers whom bitter experience had rendered
wary, and who had long ceased buying in the regular
market; and he had collections snugly warehoused in
half the large towns of the empire, waiting but the
wished-for crisis of commercial prosperity to be cata-
logued and sold as the unique collection of some lately
for convenience
defunct connoisseur, removed to
of sale.
Among the acres of what he called his gallery pic-
tures was one with an area of some hundred square
feet, upon which he had bestowed the names of Rubens
and Snyders. It had hung for years upon hand, and
was at length disposed of by the following ingenious
ruse-A gentleman who had appeared at different
times desirous of treating for it-now negotiating an
exchange, now chaffering for a cash price-hovering on
the edge of a resolution, like Prior's malefactor on the
gallows cart-at length absented himself, and with-
drawing on a visit to B, appeared to have re-
linquished the idea of dealing. Sapper, knowing that
a picture-sale was shortly coming off in the town to
which his dallying customer had flown, and knowing,
too, that he could do as he chose with the auctioneer,
who was an old chum, followed close upon the heels of
the tardy bidder, taking the enormous picture with
him. As the cunning rogue had calculated, the in-
stincts of the would-be-buyer led him to the sale-room,
where his astonishment was unbounded at beholding the
picture he had so long coveted at length condemned to
the hammer. On the following day, when the sale canie
on, Sapper, who had not shewn his face in the town,
lay ensconsed in a snug box behind the fence over
concealed from view, he ran up the picture against the
which the lots were consecutively hoisted, and here,
eager bidder to the full sum he had offered for it in
London, and bought it in against him in the name of
an Irish nobleman. So soon as the doors were shut,
the picture was again off to London, and the next day
appeared in its usual place on the wall of the staircase.
In a fortnight after the gentleman walks into the shop,
exclaiming: Ha, Sapper, so you have parted with the
picture you might as well have closed with my offer."
I don't understand you,', said the other-I have
parted with no picture that I know of which you had
any inclination for.'
gentle-
I mean the Rubens and Snyders, replied the
man; it was sold at B about a fortnight ago, and
fetched about what I offered for it. I must know, for
was there myself, and bid for it,"
up
I don't pretend to contradict you, sir,' retorted
Sapper; all I know is, that the picture you speak of
has never been out of my house, and, what is more, is
not likely to go, unless I get my price for it. Now I
think of it, there was a young fellow, from B-
here last summer, who gave me ten pounds for permis-
sion to copy it; and a capital copy he made had I
known he was so good a hand I should not have let
him do it for the money. You will find the picture in
its place if you like to step and look at it.
Up walks the bewildered gentleman, and can scarcely
believe his eyes at beholding the old favourite in its old
place. Sapper follows with a sponge and water, and
copy
cleaning down the face of the painting, expresses his
astonishment that any one should mistake a
however cleverly done, for such a fine work as that;
adding, that if the copy brought so good a sum under
the hammer, what must be the actual value of the
original? The inference was inevitable, and the speedy
result was the consummation of the purchase, not with-
out some show of unwillingness on the part of Sapper,
who appeared impressed with the notion that he was
submitting to a tremendous sacrifice,
I cannot, nor need I, continue these details. I have
said enough to warn the unwary, and to arouse the
watchfulness of the wise. Is it wonderful that the
moral atmosphere in which I have lived, and moved,
and had my being, should have had the effect upon my
mind which I have described at the commencement of
this paper? When connoisseurs and critics stand
gasping with breathless raptures in contemplation of
slimy mixtures of megilp and burned bones; when they
solemnly invoke the shades of the mighty dead, and eja-
culate their maudlin rhapsodies in reverential whispers,
as though hushed to silence by the spirit of departed
genius in the presence of a rascally forgery perpetrated
for a wage of thirty shillings-what marvel if one whom
hunger and necessity have driven to deceit should lose
all capacity for the proper appreciation of art or nature
cither, and should at last be able to look at both only
through the prostituted means and materials which

10 THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON.
TURITY YTICA9 5 ft d
July 1851.
THE Census has been a prominent subject of talk from
the time that the Registrar-General made the facts
public. They have been examined, commented on, and
discussed in various ways by the Statistical Society
and others and many and important are the con-
sequent deductions. Looking at the rapid increase
and spread of the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides
of the Atlantic and in the southern hemisphere, we
are told that this race and the English language are to
become predominant among the nations and tongues
of the earth. Notwithstanding the going forth of
emigrants by hundreds of thousands from our shores
during the past ten years, the population of Britain
has increased 2,263,550 since 1841. In London at the
last census the numbers were 1,948,369 now they
amount to 2,363,141; and who shall assign a limit to
the further multiplication? While it lasts, the great
metropolis becomes year by year a more remarkable
and interesting phenomenon a mightier subject of
study for the reflective mind. One fact as to the country
at large has already given rise to a little serious in-
quiry: the returns shew that tliere are half a million
more females than males; and social philosophers are
beginning to wonder what is to become of them."
The Census, however, as well as most other topics,
is thrown into the shade by the Exhibition, which
still continues to be the subject of gossip. The objects
on show, the
he throngs of visitors, the daily-enlarging
experiences as to
to the practicability and philosophy
of great gatherings, form infinite themes of discussion
and remark. According to some, certain beneficial
moral effects are beginning to be apparent. Meantime
our learned societies have pursued the even tenor of
their way without any more striking change than that
of an occasional sprinkling of moustached foreigners
at their meetings. The Royal Society have held their
election meeting, and admitted fifteen out of nearly
forty candidates to the honour of fellowship, and they,
in common with other distinguished confraternities,
have brought their session to a close. Their president,
Lord Rosse, has given the last of his four soirées; and
weary officials are full of self-gratulation at the pros-
pect of a breathing time. And truly there are many
who need it; for the whirl and excitement of parties,
conversaziones, &c. are so continuous and overwhelming,
that it is only by going to two or three in the course
of an evening that some people manage to render the
courtèsies expected of them, and to conciliate their
friends acquaintances. What should we do were it
not for the beauty and quiet of the country?
Happily the turmoil is not universal, as you may
judge by the steady way in which scientific research
and philosophical investigation are maintained. For
example: Let ocean steam-navigators take courage, for
it is now an ascertained fact that, in addition to the
deposits in several islands of the Indian Archipelago,
coal exists in abundance in the Corean peninsula of
China. Surprise has at times been expressed that coal
should be found in the torrid zone: if a final cause of
a very special nature were necessary in the case, it
might be found in the maintenance and multiplication
of steamers on the great oceans. Another fact from the
East is one to which, as the readers of 'Cosmos' will
remember, Humboldt attaches some importance the
line of perpetual snow on the Himalayas. It appears
from recent explorations by Lieutenant Strachey, that
on the southern edge this line is at an elevation of
15,000 feet, and at 18,500 on the northern; while on
the mountains to the north of the Sutlej it rises to
19,000 feet. Thus an inquiry of some interest in phy-
sical geography may be considered as settled, subject
of course to revision by future explorers.
"
Lieutenant Gilliss, who, as I told you some time ago,
is at the head of an astronomical expedition sent out
by the United States to South America, has written an
account of the late earthquake at Valparaiso. He says
that, for several days before and after, there were
extraordinary fluctuations of the barometer, and over-
cast weather. Finding the instrument made for mea-
suring the intensity of shocks fail in its indications, he
constructed a pendulum more than nine feet long,
supported on a triangle, with a needle inserted in the
lower part of the bob, which,' to quote his description,
just touches a sheet of glazed paper marked with
concentric circles and the points of the compass. The
paper lies on a horizontal plate of glass resting on the
earth, and is sprinkled with black sand, so that the
motion of the pendulum leaves a white line exposed.
It is to be 1 regretted that the paper had not been
secured to the earth, for during the shock there was a
displacement bodily of about half an inch; but we
have a distinct ellipse, whose diameters are 3.5 inches
and 2-4 inches, and positive evidence that the motion
of the disturbing force was in a line varying little from
north by cast to south by west, or contrary to the
supposed direction in which the earth-wave has moved
in all preceding great disturbances. These facts are
the more interesting at the present time, as the sub-
ject of an earthquake - ometer has been more than
once discussed at the late meetings of the British
Association.
1... 1.
To pass from South to North America, there is the
usual assortment of notions from the United States,
among which not the least curious is the fact that not
fewer than twenty-one applications for patents for
churns were made in the course of last year. Most of
these utensils were what is called 'atmospheric churns,'
which means that they were contrived so that in the
process of churning air was interfused with the cream,
by which a more complete agitation was effected, and
the butter more quickly produced than by the ordinary
way. A common churn, it is said, may be converted
into an atmospheric, by piercing a hole from one
extremity of the dasher to the other, and placing a
valve at the bottom to open downwards only. If the
dasher be raised quickly, air and not cream rushes into
the opening, and on the descent is pressed out laterally,
and escapes through the whole mass of the cream, which
appears as though it were boiling violently. On some
occasions, when the question as to performance and
principle between any two churns became delicate, the
inventors were required to make butter in the Patent
Office at Washington; and once there was held a churn
race between a patented and a new churn, in which
they both came out alike, making butter from new
milk in two-and-a-half minutes.' But as the com-
missioner appointed to decide on the merits of the case
reports: Such a rapid separation of the butter is by no
means desirable, although this is the general aim of
these improvements. We have it upon the highest
chemical authority, that butter made so rapidly is not
likely to be as good as that which is made slowly.'
Thus it would appear that there is a limit to the time
of butter-making, not to be overpassed without prejudice
to the article-a fact worthy of consideration by those
who hold quick production to be the best.

In certain quarters, chiefly among those who are
food-providers, M. Masson's experiments are exciting
attention. He is gardener-in-chief to the Horti-
cultural Society of France, and has announced a
method for preserving alimentary vegetable substances,
the result of ten years' study, in which the bulk of the

vegetable is reduced without altering its constitution.
The process is one of desiccation in stoves at a low
temperature, followed by powerful compression in a
hydraulic press. The first operation, as the author
describes, deprives the substances of their superabun-
dant moisture, which, in cabbages and certain roots,
amounts to 80 or 85 per cent. of the whole bulk. By
the second their volume is much reduced, and the
density increased until it resembles that of pine-wood,
thereby facilitating preservation, packing, and trans-
port.
When required for use, the substance has only to be
soaked in tepid water for thirty or forty minutes, and
cooked and seasoned in the usual way. Vegetables so
preserved have been tried in the French navy; a case
of cabbage taken on board the corvette Astrolabe in
January 1847 was opened in January 1851, and on
being dressed was found to be of excellent flavour.'
All the cakes were in good condition; some of them
absorbed six and a half times their weight of water.
M. Masson states that his process admits of appli-
cation to all green vegetables, as well as to roots, tubers,
and fruits. If emigration is to go on as of late, com-
pressed vegetables would supply a most essential
aliment to thousands who have now to undergo severe
privations and the risk of disease whether on land or
water. With these, and the 'meat biscuit' recently
introduced from America, and the bread made at
Toulouse by certain ingenious bakers from the gluten
hitherto wasted in starch factories, one might bid
defiance to famine.
Messrs Gratiolet and Cloez have submitted to the
Académie a 'Note on the venomous properties of the
lactescent humour secreted in the cutaneous pustules of
the terrestrial salamander and common toad,' in which
it is shewn that the popular belief regarding the
nature of the animals in question is not without foun-
dation. They first observed that several frogs which had
been shut up with salamanders (efts) in a barrel, were
found dead at the end of a week; and having collected
a pure white liquid from the pustules of the salamanders,
a small quantity was inserted under the leg or wing of
a bird. No immediate inconvenience was perceived,
but after a few minutes the creatures operated on were
seen to stagger, to open and shut the beak convulsively,
to erect their feathers, utter plaintive cries, and die in
extreme agony. A yellow-hammer thus treated died
in three minutes, a turtle-dove in twenty minutes, a
chaffinch in twenty-five; most of the birds, however,
died in six or seven minutes. Strangely enough, the
poison does not appear to be fatal to quadrupeds: even
mice escape; but all undergo great suffering.
The poison of the toad (Rana bufo) is yellowish, and
insupportably bitter in taste. It killed greenfinches
and chaffinches in from five to six minutes after inocu-
lation; thus shewing the two poisons to be equally
energetic in their action on birds, with this difference,
that convulsions are produced by that of the salamander
but not by that of the toad. The two authors are
pursuing the inquiry into this interesting subject;
when they publish anything further worth recording, I
shall not fail to acquaint you with it.
Three other savans have been making Experi-
mental researches on the modifications produced in
the animal temperature by the introduction of different
therapeutic agents into the animal economy? Sul-
phate of copper, according to their testimony, has
a constant lowering effect, which remains for ten
or twelve hours. Tartar-emetic, whether in the
stomach or the blood, elevates the temperature when
taken in minute doses, while larger doses depress.
With ipecacuanha the effect is precisely reversed: it
is the largest dose which most raises the temperature.
Two drops of croton oil first lower, then elevate. Twelve
drops produce a reduction of five degrees of tempera-
ture in the course of two hours. These are but a few
|
selected from numerous experiments which are still
carried on, as having an important bearing on medical
practice-sufficient, however, to give you an idea of
their nature. I must just add, before quitting this
part of the subject, that M. Carnot states that
vaccination only serves to displace, not to diminish
mortality. He believes that the practice of inocula-
tion, and the varioloid eruption consequent thereupon,
prevented those gastro-intestinal diseases which are
now so frequent and fatal to persons from twenty to
thirty years of age. Let the doctors look to it.

M. Babinet has been investigating mathematically
the Relation of temperature to the development of
plants.' It is a question that has been discussed over
and over again, and is still debatable. The postulate
is, that every plant starting from a certain tempera-
ture requires the same amount of heat for its equal
development.' Thus the point to be first determined
was this starting temperature, which of course varies
with different plants, and then to estimate the amount
of heat necessary to advance the plant from germina-
tion to florescence and fructification. It is known that
150 days at a temperature of 60 degrees will effect as
much as 100 days at 70 degrees. M. Babinet shews,
in a way only to be understood by mathematicians,
that the point of departure may be determined by
mathematical formulæ, and considers that a much
greater increment of heat is necessary for the full
development than has been thought of by others who
have studied the same subject. While they decide that
two or even one degree is sufficient, he holds that six
are necessary. In these days of land reclamation and
agricultural enterprise such a question becomes im-
portant. Its decision will indicate how far north a
farmer may plant and sow with hope of success.
Apropos of cultivation, we are promised a plan, by a
Frenchman, for destroying insects hurtful to grain;
and M. Guérin-Méneville, whose name I have fre-
quently introduced to your notice, has published
certain practical observations on the silk-worm in
health and disease, and the best means to improve the
breed: he also proposes a method to prevent the
boring-worm, by which olive-trees are infested, from
pursuing its depredations. Further, and apropos of
botany, Professor Blüme of Leyden has just presented
to the Académie his valuable work, in several volumes,
on the Dutch plants of the Eastern Archipelago.
Among others he treats of the different kinds of upas
-a tree of which we used to read with horror in our
schoolboy days. They are all more or less poisonous
in their juices; but, as M. Blüme shews, the stories
about the noxious vapours destroying the birds that
fly over them are mere inventions, for birds build
their nests and rear their young as comfortably in the
branches of the upas as in any other tree. He adds
that the volcanic soil of Java in certain places emits a
deleterious gas, the effects of which have been mis-
takenly attributed to the trees.
Photography is being pursued with such vigour as
to shew that erelong it will compete powerfully with
the arts of engraving and printing. M. Bayard is
working at the problem, 'To render the positive paper
highly impressionable under the action of a light
relatively very feeble.' By his process he gets copies
of the positive impression in one second by the sun,
and in less than an hour by a carcel lamp. And
according to M. Blanquart Evrard of Lille, copies of
the negative impression may be taken at the rate of
200 or 300 per day, and sold for one penny or two-
pence. If he can really do what he says, how perfect
and exact we may hope to have the illustrations of
books!
To turn to another topic, M. Pierre Landry applies
hygienic laws to the construction of towns and cities,
and submits a plan to the Académie which is to satisfy
all the needs of health, &c. Taking a town situate on

which commonly traverses the town is contrived so as
to form the three principal streets which comprise the
town within them; 2. The public edifices necessary to
the whole town are grouped at the centre, and thus
realise a spacious reservoir of air and sunshine;
3. The streets composing the town are planned around
the public edifices, avoiding exposure to the north;

Thou shalt have a ticket to-day, for they are going

'Ah, thank you, monsieur! What laughing I shall

'Yes; the poor old man, who but for thy charity
would not have had a morsel to eat to-day, will this

none of them will inquire about his destiny.'
'But, monsieur, do not your pieces bring you
money?'
By this plan, as the inventor sums up, 'every one
has the sun, pure air, a picturesque prospect, and the
maximum of hygienic conditions; and the causes of
disease arising out of vicious construction may be made
to disappear from towns.' It must be remembered that
M. Landry writes for French readers. The question

STORY OF A DRAMATIST.
ONE cold morning in February 1810, a short, stout,
commonplace - looking man, about sixty years old,
entered the garden of an inn situated in the suburbs
of Paris. Although the air was sharp and frosty, he
seated himself near one of the tables placed out of
doors, and taking off his hat, passed his fingers through
his long gray hairs.
His hands contrasted strangely with the remainder
of his person: they were small, white, and terminated
in such delicately-formed pink nails as might excite
the envy of many a young lady. Presently one of the
waiters came up, and placed before him a bottle of
wine.
'I
'Not any to-day, thank you,' said the old man.
feel fatigued, and will just rest for a moment.'
"The best way of resting, monsieur,' replied the
waiter gaily, 'is to drink a good glass of wine.'
He drew the cork, and poured out some of the wine.
The old man rose and walked away. The waiter
was a young lad, and it was with a confused and
´embarrassed air that he ran after the guest and said:
'Sir, there is credit for you at the Lion d'Or; if you
have forgotten your purse, that's no reason you should
lose your breakfast. To-morrow, or whenever you
like, you can ask for the bill.'
The old man turned, looked at the youth, and a tear
sparkled in his eye. Thou art right, Jean,' he said;
'poverty must not be proud. I accept thy kindness as
frankly as it is offered. Help thyself to a glass of wine.'
'I drink to your very good health, monsieur,' said
the waiter; and having emptied his glass, he went and
fetched some spiced meat, bread, cheese, fruit, and
everything necessary for a tempting and nourishing
repast; then with native politeness, in order to lessen
the painful sense of obligation to his guest, he said:
When next one of your pieces is played, will you give
me a ticket?'
Thou shalt have two this yery evening, my good
So.
The band was playing a lively air, and in the midst
of the troops rode in the place of honour a general
dressed in a magnificent uniform, and mounted on a
splendid Andalusian charger. Happening as he passed
to cast a glance at Dorvigny, he uttered a loud excla-
mation of surprise. Without heeding his soldiers he

'General!'
'A general is accustomed to be punctually obeyed.
I arrest you as my prisoner. Go,' he continued,
addressing a soldier, 'fetch me a carriage, and lead my
horse home. Now, Monsieur Dorvigny, step in.'
Half-laughing, half-resisting, the old man took his
place in the carriage next the general. 'Do you re-
member,' said the latter as they drove on,' the day that
I left your service, because, as you told me, you were
no longer rich enough to keep a servant? I tried my
fortune in several situations, but did not find any
master so lenient towards my faults as you; so as a
last resource I enlisted in a regiment. I was jeered by
my comrades for my awkwardness, and for many
months led an unhappy life; until one day we found
ourselves at Bormio in the Valteline, facing a redoubt
which opened a murderous fire on our ranks. The
order was given to advance, and we rushed to the
attack; but presently most of our men were mowed
down, and those who escaped hesitated and drew back.
I threw myself alone into the redoubt, shouting:
"Follow me, boys!" They did so. The Austrians,
astonished at this unlooked - for attack, fled, and we
took twelve pieces of cannon. The same day I was
made a sergeant; and afterwards, by degrees and the
fortunes of war, rose to the rank I now occupy.
Perhaps I may get still higher!'
Dorvigny was installed by the general in a pleasant
apartment next his own, and for some time the old
man enjoyed all the comforts and luxuries of life. At
length his friend received an order to set out for Russia.
During the first three months of the campaign General
Dubois sent letters and remittances to his former mas-
ter, but they suddenly ceased, and one morning, from
the column of a newspaper, Dorvigny learned that his
friend had fallen at Moscow.
He was forced to leave his pleasant lodging, and take
refuge in an attic in an obscure part of Paris. There,
after having sold the coat off his back, overwhelmed
with age and illness, he went to the proprietor of the
Théâtre des Variétés, whose fortune he had made, and
begged for a small weekly pittance. It was refused.
The old man smiled bitterly when the sentence was
pronounced, and from that time he shunned meeting
his acquaintance. The bookseller, Barba, who felt
some friendship for him, sought him in various parts of
the city, but in vain. A short time afterwards Barba
happened to hear that in a mean lodging, in the Rue
Grenétat, was lying, unclaimed and unknown, the corpse
of an old man. With a sad presentiment he hastened
thither. It was indeed Dorvigny-dead from cold and
hunger, uncared for alike in life and death!
The son of a peasant, the awkward servant-boy,
became a general, and after a glorious career died the
death of a hero: the son of a king, the charming poet,
the bewitching dramatist, lived in poverty, and died
the death of an outcast! Such is life! *
SHAKSPEARE AND THE MOUNTEBANK.
When I was a boy I went once to a theatre. The
tragedy of Hamlet was performed-a play full of the
noblest thoughts, the subtlest morality that exists upon
the stage. The audience listened with attention, with
admiration, with applause. But now an Italian mounte-
bank appeared upon the stage-a man of extraordinary
personal strength and sleight of hand. He performed a
variety of juggling tricks, and distorted his body into a
thousand surprising and unnatural postures. The
audience were transported beyond themselves; if they had
felt delight in Hamlet, they glowed with rapture at the
mountebank. They had listened with attention to the

That I have lov'd long since, and lost awhile.'
I WILL not paint them. God them sees, and I:
None other can, nor need. They have no forin;
I cannot close with passionate kisses warm
Their eyes that shine from far or from on high,
But never will shine nearer till I die.
How long, how long! See, I am growing old,
Have ceas'd to count within my hair's close fold
The silver threads that there in ambush lie;
Some angel faces, bent from heaven, would pine
What matter! In the furrows plough'd by care,
To trace the scarred lines written upon mine.
Let age tread after, sowing immortal seeds!
All this world's harvest yields, wheat, tares, and weeds,
Is reap'd; 'neath God's stern sky my field lies bare.
But in the night-time, 'tween me and the stars
The angel faces still come floating by,
No death-pale shadow, no averted eye
Marking the inevitable doom that bars
Me from them. Not a cloud their aspect mars;
And my sick spirit walks with them hand in hand
By the cool waters of a pleasant land;
Sings with them o'er again, without its jars,
The psalm of life that ceas'd when one by one
Their voices sank, and left my voice alone,
With dull monotonous wail, to grieve the air;
Turns glad from each to the other, still to find

Moon glimmerings, bridging the black sea, Despair!
Ay, angel faces! So I ever deemed
Their human likeness; so I see them now!
God laid his visible signet on each brow,
And they were holy, even as they seem'd.
Then, though all earth and hell itself had schem'd
To lure them from me by divided road,
One goal remains for all the throne of God;
And I shall find them there! Not vain I dream'd,
My sainted ones! my glorious ones! my lov'd
A little while, lest I might worship ye,
And lost ones! from my famish'd sight remov'd
And forget heaven. Sure as at God's White Throne
All whom He loves one living union own,
My angel faces there will shine on me.

LOVING ONE FOR ONE'S SELF.
THERE is a story of certain men of Gotham, who, sit-
ting down upon the ground in a circle to converse, had
some difficulty when they were about to separate in
finding their own peculiar limbs. Each man insisted
apon appropriating to himself the best-turned leg near
him, just as one naturally does in the matter of hats
at the breaking-up of an evening-party; and the em-
brouillement might have terminated in something serious
had not the disputants been members of the Peace
Society, and referred the question to the arbitration
of a passer-by. This individual fortunately possessed
at once a philosophic mind and a vigorous arm, and
he applied a horsewhip so sharply to the backs of the
whole circle that every man found his own legs in the
twinkling of an eye.
Some persons may be disposed to doubt, in a certain
measure, the authenticity of this anecdote, or even to
rank our men of Gotham summarily with the personages
of mythic story: but a little reflection will shew that
we are all subject to mistakes and misconceptions quite
as extraordinary, and of a much more wholesale nature.
What is more common than for a man to lose himself in
the mazes of a story, till his identity merges in that of
the hero, and he is the vision by which he is haunted, till
All his visage wans,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit'-
when suddenly the horsewhip of Circumstance flashes
over his shoulders-a door claps, a bell rings, a voice
calls-and hey presto! the illusion vanishes, and
Richard's himself again!
Himself? What self? This is a puzzling word when
you think of it. It is a tradition, a convention, sup-
posed by common consent to have a meaning; which,
nevertheless, waxes dimmer and more formless the more
earnestly you look for it. To be loved for one's self is
the grand aspiration both of romance and real life.
Love of any other kind is voted a lie and a cheat, and
not only so by sentimental young ladies but by the
grave, staid, and even elderly of the male sex. 'It is
I who must be loved,' say all with one voice, and not
my birth, fortune, station, power-not the mere mate-
rial circumstances by which I am surrounded by the
accidents of the world.' 'It is I who must be loved,'
says Miss Angelina, going into particulars, and not
my beauty, shape, manner, dress, dancing, dowry,
jewels: I must be loved for myself, and for myself
alone; for an individuality which cannot be affected by
misfortune, poverty, or even smallpox.'
PRICE 14d.
Now this is what puzzles us. What is this self?-
what is this individuality? It is a physiological fact that
the whole of our frame, the whole of our material part,
is perpetually changing; that there is not an atom of
our body which was in existence, as one of its com-
ponent parts, a few years ago; and that the materials
of which some brief time hence we shall be composed
are at present diffused throughout the different king-
doms of nature. It is obviously, therefore, not the
physical bulk of Miss Angelina she calls her Self; and
one does not see clearly how she can be said to have
any more absolute and exclusive property in her moral
and intellectual character apart from the circumstances
by which it was developed.
If our fair enthusiast had chanced to be born in a
cellar, and brought up in misery and crime, she would,
according to her theory, have still been the same self.
Will she tell us that she would still be entitled to
expect the same love? If not, she cannot be loved for
herself, but for the material circumstances which are
part and parcel of her individuality. If she had grown
up in some remote and solitary place, with a deaf-mute
for her sole companion, she would still have been the
same entity, and she would still have possessed, in the
recesses of her moral being, the germs of those qualities
which in a state of development and activity are fitted
to awaken admiration. But without knowledge, with-
out aspirations beyond those of mere animal life, and
without even language to express her few ideas, would
she be entitled to the love she now demands as a right?
It may be answered-for a man's self will not be
quietly surrendered any more than his skin--that at the
time love is won the moral and intellectual being is
formed, the innate qualities developed, and that indi-
viduality constituted which is the self all seck to
vindicate. But this is affixing an arbitrary and im-
possible limit to the progress of mind. It assumes that
circumstances influence us up to a certain precise point,
and that then their effect ceases suddenly, and the
character, till that moment in a liquid and ductile
state, cools down at once in its mould, and becomes a
solid and unchangeable mass. It is unreasonable thus
to have recourse to miracle even for the protection of
one's self. The world in which we live is the school of
circumstances, and we are usually taken home before
we are half taught. It is common to say of some
unexpected conduct in a man: We did not think him
capable of it: this presents him in quite a new light-
he is a different person from what we supposed him to
be.' He is indeed a different self. The circumstances
in which he chanced to be placed have brought out
some hitherto dormant points in his character, and the
man is to all intents and purposes a new being. These

circumstances are essential to the estimate we form of
him, whether good or bad, whether tending to love or
hate.
But the passion for being loved for one's self has led,
we are told, to experiment, and this has resulted in
facts that laugh at our philosophy. A gentleman who
has a high opinion of the entity he calls himself, deter-
mines to ascertain in what estimation it is held by
others. He takes measures, therefore, which appear to
strip him of all the prestiges of wealth and rank. He
becomes a bankrupt, loses his estate, lays down his
carriage, exchanges his mansion for a cottage; and in
this denuded condition presents himself to his lady-love.
Her woman's heart, however, is as firm as a rock. She
has loved him in wealth, and still loves him in poverty.
The atmosphere in which they lived has changed its tem-
perature; but she only nestles the closer to her chosen
one. The material conductors between them are broken;
but passion, with a finer sense than the electric fluid,
overleaps the chasm. Surely this is being loved for
one's self! Not at all. The gentleman only acts ruin,
he does not feel it; his manner, his speech, his aspect,
are the same, only touched by a melancholy which
gives romance to his misfortune. The lady only hears
of poverty, she does not see it; and her imagination is
busy embrowning her lover's cheek with manly toil,
and festooning their cottage - porch with roses and
jasmine.
Real poverty is a very different thing from stage
poverty. Real labourers neither work nor play in
knee-breeches trimmed with ribbons, and clean white
stockings; cottage girls don't go a haymaking in
muslin dresses, or dust the table with snowy aprons;
real gentlemen don't take kindly to their porridge or
their fat bacon; neither are they partial to the crystal
spring; and no more do they learn intuitively to
plough and reap, but on the contrary are jeered for
their ignorance and effeminacy by the cow-boys, and

man would cut a very awkward, and perhaps a very
unamiable figure in any other position than the one
he had been accustomed to-as his faithful mistress
would find if she could follow him into his new avoca-
tions. In the meantime she makes the mistake, in
meditating on his changed fortune, of supposing him to
be the same self by whom her heart was won; and
thus her fancy carries him in a stage costume through
the stern realities of the working world.
change his new fortune has wrought in him, and the
terror with which he starts at every apparition before
his fancy of his peasant mistress-she would know
that the hero of her love was no more than a shadow
or a memory.
But, again, do we say that there is no such thing as

that there is no such thing as love fixed upon a mere
abstraction-upon a thing irrespective of circumstance
and change. The grief that is felt at a love-disappoint-
ment is like the tears that are given to the dead-tears
that embalm the living image in our memory-not the
ruin that moulders in the grave. Disinterested love is
found in every station, in every circle of circumstances;
and in married life, more especially, where it has freer
scope, it enlivens the dreariest path of adversity, and

occult self we have been groping after, but of an actual
being possessed of qualities that have our sympathy
and admiration, and surrounded by circumstances cal-
culated to retain them in activity. For this being we
would make any sacrifice-in great emergencies, that
of life itself: but we will not stultify ourselves by
affirming that we love him as an abstraction. In the
above instances we have seen that generous love
remains even after its object has been stripped of
everything by which it was won. But this, philosophi-
cally considered, is the love of one who exists merely
in our memory, and with whom the actual man iden-
tifies himself only in those comparatively rare cases
where great, or good, or merely pleasing qualities are
so firmly embedded in the character as to survive the
shock of change.
TALES OF THE COAST-GUARD.
ALLY SOMERS.
WHEN I joined the Scorpion sloop of war, then (1810)
on the West India station, there were a father and son
amongst the crew whose names, as borne on the ship's
books, were John Somers and John Alice Somers. The
oddity in this country of giving a boy a female bap-
tismal name had been no doubt jestingly remarked
upon by those who were aware of it, but with the
sailors the lad passed as Ally Somers. The father was
approaching fifty, the son could not have been more

about six weeks afterwards, and it was eagerly em- eleven in the forenoon along the front of the Southamp-

sentenced to receive two dozen lashes for drunkenness in a seaman's dress, busily engaged with three others

length and girth of the bundles. This had been done,
and the laths marked as passed.' It struck me that
the manner of Ally Somers was greatly flurried and
excited, and when he saw me approaching, evidently
with an intention to accost him, this agitation percep-
tibly increased. He turned deadly pale, and absolutely
trembled with ill-concealed apprehension.
He was
somewhat reassured by my frank salutation; and after
a few commonplace inquiries I walked away, evidently
to his great relief, and he with his sailors continued
their eager work of loading the cart. I could not help
suspecting that something was wrong, though I could
not make up my mind to verify the surmise his per-
turbed and hurried manner excited. Once in a skirmish
on shore his father, the boatswain, had saved my life
by sending a timely bullet through the head of a huge
negro who held me for the moment at his mercy.
Besides I might be wrong after all, and I had no right
to presume that the officer who had passed the laths
had not made a sufficient examination of them. The
flurry of the young man might arise from physical
weakness and the severe labour he was performing in
such hot weather. These reasons, or more truly these
excuses for doing nothing, were passing through my
brain, when I observed the hasty approach of the
collector of customs himself towards the cart, followed
by several of his subordinates. Young Somers saw him
as quickly as I did, and the young man's first impulse,
it was quite plain, was flight. A thought no doubt of
the hopelessness of such an attempt arrested his steps,
and he stood quaking with terror by the side of the
cart, his right hand grasping for support at one of the
wheel-spokes.
Other instances of the intensity of affection glowing
within the stern man's breast for his comparatively
weak and delicate boy manifested themselves. Once
in action, when the lad, during a tumultuous and mur-
derous struggle, in beating off a determined attempt
to carry the sloop by boarding, chanced to stumble on
the slippery deck, he was overtaken before he could
recover himself, and involved in the fierce assault
which at the forecastle was momently successful. I was
myself hotly engaged in another part of the fight; but
attention being suddenly called to the forepart of the
ship by the enemy's triumphant shouts, I glanced
round just in time to see the boatswain leap, with the
yell and bound of a tiger, into the mêlée, and strike
right and left with such tremendous ferocity and power
as instantly to check the advancing rush. Our men
promptly rallied, and the deck was in a few minutes
cleared of every living foe that had recently profaned
it. Ally Somers, who had received a rather severe flesh
wound, and fainted from loss of blood, was instantly
caught up by his father, and carried with headlong
impatience below. When the surgeon, after a brief look
at the hurt, said: There is no harm done, Somers,'
the high-strung nerves of the boatswain gave way, and
he fell back upon a locker temporarily prostrate and
insensible from sudden revulsion of feeling. Several
times I was an unintentional auditor of scraps of con-
versation between the two whilst the lad was on the
sick-list, from which I gathered that Ally was the sole
issue of a marriage which had left bitter memories in
the mind of the father; but whether arising from the
early death of his wife, or other causes, I did not ascer-
tain. Somers was, it appeared, a native of the west of
England, and it was quite evident had received a much
better education than usually falls to individuals of his
class.
At the close of the war Somers and his son were,
with thousands of others, turned adrift from the royal
service. Some months after my appointment to the
command of the revenue-cutter, I chanced to meet the
father in the village of Talton, about four miles out of
Southampton, on the New Forest Road. He had I found
re-entered the navy, but chancing to receive a hurt by
the falling of a heavy block on his right knee, had
been invalided with a small pension, upon which he
was now living at about a hundred yards from the spot
where we had accidentally met. Ally, he informed
me, was the skipper of a small craft trading between
Guernsey and Southampton. There was little change
in the appearance of the man except that the crippled
condition of his leg appeared to have had an effect the
reverse of softening upon his stern and rugged aspect
and temper. When paid off he was, I knew, entitled to
a considerable sum in prize-money, the greater part of
which he told me he had recently received.
About a couple of months after this meeting with the
father I fell in with the son. I was strolling at about
'One of you lend me a knife,' said the collector,
addressing the officers of customs.
A knife was quickly opened and handed to him: he
severed the strong cords which bound one of the
bundles of laths together, and they flew asunder, dis-
closing a long tin tube of considerable diameter, closely
rammed with tobacco! All the other bundles con-
tained a similar deposit; and so large was the quan-
tity of the heavily-taxed weed thus unexpectedly
made lawful prize of, that a profit, I was assured, of
not less than L.500 or L.600 would have been made
by the audacious smuggler had he succeeded in his
bold and ingenious attempt. The ends of the bundles
had been filled up with short pieces of lath, so that,
except by the process now adopted, it was impossible
to detect that the cargo was not bonâ fide what it had
been declared to be. The penalties to which Somers
had rendered himself liable were immense, the vessel
also was forfeited, and the unfortunate young man's

then turning round, intimated by a supplicatory ges-
ture that he wished to speak to me. I drew near, and
at my request the officers fell back out of hearing.
He was so utterly prostrated by the calamity by which
he had been so suddenly overtaken, that he could not for
several moments speak intelligibly. I felt a good deal
concerned for so mere a boy, and one too so entirely
unfitted by temperament and nerve to carry through
such desperate enterprises, or bear up against their
failure.

'I will tell you,' he went on hurriedly to say in the
same feeble and trembling tone: 'I am not fitted for
a sea-life-not strong, not hardy enough. I longed for
a quiet, peaceful home ashore. A hope of one offered
itself. I made the acquaintance of Richard Sylvester,
a miller near Ealing. He is a good man, but griping
as far as money is concerned. I formed an attachment
for his eldest daughter Maria; and he consented to our
union, and to taking me as a partner in his business,

eager to wait long; besides I thought that perhaps

lips, and the meck-hearted young man burst into tears,
and wept piteously like a girl. A number of persons
were collecting round us, and I gently urged him to

true conclusion.

vengeful outcry which startled one like an explosion.
But,' added the strong and fierce-willed man after
a few moments' silence, it's useless prating of the
matter like a wench. We must part company at once.
I thank you, sir, and will tell Ally you have called.'
I mentioned the other request made by his son. That
is a rotten plank to hold by,' he said. Ally's chance
is over there, and it would be mere waste of time to
call on the old man: his resolution is hard and unyield-
ing as his own millstones. Maria Sylvester is gone
with the five hundred pounds her father bargained for;
and the girl's tears, if she shed any, will soon be dry.
I warned Ally of the peril of steering his course in life
by the deceptive light of woman's capricious smiles and
vanities; but he, poor, flexile, gentle-minded boy,
heeded me not. I may not longer delay: he will be
anxious to see me. Good-day, sir.'
The consequence which I chiefly feared came to pass,
even more speedily than I had apprehended. It being
impossible, for liquidate the penalties incurred, Ally
Somers was imprisoned as a crown debtor; and at that
period, whatever may be the case now, revenue penalties
could not be got rid of by insolvent-court schedules.
The prospect of an indefinite term of imprisonment,
with other causes of grief and depression, broke down
the always fragile health of the prisoner, and he died,

months' confinement only. T

cradle I have spoken of, to which a line was fastened
in order to steady his ascent from below. The order
was given to turn away, and the renewed click, click,
announced that he was ascending the face of the cliff.
I could hardly comprehend this manoeuvre, which
seemed to indicate the escape of the man we were the
most anxious to secure, and the order to shove off was
just on my lips when a powerful blue-light flamed
suddenly forth, accompanied by a fierce but indistinct
shout, or roar rather, from Somers. The men replied
by a loud cheer, and we shot smartly out; but having,
to avoid a line of reef, to row in a straight direction
for about a cable's length, the smugglers, panic-
stricken and bewildered as they were, had time to get
away upon their lugger, and were plying their sweeps
with desperate energy before the revenue-boat was
fairly turned in direct pursuit. The frantic effort to
escape was vain, and so was the still more frantic effort
at resistance offered when we ran alongside. We did
not hurt them much: one or two were knocked down
by the sailors' brass-butted pistols; and after being
secured, they had leisure to vent their rage in polyglot
curses, part French, part English, and part Guernsey
patois, and I to look round and see what had become of

inefficiently watched by the shore-force. Near the spot
selected is or was a kind of cavern worn by the action
of the sea in the chalky stratum, which at neap-tides
was partially dry, and at the time of our enterprise
would effectually conceal a boat from the observation
of any one who did not actually peer in directly at its
mouth Cocquierol was to leave Guernsey the next
day in anlarge boat, with two lug-sails, but chiefly
zdepending for speed upon its sweeps. It was calcu-
lated that he would reach his destination about
midnights Somers had undertaken the duty of shore-
signalman and if danger were apprehended, was to
warns the smugglers that hawks were abroad by
burning-asblue-light.The manner of running the
cargouwas to be this: Somers was provided with
windlass and sufficient length of rope, with a kind of
ropie cradle at the end of it, in which a man could sit,
or a couple of kegs be slung, to reach the boat. The
Windlass lie was to secure firmly at the edge of the
Déliff, and two or three of the men having been drawn
up, other windlasses were to be fixed, by means of
which it was calculated that in about half an hour the
lentire cargo would be safely carried off by the carts
which Somers had undertaken to have ready on the
spot. The signal for our appearance on the scene of
action, the positive old man persisted, should be that
agreed upon for Ithe warning of the smugglers the
sudden ignition of a blue-light. This did not seem the
icleverest possible mode of procedure; but as the cavern
in which we were to conceal ourselves was but a few
vyards northward of the spot marked out for the landing,
and Somers promised he would only give the signal
when the smugglers were in full work, I had little fear
that, if other accidents did not capsize our scheme, they
would be able to escape us.Tot no7 del

The blue-light still shed a livid radiance all around,
and to my inexpressible horror and dismay, I saw that
the unfortunate man was suspended in the rope cradle,
within about a fathom's length of the brow of the cliff,
upon which Somers was standing and gazing at his
victim with looks of demoniac rage and triumph. The
deadly trap contrived by the inexorable old man was
instantly apparent, and to Cocquerel's frenzied screams
for help. I replied by shouting to him to cut himself
loose at once, as his only chance, for the barrel of a
pistol gleamed distinctly in the hands of Somers.
Lieutenant Warneford, cried the exulting maniac

cradle he was ever rocked in in his life-Ha! ha! ha!'
'Cut loose at once!' I again shouted; and the men,
as terribly impressed as myself with the horror of the
wretched smuggler's position, swept the boat rapidly
towards the spot. Somers, if you shoot that man you
shall die on the gallows.'

As soon as the noise and bustle of laying in the
sweeps, lowering the sails, and unstepping the masts,
had subsided, we heard Somers hail the boat, and insist
that the captain should come up before any of the
others, as there was a difficulty about the carts which
he alone could settle. The reply was a growl of assent,
and we could hear by the click of the check to the cog-
wheel of the windlass that Somers was paying out the
rope. Presently Cocquerel was heard to get into the

down the white face of the cliff, and disappeared
beneath the waters!

in the following paragraph which I read some years
afterwards in the Hampshire Telegraph,' a journal at
that time published at Portsmouth :---

fated, and, as we believe, entirely innocent person.
At the inquest holden on Friday, it was ascertained
beyond a doubt that the deceased is John Maynard,

of Somers, and was, we believe, the person who shot

There are several mistakes sufficiently obvious to
the reader in this paragraph, but of the main fact that
John Somers, alias Maynard, perished as described in
the Devonshire journal, there can be no reasonable
doubt.
VISIT TO THE ABERDEEN COMBWORKS.
SINCE the days when King David I., of saintly memory,
erected into a bishop's see the haill village of old Aber-
don'-since the time when salmon-fish and granite-stone
first became articles of its local export in the thirteenth
century, Aberdeen has continued to maintain a character
of singular enterprise and originality. Notwithstand-
ing its many natural disadvantages and remote situa-
tion from the great produce-markets of the country,
it has, nevertheless, with the quiet though determined
perseverance which characterises its inhabitants, gra-
dually assumed an important position as a seat of our
Scottish manufacture, and bids fair at no distant date
to be as much celebrated for its superiority in this
respect as it has been in past ages as a school of philo-
sophy and learning. On more than one occasion we
have adverted to the progress of Aberdeen, and not
only with regard to its material prosperity, but also to
the liberal and enlightened spirit with which those
perplexing social questions are treated that conspire so
much to disturb the peaceable and harmonious progress
of society. To this place we are indebted for the first
successful example of that class of humble yet service-
able educational institutions that have since become
so widely known as Ragged Schools; and even in the
apparently unimportant subject before us, it can easily
be perceived that something like the same characteristic
energy is exhibited.
Within our recollection, combmaking was considered
one of the most miserable of trades, and equally desti-
tute of anything like an organised modus operandi with
that of the perambulating artisans who possessed a
certain skill in the fashioning of rams' horns into
spoons and rejoiced in the ancient and expressive
designation of Horners. On a late visit to Aberdeen,
however, we found the manufacture of combs carried
on there not only to an extent far exceeding our pre-
conceived notions of the trade, but flourishing in a
state of high and skilful organisation; and we hastened
to visit the combworks of Messrs Stewart, Rowell,
& Co., who possess the reputation of being by far the
largest combmakers in this country or in the world.
There is another manufactory in Aberdeen, that of Mr
John Macpherson, on a much smaller though still
considerable scale. We have no room to follow the
steps by which Aberdeen came to be the seat of this
particular branch of industry; but before describing
the system of combmaking there, we shall take a
short retrospective glance at the general history of
the comb, in order to illustrate the various changes
it has passed through, and its gradual elevation to
a respectable position in the manufactures of the
country.
It is impossible to state with any degree of accuracy
the time when this implement first became an indis-
pensable requisite of the toilet; but from what we
The Greeks and
can glean from the ancient writers it would appear
to have been of Egyptian origin.
Romans used combs made of boxwood, which they
obtained, as we do ourselves, from the shores of the
Euxine Sea; and the mountain-ridge of Cytorus, in
Galatia, was particularly celebrated for this product.
According to a modern Italian author (Guasco), combs
were also formed of silver, iron, bronze, but in no
instance do we find the modern material of shell or horn.
In addition to the wooden combs found in their tombs,
it has been proved that the Egyptians had ivory combs,
toothed on one side, which gradually came into use
among the Greeks and Romans; but from specimens of
the remains of combs found at Pompeii, together with
representations on the Amyclæan tables, it would seem
that the Greeks, who were remarkably studious and
careful in arranging their hair, used them, with teeth
on both sides, exactly similar to our small-tooth-
combs.
The medieval progress of the comb exhibits, like
everything else of its class, much curious elaboration
with but little improvement in utility. In the fifteenth
volume of the Archæologia' there is a representation
of an ivory comb found in the ruins of Inkleton Nun-
nery, Cambridgeshire, containing some Anglo-Saxon
design exquisitely carved in relief, but with such teeth
as a common boor in our day would treat with con-
tempt. About this period we find Chaucer commenting
on the many absurd articles of female attire, at a time
when both sexes tied up their hair in a 'licorous fashion'
with ivory pins; and, curious enough, one of the earliest
specimens of English combs extant was dug up in 1764
from beneath the lowest of the three paved streets,
which lie-memorials of their several ages-under the
present Shiprow Street of Aberdeen; and it was sup-
posed to have lain there ever since Edward III. burned
and ruined the city in 1336.
In modern days the comb probably reached its most
costly and ornamental state at the luxurious court of
Louis XIV., where hair-dressing was an art more
appreciated and often better paid than the higher
efforts of genius. Combs of ivory and of tortoise-shell,
richly inlaid with gold and pearl, formed an essential
adjunct of the toilet of the court beauties of Versailles.
In this country the fabrication of horn into combs was
a very ancient process, and chiefly resided, as it still
does, in England, in Yorkshire and the midland coun-
ties. But towards the end of last century the increased
demand for combs established makers all over the
country; and in Scotland there were one or two houses
of some eminence in the trade at the period-some
twenty-five years back-at which we have now arrived.
It was, however, one of those trades that, in so far as
its artificers were concerned, would not stand investi-
gation. Making combs on nearly the same principles
as those pursued by their forefathers for generations
before them-that is to say, by simply cutting out
the interspace between the teeth with various sorts
and sizes of saws-its followers, barely entitled to the
name of skilled workmen, were dissipated, unsettled,
and irregular in their habits.
We come now to treat of the grand era in the comb
trade-of the time when it was destined, like the great
staple manufactures of our country, to undergo a revo-
lution. The introduction into the trade of machinery
and steam-power, with, as a collateral result, the divi-
sion of labour, is at once suggestive of an important
stride in the march of progress. About the year 1828
Mr Lynn invented a machine of a singularly ingenious
design and construction, having for its principal object
that of cutting two combs out of one plate of horn
or tortoise-shell; and two years afterwards Messrs
Stewart, Rowell, & Co. commenced the manufacture

71
in Aberdeen. To the first of these circumstances the
trade was indebted for the successful idea of a machine,
which effected at the same time a saving of half the
material, and an increase of produce almost incon-
ceivable. To the latter it is still more indebted for the
first application of steam-power to the machinery; and,
what we think of infinitely greater importance, the
introduction of those true principles in the philosophy
of production so logically contended for by Adam Smith
--a philosophy which, in its legitimate application, has
the invariable effect of elevating alike the character of
the produce and the producers.
We shall, however, most appropriately represent the
combined effect of these improvements on the trade by
taking the reader along with us in a cursory view of
the principal departments of the Aberdeen Comb-
works. Provided with an intelligent cicerone in the
person of one of the clerks of the office, we began
our investigations; and as an essential preliminary,
were first shewn specimens of the various kinds of raw
material. In the order of its intrinsic value this con-
sists of tortoise-shell, horns, and hoofs. Ivory in our
day is reserved almost exclusively for the manufacture
of small-tooth-combs, which forms a branch of the
ivory trade, and is entirely distinct from the one now
before us.
Of the first of these materials, tortoise-shell, the best
adapted to manufacturing purposes is the shell, or
rather scales of a horny contexture which enclose the
sea-tortoise, Testudo imbricata. It is to be found in
all warm latitudes; but the best species are indigenous
to Hindostan, the Indian Archipelago, and the shores
of the Red Sea. The price of this article we are apt to
think excessive. At present it is 35s. per lb., and ten
years ago it was nearly double that price. It forms,
however, a valuable article of importation.
There are two chief divisions in the second article,
horn; namely, buffalo and ox horns, both of which are
imported from various parts of the globe. Buffalo-
horn is, however, for the most part used in the manu-
facture of knife-handles, and such-like articles in the
cutlery trade. In combmaking it is chiefly used for
dressing-combs; and, generally speaking, all combs of
a deep black colour are formed of this material. The
best buffalo-horns are obtained from the East Indies,
and incomparably the finest are those of the Indian
buffalo from Siam. We were shewn a beautiful specimen
of Siamese horns, which, from their extraordinary
dimensions, had been preserved and polished. One of
them measured 5 feet from tip to base, 18 inches in
circumference at the widest part, and weighed 14 lbs.
Some conception may be formed of the extraordinary
size of an animal which can support such a weight on
the frontal-bone, if we recollect that a good specimen
of an English ox-horn weighs only 1 lb.
Ox-horns, again, constitute the staple of comb-
making, and are imported into this country along with
hides from the South American states, the Cape of
Good Hope, and New South Wales. The imports,
however, are chiefly sustained from the enormous herds
of South American black-cattle, which have multi-
plied to such an extent in the Brazilian territories
that they are now slaughtered for the sake of their
hides and horns, and their carcasses left to be devoured
by the innumerable carnivorous animals which infest
the jungles. The ox-horns entered for consumption
in Great Britain in 1850 numbered 1,250,000; and the
average price is about L.50 per ton.
The material of hoofs depends for its supply on the
German and home markets; and its value at this
moment is about L.12 per ton. Hoofs are used gene-
rally in the manufacture of the cheapest description of
combs; but although the least valuable material, it is
the subject of the most costly and ingenious mechanical
appliances in the process of its manufacture.
At the time of our visit the quantity of horns and
hoofs in stock amounted to upwards of one hundred
tons of each. This immense mass of horns was con-
tained in a large storehouse for the purpose, a glance
into which has a curious effect on the visitor; and in
truth we could not repress a thought somewhat akin
to what we might have entertained on seeing the like
quantity of human skulls. Enormous piles of different
varieties of horns-from the delicate curvature of the
small Highland ox to the equally beautiful but enor-
mous cornu of the ferocious buffalo of the Cape; from
the Smithfield horns, immortal in story, to those of
the gigantic buffalo of Thibet and Siam-all lay pros-
trate here, piled together in inextricable confusion.
After taking a look at the steam-engine, which is of
fifty horse-power, and we were informed the largest
of the horizontal kind in Scotland, we proceeded to
the first stage of the manufacture, where the horns
are cut into assorted sizes by means of a circular
saw. A horn is twice cut transversely, and afterwards,
if a large one, longitudinally. The tips or extremities
of the horn here cut off are sent to Sheffield, where
they are converted into table-knife and umbrella
handles; and in this operation 16,000 horns can be
cut up in a week. Instead of being divided in this
manner, the hoofs in their first stage are, after being
boiled for a certain time, to render the fibre soft, cut
into two pieces; or rather the sole is stamped out by
means of vertical punching-machines of the same
irregular conformation.
The horns and hoofs thus cut are then brought in
pieces into the pressing department, which occupies
the whole basement-floor of one part of the building.
The first thing that strikes the visitor on entering
here is the peculiar and easily-distinguishable odour of
burnt horn, which indeed is also predominant through-
out the works. This arises from the high temperature
necessary to the fabrication of horn, which to a greater
or less extent effects decomposition of the material, and
is invariably accompanied with the disengagement of
the peculiar gases which create the odour. Along the
floor of this department are erected thirty-six furnaces
of a peculiar construction, and at each of these a man
and boy were busily engaged in shaping the cut horns
into flat plates, by first heating the pieces and then
cutting them to the required shape with a knife: they
were then inserted between screw-blocks, and pressed
perfectly flat. If, however, the plates are required for
stained combs, as the greater part of them generally
are, a different mode of pressing is pursued. Into a
rectangular cast-iron trough about 24 feet long by 12
inches wide and deep, a number of iron hot-plates are
put; they are then oiled on their surface, and the
plates of horn inserted between them; a wedge is next
driven into the press by the percussion-force of a ram,
or weight falling from a height of eight feet, producing a
force of about 120 tons. This pressure exercised on the
horn contained within the iron plates has the effect of
breaking the fibre to a certain extent, and forcing it
to expand in a lateral direction. Curious enough, what-
ever may have been the original colour of the horn, it
is now of a uniform dark-green colour, and perfectly
soft. This peculiar treatment renders the horny tissues
more pervious to the chemical action of acids, and will
be better understood when we arrive at the subsequent
operation of staining.
But the ram and wedge is not the only means of pres-
sure employed. Around the apartment were arranged
120 iron screw-presses-levers of the second order, and
differing only from a common vice in pressing under
the screw after the manner of nut-crackers. They are
fitted with steel dies with a variety of engraved designs,
and into these braid-combs, the outside coverings of
pocket-combs and side-combs are pressed. In accord-
ance with the spirit of the times, we were shewn a new
impression on pocket-combs of a very nicely-executed
representation of the Crystal Palace. A man exert-

T
ing his strength on one of those presses can produce a
force of upwards of fifty tons, But however great, the
pressure is still insufficient. The enormous, demand
for the cheap side-combs formed of hoof led to the
farther application of hydraulic pressure, The two
portions of the hoof produced in the first stage are
brought into this department, and after being boiled
a second time in a number of little troughs, with, a
steam-jet in each of them to preserve the necessary
temperature, the fleshy matter and other excrescences
still adhering are pared off. They are then trans-
ferred to an adjoining room, where sixteen hydraulic
presses are at work, by means of a small oscillating
engine of three or four horse-power for their exclu,
sive use; and here those little strips of hoof are sub
jected to a pressure of 300 tons, and with a degree of
speed and precision that is truly astonishing. They
come out of the press in the form of small semi-trans-
parent rectangular plates, having on each side the
rounded projection or beading observable on most sides
combs. We e may remark here that this application of
hydraulic pressure seems to us to be highly ingenious.,
In pressing a bale of cotton goods, for example, it is
to a certain extent immaterial whether the pressure
exceed that required by a few tons; but with the
fibrous tissue of a plate of horn, the case is widely
different; pressure it will sustain to a certain point,
but should this be exceeded by a single ton or a single
pound, the fibre is split and broken, and the mate-
rial destroyed. To
the resistless force of
this pressure, we were
that the Very cast
steel dies which give shape to the hoof soon become
crushed and worn out; and it was not without some
nice calculation and experiment that the application
of hydraulic pressure to the purpose was thus success-
fully attained. After having received the necessary
formation by the various modes of pressing, the plates
are laid aside to dry in a room where a high tempe-
rature is preserved by means of steam-pipes, and
where they are also assorted into different sizes, and

however, and all small-tooth-combs, are still cut by

next cutting department. Here, however, a moderately
curious visitor will not linger. A dense atmosphere of
horn-dust pervades the large apartment, which gives
to everything within its influence the white dusty
appearance that distinguishes a flour mill, to which
indeed at first sight it bears a striking resemblance.
From the few hurried notes we took, however, we learn
that here, there are wheels on the fine self-acting

the operatives of this animalised atmosphere, and were
informed that it was not known to be injurious. On
the contrary, it was stated as a singular fact, in con-
nection, with the late visitation of cholera in Aberdeen,
that not a single combmaker had been affected by the
disease, at least fatally; whence, it may be inferred,
although we do not pretend to assign the reason, that
the fabrication of horn must be attended with consi-T

certain that horn-dust cannot exercise that injurious

whether in the form of plates, as in the side-bombs, or
after being twinned, as in dressing-combs, is first
immersed in diluted nitric acid, which, with its charac
teristic action on all organised tissues, creates a deep
and permanent yellow stain! This resembles the
ground colour of tortoiseshell;and to produce the
peculiar variegation; the diorns are then treated with
a particular composition of the red oxide of lead with
certain alkaline compounds, which has the effect of
first neutralising the action of the acid, and then of
imprinting a stain of a deep orange colour. After
being carefully washed, dried, and polished the sur
face of the combs presents the beautiful and natural
appearances of tortoise shell. Indeed the imitation is
so perfecto in the bost classes of stained combs, that
a, practised observer only can detect it. We were

staining, which, on the whole is a somewhat artistic
operation, is exclusively performed by women and girls.
There are still some minor departments, which we
need not describe in detail. Buffing consists in
smoothing the rough surfaces of the horn by means of
wheels covered with walrus siin: Side-Combs and
braids are bent to their peculiar curve by being first
heated and then fastened to wooden blocks an opera
tion that lasts only few minutes. Pocket-combs
have of course a different and peculiar treatment în
some stages; such as the formation of the joint, and
the putting together of the handles. And there is a
department in the works exclusively devoted to the
fabrication of horn spoons, which becomes chiefly
remarkable from the circumstance of there being no
modera application of machinery to t manufacture.

subjected, is that of polishing,' which is also effected

There are so many beautiful instances of the division
of labour here exhibited, that the task of selecting
is not easy. But let us take for an example the
cheapest article in the trade; namely, the side-combs,
sold retail at 1d. per pairan article that, in its
progress from the hoof to the comb-finished, carded,
and labelled German shell'undergoes eleven distinct
operations. This comb, then, which twenty years ago
was sold to the trade at 3s. 6d. per dozen, can now be
purchased in the same way for two shillings and sixpence
per gross! thus effecting a reduction in price of about
1600 per cent.india.co

Regarded in this aspect, in the relation of labour to
material, we find that hoofs-intrinsically the least
valuable of the three materials—become, with the
application of labour, the most valuable—that is, pro-
portionably and the converse holds good in the case
of tortoise-shell. The Important relation labour bears
to the produce may be estimated from the fact, that
this establishment pays a larger sum of weekly
than is now paid for the important businese bly wages
spinning in Aberdeen.
Thus much, then, for the produce; and with a cursory
glance at the producers we conclude.

MICROSCOPIC RESULTS."
LITTLE should we know of the wonders of the great
deep if we merely took note of the forms of life which
are visible to the unassisted eye. Almost every tuft of
coralline or weed is the seat of a numerous population,
of which only the microscope can give us tidings. We
cannot estimate the treasures we have gathered until,
when the day's work on the water is over, we sit down
to the instrument, and find that the spots we had
deemed waste are teeming with life and beauty, and
that the smallest creature we had recognised is a
monster as compared with the pigmy tribes which
were swarming unseen around it. We place a portion
of one of the larger zoophytes which we have brought
home living in a watch-glass containing sen-water, and
submit it to the microscope. It is in itself a beautiful
object, and we watch with delight the milk-white
polypes issuing from their little cells and unfolding
themselves like delicate blossoms on the branch. But
we soon discover that the fragment before us is infested
by a parasitic population; that its surface is covered
with minute but wondrous forms of animal and veget-
able organisation. That which to the naked eye
appears as at most a roughness on the branch, is ren-
dered by the microscope into a multitude of beings,
each perfect of its kind, presenting us with the most
admirable structure, and often with an exquisite beauty.
Most of them belong to the great class of the animal-
cules creatures which are universally distributed,
which swarm by countless millions in the waters of the
earth, and make every lonely pool a scene of busy life
and happiness. Minute and insignificant as these
beings are, they have a most important mission to
fulfil. Their amazing numbers enable them to accom-
plish works which may truly be called gigantic. A
great comparative anatomist has happily styled them,
'Nature's invisible police.' They are commissioned to
arrest and bring back the fugitive particles of organised
matter when on the point of escaping into the inor-
ganic world. By feeding on the decaying animal and
vegetable substances, which are held in solution in the
water, they prevent them from passing off into a
gaseous state, and convert them into a wholesome
pabulum for other and higher tribes. They thus eco-
nomise for nature, and keep up the supplies of food.
They prevent waste-they gather up the fragments:
they are also sanitary agents-they form a mighty host
of scavengers, and clear the waters of the putrefying
matter which would otherwise pour volumes of noxious
vapour into our atmosphere.
There are many members of this useful class on the
piece of zoophyte now before us. We will examine
a few of them. The most numerous and the most
graceful are the bell-shaped animalcules (Vorticella) —
creatures so lovely that the description of them should
only be intrusted to the poet. We will attempt a
prosaic sketch, but without hoping to do justice to the
original. The vorticella consists of a transparent,
vase-like body, mounted on a slender, pellucid stem,
which is attached to some foreign substance, and can
be swayed to and fro at the pleasure of the animal.
At the upper extremity of the little vase is the mouth,
*See Journal, No. 379.
and around it is set a circlet of vibratile hairs (cilia),
which, by their rapid play, create currents in the
water, and whirl the nutritive particles towards the
opening. This beautiful ciliary fringe can be retracted
at will. Within the body we may distinguish a few
globular sacs, like coloured specks in a crystal vessel,
which, when the creature is feeding, are in a state
of restless motion, and may be seen to circulate at
times round the interior cavity. These are probably
locomotive cells which receive the food, and distribute
it through all portions of the tiny organism. Such is
the general structure of these simple beings. Let us
watch one of them for a moment. The slender stem
is extended to its full length, and swings to and fro
(there is a peculiar grace in all the movements) beneath
the pretty calyx. The cilia are in full play, and a
stream of atoms-the delicacies of the season'-is
hurrying into the mouth of the little gourmand. When
suddenly alarm is taken, and with the rapidity of
thought the cilia are withdrawn, the body contracts
into a ball, and the stem into a most beautiful spiral.
After the lapse of a second or two the spiral slowly
uncoils, the body rises majestically, and the eager pur-
suit is resumed. Beauty is the great characteristic of
these little creatures. It appears in their form, their
movements, and their structure. The vorticella are
amongst the commonest of microscopic beings. The
observer encounters them at all points, and often in
the most unlikely localities. Is he examining a drop of
ditch-water?-he finds them clustering about every
speck of scum which it contains. He detects a minute,
irregularly-shaped mass on the stem of a water-plant:
as he watches it, it begins to rise, and at last expands
into an arborescent vorticella-a miniature tree, the
branches of which are all laden with the ciliated bells.
A water-flea, or the larva of some insect, makes its
appearance beneath the lens, carrying a whole company
on its back. Our piece of zoophyte has a multitude
upon it, and the little things are darting up and down
even amongst the tentacles of the polypes themselves.
A still more curious and beautiful form of vorticella
is also present. Here are several little plumes of the
most symmetrical shape and the extremest delicacy.
They might be feathers dropped from the wing of some
microscopic bird. Each plume is a compound being.
The little branches bear multitudes of the vase-like
bodies which we have just described, and their thousands
of cilia keep the surrounding fluid in a state of constant
agitation. Each of the minute beings associated in
this plumous commonwealth enjoys a certain amount
of independence--selecting its own food, and employing
its cilia at pleasure; but all are subject to a central
power or will; for let any cause of alarm present itself,
the entire structure, as it were, crumples up, the
branches cluster together, and for a time all signs of
vitality disappear. Our readers must not forget that
the wonderful forms of life which we are now examining
are either altogether or all but invisible to the naked
eye. We find the spirit of beauty represented in these
minims as well as in the grander features of the uni-
verse. Wisely has it been said: "That which we fool-
ishly call vastness is, rightly considered, not more
wonderful, not more impressive, than that which we
insolently call littleness.'
Another microscopic form of life (Cothurnia) is abun-
dant on the marine productions which our dredge has
supplied. Imagine a perfectly hyaline case, bounded
by lines of beauty which the highest art might copy,
and set upon a short and rigid stalk or pedestal. Fixed
at the bottom of this 'crystal palace' is a small body,
in shape somewhat resembling an Etruscan vase.
rises slowly, stretching itself upward towards the
entrance of its little mansion. Having reached it, it
throws out a pretty circlet of cilia, which immediately
begin to vibrate, and draw towards the mouth the
nutritious particles which serve as food. When alarmed,

it suddenly retracts itself, and nestles snugly at the
bottom. The body when extended is elongate and
tapering, and is attached to the case. It is transparent,
and the little sacs, such as we have described in the
vorticella, are plainly visible within it. There is some-
thing singularly attractive in the graceful form and
crystal-like transparency of these little mounted urns,
and occurring, as they often do, in profusion on other
marine animals, they contribute largely to the micro-
scopic garniture of the ocean. It adds much to the
pleasure which their mere beauty affords us to consider
that each one of them gives shelter to a happy inmate,
whose structure, though so minute, is perfect of its
kind, whose little wants are all well supplied, and
which witnesses as impressively in behalf of Providence
as the most highly-organised and endowed of living
beings.
C
found completely overwrought with their network.'
Mr Landsborough mentions a specimen of one of the
tribe which measured five feet in length by eight inches
in breadth. As every little cell,' he says, 'had been
inhabited by a living polype, by counting the cells on
a square inch I calculated that this web of silvery lace
had been the work and the habitation of above two
millions of industrious, and, we doubt not, happy
inmates; so that this single colony on a submarine
island was about equal in number to the population of
Scotland.'
There are also other forms of bryozoa. In many
kinds the cells, instead of creeping, are aggregated into
plant-like tufts. Here is a little bush of ivory white-
ness, rooted to a stem, which we have torn from some
submarine forest. It has the general aspect of a plant,
but is in truth a compound animal. Its branches are
laden with tubular cells, and instead of flowers or fruit
it bears polypes. A multitude of these little beings,
each in its stony case, are here organically united to
form one structure, and from every portion of it they
display their ciliated arms, supplying at once their own
wants and helping to maintain the common life. These
plant-like bryozoa are also numerous, and their history
is as full of interest as their forms are full of beauty.
But we can dwell no longer upon them at present.
We turn for a moment to the microscopic vegetation
which in wonderful profusion and variety spreads over
almost every object that comes beneath the lens. We
read of the beauty of palm- groves, and of tropical
forests, draperied with pendant parasites, whose flowers,
cast into the most fantastic shapes, painted with gor-
glory of colouring which only the sunset or the rainbow
can rival. But hardly less beautiful, and certainly not
less wonderful, is this miniature forest, which, all but
invisible to the naked eye, clothes the stem of the sea-
plant, and gives food and shelter to many tribes. Often
have we paused in our search for animalcules through
the tangled mazes of these Lilliputian groves to admire
the strange and the exquisite forms of the vegetation,
and to marvel at the beauty and variety which have
been crowded into the obscurest nooks of creation.
But we must pass from the animalcules, taking no
note of the multitudes, minuter far than those we have
described, which swarm in each drop of water, and
select an example from another tribe. Creeping over
the stem which we are examining is a patch of delicate,
silvery lacework, as it appears. It consists of a number
of small calcareous cells, laid side by side, and forming
a gauze-like incrustation.' Each cell has an aperture,
which is guarded by several spines. It is a snug little
home, and has a tenant that we shall presently describe.
This structure is one of the moss-corals (Bryozoa)an
extensive tribe, which exhibits a comparatively high
organisation, and plays an important part amongst the
varied population of the great waters.' In the speci-
men under notice there may be some scores of cells;
but a single community often comprises many thousands.geous dyes, or tinted with ethereal delicacy, present a
Stretched over the opening of each cell is a membrane-
ous covering, towards one end of which there is a small
valve, which opens so as to allow the owner of the
dwelling-a polype of exquisite structure-to pass
forth. And now one is issuing! The little door is
thrown open, and a cylindrical body is protruded for
some way, the anterior portion of which (it is a flexible
sheath) is unrolled, as you would push out the inverted
finger of a glove. From the extremity of this sheath a
bundle of tentacles is darted out, which at length
expands into a beautiful campanulate figure; and each
of these tentacles or arms, which at first sight appear
no more than simple filaments, is found upon close
examination with the microscope to be thickly clothed
with vibratile hairs, which by their incessant strokes
drive currents of water towards the mouth, and so
provide for nutrition. The internal organisation of
these creatures, as well as the mechanism of their cells,
is wondrously complete and curious; and the story of
their reproduction is a little romance, which it were
pleasant to tell had we space at command. Their
movements are most vivacious. They dart from their
cells, and for awhile the delicate bell-shaped crowns of
tentacles are swaying gracefully over the silvery net-
work. But if the water be roughly agitated they vanish
on the instant; down they sink beneath the membrane-
ous roofs of their little dwellings, the door is close shut
behind them, and you can detect no sign of life through-
out the colony. There is an extraordinary variety in
the form and arrangements of the cells in the different
species. In some they form a simple network; in
others, they are like little barrels, often curiously
sculptured or prettily frosted and granulated; in
others, they run along the surface of stone or shell,
like a string of beads. The moss-corals occur in
immense profusion. On almost every marine produc-
tion they establish themselves, overlaying with their
white and glistening crusts the bare surface of stones
and the quiet hollows of deserted shells; investing the
stems of zoophyte and sea-plants, and, in short, planting
colonies in all conceivable localities, and turning many
a waste place into a seat of life, beauty, and happiness.
The broad fronds of the larger sea-weeds may often be
The microscopic plants to which we refer belong prin-
cipally to one family (Diatomaceœ.) It were impossible
in few words to give any idea of their manifold forms.
Here is a little tree, the prettily-variegated leaves of
which are arranged in fan-like clusters. Here we have
a number of parallelograms, attached one to the other
by a single corner, and forming delicate chains which
intertwine and hang in glittering masses from the
weed. Some of these little chains are richly and elabo-
rately carved. Here is a plant, which in shape is a
simple wedge; but the forms are endless, and strange
enough they, many of them, are without parallel in the
vegetable world. Nor is colour wanting in these tiny
forests. Vivid greens, sober browns, and delicate golden
tints, give diversity to the foliage. Again we must
remind the reader that the forest which we have so
imperfectly described is to the naked eye a mere scum
on the stalk of a sea-weed!
Much more might be said of these interesting plants.
They are amongst the most ancient of vegetable races.
The records which they have left of their existence in
distant geological ages are such as to fill us with wonder.
Endowed with a power of secreting flint, and depositing
it in their substance, they are in truth indestructible;
and of their remains, minute as they are, whole beds of
rock and tracts of country have been in great measure
compacted. What changes may they not at this mo-
ment be preparing in the condition of our globe?
We have thus glanced at a few of the minute forms
of life, animal and vegetable, which abound in the
ocean, and which the dredger has the amplest oppor-
tunity of examining if he will, and we must now return
to the bay and the boat. A fresh haul has just been

We have referred to the breathing apparatus of the
tunicata. It is interesting to note the various methods
by which the same function is provided for in different
classes. Here we have a sca-slug (Aplysia) allied in
general structure to the ravager of our gardens. In
this creature the respiratory organ consists of (an
elegant plume-shaped appendage placed at the top of
the body. The vessels are distributed over this, which,
from its position is always bathed by the surrounding
water and the blood flowing through them is freely
exposed to the influence of oxygen. Gliding about
amongst the branches of the weed, we meet with many
members of another family of molluscs (Nudibran-
chiata. These are graceful creatures, related to the
tenants of the univalve shells (that is, the whelk), but
themselves destitute of all external defence. Their
delicately and variously-coloured bodies are for the
most part covered with appendages, prettily branched,
and resembling miniature trees. These little trees, which
wave through t

breathing organs. In others of the tribe these arbo-
rescent tafts are aggregated at one point of the body,
and form a circle of exquisite beauty, and not inaptly
comparable to a flower in appearance and disposition.

colours, and the gracefulness of their movements, may

could unblushingly ask the produce of a duty on coals

These monopolies or patents were a main cause of the
discontents of James's reign, and of the actual conflict
in that of his son.
The Duke of Lenox, whose widow shewed herself so
able and active, was the son of that Esmé Stewart who
brought King James into so much disgrace as a disso-
lute favourite. His successor had but a brief enjoy-

Buckingham signs himself 'Stinie.' This is the Scot-
tish vernacular familiar for Stephen, and it appears that
it was a name given by the monarch to his favourite on
account of his resemblance to the apostle's representa-

this correspondence, not taking the trouble of copying
the spelling precisely, as we did that of the duchess.
The reader will doubtless notice the bold dealing with
important affairs of state, and the insolently-familiar
conclusion. The letter appears to have been written at
the time when parliament began to attack the duke,
on the return of Charles I. from his romantic expedi-
tion to Spain. Buckingham was the projector of the
expedition, and it was evidently through his pride and
insolence that it became abortive. Here is the letter,

The fate of this vain coxcomb, whose power became
almost unlimited throughout Britain, is well known:
he was stabbed at Portsmouth while preparing to set
out at the head of an expedition to raise the siege of
Rochelle. The assassin was an insane lieutenant named
Felton, who had served under him, and had been dis-
appointed in his hope of being raised to the rank of
captain. He dropped his hat while committing the
murder, with a paper in it, shewing the direction of
his insane malice. This paper was, by the way, in the
possession of an autograph collector with whom we
were acquainted, and formed the glory of his collec-
tion.
An assassination is always abhorrent to English
feeling; and little as the duke was liked, either by the
aristocracy or the middle classes, his death created a
profound sensation. The collection of manuscripts of
which we have been making use shews, however, that at
least one man had a perverted enough taste to attempt to
commemorate the event in exulting poetry. We wonder
how any one in that age dared to preserve such a pro-
duction. The self-esteem of authorship might tempt a
man to write it, but there is nothing in its merits to
induce a collector to brave any danger for its preserva-
tion. The commencement will be quite enough to
satisfy the reader of its quality.

THE FRENCH ON INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.
THE number for June last of that eminent periodical,
the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' presents us with an
interesting article from the pen of M. Audiganne, de-
voted to L'Enseignement Industriel, which the author uses
as a translation of our expression, 'industrial training.'
We have repeatedly had occasion to comment on this
important subject; but preparatory to some notice of
the French views, we shall state briefly what we under-
stand by industrial training as practised in this country.
When the system of Ragged Schools was established,
some gentlemen who had devoted their attention to
practical economics, while they admitted that much
good would be accomplished by them, questioned how
far the system could be safely carried. They feared
that there was a point at which we must stop in afford-
ing immediate homes to all children left destitute by
their parents, especially if the establishments in which
they were received merely gave them temporary occu-
pation, without raising their capabilities or fitting them
for self-support. In fact, carried to a certain extent, it
might hold out temptations to parents who otherwise
might provide for their offspring, to leave them to the
always inferior resource of public charity. It was felt,
however, that within the partial sphere which they
as yet occupy there was an element capable of being
introduced in these establishments which could not fail
greatly to improve their usefulness, and make them
effective for the permanent reformation of at least a
portion of society-this was the system of industrial
training. Now, to perceive the efficacy of this prin-
ciple, observe that from their very commencement
industry was associated with these institutions. The
poor wanderers who received food and instruction in
them were to be occupied in work: but in what work?

The allusions to Spain in connection with the Duke
of Buckingham and Prince Charles naturally lead us
to a volume of Sir James Balfour's Collection, which
may be found to throw light on some mysterious
intrigues of King James before he ascended the throne
of England. The documents appear to justify a pretty
prevalent suspicion, that he was endeavouring to secure
the assistance of the Roman Catholic courts to aid him
in ascending the English throne should it turn out that
Queen Elizabeth indicated another successor, or that in
any other way he might be likely to lose the support of
the Protestants. Lord Semple, who had lived for a
considerable time in Spain, appears to have been the
moving-spring of these intrigues. His letters are
extremely curious, and we would say from their spell-
ing that they shew the writer to have forgotten his
native language, and become imbued with Spanish.
We shall conclude this article with the commencement
of one of them, given exactly as it is spelt:-
'It vill ples zour Magestie yat eftir my arriual hir I

and therefore, though this might not be obvious to the
benevolent founders of the system, least valuable.
The pupils were to pick down old ropes into tow or
oakum ; to sort hair and wool; to make mats, and
nets, and the like. They were thus kept out of mis-
chief for the time being, but were not permanently
redeemed from pauperism. The occupations we have
mentioned are all pauper employments, next door to
utter idleness, and incompetent for self-support. They
tended, then, to place the managers of the Ragged Schools
in this dilemma-that after all their efforts they did
little to raise the class for whom they so zealously
laboured.
When we ask how these poor outcasts have become
what they are, we find that their parents, perhaps
their ancestors for generations, have descended from
the productive or respectable classes to the unproduc-
tive or predatory. The waifs of society, even when
they work, do not produce. Be it through thimble-
rigging, pocket-picking, or begging, they live by the
transference to themselves of what others produce-not
by producing. It appeared, then, that if the children
of these classes-so many of them at least as filled the
Ragged Schools-could be brought from the unproduc-
tive class in which they were born into the respective
and productive rank, there would be a clear gain to
society. This was the principle on which training
in skilled labour-in the occupation of the tailor,
the shoemaker, the carpenter, and the smith-was
applied to the Ragged Schools, which have been gra-
dually changing their name to Industrial Schools.
The French writer admits the solidity and unques-
tionable practical advantage of this element. He states
that the principle of Ragged Schools is in itself not free

from question, and that economic criticism may find
abuses in it, but that it has the merit of founding the
industrial system (Le régime des ragged schools n'est
pas inattaquable. La critique économique y pourrait
relever des abus; mais enfin L'Angleterre doit a ces
écoles la première application un peu large de l'enseigne-
ment industriel.)
The author justly attributes the merit of commencing
the system to the United Industrial School of Edin-
burgh, where it is still among the best managed
(L'Unité Industrielle Ecole d'Edinbourg, une de celles
où l'enseignement pratique est le mieux organisé, &c.)
In this establishment it has not only been found that
lads, after they are there for from two to three years,
are readily taken by tradesmen who give them good
wages, and are thus fairly started in an independent
carcer in life; but the training has been very useful to
the discipline of the establishment in giving an object
sufficient to occupy the minds of a set of creatures
whose way of life has prematurely excited their energies
and capacities.
Nothing, however, could exhibit better the contrast
between the practical habits of the two nations than

of private benevolence, but would connect it with the
national economy, and have a vast system of industrial
training (au lieu d'appartenir au domaine de la bien-
faisance, les écoles industrielles deviennent en France

tical country, a few gentlemen go down a dark close,
and get a few carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, &c. to
teach their trades to a set of charity children, carefully
watching the progress of the operation lest it turn out
to be a fallacy in their hands. But no sooner does the
brilliant and theorising Frenchman see its advantages
than he must forthwith find it a grand instrument for
national regeneration. We need not speculate for our

LINES ADDRESSED TO A MINIATURE.
BY A LADY.
Thou knowest not, thou faithful miniature,
The strange delight thy lines to me afford-
Thy mimic features, with their placid mien,
Calm and unmoved, unconscious of my eye!
Here I may gaze and dream, and fear no blame;
-alone.
This I may love and prize unseen-a
How nobly truth and innocence combined
Sit on that brow, and dwell within those eyes!
How sweetly on those closed and manly lips
Firmness and love together hold their sway!
Thy form I see, with strength and courage braced,
Thy glance with all its native energy!
In vain I met, I knew, approved, and loved
Him whose most truthful likeness thou dost bear;
In vain I watched his eye, forestalled his wish,
Welcomed his presence, and his absence mourned:
I learned his flame-1 smoothed his path to joy;
My fate was sealed-his love was not for me!
And there is one who drinks from those fond lips
Words of delight and accents of deep love;
Who reads entranc'd his soul's impassioned rows
From those deep, earnest, and most loving eyes;
On whom his every thought, his every wish
Is fixed, and chill or change shall never know.
And be it so! worthy are ye of bliss!
May Heaven its choicest blessings freely pour,
Strew all your earthly path with fragrant flowers,
And lead to realms of everlasting day!
My heart is rent, my inmost spirit scared,
But prayer and silence shall alone be mine.

THREE FRENCH RIVERS.
SCOTSMAN-LIKE, I have always had a sort of mystic
reverence for celebrated pieces of water, whether rivers,
lakes, or seas. It is one of the features of the national
character to poetise and symbolise the abstract ideas of
our favourite streams. In this respect the Scot is like
the Greek-he breathes life and individuality into the
features of nature. If he do not create river-gods,
fashioning their dreamy forms, and chiselling their
never-exhausted urns, he still entertains a dim, yet
thoroughly-poetic idea of, so to speak, the sentient
individuality of his favourite stream. He collects its
natural attributes, whether sternly magnificent or softly
beautiful, and with them he endows a mystic, symbolic
personage, whose sworn and chivalrous defender he
becomes. Scott well knew the tendency, and has fre-
quently alluded to it. That's the Forth," says the
Bailie, with that air of reverence which I have observed
the Scotch usually pay to their distinguished rivers.
Sir Walter himself, who made the Spirit of the Flood
speak with the Spirit of the Fell, would assuredly have
done valiant battle for any stream between the Cheviots
and Cape Wrath; but he would have died the death in,
honour of his well-loved Tweed. The English have
little of this feeling. A few of the poets-Milton and
l'ope, for example-have individualised and deified the
slow-moving waters of the south; but their writings in
this respect were but the reflex of classicism. They
called up again naiads and water-gods; but the visions
were felt to be mere cold poetical conceits-not hearty,
nationally-stamped impulses. Some years ago I re-
member asking a working-man upon Leeds Bridge the
name of the slow stream beneath.
15..
'Why, it's the reever,' was the reply.
"Yes; but don't you call it by any name in particular?'
'Not as I eveer heeard on: anyway, it ain't no
business of moin!'
You would never, find such thoroughly-stupid boor-
ism: north of the Carter Fell. Not a shock-headed
loon who dabbles in a moorland burn but would tell
you, at all events, the local name of the running
water; not a douce, grave burgler, loitering at Curfew
Linn on the gray, old brig, beneath which pours, with
old and well-timed melody, the fulness of the stream
beside which he was born, but would expatiate by the
hour on its beauties and its merits: the wildness of
its spacts,' and the crystal purity of its pools; with a
passing legend, perhaps, of some ancient ford, or a
smiling but respectful reference, to the kelpie who once
wonned down in the darksome waters of the deep
swirling holes, but who has ages ago extinguished for
ever his candle of death and of dool.'

PRICE 1d.
Smitten, then, with this national instinct of reverence
for rivers, I paid, during a recent ramble in France,
some attention to the characteristics of its three great
rivers- the Loire, the Garonne, and the Rhone--each
of which has its own individuality, and boasts its own
attributes. The French are unlucky in the navigable
qualities of their great rivers. The Seine, though com-
paratively a small stream, is perhaps the best fitted to
be a means of transport; but the genius of the country,
which shrinks, cat-like, from water, has prevented any
really efficient attempts from being made to overcome
the natural obstructions to the passage of boats along
the vast courses of the other streams. The Loire is a
deceitful river. Calm, and gentle, and softly flowing-
swirling on in pleasant streams and smoothly-moving
reaches, amid its green meadows, and clustered vine-
yards, and stretching corn-fields, it can nevertheless
come roaring down from bank to brae with all the fury
of a Grampian torrent. Its course is strangely tor
tuous: rising in the wild regions, of the Auvergne,
amid the extinct volcanoes of that remarkable tract,
and as far south as the country of the olive and the
mulberry, it sweeps through entire central France,
mirroring many an ancient town' and laving many a
historic château ere it flows by Nantes. The Loire,
except in particular spots, is not a pretty river. The
bed is two or three times the width of the actual average
stream, leaving vast expanses of shingle and sand, and
low marshy islands, through which the scanty stream,
divided sometimes into a dozen dribbling branches,
takes its winding way. The main current is seldom
above from four to six feet in depth, and its track
changes, with a curious perversity, from side to side of
the bed, shifting and winding between islet and sand-
bank, sometimes overflowed, and sometimes left dry
and whitening in the sun. But the Loire, in flood, is
not to be trifled with. The general line of the country
through which it passes is low, the valley being wide
and shallow, and the adjacent haughs rich and flat. At
intervals, therefore, huge dikes or dams have been
constructed. The work was begun as early as the
Valois kings; but the levées, as they are called, are'
continually being broken into; and all along the river,
from Roanne in the central south, you see upon bridges
and house-walls a deeply-cut arrow-head, marked crue
de 1846--the memorial of a flood which, from Orleans
downwards, laid the valley of the Loire under water.
"A voyage up the Loire in one of the sailing-barges
which manage to navigate it would be an excellent
expedition for a traveller fond of taking his time on the
way. These great boats always sail in fleets made fast
to each other. They are flat-bottomed, and carry one
huge mast, upon which is spread one vast sheet of very

white canvas-only adapted, however, to be displayed
when the wind is right astern. If the westerly breeze
be strong, the squadron makes comparatively decent
way, except in the more rapid streams, in ascending
which it is amusing to watch their struggles. Now,
perhaps, a rattling gust of wind, which makes all the
long rows of soldier-like poplars in the neighbour-
hood buffet each other lustily, sweeps angrily over
the ruffled current; the big sails swell and surge; the
long and thin, but well-stayed mast bends and qui-
vers; and up goes the fleet gallantly, flinging the water
from their huge square booms. In a moment, how-
ever, the force of the gust lulls; the masts straighten
from the strain; and the upward motion of the squa-
dron comes to a gentle stop. Sometimes I have
watched a fleet motionless for ten minutes in a rapid
stream; the force of the current just counterbalanced
by the strength of the wind-the boats sometimes gain-
ing a foot or two, at others losing as much-and hours
perhaps consumed in the ascent of a few hundred yards.
The appearance of these large squadrons in the more
softly-flowing reaches of the river is very beautiful.
You watch them threading the channels between the
labyrinthine wooded islets, the white sails glancing
amid the trees, and then perhaps emerging into a broad
shallow bend, following from bank to bank the devious
channel.
dours-one Jasmin, a barber, and a man of high poetic
abilities-yet dwells at Agen, on the Garonne, and yet
sings ditties similar in spirit to those which Coeur-de-
Lion proposed to chant-in oc or in oui'-to the
holy clerk of Copmanhurst; when that reverend per-
sonage indignantly preferred a good old English ballad
to all the 'ocs and ouis of France.'
There is little traffic on the Garonne, with the excep-
tion of the reaches above Bordeaux, up and down
which boats laden with country productions for the
city's use ply incessantly. It is a sight, early on an
autumnal morning, to see these arks, laden to the
water's edge with piled-up masses of grapes, plums,
and melons, disembarking their contents above the
great stone-bridge of Bordeaux. The air is sickly with
the fragrance, and the shore an absolute chaos of
massed and heaped-up luscious fruit. The valley of
the Garonne, however, with all its actual riches, looks
poor and bleak. The river often winds between bare
chalk cliffs, pouring a yellow, muddy flood from side to
side of its piled and built-up banks; the villages are
dead and dreary-looking places, mouldering and crum-
bling to decay; but the populousness of the country
is shewn in the vast number of wire suspension-bridges
which span the stream. At a distance these structures
look very commanding; but a close inspection shews
how weakly and how coarsely they are built. The
diligences crawl cautiously along them, amid such a
storm of cracking and creaking, that I was often well
pleased when we turned our backs upon the river. It
is far up the stream, however-about the roots of the
Pyrenees-that the Garonne shews its best points. At
Bordeaux it is half water and half yellow mud, but still
flowing with a strong and sweeping current. Iligher
up towards Agen and Toulouse, it is a dull drumly
stream-often in the summer-time leaving great ex-
panses of shingle bare, and broken here and there into
futile rapids by the projection of shelves of rock across
the bed. But issuing from the boxwood-covered gorges
of the Pyrenees, the Garonne is a glorious Alpine
stream, plunging on its way in foaming, whirling
eddies, amid masses of disjointed rocks, swirling round
and round in clear, deep, rippling pools, or bickering
over the slimy shingle with a gay, poppling sound-
pleasant green haughs upon the banks, and gowan-
covered knolls, and many a ragged mountain - urchin
It is between Blois and Angers that the Loire at-
tains its most perfect beauty. There France is really
'la belle.' There the fairest landscapes of the king-
dom-combining the freshness of the north with the
richness of the south-spread gloriously along the river
banks. The corn grows richly as in the Beauce; the
apple, luxuriantly as in Normandy; the maize, yellow as
in the hottest Pyrenean valley; the grape, luxuriant
as in the sunny terraces of the Rhone; and there, too,
passed the most picturesque scenes of mediaval France.
The Valois kings loved the Loire, and studded Touraine
with their châteaux. It was from the castle of Blois
--the Windsor of France-that the dark power of the
Medici family radiated. It was at Chambord--the
finest specimen of the antique château between the
North Sea and the Mediterranean-that the easy-going
Francis I. caroused; and you may still see the moul-
dering stones of Plessis-les-Tours, where Louis XI.
plotted with Oliver le Mauvais, and gossipped with
Tristan l'Hermite. Here, again, at Chinon-a para-paidling in the burn.'
dise of vines, and groves, and softly-flowing waters-
Joan of Arc broke in on the easy revelry of the seventh
Charles. Diana of Poitiers is for ever associated with
the halls where her emblematic crescent still glitters.
And this, too, was the country of the gentle Agnes
Sorrel. Again, what a glorious bead - roll of ancient
towns stud this delicious land: Blois, in all its
mediæval picturesqueness; Tours, redolent of Louis
XI. and his Scottish archer-guard; Amboise, a model
of the town called into existence by the feudal fortress;
Saumur, an old Protestant stronghold; Angers, from
whence came our own Plantagenet kings-more
antique-looking than even Blois; and Nantes, the
thriving capital of Brittany.
So far as volume of water goes, the Rhone is un-
doubtedly the queen of French rivers. The Seine goes
sleepingly and dreamingly along; the Loire, when not
in flood, murmurs musically from island to island, and
steals tranquilly by the shingle whitening in the sun;
the Garonne, by the time its tributaries have converted
it into a first-class river, is only rapid and fierce at
certain points; but the Rhone throughout its course,
from Geneva to the muddy Delta in which it loses
itself and oozes into the Mediterranean, is a wild, tur-
bulent, headlong river, driving down in breathless
haste and majestic force towards the sea. The stream
is therefore held in very great awe by the dwellers on
its shores. A sudden melting of the snow upon the
Turn to the Garonne, and we leave all such deeply-Swiss hills is a matter of very serious import to the
interesting historical associations behind us. The great
river of Gascony rolls a rapid pea-soup-coloured flood
along a course curiously destitute of general interest,
except perhaps such as may be derived high up in its
course from recollections of the Albigenses, and in
more modern days from the struggle at Toulouse be-
tween Wellington and Soult. In the plains watered
by the Garonne, however, the 'gai science' originated.
Languedoc and Gascony sent forth the first of the
minstrels and troubadours. The tongue in which the
sirventes and lais chanted by these wandering gentle-
men were written, still exists in the common patois
of the peasantry; and the race of which Blondell was a
member is not yet extinct. The last of the trouba-
bank towns, from Arles upwards; and I have been
more than once struck by the anxious faces watching
the mighty rush of the impetuous flood when the river
was considerably higher than its ordinary level. The
Rhone alone of the French streams still boasts a few
bridges of boats upon the common German plan.
There are other ancient structures of stone, the shoot-
ing of which-particularly of one at Pont St Esprit-
was a feat in the days of old. It was on the Rhone at
Tournon-a place close to the celebrated Hermitage
Vineyards-that the first French suspension-bridge
was erected; and since then they have multiplied
rapidly-in general, however, the same flimsy, un-
finished-looking structures so common on the Garonne.

As may be guessed, the Rhone shews little favour to
barge navigators. It is a capital stream to float a
vessel down with; but revocare gradus is the difficulty.
Many barges are despatched from Lyons and the higher
towns towards Avignon and the Delta, laden with mer-
chandise, which is disembarked at its destination, and
the boat-a rude, ill-put-together affair-broken up for
firewood. This is generally the case with the coal-
barges floated down from the mining country below
Lyons. Other vessels, however, achieve the upward
passage; but their number is fast diminishing, as
steam is making its way upon the river. The Rhone
barges, like those of the Loire, sail in fleets, but never
make use of canvas. A whole troop of track-cavalry
tugs each lumbering squadron. Three or four barges,
fastened to each other, are often dragged by thirty or
forty horses, scrambling on the banks, plunging into
the water, often dragged off their legs as the desperate
eddies and flows of current wrench round the boats
with irresistible force. The voyage of an amphibious
caravan of this sort, from Beaucaire to Lyons, used
frequently to occupy from six weeks to two months,
and the squadron was lucky which made the passage
without the loss of two or three of its horses. The
labour these poor beasts undergo soon breaks them up,
even if they escape being dragged into the river and
drowned in their harness. The upward navigation of
the Rhone, indeed, without steam aid, was mere wanton
folly; and accordingly the vast mass of the products of
the south, and the denrées coloniales' which every
country grocer in France paints over his shop-door,
are brought northward in great caravans of carts and
wagons, which daily and nightly, at every hour of the
twenty-four, toil monotonously along eternally the up-
and-down and dusty glaring road.
The Rhone scenery in some degree resembles that of
the Rhine; but it is far tamer, and less varied. Like
the Rhine, the French river loses itself in divers
branches in a flat and marshy country-forming to-
wards the mouths of the Delta a dreary expanse of rice-
swamps and salt-morasses-burned up by an almost
tropically-powerful sun-continually overspread with
dark night-mists, and haunted by perpetual fever.
Higher up, the Rhone passes through the dry, parched
olive country, amid stony tracts of brown, gravelly
hills. This applies to the district about Arles and
Beaucaire. Ascending to Avignon, and beyond it to
Valence, we get into the mulberry district-the olives
and the almonds disappearing, and the more stately
timber of Midland France taking their places, with the
vine everywhere. It is above Valence, however, that
the characteristic features of the river appear. During
a long summer day, you steam windingly between two
unbroken ranges of brown, undulating hills, vineyards
from the water's edge to the summit. The quantity
of the fruit cultivated is surprising. On and on for
scores of miles, between two enormous screens of vines,
every square inch of the mountain-side terraced and
cultivated, as if the soil were the last left of the world.
Here and there, upon a rocky peak, towers the gray
and Rhine-like feudal château, generally in ruins.
Along the river's bank extends the long, straggling,
brown-burnt village, and a far-stretching line of flying
dust, streaking with white the green expanses of the
vinés, indicates the track of the road on either bank.
Between these the Rhone rushes in the fierce, sullen
majesty of its might-the idea suggested by the river
being always one of power and strength, never of grace
or beauty.
There are certain features which appertain to all
French streams, big and little: the clumsiness and
apparent frailty of the barges used, for instance the
rickety and miserable look of the smaller boats,
generally mere flat boxes, rowed with machinery like
wooden spades-all speak of the anti-aquatic habits of
the people. On the seacoast they learn to build ships
|
|
as well as other nations; but up the country they
never take kindly to the water, or aught that concerns
it. You never see in a French river-town anything
like the pleasure-wherry-the smart gig and funnies
which in England would be floating on the water by
the score. The punts employed are used for purely
business purposes-Paris, which is a miniature repre-
sentation of all Europe, and as such having borrowed
some of our English customs, being the only exception
to the general rule. On the Seine there are a few
canots the pale reflexes of London-four, six, and
eight-oared galleys; but at Lyons, for example, on the
Rhone, at Macon on the Saone, at Bordeaux on the
Garonne, and at Tours, Orleans, Saumur, and so forth,
on the Loire, I never saw the ghost of a pleasure-
skiff, or heard that the rivers were ever used as a
means of recreation and wholesome exercise, except
in swimming. The barges, again, are frequently very
large, but very flimsily built, and generally unpainted.
They have a family-likeness on all rivers, particu-
larly in the extraordinary awkwardness of the ma-
chinery with which they are steered-the tiller often
consisting of a vast beam of wood, weighing more
than a ton, one end of it flattened and widened by
means of nailed boards attached, the other running
as far forwards as the mast. The steersman reaches
it by means of a platform, and the whole mass is
poised upon the stern. The washing establishments
form another French river feature. In summer they
seem all very well-bating the rude usage which the
linen appears always to be subjected to; but in winter
it makes one shudder to see the bands of women, with
their bare arms up to the elbows in the icy stream. A
blanchisseuse has probably no very pleasant life of it
in any country, but the French sisterhood must un-
doubtedly be amongst the greatest victims. In Eng-
land such operations are usually conducted by the side
of comfortable stoves and steaming-coppers; but cer-
tainly our neighbours, with all their reverence for
Napoleon, pay but little attention to the literal inter-
pretation at least of one of his most noted maxims—

LYDIA, THE FOOLAH SLAVE.
IN cruising along the western shores of Africa, we
touched at Freetown, the principal settlement of Sierra
Leone. This is a colony of liberty and of death: giving
freedom and all its blessings to a vast number of en-
slaved Africans, whilst the noxious climate has made
it proverbially the white man's grave.' At the end of
December the weather was charming; for although the
thermometer ranged high there was a cool breeze from
the sea, and the air was balmy and elastic, imparting a
cheerful vigour to the animal and mental frames. I
could scarcely imagine that a few months previously
the yellow fever had made such dreadful ravages, or
that in a few months later most of the European inha-
bitants would be suffering from debility or fever from
the hot vapours of the rainy season and the miasma
which arises from putrid vegetation.
.
Freetown itself is an interesting place, well situated
on a rising-ground near the river, with a high hill at
its back. It contains more than 16,000 inhabitants, of
whom 300 or 400 are Europeans, the rest are mulat-
toes and free blacks. The negroes are of a great
variety of tribes, forming a miniature representation of
the nations and languages of Central Africa. Under
the fostering care of European missionaries and school-
masters, many of the coloured population have ac-
quired the rudiments of knowledge, and are become
industrious, intelligent, and well-behaved. The con-
trast between this settlement and any native town in

its natural rudeness is so marked as to be highly
pleasing to the friends of Africa, and I could scarcely
regret the valuable lives which have been sacrificed in
producing this oasis of a desert continent-this refuge
from slavery and barbarism in a blighted land, Free-
town is surrounded with about twenty small towns and
villages, in which nearly 40,000 liberated slaves are
settled under care of the British government. Each
has his own plot of ground, on which he erects his
hut, and uses as a yard or garden according to his
convenience.
:
As I was strolling through one of these towns, look- |
ing about with prying curiosity to see African manners
improved by civilisation, I was accosted by an intelli-
gent woman, of comely appearance, and of a lighter
complexion than I had supposed to belong to the negro
race. She was neatly dressed in native costume,
having a garment thrown elegantly round her breast
and shoulders, whilst another covered the lower part
of the body she wore European shoes, and had her
hair fastened with a pretty handkerchief. She spoke
broken English in a fluent manner, her language shew-
ing that she was accustomed to read. After a few
minutes' conversation, she invited me into her dwelling
to take a seat, and refresh myself with a drink of milk.
The hut which I entered was of superior workman-
ship, consisting of two apartments, besides outhouses,
and containing some articles of good furniture: it was
quite as neat and comfortable as an ordinary cottage in
England, though nccessarily in a lighter style. Two or
three fine children, not so fair in skin as their mother,
were playing about the door, clothed in a simple shirt
or frock-quite enough for this warm climate. Her
husband had gone out to look after some cattle. After
various questions, which she answered with readiness,
she yielded to my importunate request for a short
narrative of her eventful life, which she gave to the
following effect :---
I belong to one of the Foolah tribes who dwell in
the interior of this country. The pastoral Foolahs
have whiter skins than the other negroes: my hus-
band is a Fencolar, speaking the same language, but
of a darker colour. I remember nothing of my earliest
childhood, and was never told about it by any person;
nor do I know where my parents lived, nor where I
was born. I have a faint recollection of dwelling in a
village, composed of wattled' huts, and surrounded with
a stockade: it had one broad street in the middle, with
cane-houses on either side, each in a little plot or gar-
den. I played about all day with my infant brother
and other children of our tribe: we did not wear any
clothes, for these are not used by children in Africa.
My father and his people-for he was head man of the
town-used to keep eattle, and were obliged to take
them in the dry weather wherever pasturage could be
obtained. This is all I remember of my first home.
We were never allowed to go out of the town by our-
selves, lest we should be stolen by men or devoured by
wild beasts. So we lived in safety though not in peace;
for in Africa there is nothing sure save the vast forests,
the desert sands, and the mighty rivers: these must
always remain--but man has no quiet there. We are in
constant fear of enemies, and we never know when to
expect a foe. We are like a canoe in the water when
the paddles are lost and a strong wind is blowing-we
are like the chickens when the screaming hawks are
flying over our heads-like the bleating goats when the
howling wolves surround the fold.
J
Our stockade kept out the wild beasts at night, but
it could not save us from the attack of wild men, for
in poor Africa there is little in our houses which the
wicked can steal; so they come to rob us of liberty
and all we hold dear in life. We never grudged
paying the Mandingoes for keeping us safe; and though
their chiefs often imposed upon us, and asked many
presents, we did not complain.
We were one night sweetly asleep as usual, the
children lying on a wicker-frame at one side of the hut,
and our parents occupying another on the opposite side.
We were as birds in a nest, for our tribe was at peace
with all around, and we paid a tribute to the king in
whose country we sojourned. At midnight we were
awakened by a great shout, and I felt much frightened,
for I had never heard so loud a noise except from the
thunder of heaven. It grew louder and louder like a
mighty tornado crashing the trees, and sweeping every-
thing before the terrible blast. Men's voices were now
heard, and my father seized two spears which stood
against the hut, and ran out. My mother was just
following when we heard a loud noise of guns, and all
was for a moment silent, like the still calm which pre-
vails before a tempest blows. Then my mother ran in
shrieking, and seizing us children, threw us under the
bed and spread the clothes over, telling us to be quite
quiet whoever might come in. We lay there in trem-
bling suspense for a few minutes, when she again
hurried us out; and we saw a great light as if all the
town was on fire. The roof of our own house was
burning, and we ran out to escape the flames. Near
the door I saw the body of my father, covered with
blood, his hands still grasping the spears. I called him
to rise and come away with us, but he returned no
answer; and my mother hurried us into the middle of
the street. We there found ourselves surrounded by
savage men, who bade us keep together, and then drove
us like a flock of goats out of the burning town. There
I saw all our cattle collected, and the women and the
children of our tribe, and a few of the young men with
their hands tied behind them; but we had passed by
many dead bodies.
As soon as it began to be light we were driven into
the forest, and made to go very fast, never stopping till
the sun was quite high. When any of the children
were tired and could not walk farther, they were given
to the women to be carried. Some of these were old,
and were themselves feeble, and they did not care to go
into slavery; so they refused to go forward. They were
then beaten, and if they still refused they were pierced
with a spear, and left to be devoured by the hyænas and
wolves which followed at a distance, for they know the
track of the man-hunter. The bloody vultures also
screamed over our heads, and I have been told that
they often fight with the beasts for the bodies of the
slain. At last we were all tired with walking and
with the sun, and faint with hunger and thirst. We
reached a river which we crossed, and sat down under
the trees of the opposite bank, for the men could there
see if any one was pursuing them. At last they judged
that all was safe, especially as they were now far in
another king's country, who was friendly to some of
themselves. When the cofile had rested and our captors
had satisfied their hunger-for we had nothing to eat,
only they gave the children a little milk-it was then
agreed partly to divide the spoil. Some of the men-
hunters were quite strange to us, speaking a language
we did not understand, and having come from a great

distance; but others were wicked men who lived in a
country not far from our own, and who had joined the
hunters and led them to our unhappy town for a booty.
The women with their infants, and the young men and
elder children, were taken by the strangers, because
they could travel, and it was needful that they should
remove far away from their homes, lest they should
find means of escape from bondage; but the little
children who could not walk far, and who were heavy
to carry, and who were not likely to know anything of
the country, were given with most of the cattle to the
hunters, who lived in the neighbourhood. In this divi-
sion I was separated from my mother and my little
brother, whom she carried on her back. My mother
begged hard to have me with her, and cried and tore
her hair; but they forced her away, threatening to
take her infant if she would not be quiet. She then
desisted, and covering me with kisses, she wrung her
hands in anguish, and bade me a long farewell. There
were gloomy prospects before us all, but we only knew a
part of our wo we were like a sheep which mourns for
her lambs that are killed, but does not know the fate
which soon awaits herself.
?
望
​Next day the party who had us for their prey
reached their own town, and made a feast because of
their success. The cattle and children were indis-
criminately divided amongst the robbers, and my mas-
ter went home exulting with two little slaves and many
head of cattle. We were well used, and had little to
complain of, in our childish forgetfulness of the past
and ignorance of the future. The women who belonged
to my master-for he had several wives-tilled the
ground and prepared the food, and they were kind to
us in our orphan condition; but I could never look at
my owner save with feelings of horror, for visions of
the bloody deed which he had done followed me by day
and haunted me by night. It was too terrible a scene
to pass away from my memory; and when I heard the
other children calling "father" and "mother," I felt
angry at him who had deprived me of both.
1
After a time my slave-companion was parted from
me, being sold to a dealer who came round the neigh
bourhood. My master received in exchange some rum
and tobacco. He would have sold me at the same
time, but his chief wife wanted me to take care of her
baby. After some years, when I was beginning to
grow tall, she sent me into the field, for she claimed
me as her slave, and I always obeyed her orders.
Field-work was harder than that in the house, but I
was not displeased to be away from my master, whom
I could not bear to look upon; besides, he was a pas-
sionate man, often drunk, and then his fury was
ungovernable, till they stupified him with liquor, in
which state he would lie for days together. On one
occasion when he was absent a Moor passed by, and
my mistress called me and shewed me to him. He
examined me all over very attentively, looked plea-
santly at me, and afterwards had a conversation with
her on the subject. She then gave me to understand
that the Moor had offered a good price for me at the
end of six months, provided I then looked well and
plump. She praised my beauty, and said that I should
go to live with the Moor, but that I must take care
to answer his expectations. For this purpose I was
brought from working in the fields, was well fed, and
had to drink a large quantity of camel's milk cach
morning. Thus, sir, we are treated like the cattle:
like them we are bought and sold, and like them we
are gorged with food when it answers our owner's pur-
pose.
The time fixed upon was fast approaching, but I
looked forward to it with far less interest than did my
mistress. She was expecting my price in a quantity
of necklaces, bracelets, and a fine shawl, which the
Moor had promised to give for me if I were in good
condition, and she spoke much about the hoped-for
finery. I cared little about the matter, feeling no
interest in the barter; whether I were a slave or a
slave-wife made little difference, and would scarcely
alter my condition of servitude. My thoughts were
very limited, and provided I should be well treated
and have plenty to eat, I little cared where I was or to
whom I belonged. I had no idea of a soul or of a
future state, but regarded myself as one of the cattle-
only having a more beautiful structure of body than
they. I knew more than the cows, but not more than
the ants and bees, and the sagacious elephant. What
I heard of these creatures often made me wish that I
for to-day, heedless of to-morrow, and nothing but my
was as free and as wise as they seemed to be. I lived
daily employment had ever exercised my mind. My
master never prayed, for he was a Soninkee or drunken
infidel, and knew not God. We had dances at particu-
lar times of the year, and some of the people made
offerings to idols, and we wore greegrees or amulets to
keep away danger and discase; but we knew no more.
The Moors, however, have a sacred book, and some of
the negro nations worship Allah as they do; but this
is for the men, not for the women.
薯
​The expectations of my mistress turned out like
other African hopes-they were written on sand, which
is scattered by a sudden whirlwind. One day while
I was weaving cloth beside her, we were surprised by a
small party of horsemen who dashed into the yard.
All the men of the place were absent, which these free-
booters had ascertained by their spies. They instantly
seized us and as many more women as they could find,
each taking up one upon his horse, and rode off at full
gallop. It was the work of a moment, and we were all
carried away my mistress, her child, and the other
wives, sharing in the same captivity with their slaves.
In Africa a man may be great to-day and very little
to-morrow, and he that plundered his neighbour's
house yesterday may have his own home broken up
next morning. When my master came home from
looking after the cattle which he had stolen he would
find his huts desolate, and might have no information
about the robbers-only that they were Moors.
--
The sufferings connected with this second captivity
were severe, but short compared with those endured by
other Africans. After riding for a short time at great
speed through the forest, and finding there was no pur-
suit, our captors dismounted their victims, and forming
us into a group, they drove us like a herd of cattle at a
rapid pace. If any one began to lag behind a rope was
tied about her neck, and she was dragged and goaded
forward to keep up with the rest. We travelled hard
for two days toward the south, when we reached a town
where they traffic in slaves, and there the dealers soon
purchased us of the Moors. The slave-merchants into
whose hands we had now fallen were expecting a coffle
toward the western coast, where a small vessel was
lying in a creck of the Rio Grande waiting for a cargo.
This circumstance saved me much bodily torment,
which must have been caused by a long journey to the
Gold Coast, and by the inflictions of a tedious voyage.
The place of our embarkation was a hazardous one for
the trade, being so near the British settlements; but it
was attended with many advantages if the slaver could
only get clear of the coast: it was a short but danger-
ous enterprise. We were detained for a few days at the
water-side, waiting until an expected cruiser had passed
by the mouth of the river; then we were huddled at
night into a small slaver, which immediately set sail.
But who can describe our wretchedness during the next
two days-being, cooped up between decks, unable to
sit upright, or even to change our posture, and nearly
suffocated for want of air? A light wind had driven
the slaver from the shore, and then left her becalmed
in sight of land. This added to our sufferings; since

there was no ventilation in the ship's hold, and though
we were perfectly naked the heat was intolerable. To
keep us alive we were released for a few hours in the
morning, and sent to take air on the deck. The sight
of Africa's mountains, and gloomy anticipations of what
might yet befall us at sea and in distant lands, filled
us with melancholy; but we were almost past feeling
through fatigue and exhaustion. Perhaps I was as
heedless of my fate as any on board, as I had not left
behind any one for whom I cared. The only being
in whom I had felt interested for many years was my
mistress's daughter, who had been taken sick on the
road, and was left by the Moors to be devoured by the
wild beasts.
While looking over the side of the vessel at the
huge sharks which swam around us, as if waiting for
the body of some dead negro to be thrown overboard-
for these fish are said to know and follow the slave-
ships-I was struck with the appearance of a dark
object coming towards us: it looked like a ship, but it
had no sails, and I could not tell how it moved. It
seemed to have a short, thick mast in the middle, out of

the captain and sailors were greatly alarmed. They
looked at it through a long tube, and then consulted
together. At first they thought of throwing us all
overboard, and even came to lay hold upon us for that
purpose; but we shrieked and struggled, and as we had
no clothes to hold us by, they soon found it would be
too long a work, especially as there was an under-deck
full of male slaves still below. Meanwhile the flying-
ship was coming quickly down upon us, so the seamen
lowered two little boats, and jumping in, rowed with
all their strength towards the shore, which they soon
reached, and disappeared in one of the creeks. The
steamboat, as I have since heard it called, came close
alongside. She was full of men, who had swords and
pistols; others stood with matches in their hands ready
to fire their great guns, with which I am told they
can sink a vessel much larger than the slaver. Several
finely-dressed men leaped on board, but finding that all
the crew were gone, they put up their swords and spoke
kindly to us, telling one of their black sailors to inform
us in the Mandingo language that we were all free, and
would soon again be set ashore on Africa. The fetters
of the male slaves were knocked off, food was given us,
and we had as much water as we could drink, for we
were parched with thirst.

In a very short time-for white men do things very
quickly-all was got ready for sailing. A large rope

was dragged through the water to Sierra Leone.
cannot think of our wonder and joy, our surprise and
delight. It was like a dream; but I had never dreamed
anything half so astonishing. To be delivered in a
moment from slavery and sorrow; to be on the way
back to Africa; and all this to be done by a ship which
went without sails, which swam with fins like a fish,
and belched smoke and fire from its mast! I knew not
where I was, nor whether my head or feet were upper-
most. At sunset of next day we reached Sierra Leone,
and my surprise was increased by the sight of the place.
Such large houses appeared at a short distance!-such
fine soldiers came down to the sea!-such finely-dressed
men and women, white and black, walked about!
Many black people came to look at us, and to see if
they had any friend among us; and all spoke to us
kind and pleasant words.
When we had been taken to the King's Yard, and
been washed and dressed, some people came to take
apprentices, and among others the man who is now
my husband. He is a Foolah, but not of the same tribe
as myself: he was once a slave, but had now been
several years in the colony, and having worked hard he
had raised himself to respectability. Perceiving my

receiving an answer he asked me how I had been cap-
tured.
When I had finished he immediately went and spoke
about me to the government officer, and then took me
to his house, where he and his wife treated me kindly.
They remembered that they too had been slaves and
strangers in a foreign land, and they pitied me, for
they were good people. My mistress was young, but
she was sickly, and she had an infant which she wished
me to take care of. I was also to help her in all matters
about the house, which was easy employment. She
was a very sweet woman, and I soon loved her much:
she treated me more as a companion than a servant,
and I was never so happy as in fulfilling her wishes.
A few days after I arrived was the Sabbath. I was
surprised that the people did no work on that day, but
all dressed themselves in their best clothes, and when a
bell rang they went to a large house like a store-room,
but much larger and finer. They told me it was called
a church, where they sang and prayed, and heard a

of Lydia, and became a happy member of the Christian
church, being now able to speak a little English, and
to understand something of what the minister said.
My sweet mistress continued sick for two years; and
though we had a white doctor to attend her, she grew
worse, and died. It was a time of great trouble to us
all, and to none more than to myself. I loved her very
much, even as my own soul; for she was always kind to
me, and had taught me much that was good. She died
in the faith; and I have often thought that if ever there
was one on earth who was prepared by gentleness,
purity, and peace, for a holy heaven, it was my dear
mistress.
When my apprenticeship was nearly finished I had
grown to womanhood, and was now tall and comely.
Two or three young men were making proposals of
marriage, which my master said should be entirely left
to my own choice; only he advised me not to be in a
hurry in coming to a decision, for I should easily get a
good husband, and now I had a comfortable home. He
had not taken another wife, and there was nobody who
loved his child as I did, so I said that I would remain
with him as long as he pleased. One day he brought
home a new dress, which he told me to put on; he said
that I looked very nice in it, and I replied that it was
too fine for a servant. He said that he wished me to
go with him to a wedding the next week, and that I
must be dressed for the occasion. Upon my asking
who was going to be married, he said that it was him-
self, and that he hoped to have me for a wife. Such a
thought had never entered my head, and I was quite
perplexed; but the result was that I became his happy
bride. Since then my life has been as peaceful as a
flowing river on a fine morning. It has always been
the dry season in our house-no rains, no tornadoes of
sorrow, have ever troubled our dwelling. We negroes
are naturally a quiet race, and the Foolahs are timid
and gentle; and when religion makes a Foolah's heart
right, filling it with love to God and man, it is as
peaceful as the blue sky-as happy as the pretty birds
which fly about the bushes. My youthful sorrows are
almost forgotten, except to contrast them with my
present blessedness, and to thank God and the English
for this colony of Sierra Leone. This is a hill on which

we live when the floods arise and cover the ground; it
is a house of stone when the fierce tornado blows and
destroys the huts; it is the shadow of a large tree
when the sun smites the earth with his strong heat.
GOETHE'S TASSO.
Ir has been remarked by Mr R. P. Gillies, that Tasso's
records of his own unhappy existence are far more
interesting and romantic than the most elaborate of his
poems, although the said records are only the chronicle
of his wayward caprices and miseries. "The scene
only changes from the palace or convent to the prison
vaults, and the vicissitudes of feeling are from the
dazzling illusions of hope to the dark, heavy clouds of
despondency.'* The minstrel-now dwelling in kings'
houses, now pining in durance vile-was he who sang
'Jerusalem Delivered,' who in palace and prison could
see farther and feel more deeply than his fellows: like
his own hero-
Molto egli oprò col senno e con la mano,
Molto soffri nel glorioso acquisto.'+
Stone walls and iron bars could not indeed exclude the
vision and the faculty divine, but they could stifle and
distort the poet's aspirations-they could bruise and
batter the wings of this poor struggling 'bird of para-
dise.' For, as Byron has it-
Form'd of far too penetrable stuff,
These birds of paradise but long to flee
Back to their native mansion; soon they find
Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree,
And die, or are degraded."
The pilgrim in Italy, as he paces the dull, deserted
thoroughfares of Ferrara, looks up wistfully at the
grated windows of St Anna's Hospital, and bethinks
him of a time when at one of those windows might be
scen, day after day, the earnest, pallid face of Torquato
Tasso, peering anxiously through the bars-' a face
handsome, but extremely sad, rather past middle life,
but haggard beyond its age; the hair, though partially
white, falling down in delicate curls from the high and
somewhat wrinkled forehead; the cheeks pale and
ghastly, as of one just recovering from severe illness;
thin lips, anxiously parted from one another, and
shewing the white teeth set; eyes preternaturally
bright, and fixed with an intense gaze down the
street.'§ Tasso's situation under the duke's lock and
key was, as Shelley observes, widely different from
that of any persecuted being of the present day; for
from the depth of dungeons, public opinion might now
at length be awakened to an echo that would startle
the oppressor; but then there was no hope.
To represent in a dramatic poem--for such, rather
than a drama, is Goethe's 'Tasso'-this 'victor unsur-
passed in modern song,' on whose name attend the
tears and praises of all time,' was a task worthy of
Germany's chiefest bard. The action of the piece is
comprised within some dozen hours; but, as Miss
Swanwick remarks, by skilfully availing himself of
retrospect and anticipation, Goethe has presented us
with a beautiful epitome of the poet's life. The period
is that signalised by the completion of his great epic-a
work which has elevated him, says Sismondi,** perhaps
above all modern poets. (The peut-être in the French-
man's criticism is of infinite importance, in the ears at
least of the countrymen of Shakspeare and Milton.)
We see him a guest of Duke Alphonso, in the beautiful
retreat of Belriguardo, where Petrarch was entertained

and Ariosto found his models. He is surrounded with
objects from which a happier temperament might have
extracted the means of tranquil happiness. Not yet
has Alphonso bound him fast in misery and iron, or done
aught to merit the indignant denunciation of Childe
Harold; not yet had occurred that hegira of the dis-
tracted minstrel from Ferrara to Sorrento, when,
disguised in shepherd's garb, he told his own tale so
touchingly to Cornelia, that the fond sister fainted
with grief; not yet had he known imprisonment in the
hospital of St Anna; not yet wandered to and fro,
honoured indeed, but miserable, seeking rest and
finding none. But for all these sorrows Goethe pre-
pares us. He reveals the forecast shadow of coming
events. The cloud may be no bigger than a man's
hand, but it is there: it is dark, lowering, grimly fore-
boding; and with the fifth act the rustling of its heavy
drops is heard, and we feel that the storm is begun.
That Goethe has drawn a faithful portrait of this
sensitive, irritable, melancholy genius, so far as actual
history rather than ideal art is concerned, appears
undeniable. For instance, in one of Alphonso's descrip-
tions-
'Thus to secure my favour, he betrays,
At times, unseemly ardour; against some
Who, I am well assured, are not his foes
He cherishes suspicion; if by chance
A letter go astray, a hireling leave
His service, or a paper be mislaid,
He sees deception, treachery, and fraud
Working insidiously to sap his peace.' *
So in Leonora's remonstrance-
And oh, dear friend, that Heaven would grant me this-
To make it clear to thee ere thou departest,
That in thy fatherland there is not one
Pursues thee, hates, or covertly molests.
Thou art deceived! and as for others' pleasure
Thou'rt wont to practise thine inventive art,
So in this case thou weav'st a cunning web
To blind thyself, the which to rend asunder
I'll do mine utmost, that with vision clear
Thou may'st pursue life's glad career untrammell'd.'
Tasso's love for the princess is fervently told. Her he
glorifies in every strain. Now exalting her to the starry
heavens-now stealing after her through silent fields,
hallowing her every movement, blessing the music of
her every footfall-
'His loved ideal from the spheres he brings,
And doth invest it with the name she bears.'
When, in the palace gardens, she takes the laurel
crown from Virgil's bust and places it on Tasso's
bending head-an emblem of the crown that awaits
him in the capital -he quivers beneath its gentle
pressure, as though it were a sunbeam on his brain,
scorching up the power of thought.
---
'Whatever in his song doth reach the heart
And find an echo there, he owes to one,
And one alone,'
to whom he passionately consecrates, once and for ever,
his whole being.
Tasso's first appearance on the scene is with the
completed epic in his hand, which he comes to present
to his patron, who receives it with graceful compliments.
His happiness for the moment is exuberant--happiness
such as poet's electric blood alone can so intensely feel
and so swiftly lose. Antonio enters; and lo! Paradise
Lost! Antonio is the hard-headed practical man of the
world-sage, deliberate, politic, courteous, conventional,
and his entrée is as through a nightmare of materialism-
'Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen
ademptum,'

had come to perch its intolerable weight on the breast
of the transcendental dreamer. Antonio and Tasso
cannot hunt in couples. They agree together much as
do flint and steel the result is sparks of discord.
Tasso can admire the secretary, just as Coleridge
admired men of business, for capacities wherein he felt
himself signally deficient: he calls his conversation
instructive, and his words 'how useful in a thousand
instances!'
For he possesses, I may truly say,
All that in me is wanting. But, alas!
When round his cradle all the gods assembled
To bring their gifts, the Graces were not there;
And he who lacks what these fair powers impart,
May much possess and much communicate,
'But on his bosom we can ne'er repose'--
any more than Shelley could have nestled in that of
Jeremy Bentham. Tasso tries to like him, but the two
can never be placed cordially en rapport; their con-
strained and evanescent alliance has no claim to a
section in Elective Affinities. The third scene of the
second act opens with an interchange of everything
that pretty is' between the poet and the politician, and
ends with poor Tasso in an attitude, flourishing his
sword, and trying to provoke his self-collected com-
panion to get up a sceno.' Alas for Tasso's sensations
when Alphonso enters, just in time to behold his martial
pose plastique! while Messer Antonio serenely says:
6
"
Calm and unmoved, oh prince, thou find'st me here
Before a man whom passion's rage hath scized.'
The consequence of the broil is brief confinement' for
the excited pocta sentence mildly passed by Alphonso,
but overfraught with shame and bitterness to the
subject of it, still writhing under the recollection of
Antonio's formal wisdom' and proud assumption of
magisterial superiority, which Tasso is not yet old or
wise enough to answer with a patient smile. Later
in the play, Leonora, anxious to heal the breach, assures
Tasso→→→
Yet often with respect he [Antonio] speaks of thee:'
whereto the fretting captive makes reply:
Thou meanest with forbearance, prudent, subtle.
'Tis that annoys me; for he knows to use
Language so smooth and so conditional,
That seeming praise from him is actual blame.'
The psychological truth involved in this state of mind
is developed with considerable power, and illustrates
Goethe's mastery of the heart of man. Tasso is the
'hero' of this drama de jure only, not de facto; now
and then our feeling towards him oscillates between
impatience and compassion. He is not to be measured
by the standard applicable to sound nerves and world-
hardened, world-bronzed constitutions. He is one of
those anomalies that abound in the domains of genius
-who are a law unto themselves-jealous over their
own insular rights-tempest-tossed by every aggression
ab extra-misapprehending well-intentioned vulgarians,
and by them also misapprehended - denouncing the
coldness and coarseness of society, but only to heap
coals of fire on their own head. In Goethe's Tasso'
we see a noble, tender, morbidly-susceptible man, whose
ill-guided subjectivity' implicates him in continual
bewilderment, creates for his annoyance a recurring
series of troubles, and reduces him to strange passes
and sorry degradation. We witness the incipient stages
of that mysterious madness, the real nature and extent
of which is still among the unsolved problems of bio-
graphy, the unsettled curiosities of literature. We
watch the progress of that unhappy love which, in the
words of Charles Knight, swayed his whole destiny,
and made him the wayward, restless, self-abandoned,
and most unhappy slave of presumptuous hopes, of
bitter regrets, of agonising remembrances, of super-
stitious paroxysms.'* We see the abrupt awakening
of his visionary spirit from the halcyon calm of dream-
land to the harsh realities of a world where dreaming
is illicit, and where dreamers are liable to be prose-
cuted as the law directs. Deficient the drama un-
doubtedly is in many important particulars, but the
character of Tasso is portrayed with a vigour, ani-
mation, and vraisemblance that deserve and will repay
study. As such we commend it to the reader; little
disposed as we are to call the old man of Weimar
our Magnus Apollo, or to understand the sanity of those
who would put him 'far north of Shakspeare's self-
that bright particular star which dwells apart from and
above the whole constellation of Germany's dramatie
genius.
THE NEW LAND SYSTEM.
Orn attention has been specially drawn to a work
entitled the Irish Land Question, in which it is alleged
that the author, Vincent Scully, Q. C., has at length
shewn the true principles on which the tenure of land
should be settled. We have read Mr Scully's produc-
tion, however, and it does not appear to our mind that
the author has at all set at rest this vexed question, but
rather mystified it by new and impracticable views.
What is the actual condition of land-tenure in Ire-
land? For some centuries past, and up to the present
time,' says Mr Scully, the great mass of those who till
the Irish soil have possessed no permanent interest in
its improvement; being mere yearly tenants, liable to be
dispossessed at any time upon receiving a short notice,
and therefore in a state of most absolute dependence
upon their landlords. And the great misfortune arising
from the existing law is, that it holds out no sufficient
encouragements to induce either the landlord or the
tenant to unite in converting this uncertain yearly
tenancy into a certain and permanent tenure, but, on
the contrary, creates some serious embarrassments
impeding such a conversion.' Are we to understand
from this explanation that there is a law in Ireland to
prevent landlords granting leases for a determinato
series of years? We do not believe that there is any
such legal restriction. The proprietor of an estate in
Ireland is as free to give a nineteen years' lease of one
of his farms as if the property lay in Scotland. Such
being the case, we cannot see that the alternative to an
uncertain and impoverishing yearly tenancy is to im-
part a proprietary or permanent interest in the soil.
If letting land from year to year be bad, as we know it
is, why, in the name of common sense, do not the Irish,
like the Scotch landlords, grant leases for a period of
years? After the repeated explanations that have
been offered on this subject, it is provoking to find that
Irish authors and lawyers are to all appearance as
ignorant of what can be done by properly - arranged
leases of land as if no such things existed. They just
see two ways of proceeding-the yearly tenancy system,
and the qualified or full proprietorship. Perceiving that
the renting of land from year to year, with the chance,
of continual ejection, ruins the productiveness of the
soil and leads to hopeless misery, they rush to the con-
clusion that the practice is to be got rid of only by
substituting some species of ownership,
Must we
repeat that there is a middle course, which has been
pursued with the greatest success in Scotland, and that
it would be at least worth while to try the same in Ire-
land before attempting to upset society by new projects?
Mr Scully's method of reform is amusing. His
plan is to encourage the creation, with the consent
of the owner, and by voluntary arrangement between
landlord and tenant, of a simple description of temure
or estate; which, without any injury or coercion to-

wards the owner, will secure to each occupier a per-
manent interest in his holding, and eventually identify
the actual occupation with the absolute ownership of
the soil. The state, the owner of the land, and the
occupying tenant, should each be a party to any volun-
tary arrangement by which all would be benefited
alike. Any new system should be as simple as may
be consistent with its possessing such peculiar advan-
tages, as will effectually induce its speedy adoption,
and tend to carry out its leading objects, of uniting
the ownership with the occupation of the land, and of
increasing its value by facilitating its future transfer.
To effect these objects, the state should enforce and

will be necessary that a land-tribunal shall be consti-

and future continuance."

But the Irish small farmer is oppressed. His land-
lord will not deal with him fairly. He will not give
him a lease, nor will he do anything for his lands. He
leaves the poor man to struggle on with an insecure
tenure, and turns him adrift when it suits his faney.
If all this be true, Irish landlords are demons, not men.
It is our impression that Irish proprietors, though mis-
taken in some things and reckless in others, are still
human beings, and governed by ordinary motives. We
do not believe that any landlord will do a cruel thing
merely for the wicked pleasure of doing it. It is more
very common reason given by Irish landlords for not
granting leases is, that were they to do so, the lands
would be sublet, and that instead of having one they
would have fifty tenants. They let a farm of a hundred
acres to one man under the strictest obligation not to
sublet it. No sooner, however, does the lessee enter into
possession than he sublets it, in whole or part, to twenty
tenants, giving each five acres; then these five-acre-
men sublet again in smaller portions; and before the
landlord has time to turn round he finds his lands
occupied by probably fifty families. Now if there be
the slightest foundation for representations of this kind,
it is evident that the state is powerless in providing a
remedy. The evil lies in the necessities and feelings of
the people. Suppose that Mr Scully's plan were carried
out of giving a permanent interest in a farm to one
tenant, the mischief would not be mended; for this
single tenant would speedily assume the position of a
middleman, and his subtenants would stand as much
in need of fixity of tenure as he did himself. In short,
unless the more substantial class of tenants in Ireland
engage to work out covenants to the letter, and care-
fully exclude squatters and subtenants, there can be
no hope of reform in land-tenure. On this point the
whole question hangs. In Scotland no such thing as
subtenanting is known or permitted. The tenant of a
farm under lease must walk into it himself, and him-
self alone. The instant he introduced a subtenant,
even for so much as a potato-garden, he would vitiate
his covenant, and would be requested to vacate. Fortu-
Anately, there is no Court of Chancery in Scotland to
interpose difficulties and heap up expenses, in the
event of any such difference arising between landlord
and tenant. The law is simple and of ready applica-
tion through the agency of effective local tribunals
In this exposition there appears to be a curious con-
fusion of ideas: the state is called upon to enforce and
sanction voluntary arrangements. If proprietors are
pleased to enter into bargains to sell lands to their
tenants, pray what hinders them from doing so in the
present state of things? But in this, as in many other
matters, the Irish mind looks to improved action only
through state interposition as if the people were chil-
dren, and could do nothing of their own accord. There is
to be a public land-tribunal-a precious job doubtless it
would be-which shall ascertain and fix the fair letting
value, or the net ammual rent which a solvent tenant
can afford to pay above all rates, taxes, and public
charges, including the entire poor-rates, quit-rent, and
tithe-rent-charge." The tenant is thus to have a per-
petual interest, so long as he may continue to pay
the rent agreed upon and fixed at its fair letting value.'
And if the tenant pleases, he is to be at liberty to buy
up his land by paying certain instalments of its value.
If he have not cash to do this, he is to be permitted to
borrow money on debentures; and, if need be, govern-
ment is to lend him what he requires!
Such is the sober proposal of a Queen's council to
settle the Irish Land Question. It is settling it with a
vengeance! The scheme is a regular confiscation.
set of penniless occupants are to be allowed to take
permanent possession of the lands on which they
happen to be planted, the proprietors, under a myste-
rious kind of voluntary compulsion, being treated as
nobodies in the transaction. It would
worth while to treat this modest propositiorcely be (sheriff-courts), and every facility is afforded for the
with any-
thing like seriousness, were it not unfortunately the
case that absurdities of this kind pass for sound
political economy among a certain class of minds.
Most strange is it that so acute a people as the Irish
should listen to such reveries; and it is to warn them
against these visionary ideas of social reform that we
venture an allusion to the subject. As plain-speak-
ing in matters of this sort is the most friendly, we
trust not to be misunderstood when we say that the
outery about tenant-right and fixity of tenure proceeds
on an erroneous conception of the relationship of land-
lord and tenant-that is, of mutual rights and obliga-
tions. We must, in particular, condemn the notion of
calling in the state to settle the terms on which land is
to be let or purchased. The state has nothing to do
with private interests. Every man is entitled to ask
what rent he likes for his land, or to demand what
price he pleases for any article he has for sale. And
on the same grounds, every man is entitled to refuse
taking lands or buying goods on the terms so proposed.
Freedom to let, freedom to sell; freedom to go, freedom
to come. Thorough liberty between man and man, to
deal or not to deal. These are the true economics at
which society has arrived; and we would as soon think
due execution of land-contracts. Provided, therefore,
that landlords and tenants do their duty, tenant-
right, as it is called, has no purpose or meaning. The
proprietor lets his lands for a series of years on
certain stipulated terms; the tenant accepts the lease
on these terms, and honestly works them out. What
more is wanted? Generally, in Scotland, the lease is
for nineteen years. At its commencement, the landlord
builds a farmhouse and offices, including a thrashing-mill,
moved by steam or water power, or puts those things
in repair if they already exist. He also encloses the
fields with fences and gates, and makes farm-roads. The
tenant has only to sit down comfortably in the dwelling
prepared for him, and to set to work boldly with his
capital to keep the land in condition, calculating that
what he expends will be amply repaid before the expiry
of his lease. When that period arrives, he either takes
a fresh lease on similar terms, or goes off in quest of
something more advantageous. The idea of pestering
the legislature to give him a permanent right to the
land he has tilled never enters his head: if it did, he
would only be laughed at by his more discerning
neighbours. Is there anything in the soil or atmos-
phere of Ireland that should dispose a tenant-farmer
to entertain notions which are scouted in other parts

die with decency, and by no means leave so unsavoury
a reputation behind as if it had been hurried out of

pleasant to part in so improved a spirit with a very
old and for very many years useful and respectable
acquaintance--so much so, indeed, as almost to reconcile
one to the very lingering and painful struggle which
has preceded the final exit.
----
Smithfield Market, for yet a little while, is one of the
great sights of the metropolis, than which none offers a
more vivid idea of the gigantic extent of the multitu-
dinous population whose myriad mouths require to be
alimented twice in each week with so prodigious an
amount of flesh, over and above the enormous quantities
of dead meat brought daily by rail from the provinces.
The cattle-market days are Monday and Friday-the
former being exclusively devoted to the sale of beasts,
calves, sheep, lambs, with usually not a very large con-
tingent of swine. Friday, in addition to all these-with
a strong preponderance in pigs-displays a goodly show
of donkeys, horses, vehicles, harness, whips, and other
agricultural adjuncts, and is altogether a much more
miscellaneous, noisy, and huckstering fellow than his
grave and respectable elder brother, Monday. Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday are hay and straw days,
whilst Wednesday is a dies non in the Smithfield
calendar.
Preparations for the Monday traffic commences in
Smithfield soon after ten o'clock on the Sabbath even-
ing. The holy day is then verging towards its close;
respectable citizens are either in bed or preparing to
retire thither; and the large expanse of Smithfield,
with its intricate tracery of sheep and swine pens,
cattle-rails, dimly visible in the light of the market
gas-lamps, aided here and there by the dubious flicker
of partially-closed taverns and gin-shops, is tenantless,
save for a few passengers hurrying east or west to
their homes before the brute-arrivals bar or encumber

Street to Smithfield Bars, or from that by Snow Hill
to the Three Foxes Court in Long Lane! We have
been told, upon very high authority, that there are not
more than two or three general officers in the British
service who would know how to get 40,000 disciplined
men in or out of Hyde Park. If this be so, either
regimental soldiers are less orderly and docile than
sheep and oxen, or the generals less masters of their
business than the Smithfield drovers; for you will pre-
sently see that numbers of animals march in, take up
their positions, and in due time march off again, with a
despatch, regularity, and order which, under the cir-
cumstances, must be considered perfectly admirable.
Now and then, to be sure, a silly sheep, at odds with
destiny, will bolt suddenly off with a dog at its heels ;
but whatever speed may be put forth, it finds, alas! no
egress from the perplexing maze of pens in which it is
involved; and very soon, in obedience to the cry of
Turn un--turn un,' is made to retrace its steps, and
rejoin its Norfolk or Southdown companions. Perhaps,
too, a recalcitrant calf, obstinately inimical to conversion
into veal, whilst gently led along by a halter, starts off
with the boy in charge, and is with some difficulty
restored to his place in quadrupedal juvenile society;
or it may be that a restive porker, here and there, with
the inveterate hoggish propensity by which he is dis-
tinguished of scampering off in precisely the opposite
direction to that which leads to where his presence is
most ardently desired, creates a momentary confusion;
but with these trifling exceptions the behaviour of the
animals, as far as my observation has gone, is gene-
rally unexceptionable. The larger and more valuable
ones especially permit themselves to be tied to the
rails without a murmur, except indeed an occasional

them emit the same sounds whilst revelling in Saintfoin

tion with the lower animals,' and it is therefore obvi-
ously impossible to say what the lowing of the ox, the
baaing of the sheep, the neighing of the horse, or the
braying of the ass, precisely indicate-albeit it must
be conceded that the squeaking of swine has a rather
exact significance. Nine-tenths of the noises, too, in
Smithfield are made by the calves a fact in natural
history which persons of experience in the world will
have no difficulty in believing.
coarse-grained, wiry-tempered old fellow, busy at the
moment in getting some refractory sheep into place
and order, and in so doing encountered a specimen of
sour-krout quite new to him. He wished to ascertain
where the man got his badge, and very civilly said:
'How you get, my goot friend, the arm- brass with
figures?' As he touched the article whilst speaking,
he was sufficiently comprehended, and the drover
merely squinting at the questioner from the corner of
his eyes, and without for an instant discontinuing his
operations with the sheep, answered quickly and
gruffly: 'Byes'em; ees a do byes'em!' The gentle-
man stretched his ears eagerly, but they conveyed no
intelligent sound to his brain. English of that kind
had never, he was sure, been taught in Faderland.
What you say, good man?' he anxiously replied―
'what you say?' The answer was this time unbroken
by a comma: Byes'em ees a do byes'em!'
querist was completely nonplussed; his reputation as a
linguist fell rapidly with his companions; and I has-
tened to remark that the gutturals he had just heard
was Smithfield for saying that the market authorities,
when granting the badge, charged the recipient a cer-
tain sum for it.
'Ding-dong!-ding-dong!' It is half-past ten o'clock
-the official hour for the admission of sheep is strik-
ing; and see, there glides in through Smithfield Bars
the first instalment for this night of the tide of animal
life constantly pouring from north, south, east, and west
of the United Kingdom; from France, Holland, Ger-
many, Spain, Italy, towards this great centre of carni-
vorous consumption. The permanent pens, each capable
of holding twelve sheep comfortably, but which upon
occasion accommodates sixteen or eighteen, fill rapidly
under the guidance of the drovers-men licensed by
the city authorities, and wearing a numbered brass-
badge on the left arm. These persons are employed
and paid by the salesmen-a highly-respectable body of
tradesmen, to whom the stock forwarded for sale in
Smithfield is chiefly consigned. The drovers are sent
out to meet the sheep or beasts expected by rail or
road; and as none but they are allowed to work in the
market, the disposal of the animals is managed with a
celerity and system which could not be attained if
strangers were permitted to bring in and arrange the
cattle. There are not many short of two thousand of
these drovers attached to Smithfield Market-rude,
coarse fellows no doubt, and in matters not pertaining
to their business ignorant enough, but in that exceed-ings.
ingly expert, and generally trustworthy. The 'regula-
tion' instrument of torture' which they use is not a
very formidable instrument, but a stick about the
thickness of a stout man's thumb, rather more than
four feet in length, with an iron point at one end pro-
jecting not more than a quarter of an inch. Neverthe-
less the innate savagery of some vicious natures is at
no loss for means of cruelty, and the vigilance of the
police-officers is especially directed to the prevention or
chastisement of acts of brutality. The last morning I
visited the market I observed to one of the officers-a
civil and intelligent Scotsman, by the way-that I had
been looking on for five or six hours, and as yet had seen
nothing of the outrageous cruelty said to be so preva-
lent there. "I should hope not,' he replied with a
laugh. A good deal of that is mere stuff and non-
sense, though of course cattle can't be got to their
places and haltered as gently and tenderly as babies
are put to bed. Not but what the drovers require
sharp looking after. This very morning we dropped
down upon two of them before it was light, and locked
them up for what we deemed cruelty.'
There can be no doubt that the greatly-improved
aspect of Smithfield is in a great degree due to the
vigilance of the now admirably-organised police-force
a body of men not only highly efficient in their
Vocation, but extremely serviceable just now as
interpreters of the mysteries of the market to the
numerous foreigners-Germans principally-I have
noticed, who visit this metropolitan lion at about
sunrise. The astonishment of these gentlemen as
the vast droves pour in hour after hour is often very
vehemently expressed, especially after hearing from
an officer the number that will probably arrive:
'What you say? Forty, feefty tousend! Mein Gatt!
And you shall throw a stone over the place!' They
are not so fortunate when driven to drovers for infor-
mation. One rather ludicrous instance I myself
noticed. A gentleman, one of a party of five, and
their interpreter, flushed with the flying colours with
which he had come off in his colloquy with a polite
police-officer, must needs venture his English with a
The
But to resume the progress of the market. The
hour-and-a-half's monopoly enjoyed by the sheep has
sufficed to about one-third fill the pens; and now, twelve
o'clock having struck, on come the dense, bellowing
herds of oxen-stirks, stots, heifers, cows; short horns,
straight horns, crescent horns, long horns, no horns;
black, white, pied, dun, red; on come the huge beasts,
and as they arrive are with surprising dexterity and
dispatch securely fastened to the strong market rail-
From this hour, midnight, till seven or eight in
the morning, the living stream of beasts and sheep,
and calves and pigs, gradually attenuating of course,
and with widening intervals, will pour on. Those who,
on a fine summer morning, have watched at an early
hour any of the great roads leading into London,
will agree that the sudden and repeated appearance of
the droves or flocks at the brow of an eminence, or
at a turn in the long, silent vista, bringing, as it were,
the light with them, presents a panorama of the liveliest
and most pleasing kind. It is not till about half-past
five or six o'clock that the swine make their entrance
into the market, and at about the same time numerous
carts and small wagons arrive-two-storeyed for the
occasion, or having a kind of basket or cage nearly the
size of the floor of the vehicle, swinging under it be-
tween the wheels, and vocal, like the upper apartment,
with the bleatings and baaings of calves and sheep.
These conveyances are frequently driven by the pro-
prietor of the animals himself; and just now he is
pretty sure to be accompanied on the fore-seat of the
machine by his wife or daughter, perhaps both, come up
of course to see the Great Exhibition.
By this time-half-past five-the market will have
assumed a very busy aspect, and if the morning be
fine, will present a gay and animated scene. The
salesmen, with their ink-bottles hanging down in front
of their waistcoats, are at their posts; but if you are to
believe the abstracted, indifferent expression of their
faces when buyers approach, without wish, much less
anxiety, to sell. It is clearly their opinion that pur-
chasers on this particular day ought to esteem them-
selves fortunate in being supplied at almost any price
the supply, as they say, being so inadequate to the
tremendous demand. The buyers, of whom there are
probably already several hundreds in the field-many
of them in blue aprons, and almost all with a pair of
bright scissors peeping out of their breast or waistcoat-
pockets-it is equally clear, from the same index-tablet,
are merely present as spectators, and with no purpose
whatever of purchasing, unless the prices are very low
indeed. One has just told the stout, jolly-looking sales-
man yonder that he is not particularly in want of veal:

returns and again examines the animals, just as he
says to find out what on earth there can be about
them to warrant the demand of such a preposterous
price, and finally makes an offer. The salesman's 'No'
is quick and emphatic; another bid is made, the sales-
man relaxes somewhat in both figure and face, and
ultimately the buyer-the more quickly should another
be handling the calves-extends his right hand, opens
it, and presents it to the salesman, at the same time
naming his last offer. The salesman ponders for an
instant, recognises that it is the purchaser's final word,
strikes his own palm into the other's, and it is a con-
cluded irrevocable bargain by custom of the market.
The salesman's account-book and the buyer's scissors
are out and open the next moment: the purchaser's
name and the price he is to pay are down in black and
white, and his initials or some other peculiar mark are
cut on the hair of the hind-quarter of the calves.
Hundreds upon hundreds of such bargains are effected
long before the mass of Londoners, whose appetites are

the buyer consists chiefly in his being able to guess
correctly at the weight of the animal, which it is said
many of them can do within a stone even of the largest
beasts. The reports of the newspapers that beef and
mutton fetched so much per stone, sinking the offal,
pork so much per score, record merely guess-prices;
neither beasts, sheep, nor swine being actually sold by
weight. The instant a bullock or cow is purchased, the
hair of the animal's tail is cut off; if otherwise, a few
of the hairs are pulled out and tied round the tail.
These are signs to purchasers that the animals are
disposed of, and prevents their being unnecessarily
handled, or business - men from wasting their time
unnecessarily in contemplation of their beauties.
Sheep, the instant two hands have struck a bargain
over them, are ruddled with the buyer's mark.
One peculiarity of this market is, that the salesman

banks, and into one of these the amount agreed upon
is paid; and when the seller has ascertained that this
is done, the animals are delivered and driven off.
This custom is said to have originated in a desire to
protect the distant proprietor of stock from being de-
frauded of any portion of the price realised; but the
real purpose appears to be the prevention of frauds
on the city-tolls, which are, on all sheep sold, 2d. per
score, and on all beasts, Is. Sd. per score.
The time for closing the market on Mondays is
twelve o'clock, after which carts, wagons, and other
vehicles may pass through; but it is usually two or
three hours later before business is entirely over, and
the unsold stock-seldom a large quantity-drawn off
to the neighbouring lairs, there to remain till the next
market-day. Swine especially, which arrive later than
sheep and oxen, may be seen in every gradation of
porcine existence, from the huge bacon hog to the
milk-fed innocent whose roasted succulence has been so
unctuously celebrated by Charles Lamb, panting in their
exposed pens beneath the rays of the noontide sun, in
scarcely-diminished numbers. The donkey and horse
market is on Friday only: the first come early, but
the "'osses,' which are 'strawed'-that is, which have a
bunch of straw tied to their manes and tails as a token
that the proprietor is open to a reasonable offer-do
not arrive till two o'clock, by which time the demand
for beef and mutton is supposed to be over. The din
and hubbub at about the time of the horse-market,
caused by the shouts and cries of ginger-beer, oyster,
whip, and other vendors of miscellaneous products
-the Hi! hi!' of the donkey-dealer whilst exhi-
biting the merits of his animals-the cracking of
whips and trotting of horses up and down-must be
heard to be fully appreciated; constituting, as they do,
a deafening uproar and tumult, compared with which
the noise and rattle of Fleet Street at its busiest hour
of the day sinks into insignificance. There are, of course,
horses of every degree of value sold in Smithfield, and
bargains may doubtless be picked up there occasionally;
but it is not a place in which an amateur in horse-flesh
should try his 'prentice-hand at purchasing. If there
is one thing that cannot be successfully assumed, it is
that of being a judge of horse qualities in the presence
of a Smithfield dealer. However wisely and cautiously
you may utter sententious depreciations of the animal
after, as you think, the exact manner of the really
knowing ones, he will detect with unerring sagacity
the innocence of your heart in your speech or look;
the price will be adjusted to your capacity with mar-
vellous readiness; and you may fully depend that
when the bargain is struck, another guess-sort-of-animal
than the horse you have purchased has been sold. If
you doubt the truth of this, make the experiment: once
will quite suffice."
In this brief sketch of the great London cattle-
market, many incidents and peculiarities which give it
life and colour must necessarily be omitted; but the
temporary visitor to the metropolis may rest assured
that a visit to these scenes, soon to become matters of
history only, will be amply repaid by what he will
witness there. In conclusion, we may remark, that

extent withdrawn. It may affright the human imagi-
nation to picture to itself wretched, tortured animals
battered to death amidst filth and darkness; but to the
poor beast itself it is the same thing whether the blows
be dealt in a dark cellar or in an open, freely-ventilated
abattoir. It is a detestable cruelty wherever com-
mitted; and especially now-when, by the discovery of
chloroform, science has afforded an agent by means of
which the necessary taking away of animal life can be
effected without the infliction of pain-such a brutal
mode ought not to be persisted in. Many practical'
eyebrows will doubtless be elevated at the suggestion.

of the Regium Donum Fund of L.30,000 a year, closeted
with Irish secretaries, controlling Irish estimates, and
despatched to London when the Irish government
wanted a useful witness' to stop the mouth of a
troublesome committee.
Such splendid success could scarcely fail to provoke
some little envy. The Irish government were duly
informed of the Highland antecedents of their fortu-
nate friend, and were particularly requested to see that
his accounts were properly vouched and audited. The
hint was taken-a board of inquiry was appointed by
Earl de Grey, the viceroy of the day; but that board
ulti-reported that Duncan Chisholm, alias George Mathews,
'was a public servant of unimpeachable integrity;'
and Under-Secretary Lucas was instructed to convey
to the much-maligned gentleman the lord-lieutenant's
opinion that he had been completely and honourably
acquitted of every charge affecting his character.'
This was in the spring of 1842. An acquittal so cm-
phatic seems to have silenced complaint if it did not
remove suspicion; and it is not until after seven
years have passed that the attention of the Irish
government is again drawn by Mr Sadleir, the member
for Carlow, to the proceedings of Mr Chisholm or
Mathews. Mr Sadleir's letter goes over the old field,
and breaks some new ground; but Lord Clarendon
sees nothing in the statement to shake his full confi-
dence in the verdict of 1842, and pronounces, there-
fore, that any new inquiry would be unfair towards
Mr Mathews, and is uncalled for on any public ground.'
Mr Sadleir returns to the charge, which he enforces by
at least one strong piece of evidence; but still Lord
Clarendon will not be moved, and the member for Car-
low then retires discomfited from the lists.
STORY OF DUNCAN CHISHOLM.
SOME recent parliamentary papers embody the story of
a remarkable adept at deception, and so useful is the
moral that may be drawn from the perusal of this
half-droll, half-melancholy case, that we depart from
our ordinary custom in not noticing matters of state
concern. We present the story pretty much as it has
been ably condensed from the original 'blue-book' by a
clever northern newspaper.*
Those who were familiar with the pretty little town
of Inverness five-and-twenty, or, it may be, thirty
years ago, must remember the hero of this story.
Duncan Chisholm, says our parliamentary authority,
seemed at that time to be about thirty years of age.
He was somewhat slender in person; his stature was
of the middle size-or, to be more specific, he stood
about five-feet-nine in his boots; his shoulders were
high, his complexion sallow; and it was particularly
remarked that he seldom looked any one in the face.
For his dress, he affected a blue surtout, a black
waistcoat, pantaloons, and a hat. He united the some-
what incongruous vocations of a solicitor and dealer in
leather. Between these two professions it was fated
that Duncan Chisholm should fall to the ground: in
plain terms, he found his way into the list of seques-
trations' in the Gazette. On becoming bankrupt, he
clandestinely left Inverness, and could not be found,
although a reward of fifty guineas was offered for his
apprehension,
Years rolled by, but no tidings were heard of the
vanished solicitor. By many he was believed to have
been long dead and buried, when suddenly a rumour
reached Inverness that, he was yet alive and well.
Many and stiff were the tumblers of toddy that were
drunk that night in the capital of the Highlands, in
discussing the credibility of a report which affirmed
that the broken-down leather-seller of Clach-na-cuddin
was now, under another name, a man of fortune, high
in office in Dublin Castle, a dispenser of magnificent
charities, the counsellor of statesmen, the instructor of
parliaments. Even so it was: when closely questioned,
Mr George Mathews of the secretary's office in Ireland
confessed his identity with Duncan Chisholm, the man
of law and leather in Inverness; and seeing that better
could not be, he told the story of his transformation.
Enlisting in the 53d regiment of foot, he rose to be a
sergeant. He was reduced from that grade after a few
months, only to rise again to a higher rank-that of
staff-military-clerk in the brigade office at Dublin.
Hence, about 1833, he made his way as a clerk into
the Irish Tithe Office, Five years afterwards he was
appointed secretary of the Tithe Million Fund, with a
salary of ten pounds a week, besides his pay as a clerk
in the Irish secretary's office. His ascent was now
rapid: another year or two saw him in the management
* Edinburgh Evening Courant,,
But Duncan Chisholm had made to himself enemies
more implacable than any political adversary. By the
patronage which he lavished on the small religious sect
of whose tabernacle he was a pillar, he had roused the
hatred of some other sects of nearly the same persua-
sion. When once thoroughly excited, the odium theolo-
gicum never dies, never tires, never relents. The detec-
tion which had baffled successive viceroys, secretaries,
and statesmen, was at length accomplished by the
persevering enmity-the patient watch and vigil
long-of two or three dissenting ministers who dif-
fered from Mr Duncan Chisholm on certain recondite
points of doctrine. The charges against him were once
more renewed another commission of inquiry was
appointed; but before it could begin its labours the
accused had admitted his guilt by an ignominious
flight. The whole mystery was now at an end, and the
twelve years' official career of this man, for whose
unimpeachable integrity' two lords-lieutenants had
stood willing sponsors, was proved to have been one
continued tissue of crime and imposture. The amount
of public money which he had plundered by fraud and
forgery does not exactly appear, but it must have been
large-and the daring way in which he effected his pil-
lage is not a little remarkable.

--
We have said that he was a shining light in a petty
religious body. This was a sect describing itself as
Trinitarian Presbyterians, holding what are theologi-
cally called non-subscribing principles-that is, rejecting
subscription to any creed, confession, catechism, or other
formulary as a test or condition of admission into the
ministerial office.' This denomination, consisting only of
a few scanty congregations, seems early to have presented
itself to Chisholm as a convenient means for carrying
on his robbery of the public, while he gratified at the
same time his love of sanctimonious display. In
the end of the year 1839, by one stroke of his pen
he called into being three missionaries of his sect
labouring in the south of Ireland; while, by another
stroke of the same ingenious instrument, he conferred
on these aerial preachers the substantial benefit of a
stipend of about L.100 a year. The stipend was voted

Such a work is now before us;* but, independently
of the leading thought, it possesses considerable literary
merit, and, above all, evinces, on the part of the author,
a practical acquaintance with society, and the power
of reading the human heart through the incrustations
of conventionalism. This knowledge the fair writer has
repeatedly used for the benefit of our own readers;

middle classes of this country-those, more especially,
who live in the more distinguished kind of country-

by parliament, and paid by the Irish government; but
as the missionaries never had any existence except in
the teeming brain of the Highland leather-seller, the
reader will scarcely need to be informed into whose
purse the stipend went. What Sydney Smith somewhat
profanely fancied of the sideboard of a New Zealand
bishop might be truly and literally affirmed of the table
of Mr Duncan Chisholm. He found missionaries to be
indeed meat and drink to him-pocketing on this head
alone, it would seem, somewhere about L.500. Em-

How the grant was spent is not clearly ascertained,
but of course the inventor had his due share. One

We cannot accompany the parliamentary paper any
farther in its exposure of the profligacy of this enor-
mous rogue-his personation of dead men, his personi-
fication of men who never lived, his foisting his own
relatives into the pension-list, his defrauding the deserv-
ing poor of their little pittances, his placing on one
charitable fund 'no less than thirty-two persons, all of
whom, with a few exceptions, are or were members of
the congregation of his own presbytery.' Imperfect as
is the outline which we have sketched, it may serve at
least to point the twofold moral of this extraordinary
history-to shew, in the first place, the fatal facility
with which the cloak of religious pretension can be
assumed as a screen for the vilest rascality; and to
demonstrate, in the second place, the necessity for an
instant and thorough purgation of the subordinate
offices of Dublin Castle. That such a monstrous and
impudent system of deception as that daily practised
by Duncan Chisholm should have escaped detection for
more than a dozen years is a disgrace to the execu-
tive, and may be said to shake confidence in that very
self-sufficient thing, the whole red-tapist system!
A NOVEL OF THE SEASON.
AMONG the works of this class that at certain seasons
of the year pour in a continuous stream from the press,
there are only a few of any mark or likelihood. Occa-
sionally, however, it happens that there is one distin-
guished from the rest by some beam of thought, some
touch of originality, which sets the reader to dream
and to meditate, and which, even in the midst of the
perusal of more brilliant, and, it may be, more talented
works, retains a sort of magical influence over his mind.
A book of this kind is termed 'suggestive,' because
it supplies the momentum which turns the winged
thoughts loose in some prescribed career-when the
idea of the author being carried along, as it were, with
our own, becomes interwoven in the web of our fancies
and reflections.
'Our readers have probably seen those singular-look-
ing defences on the coast, now used as stations for the
preventive-service sailors; but possibly some may not be
aware, that at the close of the war they were inhabited
by the officers of the coast-guard, and occasionally by
their families: better and more commodious dwellings
have been since then erected for them, one of which,

only two rooms, each in the form of a quadrant; the

was almost impossible to see, even in the room blessed
with a loophole; but by degrees, as the eye became
accustomed to the obscurity, objects grew more distinct,
and the few people who visited Nevil's quarters were
then made aware that woman's taste and ingenuity
had given the dark, small apartment an air of comfort,
and almost elegance. The carpet was bright-coloured,
adapted to catch every scanty gleam of light that visited
it; the chairs were of fanciful and pretty shapes. Close
to the loophole was a couch covered with a brilliant
chintz, on which lay two or three snowy pillows edged
with lace, and a little coverlet, shewing that it was the
spot dedicated to the baby's day repose. A harp stood
in the sharp corner of the quadrangle. There were
book-shelves well filled; and on the table in the centre a
vase of beautiful flowers, a lady's work-basket, writing-
materials, &c.
"There were also signs of Mr Nevil's participation in
the occupancy of the room-a sword and pistols on the
side-table, a small gold compass, and some other nautical
instruments. It was wonderfully neat and comfortable
for such a place; but light was wanting; and what can
compensate for the deprivation of that first gift of the
Creator to the universe?'

Dolores is born in a pleasanter home than this; but
the murder of her father throws a shade upon the
spirits of the family; and after this is dispelled by
time, the marriage of her aunt, and other family cala-
mities for this was indeed one-breaks up the circle.
"Mamma," said Dolores, as that evening they sat in the
dim fire-light alone, "I wonder people think a wedding
a happy event! Aunt Katie's was quite a break-up to
all our merriment. How we used to laugh in the fire-
light, and now we are so grave and quiet! Everything
and everybody changed by it: Grandpapa is quite
cross when he talks of it, though he wished my aunt to
marry; grandmamma looks older and sadder ever
since; Mr Marsh is grown dull; you have no con-
fidente now but your poor Dolores; and dear Flossy
has never been well from that time. All this discom-
fort comes from what people call a “happy event."
astonished; but her perplexity reaches its height upon
a conversation held between them at a time of family
calamity and excitement which has drawn them into
confidential familiarity. The occasion is the elopement
of Aunt Katie's unworthy husband.
'Dolores stole softly to his side, and for a few instants
neither spoke. There was something solemn and
silencing in the scene before them: the quiet expanse of
mighty tranquil waters; the dark sky, with its myriads
of cold, bright stars; and the hymn, meant to be trium-
phant, but which had nevertheless a strain of mourn-
fulness in its quaint melody. At last the voices died
away, and Livingstone turned towards her: she could
not see the expression of his face, but she fancied that
he was agitated, and she hastened to deliver her mes-
sage, adding, as she ended it: "This is a sad Christmas-
eve, Mr Livingstone. I wonder if through all England
there is any one at this moment more miserable than
poor Aunt Catherine.”
66
'She was startled by his catching her hand and ex-
claiming vehemently: Yes, Dora, I am!"
"You, Mr Livingstone?"
Ay; a curse has followed me from my birth, and
will rest on me till those quiet stars shall shine upon
my grave!"
"A curse!"
"Ay; one that I must keep hidden within my own
soul-one that cannot be alleviated by sympathy! If
I were to tell it to you-even you, tender and truthful
as your spirit is, would shrink from me in fear and
horror!"
"Surely no! I never could feel fear or horror of
you."
"You could-you would! But this is not a time to
harass you with a new tale of the wo this wretched
earth bears upon its bosom. Good-night, Dora! When
you pray for yourself and Catherine, pray also for
Walter Livingstone."
This Dolores was somewhat plain in her person; but
'her intellect was, literally speaking, beautiful. She
was highly imaginative, but had a sufficient sense of
the ludicrous to prevent the romance of her character
ever betraying her into absurdity. Without being the
least sentimental or "missy" in manner, her poetical
taste infused a certain sentiment into the actions of her
every-day life. She was perhaps too grave and thought-
ful for her age; but that might be accounted for by
the deep sorrow in which her infancy had been cherished
--by the tears that had often steeped her infant pillow.
If, however, she laughed less than Flora did, she was
more frequently the cause of laughter in others by her
quaint sayings and wild fancies, by her pretty half-real,
half-playful superstitions, and by the originality of her
humour, which nevertheless tended less to mirth than
to melancholy. She was so warm-hearted that it was
impossible not to love her; yet few entirely appreciated
her. Mrs Nevil was well educated and sensible, but
the mind of her daughter was beyond the comprehen-
sion or sympathy of her own; and when Dolores ven-
tured to reveal her fresh, original, and sometimes erring 'He grasped her hand in his, and pressed it earnestly

her own thoughts than is perhaps good for any one.
Her opinions and fancies, cherished in silence, and
never combated by those of others, grew strong and
obstinate, and but for a natural tenderness of disposi-
tion would have given her an unfeminine degree of
self-reliance. As it was, she had great confidence in
herself: there was nothing Dolores would not have
fearlessly attempted; and this dauntless reliance on her
own powers frequently insured her success. She liked
overcoming difficulties, or trying to overcome them;
and the mental toil and self-development in which she
was continually engaged took all weariness from her
quiet mode of life, and rendered her as unsusceptible of
girlish day-dreams of love and lovers as Shakspeare's
"Fair vestal throned by the west."
The interest of the young lady is excited by a very
tall and well-looking young man, with a deep, rich
voice, and that expression of melancholy which is com-
monly said to be so interesting to the softer sex.
Walter Livingstone has all the advantages of person
and fortune which form what is called in the world a
good match; but although sufficiently partial to female
society, and to that of Dolores in particular, he appears
to have no thought of marrying. He hovers, however,
round the poor girl; and without any idea of even
trifling with her, engages her in correspondence, and
yields as if by fatuity to a fascination which can have
no result but disappointment and misery. Dolores is
beyond the timid and tearful "Good-night," with which,
after an instant's pause, she left him.'
The ponderings of Dolores upon this singular text-
the hold taken of her heart by the image of her
unhappy friend-the longing that arose within her to
soothe and comfort him-all may readily be conceived,
for they belong to the ordinary routine of a generous
womanly passion. We cannot follow the story, how-
ever, even sufficiently to break the wildness of the
conception; but Walter Livingstone is insane, and
knows that he is so! It would have been well for
him if his illusions, which were of a harmless and
poetical kind, had extended throughout his whole life;
but unfortunately they occurred only at rare intervals,
and in the whole lucid space between he had the
horrible conviction that he was a madman.
Another lover appears upon the scene-the cousin of
Livingstone; and in him the family disease assumes a
new form, and receives another name. The one has an
unsound mind, and the other a depraved heart; and
in the contrast between the insanity of the intellect
and that of the affections lies the philosophy of the
work. Livingstone is stripped of his property, and
goaded into accesses of the malady by his cousin ;
and this gives rise to the exhibition of feminine devo-
tion in a strange and original form. Dolores, who has
become, by the accidents of life, a wealthy heiress,
receives her insane lover into her house, and nurses
him as a mother nurses her sick child. He is legally

forced, however, from her protection, and immured in
a madhouse; from which eventually he makes his
escape: whereupon she determines, if there should
prove to be no other means of accomplishing her pur-
pose, to give herself a legal claim to the guardianship
by marrying him! Having helped him on thus far, let
the reader pursue the story for himself.
·
It would be unfair to conclude without adding that,
amid all its serious purpose, there is a good deal of
amusement in the book. The half-witted major, who
is in love with Dolores in the days of her poverty, is
sketched with great spirit; and the mode he at last
hits upon of making her an offer of his hand, after
gazing, and laughing, and asking questions, and saying
it does not signify' through half a volume, is very
ingenious. "The place was accordingly hired, and the
day fixed for their departure from London. Major
Simpson was much distressed on learning their inten-
tion: he called every morning, asked Dolores "Where
she liked best to live?" and answered her reply inva-
riably by the observation, "that it did not signify!"
She grew quite used to this daily interrogatory, and at
last scarcely heeded it; but the day before they left
town a more decisive proof of his interest was vouch-
safed her. He came earlier than usual, and, after
talking for some little time in a nervous and less con-
nected manner than was his wont, drew from his
pocket a very splendid filigree card-case, and asked
Dolores to look at it. She examined and admired it.
"Oh, but open it-pray open it, and look at the
cards, Miss Nevil."
She complied, and read "Mrs Simpson," engraved
on their smooth surface. Rather puzzled, she looked
up inquiringly at her companion: he coloured a good
deal, laughed sheepishly, and asked: “Do you like it—
ch! eh?"
"Yes; it is a very pretty case, and the cards are
very nice."
"Eh-yes-I should say! very nice, eh! It looks
well-Mrs Simpson-ch?" And drawing out a card,
he examined it as if it were some rare work of art,
ending his inspection by the nervous laugh he always
found difficult to stop, and in which, in spite of all her
efforts to be grave, Dolores now joined.'
"Very good," he said at last; "very good-capital,
isn't it? Quite my own idea: nobody ever thought of
that before, ch-ch?"
"Of what?" asked Dora greatly mystified.
"Why-ch! to be sure, you understand? You'll
keep the card-case: it is for you!" And, charmed at
his own sagacity in this ingenious mode of proposing,
he gave way to another extraordinary burst of
laughter.'
SECRET OF TAMING ANIMALS.
We have no direct means of divining the why and
because' of certain predilections and prejudices observable
in birds and other animals. We daily see actions among
them for which we cannot in any way account. Thus, for
instance, if a dog enter a room full of company, you shall
presently observe him make a careful tour of the apartment,
sniffing first at one and then at another of the assembled
guests. Towards some his tail will be seen to wag with
every symptom of kindliness and good-will; whilst to-
wards others he will, with tail deflected, shew unmistak-
able signs of suspicion, perhaps of disgust. Depend upon
it the animal's discernment is rarely at fault. I would
willingly be guided by such a Mentor. Just so is it with
the feathered race. Some masters and mistresses can
never tame their birds: never get them to be on terms of
intimacy. The cause is evident. There are no feelings
of affection in common between them. They do not love
their birds. The latter know as much, and are assuredly
aware that they are kept simply for the sake of furnishing
amusement. I have noted the same unerring sagacity
with all my squirrels. They would constantly detect any
person who might be preparing or wishing to play them
off some practical joke, and would, to my great delight,
fasten on them at once-paying handsomely and in full
for all favours about to be' received. It was, however,
impossible for me to anger them. They too well knew
the friendliness of my disposition-seeing what merry
romps and gambols we had together, both by day and
night, up-stairs, down-stairs, and in the garden. No
doubt it is a wise provision of Nature thus to endow our
little friends with instinctive powers of perception. The
face is the index of the mind. They read our character
when they catch our eye.-William Kidd, in the Gar-
deners' Chronicle.

POOR ?-* * * * Admit that here and there a poor person has a

'I will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation.'
Leviticus, xxvi. 31.
I TROD the hallowed ground that bore
A Christian temple tall and proud,
When at each wide and lofty door
Went streaming in a gorgeous crowd:
A welcome day bid all rejoice-
A fair and ancient festival,
And the glad organ's mighty voice
Shook the strong roof and Gothic wall.
Full many a token marked the fold
Where rich and high believers meet,
The sacred volume clasped in gold,
The costly robe, and drowsy seat:
Priest, people, altar, chancel, choir,
Arch, column, window, porch, and gate-
That ample fane, from vault to spire,
Looked solemn all and calmly great.
But mark! An old and weary man,
A stranger clad in raiment vile,'
With failing steps and features wan,
Went tottering up the fair broad aisle:
They cast him out; oh, faithless race!
On some rude bench-unseen-remote;
Convicted in that hour and place
Of a lean purse and threadbare coat!
Yes! and if He, who saved the lost,
Stood fainting on that haughty floor,
Arrayed in weeds of little cost,
Meck as He sought our world before;
In spite of words which none might blame,
And works of goodness freely done,
That sordid post of wrong and shame
Would greet-JEHOVAH'S ONLY SON.
Oh for a prophet's tongue or pen
To warn the great in wealth and birth,
Who build their God a house, and then
Plant there the meanest pomps of earth:
To brand that church which spurns the poor
From every vain and venal pew,
Where clothed in purple' herd secure
To kneel or sleep-the lordly few!
Give me the shed, low, bare, and plain,
Where love and humble truth abide,
Rather than earth's most noble fane,

juvenile tongue; and we are told that 'money is the
representative of purchasable commodities' with some
air of scorn at the ignorance betrayed in the inquiry.
But the definition serves no practical purpose. It is
lost sight of the very next time we use the word; and
if we only seize our thought as it passes, we shall find
that 'money' stands for nothing but itself. To prove
this, let us suppose it to be actually the things it
represents; that instead of a well-filled purse, or a
THE MYSTERY OF MONEY.
'HANG them!" said Reynard, turning away from the
tempting bunch that looked down upon him with its
calm and juicy smile from a height just beyond his
reach-‘hang them!' said he, 'they are as sour as
crabs!' The story is somewhat musty, but wondrously
true. Even so do we of the human race console our-
selves for our deprivations by disparaging that which
we cannot obtain. Riches, fashion, power, dignity-coffer of coin, or a current account in the bank, we are
every unreached goal of desire, every unslaked thirst
of the soul, becomes an object of contempt or denun-
ciation; and a large majority of the world pass much
time in sneering at the aims and aspirations which are
the very life of their lives.
Take money as an illustration. To judge by the
terms in which it is spoken of, you would suppose its
possessors to be the most unlucky of mankind. Few
poor persons can find any better words for it than dross
or trash; the devotee denounces it as the accursed
thing; and the moralist discovers it to be the root of
all evil. Nay, the hatred and contempt with which it
inspires those who are baffled in its pursuit, extend not
unfrequently to the individuals who have gained that
deadly loss; and the rich, instead of being pitied, are
abused for their misfortune! But, setting aside the
inconsistencies of men, there is something peculiarly
mystical in the word Money, which appears to have
been disconnected by time and use from the idea it
originally represented, and to have become in itself a
substantive thing. It calls up no distinct images before
the mind; it does not even resemble a pagan god, whose
name is suggestive of his attributes-
'And thus from Jupiter whate'er is great
Proceeds; from Venus everything that's fair.'
It is rather the superstition than the idol; it is more a
feeling than an object; and the larger the sum we
contemplate in our thoughts, the more vague and shape-
less is the impression we receive.
Money suggests no ideas of grandeur, luxury, or
beneficence. Its possessor may be a plain man, of
simple tastes and retiring habits; he may be selfish
and ungenial; his enjoyment may consist in amassing
treasure, in knowing himself to be rich, and in feeling
that others know it; or his propensities may be
secretive, leading him to hoard and hide, to feign
poverty, to steal through the world as an object of
compassion, to live in destitution, and die a wealthy
beggar. From the word we receive no hint of any-
thing of this. It determines no position, no character;
we only know the man has money-What is money?
The answer is easy: it comes glibly off the most
surrounded by every article of necessity, comfort, or
luxury within our pecuniary means.
Let us suppose
that with the same case and directness with which we
put our hand in our pocket we stretch it forth and
grasp the objects it is our purpose to buy-whether
houses, lands, raiment, food, or anything else: let us
do this, and we shall fin! what a marvellous effect the
mere substitution of the thing for the word will have
upon our views, sentiments, and actions.
The rich man who lives in voluntary destitution we
designate by the Latin word miser, which means a
wretched, pitiful, abject fellow; but if we change the
money he hoards into the things it represents, we shall
find quite another name for him. This man possesses
an elegant house sumptuously furnished, its doors open
for his reception, and breathing forth an inviting atmos-
phere of warmth and comfort; but he shuts both doors
and windows, allows the house to stand unoccupied, and
burrows shivering in a cold and filthy cabin by its side.
He is hungry in this dark and miserable den; and
straightway a table is before him, furnished with steam-
ing dishes of exquisite meats, and lighted with per-
fumed wax. But he looks on-longing, yet unmoved.
The dainties he will neither touch himself nor allow
others to touch; and he satisfies his appetite as well
as he may with such scraps as a beggar would look
at with suspicion. After his meal he must go forth
upon his affairs; and there are lying before him for
his choice clean and comfortable or handsome and
fashionable clothes of all kinds; but choosing instead
some old and filthy rags, he sneaks into the street, an
object of mingled pity and disgust. This self-denial is
based upon no religious asceticism: his sole motive is
the dread of diminishing by use some mystical value
he imagines to reside in the articles in question. He is,
in short, a maniac.
In a former number of this Journal there was an
account-only too true, we are informed-of a man in
moderate circumstances, of ordinary intelligence, and
some accomplishments, whose attachment to money
was so great that he allowed his son to perish of
disease before his eyes rather than be at the expense
of medical aid. A man like this is commonly termed

'an unnatural parent;' but if we substitute for the
money the aid and medicine it would buy, we form
quite a different estimate of his conduct. The youth
gets worse and worse; his sickly appetite turns with
loathing from the ordinary food of the family; and as
his father opens a cupboard near him, his hollow eyes
are fixed eagerly on a heap of fruits and other delicacies
it contains. But the father looks unmoved on the
wasted face before him, and locks the cupboard. The
Oh for skill to investigate his
patient gets still worse.
complaint!-oh for medicine to heal and comfort-to
cool his parched tongue-
'To draw around his aching breast the curtains of
repose!'
Medical men stand close by, but no summons is heard
from the father's lips: the table is loaded with the
necessary medicine, but the father looks at the sinking
boy, and stirs not hand nor foot. A draught-one
draught would yet have a chance of saving him.
There: the phial labelled; a glass stands near
quick, quick! The father folds his arms, looks on as
before, and the son dies. What manner of man is
this? Still an unnatural parent? He is a murderer.
In the opposite vice of extravagance the word plays
the very same part. We give away money without
knowing what we give. Under that name we throw
about food and dresses by armfuls: we scatter bags of
corn and sacks of wheat upon the wind, and shovel
away whole acres of land for a pastime. We exchange
for a worthless gewgaw what appears to us to be
pieces of gold; but they are in reality a pile of loaves
sufficient to feed hundreds of human beings. If we
would only think what money really is when we give
it away! If we would only think what it is we with-
hold when we refuse it!
This unaccountable disruption between the word and
the thing has another curious effect. A man who has
an extreme dislike to parting with his money without
an equivalent, is frequently very ready to give away
gratuitously that equivalent when it comes into his
possession. Look at the scene which takes place at a
dinner-party; but in order to understand the better
its moral, imagine that the good things on the table are
the actual money they have cost.
'What will you have?' says l'Amphytrion ou l'on

instead a pile of quartern-loaves, a respectable cheese,
and a stone or two of butcher-meat, they would have
been cheerfully accorded the honour of ranking among
the useful classes; yet the two payments are virtually
identical, and the mistake of the operatives is merely
another illustration of the mystery of money.
This mystery is so unfathomable, that few men can
tell correctly whether they are rich or poor. A man
in the middle rank, whose moderate income is just
sufficient for the comfortable support of his family in
the station to which they belong, reckons himself
comparatively poor because he has not more than
enough. He looks at the stately dwelling of a neigh-
bour, the multitude of its apartments, the number of
servants required to take care of them, and the beauty of
the promenades in the demesne to which he and others
are allowed free access. 'Alas!' exclaims the repining

rest of his house is to be inhabited at all, it must be so

he is only better than an innkeeper in having, to some
extent, the choice of his guests. For then he keeps
numerous apartments in order; for their wants he
provides; and for their convenience he employs a
retinue of servants. This rich man does not attempt

JOKE.
A PRACTICAL
THE Signor Giulio Mercadante was an Italian noble-
man of merry disposition, who delighted in frolic and
jovial disportments, whether in season or out of season.
But into the villa of this enemy of care death entered
suddenly and awfully. One of his followers, Baptista
by name, a man of ferocious bearing, of great strength,
and of bad repute, was found dead in the garden,
stilettoed by an assassin. Report with her many
tongues had been busy with his name, whispering that
he, as well as another of the signor's servants, named
Francesco, had been once enrolled in a bandit troop,
but having quarrelled with their chieftain, had thrown
off their allegiance, and taken service with the more
peaceful Signor Mercadante. People murmured that
it was hardly safe to trust them as inmates within the
walls of a commonplace, everyday, legally - organised
villa. But what was it to them? The signor was
surely the best judge of the organisation of his own
household; and he knew their former history as well
as he knew that at present they were his faithful though
rude varlets.
'If,' said his lordship, they have been robbers, so
much the worse for them: they are good servants now,
so much the better for me. May the Holy Virgin'-
and here he would cross himself-intercede for their
pardon for the past, and bring before the throne of
grace their present faithful service and good deeds!'
When he was told of Baptista's fate he grieved and
stormed; he called upon his patron saint to witness
his registered vow of vengeance; and then with kindred
spirits he sat himself down to his evening repast.
Meantime the body of the murdered man was placed
in a kind of summer-house, which stood at some little
distance from the villa, and which had Venetian win-
dows opening upon the garden. Here an old crone
had paid all necessary duties to the departed, and here
his friend Francesco came to see that nothing had been
omitted which the custom of his country deemed
needful.
And thou art to be with him this night, Fran-
cesco?' said the woman. 'I wish thee hearty joy of
thy office! But mind thee, my boy, to leave the
window open, that when the Evil One comes for his
own there may be no impediment to his entrance.'
'What sayest thou, old mother?' asked the young
Italian, stealing a glance at the corpse.
'Why,' said the crone, I give you a friendly
warning- that's all. Have you not heard, maestro,
that when the clock strikes twelve the Evil One comes
for his own?'-and here there was a devout touching
of the forehead and shoulders, to signify the form of the
cross and have you not heard that at the same
moment the good angels come for their own?-and if
there be any impediment in the way to or from the
chamber of death, wo be to him who causes it!'
'And what, think you, will be the message for our
old comrade there?' said Francesco, trying, under a
mask of levity, to hide the perturbation within.
"Think!' said the old woman- I do not think about
so plain a matter! In his lifetime it is well known
that Baptista sold himself to the Evil One; and he
will surely claim his own. So keep a watch, and leave
the window open, that his entering may not be barred.
And now, good-night, and fair slumbers keep thee
from harm.' And the hag, in nowise deceived by
Francesco's manner, chuckled and hugged herself with
her skinny arms as she tottered from the death-
chamber.
The Signor Giulio Mercadante meanwhile was enter-
taining his guests-three young men as thoughtless as
himself-with the hapless fate of his domestic; remark-
ing how curious it was that one with deportment in
general so rude and ferocious should have the power of
inspiring, where it so pleased him, the strongest attach-
ment. He himself confessed to have been brought in
some slight degree under this inexplicable influence, and
to have felt a certain affection for his uncouth follower.
But the greatest proof of this nameless power, he said,
was evinced in Francesco; for this poor fellow, despite
his former lawless career, was known to be a most
unhesitating believer in all kinds of apparitions, be
they good or evil: he dreaded ghosts and goblins-he
feared the dead. Yet, with all this, he was going to
keep guard in the lonely summer-house beside the
corpse of his friend, because he deemed that so doing
was a proof of the love and friendship he had ever
borne him; and the signor marvelled that the poor
fellow had not at least asked some person to keep him
company in this mournful vigil. This discourse led
to a discussion of the notions entertained by the
peasantry respecting the struggle of the good and
evil angels for the spirit of man as it left its mortal
tenement; and the conversation suggested ideas to the
Signor Giulio Mercadante which were infinitely tempting
to a practical joker. Forthwith he summoned Pietro,
one of his serving-men-a fine soldierly-looking
fellow, not at all unlike the deceased Baptista in person,
but very dissimilar to the poor watcher, Francesco, in
character, being a boastful scoffer at all belief in the
agency of the invisible world.
6
Here, Pietro,' said his master, 'would you in guerdon
for small service like to earn this?' And he held up
delicately by the fore-finger and thumb a silken purse,
through the open network of which there glittered
several silver coins.
6
Say but the word, signor,' replied the man, and the
purse shall be mine!'
6
Hark, then!' said his master: you know that
some vile assassin has given the deathblow to my poor
Baptista, who is even now stiffening on his funereal
couch in the summer-house; and you know, too, that
his comrade Francesco keeps him company?'
The man acquiesced by a bow.
'I should like,' continued the Signor Giulio, to cure
this simple Francesco of the foolish fancies he enter-
tains respecting the dead: it might make him a better
servitor for the future. I care not to have one in my
train who starts at shadows after nightfall, though he
be valiant enough in the broad daylight; and for this
I want your wit and aid.'

'I, signor!' said Pietro, as he curled his moustache.

with none but the slain beside me; and methinks if
the dead could ever give cause for dread, they would
do so at such a time and in such a place. But, tush!
they were as incapable of moving as the soil on which
they were stretched.' And he snapped his fingers
above his head as he spoke.
6
Then,' said his master, you will not hesitate to
take the place of Baptista for this night, and to play
the part of a dead man?'
Signor!' said the puzzled servitor.
'This,' said the signor, is what I require of you-
simply to lie motionless and stiff in his stead, to deceive
Francesco. Mark well what he does; and when the

The timepiece struck half-past eleven. Another half

fervently he wished that just for a few minutes in that
term the journal would prove a soporific to Francesco,
and allow him the opportunity of easing his cramped
frame!
Now, had poor Francesco been really thinking of
the journal, it is ten chances to one that he might have

will, He recalled those scenes in which he had stood
side by side with the murdered Baptista-scenes of

Well, let us try him!' said their host, who now
fairly found himself in his element, and who with his

Francesco,
Two of them proceeded to the summer-house, where
they found Francesco keeping watch by his friend's
body, and telling him that his master desired his pre-
sence, they removed the corpse during his absence, and
placed Pietro upon the funereal couch.
1
Night was drawing her sable curtains round the
earth when Francesco, returned with a cigar, a bottle of
wine, and some old journals, as aids to enable him to
pass the night with composure. He placed the table
at the farther end of the room, with a lamp upon it,
and sat, it may be well believed, with his back to
the couch. He tried to become deeply interested in
the journals in vain his eyes saw the characters, but
these would not impress themselves on his brain. Now
and then, but evidently with an effort, le turned his
head slowly over his shoulder to steal a glance at the
supposed dead man; and often he started, and
nervously glanced round the room.
All this for a time served highly to amuse the stiff
and motionless Pietro; indeed he would have willingly
given vent to his laughter, the more so as he dared not;
-
rade that it was one of those former
who never forgave a desertion from their band, and
whose vows of vengeance were always kept. But how
had they hunted him out? Then there came the con-
viction that he too was a marked man; and somehow
with that conviction there flashed across his mind
doubts of the old woman who had laid out Baptista for
burial, and who seemed so perfectly acquainted with
his former life, He too well knew how many agents
among the poor the robbers could command. What if
information of his lonely watch should have been com-
municated to them, and that, in order to give facility
to their purpose, he had been desired to leave the
window open-advice given under the mask of super-
stitious fear?
These and similar conjectures chased one another
through his brain, until he forgot his ideal alarms in
what he considered more, substantial causes for fear.
Under their influence he rose from his chair and paced
up and down the room 92cment

there, followed no movement all was stiff, rigid,

tossed off a glass of wine. The old woman's words
recurred to his memory afresh; perhaps,
after all, was given in sincerity. He approached the
window half-credulously, half-mistrustfully. He opens
it. He places himself in the shade, and looks out;
and soon his attention becomes so riveted upon what
and this inclination gave him a tickling sensation in
his throat, which cost a superhuman effort to repress it.
What relief a cough or a hem would have given him!
Then after awhile he became weary-the remaining
perfectly still for so long a time was a far more difficult
task than he had imagined; and in order to nerve
self to the endurance of such a part to the end, he had
to bear in mind not only the glittering purse, but also
that mocking incredulity which he had seen, so legibly
impressed upon the faces of his master's guests. No,'

the rate of 500 to 600 miles per hour; or at night,

the pendulum as a test of the rotatory motion

public attention, has likewise served to bring the whole
subject of the earth's rotation into discussion. It is
strange to think that, not more than two centuries
ago, this same subject occupied the attention of nien,
of science and intelligence throughout the whole of
Europe, and, we may say, the civilised world, though
in a very different way. At the beginning of the
seventeenth century, the doctrines of Copernicus,
timidly divulged about fifty years before, were taken
up by Galileo, and fully and boldly asserted. It
took fifty years more, however, before they were even
partially credited in Europe; and it is surprising to
find the acute and learned, and, on the whole, very
candid Sir Thomas Browne, even so late as 1616; deny
ing lus beef in such doctrines. In his Vulgar Errors
is the following sentence:Nor will it atquit the
of those who quarrel with all things, or
find that during every passing hour and minute both
the moon and earth recede, though with very different
velocities, from the tiny, twinkling orb.
We owe to one of England's most celebrated astrono-
mers of former days, Dr Halley, the first true expo-
sition of the atmospheric currents. He first pointed out
that in a current of air coming from the pole to the
equator, there is a much less lateral velocity in high
latitudes than in low; or, in other words, while the
air at the equator is carried from west to east with
a velocity of 1000 miles an hour, the air within the
polar circles only moves with a velocity of 100 or 200
miles an hour, diminishing almost to nothing
pole itself. From this circumstance arises the wen-
known direction of the trade-winds north and south
of the equator, which, instead of blowing directly
north and south respectively, acquire a direction of
north-east and south-east. This circumstance, once
ascertained, is perhaps one of the most self-evident
insatters concerning whose verities we have proofs of the rotation of the earth a proof not liable
this pects in Galileo and his contemporary motion is from 900 to 1000 miles an hour, the motion
The consequence is, that the earth outstrips the air-
current, which, so to speak, is left behind. Now, we
know that in travelling on a railway with a velocity of
thirty miles an hour, if the air is not moving at all,
we encounter a wind blowing at the rate of thirty
miles an hour, forming a stiff breeze; but say that
there is a gentle current blowing along with us of
fifteen miles an hour, still we outstrip it, and create
for ourselves a counter-current with half the velocity,
or fifteen miles an hour.'

Sir Christopher Wren, dean of Windsor, and father
of the celebrated architect of St Paul's. He denounces
the ney doctrine with veliemence, and without any
reservation whatever, and may well be taken as a type
of the prejudiced and ill-informed objectors of the time,
as well as of all times, to any doctrine which disturbs
the still quiet of old-fashioned and long-received opi-
nion. It is amusing, and in some respects edifying, to
glance over the various objections propounded in those
days against the earth's rotation on its axis, and its
annual revolution round the sun. If the earth rotates
with such a velocity, say they, a stone thrown up into
the air should be left a far way behind; and so should
the air or atmosphere itself, and especially the water
of the ocean. Now, to some extent the two latter at
least of these phenomena do take place, but not in the
way which the objectors suppose. In a general way
the atmosphere and the ocean revolve as part and por-
tion of the solid earth, and even the stone thrown up
into the air still continues to preserve its motion as a
particle of the earth, and rather falls to the eastward
Did the earth, then, not turn on its axis at all, the
trade-winds ought always to blow due north and south
respectively on each hemisphere.
The experiment of Faucault is, we presume, so well
known to our readers, that we need not enter on it
here. It derives its interest, as a proof of the earth's
rotation, from the well-ascertained fact, that a pendulum
continues to rotate in the same plane in which it has
been set in motion. From this circumstance, and having
a free motion at the point of suspension, it preserves
its original plane of rotation while the point of suspen-
sion, and consequently the part of the earth's surface

generality of cases cost the customer a shilling, they
can very well afford to do.
Sometimes a member of this fraternity will lay by
his umbrellas and repairing-kit for a season, and betake
himself to an analogous pursuit in the sale of walking-
sticks. In carrying out this branch of his profession,
he becomes the subject of a temptation to which he is
not always superior. True he is a 'natty' hand at a
walking-stick; and though he may not be, like Sir
Plume, critically correct in the nice conduct of a
clouded cane,' he is an admirable judge of the quality
of canes in general, from the common chair-bottom
bamboo to the costly amber-coloured Malacca. The
perfection of his judgment in this particular has indeed
been the source of the moral declension above hinted
at. In his purchases of second-hand umbrellas, or per-
haps in his barterings with serving-maids at gentle-
men's back-doors, he meets occasionally with specimens
of which the stick is a good partridge-cane. This, truth
compels us to say, he invariably extracts (substituting
a common one of beech), and dressing it up as a walk-
ing-stick, readily disposes of it as such at the price of
a shilling or eighteenpence-the regular price for such
a cane being from half-a-crown to three-and-sixpence.
The purchaser soon makes the agreeable discovery that
he has parted with his money to no purpose, and that
his bargain, like most bargains, is good for nothing-
the cane proving unsound, and snapping short at about
a foot from the lower extremity. He sees when it is
too late that his new walking-stick had done service as
the rod of an umbrella-that it had been excavated at
the part where it has now broken, for the insertion of
the spring-that the wood had become rotten from the
moisture collected there, and had consequently given
way upon the first pressure. It is impossible to detect
the imposture by examination before purchase the
cavity being cleverly filled with an imitative composi-
tion, and the whole subsequently varnished over.
Not a few of the ambulatory umbrella-merchants
and menders are Jews, who are at all times ready and
willing to exchange their wares or their skill for any
portable species of marketable commodities. The
writer many years ago took lessons in Hebrew from a
travelling umbrella-mender, who read into such English
as he was master of he being by birth a Pole-any
part of the Old Testament with the utmost ease and
rapidity. He did the same with equal fluency with a
Bible Society copy of the Hebrew New Testament, and
plainly shewed, by his remarks on what he read, that
the contents were entirely new to him.
No farther back than the 14th of last month, a
picturesque-looking figure, stately and erect as a young
oak, but grizzled with the frosts of near seventy win-
ters, knocked with his knuckles at my window, as I sat
tapping at the outer wall of my brain, to try if any
ideas were within, and civilly requested to know if I
had any umbrellas to mend. There was something
in the man's face which forbade the abrupt negative
that was already upon my lips: age, honesty, suffering,
and something besides that is indefinable, compelled
me to comply with his desire. He was clad in a garb
which bore very solid pretensions to antiquity-smooth
and shining with the unctuous friction of years, yet
carefully stitched and mended throughout. I judged
him to be an old soldier; and, mindful of the tale of
the ancient mariner,' I found the means of setting
him to work upon a job which occupied him for three-
quarters of an hour, during which, in compliance with
the inquiries I plied him with, he delivered himself at
intervals to the following effect :-
"This here's a French humrellar: I know'd he was
a Frenchman afore I laid hold of him. I knows the
make of that sort well enough. Ha-I reklect the
time when we used to get five or six-and-thirty shillin'
for a good silk un. Free-trade in humrellars and free-
trade in bread! Well, one tells up agin t'other, I s'pose.
I had a pretty good taste of the French once in my
time.'
'Have you lived in France?'
'Four year two months and twenty-seven days.'
'You have kept a pretty exact account. I hope you
enjoyed your sojourn there?'
'Not a bit of it; bein' I went there again' my will,
and was a prisoner of war pretty well the whole time.'
'Pray, how came that about?'
'Why, you see 'tis more nor forty years agone
now- -full that since I first went and listed in the
army. About the end of 1810 I were servant to an
officer, and sailed with my master from Lisbon to join
the garrison of English and Spaniards as lay beleaguered
by the French in Cadiz. I was onfortnitly took ill of
a fever the very day as I stepped aboard, and con-
fined to my berth all the voyage. Having the weather
again' us, we were sixteen days at sea afore we came
in sight of the Isle of Leon. But we never got there:
a bad storm druv us ashore full ten miles or more to
the west of Cadiz, and we was wrecked. While all
hands was trying what they knowed to save the crew
and transports, the French kept firing on us all the
time.'
Such cruelty is not cus-
'Are you sure of that?
tomary in civilised warfare.'
'I says nothin' but what's true. You see we had
been driving in the storm under bare poles, and hadn't
got a flag to strike; so that we couldn't shew no
surrender: besides, 'twasn't the reglar French army
as took us, but a gang of irreglars as worked on their
own account again' the British. The want of a flag to
strike cost us a good many of our men killed by their
shots. There was a good many sick besides myself,
for the fever had spread a good deal on board; and
when the enemy seen our hands a-gettin' the sick men
out in their hammocks, and lowering 'em into the
boats, they left off firing; and though they didn't offer
no assistance, they allowed us to land as well as we
could. We all got ashore pretty nigh, but every one
on us was made prisoners to a gang of fellows made up
of the raff of all nations-French, Italian, and Irish
volunteers for the most part-fighting for the sake of
prize-money under the patronage of Marshal Victor.
They forced the Portuguese sailors, and a lot of our
own fellows too, to bear a hand in plundering the
vessel; and when they had got all they could out of
her, they set fire to her. I see her blow up as I lay
shiverin' in my hammock under a ledge of a rock in
the middle of the night. I was dreadful bad for a long
time while we lay in prison that winter, wi' nothin'
better than straw for a bed, and that most times wet.
They turned the sick out of their hammocks, and
bundled us all together upon one heap of rotten straw.
But our lads stood by one another, and my master
done what he could to have me took care of, though he
could not come and see me. As the spring come on I
got better, along o' many more; though some of the
poor fellows died just when they should have got well
for want of warmth and nourishment. The Frenchmen
wanted us to work in the trenches, and we might have
got out of prison if we would ha' done it. But that
didn't suit us, and we were allowed to decline it, pre-
ferring to be marched off to prison to France. If I was
to live for a thousand years-which, thank Heaven, I
shan't-I shouldn't forget that there miserable march.
We was seven months on the route, sometimes a target
for grilly fighters, who never shewed their faces till
they sent a volley of shot among us-sometimes short
of victuals and water-sometimes camped for the night
on the top of a frosty rock without a bit o' coverin'
beyond our own flutterin' rags. There was ne'er a bit
of shoe or stocking among us by the time we had been
a month on the route-no change o' linen-no victuals
fit to keep the soul in a man's body-and no bed to
lie on arter the horrible fatigue of a march wi' bare

feet over a mountainous country. Many times we was
all druv together into a hole where-half on us couldn't
lie down at once. A good number of the prisoners got
so badly knocked up on the road before we had crossed
the mountains, that they was forced to be left behind,
where some died, and some got well, and was exchanged,
and joined the duke's army. If it hadn't been a little
better travellin' in France than it was in Spain, I'm
pretty sure I should have left my bones there. We
marched all through France into French Elandors.
When at last we got to Cambray, there wasn't much
more than seventy of us out of wellnigh two hundred
that escaped out of the vessel. My master was left
behind on parole, and was exchanged, and, worse luck
for me and him too, poor man, was killed in battle
before I got my liberty, Tis a bad thing to go to
prison, but 'twas the happiest day of my life, 'cept the
day as I got out, when I first got into the prison at

upon, and a mouthful of decent victuals to comfort
me. I stayed here near three years, and, considerin' all
things. wasn't very badly off. My master, while he
lived, didn't forget me, and through a French officer as
he had made his friend, I got many indulgences and

enemy, cost us some thousands of lives, and spiled the
success of Colonel Thornton, who carried the battery
on the tother side o' the river but was also obliged to
retreat, because the whole force was blown to pieces,
and there was nothing left to back him. If we had
mastered that battery before we did anything else, and
reduced the town first on that side of the water, we
should have had a different tale to tell about New
Orleans at this time of day. After all, the 'Merricans
had no pluck. They might ha' druv us into the river
if they had the sperrit to come arter us. They had
more than ten thousand men, and we was reduced to
two thousand effectives; but they let us retreat in order,
with guns and baggage, to our vessels fifteen miles off.

Son began and terminated, all that could be called'
atventurous in the career of Robert Wodrow. The
child who entered the world at a moment of such wild
exoitement and péril was to lead a quiet, prosperous
life, devoted to his ministerial duties in the pleasant
rurale parishhoff Eastwood, and to his literary labours
and collections. He had no farther troubles save theo-
logical controversies in his own church, and save
annoyance suffered from the remaining Cameronians.
Of these, his chief worldly source of trouble, he says,
om the occasion of his having, contrary to their tenets,
observed a government fast):15 Instead of the converse,
I some time a-day had with exercised Christians about
their own spiritual case, I was engaged in disputes
about the public and about separation, and how to
defend the lawfulness and duty of hearing me preach
the gospel, and for the most part to no effect. So that
many a time it was a terror to me to go out among
them; and coming to particular places, I often looked
very blunt, finding myself beset with contemners of
me and my ministry, who often kept not within the
bounds of common civility, emozione
The collections made by Wodrow are in some measure
dispersed a portion, chiefly biographical, is in the
University of Glasgow ; others are in ecclesiastical
libraries, and in the possession of private individuals.
But the largest and most valuable department is in
the Advocates' Library, where its extent and variety is
a wonderful testimony to the collector's diligence. The
circumstances which brought so large a portion of them
to light are interesting. The many manuscripts scat-
tered here and there, which were either in Wodrow's
handwriting or bore marks of having been in his
possession, prompted the Rev. Dr Burns his de-
scendant, we believe to institute a general search, for
the purpose of bringing all that could be found to
light. With the valuable aid,' he says in a letter to
the editor of Wodrow's Analecta, of Mrs Wodrow,
grand-daughter of the historian, who had a good many
manuscripts, in her own possession, and who gave me
useful hints as to the probable resting-places of others,
I succeeded, partly by domiciliary visits to garrets and
other repositories where these exuvia had remained for
a series of years undisturbed, and partly by cor-
responding with surviving relatives of the historian,
in unkennelling from the dust of years some fourscore
volumes of various sizes, and almost all in excellent
preservation. One portion of the collection was of use
only to a peculiar class of students. It consisted of
lectures, sermons, homilies, and other compositions of
a similar class, by the father of the historian, the
historian himself, his brother Alexander, several of the
worthies of the covenanting age, and many of the
theological students under Professor Wodrow, from
1690 to 17072 Forty volumes, containing matter of
more general interest to history and literature, were
transferred to the Advocates' Library, where, along
with several others, they constitute The Wodrow
Collection. A considerable portion of it consists of
the historian's correspondence. He preserved and
bound up the letters addressed to him; and having an
equally good opinion of his own, he copied them, in his
peculiar, compact, square hand, into volumes. Three
volumes are still in existence; another, the earliest of
the series, has been lost sight of. His writing is as
close and compact as small print. The three little
volumés contain about six hundred letters, and some
of them by no means brief. But all that is worth
knowing of his own personal correspondence is now
pretty accessible in one of the publications of the
Wodrow Society. This is one of the book-clubs which
have lately sprung up. It was instituted in May 1841,
for the publication of the works of the fathers and
early writers of the Reformed Church of Scotland.' It
was very worthily named after one who had worked so
amply in the same field; and besides his biographies
of eminent clergymen, of which he wrote many, the
society printed his correspondence in three octavo
volumes.
+
The miscellaneous documents in the Wodrow Col-
lection cover a very wide field. A catalogue of them
fills a considerable volume, and one wonders how a
country clergyman could have got such papers into his
possession. Many of them were connected with the
great civil wars; and one might turn over à despatch
with a reference to Oliver Cromwell, Esq.,' on which
the sand still adhered, or a letter from the unfortunate
Laud, which sometimes puzzled the reader with its
signature of Gul. Kant.'-a contraction of Gulielmus
Kantuariensis-William of Canterbury. Some portions
of the Collection go over still more distant ground, as
popes bulls, minutes of catholic councils, foreign diplo-

matic negotiations, and the like. Many of the papers
are copies made in Wodrow's own peculiar, square,
regular handwriting; and the extent of these alone,
besides his collections and original writings, might have
entitled him to his designation of 'The Indefatigable.'
Among the most curious of his copied manuscripts is
Lord Ruthven's relation of the murder of Rizzio. This
strange, characteristic account, though it has been
more than once printed, is scarcely known to general
readers. There have naturally, notwithstanding its
picturesqueness and air of reality, been doubts of its
authenticity; but Wodrow's painstaking preservation
of a copy is something in its favour. It is a strange
piece of brutal ruffianism, and curiously illustrates
the manners of the court and aristocracy of Scot-
land in that day. According to his own account,
when the conspirators burst into the apartment, he
called out, That it would please her majesty to let
yonder man, Davie, come out, for he hath been owr
lang there!' The purpose for which Davie was thus
courteously asked out was that of being killed. The
tragedy is described; but almost more characteristic
than the deed of violence is the coolness of the ruffian
after it is over. "The said Lord [Ruthven] being so
enfeebled with his sickness and wearie of his travel,
that he desired her majesty's pardon to sit down upon
a coffer, and called for a, drink for God's sake! So a
Frenchman brought him a cup of wine, and after that
he had drunken, the queen's majesty began to rail
against the said lord-Is this your sickness, Lord
Ruthven? The said lord answered: God forbid that
your majesty had such a sickness! for I had rather
give all the moveable goods that I have. Then said
her majesty: If she died, or her bairn or common-
weal perished, she should leave the revenge thereof to
her friends to revenge the same upon the said Lord
Ruthven and his posterity; for she had the king of
Spain her great friend, the Emperor likewise, and
the king of France her good brother, the Cardinal of
Lorrain, and her unkels in France; besides the Pope's
holiness, and many other princes in Italy. The said
lord answered, that these noble princes were over-great
personages to meddle with such a poor man as he was,
being her majesty's own subject,' &c.
divergences in all directions, and especially into
natural history, if what is altogether supernatural can
admit of that name. In one place we have the mar
vellous consequences where a corby bigged in a tree
at Balmaclellan, and the Laird of Home, a brisk and
venturesome young gentleman, went up and with danger
climbed the tree, and took out the eggs, and boiled
them hard, and put them again in the nest. We are
sorry to be obliged to tantalise the reader, but the
consequences of this anomalous act on the population
of Scotland were of a kind which cannot well be told
to the polite ears of the present day. Immediately after
it comes another natural-history anecdote which will
better bear telling:
6
The same person tells me another accompt which
he had from a very sensible gentleman about four or
five miles from him. There is a rock beside a loch
where the earns or eagles do bigg. There was one part
of it very convenient, which a corby or raven chose to
bigg her nest in. Within a while one of the earns came
and dispossessed her. After some struggle for some
days, at length the corby went off, and was not seen
for several weeks-ten or twelve. At length the corby
came back with a little bird with it, about twice the
largeness of a sparrow, and waited and hovered about
the place. One day the gentleman observed, and the
earn is coming out of his nest, and the corby attacks
him, and the little bird joined. And after some time's
struggle, and the bird striking below the earn at her
breast, he observed the little bird strike with the side
of its wing at the neck of the earn. At length, after
several misses, it struck off the earn's neck as if it had
been done with a razor, and the neck and trunk fell
down to the earth, with a little feather, which he took
up and supposed was the instrument of cutting! It
was very stiff, and sharper than a razor, and full of
blood.'-(Analecta, iii. 88.)
The Analecta' are strewed with ghost stories,
some of them very picturesque. There is a long
and somewhat tedious description of the troubles
suffered by the inmates of a haunted house, the
ghostly persecutor of which appears to have been a
person of a very substantial kind. The family

scarcely less curious and amusing book. This has

A little farther on is a very Highland-like incident of
one seeing a vision of a friend with a dirk sticking in
his breast. That night he was stabbed by a tinker,
whom, as a magistrate, he had punished.

him! One day discoursing with Marvell on the head,
since no reasoning would prevail with him, he advised
him to this experiment: to cause make a little cabin of
timber, with the one side glass and the top glass, as
close as could be, and enclose himself there, and let the
sun beat on him; and when all was close, if he observed
any flees there come out of his body it was weel; if not,
then to cast off the prejudice! The machine was made,
and Harrington and Marvell goes in. There is no appear-
ance of flees. Marvell sat with him till, with its close-
ness and heat, he was almost suffocated. On which he
went out, and came directly to the advocate and told
him the story, complaining that he was a greater fool
himself than Harrington, who continued still in the
imagination, saying he did not know but something in
the machine might then hinder flees coming out of
him.'
RAMBLES IN SEARCH OF WILD-FLOWERS.
my own.
AUGUST.
HAVING been prevented by the lateness of the hour
from botanising the heath and hillside on my return
from Daleage bogs, I resolved on taking the earliest
opportunity of doing so; and therefore, shortly after
that pleasant excursion, I again set forth on my donkey,
and with my intelligent young companion, George the
donkey-boy, whose ardour for flowers almost equalled
There was, however, this difference between
us that with him it was an entirely new pursuit, a
passion taken up on the moment, and carried on in a
state of profound ignorance, so that oftentimes he
brought to me as wonders plants which he must have
daily seen, but which, from his attention having never
been directed to the subject, he had hitherto passed
by unnoticed; whilst with me a love of flowers had
'grown with my growth and strengthened with my
strength,' and from that root of love had sprung up a
power of discrimination which had led to much plea-
sure and some knowledge. George's eyes were, how
ever, in a measure opened, and I doubt not that the
film has not again gathered over them, but that he
will throughout, life look on nature with a more
enlightened and interested mind than he ever did
before. And now that I am on the subject, let me
suggest to those who are in the habit of country
rambles, and are informed on any subject of interest,
how much pleasure they might give, and how much
knowledge they might impart, if they were more ready
to communicate with others, especially with those
below them in station. If you can succeed in draw-
ing the attention of your donkey-boy, or the servant
who attends you in your walk or ride, or of the cottage
child who acts as your guide amid those rural haunts
which you are in the habit of exploring, to natural
pursuits, and allure them to search out and understand
a little of those bright objects which surround them,
and which you are yourself studying with interest,
whether those objects be trees, or flowers, or birds, or
shells, or fossils, you do them the greatest service.
There is no need for giving them technical knowledge:
much important and deeply-interesting information
may be imparted without using one hard word or tech-
nical term; and by opening their eyes to discern beau-
ties and detect wonders in those things which lie within
their reach, but which have hitherto been shut out from
them from the want of a little instruction, you supply
them with a legitimate source of rational amusement
and employment for powers and thoughts otherwise idle,
and by so doing may in many cases be the means of
keeping them from yielding to the temptations which
besets vacant minds of finding amusement in scenes of
vice and folly. He who delights in a garden, in watch-
ing birds, in classing or collecting flowers or shells, or
in any other country pursuit, is less likely to be found
in an alehouse than he who has no such interests. By
all means try to bring as many minds as possible under
such wholesome influence, and never count it loss of
time or of dignity to endeavour to point out the lead-
ing characteristics of the plants, or other natural
objects they bring you, and their wonderful structure
and uses; and in so doing you will have a good opening
to direct their minds to Him who formed all these
wondrous and beautiful objects for man's delight, and to
lead them to 'look through nature up to nature's God.'

By the time my excursions were over George was
delight open to him, and one which, being easily gra-
tified, I have no doubt beguiled him of many weary
hours when, tramping beside his donkey, he would have
otherwise been very dull. The day had been very hot,
and continued so even after I had set out. I therefore
abandoned the high road, which I should have other-
wise followed, and diving into the shady lanes, soon
found myself again following the course of the brook in
its way from sweet Daleage. As I rode on I found that
handsome species of the galium tribe-the wild madder
(Rubia peregrina.) This plant seems to be confined
chiefly, if not entirely, to the south-west of England and
Wales, and abounds in Devon and Cornwall. Its long
branches waving high and wide in all directions, like
others of that family, are great ornaments to the
hedges. The chief difference in appearance between it
racter of its leaves, which grow from four to six in a
and the galiums consists in the hard, persistent cha-
whorl, are elliptical, shining, and smooth, with a fringe
of sharp, short teeth, very thickly set at the margin. The
stem is square and branched; the flowers of a yellowish
green, in compound terminal panicles. (The panicle is
a sort of loose, subdivided cluster.) The berry is black,
and something like an ivy berry; but either it forms
seed sparingly, or else the birds eat it early, for though
have seldom found it in fruit. Its long branches hang
the plant grows profusely throughout the district, I
on the hedges all the winter, the leaves being then
dead, brown, and dry. It takes its generic name from
Ruber, red; to dye which colour some of the species
are used.
The wall-pennywort (Cotyledon umbilicus) abounds
in this neighbourhood, though marked as 'rare' by
some authors. It is a singular plant: the leaf is thick,
round, and very succulent, the stem being inserted
into the centre like a nastartium-leaf; it grows as
low as the stone-crops, and from the root rises a
purplish flower- stalk of from about eight to twelve
inches in height, according to the amount of soil and
sun of which it partakes.
The flowers are pale,
greenish-yellow little bells, arranged in a double row
on one side of the stem, like the lily of the valley.
One of the cottages at Knowle which I passed exhibits
this plant in its greatest beauty, the whole thatch being
ornamented with clusters of it, which have apparently
grown there for very many successive years-the old
decaying plants forming annually fresh pabulum for
the crops of the succeeding year, until the whole has
become one mass of verdure; the clear, semi-transparent

leaves and stems, with the bunchies of tall, upright
flower-stalks and delicate flowers amassed on it, giving
to the irregular roof of dark thatch a most singular
and beautiful appearance. The tops of thatched houses
and sheds, as well as old walls, are very favourite
habitats of the pennywort, and it is also often found
bursting out from between the interstices of the red-
sandstone rock which is so abundant in South Devon,
on which it looks very handsome, as well as on the
high banks which almost overhang our Devonshire
lanes.

that it is the lesser dodder (Cuscuta epithimum), a plant
which I had not before seen, although it not unfre-

of the natural order convolvulace, and is parasitic on

But now I turn my eyes and mind from the more
distant beauties to the immediate object I have in
view; and lo! before me and around me, on all sides,
a most inexplicable appearance claims my attention.
This singular object, whether animal or vegetable,
natural or artificial-for I am in some doubt at first
appears like an interminable mass of tiny scarlet
cords, twined in an inextricable maze over and around
every twig of heath, or furze within my range, and
knit together and matted over the tops of the plants,
running from one to another in every direction, and
both on the lower and the upper shoots. I examine
it more closely, and see that it is evidently a vegetable
production, and that the red cord-like material is as
evidently the stem of a plant, and not, as I at first
almost believed, the web of some sort of spider (though
the thickness of the cord would, on examination, have
refuted such an idea, it being in the stoutest parts as
large as a coarse silk thread, though towards the points
scarcely thicker than a hair.) I search for leaves, but
there are none a few stunted scales being the only
substitute; then for the root, but here I am sorely
puzzled, for I cannot trace any of the shoots, to the
earth; blossoms, there are in abundance the little
white knobs which break the lines of the thread in ten
thousand places consisting of clusters of little flowers,
which I find, on examining them under a microscope,

There is but one other species of dodder in England
Cuscuta Europea, the greater dodder which is parasitic
on nettles, flax, &c. Griffith speaks of a gigantic
species in Afghanistan, which even preys on itself,
one mass of which half-covered a willow of from
twenty to thirty feet high. A fit emblem this of the
morbid self-tormentor who wounds biniself, and sucks,
as it were, his own life-blood by means of the convolu-
tion of his own rootless fancies. In tropical countries
orchideous and other parasites abound, but in England
we have few which can properly be so called. The
misletoe iscum alla), that plant of Druidical cele
brity, is one. In Somersetshire, and in many other
counties, the apple-trees are loaded with huge bunches
of this very curious plant; but in Devonshire it is not
to be found growing, though, from the rapidity and
cheapness of conveyance, it is commonly imported at
Christmas, and Devonshire people are no longer
deprived of its presence among the forests of holly
which decorate every house at that mystic season.
The misletoe is a curious and interesting shrubby
plant, of the natural order Loranthaceae. Its stems, of
a peculiar green, are repeatedly forked and jointed; its
leaves grow in pairs, are lance-shaped and rounded at
the point, the texture being thick, and succulent, and
becoming leathery as the juices of the plant dry up; the
flowers are small and unnoticeable, of a yellowish-green,
in terminal heads; and it is only the white semi-trauspa
rent berry, almost like white cornelian, which is in per-
fection at mid-winter, that gives it interest. This berry
is globular, smooth, and filled with a sort of slimy sub-
stance, in which is contained a single secd. It is supposed
that these seeds are carried by birds from tree to tree.
Griffiths states, that in this tribe the ripe seeds adhere
firmly to the substance to which they are applied by
means of their viscid coating, which hardens into a
transparent glue. In two or three days after appli-
cation the radicle curves towards the support, and as
soon as it reaches it, becomes enlarged and flattened';
by degrees, a union is formed between the woody system

tains; and it is also remarkable that this plant, though
found in the Azores and in Iceland, is wholly wanting
throughout all the continent of America, in which,
though possessed of such a noble and extensive Flora,
only one individual of the heath family has as yet been
found. I shall hope at a future time to enter further
on hillside topics: I must now forbear, for the setting
sun and rising fog warn me to seek my home before the
evening is too far advanced; therefore, with fine speci-
mens of dodder, &c. for my hortus siccus in my case, I
set forward, hoping that to-morrow will lead me to
'fresh fields and pastures new.'
INCIDENT DURING THE MUTINY OF 1797.
THE nineteenth century may now be said to have
attained middle age, and in the brilliant noonday of
its intellect and science the important events that
marked the close of its predecessor are becoming dim
and indistinct, like the vanishing images of a dissolving
view. Progress has been so rapid since the peace that
a wider chasm intervenes between 1799 and 1851 than
any dividing the preceding centuries: much more
than half a century appears to separate us from the
eighteenth. But a stirring and a troublous period lies
before this interval. Life, doubtless, was more rife with
interest and excitement to those whose youth belonged
to it than it is in this calmer age. One feels that the
'old people' of to-day have more of a history in their
lives' than our age will have; and even while we
acknowledge with devout gratitude the blessing of
peace, it is pleasant to listen to stories of the War-
time. One evening, whilst sitting with a relative of
our own gazing on the waters of the Channel, which
were trembling and quivering beneath the rosy sunset,
we expressed some such sentiments, and after agreeing
in our opinion that life in those days was more
animated by hope and fear than at present, he added,
smiling: For instance, in '97 I narrowly escaped
hanging!'
6
We were much surprised at such a declaration
from one who, at the time he spoke, was a brave and
distinguished admiral, and eagerly asked the 'how and
why' of the adventure; and he told us. We regret
that we cannot recall the exact words of the animated
relation, but we will try to give the substance as nearly
as possible.
In 1797 mutiny broke out among the seamen at
Spithead an inexcusable crime in the opinion of naval
men, but which he who related the story palliated in
some degree by candidly acknowledging that in those
days the poor fellows who were guilty of it had
great and just cause for complaint. They were not
only ill-paid, but their food was of very bad quality;
many captains in the navy were harsh and tyrannical-
as, in consequence of the perversity of human nature,
will probably always be the case; and the men whose
blood was freely poured out in the defence of their
native land were, to say the least, neglected and uncared
for by their rulers. Oh happy consequence of peace
and advancing knowledge! these men are now well-
fed, have the means of instruction afforded them, and
homes provided for them when, returning from the
dangers of the sea,' they are discharged and sent on
shore. The poor mutineers at Spithead dreamed not
of such advantages as these.
Admiral R- was a junior lieutenant on board the
Saturn when the mutiny broke out; but promotion was
very rapid then, and though bearing that rank he was still
only a youth in his teens. Probably the mutineers had
discovered, and in a measure appreciated the kindliness
of his nature, for, exempting him from the thraldom of
his companions, whom they had confined in the ward-
room, they fixed on him to bear their propositions and
their threats to the port-admiral-swearing at the same
time that if he did not bring them back a favourable
answer they would hang him on the yard-arm! He
was obliged to obey their will of course, secretly resolv-
ing, however, not to give them the opportunity of ful-
filling their kind intentions by returning to the ship;
but the young officer calculated too much upon being
his own master. He was put on shore at the Point,
and proceeded at once to the admiral's house in the
High Street. The naval chief gave him a good-natured
and cordial reception, and listened patiently to the
message he delivered from the mutineers, which was to
the effect that they must have an immediate advance of
wages, good biscuit, pork, &c. or that they would carry
their ship over to the French.
'Go on board again, sir,' was his reply, and tell
these gentlemen that none of their demands can be
listened to till they return to their duty: inform them
also that the moment they attempt to weigh anchor
hot shot will be fired on them from the Isle of Dogs,
and their vessel and themselves sent to the bottom.'
6
The lieutenant bowed and left the office. Outside
he paused. He was going, in obedience to his superior,
to certain death. It was a fearful trial of courage and
professional discipline.
A mother whom he idolised
lived at no great distance: he would at least bid her a
last farewell! But the admiral, aware of the sacrifice
he exacted, so much greater than that of perilling life
by mounting the deadly breach,' had followed the
poor boy, and lightly tapping his shoulder, told him he
would walk with him to the beach. Thus even the last
look at home for which he longed was denied him.
A waterman's wherry reconveyed him to the ship. It
was May-a bright glorious May, such as England
used to enjoy once upon a time;' and very sad were
the feelings with which the young officer looked back
upon the retreating town, and round on the glad sunny
waters and blue-tinted Isle of Wight, deeming that he
beheld them for the last time. Occasionally also, he
told us, his eyes would revert, in spite of his endeavours
to forget it, to the fatal yard-arm, distinct with all its
tracery of cordage against the clear blue sky. He
gained the ship, was received on board, and conducted
to the forecastle, where the chief mutineers had assem-
bled. Here he delivered his message. They were
greatly enraged, and commanded him not to repeat the
admiral's threat of sinking the ship to the crew.
replied simply that it was his duty to obey the orders
of his superior officer. Their looks and words threatened
him at first with instant and summary vengeance; but
after a short consultation they agreed to try him by a
court-martial, and proceeding aft, ordered him to be
brought before them. It was a fearful scene; the men
were terribly excited, frightfully ignorant, and believed
that their cause required a victim.
He
The courage of the youth bore him through the trial,
however, bravely. He ventured boldly to reproach
them with their guilt in confounding the innocent with
those whom they looked upon as their enemies; taunted
them with the cowardly injustice of the deed they
contemplated; and persisted, in opposition to the ring-
leaders' commands, in repeating the admiral's message
to the crew. He was heard by the officers in the ward-
room, and their loud cheers when he spoke probably
gave him fresh courage. The ringleaders becoming
alarmed at the effect his words and bearing might have
on the British instincts of the ship's company, con-
demned him to be hung in two hours' time, and ordered
him to prepare for death meantime in his cabin. There
a new and singular scene awaited him: one of the
seamen had taken possession of it, opened his lockers,
and finding some brandy, had been drinking till he was
perfectly intoxicated, and lay in the sleep of drunken-
ness on the floor, which was strewed and littered
with the lieutenant's clothes, books, &c.
A deep
oath escaped the lips of the ringleaders at this sight.
Throughout the fleet the mutineers had forbidden
drunkenness on pain of death; for, fully aware of the

111
peril of their position, they kept up among themselves
a terribly severe discipline. They were raising their
insensible comrade in their arms, and coolly preparing
to throw him overboard, when, aware from their words
of their intentions, the condemned officer struck one of
them to the floor, and standing over the again pros-
trate drunkard, declared that while he lived he would
not see men who had sailed beneath the British flag
guilty of murder! The mutineers paused, touched
probably by this generous defence of a foe-for the
insensible seaman had been peculiarly bitter against
the officers and after a muttered oath or two they left
the cabin.
6
The lieutenant remained alone with his disgusting
and unwelcome visitant, and the two hours following
he described as the most painful of his life. It was less
the fear of death than the destined mode of it which
tortured him: not that he was insensible or indifferent
to the blessing of life, for he was by nature of a happy,
joyous temperament, and fair prospects of advancement
were before him; but in war-time' existence was held
on such a precarious tenure that the idea of death in
battle would scarcely have troubled his equanimity.
Two hours waiting to be hanged, however, is a far
different trial for courage, and we have never read or
imagined anything more painful than the description
which the aged admiral gave us of that (to him) endless
period of time. As if to add to the horror of his
position, the silence on board was so great that it
appeared as if he could hear the pulsation of his own
heart, while the low snoring of the drunken man
struck with painful distinctness on his ear. At last
the bell struck the fatal hour, and steps were heard on
the ladder. His door opened; he rose prepared to
shew no symptoms of faltering courage, when the
leaders of the party advancing, told him that the
people had taken his case into consideration, and as
they believed he individually had no ill-feeling towards
them, and as he had recently given proof that he cared
for the men, they had changed his sentence from death
to flogging! He must therefore prepare to receive three
dozen on the following morning.'
My kinsman, with the ready humour that never
deserted him, returned thanks with mock gravity for
their clemency, and begged them to carry his compli-
ments to the gentlemen who sent them, and assure
them that he could not have believed he should ever
have felt so much satisfaction at the prospect of a
whipping. The men, always susceptible of fun,
laughed. From that moment he was safe! Falstaff
wisely despairs of gaining the love of Prince John,
'because he could not make him laugh;' the young
lieutenant acted as if he possessed Shakspeare's know-
ledge of human nature when he awoke by his jest the
slumbering sympathies of the sailors. He was detained
a prisoner, but no further notice was taken of the
threatened flogging.
The mutiny subsided on the 16th of May, when
parliament passed an act to raise the seamen's wages,
and the royal pardon was bestowed on the mutineers;
not, however, before some sacrifice of human life had
ensued, as Admiral Colpoys, on the recommencement
of the mutiny on board the London, had ordered the
marines to fire on the people, and three seamen fell.
The funeral of these unfortunates was described to us
as a singularly-impressive and touching spectacle.
The townspeople were fearful of some violence or riot
on the part of the sailors when they landed to bury
their dead, and consequently closed their shutters and
retired into their houses. The mournful procession
moved therefore through deserted and silent streets on
its way to the village churchyard, in which the victims
were to be interred. But there was no cause for alarm.
The men walked silently and solemnly, two and two,
after their slain comrades, a stern, quiet sorrow, legible
on their weather-beaten faces; and nothing could
exceed the reverence and propriety of their conduct
beside the grave. It is a quiet, pretty village church-
yard in which these most pardonable rebels have their
resting-place, not far from which is the large grave
where three hundred bodies of those who perished in
the Royal George are buried.
One can scarcely forbear wondering at the little real
mischief which proceeded from this alarming mutiny.
It afforded, on the whole, a noble display of the prin-
cipal characteristics of the British scaman-the frolic-
spirit peculiar to him manifesting itself even when he
is most sadly and seriously in earnest. A captain of
marines, who was especially the object of the muti-
neers' aversion, was brought on shore by them, and
compelled to parade up the High Street to the 'Rogue's
March,' which was drummed before him. He was a
tall, gaunt old man, with a singularly long neck. The
day after his expulsion from his ship, the crew sent
a man to his house with a message, ordering him to
come on board again and be hanged!'
The unpo-
pular veteran sent back his compliments; but consi-
dering his throat unbecomingly long naturally, he did
not wish to have it stretched: he declined, therefore,
accepting their invitation.
The men went away
laughing. The people and the times were both extra-
ordinary!

HATCHING FISH BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS.
•
Among the Chinese, who are not so indifferent about
their fisheries as Englishmen appear to be, a curious
method of hatching fish by artificial means is very
extensively practised. The sale of spawn for this pur-
pose,' says Mr Martin, forms an important branch of
trade in China. The fishermen collect with care, on the
margin and surface of water, all the gelatinous matters
that contain spawn of fish, which is then placed in an
eggshell which has been fresh emptied, through a small
hole, which is then stopped, and the shell is placed under
a sitting fowl. In a few days the Chinese break the shell

are then kept in water until they are large enough to be
placed in a pond. This plan in some measure counteracts
the great destruction of spawn by troll-nets, which have
caused the extinction of many fisheries.'-United Counties
Miscellany. [Sir Francis Mackenzie of Gairloch has suc-
ceeded, by some process not yet made public, in assembling
a shoal of young salmon fry hatched in a pond during
spring, and ready, at the proper age, to be turned into
their ancestral river-the Ewe.]
CURIOUS SCENE AT SEA.
While a passenger from Aden to Bombay on board the
East India Company's steamer Queen, in December last,
it was our lot to fall short of coals; having had contrary
winds and a heavy sea nearly the whole distance, our
trip was prolonged to fourteen days, usually performed in
eight. The vessel had coaled in Aden only for ten days'
steam, and luckily she had besides a considerable quan-
tity of small coal or dross; but still it was found that it
would be absolutely necessary to burn part of the ship's
stores to bring her into harbour. Orders were accord-
ingly given to that effect, and it was with a kind of terror
mingled with surprise that we saw, one after another, the
facilitate its burning), the engine hatches, and the top-
long-boat, spare spars,. junk soaked in ghee and oil (to
masts, cut up and burned. Then came the turn of the
orlop deck, which was torn up from beneath our feet and
stuffed into the insatiable maw of the furnace; then
went the gun-slides, and then a number of packages of
government powder barrel heads and staves; and at
length rumours were rife among the seamen that their
sea-chests were to share the same fate. It would be
difficult to describe the feelings of the passengers, more
especially of the ladies, when looking on at the ship
thus being torn to pieces before their eyes, and when
listening throughout two sleepless nights to the noise of
sawing, and chopping, and throwing. It would be equally

difficult to describe the relief with which, on the fourteenth
morning, they beheld through the telescope, by the light of
the rising sun, a faint outline of the island of Bombay, the
harbour of which we duly reached. In explanation of this
extraordinary scene, I may mention that the instructions
of government insist peremptorily upon the commanders
of mail-steamers, in the event of the fuel running short,
burning anything and everything that will assist in
bringing the vessel to her destination.-Extract from a

It is near morning. Ere the next night fall
I shall be made a bride-Heaven's bride.
To my still marriage-chamber I shall come,
And spouseless, childless, watch the slow years crawl.
These lips will never meet a softer touch
Than the cold crucifix I kiss: no child
Will clasp this neck. Oh, Virgin-Mother mild,
Thy painted bliss will mock me overmuch!
This is the last time I shall twist the hair
My mother's hand wreathed, till in dust it lay:
The name-her name, given on my christening-day,
This is the last time I shall ever bear.
Oh weary world-Oh heavy life, farewell!
Like a tired child that creeps into the dark
To sob itself asleep where none can mark,
So creep I to my silent convent-cell.
Friends, lovers whom I loved not, kindly hearts,
Who grieve that I should enter this calm door,
Grieve not since closing softly evermore,
Me from all sorrows, as all joys, it parts.
Love, whom alone I loved! who stand'st far off
Lifting compassionate eyes that could not save,
Remember, this my spirit's serenest grave
Hides me from worldly pity, worldly scoff.
"Twas not thy hand but Heaven's that came between,
And dashed my cup down. See, I have no tears;
And if I think at all of vanished years,
'Tis but to bless thee for what joy has been.
My soul continually does cry to thee:
In the night-watches-ghostlike-stealing out
From its flesh-tomb and wandering thee about-
So live, that I in heaven thy face may see!'
Live, noble heart; of whom this heart of mine
Was all unworthy. Build up actions great,
That I, down-looking from heaven's crystal gate,
Smile o'er my dead hopes hid in such a shrine.
Live! keeping aye thy spirit undefiled;
That when we stand before our Master's feet,
I with an angel's love may crown complete
The woman's faith, the worship of the child.
Then thou shalt see no sorrow in these eyes;
And even their love, by God's great love subduel,
Shall never grieve thee with a pang too rude:
The incense-clouds have veiled the sacrifice,
Dawn, solemn bridal-morn! Ope bridal door!
I enter. My vowed soul may Heaven now take!
My heart, its virgin-spousal for thy sake,
Oh love! keeps sacred thus for evermore.

it then so? Kind friends who sit and sigh
While I lie smiling-is my life's sand run?
Will my next matins, hymned beyond the sun,
Mingle with those of saints and martyrs high?
Shall I, with these my gray hairs changed to gold,
These aged limbs enrobed in garments white,
Stand all transfigured in the angels' sight,
Hymning triumphantly that moan of old-
'Thy will be done.'-It was done. Oh my God,
Thou know'st, when over grief's tempestuous sea,
My broken-winged soul fled home to Thee,
I writhed, but murmured not beneath Thy rod.
It fell upon me, stern at first, then soft
As parents' kisses, till the wound was healed,
And I went forth a labourer in Thy field-
They best can bind who have been bruised oft.
God, Thou wert pitiful! I came, heart-sore,
To drink Thy cup, because earth's cup ran dry ;
Thou slew'st me not for that impiety,
But mad'st Thy cup so sweet, I thirst no more.
I came for silence, dark, dull rest, or death:
Thou gavest instead life, peace, and holy toil':
My sighing lips from sin Thou didst assoil,
And fill with righteous thankfulness each breath.
Therefore I praise Thee, that Thou shut'st Thine ears
Unto my misery: did'st Thy will, not mine:
That through this length of days Thy hand divine
My feet from falling kept-mine eyes from tears.
Sisters, draw near! Hear my last words' serene:
When I was young I walked in mine own ways,
Worshipped-not God; sought not alone His praise :'
So He cut down my gourd while it was green.
And then He o'er me threw His holy shade,
That, though no other earthly plants might grow,
Mocking the glory which was laid so low,
I dwelt in peace, and what He willed, obeyed.
I thank Him for that joy, and for its pain:
For healed pangs, for years of calm content:
For blessedness of spending and being spent
In His high service where all loss is gain.
I thank Him for my life and for my death;
But most, that in my death my life is crowned,
Since I see there, with augels gathering round,
My Angel-Ay, love, thou hast kept thy faith-
I mine. The golden portals will not close
Like those of earth, between us. Reach thy hand!
-No Miserere,' sisters! Chant out grand
'Te Deum laudamus !'--Now-'tis all repose!
ECONOMY IN CANDLES.
If you are without a rushlight, and would burn a
candle all night, unless you use the following precaution
it is ten to one an ordinary candle will gutter away in an
hour or two, sometimes to the endangering the safety of
the house. This may be avoided by placing as much
common salt, finely powdered, as will reach from the
tallow to the bottom of the black part of the wick of a
partly-burnt candle, when, if the same be lit, it will burn
very slowly, yielding a sufficient light for a bed-chamber :'
the salt will gradually sink as the tallow is consumed,
the melted tallow being drawn through the salt, and
consumed in the wick.-The Economist.

POSITION OF WOMEN.
THERE is a strange, muddling, under-current of
opinion, which occasionally gurges up to the surface,
and appears before respectable company, to the effect
that women are not done justice to by men; in so far as
they are not allowed the same political privileges, and
are excluded from several professions. The movement
has hitherto been most conspicuous in America, where
there have been one or two conventions of females for
the purpose of issuing declarations, and taking other
measures for the purpose of obtaining the rights assumed
to be withheld by the opposite sex. Even in this
country, where there is usually a soberer feeling towards
novel views, there are some writers who seriously avow
their belief that it is right and fitting for women to
intermingle in politics, and to contribute their votes
along with men at all elections, and who can foresee
no impropriety whatever in inviting women into every
profession for which, they may conceive themselves to
be fitted. It will readily occur to most people, as a
serious difficulty in the way of granting them common
electoral rights, that in nearly every part of our empire
they would in that case outvote the sterner sex, there
happening to be 800,000 more women in the island of
Great Britain than men. We refer, however, to this
merely as a jest, for the other objections are so over-
whelming as to require no such aid to make them hold
with the rational part of society.
It is either blindly overlooked or perversely ignored
by the arguers for women's rights, that nature has, in
the very first place, given women a different physio-
logical constitution, and therefore a different social
destiny from men. There never could be any true
political equality between the sexes; and even their
legal rights can scarcely be equal, simply because they
are naturally unequal. It might be more polite to say
they are different; but we shall still prefer the honest,
downright course of saying they are unequal.
A late writer on the side of the Women's Rights' |
Movement was content to do no more on this point
than to quote a passage from the writings of Sydney
Smith A great deal has been said of the original
difference of capacity between men and women, as if
women were more quick and men were more judicious
-as if women were more remarkable for delicacy of
sensation, and men for stronger powers of attention.
All this, we confess, appears to us very fanciful. That
there is a difference in the understandings of the men
and the women we every day meet with, everybody,
we suppose, must perceive; but there is none, surely,
which may not be accounted for by the difference of
circumstances in which they have been placed, without

about in the dirt and trundle, hoops together, they are
both perfectly alike. If you catch up one-half of these
creatures, and train them in a particular set of actions
and opinions, and the other half to a perfectly opposite
set, of course their understandings will differ, as one or
the other sort of occupations has called this or that talent
into action. There is surely no occasion to go into any
deeper or more abstruse reasoning in order to explain
so very simple a phenomenon.'
Now, in the first place, we never could be content
to rest so great a question as this upon the opinion of
Sydney Smith or any other man, as to the mere mental
organisation of the sexes. In the second, we deny that
the opinion of the reverend canon of St Paul's is right.
We appeal to every father of a family who has had
both sons and daughters, and to every teacher who
has had both boys and girls in his charge, if he did
not observe a substantial difference in the mental
organisation of the sexes. We have put the question
to hundreds, and never did we fail to get for answer
that boys are from the earliest period of infancy dif-
ferent from girls, and require a different kind of
management. In truth, it is so notorious a fact among
those who judge from experience, that we cannot look
but with a kind of pity on a writer avowing an
opinion so heterodox to the simplest principles of
mental science. It is indeed true that the human mind
is the same thing in the two sexes; and it is not less
true that there is more intellectual power in some
women than in some men. How a Mrs Somerville,
for instance, downweighs a whole load of common
men! But these particulars are nothing to the pur-
pose. We must take women in general against men
in general; and we must consider not merely the
amount of intellectual acuteness or force which may
be in the two sexes respectively, but the entire female
character against the entire masculine character."
What is so striking to those who have really entitled
themselves by observation to speak on this subject is,
that while the girl may learn her lessons as fast as
her brother, and speak on most subjects as much to
the purpose, she is in her entire character a softer and
weaker being. The boy is rough, difficult to control,
adventurous, self-dependent, obdurate this as a rule:
of course there are exceptions. The girl is at the same
time found gentle, docile, timorous, submissive: this
also as a rule, fully admitting that it fails in particular
instances. We have heard numberless parents of fami-
lies declare that they could more easily manage six
girls than two boys. In attributing the difference
usually observable to the boys and girls being trained

to a particular set of actions and opinions, Sydney
Smith has only pronounced himself, to our appre-
hension, as ignorant of the whole matter. The idea
deserves only to be ranked with that of certain philo-
sophers who have gravely argued we believe it has
been argued several times from the days of Plato
downwards-that there is no native difference of talent
or disposition in men, and that all the differences seen
in their mature days are the effect of education. From

deplore the unnatural vacuity in which women are left,
and the hardships to which they are often exposed
from the difficulty of procuring a means of indepen-
dent subsistence without a sacrifice of their position in
society. But we believe that these are evils which
the progress of society, and nothing else, will cure.
Humanity and refinement are extending every day
through the mass of the people. Generous, forbearing,
and protective feelings towards women must, in the
course of things, supersede much of the reckless levity
and the unworthy sensuality with which the softer
sex are now regarded. An improved morale will
enable women to venture into spheres of exertion which
they cannot now safely approach. In the meantime,
if women are injured by the public opinion which
prevents them from entering upon various occupations,
we must lay the evil to the charge of the public
morality and civilisation, which is not yet competent
entirely to protect them.
We cannot stop to adduce proofs in support of our
view; but we have no doubt that the great mass of
sensible and reflecting men will support us in assuming
that it is on the whole correct. If it be so, it takes
all plausibility away from the claim put forward for
women, that they ought to be excluded from no privi-
lege which is enjoyed, and no profession which is open
to the opposite sex. Public life and all its concerns
require those qualities of resolution and reflection in The advocates of what are called Women's Rights

comfort from the consideration that it will continually
improve.
On the one hand, it must be admitted that the enforced
idleness in which a great number of women belonging
to the middle classes are kept, by reason of the scruples
which forbid their entering into any kind of busi-
ness which brings them in contact with the public,
is an evil under the sun, and one which is attended
by many bad effects. On the other hand, the lady
who is confined to the retirement of elegant domestic
life possesses a charm which most people would think
poorly exchanged for the fruits of any professional
activity she could exert, attended as these would
necessarily be by more or less damage to that fine
moral enamel which is so highly appreciated. Here
we think there is some room for debate. It may be
fairly questioned whether the refinement of the retired
lady is not bought at too high a price-whether the
evils apprehended from a freer intercourse with the
world are not less than those which actually arise from
the vacancy of thought resulting from a harem-like
seclusion. We, for our own part, are most ready to

PEOPLE who have been employed in official situations

engaged for the most part on the side of power; and it
is curious to observe the exclusion from their narratives
of all moral reflections, of all positive opinions, and,
above all, of that natural indignation which the contem-
plation of uncalled-for cruelty arouses in the majority

attempt to satisfy their own consciences. They try to

responsibility attaches than to the motions of a steam-
engine. A consciousness of some fallacy in this theory
lurks of course in their mind, but it rarely betrays
itself in language, though not unfrequently in an un-
easy manner, and a scrutinising look at the face of the
listener. The following anecdote is told in the words
of one of the Frank secretaries of the celebrated Boghos
Bey, chief minister of Mohammed Ali, late viceroy of
Egypt.
I was sitting one day in the private office arranging
some, papers, and waiting the arrival of my principal,
when a rapid dialogue in the outer room, the doorway
of which was covered by a curtain, drew my attention.
Both voices spoke in Arabic-the loudest in a tone of
passionate entreaty, scarcely justified by the indifferent
objections urged by the other against an invasion of
the privacy of my apartment. I was in the act of
clapping my hands, when the curtain was thrust
hastily aside, and a person dressed in the European
style entered, followed by a black slave expostulat-
ing, as in duty bound, on the intrusion. The new-
comer looked surprised and annoyed at seeing me, and
muttered something about its being of the greatest
consequence to him to have an interview with his
excellency. I begged him to be seated, and wait for
half an hour; dismissed the slave; and proceeded with
the arrangement of the papers. Properly speaking, I
should have inquired his name and business; but so
great and evident was his agitation, that I thought it
best to allow him some time to recover. He threw
himself on a divan, and endeavoured to appear calm,
but without success. From time to time I cast a
glance towards him, and gradually felt my curiosity
and interest increase. He was a young man, not more
than two-and-twenty years old, and of marked Oriental
physiognomy. I could not, however, make out to what
race he belonged-such delicate and expressive features
being found in nearly equal proportions amongst Turks,
Arabs, and Levantines of various classes, without being
common everywhere. He was dressed rather elegantly
in the Parisian style; and the more I observed him the
more I was struck by the contrast between the general
polish of his manner and the uneasy cowering expres-
sion that occasionally flashed across his features. It is
due to my sagacity to say, that I arrived at last at the
conclusion that he was an Eastern slave in the disguise
of a European gentleman.
The meaning was evident enough. Poor Fadlallah
wanted to be forgiven, to be taken again into favour,
or at anyrate allowed permission to join his family-
wealthy people in Cairo. He spoke a long time, and
said some eloquent things; but it was evident that his
protracted residence in Europe had caused his views of
the state of Egypt to differ considerably from the
truth: and when he two or three times based his hopes
of pardon on the fact which he had read in news-
papers, that Mohammed Ali was now the father of his
people,' I could see a smile, half- satirical half-con-
temptuous, play for an instant round the thin lips of
my sagacious master. When the appeal was concluded,
I began to suggest some questions; but the bey inter-
rupted me, saying: 'There are three facts ascertained:
Fadlallah has disobeyed orders, has claimed foreign
protection, and has embraced Christianity-fatal, un-
pardonable acts; on the other hand, he has trusted in
the clemency of his highness. We shall see whether
that trust be well founded."
Fadlallah was handed over, not exactly to my cus-
tody, but to my care; and he was advised rather than
ordered to keep the room allotted to him next to mine.
He had probably expected to be sent to prison, or at
least to have a sentinel placed at his door, and augured
well from the omission of these precautions. For my
own part I scarcely knew what to think, and could not
refrain, the first time I was alone with the bey, from
asking what his real opinion was. But he at once
checked my inquisitiveness, and rather roughly turned
to another subject. This was enough for me; and
considering that, after all, I had no particular reason
for feeling an interest in this young man, I contented
myself with quoting the highest result of Oriental
philosophy: 'God is merciful. What is decreed will
come to pass.' It is astonishing of what vast utility
this doctrine proves in the East, even to us Europeans.
There is scarcely any other justification to an honest
man for remaining in these countries; certainly there
is no other preservation for the sensitive man from
despondency and despair. Fortunately everything,
even the climate, seems to inculcate its truth and
necessitate its adoption. Practical fatalism is the
growth of these hot and dreamy latitudes.
Nevertheless I could not but feel some interest in
the fortunes of young Fadlallah; and though he was
melancholy, and at first averse to society, in two or

it was a hopeless case disclosed itself in my look, for
the young man, seemingly anxious to collect all
opinions, bent his eyes intently upon me when he saw
me start, and then, burying his face in his hands, wept
like a child.
The case was this: Fadlallah was one of the young
men who had been sent for education to Europe. He
formed part of the Leghornese College, and I knew that
various very unfavourable reports upon his conduct
had been forwarded by the superintendent; and that,
in fact, some time previously, it had been announced
that he had not only broken the bounds but turned
Christian, and claimed protection from the native
authorities. This was an unpardonable offence; and
for him voluntarily to throw himself into the hands of
the Egyptian government appeared to me to be sheer
madness. Possibly his excellency thought as I did,

'I will make inquiries,' I said.
Pshaw! I know she does. You ought to know it
too,' replied the bey peevishly, and motioning to me to
retire.
His meaning was now evident. I went to join my
new friend Fadlallah, and with as much gentleness as
possible told the news. He listened over and over
again to the paragraph, read it himself, and so far from
entertaining any sinister apprehensions, believed that

After supper he asked me if there was any objec-
tion to his walking out to enjoy the evening air. I
saw none, and proposed to accompany him. We went
forth together, and soon found ourselves of the then
deserted beach of the Cape of Figs, between the castle
of the Pharos and the lighthouse. The moon had
already run the g greater
part of her course, and sloped
her yellow beams over a broad extent of dancing waves
that came to break in flashes of melancholy light
amidst ruined barrier of rocks that nature has
extended to protect the shore. The massive forms of
the palace and its attendant buildings were nearly
buried in gloom; but the white houses of the Turkish
town clustering at the base of the promontory shewed
in fantastic and spectral beanty in the distance. These
objects, however, were visible only for awhile. We
soon went down close to the water's edge, and could
see nothing but a dim bank on one hand, and on the
other, as I have said, the shadowy sea, from which ever
and anon gleams of light seemed to arise.
It is not often that I feel the effect of external
nafure on m
my spirits; but there are times when, if I
may so express myself, my individuality is not on the
watch, and I suffer certain scenes and outward objects
to play their own time upon my mind." Not that I
believe there is any nystical communion on such occa-
sions more than on others between man and nature,
but our attention not being particularly directed to
some absorbing topic, physical impressions do not
merely beat against the senses, but carry their vibra-
tions as it were into the centre of our being. Probably
it was the combined result of previous intellectual
fatigue, of the confined prospect, the imperfect light,
and the cold, damp wind that blew, as well as of some
childish association between the confused rustling
sound of the waves, and the idea of fear-possibly
an undue solicitude about the fate of one who really
had no particular claims on my interest; but I must
confess, that after we had walked to and fro for
about twenty minutes, I fell into a horrible state of
despondency and mental discomfort, felt myself shiver-
ing, and could not resist the inclination every now and
then to look over my shoulder. A medical man has
informed me that had it not been for a violent shock I
subsequently received, the consequences sooner or later
might have been a severe fever."
I am not the man, however, to yield tamely to such
a defeat. I resolved to rally and regain lost ground, and
accordingly entered into conversation with Fadlallah,
and by degrees persuaded him to give me an account
of some of his adventures, and of the motives which
had led him in the first place to quit the college, and
which had now induced him to put himself once more
in the power of an irate master. He seemed rather
eager than otherwise to satisfy my curiosity, and told
me his whole history-how he had been taken very
young from his parents, and sent to Leghorn; how he
had studied with enthusiasm, and become an adept in
the learning of the Franks; how he had expected to
astonish the Egyptian world on his return by the bril-
the spirit of its civilisation, if that word can without
derision be applied in such a case. His ideas were
entirely European: there was nothing Oriental in
him, except that fear of superior power, and that
absolute acquiescence in its decrees; that cringing hope
of favour, and that impotence of immagining an escape
from wrath which I had noticed when I first saw him,
and which was made still more manifest by his un-
willingness to entertain for a moment seriously the
proposition I had that night made to him not to depend
on a doubtful clemency, but to gird up his loins, and fly
for his life and liberty.

About a couple of years before his return he had
gone to Pisa; and there, in a season of unexampled
happiness, his errors and misfortunes took their rise.
Having visited the Campo-Santo, the Cathedral, and
the Leaning Tower, in company with several com-
panions, he had strayed alone down a long and silent
street, partly overgrown with grass, and flanked by
houses which seemed to be dreaming of centuries past,
and to take no note of the present time. At the farther
end was a garden surrounded by a low, half-ruined
wall and the remnants of an iron paling, behind which,
forming a better defence, rose a hedge of solid green.
A number of trees -as willows, lilacs, acacias, and
others drooped, moreover, their green and purple and
golden tresses overhead, and flung fragmentary shadows
on the pavement without the ruined wall. Fadlallah
went up to the gate, attracted by these cheerful objects,
and finding it ajar, with true Eastern familiarity
entered, and sitting down by a quaint fountain on a
rickety beneh, very soon fell into such a state of trance,
that he fancied himself in the gardens of Shoubra, or
perhaps in those of Paradise itself. The latter imagi-
nation might have been encouraged by a sight which
presently appeared, and disturbing his unsubstantial
reverie, gave his waking senses something to feed upon.
This was a young girl who issued forth from the door
of a house, which, I had forgotten to say, stood at the
bottom of the garden, and came slowly in the direction
of Fadlallah's resting-place. His presence was not
soon observed, partly because the new-comer was occu-
pied in watching the progress of a variety of shrubs
and flowers, planted probably by her hand, partly
because the willow-tree under which the young man
sat threw its drooping branches around him in a kind
of natural screen.Boka údo
b
I will not attempt to repeat the rapturous enco-
miums which Fadlallah bestowed on the beauty of this
young girl. By a not unnatural consequence of an
education in opposition to his temperament, he spoke of
her in terms of incoherent admiration now as an
angel, now as a houri; now almost materialising her
into the sultana of a harem, now subtilising her into a
spirit. Suffice it to say that he loved her not with the
feeble, squeamish affection which boys call love, and
which young ladies, with truer taste, call inclination,'
but with that passionate, all-absorbing love of which
we read in romances, and which I have no doubt is
sometimes felt by natures of mingled tenderness and
ferocity. For my part I never experienced more than
a gentle friendship for any woman, and can with as
much difficulty put myself in the position of the im-
passioned Fadlallah as in that of a raving madman.
I can understand better the delight with which
he saw her draw near-now seeming to be a dim
shade beneath the trees, now a ray of sunshine more
bright and tangible than the others. Standing on
that dark and desolate beach, Fadlallah raised his
voice above the hoarse lashing of the waves, and told
with garrulous enthusiasm how his vision of beauty
came on now stopping to trim a plant, now to gaze at
an exquisite flower; sometimes streaming slowly on in
one of the pensive reveries of youth, sometimes trip-

The path wound, and the view was sometimes, inter
cepted by a clump of trees. More than once, as the
young girl lingered behind one of these, Fadlallah
feared that she had changed her intention of advancing,
and had gone back or turned aside; but at length she
came to the opposite front of the fountain, and observ-
ing a stranger, stood for a moment in an attitude of
surprise and confusion. Fadlallah's presence of mind
seemed not to have deserted him in his admiration.
Ile spoke, apologised for his intrusion, praised the
garden, and said something of the beauty of its mistress.
Her answers were brief and apposite; but she was too
timid to enter into a regular conversation, and Fadlallah
was beginning to feel that he was prolonging his intru-
sion beyond reasonable limits, when an old gentleman,
who had been approaching unobserved by him in a
different direction, made his appearance, earsted
I leave you to work up a romance out of this nar-
rative if you please. For my part, I shall adhere
exactly to truth. The okl gentleman was Count,
the head of a noble, family reduced almost to poverty,
and scarcely able to continue inhabiting the large
mansion of his fathers. The garden was tended by his
own hands and those of his daughter Fenella; and in
spite of their aristocratic origin they were both very
simple, nay, humble people, except when one or two
hereditary prejudices were brought into play. You

shortly Fadlallah played the truant; remained a fort-

Contrived to construct a plausible excuse; and of course,
-after a brief period, he started off to Pisa again with-
out permission. One or two escapades of this kind pro-
duced a threat from the superintendent that he should
be sent back to Egypt; upon which he openly rebelled,
acorned all authority, and absented himself entirely
from the school. He obtained a little money by selling
some jewels and weapons he possessed, and naturally

13 Whether from a conscientious motive, or from a
desire to produce a decisive impression on a somewhat
paperstitious mind, he was led to confess to being a
1
Moslem, and to express a desire of f conversion. He
solemnly and publicly abjured his religion, and adopted
that of the delighted Fenella. Soon he openly de-
clared himself her suitor, was accepted, and looked
forward to being speedily united with the object of his
love. His means, however, were drawing to a close,
and he was ashamed to confess falsehood he had
originally uttered about his wealth. He wrote to his
family in Egypt, but received no answer - all his
letters being intercepted in our office; and at length,
in a fit of rash confidence, or under the irresistible im-
pulse of fate, went down to Leghorn and again entered
into communication with the Egyptian agents. These
persons, it appears, considered it to be of paramount
importance that
that an example should be made of him, and
adopted very unjustifiable means; such as stating that
the pacha had expressed benevolent intentions towards
him, to induce him to go on board an Egyptian fri-
gate that happened to be in the harbour. Thus he had
come to Alexandria, entertaining high hopes of for-
giveness, but determining in his own mind that when
he could lay hands on a certain sum of money he would
again make his escape, and return to claim the hand
of Fenella, A letter to the count had already ex-
plained that sudden business had called him back to his
country; and he had prepared a very beautiful and
probable story for his return to the effect that he had
been driven from his dominious by a rival prince, and
had only escaped with a small sum of money.
Laying aside all prudential considerations, I re-
paid this story by overthrowing every hope expressed
by poor Fadlallah, during its relation, and earnestly
besought him to accompany me at once down to the
old port, where I could easily get a boat at any time of
the night, and I engaged in half an hour to put him on
board the bark Otho He seemed staggered by my
serious tone, and asked me in a very trembling voice
what the usual punishment of such disobedience as he
had been guilty of might be. He did not understand
that the most important charge was the change of reli-
gion; and when I mentioned the galleys for life, or
perhaps, death, he laughed; but it was an uneasy,
fearful laugh, representing the strange, and terrible
ideas that were arising amidst his reverie of love like
a huge loathsome snake rearing its head above a beau-
tiful bed of flowers. He told me then, in a few rapid,
pathetic phrases, such as, I have heard, no other man
pronounce, how his whole soul was wrapped up in
Fenella; and how he feared death only because it would
cause a separation between him and her. Then certain
doubts and anxieties, shook his mind, but they were
expressed in disconnected, sentences; and I could only
guess that his soul was rising towards that delirium
which it only attains when earth seems to have broken
all its bright and glorious promises, and heaven, closing
in its marble vault, sternly shuts out the golden vista
of futurity, and coldly echoes back the shout of agony
which scepticism and despair hurl up against it.

Nothing but the patrol, I said; let us remain close
down by the water's edge. They will pass along the

cross the promontory to the boat, and you shall go

greater utility, be substituted.
He was talking in this strain when the torches
reached abreast of us and suddenly came to a halt. It
was the patrol; but with them was the terrible Billal
Aga, governor of Alexandria, whose presence under
such circumstances always told of vengeance and blood.
I had nothing to fear for myself, but my whole frame
trembled. I could not utter a single word, but stood
by gasping whilst that tragic scene took place. It
passed rapidly like a hideous phantom borne on the
wings of a tempest-dream. Not a sound but the hoarse
murmur of the waves disturbed the air-no cry of
menace, no shriek of terror. The Billal Aga stood
forth, and on the lofty, pure brow of that unhappy youth,
who only drew himself up as if recovering his dignity
at the last moment, the deadly mace rushed like a
sledge-hammer. An expressive sign commanded the
head to be severed from the body; then the corpse was
thrust into a sack ready prepared; and presently I saw
two soldiers in their white uniforms staggering along a
projecting ledge like two dim spectres, with the surf
rushing about their feet, and the glare of the torches
flashing feebly and more feebly upon their forms. A
heavy splash, awfully distinet, came at length to my
ear; the two soldiers returned; the patrol, which had
stood impassively looking on, resumed their marching
order; the Billal Aga smiled one ferocious smile; and
away they swept along the solitary beach, watched
alone by me until the blood-red gleam of the torches
lighted up the gloomy walls of a mass of ruined houses,
and then disappeared.
The narrator paused, endeavouring to regain his
composure. But he afterwards added, that he had
written an account of this tragic occurrence to Fenella's
father. No answer ever came; and thus we must re-
main ignorant whether Fadlallah was remembered as
he deserved to be, or whether the love he had inspired
was buried with him in the hungry waves.
Having seen thus imperfectly the exterior, you cross
the dimly-lighted corridor, and as soon as your eyes
have recovered from the sudden change of the light of
day for that of gas, you see that you are standing on a
small circular floor at the bottom of a huge sphere, the
whole interior of which is occupied by a series of floors
or galleries about ten feet apart, giving one the idea
of a dumb waiter on an extraordinary scale. Casting
an eye upwards at the margin, you see that they
increase in dimensions as they approach the centre of
the sphere, and leave a clear space all round of about
three feet in width. Thus from each floor a view of a
zone of the globe some ten feet in width is obtained.
The globe is about sixty feet in diameter - that is,
twenty times the diameter of the largest yet made-and
about the seven-hundred-thousandth part of the real
diameter of our earth. It is of course impossible to
get a complete view at once of the surface of the globe
from the galleries; but as you ascend, numerous gas-
lights, so disposed as to be hidden from the visitors,
throw a brilliant illumination upon each portion of the
concave surface on which the earth is delineated.
It was at first intended to represent the earth on the
exterior of the globe, but the objections to such a plan
were so numerous and obvious that it was abandoned,
and the interior was chosen; so that the visitor, though
inside the earth, must suppose himself viewing it from
the outside. The representation belongs exclusively to
physical geography-that is to say, it is not broken up
or varied by the divisions of countries, by lines of lati-
tude and longitude, or by names. The horizontal or
plane surface is represented on a scale of one inch to
ten miles, while the vertical is on three times that scale.
Thus a mountain is shown three times larger in pro-
portion than a plain. Had the proportions been the
same, the elevations on the surface would have appeared
so small as to be almost imperceptible. Even on this
larger scale, the highest mountain-ranges appear at a
very small elevation above the general surface, giving
the spectator the most perfect realisation of a fact
hitherto so imperfectly illustrated by the 'protuberances
on the rind of an orange.' The snow-line of the moun-
tains is beautifully delineated by a white incrustation
that sparkles in the gas-light, just as the snow on the
real mountains may be supposed to sparkle in the
beams of the rising sun. The volcanoes are all repre-
sented in a state of eruption, their peaks being painted
a fiery red, and surmounted by a little cotton-wool,
teased out very fine, to represent smoke. The rivers

gas-light), and a better idea of the vast magnificence of
the Pacific Ocean it is impossible to obtain than from
one of the galleries, where nothing can be seen but a
vast expanse of water, that seems a sea without a
shore, dotted here and there by those
J
Flow'ry islets that do lie
Calm beneath a Pacific sky,?
Pursuing the route we took from the bottom, we
perceive the blue expanse of the South Atlantic, South
Pacific, and Antarctic Oceans; nothing but water,
water everywhere,' till you come to the southern extre-
mity of America, comprising part of Patagonia, Terra
del Fuego, and the islands, one of which forms the
redoubted Cape Horn. With the exception of the
Falklands and the desolate isle of Georgia there is no
other land to be seen, as the floor fills the space
in which would appear the more southern lands-the
antarctic continent, with its mighty volcanoes. While
wondering at the apparent insignificance of the land in
comparison with the vast extent of water around it,
you mount by a convenient stair to the first floor, and
see in the upper part of the zone which it discloses the
Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land, a corner of
New Holland, New Zealand, and some of the smaller
islands, while a broad patch of South America, from Val-
paraiso to the mouth of the La Plata, with its rivers,
hills, and pampas, presents an interesting study. The
sense of disappointment felt on first entering now dis-
appears the place seems lighter, the land assumes a
distincter relief, and a growing interest in the object
around takes possession of you. Another stair: there
is Madagascar, our little island of Mauritius, and a
good portion of the terra incognita of Africa. Crossing
the occan you come to Australia, its whole solid form
taken in at one view; and commencing with the ocean
beyond, there are the numberless islands that enliven
its surface. Measuring the distance between Africa
and South America with your eye, it is easily seen that
Cabral could not help discovering Brazil: the wonder
would have been had he missed it. Here, too, are the
highest peaks of the Andes, and the mighty region
drained by the Amazon and its affluents.
Mount again: the broadest scope of Africa is before
you from the Cape de Verds to the Red Sea. There
seems something awful in such an extent of unknown
territory! Lake Tchad and the Niger are conspicuous
on the left; and on the right the Nile, flowing through
old hushed Egypt,' at sight of which the wonders of
Scripture history recur to the mind, and the whole
region becomes invested with a solemn and touching
interest. There is besides the Overland Route, on such
a scale as to convey a positive idea to the mind. Con-
tinuing eastward, Ceylon and a portion of the Indian
and Malayan peninsulas come into view, and the
Eastern Archipelago large and distinct; and far away
in the ocean is Hawaii-so small and so solitary, that
its ever having been discovered seems almost marvel-
lous. Presently you reach the American isthmus, and
may form your opinion as to the rival routes across it
by way of Panama or Tehuantepec. There, too, are
Mexico, the West Indies, the great basin from which
issues the Gulf stream, and the vast valley and stream
of the Mississippi.
Up of
once more to the topmost gallery. Here you
are as much struck by the prodigious extent of land
as you were below by that of water; and to this part
you will perhaps devote more attention than to any
other. Immediately overhead is the Arctic Sea. Or
you can cross Behring's Straits, and trace the course of
Russian discovery along the desolate shores of the
Asiatic continent. The United States from Massa-
chusetts to California are in full view the great lakes,
Niagara, the St Lawrence, and the Canadas.
To any one unacquainted with geography the great
globe proves a disappointment; but an informed mind
on viewing it may learn much, and in a most interest-
ing way. Concrete ideas of geography may here be
obtained in place of those abstract notions concerning
the earth and its surface which mere reading often
creates; while for comparing positions, and remarking
what places lie opposite each other or on the same
parallel, this globe affords peculiar facilities. It has
been suggested that by carrying round a few red and
blue tapes close to the surface, the lines of equal heat
and equal magnetism might be represented without
confusing the general view.
A few words on the construction of this remarkable
work. The concave surface of the globe is composed
of casts taken in plaster-of-Paris, each cast being about
three feet square, and about an inch in thickness, or
more when it is of a mountainous district. These casts
are screwed on to a series of beams, somewhat like
barrel-staves, and then neatly joined. Their number
is said to be about 6000. Three operations were neces-
sary after the correct draught had been made on paper:
First, a model had to be made in clay; then from it a
mould was formed, which again produced the cast.
Now, when it is considered that all these separate casts
must not only join to each other with perfect accuracy,
like the sheets of a map, but must also have each its
peculiar curve, so that all may form a perfectly concave
surface, some idea may be formed of the vast amount
of patient labour and skill that have been expended on
the work, and the formidable difficulties that have been
overcome. The surface was of course not painted until
after the casts had been fixed, and this again must
have proved a task of great difficulty.
T
AN EVENING BY THE ISIS.
Ir is just past six o'clock on an evening in May,
and the last of the hall-divers are lounging across
quad.' The scouts have already nearly folded the
clothis, and you see them passing out laden with the
plates and tankards, or chatting by the buttery-door in
eager anticipation of to-night's boat-race; for they are
almost as sensitive as their young masters to the
honour of upholding their place upon the river-not
to mention the sundry bets the more adventurous
have staked upon their boat, and the bright hope of
sharing the glory of success in the shape of foaming
ale.
There is a sound of merry voices; and on looking up
you see half-reclining on the window-seat a few out-
lying' members of a wine-party that is going on inside.
'Holloa, S - where are you off to? Here! we
want you!'
'No, no! come here; I am off for the river: I like
to be down early to watch all that's going on before
the race. Get your beaver, and come along!'
Very well; stop a moment,' is the reply; and in
five minutes we are sauntering arm in arm in the
direction of the river.
Already what crowds are pouring towards Christ-
church Meadows. Look at them as they go-men,
women, and children; young and old; tradespeople,
townsfolk, strangers, gownsmen, dons; the lately-
plucked, the expectant classman; fast men and slow;
the money-lending Jew, the indefatigable dun, debtor,
creditor; maid-servant, mistress; stable-men and bil-
liard-markers-pressing alike eager to the scene of
action. Here a college messenger' hastening to the
barge with his master's hat or tie; and there a crew
with their bright-ribboned straw-hats and 'flannels.'
How proudly they press on, as if the glances they
attract as they pass by were theirs of right! And well
they may, for they are each and all fine specimens of
the spirited and open-hearted boating-man.
And now we have turned in through the big doors
opposite the livery-stables, and are in the lane, thronged
from one end to the other, that leads from St Aldate's

their place. Meanwhile the different crews, in various
moods of despondency or gaiety, are hanging about the
barges of the different colleges; either their own or
hired for the term: some with their coats on, others
stripped, and giving orders for the alteration of
strutcher or a row-lock; some securing small bags of
powdered resin for their hands, so as to give them a
firmer hold of their oar; others conversing with their
friends who are lingering by them till the last moment
to keep up their pluck, and who, promise to be down
to start them; and others again 'chailing a rival crew,
or consulting with an interested or friendly waterman

There are some loungers with their spruce, dress and
massive chains, their rings and dandy-canes, their
summer coats, white, hats, and contemptuous eyes
glasses, Jisping as affectedly as if the whole world
were made for their pleasure, and nothing ever could
arise to disturb their equanimity. There go by a
laughing trio, along the shore in a punt well-laid with
cushions; two with bare arms, and, as we have observed,
generally bright scarlet braces, are propelling alter-
nately and leisurely, as they step from stem to, stern
(if the ends of a punt are so distinguishable); their
indolent companion, who, in real Epicurean, Nile-lite
enjoyment, lounges so complacently on his soft couch,
calmly contemplating the sky, between the puffs of his
cigar, and occasionally nodding to or exchanging a
word with the parties as they pass them on the bank.

out a little longer their pursuers may flag; the pur-
suers in hope that their agony of intense exertion will
soon be over, and that they shall have an easy pull up.
A few are gasping faint in either boat.

Now pick her up! Only three strokes more!'

For shame "Three!" Beautiful stroke! Well-
pulled "Seven!" There, you'll have them; keep it

And thus for some way the rival boats proceed, the
Coxswain of the pursued doing all he can to wash off
the enemy by the stream from his rudder, which he
jerks suddenly a most suicidal plan, by the way, for
there is no real advantage gained and much ground
lost.
'There you'll have them!' And a perfect yell of
excitement rends the air. The crew thus stimulated,
respond to the cheers, and again put on the steam.'

din. The steersman of the first boat shaved the bank
too nearly; one oar grounded, and the bows caught
the stream, and were carried out too far.

Easy all!' And the two boats bear on their way
together for a few yards, the beak of the victor beneath

hopes and fears of the contest are at an end. The
crews are resting on their oars, or cautiously stepping
from their unsteady craft. Instead of the throng that
lined the shore just now, there are only the loiterers
below the bridges; the few who, although they liked
to see, took not sufficient interest in the race to run
along with the boats; or those who have turned down
to prolong their walk beside the river, or to watch the
University' go down. They are all heaped together,
opposite the barges, breathless with running, or dis-
cussing eagerly the merits of the race; scanning the
crews, as the boats lie waiting for their turn to go
alongside, or pushing in the direction of the ferry.
Let us go across to see what the result of the evening
is what boats have bumped, and which have lost their
place. But look!--there is a boat over. And so it
was. The St John's Eight had got entangled somehow,
either by running on too far, and getting under the
outrigger row-locks of another boat, or had been run
into herself. But there they were all in the water,
gasping and plunging-punts pushing towards them
a storm of cries upon the shore. The upset, however,
is close beside the barges; and, see! the coxswain, a
small man, has swum ashore.
But what means that roar of laughter? Surely it is
too serious a business for such mirth. The fun, however,
is soon explained. Number Five, a giant of a fellow,
gallantly following his coxswain's example, struck
manfully out for the shore, when lo! his knees grounded,
and now you see him, with his scanty and dripping
habiliments plastered on him, wading to the shore
amidst the fun and jokes of hundreds on the bank.
We will cross to King's barge to see the flags lowered.
What excitement at the ferry! How the punts, crammed
with men, clinging for safety to each other, are rocking
to and fro! They will certainly be over, How reck-
lessly the rival boatmen strike against each other!
And the punts swerve wildly to and fro, as they drive
them furiously in their anxiety to get across, that
they may be the first back for another load.
There go the flags! and the men of the different
colleges are cheering as the changes in their disposition
please.
Three cheers for Baliol!' and the air re-echoes.
'Brazennose!' and again the shouts strike the sky.

LETTERS OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.
ONE is not accustomed to contemplate this princess,
with her romantic and tragic history, as a person of
great industry. Yet that this must have been the fact,
has been established beyond all question by those
industrious investigators who have failed to establish
what they originally set about her innocence of any
connection with the death of her husband Darnley.
That her guilty accession has been proved by the few
who have taken up that side of the controversy it
would be harsh and dogmatic to assert. Where there
are so many zealous defenders ready to break a literary
lance for her reputation with all comers, it were pre-
sumption to maintain that they are under a miserable
delusion. Still those who are not enlisted by their
enthusiasm in the cause are slow to admit that the
evidence and arguments of the chivalrous counsel in
defence of outraged beauty have been entirely success-
ful-the question would lose all its romantic and excit-
ing interest if they were. But one thing, as we have
already said, and in itself a very interesting matter,
they have been successful in proving-that the beautiful
queen was a woman of great industry; we should also
say of great talent and varied accomplishment. Though
living in an age when writing was no common qualifi-
cation, and a command of the pen extremely rare, the
letters from her already in print would have entitled

her to be termed a prolific correspondent even in
Horace Walpole's days. There are but few letters
extant of her able and enterprising rival, Queen Eliza-
beth. Perhaps it may be said that she had other things
to do, and little time to give to correspondence, while
Mary had too much; but, on the other hand, poor Mary
spent a long period of her life in durance, when she
could only correspond by stealth and artifice, and had
often to use the circuitous medium of a cipher. The
extent to which, under all her difficulties, she managed
to blacken paper, may be conceived by an inspection of
the collection of her letters published at Paris in 1845
by the Russian prince, Alexander Labanoff.
6
The prince has proved himself the most truly disinte-
rested and romantic of all her chivalrous champions,
since even the vanity of literary distinction has not
been courted by him, and he has been content to hunt
the world for her letters, transcribe them, and accurately
put them in type. In the British Museum, the State
Paper Office, the Advocates' Library, the archives of the
Scottish Catholics; in the collection of several private
gentlemen; in the archives and libraries of Paris,
Rome, Vienna, Florence, and many others, did the
prince gather the objects of his search; and the result
was that he printed the 'Recueil des Lettres de Marie
Stuart' in seven well-filled octavo volumes-a goodly
correspondence for one person to indite. Whatever
expectations the minds of persons fresh from reading
Sir Walter Scott's novel of the Abbot' might form
about anything connected with the romantic history
of Queen Mary, the greater part of this collection is
dull enough. Many of the letters are on business; and
that they are chiefly written in antiquated French does
not make them more inviting. Some of them are of
course extremely interesting, as bearing on the more
striking parts of her history; but, as a whole, the
chief impression imparted by the collection is the
notion we have already referred to of Queen Mary's
industry. She appears to have had an active mind,
ever desiring something to occupy itself upon. Quan-
tities of needlework are shewn as the work of her
hands; and though much of it is perhaps spurious,
there must have been a considerable portion of it
genuine to set imitators at work. One letter, written
when in captivity at Sheffield, shews an earnest hanker-
ing for occupation:-'I have nothing else to tell you
except that all my exercise is to read and work in my
chamber; and therefore I beseech you, since I have no
other exercise, to take the trouble, in addition to the
rest, for which I thank you, to send me as soon as you
can four ounces more or less of the same crimson silk
which you sent me some time ago, similar to the
pattern which I send you. The safest way is to
inquire for it at the same merchant who provided you
with the other. The silver is too thick: I beg you will
choose it for me as fine as the pattern, and send it to
me by the first conveyance, with eight ells of crimson
taffeta for lining. If I have it not soon my work must
stand still, for which I shall be very vexed, as what I
am working is not for myself.'*
The most interesting of Queen Mary's letters to
inspect in autograph are certainly those which were
written in extreme youth, and are contained in the
Balcarras Collection of Papers in the Advocates'
Library. There are fourteen of these letters addressed
to her mother Mary of Guise, the queen-regent of
Scotland. They have been pronounced by critical
inquirers to be in the young queen's own handwriting,
all except two, and they must have been all written
ere she was fifteen years old. At what precise period
of her life the earliest one may have been written it
would be difficult to determine. Only two of them
have dates: that of the earlier is 23d June 1554. She
was born on the 8th December 1542. They are written
*Translation in Mr Turnbull's selection from Prince Labanoff.
with extreme clearness, each letter being finished by
itself. Their form is the modern written hand known
for a long time after her period as the Italian. Indeed
she must have been one of the first out of Italy who
employed it; for a sort of corruption of the old Gothic
form was used not only at that time, but for a century
and a half later. There is no misreading her words,
and any one with a tolerable knowledge of French will
be able to make out her letters in their antiquated
diction. The lines are long and straight, containing many
words; and, on the whole, the letters of this young girl
have a matured, almost manly air of systematic strength
which is very remarkable. The signature, Marie,' is
particularly large, square, and powerful. As an on-
looker remarked, it was more like that of a surveyor of
taxes or a messenger-at-arms than of an accomplished
high-born female; but it has been long a practice to
accustom royal personages, even of the gentler sex, to
write a large, bold signature, as that of her present
Majesty Victoria may testify. The letters of mere
children are spoiled in translation, as their interest
consists in the simple peculiarities of expression. In
English, therefore, and to the English reader not very
deeply versed in old French idioms, there is nothing
very remarkable in these letters. One of the shortest
may be thus rendered:-
Loeb sit
MADAM I feel assured that the queen and my
uncle the cardinal make you acquainted with all the
news, and I am thus deterred from writing you at great
length, or farther than to beg you very humbly to hold
me in your good grace. Madam, if it is your pleasure
to increase my establishment with a groom of the
chamber (huissier de chambre), I pray that it may be
Ruflets, my groom of the hall, because he is a very good
and old servant. I send you the letters which madam
my grandmother has written to you. Praying our
Lord to give you with long health a happy life, your
very humble and very obedient daughter, MARIE. }
To the Queen, my Mother.PRO MOT EQUitbro N
The address on the cover is in the same brief terms:
A la Reyne, ma mere.' Royal letters went by special
messengers, who knew well for whom they were
intended without specifying the place. It was a pecu-
liarity, too, especially in the letters of great personages,
that the address should indicate nearly as distinctly the
writer of the letter as the person it was sent to; so in
the same volume there are letters from her uncle,
Henry of Lorraine, with the address-in French of
course To my good Sister, the Queen-Dowager of
Scotland."
The short letter above quoted indicates an amiable
feature in the young queen's character, which adhered
to her to the last, and seemed to grow in her adversity
a kindness and concern for her dependents and
adherents. From the Bishop of Ross to her three
Maries' she identified herself with the interests of
those who were faithful to her a point very inte
restingly brought out by Sir Walter Scott. In the
instances of Chatelar and Rizzio, this feeling became a
weakness, which was the occasion of her worst calami-
ties; but there is no doubt that it laid the foundation
of the chivalrous devotion which procured her so many
champions during her life, and vindicators of her
memory after death.
12
Some of these letters are of considerable length.
They generally bear on matters of family business,
have little sprightliness or youthful carelessness, and
are, on the whole, scarcely like the productions of so
young a person. Nor do they seem to have been
written by dictation or instruction, as they contain
here and there the alterations and erasures which a
letter-writer makes in changing the intention or ex-
pression. But the interest attached to them is
not in their substance so much as in the associations
connected with them, and the wonderful and melan
choly history which passed over the writer between the

JP 1 THE SCALP HUNTERS* ⠀⠀
It is now generally recognised that the pictures of
American savage life given by the novelist Cooper are
far more pleasing than true; and that, in fact, his
Indians and trappers are little more than the phantoms
of a somewhat feeble imagination. Dr Bird came after
with a rough, coarse, masculine touch, which startled
European readers into a conviction that in his Nick
of the Woods' they saw for the first time the denizens
of the transatlantic, forest; and since then more than
one writer has followed in the same trail. Captain
Mayne Reid, although his scene is in a different part of
the continent, is of the Bird school, but with a curious
eccentricity — his genius being distinguished by more
literary refinement, and at the same time more moral
coarseness. It is strange to think that any man should
choose for his heroes a band of professional murderers;
but the taste is quite unaccountable in an author who
possesses an exquisite relish for the beauties both of
nature and sentiment! In the work before us this

full grown and boldly developed a type of health and
savage beauty.
'As she approaches, the men murmur their admira-
tion. There are hearts beating under hunting-shirts
that rarely deign to dream of the charms of women. I
am struck at this moment with the appearance of the
young trapper Garey. His face has fallen the blood
has forsaken his cheeks his lips are white and com-
pressed, and dark rings have formed around his eyes.
They express anger, but there is still another meaning
in them. Is it jealousy? Yes. He has stepped
behind one of his comrades, as if he did not wish to be
seen. One hand is playing involuntarily with the
handle of his knife; the other grasps the barrel of
his gun, as though he would crush it between his
fingers.
The girl comes up. The Indian hands her the
gourd, muttering some words in an unknown tongue-
unknown at least to me. She takes it without making
any reply, and walks off toward the spot where Rube
had stood, which had been pointed out to her by her
companion.
'She reaches the tree, and halts in front of it-facing
round, as the trapper had done.
There was something so dramatic, so theatrical, in
the whole proceeding, that, up to the present time, we
had all stood waiting for the denouement in silence.
Now we knew what it was to be, and the men began to
talk
The conversation referred to the further proceedings
of the Indian; but the general opinion was that he
intended to shoot the gourd from the girl's hand; that
it was no great shot after all; and that, at anyrate, it
would merely equal Garey's.
What was our amazement at seeing the girl fling
off her plumed bonnet-place the gourd upon her head
-fold her arms over her bosom-and stand, fronting
us, as calm and immobile as if she had been carved
upon the tree!'
"There was a murmur in 'the crowd. The Indian
was raising his rifle to take aim, when a man rushed
forward to prevent him. It was Garey!
แ
"No, yer don't! No!" cried he, clutching the levelled
rifle; she's deceived me, that's plain; but I won't see
the gal that once loved me, or said she did, in the trap
that-a-way. No! Bill Garey ain't a-goin' to stand by
and see it."
+
"What is this?" shouted the Indian in a voice of
thunder. "Who dares to interrupt me ?"
66
"I dares!” replied Garey. “She's you'rn now, I
suppose. You may take her whar ye like; and take
this too,' continued he, tearing off the embroidered pipe-
case, and flinging it at the Indian's feet; but ye're
not a-goin' to shoot her down whiles I stand by."
"By what right do you interrupt me? My sister is
not afraid, and"
1
Your sister!”
"Yes-my sister."
"And is yon gal your sister?" eagerly inquired
Garey, his manner and the expression of his counte-
nance all at once changing.
"She is. I have said she is."
"And are you El Sol?"
"I am."
"I ask your pardon; but"-
"I pardon you. Let me proceed!"
"Oh, sir, do not-no! no! She is your sister, and I
know you have the right, but thar's no needcessity. I
have licerd of your shootin'. I give in-you kin beat
me! For God's sake do not risk it as you care for
her, do not !"
"There is no risk. I will show you."
"No, no.
If you must then, let me! I will hold it.
Oh, let me!" stammered the hunter in tones of entreaty.
"Hilloo, Billee! What's the dratted rumpus?" cried
Rube, coming up. "Hang it, let's see the shot. I've
heern o' it afore. Don't be skeert, ye fool! he'll do it
like a breeze-he will!" And as the old trapper said
this, he caught his comrade by the arm, and slung him
round out of the Indian's way.'
This is a fine bit of nature; and our author may take
our word for it that it will excite more admiration than
the most terrible scene in the book. But to proceed
with the adventure.
The girl, during all this, had stood still-seemingly
not knowing the cause of the interruption. Garey's
back was turned to her; and the distance-with two
years of separation-doubtless prevented her from
recognising him.
Before Garey could turn to interpose himself, the
rifle was at the Indian's shoulder, and levelled! His
finger was on the trigger, and his eye glanced through
the sights. It was too late to interfere. Any attempt
at that might bring about the dreaded result. The
hunter, as he turned, saw this; and, halting in his
tracks, stood straining and silent.
'It was a moment of terrible suspense to all of us-
a moment of intense emotions. The silence was pro
found. Every breath seemed suspended, every eye
was fixed on the yellow object--not larger, I have said,
than an orange. O God! will the shot never come?
'It came.
The flash-the crack-the stream of fire
-the wild hurra-the forward rush-were all simul
taneous things. We saw the shivered globe fly off
The girl was still upon her feet-she was safe!

I ran with the rest. The smoke for a moment
blinded me. I heard the shrill notes of the Indian
whistle.. I looked before me. The girl had disup-
peared!

'We ran on to the spot where she had stood. We
heard a rustling in the underwood-a departing footstep.
We knew it was she; but, guided by an instinct of
delicacy, and a knowledge that it would be contrary to
the wish of her brother, no one followed her. We
found the fragments of the calabash strewed over the
ground. We found the leaden mark upon them; the
bullet itself was buried in the bark of the tree, and one
of the hunters commenced digging it out with the point
of his bowie. When we turned to go back we saw
that the Indian had walked away, and now stood
chatting easily and familiarly with Seguin,
re-entered the camp-ground I observed Garey stoop
and pick up a shining object. It was the gage d'amour,
which he carefully readjusted round his neck in its
wonted position. From his look, and the manner in
which he handled it, it was plain that he now regarded
that souvenir with more reverence than ever.'

INDIAN SWEETMEATS.

Indians are far less civilised than we, and work with
far inferior tools than ours, yet some of their manufac-
tures sweetmeats, and their rock among other things-
are very good.
The Hindoos, like ourselves, eat peculiar sweetmeats
and peculiar dishes at certain seasons of the year. We
have our Christmas- bun, cross-bun, twelfth-cake, and
mince-pie; and so they have their various sweetmeats,

with, to you, unpronounceable names, and their rock,
called tilwah, which is only made at a certain festival
namely, the festival of Kali. You will be amused to
read of the rock in all its stages of preparation. Every
confectioner in October has a pole about six feet high at
his door, and to this is nailed a great hook, about a foot
long, and thick in proportion. On one side of this hal-
wahee's (confectioner's) shop-everything in the East is
done in the open air, and every one may gaze and ask
questions, and will be civilly answered-you may behold
a brisk fire, with a huge earthen-pan on it. Before this
pan a man may be seen sitting-for nobody stands when
he can sit with a kind of wooden ladle, and with this he
briskly stirs a quantity of bubbling, black-looking sugar
till it becomes quite tough: he then scrapes it together,
and puts it on a piece of board to cool a little, and then
getting up, and dexterously throwing it on the large hook,
he begins to pull out the tough substance. He draws it
out to the length of four or five feet at a time, and throws
it back, and elongates it again: and so he pulls and
manipulates it till the mass becomes as white as snow.
At this stage of rock-making the halwahee, you may
be sure, is tired enough; and so he wipes his brow, and
sits down, and powders over his mass of sweets with
bruised camphor and cardamums-two sweet-scented sub-
stances. He butters a few bright-looking brass trays,
and rolls out the sugar into these, and strews it over
with a thick coat of a nutty-flavoured seed called till
the Sésame of the Arabian Nights; and it is then cut
into squares, and the rock is made.
"
In the next shop there is displayed another sweetmeat
of the season. Call not what we shall find a Noah's
Ark, for you will see a great many more things there
than the patriarch had under his roof. Here are pre-
sented groups of ladies and gentlemen, some a foot high,
of light, yellow-looking sugar; there are also milkmaids
and water-carriers, with ghurrahs on their heads and pots
on their hips. There are also little barking-dogs, lounging
Brahminy bulls, majestic cocks and pigeons with large
crops, and the stately Ruth (the car of Juggernaut.) One
gets quite bewildered in this heterogeneous mass of sweets.
The figures seem to have been made by pouring the sugar
into moulds, and are, generally speaking, well-propor-
tioned, shewing also a considerable spirit in their action
and expression. Inquire the price of an article, and
everything is wonderfully cheap-one, two, or three pice
is the utmost that is asked; for sugar-cane in that land is
plentiful, and labour little esteemed. I must not forget
to tell you that, as an admixture with these sweet things,
a preparation of wet rice, flattened by a heavy block, and
toasted over a brisk fire of dried leaves, is eaten, which is
called choura. It is crisp, and, when fresh, well-flavoured
enough; but it requires good teeth to masticate it, and
a good stomach to digest it.

' ידיד
Turn we now to another shop. There is something
here which likewise belongs to the festival of Kali, and
is very interesting, although not a sweetmeat. You fix
your eyes on a long wooden bench, rising like an amphi-
theatre, covered over with a snow-white cloth, and upon
this there are arranged all, and perhaps many more articles,
than I have described before as being made in sugar, but
formed here of baked clay, beautifully and appropriately
painted with oil-paint, and varnished, and some besides
powdered with tale. The display is gay in the extreme;
and I have often looked at it with pleasure, and pro-
nounced the potter of the East an ingenious man, who
fashions with his hands the greatest of his idols, and the
smallest lamp which is burned before it, and supplies also
the cheap dish in which the sacrifice is placed before
Mahadeo.
The toys which I have named are as reasonable in
price as the sugar, and three or four rupees would buy
the whole of the contents of the toyman's shop.
What I have now described may be seen at any time of
the day; but the procession of the horrific idol Kali--which
is a fierce, black-looking Amazon, with coarse, flowing
hair, and bloodstained hands commences at four in the
afternoon. She is carried, with beating drums and sound-
ing gongs, and the din of thousands of voices, to the river,
and deposited in the Gunga amidst the plaudits of her
worshippers. Gradually the day declines, and the shades
of evening close over these extraordinary scenes; the
air becomes cool; and the dust settles down. When
it is about dark, preparations are made for an illumi
nation; stakes and bamboos, fanciful trellises, arches,
and festoons of split bamboos, which had been previously
prepared and dotted over with patches of wet clay, are
now covered with little lamps filled with oil, in which
floats a small cotton-wick. As if by magic, the flickering
lights begin all to blaze at once; for there are hundreds
of idle loungers and boys, about the shops, who take a
delight in lighting them. Now is the time for European
little boys and girls to sally forth and see the gay scene,
Displays of toys, paint and tinsel, look best by candle-
light; and so the toys shine, the sugar glitters, and, like
snow in moonshine, the rock looks whitest by the blaze
of these innumerable oil-lamps: even the choura then
appears a tempting thing.
1
O what happy little faces I have seen on this fantastic
day! and how happy I have been myself carrying away
basketfuls of toys and men of sugar!"
The festival of Kali, I may add, which is styled De-
walee, is held on the last four days of the decrease of
the moon in October. The last night on which the
procession takes place is the grandest and noisiest. Fine
weather may almost with certainty be looked for at this
time of the year; and so the crowds of gazers run no
risk of being put to flight, or the illumination of being
extinguished, by the showers of rain that have such a
habit of assisting at an English festivals-ovi on

Mr Cunningham, banker, Dunse, has a Skye terrier of
noted cat-hunting propensity, and which frequently
accompanies its master on shooting excursions. Some
time ago, it treed a cat one morning in the garden, and
after yelping and scratching at the foot for five minutes,
it suddenly turned away and ran into the house! Its
master soon after heard a noise in the kitchen passage
down stairs, and on going down found that the dog had
contrived to disengage a gun from its nail, and was now
eagerly dragging it by the woollen case up the short flight
of steps leading to the front of the house. No doubt was
entertained that the sanguinary little creature, remem-
bering the destructive powers of the gun in the field, was
acting under a belief that the same weapon might secure
the death of the treed cat-reason having carried it thus
far, but having at the same time failed to show how little
use it could have made of the gun after dragging it into
the proposed scene of operations.

of the slug population. Three or four years ago, the
major was one Saturday expecting a couple of bachelor
friends to dinner, and designing to treat them to his best,
he popped a bottle of champagne into the pond that it
might be kept cool till it should be required at table.
Half an hour or so thereafter, hearing a great flutter and
cackle going on in the garden, he went out to see what
was the matter, when behold the two gulls were found
enjoying themselves uproariously over his champagne!
They had contrived to break the bottle about its shoulder
by letting it fall hard on the pebbles, and no sooner was
the breach effected than they had proceeded to regale
themselves with the liquor. They were now thoroughly.

a glimpse of the major, they hopped off with a great

channels as to give us perfect assurance of their authen-

does very surprising things in the way of observing. On
one occasion, when we were from home, Fiddy was found
in a state of extreme agitation opposite our portrait which
hung on the wall, and which, to all appearance, she
recognised and mistook for the original-by the way, as
high a compliment to the artist as that which was paid
to a certain painter by the birds which pecked at the
representation of fruit on his canvas.
THE TWO TEMPLES.
TIME was when Shinar's eastern plair
Was peopled with the tribes of earth,
Sworn in their pride to rear a fane
To grace the scene of Empire's birth,
Where man with man in union strong
Might firmly fix the rule of wrong.
The dread design was vain as vast
Before high Heaven's aroused wrath;'
And o'er the face of earth outcast,
Each nation soon its separate path
Of wealth, or war, or peace pursued,
Subduer oft, and oft subdued.
Thus man's dark passions, self-destroyed,
To crush the good have powerless been
That, still upspringing in the void
Their strife had left, arose unseen,
Till in its calm and hallow'd shade
Her home lost Love again hath made.
Time is when to the western shore!
From farthest cast, and north, and south,
The nations of the world, once more
Together banded, pour them forth,
Their mighty monument to raise
Of Arts' new triumphs now in praise.
Fair first-fruit of Love's genial sway,
And foretaste of a happier hour,
When woes of war have passed away,
And 'neath her noon of peaceful power
Shall Science, bursting Error's chain,
Its rule o'er all the earth regain!
IMPOSSIBILITIES POSSIBLE.
FRITZ.
What mere assertion will make any one believe that
in one second of time, in one beat of the pendulum of a
clock, a ray of light travels over 192,000 miles, and would
therefore perform the tour of the world in about the same
time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in
much less than a swift runner occupies in taking a single
stride? What mortal can be made to believe, without
demonstration, that the sun is almost a million times
larger than the earth? and that, although so remote
from us that a cannon-ball shot directly towards it, and
maintaining its full speed, would be twenty years
reaching it, it yet affects the earth by its attraction in an
inappreciable instant of time? Who would not ask for
demonstration, when told that a guat's wing, in its ordi-
nary flight, beats many hundred times in a second; or
that there exist animated and regularly organised beings,
many thousands of whose bodies, laid close together,
would not extend an inch! But what are these to the
astonishing truths which modern optical inquiries have
disclosed, which teach us that every point of a medium
through which a ray of light passes is affected with a
succession of periodical movements, regularly recurring
at equal intervals, no less than five hundred millions of
millions of times in a single second! That it is by such
inovements communicated to the nerves of our eyes that
we see. Nay, more, that it is the difference in the fre-
quency of their recurrence which affects us with the sense
of the diversity of colour, That, for instance, in acquir.
ing the sensation of redness, our eyes are affected four
hundred and eighty-two millions of millions of times;
of yellowness, five hundred and forty-two millions of
millions of times; and of violet, seven hundred and seven
millions of millions of times per second! Do not such
things sound more like the ravings of madmen than the
sober conclusions of people in their waking senses? They
are, nevertheless, conclusions to which any one may most
certainly arrive, who will only be at the trouble of ex-
amining the chain of reasoning by which they have been
obtained.-Herschel.
ADVERTISEMENT DUTIES.
Ir will be learned through the public channels of in-
formation, that there has been a careful and lengthened
investigation by a committee of the House of Com-
mons respecting the stamp-duty on newspapers. In the
evidence taken on this interesting subject there appears
to have been some curious information furnished by
the manager of the Times.' He mentioned that the
Times' proprietary had paid L.66,000 last year, the
average circulation of the paper per day being 39,000
copies; and that the supplement attached to this large
number was actually too great to pay. He goes on to
say: "The value of the supplement consists of adver
tisements, and those advertisements pay a certain sum, of
course, to the proprietors; that sum is fixed; it is the
same on a small impression as it would be on 100,000.
As the sum which is paid for paper, printing, and so on,
fluctuates, and is increased by the amount of circula-
tion, of course there is a certain point at which the
two sums balance each other. Suppose that the value of
the advertisements in the supplement was L.200, you
would know that you could publish as many papers as
would cost 1.200 to manufacture in paper, stamps, and
printing, and if you go beyond that you publish at a loss;
that is, of course, obvious. The greater the circulation
the greater the loss, beyond a certain limit." It was
asked: Do you not mean that the profit is less?" To
which the mainger replied: "No; the greater the abso-
lute loss from a circulation beyond the point at which the
expenditure and receipts balance each other." Ile repeated,
"an absolute loss;" and he made the point clear, beyond
all possibility of mistake, by taking the instance of the
very day before he gave his evidence-namely, May 27-
when the value of the advertisements in the supplement
precisely balanced the expenditure on the paper, and the
printing of further copies was stopped. The government
charges paid that day by the "Times," in the shape of
direct taxation, for that one publication, amounted to
"I have no doubt in the world
L.395! Again, he says:
that, if there were no considerations beyond a mere
within a couple of years" and at present from ten to
desire to circulate the paper, that it would double itself

the Times' may be said to illustrate our own inability
To compare small things with great the position of
to accept advertisements for our pages. We are occa-
sionally advised to extend the size of our sheet, or issue
a supplement, so as to afford space for advertisements,
which would be so very profitable. The truth being that
the expense for paper and printing of our impression
-from 60,000 to 70,000 copies goes far beyond what
could be realised by any charge for advertisements,
The thing, therefore, is practically impossible. Latterly,
however, to meet a very general call, we have begun to
print an Advertising Sheet, which is done up with our
Monthly Parts. As these Parts use up about 35,000 copies
of the impression, there is a system of advertising so far
in connection with our circulation, although the cost to
advertisers is necessarily high. Should any modification
take place in the fiscal burdens affecting the press, it will
be for us to consider how far any improvements of an
acceptable nature may be made on Chambers's Edinburgh

LOSERS.
SATURDAY, AUGUST 30, 1851.
WHETHER life be a game of skill, as the winners
generally infer, or of chance, as the losers uniformly
assert, it is evidently one in which no man gains always,
whatever industry, forethought, or caution he may bring
to the attempt; while, without these adjuncts, losing
appears to be certain in spite of the fairest opportu-
nities. Those lucky cards of the world are indeed
strangely dealt, with no reference, it would often seem,
to desert or abilities. Every man, it has been said,
gets hold of some of them at one period or other in his
time; and but small research among the waymarks of
common life will suggest that their distribution is by
no means so unequal as one might imagine on first
view. The winners in every case secure the largest
share of attention, and certainly present the most
agreeable subject for remark; but the qualifications
for losing are in some individuals so prominent, and in
society at large so various, that they may well be
noted among the curiosities of character.
The beaten ways to loss of worldly goods and advan-
tages-intemperance, gambling, living above the means,
and so forth-are too direct, and unfortunately too
common, to merit special notice; but some men have
facilities for getting rid of anything like property,
which, compared with these everyday methods, seem
the very effects of genius. The best or the worst of
such people's history (one knows not which to consider
it) is, that their efforts in the losing line are never
accompanied by that degree of selfish gratification
which at once attends and tempts the ordinary spend-
thrift. They are generally hard-workers and spare
livers, taking little enjoyment out of the funds they
dispense, and allowing still less to those in their imme-
diate vicinity. I once knew a man of this order in a
small country town. Mr Slater had a small family,
and inherited what his neighbours regarded as a re-
spectable share. of house and landed property; his
personal expenditure was strictly economical; his
helpmate was a proverb for uncompromising careful-
ness; and their domestic arrangements leaned rather to
the stingy side. Yet Mr Slater's, income diminished
with a celerity which the most determined aspirant to
high life could not surpass. The man had a taste for
improvement, but it was peculiarly his own; and not
only all his time, but all the funds he could command,
were put in requisition to keep carpenters, masons, and
others of the constructive kind in employment on some
portion of his premises. Slater's repairs were always
ruinous. He had a special gift for making things
unsightly, and could turn either house or garden into a
specimen of the waste-and-howling-wilderness variety

on the shortest notice. Besides, his great designs were
never completed-time, money, or patience generally
failing about midway, when the work was abruptly
concluded by the roughest of all patching, which, after
a season's complaint and nuisance, once more gave
employment to the mechanics of the neighbourhood.
By these means, and an immovable attachment to high
rents, Slater contrived to reduce the returns of his
property every year-the natural consequences of bad
tenants. Litigations and disputes with the lord of the
soil also came in due course, till part of his holdings
were leaguered by the law, and the rest utterly unin-
habitable; while his right in the whole was purchased
by a stranger at a miserably low price, which the
necessity of his latter days obliged him to accept. His
neglected and pinchedly-brought-up family sank and
settled, as might be expected, far below the condition
of their birth; and business having retired from Slater,
the old man spent his ill-provided leisure in warning
all who would listen against repairs of any kind,
with literal quotations of the sums he had lost in
improvements.
There is another class of losers from whom property
passes away like the waters from certain lakes, without
any visible outlet-close-handed people who live in
the faith and practice of save-all, and will not part
with a farthing easily. They are generally inheritors,
though often heirless themselves, and by what chance
they escape riches is the natural wonder of their neigh-
bours. Most of them enjoy a reputation for wealth at
some time in their lives; but just when gayer or more
needy relations begin to calculate with certainty on
their testaments, the long-practised economy is found
to be a financial requisition, and tales of usurious but
ill-secured loans, great and bad bargains, or neglected
interests, come out, though they never half explain to
the many disappointed why the childless uncle or.
bachelor cousin is, after all his saying, so little to be
reckoned on. It is curious to remark what an amount
of penny wisdom inveterate losers often possess. Small
expense is generally a terror to them, and they occa-
sionally make shifts to avoid it which might edify real
penury; but Franklin's celebrated maxim, 'Take care
of your pence, and your pounds will take care of them-
selves,' is rendered null and void in their case-the
pence being usually saved at the expense of the
pounds. No risk is too great to run if a comparatively
trifling economy appear on the foreground; and the
miser who triumphantly boiled his gruel in the silver
tea-urn his aunt bequeathed him, rather than purchase
a cheaper and more suitable utensil, though perhaps
a proverbial myth, has many a humble imitator
of his policy. A different but congenial order of

minds are those whose hopes go out so desperately
after gain, that any promise, provided its tone be
high enough, is sufficient to make them peril their
whole stock or provision. Quack schemes for fortune-
making owe their existence to such men, and the
advertisements one meets with in metropolitan papers
proclaiming thousands to be had for the gathering by
one project or other, evince that they are not supposed
to be extremely rare. This belief in spontaneous
profit is not restricted to any limit of fortune or divi-
sion of rank. The scion of nobility and the artisan's
widow are alike to be found among the shareholders of
self-enriching banks and companies expressly consti-
tuted for gold-gathering in Britain; but they are seldom
individuals engaged in active business, and few of the
bold adventurers have ever scraped together with their
own hands the funds they embark so fearlessly. The
professional alchemists who almost monopolised the
quackery of Europe till far on in the eighteenth cen-
tury, appear to have been peculiarly fitted for attracting
and profiting by such trusting souls. An offer to trans-
mute all the pots, tinware, and old iron about his house
into virgin gold-how it must have captivated a worthy
of the kind in times when the state of popular educa-
tion still permitted a belief in the philosopher's stone!
The story of those ages abounds with instances of losing
in that fashion, and the loss was generally wholesale.
'I will buy the lead of all the churches in London and
have it transmuted,' says the dupe in Ben Jonson's
play, out of the fulness of his expectation; and a Polish
nobleman actually carried that design into execution,
by expending on the dull metal his entire fortune, or
rather the remnant left from supplying the scientific
demands of a sage who, after labouring with furnace
and crucible for eighteen months in a certain apartment
of his castle, which no uninvited foot might enter, was
at length missing one day, leaving the count with his
mansion and offices literally full of lead.
Less credulous and far more energetic spirits also
swell the ranks of the losers: men of great business
and bustle, who hurry through work and life as if in
pursuit of Fortune's wheel, and clutch with eager hand
at every chance of gain. They are ready-reckoners of
probable and present profits, and keen-sighted as
regards the nearest advantage; but their vision carries
a short distance. In their hasty generalising, particular
details are overlooked, and their active and busy days
are passed in continuous alternations of hard earning
and rapid loss. These men act as channels for their
own gatherings, and have an extraordinary knack of
multiplying dependents round them; not so much from
liberality of disposition, though they are never niggards,
as from a perpetual inclination to do and rule, which is
apt to turn the stream of their patronage on the worth-
less and the indolent. They make, however, most uncer-
tain holds of trust, and probably leave more reduced
and helpless families than any members of the losing
community. Successful quacks mostly belong to this
order, and so do many of those honest and enterprising
men who devise new branches of industry, or open
unthought-of avenues for trade. Mighty are they in
expedients, and of all but exhaustless energy; yet the
least clever of their generation at times get and keep
the start of them in life, and their superannuated days,
should they ever come to such, are too often poverty-
stricken and comfortless, except through the recollec-
tion of great and working times, concerning which their
memory is apt to be amazingly perspicuous. I remem-
ber an old man in my native village, who lightened the
burden of age, infirmity, and misfortune, by tales of
the time when he kept two shops, a saw-mill, a stage-
coach, and a tavern, in one of the western townships
of the United States. He had emigrated early and
poor, made earnest efforts to better his fortunes, and
succeeded to the extent so faithfully chronicled in his
many narrations.
How the two shops, &c., melted
away and left no trace in his finances was never satis-
factorily explained; but he had returned, increased in
years, though not in goods; and many a day when the
township of his tavern and shop-keeping exploits had
grown to an American city, did he astonish oid neigh-
bours with accounts of the unparalleled profits and
marvellous exertions he had made within its borders.
Some men seem appointed by nature or destiny
money-conductors to certain dispensing hands. They
are active and careful gleaners, even where others have
reaped, in the fields of fortune, economical in all their
thoughts, and unsparingly devoted to business. Yet
with every qualification for realising wealth, they live
in a continual process of losing-the fates having pro-
vided a constant drain on their gatherings in the form
of a grandeur-loving helpmate, an expensive family, or
a race of decidedly ill-doing relatives.
It is sad to look on the profitless toil and unenjoyed
savings of such a life; neither the gala days of the
spendthrift, the magnifications of the great busy man,
nor the miser's reward of mere accumulation, with all
its attendant homage from legacy-hunters, are there,
and the spenders of that poor earner's gains may miss,
but they seldom mourn him. One meets with another
order of very provident losers in almost every society,
for its members are widely scattered. People who
toil, and spare, and lay up through prudent industrious
years, till some speculation which glitters with honour
as well as profit in their eyes charms the well-reckoned
hoard out of strong-box and bank, never to be gathered
back again. These lures to misfortune come in different
shapes to our worldly-wise men, but always spiced
with something of the pride or vanity of life. Some-
times they appear in the building form, sometimes
they tempt to untried branches of trade, and very
often to an extension of business, with all the pomp
and circumstance of commercial increase. Those who
thus venture beyond their depth doubtless merit loss,
and generally meet with it; yet there is a melancholy
lesson in the shipwreck of so much trust and striving.
It is not only the fruits of meagre and laborious days,
the reward of patient toil, or the purchase of lengthy
sacrifice that one regrets to see dwindling away with
the unlucky scheme, but the hope and the glory that
was in it, the thousand day-dreams that were built on
that foundation, and the various efforts of which it was
the goal; for in many an instance the fine house or
great shop has been the plan and promise of years.
The saddest example of losing in this line I ever knew
was a member of the gentle craft; in short, a cobbler.
The aim and high place of his ambition was a shoe-
shop in a back street of the little town in which he had
been born. For that he toiled and hoarded from his
youth, remained unmarried, kept no holidays, and
put in practice such expedients to keep and gather
money that his neighbours set him down for a
miser. It is marvellous what mere determination can
accomplish in the way of saving out of almost any
income. The cobbler persevered in his plan through
many a vicissitude of health and trade, keeping the
outlay far below the earning, till, at the close of almost
twenty years, he found himself in possession of the
sum long resolved upon as a capital sufficient to estab-
lish the shoe-shop. His fancy had chalked out its
arrangements years before, and intimates had grown
familiar, through his confidential details, with the sign-
board, the windows, and the back-parlour, with a glass-
door, wherein he was to entertain his most deserving
customers. They were all completed, to the serious
diminution of his capital-for the cobbler's memory
could spare no jot or tittle of that cherished design-
and the back street talked of nothing else for a fort-
night; yet, whether his selection of goods was injudi-
cious; whether the surrounding tradesmen thought it
incumbent on them to put down the parvenu; or whether
his pride in the great Babylon went beyond his neigh-

bours' toleration, I could never ascertain; but custom
would not come. All the commercial manoeuvres
within his knowledge were tried in vain; low prices
and liberal credit were the only methods by which he
could succeed in creating a sale, and these ruined the
cobbler. He had laid up too much of the trust and
store of life in that scheme to have any chance of
recovering from its disappointment. The man's mind
seemed to fail with his shop, for he utterly mismanaged
its closing affairs; and when the Insolvency Court had
discharged him, and the premises were occupied by
a grocer, who, I am told, daily praised their conve-
nience, and grew actually rich there, he could return
no more to his old working ways, but spent his time
lingering about the door in a state of melancholy stupor,
which deepened into broken health; and he died, they
said, with a low lament for the shoe-shop!
Two fertile sources of loss among the more intelligent
classes are civil lawsuits and impracticable projects
in mechanism. Difficult of explanation as the fact
appears, no losses are more readily referred to at home
with greater equanimity than what are incurred through
these methods. The sufferers in general seem to sur-
vey the havoc made in their finances with a mournful
complacency resembling that of a veteran looking on
his scars.
It may be that the idea of having sought
justice, however vainly, which most losers by law
entertain, gives a salt and a savour to their losses;
while the projectors who would have served science,
and through it the world, but for some cross accident,
besides being sure of eventual success, honour, and
riches, had they only some additional thousands to
spend, gain from theirs a noble opportunity to rail at
the generation which would neither appreciate nor
encourage the great design.
I had two old neighbours long ago in a little country
town, who turned their respective failures to the very
best account by making out of them an interest and an
occupation for their declining days. One of them
had been the chief of a prosperous business which
his father established and bequeathed to him. He
was a steady, quiet, obstinate man, who might have
plodded to his grave in the track on which Providence
had set him, and left the concern much as he found it
to his heirs, had not a pugnacious brother-in-law
quarrelled with him about a small bill, and dragged
him into law. The case of Struthers versus MacLoskie
is doubtless yet familiar to some of those professional
persons who had to do with it during the many years
of its progress through the courts. Which of the
brothers-in-law eventually won, my memory cannot
certify; but I know that the one died a bankrupt, and
the other lived an old man in a small house with his
equally aged partner, pinchedly supported by the
contributions of a married daughter and two nephews.
Nevertheless MacLoskie (for he was the survivor) had
reserved to himself a consolation. Enshrined in an
old desk, which had once done duty in his counting-
house, were sundry bundles bound with red tape, and
consisting of all his lawyer's letters, with every scrap of
the accounts connected with his lawsuit. This hoard
was set up in a secret corner of his habitation; and
thither, in the dearth of all amusement or interest,
would the poverty-stricken man retire to pore over
those endless bills, as the miser does over his more
substantial, though not more useful, treasures. One can
imagine the proud glow with which the old man would
reperuse these proofs of a past importance, reflecting
that it was about him, veritably about himself, humble
as he was, that so much had been written.
My other neighbour had inherited a small but re-
spectable fortune, which might have enabled him to
live in secure comfort, or make a promising start in
business; but the man had a perilous turn for me-
chanics, and after the usual exercises with clocks and
turning-lathes, it prompted him to imagine one of those
self-moving machines-the dream of all mechanical
speculators since the dawn of useful art. It was to
dispense alike with water, air, and steam, and save
labour in every direction from the plough to the piano-
forte. On it the inventor laboured and spent till his
money was gone and his hair had turned gray. It might
be that repeated disappointments stimulated the latter
process, for often had the machine fulfilled his highest
expectations in private, but failed on a public trial. On
one occasion I believe the model actually moved some
twenty feet, and then stood still, to the great chagrin
of several country gentlemen, who had been induced to
patronise the undertaking. That was the last oppor-
tunity granted to his genius, and when I knew the
man he taught a very little school; but the thought,
the time, and the money expended on that engine
formed the Talmud of his life, which he mused, en-
larged, and commented on with the zeal and relish of
the elder rabbins. In the early stages of their acquaint-
ance, MacLeod (for so they called the schoolmaster)
and MacLoskie had many a skirmish touching the
greatness of their respective losses; but peace was at
length established between them, on the tacit under-
standing that each should hear the other's tradition to
an end; and as MacLeod's conclusion was always the
signal for MacLoskie to begin, their meetings were a
terror to the neighbourhood. The old men are long
gone, and I have lived to learn, as most people may,
that life has other gains and losses than those of
worldly or even visible things; yet as failures in such
matters are more obvious, and therefore more easily
discussed, they seem the natural subject of a spare
hour's Essay on Losers, by
ONE WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.
A PEEP INTO THE OBSERVATORY.
PROFESSOR BOND'S CLOCK FOR REGISTERING ASTRONO-
MICAL OBSERVATIONS BY ELECTRICITY.
THE great globe on which we dwell spins round in
space with an even movement from day to day and
either in the direction of its revolution or in the rate
year to year. It has not made any important change,
with which it goes, since the dawn of human history.
Out of this unvarying uniformity the most exact of
all the sciences springs. For man, having learned to
trust to its enduring steadiness, plants his telescope
firmly upon the revolving surface, and looks out through
its tube as it sweeps along in its circular course. Again
and again he sees the same star returning across the
visual area of his instrument. He fixes a delicate
thread in the centre of this, and counts the minutes
and seconds that intervene between the periods when
the star appears to make its recurring contacts with
the thread. If those intervals are always of equal
amount, he calls the star a fixed one; but if they are
of varying length, he notes the difference as the mea-
sure of the wanderings of the star; and the telescope
thenceforth becomes the observatory of an astronomer.
The great object of astronomical observation is the
exact determination of the times when certain im-
portant luminaries pass behind threads placed within
the tubes of fixed telescopes. From multiplied obser-
vations of this nature a knowledge of the planetary and
stellar systems is deduced. But in order that the
deductions may be sound, it is necessary that even
seconds shall be split into fractions. The observer
must be able to say, not only in what second, but also
in what part of a second, the star has been observed
behind his thread. Both his eye and his ear must be
trained by long custom to a state of exalted activity.

The threads within the visual field of his instrument
must also be of the utmost degrees of fineness; for
fifteen spider-threads, held three feet and a half away
from the eye, will cover the breadth which a star seems
to move through in a second. Dr Wollaston has suc-
ceeded in drawing out platinum wire for the use of astro-
nomers to such extreme tenuity, that 150 of them may
be twisted together to make up the thickness of a silk-
worm's fibre; and yet one of these will suffice to cover
the point of a star when placed behind it under favour-
able circumstances. But the better to understand how
it is that such gossamer material can be employed in
the solid work of the observatory, let us enter for a
little while into the interior of one of those interest-fect the process of observing, the astronomer still con-
ing temples of science during the performance of its
ordinary rites.
about
It is night, and the fixed transit telescope is just
to sweep over the star Arcturus. Through
slit, which rises in the opposite wall high into the
roof of the room, we perceive a galaxy of twinkling
stars. As our eyes grow accustomed to the dimness
of the light which alone is allowed to pervade the
space in which we stand, we notice before us a grave-
looking telescope, supported by means of a firm, trans-
verse axis upon two solid piers of stone, and pointing
up towards the higher portion of the slit. An observer
in a loose coat and close cap has already taken his
place in a comfortable reclining-chair, which enables
him, without fatiguing effort, to keep his eye before
the end of the telescope. He holds his tablets and
pencil in his hand, and a large clock-the living genius
of the place--is audibly ticking near. The beats of this
clock the observer is mentally counting. Before he
placed himself in his chair he took the second from the
clock face--that is, he began his enumeration by noting
the number of seconds that had already elapsed in the
current minute. His car is now strained to catch with
precision each succeeding beat, and
observer has estimated and jotted down the fractional
second of one observation a little too soon, the chances
are that the error will lie in the other direction with
the next; and the one inaccuracy will thms tend to
correct and neutralise the other. By this contrivance
the process of observing has been brought to so great
a nicety that even personal errors are taken into
account. The eye of one man sees quicker than that
of another. The peculiar power of the observer's organ
is therefore tested by comparative experiment, und a
refined correction in accordance with this is made in
the record of the observation. ronbolo on es gnol
Notwithstanding all that has been thus done to per-
tinues to find cause for dissatisfaction. It is not
enough that he has made his instruments analyse and
define their own faults of construction it is not
enough that he has fitted them with optical powers that
magnify hairbreadths of space into vast areas; it is not
enough that he has split the errors incident to his own
inexpertness into fragments by causing them to divide
themselves; it is not enough that he has entered into
successful competition with spiders in forming fine
threads for the visual fields of his instruments; it is
not enough that he has made his own rate of perception
to enter as an element into his estimate; for there yet
remains the important fact, that the eye and the ear are
not themselves in perfect accordance with each other.
When the eye notes an occurrence, and marks it as
simultaneous with a sound that is recognised by the
car, the two perceptions are caused by plienoniena that
are perhaps some fraction of a moment asunder from
each other in time. The message that comes through
the car takes longer to pass into the seat of perception
than that which enters by the eye. Every observation
therefore includes a residuary error dependent upon
this source, which is sufficient to distort, to a certain
concentrate its attention upon this eye is strung to extent, the symmetry of the deduced results, making
cycles to seem longer or shorter, and causing suns to
give in an erroneous account of themselves.#
The Americans have taken the initiative in attack-
star as soon as it
impinges upon his sight. The earth moves on with its
almost imperceptible and stately pace, and carries the
telescope and observer with it, until at last the expecteding this source of inaccuracy: they have invented a
object is found within the range of the tube, and the
advancing star appears at the margin of the visual
field.

The circular space in which the star is seen is illumi-
nated by a subdued tinge of artificial light thrown in
from a lantern at the side of the telescope. By means
of this light fine upright threads are discerned crossing
the illuminated field at equal distances. Towards the
first of these the star advances with a twinkling gait,
but with its whitish hue, nevertheless, distinct on
account of being contrasted with the yellower field.
Onwards it moves; the observer following it carefully
with his eye, and counting the clock-beats as they fall.
Thirty-two' was the last reckoning: thirty-three'
follows as the next.. Then for an instant the star
disappears behind the thread-appears again, and beat
thirty-four is heard. The obscuration has taken
place not half-way between the beats, but nearer to
the following than the preceding one in the proportion
of four to six: 336 seconds is therefore jotted down upon
the ready tablets as the period of the occurrence. By the
time the record has been made the star has approached
the second thread. The observer is therefore again on
the alert, and counting the clock-beats that he may
register the transit behind it. This process he repeats
afterwards with the three remaining threads. The five
recorded numbers are then added together; the sum-
total divided by five; and the result, with the hour and
minute taken from the clock-face inserted before it, is
registered as the exact time at which the star passed the
central wire.
The five threads are used, and five observations
taken, simply that any error incident to the process of
observation may be diffused among the five. If the
plan for making electricity register upon paper instan-
taneously both the clock-beats and the exact time
of observation. The observer makes the record of
the latter by merely pressing an ivory key which he
holds in his hand. This gives a more exact result,
because the consent between the eye and the sense of
touch is much more intimate than that between the
eye and car. When the eye is engaged in observing,
the hand can obey almost instinctively a suggestion
coming through it, and indelibly register the instant by
a grasp; for this is a form of obedience that it is prac
tising all life-long. The hand becomes wonderfully
skilled from habit in effecting rapidly the purpose that
has been willed under the influence of the quick sense
of sight; whereas the mental comparison of a sound with
a visible sign involves the necessity of a far slower and
less familiar process, It is this principle that consti-
tutes the value of the American contrivance. Professor
Bond, of Harvard University, United States, is the
inventor of the instrument by which the electrical
register is proposed to be made; and this was exhibited
in operation at one of the sectional meetings of the
British Association, at Ipswich, on the Thursday
morning during the visit of Prince Albert.
In one corner of the council-chamber of the town
hall, in which the meeting was held, stood a small
square frame of mahogany, supporting a cylinder
covered with paper. This cylinder was kept revolving
by means of a weight-and-clock movement, so that it
completed each revolution in a minute. Upon its top
the point of a glass-pen rested, whose interior cavity
was filled with ink, so that, as the cylinder turned
beneath it, a continuous trace appeared upon the paper,
which was lengthened out into a spiral line by a slow

cylinder had made a few turns, in parallel
columns somewhat thus ono od bus :

9 Behind the frame containing the revolving,
cylinder peered forth the face of an astrono-gold
mical clock. From this connecting wires might be
1 seen, passing backwards into a cupboard containing a
charged galvanic battery, and forwards to the regis-
tering cylinder. The steady, click, click of the clock
was telling off the seconds in the usual way; and so
long as no electrical communication was established
between it and the registering apparatus, the cylinder
continued to move on with stolid indifference, covering
itself with parallel columns of even lines; but as soon
as the clock and the cylinder were brought into electri-
cal relation by an altered arrangement of the wires,
the aspect of affairs was strangely changed. The pen,
before so quiet and sedate, became all at once convulsed
with a paroxysm of twitches, which of course registered
themselves upon the paper of the cylinder; so that the
parallel columns produced by a few successive turns
of the apparatus now presented this

Each little offset, in each column had been
made simultaneously with a beat of the clock,
and was in fact, the permanent record of a correspond-
ing second. The eye and ear could easily trace the
connection while the operation was in progress. Each
twitch of the pen was evidently instantaneous with a
sonorous beat of the pendulum some mysterious sym-
pathy connected together the movement and the sound.
The secret, of the sympathetic connection was simply
this: the pen was fixed to an armature of steel, placed
close to the extremities of a horse-shoe of soft iron. This
horse-shoe was surrounded by a coil of the connecting
wires, Whenever a current of galvanic electricity was
passed along the coil, the horse-shoe iron became a mag-
time to record the passage of the star behind one, and
prepare himself for its contact with the second, before
that occurrence could take place. But in observing by
the aid of Professor Bond's apparatus, the wires may be
so close that the successive star-contacts may be made
almost in consecutive seconds, for the band will be ready
to register them as quickly as they can happen. In this
way a considerable saving of time will be effected in
making each observation- an important piece of
economy when many are to be taken in the course of
a day bge of methad
1
It has been proposed that this instrument shall be
made a means of ascertaining the rate with which the
electric current travels. Suppose, for instance, the
case of a break-circuit clock working at London, and
registering its time simultaneously upon two cylinders
at once the one placed, close by in London, and the
other at the end of a long connecting wire in Liver-
pool; and let it be assumed that the electric influence
that ran along the wire to register the seconds in
Liverpool took a quarter of a second to travel to its
journey's end; then, although each clock - beat was
registered a quarter of a second later in Liverpool
than in London, there would be no possible means of
ascertaining the fact. But now, again, imagine that in
this state of affairs an observation is made in Liver-
pool of the passage of a star behind the transit-thread
of a telescope, and that the observation is registered
simultaneously upon both the Liverpool and London
cylinders by an offset effected through the instrumen-
tality of a break-circuit wire held in the observer's
hand, then the record in London would be made a
quarter of a second later than the record in Liverpool,
owing to the time taken by the transmission of the
recording influence. And when the records upon the
two cylinders were placed side by side, and compared
together, this, would become immediately apparent : in
fact, there would be found a
would have been
with itself. Whenever the galvanic current was inter- doubled, for second registered in Liverpool a
rupted, the magnet lost its power, and allowed the arma-quarter of a second later than the second was in Lon
ture and pen to spring away for a short distance under
the influence of an elastic force. Each springing away
of the pen registered itself by an offset upon the paper.
Whenever the pen was held in close contact with the
magnet, the even line was traced. The clock itself
was placed in the line of connecting wires, so that each
time the pendulum swayed from side to side it broke
the contact of the conducting line, and thus arrested
the passage of the electric current for an instant: and
thus each effect formed by the pen, when the horse-
shoe ceased to be a magnet, came to be simultaneous
the beat of the clock which arrested the galvanic
current that sustained the magnetic power.
When an observation is to be recorded by the aid of
this instrument, the observer takes a small key of
ivory, attack and registering-cylinder in communi-
the
end of a wire in his hand. He

don; and the observation made in Liverpool was re-
gistered another quarter of a second later in London
than in Liverpool. It was therefore registered later,
and, so to speak, by earlier time, so that both the
lateness of the register and the earliness of the time
became elements in the result. It will be under-
stood that the rate assumed for the velocity of the
electric influence is greatly exaggerated for the sake
of familiar explanation. It is well known that it
would not need anything like a quarter of a second
for its transmission from London to Liverpool. But
it is anticipated that its velocity is by no means
so great but that it may be detected by the break-
circuit apparatus when the longest possible circuit
of wires has been selected for the performance of the
experiment.
The astronomer-royal is contriving a modification
of the break-circuit apparatus for the use of the
National Observatory. He proposes, for economical

is already prepared, is twenty inches long and twelve
in diameter, and is to be made to revolve once every
two minutes, affording space upon its surface for a six
hours' record. For the present, the rotation of this
cylinder is to be effected by a separate train of wheel-
work, and is to be kept uniform by means of a mer-
curial pendulum revolving in a circle of 20 degrees
diameter instead of oscillating backwards and for-
wards. The driving power is to be transmitted to this
necessarily placed so far asunder that the observer had radial aim by a modification of the steam-engine

will have had ample opportunities within the last few
years of moralising sadly over the mutability of
all things earthly-antipodean or otherwise-in the
shape of banks bankrupt, and property that profiteth
not. Diverse have been the discussions as to the
cause of these reverses among the hardy colonists,
by many of whom, especially the squatter portion,
the whole was ascribed, and perhaps not unjustly, to
the sudden withdrawal of convict labour, thereby
depriving them of what they had no means of replacing,
and throwing them unexpectedly on their own re-
sources. That convict aid was the chief element in
the rapid prosperity of the settlement cannot be
denied; yet, as bringing in its train numerous evils, not
quite so evident at first as the advantages, it was not
surprising that long before penal labour was aban-
doned there were many persons who felt that the time
had come to put the colony fairly on a trial of its
merits for a due supply of working matériel, and who still
feel, that if its capabilities are equal to the represen-
tations made of them, there will always be a sufficient
inducement for persons to emigrate from the mother
country, and thus supply the want complained of.
Perhaps had there been greater circumspection in
the arrangement of the ill-fated outlaws to their
masters, the system would have existed to the present.
In my time almost any person who could prove that
he was in possession of a few acres of land could
have one or more convicts assigned. Often these small
proprietors were themselves recently liberated felons,
not more reputable or trustworthy than some of the
persons committed to their care; generally in such
cases master and assigned servant lived together in the
same gunych or little hut-a communion not unfre-
quently terminating in horrible details of murder,
perpetrated on or by the ignorant and criminal masters.
Nor was it uncommon, as inquiry proved, that persons
of great respectability abused their trust; neglecting
the moral welfare of those assigned to them, punishing
them with undue severity, and providing them with
scanty and unwholesome food; while others again, with
ill-judged leniency, allowed their convict servants such
licence that they became unmanageable, and fell from
one step to another, until some glaring atrocity brought
them back to gang-labour.
sionally by the 'baling-up' gentry. Arms or numbers
served not to protect from these cunning and adventu-
rous vagabonds, who, unexpectedly making their ap-
pearance with ready-cocked double-barrelled guns, or
other unpleasant-looking weapons, left their victims
no choice but to surrender unconditionally. Even to
this hour the sound of 'bale up,' when so saluted by
an Australian friend, brings with it anything but
agreeable feelings, and I always expect to hear the
accompanying click of a gun-lock.
Of the many brigands who traversed the country in
1832 and 1833, raising 'black-mail,' none were more
daring or notorious than the Bold Donoghue and his
band. Songs were written extolling the prowess of
himself and his lads; and the morning-chant of the
convict servant, as he hied to labour, was often in
praise of this gang of villains. The daring, the known
sanguinary character of the leader, together with his
almost ubiquitous powers, by which he seemed to put
time and distance out of the question, caused his name
to become a general source of apprehension. Scarcely
a week passed over in which some impudent robbery
was not recorded against him, and the mounted police
sent out on his trail; but while perhaps they were
hunting for him at Maitland or Scone, they would
receive intelligence of a later crime on Liverpool Plains,
or some other more distant locality. Two other run-
aways, Webber and Walmsley, were usually his accom-
plices-Underwood, his first associate, having been
put out of the way, as will hereafter appear. I was
then residing near the Hunter River, and although
in the most likely place to receive a visit from
Donoghue, had so long escaped that much of the zest
of pleasing expectation' had subsided, and my family
of young cornstalks ceased almost to think of the bold
highwayman,

colony. Once entered on the path of crime, nothing
seemed too atrocious for the bushrangers: they lived
in a state of continual excitement, endeavouring by
inebriating stimulants to banish from their minds the
forebodings of evil; wandering from place to place
like evil spirits, and afraid of the gaze of their fellow-
men, except when the way to plunder was safe and
expeditious.
In those days persons who lived in the remote sta-
tions, or who had frequent occasion to visit Sydney,
settlers had not business ruled it otherwise. Innkeep-
ing, or rather pothouse-keeping, has always been one of
the most lucrative though most disreputable ways of
money-making in New South Wales. Such places are
too often there, as in the mother country, the haunts
of all the bad and dissipated characters; with this
addition, that translation from the mother country,
whether as bond or free, has generally altered for the
worse the habits of the lower orders; and it would
perhaps be impossible to meet with similar scenes of
rioting, drunkenness, and swearing in any other colony
as are met with in these rural taverns. Moreover here,

as in all newly-risen colonies, there was a freedom of
thought and action common to high and low; and in
the country-houses of entertainment, the man who had
a little money, and sober enough not to break glass,'
might take his place in the best room with the richest
settler, thereby bringing the traveller sometimes into
very strange company.
་
On the present occasion I was not more fortunate
than usual. The general reception - room contained
a party of eight or ten who were enjoying the
'stone-fences' (brandy and ginger - beer), while the
smoke emitted from about the same number of pipes
almost obscured the struggling rays of the candle
intended for our illumination. Some of the neigh-
bouring squatters present, with whom I had slight
acquaintance, soon entered into conversation; and we
were afterwards joined by a stranger, who, leaving his
own companions, seemed very desirous of introducing
himself to our notice, but in such an awkward, half-
confident, half-sheepish way, that I felt almost at a
glance that he was what is usually styled a 'lag,' or
convict on leave. His dress was that of a poor squatter
a cloth shooting-jacket, the worse for wear, and a pair
of moleskin nethers, kept up by a leathern belt. The
face, as far as could be seen under the broad grass-hat,
was pleasing, and indicative of mildness, which his voice
also confirmed; but his restless, uncertain manner made
me regard him with extreme suspicion. Neither the
place nor company was such as to induce me to remain
long; and accordingly I retired to my modest sleeping
apartment, where I had been for some time trying to
accommodate myself to the attacks of the fleas and
B flats, those very numerous enemies of mankind in
the antipodes, when to my astonishment Master Buka
entered very unceremoniously, his manner indicating
that he had something of importance to communicate.
It may be well to mention that Buka had been taken
at an early age from his tribe on Lake Macquarrie, and
brought up with much care to eradicate the propensi-
ties of the savage; but although personally attached
and strictly faithful to my interests, he retained much
of the irreclaimable wildness of character which per-
tains to the race. It was no uncommon thing with him
to betake himself to the bush for a season, joining his
own or any other tribe which would admit him, whence
he would again return to my service. He was, therefore,
in the habit of addressing me in his own language, or
the patois introduced among them by the settlers.
Giving a cautious look round, he whispered in my ear:
Bale me like that wanagail fellow, piyaller with you
to-night-that fellow Webber.' In short, he informed
me, very much to my disquiet, that he had recognised
Donoghue and Walmsley in the darker corner of the
parlour, and that the timid gentleman was no other than
their companion Webber, who had probably been sent
over, on hearing my name, to ascertain my route, on
the morrow, and which in the conversation had been
inadvertently made known to one of the squatters.
.
My first impulse, on learning that this notorious
gang was so near, was to call the landlord and ask
assistance to secure them; but Buka told me they were
off soon after I retired; that, being well mounted, they
were far beyond the possibility of capture; that no-
thing but devil devil could catch them;' and that if we
made the attempt, or raised any alarm, their friends
in the village would assuredly inform them, thereby
entailing the certainty of an early visit at our station.
Having passed a restless night, what between the real
attacks of fleas and the imaginary ones of robbers, we
got on our road at an early hour, taking care not to
apprise mine host of our knowledge of the parties who
had been entertained in his house the previous night.
He might perhaps have not been aware who they were;
but at that time most of the country tavern-keepers
considered only that these bushrangers were lavish of
their easily-acquired gold, and that giving unsuccessful
information was the surest way to bring them to the
establishment, not to spend money, but to extort it.
Who that has visited Australia can readily forget the
delightful freshness of the morning air, breathing its
acacia odours, and reminding him of the blooming
heath on mountain or moor in his distant native land?
Its mildly-bracing effects put rider and horse in good
spirits, and in about two hours we reached the quiet,
sequestered hut of an old miser, well known by the
sobriquet of Dirty Jemmy, whose gunyeh was the usual
halting-place of those travelling northward, and where
most persons stopped to bait their cattle. On reaching
the hut, Buka hailed the inmate; but instead of receiv-
ing the usual reply, was accosted with 'Who the devil
are you? Stand off-I'll bale up no more for mortal
man!' at the same time the tip of a rusty musket was
protruded through one of the loopholes with which the
tiny edifice was perforated-an attempt at fortification
which testified to the insecure nature of the district.
With some difficulty old Jemmy was made to under-
stand that ours was a friendly visit, on which he
allowed us to enter, while he took charge of the horses.
The cause of his exasperation was soon learned. In
the middle of the previous night the Bold Donoghue
and friends had been on a visit to Jemmy; and although
they took no money-possibly on account of the old
man having been once a convict-yet, as he said with a
sigh, they made me cook the best parts of some
sheep intended for the day's market at Paramatta, and
fed their horses without payment,' which, to old Miser
Jemmy, were mortal offences. His account of Donoghue
certainly did not afford me any increased feeling of
security for the money in my pocket. Oh, he's a
devilish - looking ruffian, and so's Walmsley; but
Webber's a quiet chap.' Before settling with Dirty
Jemmy, I asked him how he would have acted had
money been demanded. He replied: "Why, all the little
I have I'll keep; I've been "baled up" three times-
I never gave money. O no; blood they might take,
but old poaching Northamptonshire Jemmy never
would give up the dust.' He advised me, in conclusion,
to take the path to the Maitland side, and not the main
road, as he had heard them mention that as being the
probable route of some one they expected shortly. From
this retired spot all our ride was now through a
magnificent forest country, traversed by lines of hills,
along the summits of which our path lay, every now
and then looking down into immense valleys, in which
scarcely anything was visible but rows of towering red
gum, blue gum, and swamp oak, while here and there,
matted on the rocks, were numerous dendrobias, with
their clusters of yellow-white or mottled flowers. With
some reluctance Mr Buka informed me under what
circumstances he had first become acquainted with
Donoghue; and as the general truthfulness of his
leading statements was afterwards confirmed by the
confession of the bushranger, I may as well put it in
a connected form before the reader.
'You remember, bingai (friend), the feud that existed
between my tribe and the Wyongali about the capture
of a jin or native wife, and I had promised the husband
and brother to go with them to avenge the wrong.
Well, last year we spent many days on the Wollomtai
range, for we had been told that some of the Wyongali
were abroad in the neighbourhood, and with cautious
step we prowled about on our mission. Evening had
closed in upon us. Fearing to light a fire, we lay
down beside a fallen tree, as is our custom, covering
ourselves with the soft, yielding bark of the tulka or
tea-tree-for you know that the gatti (dead men) and
povrang (the evil spirits) are then flying about, and we
dared not move after dusk. In about an hour my
companions, Pir-ra-ma (the Wild-duck) and Mot-to
(the Black Snake), called my attention to the glimmer
of a fire at some distance. "Now," exclaimed the
bereaved husband, "the piyaller blood for my jin!”

Much to our surprise we saw two white men in a

Trusting to my lynx-eyed guide, I was not long in
reaching the path leading down to the southern bank of
the river Hawkesbury, whose tortuous windings lay
mirrored below us in a series of broad bright sheets, on...

they not had something specific in view, they would
probably have turned up by the Windsor Road, where
they might expect better game; and, moreover, the

they might look for determined opposition.

The enemy was getting on apace, and we were yet
seven miles from Wiseman's Ferry, our destination, and
under the circumstances I was rather puzzled what to
do. To go forward would be to meet the party; our

broadly and brightly down between its mountainous
limits, resembling more a chain of lakes than a river.

nature's own painting I had ever looked on.

scenery by the conversation of some convicts who
were wending up the hill before us. Yes, he'll be

overrun with waterlilies, excepting at a narrow
stripe, in which our horses picked their way with

My chief reason for taking this route
homewards was to inspect a property I had recently pur-
chased near Mangrove Creek, and I hoped to reach it
at an early hour in the afternoon. In this, however, I
miscalculated. We had arrived within seven or eight
miles of it, when, happening unfortunately to halt for
a short time at the hut of shingle-splitters to inquire
the nearest way, Master Buka, whose olfactories were
of the most critical acuteness, detected the remains of
roasted kangaroo. Under pretence of lighting his pipe,
he dismounted, and was not long in getting what he
termed a belly-tightener. Of this I was not aware
until, calling upon him to mount, he returned a sort of
low growl not unlike that of a wild beast disturbed in

ful effects of choking and thirst. At length we reached
a tolerably clear space, and got past the fire, which I
now observed with satisfaction was rapidly spreading
towards where we had distanced our pursuers, whom
I was uncharitable enough to wish it might overtake.
My poor horse, with the attachment and instinct of
some of his race, had followed closely behind us, and
thus enabled me to ride into Mangrove; and on the fol-
lowing morning Buka set out to recover the one he had
been riding the previous night, but the poor creature
was found dead in the bog, and with difficulty even the
saddle was recovered. Another yanaman was procured

About a week afterwards I received a hurried note
from a neighbouring magistrate requesting me to give
all the information I could relative to the dress and
appearance of these wretches, as a foul murder had
just been committed by them on a Mr Clements. It
appeared in evidence that this amiable person had set
out from Sydney, taking with him a considerable sum
of money; he was going to Captain Bingle's station,
and had with him two armed attendants-Hickey, a
discharged soldier, and another styled Billy the Welsh-
man. The party was crossing the Bulga Road towards
the Hunter, little anticipating an attack, as they were
so well prepared to defend themselves. Three persons
were observed coming towards them with guns in their
hands; but being dressed like squatters, and having
kangaroo dogs, Mr Clements supposed they were
merely sportsmen. Donoghue walked up at the head
of his party, and after the usual salutations of the
country, asked Mr Clements to give him some tobacco.
This he was preparing to do, when the bushranger said
to him in a rough, quick way: 'Come, come, mister,
what are you humbugging about it so long?' Mr
Clements, perceiving at once into what company he
had fallen, endeavoured to draw out one of his pistols ;
unfortunately they were fastened through the trigger-
cover to his belt-a matter which had not escaped
Donoghue's attention. In this dilemma Mr Clements
called on his servants to fire; but the words were
scarcely out of his mouth before Donoghue killed him
by discharging both barrels of his gun. At the same
time, the other bushmen presented their arms against
the attendants, who quickly surrendered. Both of
them acted with so much want of decent courage that
it led to the supposition that they were accessories;
but perhaps their pusillanimity was excusable if we
remember the characters of the men they had to deal
with, and if, as has happened, a whole coachful of
armed persons could be baled up' by three or four
bushrangers, two not very stout hearts might be par-
doned for yielding without a shot.
After this outrage became known, a strong force was
sent out in various directions, and a reward of L.100
was offered for the apprehension of Donoghue. For
several weeks the mounted police were in pursuit, but
his intimate knowledge of the country enabled him to
elude their endeavours for some time. At length,
separated from his companions in crime, and wandering
up and down the country-the most miserable of Cains
-he became less particular about his haunts. Infor-
mation was given of his being in the neighbourhood of
the Bargo-Brush, between Campbeltown and Berrima,
on the southern road. A patrol of mounted police.
came unexpectedly on him, but not before he had first
fired and slightly wounded one of them, who, taking a
good aim at Donoghue, killed him on the spot.
Walmsley and Webber escaped for some little time,
but were ultimately hunted down, and suffered that
penalty which I had secretly wished for them in passing
the gibergunych. After that the neighbourhood was
tolerably free from bushrangers; but to this day, in
the district of Hunter River, the name of the Bold
Donoghue is connected in the squatter's mind with
murder and terrorism.

POETRY OF THE DAY.
HARDLY a magazine is now published,' observed
Moore to Scott, when talking of the poetry of the
day, but would once have made a reputation.'~~
Ecod!' said Sir Walter, we were very lucky to
have come before these fellows!' If one were not
disarmed by the good-humour of the remark, it
might be hinted that both the interlocutors have now
subsided into the rank of the minor poets of their own
generation, and that therefore the compliment paid to
the lesser lights of our day was not very extravagant.
There may be plenty of Scotts and Moores among us,
but assuredly we do not boast of many Wordsworths
and Byrons, or Shelleys and Keats! But nevertheless
there is in these last days an astonishing under-current
of poetry welling constantly on, and working its way
towards the light. The struggle after excellence, how-
ever, though brave, is fitful. The difficulty of concen
trating the thoughts becomes greater and greater; for
although the whole world of mind is astir, its attention
is snatched hither and thither by the events and exigen-
cies of a time in which all men are busy from morning
till night in hearing or telling some new thing in art,
science, or history. If this is not the cause of an inter-
regnum in poetry which threatens to rival in duration
the peace, we know not what is; for the age is essen-
tially poetical, and even in its everyday life are seen
the embodied forms of what in earlier times were only
dreams and prophecies.
We have caught up at random two of the poets of
the day, and shall set them to do their spiriting for the
delectation of our readers; in some hope of being able
to force from them the secret, why they are not great
poets, but merely the producers of such works as
would once have made a reputation.' It is possible
that the titles of these volumes may call up only a
faint recollection-if any at all-in the mind of some
readers, but that is of no consequence. It is a pecu-
liarity of the time that even genius of a high order is
frequently stumbled upon in unknown books-for
unless the genius has concentration and sustained
power, it takes no decisive hold of the palled and jaded
mind of the age-and if this should be so in the present
case, we are all the more thankful to have the oppor-
tunity of drawing attention to real merit.
The first of these books is Lelio,'* in the prin-
cipal piece of which we see as clearly as is possible
(though that is not very clearly) into the character of
the poet's mind. His idea seems to be to give a kind
of personification of Conscience, or rather of the opera-
tions of conscience, such as would have the same effect
upon an intending criminal as the animated eyeball, as
it were, of the Phidian Jupiter, fixed on him, and flash-
ing with divine indignation.' He would give a local
habitation and a name to our avenging thoughts, and
which must be in some sort suited to the nature of the
crime.' His pictures are no mere creations of sentiment,
but the embodiments of an evil conscience, put forward
in poetical garb and prominence,' and which he supposes
'to be forced upon the reflective part of man's nature
while he is carrying on his schemes of worldly pleasure
and aggrandisement.'
This great and difficult attempt commences with a
light conversation on love and wine-two kinds of
enjoyment which are poetically entwined by one of
the speakers; but in the next scene the poem really
begins. Lelio is wandering among the Apennines
immersed in twilight musings on the ways of God to

man,' in the course of which he earnestly longs to
behold in real form and presence that mystical power
--if we comprehend the author-which operates by
means of the conscience:
'Or see before me pass in specular vision
The distant truths that form the essential sound
Of which the world's hard life is but an echo.'
His meditations appear to have a creative power :-
-Ha! the time fits these thoughts, and these wild
thoughts
I see it
Have given formation to the dusky air;
Or, do I dream, or is the gloom around
Heap'd into shape, such fitful shape as suits
Impalpable things? Again 'tis there!
Deepest amid the deepening shades, and growing
In fearful life; its features only seem
Distinctly fashion'd, yet shew less the impress
Of physical nature than the hot reflection
Of a sun-like soul; as if creative power,
Willing to give to mind a visible clothing,
Materialized a God's intelligence !'
C
This phantom is an Angel, his bodied thought,' by
whose ministration he is forthwith conveyed to the
world of spirits.
6 Angel, What seest thou, Lelio ?
Lelio. Nothing!
A. Look again; thine eyes
Are not yet cleansed from earth. What seest thou?
L. Nothing
Distinctly, but as 'twere the flickerings
Of undulating gloom.
A. Once more, what seest thou?
L. That which might shake a statue! All around
Dim shapes are looming into light, as flashes
Of a pale flame, instinct with morbid life,
Reveal the infernal palace of the dead.
Some lie as if the sickness of despair
Had fed upon their strength, and stolen its colour
From the unhoping eye; on glittering thrones,
Raised haply by magnificence of crime,
Are seated kingly and yet drooping forms,
The burning aristocracy of hell!'
All this is explained by a personage called Eidolon; a
word which means image generally, and which the poet
applies to signify ambition-pleasure-avarice; any of
those treacherous cupbearers of the heart which drug
the bowl with poison. Eidolon is all in turn, and exhi-
bits the extremes of enjoyment and remorse, giving
matter for didactic conversation between the seer and
the angel. Unsatisfied, however, with this view of the
unveiled passions, Lelio desires to see beyond them-to
see power itself in the work of creation. This, too, is
accorded.

Angel. Away then-in thy breast
I breathe the spirit that will bear thee up
Unfaintingly above the realms of matter.
Away, on rushing wings that leave behind
The sunbeam in its flight, and to the regions
Unvisited by Heaven's extremest star!
What seest thou, Lelio?
Lelio. Let me look again,
For my sense swims upon a boundless ocean,
Struggling against its own magnificence.
I see the flashings of bright points that pierce
The solid night, whence floats a spinning sound
Of a low melody-while round me ripples
Impalpable ether, whose conflicting waves
Breaking in flame, the evanescent bloom
Of blackest darkness, shew nought near but thee
Standing beside me in untenanted space!
Behold, immeasurable shadow creeping
O'er the clear void, and from a form that might be
The form of man, could the weak eye take in
Its limitless outline, stretches forth a hand,
Within whose hollow rests a new-born world;
The other arm extends a mantle o'er
Its naked limbs, and showers all forms of matter
And fire of mind upon its mighty surface,
Heaving the pulse of a stupendous life!
A little while those awful fingers poise
The trembling globe, then hurl it flashing from them;
Away, it rushes through the lash'd air, waking
Time into life, and night to light-away-
Lifting its voice of giant joy, and shouting
To the unbounded universe, to welcome
A radiant brother of God's ancient stars!"
The next vision is the typical history of the new-
born planet-which may be supposed to be our own-
and which, passing through the reign of war and vice,
arrives at length in the course of ages at the perfection
of virtue and happiness-and then vanishes in space.
On this consummation the Angel declares-
Thus will it be, but on the highest point
Man is not placed at once, nor nature bids
The gradual seed spring instant to a tree.
Up the slow path he toils enduringly-
Such is Heaven's law
climbing.
and gathers strength by
And think not that the buried past hath hid
Its treasures with it-that the single soul
Work'd singly, and then died- it cannot die
In its large life! The spirits of all time
Are but the swelling waves of one vast ocean.
The meanest mind that thinks, but forms a part
Of an eternal whole, the faintest flash
Flows in to aggregate the living sun
Of glory, less than God's!'
It will be seen from these quotations that there is
much lofty and genuine poetry in the volume; but the
clue to the philosophy is lost ever and anon, till, before
the close of the piece, it is entirely forgotten. We
receive the idea that Mr Scott while writing had either
no distinct conception at all of his own subject, or that,
owing to the want of a power of concentration, it
vanished every now and then from his mind. The
mixing up with so fine and lofty a strain a common-
place story of human passion is of itself a symptom
of weakness; but independently of this, our author
superior- of confounding lovesomeness with beauty.
makes the vulgar mistake-to which he ought to be

it as our opinion that if Mr Scott had been able to

must strike every reader of judgment as an incon-

which we look upon as one of the most remarkable
of the time, both in power and promise.
Lelio. Oh! let me not
Faint ere I fill my gaze! Before me springs
Expanding visibly the fresh growth of beauty,
An exhalation of divinity
Clings to her like an atmosphere, each limb
Seems moulded by the Deity anew,
While the blue veins swell proudly, as if crying
It were a damning shame on him who tried
To soil that glorious temple! 'Tis a shrine
Where saints might worship!
Angel. She was form'd from dust.
Lelic. Dust! ay, a most brilliant dust, of which
Each atom was a star! I may speak madly,
But to be madden'd by a cause like this
O'erweighs a world of reason. I dare tell thee,
All angel as thou art, thou hast not seen

attempted a long flight, but has continued for many
years showering around him, with a prodigal hand, all
sorts of lyrics that address themselves to the sentiments
and affections. There is no naine better known than
his în periodical literature; and not a few of his pieces
will bear comparison with the best of the kind that
have been produced in his own generation." But his
range is limited. He is satisfied with the external
world which presents itself to his senses, and busies
himself with the humanities of life. His muse flies

THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON
poll mAugust 1851.
By the time these lines appear in print the majority
of your renders will have seen the Exhibition, and
returned to their homes with a reminiscence of which
they will become prouder the longer they live; and not
a few will now be able to comprehend the force of the
Spanish saying See Seville, and die." What a subject
wherewith to delight and instruct the minds of future
grandchildren! As day after day passes over, pouring
its sixty or seventy thousand visitors into the Palace
of Glass, so do the perceptions and experiences of the
executive officers becoine clearer and wider. Differ-
ences in taste, skill, and handicraft, before unobserved,
become appreciable in the articles exhibited; compari-
sons can be more fairly instituted; and, as a conze-
quence, we must hope that the judicial awards"
will be
the more conscientiously pronounced. There will of
course be complaints, but if justice be done even the
dissatisfied may be conciliated.
Such is the sum of one division of our metropolitan
talk; another topic, and a notable one, is whether the
building shall, in accordance with the terms of the
contract, be pulled down after the close of the Exhi
bition. As yet the 'noes' have it until next May; but
unless parliament, or some other equally efficacious
power, make the temporary preservation permanent,

we shall lose the means and opportunity of establish-

scarcely less attractive than the Exhibition itself, and a
desideratum much hoped for by all who love to see
nature yielding to art for man's beloof, and more espe-
cially by those of delicate lungs condemned to wear
respirators. After the hitimation which has been given,

be the nation's fault if the Building falls. Lieutenant-
Colonel Lloyd proposes to purchase the raw materials,
models, &c. now exhibited, to create a vast and most
useful collection of the products and works illustrating
the arts and manufactures of the world, which might

Signs of what, is called progress' are apparent in
the formation of a committee with a view to establish
a uniform rate of postage throughout the world, com-
prising natives as well as foreigners; the latter to
undertake the task of bringing the subject before their
respective governments, and of inducing them, if pos-
sible, to assent to the proposed arrangement. The
proposal to make penny receipt stamps universal is
still talked about, with more or less of favour, as well
as the newly-announced Plan for Registration-Offices
for Needlewomen;"the intention of which," according
to the prospectus, is to improve their (the needle-
women's) condition, and prevent their pauperism
by securing to them the profits of their own work.
The plan promises the consumer a superior article
for his money and to enable men, without any
ments, as easily, and with as much economy, as expe-
rienced females can do. It also proposes to afford every
facility to families in finding suitable needlewomen,
either to work by the day or by the piece, and securing
them against loss by damaged work or non-fitting
garments. The promoters of this measure who, by
the way, might advantageously bestow a little pains

is not less an evidence of locomotive facilities than of
the attractions of the Exhibition. 3 1 3-0 99977
Of other matters, I may tell you that the poet-eclipse along the line of its totality, from some of the
laureate has betaken himself for awhile to Italy; that
Mrs Browning has come over to see the Exhibition, and
that her noble poem Casa Guidi Windows' has been
translated into Italian by Mazzini for the edification of
his countrymen, Lamartine is busy with a History
of the Restoration of Monarchy in France, intended as
a sequel to his Girondists; Mr Gladstone's History of
the Roman State,' translated from the Italian, is an
acceptable addition to our knowledge of that apparently
exhaustless subject; then we have a 'History of Adult
Education,' by the secretary of
næum, and De la Rive of the Manchester Athe-
is to give us
"Treatise on Electricity,' with such historical details
and elucidations as will add largely to its value; and
Liebig is increasing knowledge and his own reputation
by a new edition of bis Familiar Letters.' Thus you
will see that all business is not at a standstill. Besides
these, there is a work published at Lyons on the Meta
physics of Art,' in which the author takes a logical view,
and says: The best endeavour in the interest of art
is not to study it in itself and abstractedly, but to
appreciate it in a single point of view, in its general
relation to nature, and the actions and destiny of man.'
And next, a poem in six cantos by a noble viscount on a
singular subject Abd-el-Kader; and Mr Babbage's

discusses, among other questions connected with the
Exhibition, the yexed one of prices; and in not affixing
these to the goods displayed the author contends that

tunately the utility of his work is neutralised by the
personal matters, which he has mixed up with it. A
prize essay, too, on the Exhibition has made its appear-
ance; and the author of Ten Thousand a Year has

whose merits readers will shortly have an opportunity
of judging. These are but a few among the works

organs of living animals, and especially of man? In
what relation is their development with that of un-
healthy products, and will their natural history, when
well understood, lead to a rational medication?' Among
the questions proposed, to be answered before 1852, is
one-On the presence of arsenie in mineral springs: On

such a scope we shall surely get something worth the
reading.
Have you heard that Boutigny's theory of the
spheroidal condition of water has been in part adopted
as an explanation of the cause of volcanic action? It is
a point on which both chemists and geologists may
exercise their wits. The latter may also cogitate on
the statement put forth by M. Nilson, in a work on the
ethnology of Sweden, that at Fjellbacka, in 58 degrees
35 minutes north latitude, there is a rock which was
two feet below the surface of the water in 1532; seven
to eight inches above in 1662; two feet above in 1742,
and four feet above in 1844-making a rise of six feet
in three hundred years. Besides this, which is, as you
know, a debatable subject, M. Ed. Collomb says, on
another question open to discussion, that the ap-
pearance of ancient glaciers took place at a period less
remote than is commonly supposed. He considers that
'glaciers and floating ice did not exist on our globe at
the paleozoic, jurassic, or cretaceous periods, as no
traces of the action of solid water have been met with
in the strata of these periods. This action commenced
at the close of the tertiary period, and very probably
but a short time before the appearance of man.' Such
glaciers as are at present in existence he regards as
relics of a great phenomenon, whose greatest intensity
corresponds to the period of the dispersion and estab-
lishment of man on the earth.'
'If the air without has a temperature of 59-60 degrees,
no current is observed, and the flame of a lamp held in
a favourable position indicates none.' Mr Silliman
ascertained that there were not two currents flowing in
reverse directions, as at the entrance of a room; and
from observations made by the guide during a consider-
able period, he was satisfied that only one current
existed, and that this flowed out when the external air
was above 60 degrees, and inward when this was below
60 degrees. Going in one day at noon, we found the
outward blast very strong: we prolonged our stay
until past midnight; meanwhile a storm of rain,
accompanied by lightning, had come up, and at three
A.M., when we again emerged, the temperature out-
side had fallen to 50 degrees, and the inward gale blew
so strongly as to extinguish our lights several hun-
dred yards from the mouth. In fact the guide told us,
when more than two miles in the cave, that a change
had taken place in the outer air, and that we should
probably find a storm raging without. His accustomed
senses detected the gentle current inward which we did
not notice at so great a distance; and he perceived, as
he afterwards told us, a change of level in the subter-
ranean rivers since our crossing them in the morning,
the rain, which had fallen copiously, having already
affected them.'
The explanation offered for this phenomenon is, that
as the galleries and avenues of the cave extend for
many miles in different directions through the solid
limestone, there is always a vast collection of air, having
no other outlet than the one chief entrance. The pro-
digious extent of the branching galleries may be inferred
from the fact, that the blast at times continues in one
direction, cither outwards or inwards, for several weeks
together, and occasionally months.
these the only mammal is a rat, covered with fur bluish
in colour, with a white breast, and possessed of dark
black eyes of the size of a rabbit's eye, and entirely
without iris; the feelers also are uncommonly long.
We have satisfied ourselves that he is entirely blind
when first caught, although his eyes are so large and
lustrous. By keeping them, however, in captivity and
diffuse light, they gradually appeared to attain some
power of vision.'

which provides for the improvement of common lodging-
houses. These establishments are to be registered, to
be visited whenever the inspector may think fit, and
cleansed should he so decide; and the proprietors are to
give notice in the proper quarter whenever fever or
contagious disease breaks out among the inmates. A
commendable enactment this. From the published
returns, it appears that 26,813 persons were committed
for trial in 1850, being 1003 fewer than in 1849. Of
these 2578 were transported, 17,602 imprisoned, and 49
executed, leaving some thousands still unaccounted for.
There has been some talk about an account of a
recent exploration of the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,
by Professor Silliman, junior, who, in company with one
of Dr Mantell's sons, visited that remarkable locality.
There is sufficient interest in the details to warrant my
introducing them here by way of conclusion. After
stating that a barometric measurement of the cave shews
it to be 325 feet below the adjoining level, Mr Silliman
Mr Silliman is of opinion that the excavation, or rather
denudation of the Mammoth Cave, is due to the action
of running water, which by some convulsion was sud-
denly drained off to a lower level. His views will help
to set geologists speculating; and until confirmation
comes, we must admit that his statements possess con-
siderable interest, particularly as regards an entirely
new feature.' While traversing the galleries, he says,
the sound of falling water is occasionally heard; and
approaching cautiously to the spot from which the
sound proceeds, we find usually a deep pit often sur-
mounted by a dome. These pits are of various depths,
but mostly not less than one hundred feet, and cut
down with walls of limestone so entirely vertical, that
in many cases we were able to measure them from the

edge with a line and plummet.' These pits or domes
are in some instances 200 or 300 feet deep or high.
At one point of Gorin's Dome, the most remarkable,
the outer diameter of the circle bounding it comes so
close to one of the adjacent galleries, that the thin shell
of interposed rock has been removed for a space two
feet square, through which, as through a window, the
observer may put his head, and obtain an imperfect
glimpse of the interior. You perceive that the loop-
hole through which you look is midway between the
ceiling and the first gallery below; and by a powerful
illumination a tolerable view is obtained of this mono-
lithic structure, built without hands. I was provided
with the means of producing the Drummond light; and
with the guide, my assistant, and Mr Mantell, we suc-
ceeded in making the perilous descent, where only by
groping in the dark over profound chasms could we
find a foothold to a point some hundred feet below the
opening above described. Here we erected the Drum-
mond light, and by its aid obtained the first view of the
lofty ceiling. The dome is of an irregular outline, in
the main ovoidal; and from the ceiling hangs a great
curtain of sculptured and vertically-grooved rock,
unsupported below, with the graceful outline and
apparent lightness of actual drapery. A small stream
of water falls from the top, which is broken into spray
long before it reaches the bottom, and keeps the whole
interior wet with its splashing. No gallery has been
found which leads to the bottom of this most beautiful
dome. We found other similar domes in which the
pendent curtain just described had fallen, and portions
of it but little removed from their original position
seemed poised to a second fall.'
Mr Silliman hints further at mysterious rivers, with
their many-tongued echoes; the mounds of mud and drift
which they annually heap up; the long miles of avenues
which stretch away beyond them, rugged or smooth;
and of the vaulted ceilings, crystal grottos, and gypsum
coronets, which tempt the mineralogist to untiring
exploration.'
THE INNES TRAGEDY. ·
AMONG the family papers belonging to the Duke of
Roxburgh, there is a manuscript history of the House
of Innes of Innes, from which his Grace is descended.
It was printed in 1820, but its circulation is limited to
the small class who occupy themselves in genealogical
inquiries. Among other matters of family history, the
volume contains the following series of incidents, all
connected with each other in a manner to justify the
title we have given to the narrative. We may observe,
that we have seen these events narrated already by an
English genealogist, but without that reference to the
Scottish habits and manners, or that adherence to the
tone of the original which are, we think, necessary to
fully comprehending their tenor and character.
To understand the motives of the actors in this
tragedy, it must be kept in view that the family of
Innes had possessions both in the Highlands and the
Lowlands. The former carried with them the impor-
tant right of chiefship, held by the head of the family.
The estates of Lowland proprietors at that time-the
sixteenth century-followed the regular line of here-
ditary succession; but it was otherwise with the
Highland chiefs. They were a kind of patriarchs
chosen by the clan, and it did not always follow that
the next heir in the hereditary sense was selected. It
often happened when the son of the deceased chief was
a youth that his brother succeeded him. The law,
it is true, was against any such practice; but the civil
courts were not strong enough in the Highlands to
suppress it. The matter was more complicated, how-
ever, when, as in the case of the Innes family, the same
man became both Highland chief and Lowland laird.
The next heir in the feudal sense was the indubitable
possessor of the Lowland estates; and this gave him
so much influence in the Highlands, that it would be
difficult if not vain for any other member of the family
to stand against him for the chiefship. It happened
that a cadet of the family of Innes had acquired an
estate for himself called Cromy. It was always the
desire of such families to accumulate whatever property
might be dispersed among the branches, in the pos-
session of the head of the house; indeed a cadet nearly
related to the owner of a great estate had more influence
and a higher position than in the absolute possession of
a small estate in his own person. It was desirable that
the Innes and the Cromy property should thus both
belong to one owner, and a 'mutual bond of tailie' or
entail was entered into by the two relations, to the
effect that if either died without a son, the whole
property should go to the other. As the Laird of Innes
was childless, Cromy assumed the dignity of being his
representative and the virtual head of the house.
It happened that a Laird of Innes several generations
earlier, called 'Ill Sir Robert, or Wicked Sir Robert,
the brother of the Red Tod,' had three sons-the
eldest, James with the beard;' the second, Walter,
called 'Wyllie Watt; the third, Robert of Drynie.
The descendants of Wyllie Watt acquired the con-
siderable estates of Innermarkie and Balveny. The
representative of the branch had married into the
powerful House of Atholl, and though not so nearly
related to the existing Innes of Innes as Cromy was,
he formed the design of getting himself made head of
the house. In the words of the chronicler: 'The
House of Innermarkic, about this tyme, haveing attained
to the possession of a considerable estate, had for that
reason thought themselves the next in respect to their
cheiff; and finding the family of Innes like to be child-
less, Robert of Innermarkie grudged exceedingly that
Cromy, who was inferior to him in estate, should be
advanced so farr befor him, as he behooved to be by
such a succession.'
The matter was laid before a sort of parliament or
jury of the House of Innes, who decided that their
head Laird John,' as he was called, did rightly in
arranging that the heir-at-law Cromy should be his
successor. Cromy himself, who appears to have been
a chivalrous, gallant fellow, offered to leave the matter
to single combat-to lay the entail on the grass,' and
see if Innermarkie durst take it up.' But open war-
fare was not Innermarkie's nature. He set about
secretly poisoning the car of Laird John against his
representative, shewing how he assumed all the pomp
and circumstance of Laird of Innes, leaving their real
owner no better than a masterless dogg. Laird John,
who seems to have been a weak man, yielded to these
insinuations, and was brought to the point that 'he
would have given anything to have that undone which
was done.' Then came out the dark design of the
treacherous kinsman. Innermarky haveing once thus
possesst him, told him that it was impossible he could
recover what he was cheatted out of any other way
but by killing of Cromy, who certainly would never
part with what he had gotten but with his life. And
if he pleased to concur with him, he would be the doer
of the thing himselfe, be the hazard what it lyk'd-he
would undertake it rather than see his cheiff made a
slave as he was.'
The design of the murder took full possession of
Innermarkie's mind, and he carefully watched all the
motions of his victim, that he might fall on him apart
from the usual attendant followers who generally then
accompanied a northern chief. In April 1580, Cromy's
son, who was at college in Aberdeen, fell ill, and his
father went to visit him. Innermarkie, ascertaining
where he lived, collected a band of his followers, and
stealthily entered the town. At that time every consi-
derable town in Scotland was a sort of battle-fieid,
where the neighbouring families fought out their feuds.

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
In the country each kept to his own territory and his
own castle; but when they repaired to the town on
business or pleasure, they must needs come in contact
with each other, and they could not do so without
bloodshed. The confusions thus occasioned gave ample
opportunities for such crimes as Innermarkic desired to
perpetrate. There was at that time a feud between the
Gordons and the Forbeses. Cromy was a partisan of
the former; and as the courtyard of the house where
he lived had been carelessly left open, his enemy knew
that he had nothing to do but to raise the Gordon
rallying-cry within the court. Accordingly Cromy,
hearing shouts of Help-help! a Gordon-a Gordon!'
ran down half dressed to a postern opening to the court.
He had no sooner opened it than Innermarkie, who was
prepared with his matchlock, shot him, and the followers
rushing on him, despatched him with their dirks.
The old Laird of Innes had accompanied Inner-
markie on his murderous expedition, probably in the
belief that his intention went no farther in the mean-
time than coercion. At all events, he seems not to
have been prepared for so tragic a scene. Innermarkie
swore, however, that he should be as deep in it as any
of them; and taking one of the dirks which had stuck
in the body of the murdered man, he held it to the old
man's throat, and threatened to plunge it into him if he
did not strike the body with his dagger, and so,' says
the chronicler, 'compelled him to draw his dagger, and
stab it up to the hilt in the body of his nearest rela-
tion, and the bravest that bore his name. After his
example, all who were there behooved to do the like,
that all might be alike guilty. Yea, in prosecution
of this, it has been told me, that Mr John Innes,
afterwards Coxtoun, being a youth then at school,
was raised out of his bed, and compelled by Inner-
markie to stab a dagger into the dead body, that
the more might be under the same condemnation.'
The next object of the murderers was to despatch the
sick youth, Cromy's son and representative. They had,
however, lost time with the dagger scene, and by the
connivance of some neighbours he had escaped by a
secret passage- the Lord in his providence,' says the
chronicler, preserving him for the executing of ven-
geance for these murtherers for the blood of his father.'
The next object was to get hold of the entail, which
was of course safe in Cromy's own fortalice. They took
the dead man's signet-ring, and having got over one of
his followers to their side, sent him with it on one of
Cromy's horses, to desire the lady of Cromy to send the
charter-chest instantly with the bearer, as it was so
urgently needed that her husband had not time to send
a written order for it-a tedious operation sometimes
to a Highland laird. Though it troubled the woman
much,' says the chronicler, to receive so blind a
message, yet her husband's ring, his own servant, and
his horse, prevailed so with her, together with the man's
importunity to be gone, that she delivered to him what
he sought, and let him go.'
6
It happened that there was present a young relation
of the family, called Alexander Innes, of Cotts, a com-
panion and friend of the lady's sick son. He was
exceedingly anxious to pay a visit to his friend, and
believing this to be a good opportunity, desired the
man to give him a seat on his horse. The man refused
with a sternness and determination inconsistent with
the habits of one in his position, and the youth becoming
exasperated, the man, in his attempts to explain and
apologise, fell into a series of inconsistencies and con-
tradictions, which made young Alexander resolve to
accompany him at all hazards. Accordingly, he waited
at a spot at a small distance from the door where the
man required to ride past, and in the darkness leaped
on behind him. The man drew his dirk, but Alexander
snatched it from him, and in his fury buried it in his
bosom. He returned to the house with the charter-
chest, and had scarcely set it down when a messenger
from Aberdeen told of the tragedy that had been perpe-
trated.
The lady immediately fled to Edinburgh with the
precious documents in her possession, and sought the
protection of her kinsman, Lord Elphinston, the high
treasurer. But Innermarkie had his friends, who
rallied round him, and in the name of the old laird
he kept for some time possession of the estates of
Innes. He had no difficulty in getting the chief to
execute various documents in his own favour, but
nothing could obviate the fact, that Cromy's son was
not only the next heir, but was in possession of previous
documents which could not be recalled. The young
man in the meantime made favour with the lord trea-
surer, and married his daughter. This put the pre-
ponderance decidedly in his favour. He obtained a
sentence of outlawry against his father's murderer,
and was authorised to proceed northward with letters
of fire and sword against him-a sort of general com-
mission to hunt an outlaw-and kill or take him, break-
ing through all impediments. As to Innermarkie,'
says the chronicler, he was forced for awhile to take
to the hills, and when he wearied of that, he had a
retreat of difficult access within the house of Edin-
glassie, where he sleeped in little enough security; for
in September 1584 his house was surprised by Laird
Robert, and that retireing-place of his first entered by
Alexander Innes, afterwards of Cotts, the same who
some years before had killed the servant who came
from Innermarkie with the false token for the writs,
and who all his life was called Craig-in-Perrill (throat
in peril) for venturing upon Innermarkie, then despe-
rate.' The murderer was despatched at once, like a
wolf found in his hole. His head was cut off, and taken
as an acceptable present to the widow of the victim.
She in her turn, properly appreciating its value, sent it
to Edinburgh, to be laid at the feet of the king-' a
thing too masculine,' says the chronicler, to be com-
mended in a woman.'
CURIOUS ZOOPHYTE.
Sir John Graham Dalyell, Bart. of Binns (under
whose ancestor, in the time of Charles II, originated the
celebrated cavalry regiment of Scots Greys), has lately
devoted two elaborate and profusely, as well as delicately
illustrated quarto volumes, to the rare and remarkable
animals of Scotland, being chiefly the zoophytes, some of
them fresh-water specimens, but the major part derived
from the Firth of Forth-as, for example, the simple
tubularia, or 'oaten-pipe coralline' (Tubularia indivisa),
an animal product, resembling a flourishing vegetable,
dwelling at the depth of thirty or forty feet from the
surface of the sea, with a living head resembling a fine
scarlet blossomn, and often pendent, cluster-like grapes,
and having the ornamental aspect of a strict resemblance
to a bouquet of vivid flowers from the hand of nature.
These creatures, by the way, are generally found on
shells, entire or decayed, empty or tenanted. A brilliant
group was on one occasion seen on a shell carried along
by the crawling inhabitant.-Fyfe's Summer Life on Land

THE PROPHETIC THOUGHT.
CHILDREN are a prophecy. They contain in themselves
the yet unrolled future, and they contain, too, the pre-
disposing causes which give that future its general form
and contour, and even its hues and tints. Coming out
of one infinity, and going into another, they receive
from the Divine Hand the endowments which stamp
life with its image. If every one has a character of his
own, the mould of that character is born with him, and
in him; and he can no more depart from the type than
he can throw off his humanity. And if the varieties
of character are endless, then, in all their minute and
mingling shades, their causes and occasions are innate
-as much a part of a man's primal being as are the
impulses which determine the colour of his skin, fix
the outline of his features, and form and mould his
stature. Circumstances are powerful, but theirs is
only a secondary influence in human life: they yield to
the internal pressure of the soul. They may encroach,
on the weak, and become masters of the wicked, but it
is a usurped dominion they exert-they have no legiti-
mate throne; and for their deposition, it is needful only
that the rightful heir should awake to the consciousness
of his prerogatives.
Children are a prophecy. Their future they in each
case bring with them into the world, as much as the
rosebud, the sapling oak, the callow lark.
This prophecy, like others, is difficult to read. Chil-
dren cannot read their own prophecy-who can read it
for them? No one perfectly, very few well, most not
at all. In order to read the prophecy, you must know
the characters in which it is written. In that book of
God every component element of each one's life is
written down. But it is a sealed volume, although some
transcripts therefrom are imprinted on the infant soul.
Who has the eye to discern and the skill to decipher
those dim and scattered characters? In them is The
Prophetic Thought of each one's life. A babe lately
struck my attention as it lay in its sister's arms. I
believe it was the broad contrast between the two that
attracted my eye. The babe itself was very lovely.
Of pure Saxon blood, its large light-blue eyes, flaxen
hair, and fair oval face, afforded the sweetest sight I
had seen for many a day: blood of darker hue flowed
in the veins of its nurse, whose face was commonplace,
and almost mean. Broad as was the physical contrast
between the sisters, yet more diverse was their attire,
as well as their general appearance. The infant, clean
in its person, was clad in white garments which might
have been bleached on the Alps; the girl, with hands
and face begrimed in dirt, wore an old woollen dress, in
which rags and stains seemed to strive for the mastery.
PRICE 1d.
Attracted by the singularity, I stopped to take a
closer view of the two children; when out of the deep
liquid ether of the infant's eye issued and glanced away
a look which, for a child's look, was full of meaning,
and struck me as a prophecy of that child's history.
'Yes,' I said to myself, thy future is there; dimly dost
thou see it: in no distinct consciousness does it stand
before thec, but I discern its general outlines-I know
what thou wilt be.'
4
It is what the infant will be I know, not what it will
do. Whom it will marry I know not; where it will
dwell I know not; the number of its children I know
not: yet I can tell its fortune I have discovered its
prophetic thought. I know, therefore, what will be the
great bearing of its life.
Before I attempt to lay down its horoscope, I will
explain myself a little as to the nature and efficacy of
this prophetic thought, which, as I have intimated,
envelops the future of that child, and of every child.
Systems of philosophy have each their prophetic
thought. The imaginative which predominates in
Plato laid down by anticipation the history of the
Platonic philosophy; and in like manner in the com-
mon sense of Socrates was the germinating principle of
his influence. If you had heard Plato lecture in the
Academy, if you had seen the fire of his eye, marked
the deep tones of his eloquence, observed how, his chest
swelled, and his figure became erect, on occasions when
he was under the inspiration of a great thought, you
would then have known what impression his writings
would make on the world-who would be his admirers,
who his opponents. Not more certain is the chemist of
the result when he puts oxygen and hydrogen together
in one vessel, than might you have been that those
words would have affinity for men of soaring thoughts,
and delicate sensibilities, and refined speculations-with
the elements of whose soul they would blend and unite,
adding fuel to fire,' until, as with a hot iron, they
would burn their own likeness on individuals, systems,
and institutions.
All great men have their prophetic thought, which is
a condensed summary of their lives. The classics were
aware of the truth which we are endeavouring to
expound. Accordingly they made the infaut Hercules
strangle a serpent while yet in his cradle, and tell how
bees gave sweetness to the infant lips of Plato. Could
we see and study the features of illustrious men ere
they left their mothers' arms, we should discern their
essential qualities, and be able to lay down the chief
outline of their history. Those smiles that pass across
the countenance of the sleeping babe are sparklings of
the heavenly waters of its soul; they are flashes from
the past into the future: rending the veil of the inner

temple, they shew things to come in the shadowy light | Norman. But inborn qualities are very numerous. By
of things that are.
Some illustration and enforcement of our views may
be found in the great diversities which children present
in the cradle and the nursery, and long before the out-
ward can have had any marked influence on their
characters. Of the existence of these diversities every
thoughtful mother is well aware. I have myself
observed them in great number. Indeed every child
may be said to have moral and intellectual qualities
peculiar to itself; and so intimately interwoven with
the fibres of his being are these qualities, that they
make him what he is-forming his disposition, giving
expression to his features, and determining even the
tones of his voice. Any attempt to classify and de-
scribe these idiosyncrasies must fail-so minute as
well as numerous are they, and so imperfect an organ
is language when it has to speak of spiritual realities.
Look round your own family, and you will understand
what I cannot set forth. And in your fears for this
child, and your hopes for that child, in the choice of a
profession which already you have half-made for a son
who yet sits on the lowest form in the school, you have
divined the prophetic thought of each, and believe in it
so firmly that you act under its suggestions.
nature some persons are melancholy, just as some are
scrofulous. The melancholy temperament forebodes
sorrow, as much as the scrofulous constitution threatens
idiocy: why should the one or the other be transmitted
and perpetuated? If allowed, may not the evil gain pre-
ponderance, and the race become incurably degraded?
Temperament and constitution ought to be regarded
in marriages far more than a pretty face or a large for-
tune. 'Of good blood?' Yes, would see my own
children marry none but such as are of good blood; but
then by blood I do not mean 'men of blood,' warriors
of ancient renown, and nobles who have the felicity of
knowing the names, and it may be the features, of their
grandsons fifty times removed; but by blood I mean a
good stock,' a healthful and vigorous race, a virtuous
and cultivated family. I add the last qualification
because, beyond a doubt, moral tendencies of a more or
less decided kind are propagated from father to son.
These facts seem to declare that education requires
to be enforced, regarded, and cultivated in a new aspect.
The education of the race-in plain English, the im-
provement of the breed in man-demands and must
receive attention, else society is now pregnant with a
thought prophetic of a fearful doom.
If in our birth we are all big with our future selves,
parents at the earliest day should study, learn, and
watch the prophetic thought of each of their children.
Very soon is there some manifestation thereof. One
child will bite and kick, another child will sulk, if
pre-interfered with. This child is forgiving, that child
is vindictive. See what an affectionate nature shines
forth in the eyes and looks of that little girl! That
boy has the soul of a braggadocio, and that other
possesses the self-denial and generosity of a hero.
Do not all these qualities require cultivation? Some
may be encouraged, others must be restrained; and
others again must be counteracted, overcome-nay,
eradicated. A wise parent has now to soften a
disposition, now to give firmness and strength to
a character. Here restraint is required, there im-
pulse. In all cases proportion and harmony are of
great consequence: what is weak should be fostered,
what is defective should be supplemented, what is low
should be raised, what is gross should be refined; all
excess should be pruned away; and head, heart, and
soul should be brought into a well-balanced and effec-
tive operation. If so high a work is to be accomplished,
it must be begun in the very first days of our earthly
existence.
Would that its mother and its father could discover
and respect the prophetic thought of that infant whom
I left nestling in its sister's arms! No ordinary history
lies in embryo in its bosom. The first germs of that
history may have to be sought in the blood of some
distant Saxon dame-so linked to the past is our
sent life; and the remotest branches of that history
run out into a futurity which no human being can
measure, so close on the infinite does the soul of man
press. But who shall estimate the weal and the wo
which lie between these two extremes? Who shall
say which will be the greater? Intense in that child's
case will both be-the joy exquisite, the wo terrible.
No, I cannot tell whether she will be an actress, and
marry a coronet, or prove a castaway, and perish while
yet little more than a girl. But I do know that hers will
be no common lot. Her sister may become a kitchen-
maid, and marry a chimney-sweep. She herself is both
lovely and loving: lovely and loving will she long
remain. As she is loving, so will she be loved. Such
a soul as hers will burn with affection: some return,
a large return it will exact. Will it be a pure return?
I see that sweet child again. No longer innocent,
she sits in the corner of a prison, her face towards the
door, as if to salute the comer with a look of defiance.
As I contemplate her face, the prophetic thought passes
in thick shadows over her brow. Once, again, in a
thousand times her past determines her future; and
force having done its best, or rather its worst, and
found no response in a heart which would have an-
swered to the lightest touch of love, she is set on shore
in a distant land, and falls a prey to the degradations
of a penal colony. Thus a human spirit which might
have become an angel has to stand before its Maker in
the attributes of a demon.
This paper has its prophetic thought. I have written
it because I have a burden for the public. If the man
lies folded up in the infant, as the oak in the acorn,
then the condition which is first in time is first also in
importance. Whence comes our infantine condition?
From sources of influence over which we have no
immediate control, but also from sources which in pro-
cess of time we may at least modify. The Saxon blood
in that infant's veins came without the will of man;
but the will of man may in time to come determine
whether more of the Teutonic or more of the Celtic
peculiarity shall enter into generations that will be
born. To some extent we of this age hold future ages
in our hands, for we have an option as to what quali-
ties we will propagate. In these remarks I have con-
fined myself to general qualities-the Saxon and the
REMINISCENCES OF AN ATTORNEY.
THE PUZZLE.
TEMPUS FUGIT! The space of but a few brief yester-
days seems to have passed since the occurrence of the
following out-of-the-way incidents-out-of-the-way
even in our profession, fertile as it is in startling expe-
riences; and yet the faithful and unerring tell-tale
and monitor, Anno Domini 1851, instructs me that a
quarter of a century has nearly slipped by since the
first scene in the complicated play of circumstances
opened upon me. The date I remember well, for the
Tower guns had been proclaiming with their thunder-
throats the victory of Navarino but a short time
before a clerk announced, William Martin, with a
message from Major Stewart.'
This William Martin was a rather sorry curiosity in
his way. He was now in the service of our old client
Major Stewart; and a tall, good-looking fellow enough,
spite of a very decided cast in his eyes, which the
rascal, when in his cups- no unusual occurrence-
declared he had caught from his former masters-

exceedingly yellow East India director; and his son,

Mr Henry Thorneycroft, with whom, until lately trans-
ferred to Major Stewart's service, he had lived from
infancy-his mother and father having formed part of
the elder Thorneycroft's establishment when he was
born. He had a notion in his head that he had better
blood in his veins than the world supposed, and was
excessively fond of aping the gentleman; and this he
did, I must say, with the ease and assurance of a stage-
player. His name was scarcely out of the clerk's lips
when he entered the inner office with a great effort at
steadiness and deliberation, closed the door very care-
fully and importantly, hung his hat with much precision
on a brass peg, and then steadying himself by the door-
handle, surveyed the situation and myself with staring
lack-lustre eyes and infinite gravity. I saw what was
the matter.
'You have been in the "Sun," Mr Martin ?'
A wink, inexpressible by words, replied to me, and
I could see by the motion of the fellow's lips that
speech was attempted; but it came so thick that it
was several minutes before I made out that he meant
to say the British had been knocking the Turks about
like bricks, and that he had been patriotically drinking
the healths of the said British or bricks.
'Have the goodness, sir, to deliver your message, and
then instantly leave the office.'
'Old Tho-o-o-rney,' was the hiccoughed reply, 'has
smoked the the plot. Young Thorney's done for.
Ma-a-aried in a false name: tra-ansportation-of
course.'
'What gibberish is this about old Thorney and
young Thorney? Do you not come from Major
Stewart ?'
'Ye-e-es, that's right: the route's arrived for the
old trump: wishes to-to see you.'
'Major Stewart dying! Why you are a more dis-
graceful scamp than I believed you to be. Send this
fellow away,' I added to a clerk who answered my
summons. I then hastened off, and was speedily
rattling over the stones towards Baker Street, Portman
Square, where Major Stewart resided. As I left the
office I heard Martin beg the clerk to lead him to the
pump previous to sending him off-no doubt for the
purpose of sobering himself somewhat previous to
reappearing before the major, whose motives for hiring
or retaining such a fellow in his modest establishment
I could not at all understand.
The
'You were expected more than an hour ago,' said
Dr Hampton, who was just leaving the house.
major is now, I fear, incapable of business.'
There was no time for explanation, and I hastily
entered the sick-chamber. Major Stewart, though
rapidly sinking, recognised me; and in obedience to a
gesture from her master the aged, weeping house-
keeper left the room. The major's daughter, Rosa-
mond Stewart, had been absent with her aunt, her
father's maiden sister, on a visit, I understood, to some
friends in Scotland, and had not, I concluded, been
made acquainted with the major's illness, which had
only assumed a dangerous character a few days pre-
viously. The old soldier was dying calmly and pain-
lessly-rather from exhaustion of strength, a general
failure of the powers of life, than from any especial
disease. A slight flush tinged the mortal pallor of his
face as I entered, and the eyes emitted a slightly-
reproachful expression.
It is not more, my dear sir,' I replied softly but
eagerly to his look, than a quarter of an hour ago
that I received your message.'
I do not know whether he comprehended or even
distinctly heard what I said, for his feeble but ex-
tremely anxious glance was directed whilst I spoke to
a large oil-portrait of Rosamond Stewart, suspended
over the mantelpiece. The young lady was a splendid,
dark-eyed beauty, and of course the pride and darling
of her father. Presently wrenching, as it were, his
eyes from the picture, he looked in my face with great
earnestness, and bending my ear close to his lips, I
heard him feebly and brokenly say, 'A question to
ask you, that's all read-read!' His hand motioned
towards a letter which lay open on the bed: I ran it
over, and the major's anxiety was at once explained.
Rosamond Stewart had, I found, been a short time
previously married in Scotland to Henry Thorney-
croft, the son of the wealthy East India director.
Finding his illness becoming serious, the major had
anticipated the time and mode in which the young
people had determined to break the intelligence to the
irascible father of the bridegroom, and the result was
the furious and angry letter in reply which I was
perusing. Mr Thorneycroft would never, he declared,
recognise the marriage of his undutiful nephew
nephew, not son; for he was, the letter announced, the
child of an only sister, whose marriage had also mortally
offended Mr Thorneyroft, and had been brought up
from infancy as his (Mr Thorneycroft's) son, in order
that the hated name of Allerton, to which the boy was
alone legally entitled, might never offend his ear.
There was something added insinuative of a doubt of
the legality of the marriage, in consequence of the
misnomer of the bridegroom at the ceremony.
--
'One question,' muttered the major as I finished the
perusal of the letter: 'Is Rosamond's marriage legal?'
'No question about it. How could any one suppose
that an involuntary misdescription can affect such a
contract?'
'Enough-enough!' he gasped. A great load is
gone!-the rest is with God. Beloved Rosamond'-
The slight whisper was no longer audible; sighs,
momently becoming fainter and weaker, followed-
ceased, and in little more than ten minutes after the
last word was spoken life was extinct. I rang the
bell, and turned to leave the room, and as I did so
surprised Martin on the other side of the bed. He had
been listening, screened by the thick damask curtains,
and appeared to be a good deal sobered. I made no
remark, and proceeded on down stairs.
The man
followed, and as soon as we had gained the hall said
quickly, yet hesitatingly, Sir-sir!'
'Well, what have you to say?'
'Nothing very particular, sir. But did I understand
you to say just now that it was of no consequence if a
man married in a false name?'
"That depends upon circumstances. Why do you
ask?'
'Oh, nothing—nothing: only I have heard it's trans-
portation, especially if there's money.'
'Perhaps you are right. Anything else?'
'No,' said he, opening the door: that's all-mere
curiosity.'
I heard nothing more of the family for some time,
except with reference to Major Stewart's personal pro-
perty, about L.4000, bequeathed to his daughter, with
a charge thereon of an annuity of L.20 a year for Mrs
Leslie, the aged housekeeper; the necessary business
connected with which we transacted. But about a
twelvemonth after the major's death, the marriage of
the elder Thorneycroft with a widow of the same
name as himself, and a cousin, the paper stated, was
announced; and pretty nearly a year and a half subse-
quent to the appearance of this ominous paragraph, the
decease of Mr Henry Thorneycroft at Lausanne in
Switzerland, who had left, it was added in the news-

two sons to mourn their irreparable loss. Silence
again, as far as we were concerned, settled upon the
destinies of the descendants of our old military client,
till one fine morning a letter from Dr Hampton informed
us of the sudden death by apoplexy, a few days pre-
viously, of the East India director. Dr Hampton
further hinted that he should have occasion to write
us again in a day or two, relative to the deceased's

We did not quite comprehend the drift of this curious
epistle; but although not specially instructed, we deter-
mined to at once write to Mrs Rosamond Thorneycroft
or Allerton, who with her family was still abroad, and
in the meantime take such formal steps in her behalf
as might appear necessary.oT i wyraz ml bild
We were not long in doubt as to the motives of the
extremely civil application to ourselves on the part of
the widow of the East India director. The deceased's
wealth had been almost all invested in land, which
went, he having died intestates to his nephew's son,
Henry Allerton; and the personals in which the widow
would share were consequently of very small amount,
Mrs Thorneycroft was therefore anxious to propose,
through us, a more satisfactory and equitable arrange-
ment. We could of course say nothing till the arrival
of Mrs Rosamond Allerton, for which, however, we had
only a brief time to wait. There were, we found, no
indisposition on that lady's part to act with generosity

person, by the way, of about forty years of age but
there was a legal difficulty in the way, in consequence
of the heir-at-law, being a minor, Mrs Thorneycroft
became at length terribly incensed, and talked a good
deal of angry nonsense about disputing the claim of
Henry Allerton's son to the estates, on the ground, that
his marriage, having been contracted in a wrong name,
was null and void. Several annoying paragraphs got
in consequence into the Sunday newspapers, and these
brought about a terrible disclosure, divine pg olds
About twelve o'clock one day, the Widow Thorney-

You are mistaken, sir,' rejoined the clergyman
mildly. This young woman was certainly married by
me at Swindon Church, Wilts, to a gentleman of the
name of Henry Thorneyeroft, who, it appears from
the newspapers, confirmed by this lady, was no other
than Mr Henry Allerton. This marriage, we find,
took place six months previously to, that contracted
with Rosamond Stewart. I have further to say that
this young woman, Maria Emsbury, is a very respect,
able person, and that her marriage-portion, of a little
more than eight hundred pounds, was given to her hus-
band, whom she has only seen thrice since her marriage,
to support himself till the death of his reputed father,
constantly asserted by him to be imminent.'

your opinion quite satisfactory; but there is one slight
matter which I fancy you will find somewhat difficult

high-minded and beautiful daughter of Major Stewart.
The Widow Thorneycroft's exultation was exuberant.

Well, Mr Henry Thorneycroft or Allerton was at
the time this marriage took place on a visit to that
gentleman; and I myself saw the bridegroom, whom I
had united a fortnight previously in Swindon church,
walking arm-and-arm with Mr Angerstein in Sydney

recognised both distinctly, and bowed. Mr Angerstein
returned my salutation, and he recollects, the circum-

They were about to leave, when, as ill-luck would
have it, one of the clerks who, deceived by the momen-

the unwelcome visitors arrived, believed we were dis-

that as it was quite apparent we were determined to
defend the usurpation by Miss Rosamond Stewart-a

expedite as he ought to have done the packing intrusted

to his care. I was vexed at this, as the Widow Thor-
neycroft, her protégée, and the Rev. Mr Wishart,
accompanied by a solicitor, were shortly expected; and
it was desirable that a meeting of the antagonistic
parties should be avoided. I descended to the lower
regions to remonstrate with and hurry Martin, and
found, as I feared, that his former evil habits had
returned upon him. It was not yet twelve o'clock, and
he was already partially intoxicated, and pale, trem-
bling, and nervous from the effects, it was clear to me,
of the previous night's debauch.
'Your mistress is grossly deceived in you!' I angrily
exclaimed; and if my advice were taken, you would
be turned out of the house at once without a character.
There, don't attempt to bamboozle me with that non-
sense; I've seen fellows crying drunk before now.'
He stammered out some broken excuses, to which I
very impatiently listened; and so thoroughly muddled
did his brain appear, that he either could not or would
not comprehend the possibility of Mrs Allerton and her
children being turned out of house and home, as he
expressed it, and over and over again asked me if
nothing could yet be done to prevent it. I was com-
pletely disgusted with the fellow, and sharply bidding
him hasten his preparations for departure, rejoined the
ladies, who were by this time assembled in the back
drawing-room, ready shawled and bonneted for their
journey. It was a sad sight. Rosamond Stewart's
splendid face was shadowed by deep and bitter grief,
borne, it is true, with pride and fortitude; but it was
easy to see its throbbing pulsations through all the
forced calmness of the surface. Her aunt, of a weaker
nature, sobbed loudly in the fulness of her grief; and
the children, shrinking instinctively in the chilling
atmosphere of a great calamity, clung, trembling and
half terrified, the eldest especially, to their mother. I
did not insult them with phrases of condolence, but
turned the conversation, if such it could be called, upon
their future home and prospects in Switzerland. Some
time had thus elapsed when my combative propensities
were suddenly aroused by the loud dash of a carriage
to the door, and the peremptory rat-tat-tat which fol
lowed. I felt my cheek flame as I said: 'They demand
admittance as if in possession of an assured, decided
right. It is not yet too late to refuse possession, and
take the chances of the law's uncertainty.'
'See Miss Emsbury!' exclaimed the Widow Thorney-
croft, recovering her speech: there is no such person
here!'
Pardon me, madam,' I cried, catching eagerly at
the interruption, as a drowning man is said to do at a
straw: 'this young person was at least Miss Emsbury.
Desire the officer to walk up.' The butler vanished
instantly, and we all huddled back disorderly into the
drawing-room, some one closing the door after us. I
felt the grasp of Mrs Allerton's arm tighten convulsively
round mine, and her breath I heard came quick and
short. I was hardly less agitated myself.
Steps-slow and deliberate steps were presently
heard ascending the stairs, the door opened, and in
walked a gentleman in the uniform of a yeomanry
officer, whom at the first glance I could have sworn to
be the deceased Mr Henry Allerton. A slight excla-
mation of terror escaped Mrs Allerton, followed by a
loud hysterical scream from the Swindon young woman,
as she staggered forward towards the stranger, exclaim-
ing: 'Oh merciful God!-my husband!' and then fell,
overcome with emotion, in his outstretched arms.
•
"Yes,' said the Rev. Mr Wishart promptly, that is
certainly the gentleman I united to Maria Emsbury,
What can be the meaning of this scene?'
"Is that sufficient, Mr Sharp?' exclaimed the officer
in a voice that removed all doubt.
1
'Quite, quite,' I shouted more than enough !'
"Very well, then,' said William Martin, dashing off
his black curling wig, removing his whiskers of the
same colour, and giving his own light, but now cropped,
head of hair and clean-shaved checks to view. Now,
then, send for the police, and let them transport me
I richly merit it. I married this young woman in a false
name; I robbed her of her money, and I deserve the
hulks, if anybody ever did.'
You might have heard a pin drop in the apartment
whilst the repentant rascal thus spoke; and when he
ceased, Mrs Allerton, unable to bear up against the
tumultuous emotion which his words excited, sank
without breath or sensation upon a sofa. Assistance
was summoned; and whilst the as yet imperfectly-
informed servants were running from one to another
with restoratives, I had leisure to look around. The
Widow Thorneycroft, who had dropped into a chair, sat
gazing in bewildered dismay upon the stranger, who
still held her lately-discovered niece-in-law in his arms;
and I could see the hot perspiration which had gathered
on her brow run in large drops down the white channels
which they traced through the thick rouge of her
tri-cheeks. But the reader's fancy will supply the best
image of this unexpected and extraordinary scene.
cleared the house of intruders and visitors as speedily
as possible, well assured that matters would now adjust
themselves without difficulty.
Mrs Allerton shook her head with decisive meaning.
'I could not bear it,' she said in a tone of sorrowful
gentleness. 'But I trust we shall not be intruded
upon.'
I hurried out of the apartment, and met the
umphant claimants. I explained the cause of the delay,
and suggested that Mrs Thorneycroft and her friends
could amuse themselves in the garden whilst the soli-
citor and I ran over the inventory of the chief valuables
to be surrendered together.
This was agreed to. A minute or two before the
conclusion of this necessary formality, I received a
message from the ladies, expressive of a wish to be
gone at once, if I would escort them to the hotel; and
Martin, who was nowhere to be found, could follow. I
hastened to comply with their wishes; and we were
just about to issue from the front drawing-room, into
which we had passed through the folding-doors, when
we were confronted by the widow and her party, who
had just reached the landing of the great staircase.
We drew back in silence. The mutual confusion into
which we were thrown caused a momentary hesitation
only, and we were passing on when the butler suddenly
appeared.
A gentleman,' he said, an officer, is at the door,
who wishes to see a Miss Maria Emsbury, formerly of
Swindon.'
I stared at the man, discerned a strange expression
in his face, and it glanced across me at the same
moment that I had heard no knock at the door.
I
And so it proved. Martin was not sent to the hulks,
though no question that he amply deserved a punish-
ment as great as that. The self-sacrifice, as he deemed
it, which he at last made, pleaded for him, and so did
his pretty-looking wife; and the upshot was, that the
mistaken bride's dowry was restored, with something
over, and that a tavern was taken for them in Picca-
dilly-the White Bear I think it was-where they
lived comfortably and happily, I have heard, for a con-
siderable time, and having considerably added to their
capital, removed to a hotel of a higher grade in the
City, where they now reside. It was not at all sur-
prising that the clergyman and others had been deceived.
The disguise, and Martin's imitative talent, might have
misled persons on their guard, much more men unsus-
picious of deception. The cast in the eyes, as well as
a general resemblance of features, also of course greatly
aided the imposture.
Of Mrs Rosamond Allerton, I have only to say, for
it is all I know, that she is rich, unwedded, and still
splendidly beautiful, though of course somewhat passée

compared with herself twenty years since. Happy, too,
I have no doubt she is, judging from the placid bright-
ness of her aspect the last time I saw her beneath the
transept of the Crystal Palace, on the occasion of its
opening by the Queen. I remember wondering at the
time if she often recalled to mind the passage in her
life which I have here recorded.
NON-TELESCOPIC VIEW OF THE ECLIPSE.
A COMPLETE eclipse of the sun is a very exciting event
for the astronomers; but there are others who take as
great an interest in knowing how the earth and its
denizens behave themselves under the dispensation.
Of such is Mr Robert Chambers, who has sent from
Gottenburg in Sweden to the Edinburgh Evening
Courant' a non-astronomical view of the scene, which
we are in hopes may be satisfactory to many of our
readers. We all know how unphilosophically the lower
animals are said to have conducted themselves on the
last occasion of the kind-the oxen, for instance, form-
ing into a circle in the middle of a field with their horns
outwards, as if they had believed with the Chinese that
Eclipse was a monster in the act of swallowing the
sun. It is pleasant to think that these animals have
ruminated to some purpose since then, and that at
Gottenburg they went coolly on with their dinner during
the progress of the phenomenon. We wish we could
say as much for the diffusion of enlightenment among
their human masters; but we must let our friend tell
the story in his own words.
1
The intrusion of the non-scientific being deprecated
by all the philosophie observers, I resolved to head
what I called a Zoological Section, to be placed in some
convenient spot where the general effect might be well
seen, and where we should have opportunities of watch
ing the conduct of the lower animals during the pro-
gress of the phenomenon. We found a suitable place
in the fertile island opposite to Klippen, about three
miles from Gottenburg, an eminence about a hundred
feet above the sea, where cattle, horses, pigs, and geese
were feeding. Here we took our station at two o'clock.
Besides hand-telescopes and lorgnettes, with slips of
dimmed glass, we had no philosophical instruments
except a thermometer to determine any change of tem-
perature which might take place, and a compass to
ascertain the meridian line, with a view to our use of a
small chart of the position of the stars and planets with
which Mr Swan had furnished us. There being few
loftier eminences near Gottenburg, we had here a toler-
ably full view of the sky in all directions.
1 At about five minutes to three o'clock, which had
been calculated as the local time for the commencement
of the eclipse, we detected the first intrusion of the
moon's body upon the western limb of the sun, and from
that time an extraordinary excitement prevailed in our
party. The dulling of the daylight was soon detected.
Then the wind, which blew briskly, was felt to be
chilly. Glasses were handed from one to another, that
each person might have an opportunity of trying all.
Remarks on the amount of the sun's body obscured, on
his appearance as he gradually assumed a crescent
form, and on the slightly-ragged character of the edge
of the moon, passed between us. I kept a good watch
upon the animals round about; but cows, pigs, horses,
and geese all alike continued to feed, as if nothing
unusual were impending. In the midst of my anxiety
on this subject, the neighbouring farmer sent boys to
drive home his cows, thinking that they would be safer
there, and, notwithstanding our remonstrances, we lost
the attendance of those ruminants. After all, they
were left out close to the house, and a lady was good
enough to take her station there to observe them.
It may be readily imagined that as the moment of
total obscuration approached the excitement waxed in
intensity. It was indeed scarcely possible at that time
to maintain anything like coolness, so anxious were we
all to make the best use of the short time which we
knew was to be allowed to us. A great dulness had
now taken possession of the landscape, and settled
in ghastly fashion upon every upturned countenance.
Yet, while even a very thin slip of the sun's body
remained out he maintained a very considerable bright-
ness, and the sky in that quarter was full of light.
The degree of illumination over the face of the country
seemed to me much the same as that which prevailed
during the annular eclipse of 1836. It was a good
twilight, but of a very peculiar hue, and shedding a
sort of horror over external nature, instead of the
usual soft shades of evening. On the whole, however,
there was less darkness up to this time than might
have been anticipated. I could almost say that the
change of the temperature was more intrusive upon
our observation. The thermometer had sunk from
672 to 59° Fahrenheit, and the ladies had all found it
necessary to invest themselves in shawls and cloaks.
The last thing which I remember observing just
before the sun was wholly covered, was the deep gloom
of the sky in the north-west-a frown like that which
heralds the most dreadful storm. The moment of the
totality was a striking one, for the transition from the
considerable light described to that very much reduced
amount which attended complete obscuration, was
extremely abrupt.
At one stride comes the dark.'
We suddenly found ourselves able to look at the sun
(so to speak) with the naked eye. There we were,
gazing fearfully on the wondrous object in the western
sky, while exclamations of wonder and awe burst
confusedly from every lip. It was, as it were, a black
sun with the usual corona of radiation flaming around
it; but only for a short space, and the colour changed
to a blue livid tint. Some were eager at this moment
to detect the stars, others to observe the conduct of the
animals; but in the fluttering horror of the scene, and
the intense solicitude about the brevity of the opportu
nity, less was done than we could have wished. We
readily found Venus, which was a little way below the
sun, to the right; but I vainly looked for Mercury
equidistant in the opposite direction. Jupiter presented
himself near the meridian, and some one was convinced
he saw a star, which I think must have been Alphuret,
in an intermediate position. Meanwhile our flock of
geese went off homewards, flapping their wings, and
our host's watch-dog ran away in a strangely excited
state. Some one observed a canary, which had been
brought to the hill, resting at the bottom of its cage,
with its head under its wing. Another found the wild
bees beginning to cluster about a spot near us, where
their nest was supposed to be. The cattle, however,
and the horses and pigs, continued to feed, as if nothing
had been the matter. I had no opportunity of observing
any birds; but the lady who attended to the cows saw
some chickens leaping in a singular manner in the farm-
yard, and she heard the cocks crow several times.
Although Gottenburg was only a few miles from the
centre of the shadow, I cannot say that the darkness
nearly amounted to that of a moonless night. I sup-
pose that diffraction theoretically forbids our looking
for perfect darkness--the light from beyond the shadow
pressing in to some degree all round. Nevertheless, by
a natural exaggeration, even scientific observers have
spoken of the totality as a transient night-time. My
report would be, that the darkness is very great, to be
a thing occurring during the day, and words cannot con-
vey a sense of the impression it makes on the beholders;
but it certainly is far from being comparable, in point
of obscurity, to true night. Our seeing only two
planets and one star throughout the whole sky seems
sufficient proof of this.

It was interesting to observe the rapid changes of
the sky during the passage of the shadow. First there
was the gloomy north-west, as the shadow came on;
and at the same time an evening-like glow of amber
light in the opposite quarter. Then the gloom gradually
shifted to the south-cast, and a kind of dawn began in
the quarter which had before shewn so terrible a frown.
If I were not afraid of being, fanciful, I could almost
say I saw the shadow pass in the air over our heads;
nay, could almost say I heard it, for at such a moment

At length the too short three-and-a-half minutes
having passed, a piercing illumination broke out, ap-
parently from a single point, in the eastern limb of the
obscured body, and we felt that all was over. There
was now nothing new to occur, for of course the
ing of the sun was just a reversal of the process of his
obscuration. Our party, therefore, instantly proceeded
to act as if the eclipse were at an end, gathering up
their instruments and other articles, and preparing to
move homewards. Though it was still a kind of dusk,
we felt that the ordinary world was restored to usioj
I am glad to learn to-day that at least one of our
scientific observers has been fortunate enough to
observe those rose-coloured prominences, from the
obscured body of the sun, which have been observed
on several former occasions, but are hitherto matter

gress will now be made towards the clearing up of that

We have had a great deal of amusement: in hearing
of the manner in which this eclipse was regarded
beforehand by the ignorant people of this country.
general sense of alarm was felt, amongst the peasantry
for several weeks, insomuch that in some places agri
cultural operations were suspended, or very imperfectly
performed; A clergyman, of the neighbourhood, the
Dr mom of Sweden, preached that the world was
coming to an end, and that he would undertake to
maintain all who should survive the eclipse. Yesterday
it was found that some things sent out to be washed
could not be got ready, by reason of the terrors under
which the blanchisseuse was suffering. The daughter of
our friend's cook came here in the morning, that she
and her mother might perish together; while another
daughter, unable to get leave from her mistress, bit
terly bewailed her being debarred the same privilege.
Another motion was, that the language of the people
would be changed by the eclipse. Lirather think there
is a kind of ill-will felt towards us English, as if we
had come the other day by the Courier on purpose to
make the eclipse. The clustering of groups in the streets,
and their expressions of astonishment and terror, would,
I am told, have formed a by no means unsuitable study
for the Zoological Section. The low state of Siveden
in point of education, and the natural effects of such
a phenomenon upon the unenlightened mind, are thus
strongly brought before us.al oil „boruda-i vidogo

and are purchased in large quantities, at a very low
rate, for this peculiar description of trade.
Sometimes a brace of speculators in sundries will
sally forth together on what is technically termed the
'pick-up.' Their object is to buy-no matter what-
with a view to a round profit. One of their favourite
plans is to call at every open door, professing to give a
high price for bottles and old clothes. The farther they
get from Bow Bells the more liberal become their offers,
until when fairly out in the country, they boldly offer
three shillings a dozen for bottles which your wine-
merchant sells you for two. But, in fact, bottles they
don't want; and, what is more than that, bottles they
won't have. The following scene, detailed by an eye-
witness, exemplifies their modus operandi :—

The modes of cheating are as various as those of
getting a livelihood. The above is but one sample out
of thousands of the manner in which the simple are

With the exception of some few successful examples
who, like Sam Sundries, have got the world under their
feet, the dealers of this class occupy a position midway
between the keepers of rag-shops, who beneath the
auspices of a black doll suspended aloft over the door-
way, keep open-house for the reception of bones, rags,
and grease, and those connoisseurs in mahogany and
French polish-the furniture-brokers. They carry on a
branch of commerce which the necessities of a nume-

the fire and the axe, and from the very jaws of destruc-
tion, the worn-out and abandoned implements of house-
dwellings of the upper and middle classes, and to refit
and re-establish them for the accommodation of the very
poor. In the exercise of this vocation they are found
to manifest a degree of ingenuity and perseverance
worthy of a better reward than it sometimes obtains,
seeing that the parties with whom they have mostly to
do are even more indigent than themselves. That as a
class they are frequently brought into very intimate
relations with the police force, and find their wander-.
ings confined for a season to the limited area of a prison
cell, does not invalidate the fact, that there are among
them many honest and worthy individuals, to whom
the world is indebted for much painstaking and ill-

a couple of dozen of Black Bottles, and ranks them on the Floor.

Farmer's Wife. Clothes! I got no clothes to sell as
I know of: I haven't a sed nothin' about no clothes.
First Tramp. I daresay you can look up a few, marm.
Can't buy all bottles and no clo'es: must be some o'

some clo'es.
Farmer's Wife. Well, let me see; there be an old
coat I do think my maister ha' done wi': I'll go and

minutes with a coat and pair of pantaloons.] Here be a

Farmer's Wife. Eightpence for theas coat! Whoy,

Farmer's Wife. Well, let me see; that 'll make seven

First Tramp. Here, Ned, clap them togs in the bag.
I may as well pay you for 'em at once, marm. [Pays
her a shilling, while Ned sacks the clothes.]
Farmer's Wife. But the bottles? B'aint ee gwain to

First Tramp. Oh, sartinly, marm. But you see, lor'

BROADSIDES.
THIS is not an article on naval warfare. Our broad-
sides are merely those sheets of paper printed on one
side, that they may be pasted for public perusal on a
wall or some conspicuous place. They are otherwise
called placards, and the French call them affiches, on
account of their being so fixed. The term broadsides
is one of late use in the bibliographical world, where it
has become a passion to collect these documents, their
oddity, absurdity, and triflingness being generally
considered to enhance their value. Nor is such an
appreciation utterly groundless if we consider the
nature of the greater part of these publications, in-
tended to be merely temporary, and to express the
passing excitements and agitations of the moment.
Immediately after they have served their purpose they
are useless; no one has an interest in preserving them,
and they are easily and naturally destroyed. Hence
any that may happen to survive and reappear in a
different age and state of society are welcomed as
curious and expressive memorials of the past, shewing
'the very age and body of the time, his form and pres-
sure. For instance, nothing will tell more emphati-
cally the history of an election than those boasting or
sarcastic announcements to the gaping crowd, which
are so fugitive that they often do not last an hour,
being spitefully destroyed by the other side,' or
covered over by rival proclamations. A series of
election placards of Sir Robert Walpole's day would be
extremely interesting, as doubtless a like collection
relating to our own age would be a century hence.
A history of placards might involve great investiga-

tion and learning, and afford a valuable chapter of the
history of the human race. Before the invention of
printing this form of announcement, by which one
document could be read by many, must have been of
great importance, as the only method, besides vocal
utterance, by which news or statements could be
rapidly made public. But in barbarous times the
importance of the placard would necessarily be limited
by the number of individuals able to read. Scripture
furnishes many solemn instances of this kind of publi-
cation, and the student will remember Virgil's compli-
ment to Augustus, affixed to his palace and claimed by
Bathyllus, whom the poet so effectually exposed, by
affixing some imperfect lines which the false appro-
priator could not complete. At later times in the same
city, an endless succession of placards received the
memorable name of Pasquinades or Pasquils, still used
by literary collectors, and applied to whatever is short,
witty, and severe. It seems to be considered essential
to a pasquil that it should be malicious, and calculated
to serve no good purpose. The origin of the term is
curious. Near the Ursini Palace at Rome was the
booth of a shoemaker, or, as he is sometimes termed, a
tailor, named Pasquino. Centuries must have elapsed
since he existed, as the writers at the commencement
of the seventeenth century speak of his shop as a
matter of tradition: that shop, it was said, had been a
centre of wit and repartee-a place of idle, useless chat,
as the moralists call it. It chanced that after Pas-
quino's death, a colossal but mutilated armed figure
was dug up in the neighbourhood, and erected in a
conspicuous place. It became a practice with the citi-
zens who had written any bitter, personal gibes which
they desired to publish anonymously, to write them
out and paste them on the statue. Thus the fragment
of statuary having become a silent communicator of
the same kind of bitter wit which emanated from the
tradesman's booth, succeeded to his name, and bore that
name of 'Pasquino' so long, that its origin may be
considered doubtful. The satires or lampoons were
generally pasted on the statue during the night, and
here, in the centre of papal authority, appeared some
of the most bitter attacks on the reigning pontiffs: it
was, indeed, the importance attributed to these that
made the term pasquinado so celebrated.*
This leads us by association to another and more
serious kind of placard which came to be levelled
against the same quarter. The old universities of
Europe were not, like our modern colleges, isolated
bodies with separate regulations-they had a free inter-
change, a kind of masonic community, by which a
person holding a position in one of them was admitted
as a brother by all the others, and held his rank, what-
ever it might be, in each seat of learning. As the
counterpart of such a uniformity which perhaps
could not have been carried out but for the general
supremacy of the pope over all educational establish-
ments-the student who claimed university distinctions
had to stand his trial or examination in the face, as it
were, of the whole republic of letters. He thus fixed
a placard on the door of his college, challenging all
comers to dispute certain points with him, which were
set forth in Latin, in distinct portions or theses. The
debate was conducted in the same language, and was
often long and tedious; for in those days scholars spoke
Latin, at least a species of it, as readily as their native
tongue, and they were fully as fond of disputation as
the learned of the present day. The disputant was
entitled to certain hospitalities from the college, and in
particular cases, if he shewed a certain amount of skill,
to a pecuniary reward. It was through these dispu-
tations that the Admirable Crichton made his renowned
sensation in the learned world. He was so perpetually
placarding every church and college, however, with his
* See for a full account of Pasquin, No. 189 of this Journal.
defying challenges, that he almost brought the practice
into ridicule. It is commemorated, that a wit wrote
under one of these boastful announcements And
those who wish to see him may go to the Falcon Inn,
where he will be exhibited alive. This was the form
in which the itinerant exhibitors of wild beasts invited
people to their show, and it created considerable ridi-
cule against Crichton.
In some places the practice of 'impugning,' as it was
termed, lingered so long that Goldsmith profited by it in
his continental wanderings. One body of lawyers in this
country still keeps up the practice, and we have scen
at the entrance-door of the court in which they prac-
tise the theses pasted up, challenging an argument.
This sort of intellectual gladiatorship has, however,
sadly degenerated; for we have been told that practically
the individual who requires to go through the form of
disputation, can get no one to be at the trouble of
acting the part of antagonist unless he be provided
with a counter argument fairly written out. Besides
these ceremonial occasions, the practice of placarding
theses at a university gate was a common one when
any one wished to conduct an argument against all the
learned world on some point of importance. The con-
troversial spirit of the age got out in this form as it
now does in newspapers and pamphlets. The hot-
headed, ill-tempered, perverse disputative men of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries thus began and
carried on their controversies. For instance, a Scots-
man who had been ill used, as he believed, in his own
country, thus made an attack on it, pasting his theses
on the gate of a college at Oxford. His fate was some-
what memorable, as the act was construed into high
treason, and he suffered death. It is far more import-
ant to notice that most of the great debates during
the Reformation were conducted in this form. The
reader of history will at once remember Luther's theses
against the indulgences, pasted up in Wittenberg at
the festival of All Saints.
We wonder if an actual original copy of this docu-
ment be extant? We question it. In miscellaneous
collections of broadsides, however, if they be a century
or two old, one cannot help falling on very curious and
interesting documents. Thus in a bundle before us, we
take out and read one printed in black letter, as it was
the fashion to print public documents in Britain in the
seventeenth century. It is the proclamation by Charles
I., adjourning the parliament of 1628, on account of
the petition of rights, the attacks on his favourite the
Duke of Buckingham, and the remonstrance against
the tax of tonnage and poundage. To those who read
the royal communications to parliament at the present
day, the haughty, imperious tone of the document will
seem startling. The king says:-
'It hath so happened, by the disobedient and sedi-
tious carriage of those said ill-affected persons of the
House of Commons, that we and our royal authority
and commandment have been so highly contemned, as
our kingly office cannot beare, nor any former age can
parallel; and therefore it is our full and absolute
resolution to dissolve the same parliament; wherefore
we' thought good to give notice unto all the lords
spirituall and temporall, and to the knights, citizens,
and burgesses of this present parliament, and to all
others whom it may concerne, that they may depart
about their needful affairs without attending any longer
here. Neverthelesse, we will that they, and all others
should take notice, that we doe, and ever will distin-
guishe between those who have shewed good affection
to religion and government, and those that have given
themselves ever to faction, and to worke disturbance to
the peace and good order of our kingdome.' Along
with this comes a proclamation for suppressing of
false rumours touching parliament,' against ill-disposed
persons who have spread abroad false rumours, as if
the scandalous and seditious proposition in the House

of Commons, made by an utlawed man, desperate în
minde and fortune, which was tumultuously taken up
by some few after that by our royall authority we had
commanded an adjournment, had been the vote of the
whole House, whereas the contrary is the truth.*
The 'utlawed' or outlawed man is an allusion to John
Pym, who afterwards hunted to the scaffold Strafford,
the principal adviser of these arbitrary acts! It suggests
many striking reflections to find in the same collection of
scraps a broadside which appears to have been hawked
through the streets of London, called Verses Written
by Thomas Earle of Strafford a Little before his Death,'
Though Strafford does not appear in Walpole's Royal
and Noble Authors,' these verses, if they be genuine,
might have given him a better title than many who are
included in that work. We shall give the first three
stanzas, which shew that the poem has a good deal of
solemn eloquence:-

At the conclusion of this emphatic denunciation comes
an Advertisement. Such as have not signed this asso-
ciation may do it at St James's (in the room formerly
called the Duke of York's Council-Chamber) every day
between the hours of ten and one in the forenoon and
five and seven in the afternoon." Thus the revolu-
tionists were already in occupation of a chamber where
the Stuart monarch had once presided. In a few days
his heartless daughter was to be running through his
palace, and estimating her new possessions. In the
meantime at narrow slip of paper, the most important
of all, signed Jo. Brown, clerk of parliament, pro-
claims William and Mary, Prince and Princess of
Orange, to be King and Queen of England, France,
and Ireland, with all the dominions and territories'
thereto belonging.' Scotland, it will be observed, is
not mentioned in this document: it was a separate
independent kingdom, transacting its business in its
own way, and its sovereignty could not be settled by
the English parliament; but that body included Ire-
land as a dependency, and France because it was a
mere sovereignty of pretence. The initial letter of this
important document is decorated with two grinning
apes, whose grimaces are at variance with its solemnity.
It would almost seem as if the printer had
put his'
tongue in his cheek while proclaiming the Revolution;
but in reality he probably troubled himself no more
about the placard than if it had related to Smithfield
Market, and took the first type that came to hand.

The placards during the progress of the Revolution
a bundle of which lies before us must have been
intensely exciting. Although there was no actual
civil war, except what afterwards took place in Ireland
and the Highlands, yet the wisest men of the day
believed a conflict inevitable. There never was, per
haps, a period in history when there was more anxiety
and smothered excitement. Hence one cannot touch
these now mute and dusty announcements without
remembering how they were at one time fraught with
the deepest vital interest to the breathless crowds who
read them. While James was still in his palace, and
the Dutch prince with his army had been but faintly
welcomed, a piece of paper, about the size of an ordi-
nary letter, and intended perhaps for circulation among
members of parliament and corporations, contains the
proposals of the Right Honourable the Lords Hallifax,
Nottingham, Godolphin, to the Prince of Orange. This
was a proposal from the king, intended to be popular,
as it offered to call a free parliament.' In another
mere slip of paper, such as porters hand to one in the
street, is the prince's answer, also intended to be popu-
lar, and more successful, because more specific. He
proposes that the two armies shall be kept at an equal
distance from London, and that Tilbury Fort be put
into the hands of the city. The next document is so
dusty, stained, and worn as to be scarcely legible-it is
the declaration of the association for the defence of
the Protestant religion, and for maintaining the ancient
government and the laws and liberties of England,
Scotland, and Ireland.' It is brief but emphatic. It
was, in fact, the announcement that the Whig party
were prepared to support the prince's cause with arms
in their hands, the announcement being contained in
these threatening words! Whereas we are engaged in
this common cause, under the protection of the Prince||
pawnbroker's shop.
The next we turn up is an advertisement of a highly-
inflated character, by an individual named Mack-
Gregory. There is something interesting in the name
itself, as it had evidently (been adopted to avoid the
penalties against using the surname of Macgregor. The
Gregory family had adopted the same termination, dis-
pensing, however, with the Highland patronymic, Mac.'
It has been recorded that the father of Dr John
Gregory was seriously disturbed in his philosophical
retirement by Rob Roy Macgregor claiming relationship
with him. The Mr MacGregory whose placard comes
to hand had, it appears, desired, what is a very com-
mon object at the present day-to get some account of
his wonderful qualifications to serve the public set
forth in a newspaper, as a piece of information which
it was important that the world should possess. What
also frequently occurs where such modest requests
are made, the editor to whom he applied--he of the
Edinburgh Courant 4 would only give his statement a
place as an advertisement. Nay, even in that shape,
he insisted on divesting it of its flowery decorations,'
and, as we shall presently see, this was not wonderful.
Having, he tells us, sent some articles concerning hisi
profession of geography and history and the languages,
and the Couranteer having, out of a mistake, changed
them, placed them among his advertisements, and by
so doing spoiled the sense of them, Mr MackGregory
himself has now ordered an advertisement of his own
to be published, which gives an account of the nature
of his profession,' &c. Mr MackGregory's account of
himself is, that he is a licentiate of both laws, civil and
canon, of the university of Angers. Having, since the
Peace of Ryswick, at several courses travelled over all
Europe, and over a part of Asia and Africa, as far as
the river Euphrates, the Red Sea, and the Nile, and
having had extraordinary occasions of seeing and ob-

serving everything remarkable both by
the Orient as well as in the Occident, what remains of
antiquity as well as what is modern; having lived at
most of the courts of Europe, especially at that of France,
and at those of Italy and Germany, and of late in
Switzerland; having been employed
ed in the public
business, in managing and carrying on the confederate
designs, and in traversing those of the two crowns, by
virtue of a joint commission of resident at Basle for the
ministers of the emperor, the queen of Great Britain,
and the States-General. He intimates that, having
returned home, he intends to put the knowledge
acquired in these important capacities to the humble
duty of teaching. What he undertakes to teach might
be briefly expressed as everything. Mr MackGregory
is not, however, a man of brevity. He is not content
with laying down his qualifications in general heads as
history, geography, art, science, or the like but he fills
the several departments with an enumeration of every-
thing, whether a large subject or the minutest matter,
that his memory recalls to him. Thus in announcing
his capacity to teach geography or topography he pro-
ceeds in this
is manner. Exactly describing countries,
situations, ports, mountains, yallies, hills, plains,
woods, marshes, rivers, brooks, canals, sources, cata-
racts, mouthis, lakes, channels, banks, scas, gulphs,
streights, bays, harbours, shores, the coast of the
Mediterranean, the channel of the Euxine, the roads
of the Red Sea; climates, soils, products, riches,
merchandise, money, forces, armies, fleets, ways of
travelling, courses, roads, distances of places, land and
water carriages, public offices, inns, entertainment
prices, caravans, camels, provisions, catarages; and so
on in an endless jumble. This is about a fourth part
only of the details enumerated under the head of geo-
graphy. One can imagine what an affair it is to go
over all knowledge in such a manner. Mr Mack
Gregory must have had a very illogical mind-such as
that of the man who is mentioned by the old logicians
as dividing his library into books in divinity, fulio,
quarto, medicine, black-letter, Latin, vellum, and
leather. Ilizibai as duals i tabe

two coolies bring loads of wood, consisting of two
maunds (180 pounds' weight), together with ghee and
rosin. Being of a lower caste, they retire to a distance
to rest and look on. All this time the Brahmin has
not been idle: the head of the dying has been sprinkled
with river-water, and the hands and chest rubbed with
mud, and portions of the 'Veda' have been chanted
aloud.
Such is the scene that may be witnessed daily by
any observant person, and was always watched with
interest by the Old Indian. As soon as the sufferer is
certainly dead, the body is washed and dressed accord-
ing to its sex, and if of an affluent person, anointed with
perfumes; the spot selected for the pile is swept clean,
and a shallow drain is dug to allow a flow of moisture
towards the river. The pile is then built, and ghee
and rosin mixed with the wood and straw. The mouth
of the dead body is now touched with money, and some
catables are offered. A clean new cloth is spread over
the pile, and upon this the body is laid, with its head
to the north: if a man, with his face towards the earth;
if a woman, upwards. The cloth is then wound round
it, and the nearest of kin takes a lighted brand, and
with averted face repeats the short prayer already
given; and white the mortal remains are consuming,
such elegiac verses as these are recited from their holy
writ, the Brahmin and followers walking solemnly
round the flames:-
Foolish is he who seeks for permanence in the human
state a state unsolid like the stem of the plantain-tree,
transient like the foam of the ocean.
When a body formed of five elements, in order to
receive the reward of deeds done in life, reverts to its five
original principles, what rooin is there for regret?
The earth is perishable; the ocean, the gods themselves
pass away; and how should that bubble, mortal man,
escape destruction? All that is low must perish; all that
is lofty must fall; all compound bodies must end in dis-
solution; all life must be concluded with death.”
When the body is consumed the ground is washed
and the ashes carefully gathered. The affluent pay the
boatinan well who conveys these remains to the middle
of the river to be thrown into deep water. The obse-
quies of the poorer classes are performed according
to their means. The body is frequently only half-
consumed; or sometimes it is, after the face has been
merely burned with straw, launched into Gunga with
a heavy stone round the waist, to furnish a revolting
but common spectacle to the European when putrefac-
tion comes on and the stone drops.
The funeral ended, all who have attended bathe and
put on a clean dress at the expense of the mourners,
and then return home and undergo a second purifica-
tion at the doors of their houses by holding their hands
to the fire and stepping over it. The mourning lasts
forty days, and is concluded by a shradho and liberal
gifts to the poor. Unlucky is he deemed who has no
descendant to light the pile: a son is preferred, but a
daughter may also perform all the requisite formalities.
The prejudices of the Hindoo prohibit the treasuring
of relics or keepsakes: no such thing is known among
them as the precious lock cut off from the head of a
much-loved child or a revered mother; everything that
belonged to the departed is burned or given to the
Parias and beggars, excepting the jewels or trinkets. In
many instances these are distributed to their favoured
Brahmins, or shared among the relatives, but they
are not given or regarded as souvenirs. Let it not be
supposed, however, that the heart of the Hindoo is
unfeeling. Bitterly does a mother weep over her child,
and with the deepest grief is the husband and parent
consigned to the flames. Men, however, are silent and
dignified in their sorrow: the women-always among
the Hindoos more ignorant-the reverse; they beat
their breasts, tear their hair, and are loud in their
wailing, manifesting their feelings, like children, by
shrieks and tears.
'HOME TRUTHS.
A LATELY published duodecimo, under the title of 'Home
Truths for Home Peace, or "Muddle" Defeated,'*
imparts a number of useful hints on the subject of
domestic life, and rates pretty soundly those young
housewives who, starting on false notions, contrive to
make firesides uncomfortable and everybody about them
miserable. 'Muddle' is the familiar term for disorder
in all its branches, and no kind of Muddle is so offen-
sive as that which prevails in ill-conducted households.
Very incredible things, we are told, take place in the
properly muddled dwelling. Articles of a brittle nature
are found to break in a manner singularly supernatural.
'Cups slip out of the maid's hands; and this, not when she
has let them go, but whilst holding them "as tight as ever
she could hold." Glasses, &c. are constantly falling off
the edges of dressers and of tables, although declared by
competent judges to have been far removed from such a
dangerous position, so that they have evidently moved
back again for the purpose of dashing themselves into a
thousand shivers. Other articles of fragile materials,
but less daring resolution, vary the monotony of their
existence, and assert their right to tender consideration
by "getting" such chips, cracks, and contusions as no
the harder and less sensitive portions of our household
rational person could ever venture to inflict. Nor are
furniture innocent of similar offences: the locks, which,
as fixtures, are secure from injury by falling, will never-
nails" work themselves out"-paint, varnish, &c. “rub
theless "get hampered"-stools "come unglued”—
off" the best-made chairs will dislocate their arms-
the strongest tables break or distort their legs-whilst
other objects, too cowardly for self-inflictions, but
equally perverse in spirit, will choose the very moment
when their presence would be most desirable, to "get
lost;" that is to say, to hide in some out-of-the-way
corner, to which no living soul has ever had access,
and in which consequently no member of the family
would ever think of looking. I appeal to the general
experience and phraseology of my countrywomen, as
to the common occurrence of such household "facts,"
and the implied existence of those latent material
energies which, as comprised in the personification
Nobody, are virtually acknowledged without a
moment's hesitation.'

The young lady who conducts her affairs on the
principle of Muddle has a fair opportunity of displaying
her qualities in the matter of financiering. Her account-
book is usually her memory, and a complicated book it
is! When she has to square up some trifling disburse-
ments with a domestic, the following count and reckon-
ing probably ensues: "Let me see, I gave you 10s. on
Saturday and 9d. the day before. Was it 9d.? No: it
must have been 11d., for I gave you a shilling and you
gave me a penny out for the beggar; then there was
5s. 6d. on Monday, and 8d. you owed me from last
month; and then the 18. 6d. your master gave you for
the parcel-you brought him 2d. back-and 34d. out
of the butcher's bill; no, you had to give 3d. to the
butcher, but you came to me for the d., and I had
no coppers, so we still owe him the d-by the way,
don't forget to pay him the next time you go. Then
there's the baker-no, I paid the baker myself, and I
think the housemaid paid the butterman; but you got
in the cheese the day before, and I have a sort of a
recollection that I may possibly owe you for that, all
but a few pence you must have had left of mine, that I
told you to take from off the chimneypiece. Well,
cook, I think that's nearly all! now, how do your

accounts stand ?" This the poor cook, who is a cook
and not a conjurer, finds it no easy matter to discover.'
Time and patience will overcome all difficulties.
Quite true, as a proposition; but we need to add the
qualification — always provided that one makes a
reasonable effort to remove the said difficulties;' for it
is undeniable that petty annoyances do not vanish of
- their own accord. Our author moralises on that won-
derful amount of patience which leads some people to
put up with daily annoyances which the outlay of a
few shillings, or the exertion of a few minutes, would
effectually remove. 'Narrow means, an inconvenient
house, a disagreeable situation, tiresome children, stupid
servants; or, worse than even these, toothache and
an ill-tempered husband-these are trials for which
patience is the best and almost only remedy; and all
who have patience enough under such circumstances
are entitled to our sympathy and admiration. But, in
addition to the unavoidable afflictions of their lot, how
many go on, from day to day and year to year, with
doors that never shut, windows and drawers that
nobody can open, keys that will not lock, grates that
never draw, blinds that won't keep up, and curtains
that won't come down-nails that tear their things, and
things that tear their nails; and whilst professing to
be above noticing such petty grievances, how many
expend so much of their stock of patience upon these
unnecessary evils, that they have scarcely any left for
inevitable annoyances! Could such persons calculate,
at the year's end, the amount of time and strength
expended in daily struggles with only one drawer "that
always sticks, so that there is the greatest difficulty in
pulling it out; and when out, it is all that anybody
can ever do to push it in again;" and if they could
recollect and believe the singular verbal manifestations
of their indifference to "these trifles that no one should
make a moment's fuss about, in a world where there
is so much real trouble," it is probable they would
be quite as much surprised as those who have long
wondered at the perversity which has cherished such
needless causes of "botheration" to themselves and
others. To ladies who do not perceive any harm in
adding to the comforts and diminishing the inconve-
niences of our mortal life, I recommend the condensed
philosophy of the following well-known but little heeded

It does not escape this shrewd observer, that an
excessive punctiliousness in keeping a house neat and
orderly may give as much annoyance to visitors as the
discomfort of untidiness. It is our own impression that
some English housewives go beyond all proper bounds
in this respect. Tying up every article of furniture
in pinafores, they appear to consider that 'drawing-
rooms' are toys to be looked at, not to be used. Of this
species of vulgarity there are some graphic definitions.
"The only easy-looking chair is introduced to you as
one that nobody should sit upon;" another is recom-
mended to your attention, as one you are on no
account to lean against." You are civilly requested
"not to draw certain curtains," and rather uncivilly
reminded "you should have let down certain blinds."
A case is made for the cover of the embroidered otto-
man, lest the dye of your garments should come off
upon it; and, whilst the marks of other people's careless-
ness are exhibited for your instruction and construction,
you contemplate the face of the polished mahogany of
your appointed washstand in helpless embarrassment,
how ever you shall wash your own. In a word, you
are expected, like every other inmate of the dwelling,
to exist solely in reference to the excessive order and
cleanliness around you; and every energy of your mind,
at every moment of the day, must be exerted over every
energy and movement of your body, to avoid your doing
mischief or giving offence continually.
'I appeal to all who have experience in the state of
things alluded to, whether the feeling of disorder and
confusion was not produced in them by the very
precautions used for their perpetual banishment! A
confusion worse than any mere material confusion can
be-a confusion of ideas and principles, of fears and
fidgets, of pleasures and of pains, of luxuries and lum-
ber; an undistinguishable mixture of venial oversights
and unpardonable transgressions, low seats and high
treason, large rooms and little minds, sweet portraits
and sour faces, whole china and cracked tempers;
besides the ever-recurring puzzle, as to whether people
were living in a house or for a house; or whether the
things, about which such a coil is made, do really be-
long to their soi-disant possessors, or the individuals
who claim for them such attention and respect, are
merely belongings of their things..... And, after all,
what is the end obtained by this perpetual care and
sorrow? The depriving everything about us of its
lawful use, and consequently of its real value; the
establishment and practice of an idolatry that the
veriest heathen might be ashamed of. . . . . Of all
the Muddles that bring misery and ruin in their train,
defend me from the love-destroying and comfort-killing
Muddle of inexorable cleanliness and order!'
The detestable meanness of living beyond honestly-
earned and available resources is very properly included
among the common errors of domestic life; and of this
species of dishonesty there is the more reason to speak
plainly, as it is too frequently practised by individuals
who assume airs of superiority, and are the veriest
bigots in matters of religious concern. We shall, there-
fore, conclude our notice of this clever little volume
with a quotation on the subject of wantonly-incurred
debt.
'What comparison is there, in fact, between the
guilt of the poor uneducated wretch who ventures, in
rags and misery, to steal from the apparent super-
fluities of his neighbour a portion for his starving
family, and the crime of the well-fed, well-dressed,
much-accomplished lady, who sails into the shop of the
unwary tradesman for articles of useless luxury, and
under cover of the respectability of her appearance and
the address she gives, "defrauds him of property to a
considerable amount ?". The ragged culprit is watched
and driven from the window-the fashionable thief is
welcomed in complacently and bowed out gratefully,
with the promise that "her esteemed orders shall be
attended to immediately." When the goods she has
nominally purchased are sent home, and they, like
their real owner, are readily taken in, the grand piano
is perhaps heard in her elegantly-furnished villa, or the
carriage of some wealthier friend is standing at the
door. The lady's place in church and in society is
gaily filled, and for a certain, or rather an uncertain
period, the custom and company of "such a highly
respectable family" are considered an acquisition in
the neighbourhood. But a change comes over the
spirit of the dream: in course of time the lady who
ordered with the greatest ease, is discovered to pay
with the greatest difficulty, and her commands are not
so much esteemed as formerly. The dishonest beggar,
if detected, is committed to prison; but when things
come to a crash with the fashionable thief, the lady's
husband is simply declared "unfortunate;" and if
forced to remove into a humbler dwelling, in a district
in which she is not known, the lady is at liberty to
pursue her former practices of shop-lifting as far as
circumstances will allow ! Alas for the rottenness of
the state in which such things are not only possible
but common! What a false, what a fatal standard of
respectability is that which allows individuals who
have lost their credit with the poorest shopkeeper, to

mix with unblushing confidence in what each quarter
terms its "best society!" This carelessness in regard
to debt is one of the most deadly evils in the world,
and, like all such, it has its rise from small beginnings
of practical error, and from a great and important
deficiency in the fundamental principles of moral con-
duct..... The whole court-calendar does not contain
a title conferring so much real dignity, and so many
substantial privileges, as that of "A PERSON TO BE
TRUSTED.'

FIBROUS SUBSTANCES APPLICABLE TO MANUFACTUres.
•
We have seen a specimen of the fibrous substance of a
plant growing wild in our Indian possessions, and which
may be had in any quantity. It has not been in this
country before. The fibre is long, soft, tough, and silky.
We have also received a specimen of the fibres of an-
other East Indian production, of a finer description,
which might probably be converted into a new and useful
material for wefting fancy stuffs of a mixed kind, such
as those made at Bradford. We understand that one or
two bales of the latter production have reached this coun-
try, and are for sale. In the Great Exhibition there are
several fibrous substances well worthy the inspection of
manufacturers. Amongst the contributions from Ceylon,
west from the transept, will be found a number of these,
all more or less adapted for being spun into yarn. In
the contributions from Spain will be found a beautifully-
fine embroidered dress made from the fibre of the pine-
apple, with the inscription: This dress is made entirely
from yarn spun from the fibre of the pine-apple, and
embroidered by hand, by Signora Margrita of Manilla.'
The texture of the cloth is wonderfully fine and even,
and of a beautiful white. In the China department are
several specimens of long China flax or grass, with the
thread spun from the same, of great evenness, and very
fine; along with several pieces of cloth, bleached and
unbleached, as fine as cambric. In the section Spain
will also be found samples of Spanish flax and hemp,
not well enough dressed for spinning purposes, but still
serviceable for paper-making. In this department, too,
is a most interesting specimen of the inner skin (of great
size and texture) of a tree from the island of Cuba. It
is called lace-rind,' and consists of the finest fibrous
filaments arranged like network. The article alluded to
will be found numbered 284 in the Spanish section, and
is exhibited by M. de Ysasi. The Botanical Museum at
the Kew Gardens, to which the admittance is free, con-
tains some beautiful and curious specimens of fibrous
substances from a number of plants imported from
various foreign countries. Among these will be found
the fibre of the bromelia, used in the Isthmus of Panama
by the shoemakers for making shoe-thread; fibre used
for making nets in New Granada; Crotalariu juncia, a
vegetable fibre, imported from Bombay and Ceylon, with
specimens of very fine fishing tackle made from it,
almost as lustrous and transparent as glass, as well as
many other specimens of vegetable fibres well worthy of
careful examination. These are all to be seen in the
upper gallery of the museum. To printers, designers,
shawl-weavers, and others, the beautiful collection of
prints, and copies of rare and curious exotic plants and
flowers contained in the same museum, will afford an
almost inexhaustible source of study, tending to improve
their taste and advance them in their profession.-

THE ACTINIA.
It is a powerful, fearless, and voracious creature,
readily grasping small fishes, fierce crustacea, worms,
leeches, and soft testacea; and endeavouring to gorge
itself with thrice the quantity of food its most capacious
stomach is capable of receiving. Two or three days after
a mussel has been swallowed entire, the shell has been
rejected quite empty. It is endowed with a very slow
locomotive faculty, rarely exercised. At Blackness Castle,
as well as here at Newhall's Point, the Actinia cerasum,
or cherry actinia, occurs affixed to stones of moderate
sizes. It is of a fine red colour, sometimes the richest
vermilion, the tubercles like so many beautiful pearls
of the purest white; and when expanded (in the water
of course), it resembles a brilliant flower unfolded to
enjoy the sunshine. When contracted, it is like a
fine ripe cherry. One specimen, taken in 1805, sur-
duced a monstrosity, like the Siamese twins-two bodies
vived six years, and produced young.
Another pro-
of pale-green, united by the middle, the general progeny
being red; and this youngster continued producing
afterwards, litter after litter, of sixty, forty-three, &c.,
green ones the actinia being hermaphrodite. When
about six years old the vessel had been too much re-
plenished, one of the bodies rose over the edge, the con-
adhered again to the base; one was accidentally lost, but
necting flesh was twisted and rent asunder. Both bodies
the other continued to survive and to breed pale-green,
although it diminished in size after the separation.-

A RHYME ABOUT BIRDS.
I SAID to the little Swallow:
'Who 'll follow ?
Out of thy nest in the eaves
Under the ivy leaves!
Yet my thought flies swifter than thou:
My thought has a softer nest,
Where it folds its wing to rest,
In a pure-hearted woman's breast;
While its sky is her cloudless brow.'
Swallow-swallow,
Who'll follow ?
I said to the brown, brown Thrush:
"Hush-hush!
Through the wood's full strains I hear
Thy monotone deep and clear,
Like a sound amid sounds most fine;
And so, though the whole world sung
To my love with eloquent tongue,
However their voices rung,
She would pause and listen to mine.'
Brown, brown thrush,
Hush-hush!
I said to the Nightingale:
'Hail, all hail!
Pierce with thy trill the dark,
Like a glittering music-spark,
When the earth grows pale and dumb;
But mine be a song more rare,
To startle the sleeping air,
And to the dull world declare
Love sings amid darkest gloom.'
Nightingale,
Hail, all hail!
I said to the sky-poised Lark:
Hark-hark!
Thy note is more loud and free,
Because there lies safe for thee
A little nest on the ground.
And I, when strong-winged I rise
To chant out sweet melodies,
Shall know there are home-lit eyes
Watching me soar, sun-crowned.'

A PLEA FOR THE BEAUTIFUL.
THE conception of the Great Exhibition has been
realised in its material part. We see there side by
side, in one prodigious glass-case, the productions of
the whole world in aft and industry; and we are able
to estimate the strivings and attainments of each nation
in the race of progress and improvement. But our
criterion as yet is only partial. It relates to the strife,
not to the thing striven after. We see what has been
accomplished by one people comparatively with another;
but we apply no general law to determine the condition
of taste in the epoch to which the extraordinary show
belongs. We have abundance of sketches, descriptions,
and comparisons; but the philosophy of the Exhibition
iş unwritten. The material spectacle is before us, but
we have not yet begun to extract the moral. Hurried,
dazzled, astonished, delighted, we have not had leisure
to discover that the wonderful collection is informed by a
soul, and that the vast Palace which contains it is haunted
by voices of prophecy and denunciation, inaudible to
common ears, but as full of significance to those who will
listen intently as the delicate strings of Aspendius.
When thinkers take the place of mere spectators, the
revelations of the Crystal Palace touching the genius,
history, and destiny of nations, will be curious and
important; but in the meantime we shall mention
only one subject among those that are likely to excite
inquiry and interest: this is the point of taste at
which the refined part of mankind have arrived as
regards the Beautiful.
We have repeatedly avowed ourselves to be of those
who believe that there is a principle in nature which
governs beauty in form, just as there is known to be
one which governs beauty in sound; that the taste may
be educated up to the appreciation of the most perfect
kind of beauty; and that the progress made by a people
in this education exercises a powerful influence upon
the national character. But setting such speculations
aside for the present, as being fitting matter for con-
troversy, it cannot be denied that there was a certain
period of Grecian art in which objects of taste were
produced-from a graven gem to a statuary, group,
from a drinking-cup to a temple--that have been con-
sidered by the whole civilised world, in all succeeding
ages, as types of beauty, perfect and unassailable. On
these masterpieces have been founded universal canons
of criticism which, after intervening centuries of dark-
ness and confusion, were implicitly acknowledged by
the awakened mind of Europe; and to this day the
rule remains absolute, in so far as theory is concerned,
all other types being looked upon as fanciful and
extravagant.
PRICE 1d.
The interval of darkness may be said to have com-
menced at the fall of the Eastern empire; for Greece
was plundered of her treasures only when these had lost
their value in the eyes of the degenerate people. The
number of statues carried into captivity almost equalled
the number of men slain in battle, and the palaces of the
Roman nobility became museums of Grecian art. But
all to no purpose; for the sentence had gone forth like-
wise against the empire of the West and the masters of
the world. Roman art, in its best ages, was only a
cold and lifeless imitation; and when Rome fell, such
was the desolation,' says the biographer of Lorenzo de
Medici, which took place in Italy during the middle
ages, occasioned not only by natural calamities, but
by the yet more destructive operation of moral causes,
the rage of superstition, and the ferocity of barbarian
conquerors, that of the innumerable specimens of art
which till the time of the later emperors had decorated
the palaces and villas of the Roman nobility, scarcely
a specimen or vestige was in the beginning of the
fifteenth century to be discovered,'
The fulness of time, however, came at last. The
cycle had gone round; and in the course of ages the
energies of the savage tribes mingling with the worn-
out refinement of the Romans, had produced a new
European character. Then art and literature arose
simultaneously; and Giotto, the first considerable
Italian painter, was the contemporary of Dante, Boc-
caccio, and Petrarch. Then the treasures of the classical
ages were disinterred; and marble heads, busts, torsos,
limbs, came forth from holes and corners like the dead
in the early pictures of the resurrection. The Floren-
tine Museum of the Medici family was the precursor of
the collections of a similar kind which at a later period
began to enrich most of the countries of Europe; and
at the present day Greek temples are imitated in
countries unknown to the Greeks, and the forms of
classical art, in statues, vases, gems, and other objects
of taste, are familiar and abundant.
Under such circumstances, we should expect to find
the Glass Palace overflowing with the beauty of the age
of Pericles; but this is so far from being the case, that
the classical style is in very small proportion. It is in
fact incontestable, from the crowded evidence of the
place, that the taste of Europe has degenerated, and
that we have gone back to seek our forms and embel-
lishments in the dark ages, before the indignant voice
of Petrarch was heard calling the Italians from their
Gothic slumber! This is apparent in numberless
objects of the collection, and frequently even in the
ornamentation with which classical models themselves
are bedizened. The commonest implements, as well as
the highest objects of art, are subjected to the same

barbarian process: an inkstand or a candlestick is
twisted and tormented till we can hardly guess the
nature of the article; and everywhere we are met by
marvels of ingenuity, of mechanical skill, and of vul-
garity of taste. The classical form may be sometimes
preserved, but it is preserved like a mummy, hidden in
its multifarious coverings; or it is wrought upon by a
mediæval imagination, like the oxide rising in points
and jags upon polished steel. Under this process,
fitness of parts, harmony of ideas, unity of purpose, or
-to express all these in a single word-that divine
eurythmia, which awakens in the mind the perception
and the joy of beauty, is lost.
•
In the last number of the 'Edinburgh Review' there
is an anecdote of a labourer turning up, while digging
in a field, an old pickle-jar.' He thought it was a
money-pot; but finding nothing in it but a few burnt
bones, he kicked it to pieces. This pickle-jar was dis-
covered by the fragments to have been an elegantly-
formed Roman sepulchral urn.' Now, if instead of
having only elegance to recommend it, the vase had
been put out of shape by all sorts of queer incrusta-
tions of grinning faces and so on, it would have been
safe enough. The modern Goth would have had a
picture-incongruous and meaningless, it is true, but
still a picture-to please his rude imagination, and he
would have played the collector instead of the icono-
clast. This is not the story of an individual but of a
generation: the discriminating taste of the field-digger
is displayed in a thousand different ways in the Great
Exhibition; where a redundancy of useless or ridi-
culous ornament is called richness, and the inability to
appreciate simple and beautiful, or grand and noble
forms, receives the name of genius.
Extravagance in ornament was a healthy sign in the
middle ages ·
-a sign of a restless and vigorous spirit
giving way to its unenlightened impulses with an
ardour which promised great things for a new era of
progress. It displayed itself alike in architecture, in
dress, in armour, in tournaments, in crusades, and in
religion; and that pomp of love, by which the time
made woman an idol, foreshadowed an epoch when,
advancing with the march of ages, she would become a
spirit to enlighten and refine. But we are the fulfil-
ment of what was then prophesied. We are the middle
ages elevated and matured, and what was strength in
them is weakness in us. Look at that modern pile
which, except in the want of rich windows and exqui-
sitely-elaborate doorways, out-Gothics Gothic! It bears
on its roof a world of little turrets and little spires,
and little domes and little cupolas, and reminds one of
a board of toys and images carried on the vendor's head.
This forest of masonry is the most obtrusive part of
the building, and costs a great deal more than all the
rest put together: but it is useless-it does not even
affect the purposes (whether of warlike defence or
outlook) of its mediaval prototype; and its existence
therefore is either a proof of low taste, or a wilful
waste of skill, capital, and energy.
This misconception of the ornamental extends even
to those buildings meant to be classical. We have
heard one prodigiously admired on account of its really
admirable columns, which raise their gigantic heads a
great part of the height of the façade, where they serve
to support-little statues! They are connected with
the building only by being tacked to it by some abut-
ment in the middle, so that if anything should occur to
sweep them away, the walls would not lose a single
stone. Considered as what they actually are in this
instance, mere ornaments, the columns are as much
out of place as statues the size of life would be adorn-
ing a mantelpiece; but the columns of really classical
buildings are ornamental only in their proportions and
ornaments: in themselves they support the roof or
some other essential part of the edifice. In the earliest
Greek temples there were no walls, and the roof rested
on a quadrangular colonnade.
The tendency of the present day to go back to types
long ago discarded is obvious in other things besides
those that appertain to ornamental art. The word
type suggests an instance of itself. Books intended to
be more than commonly elegant are frequently printed
not only in the form of those of an earlier time, but
with the very letter which the improvements in type-
founding had rendered obsolete. Many a printer
thanks his stars for the new taste, of the day, and
rummages his warehouses for founts of antediluvian
type which he had only hoped to use as old metal for
refounding. And a strange appearance does this letter-
press make, with paper so rich and yet so delicate,
and illustrated by engravings, each of which, at the
time the type was new, would have cost more than the
price of the whole volume. The same remark may be
made of binding; and not merely as regards the old
tooling, as it is called, but the substance of the boards
themselves—which are sometimes literally boards of
thick wood.
Let it not be supposed that we object to the occa-
sional reproduction of worn-out forms as matters of
curiosity and contrast. What we deprecate is the
general tendency to retrogression in productions of
taste. We cannot with impunity fall away from
beauty, to offer up our ingenuity and skill on the altars
of the strange gods of our ignorant ancestors. Virtue,
order, happiness, depend in a great measure upon taste.
The hills, the glens, the woods, the waters, the birds,
the flowers - all things that God has clothed with
beauty-possess a medicative power to heal the soul
and invigorate the affections. This beauty-for beauty
is universal-is the true aim of art, and not of high
art alone, but of everything that appeals to the taste.
The enjoyment of the works of nature will be of little
use if their impression is to be instantly effaced by the
artificial objects that surround us; and each one of
these objects, therefore-even the most minute and
insignificant-ought to be constructed on the very same
principle of harmony which plans a temple or glorifies
the heavens.
Without taking this large view of the subject, it
would be impossible to comprehend why the taste of
one age should be better than that of another-why
such a form or such an ornament, which does not affect
the question of utility, should be an improvement upon
another form or another ornament; why a Grecian urn
should be more beautiful than a pickle-jar. There
must be a reason for this; there must be a law by
which our perceptions of beauty are governed; and
although we may differ as to the nature of that law, it
is impossible to be blind to its results upon the taste.
Taste advances with moral progress-nay, it is essen-
tially a part of moral progress. The voice of Petrarch
did not resound through the world of intellect alone;
for with the beautiful things of antiquity that answered
to the call, there came welling up from the long-sealed

fountains of the heart great thoughts, noble aspirations,
and graceful sentiments. The gloom of the dark ages
fled before the light of art and letters, and the world
entered upon a new cycle of existence.
It would be easy for us to cite hundreds of individual
objects in the Exhibition as a justification of these
remarks, and equally easy to cite others that form the
exception. But we have no such invidious purpose.
We are satisfied with drawing attention to a general
tendency to retrogression in taste which can only serve
to interrupt and retard the progress of the age. L. R.
THE STOLEN ROSE.
GERALDINE DELISLE was the year previous to the
late Revolution, which in one day shattered one of the
great monarchies of the earth, the reigning belle in
her circle. Lovely in form and face, she wanted but
to correct some trifling defects of character to be
perfect. But if she had large black eyes and massive
brow, and beautiful hair and white teeth-if she had
a lily-white hand and tiny feet, she knew it too well,
and knew the power of her charms over man. She
loved admiration, and never was so happy as when in
a ball-room: all the men were almost disputing for the
honour of her hand. But Geraldine had no declared
suitor: she never gave the slightest encouragement to
any one. Many offered themselves, but they were
invariably rejected, until at twenty her parents began
to be alarmed at the prospect of her never marrying.
M. and Mme Delisle had found so much genuine
happiness in marriage - the only natural state for
adult human beings. - that they had promoted the
early marriage of two sons and an elder daughter; and
now that Geraldine alone remained, they earnestly
desired to see her well and happily married before they
died. They received numerous offers; but the young
girl had such winning ways with her parents, that
when she declared that she did not like the proposer,
they never had courage to insist.
During the season of 1847 Geraldine never missed
a party or ball. She never tired as long as there was
music to listen to, and it was generally very nearly
morning before she gained her home. About the
middle of the season she was sitting by her mother's
side in the splendid salons of the Princess Menzikoff.
She had been dancing, and her late partner was saying
a few words, to which she scarcely made any reply.
Her eyes were fixed upon a gentleman, who, after
observing her for some time, had turned away in search
of some one. He was the handsomest man she had
ever seen in her life, and she was curious to know
who he was. A little above the middle height, slight,
pale, with great eyes, soft in repose like those of a
woman, he had at once interested Geraldine, who, like
most women, could excuse every bad feature in a man
save insipid or unmeaning eyes; and she asked her
mother who he was.
'He's a very bad man,' said Mme Delisle. Of noble
family, rich, titled, young, and handsome, he is cele-
brated only for his follies. He throws away thousands
on very questionable pleasures, and has the unpardon-
able fault, in my eyes, of always ridiculing marriage.'
'I cannot forgive him for ridiculing marriage,
mamma, but I can excuse him for not wishing to
marry.'
'My dear, a man who dislikes marriage is never a
good man. A woman may from caprice or from many
motives object to marrying, but a man, except when
under the influence of hopeless affection and men
have rarely feeling enough for this-always must be a
husband to be a good citizen.'
Ah, mamma, you have been so happy that you
think all must be so; but you see many who are not.'
'Mme Delisle,' said the Princess Menzikoff, who un-
perceived had come round to her, 'allow me to intro-
duce you to my friend Alfred de Rougement. I must
not call him count, he being what we call a democrat
with a clean face and white kid-gloves.'
6
The princess is always satirical,' replied M. de
Rougement smiling; and my harmless opposition to
the government now in power, and which she honours
with her patronage, is all her ground for so terrible
an announcement.'
Mme Delisle and Geraldine both started and coloured,
and when Alfred de Rougement proposed for the next
dance, was accepted, though next minute the mother
would gladly have found any excuse to have prevented
her daughter from dancing. Alfred de Rougement was
the very bad man' whom she had the instant before
been denouncing. But it was now too late. From
that evening Geraldine never went to a ball without
meeting Alfred. She received many invitations from
most unexpected quarters, but as surely as she went
she found her new admirer, who invited her to dance
as often as he could without breaking.the rules of
etiquette. And yet he rarely spoke: the dance once
over, he brought her back to her mother's side, and left
her without saying a word, coming back when his turn
came again with clockwork regularity. In their drives
Mine Delisle and Geraldine were always sure to meet
him. Scarcely was the carriage rolling up the Champs
Elysées before he was on horseback within sight. He
merely bowed as he passed, however, keeping con-
stantly in sight without endeavouring to join them.
One evening, though invited to an early soirée and
to a late ball, during dinner they changed their mind,
and decided on going to the Opera at the very open.
ing, to hear some favourite music which Geraldine
very much admired. They had not yet risen from
dessert when a note came from Alfred de Rougement,
offering them his box, one of the best in the house!
"Why he is a regular Monte Christo,' cried Mme
Delisle impatiently. How can he know our move-
ments so well?'
'He must have bribed some one of the servants,'
replied Geraldine: 'we talked just now of where we
were going before they left the room.'
'But what does he mean?' said Mme Delisle. 'Is he
going to give up his enmity to marriage, and propose
for you?'
"
'I don't know, mamma,' exclaimed the daughter,
colouring very much; but he may spare himself the
trouble.'
'Geraldine-Geraldine! you will always then make
me unhappy!' said her mother, shaking her head.
'But you cannot want me to marry Alfred?
told me everything against him yourself.'
You
But if he is going to marry and be steady, I owe
him an apology. But go and dress: you want to hear
the overture.'
They went to Alfred's box-father, mother, and
daughter. But though in the house, he scarcely came
near them. He came in to inquire after their health,
claimed Geraldine's hand for the opening quadrille at
the soirée to which they were going after the opera,
and went away. The young girl rather haughtily
accepted his offer, and then turned round to attend to
the music and singing.
Next day, to the astonishment of both M. and Mme
Delisle, Alfred de Rougement proposed for the hand of
their daughter, expressing the warmest admiration for
her, and declaring with earnestness that the happiness
of his whole life depended on her decision. Geraldine
was referred to. She at once refused him, giving no
reason, but expressing regret that she could not share
his sentiments. The young man cast one look of
reproach at her, rose, and went away without a word.
When he was gone she explained to her parents, that
though in time she thought she should have liked him,
she did not admire his mode of paying his addresses:
she thought he ought to have spoken to her first.

Mme Delisle replied, that she now very much admired
him, and liked his straightforward manner; but Geral-
dine stopped the conversation by reminding her that he
was rejected, and that all discussion was now useless.
That evening Geraldine danced several times with
her cousin Edouard Delisle, a young man who for a
whole year had paid his addresses to her. They were
at a house in the Faubourg St Germain, where the ball-
room opened into a splendid conservatory. Geraldine
was dressed in white, with one beautiful rose in her
hair, its only ornament. Edouard had been dancing
with her, and now sat down by her side. They had
never been so completely alone. They occupied a
corner near the end, with a dense mass of trees behind
them and a tapestry door. Edouard once again spoke
of his love and passion, vowed that if she would not
consent to be his he should never be happy: all this in
a line which shewed how fully be expected to be again
refused.
If you can get mamma's consent, Edouard,' she
replied quickly, I am not unwilling to be your
wife.'
Edouard rose from his seat and stood before her
the picture of astonishment. Geraldine rose at the
same time.
'But where is your rose?' said the young man, still
scarcely able to speak with surprise.
'It is gone-cut away with a knife!' replied she
thoughtfully; but never mind: let us look for
mamma.'
เ
Edouard took her arm, and in a few minutes the
whole family were united. The young man drew his
uncle away from a card-table, saying that Geraldine
wished to go home. After handing his aunt and cousin
to their carriage, he got in after them, quite an unusual
thing for him...
Why, Edouard, you are going out of your way,'
said the father. 1.
I know it. But I cannot wait until tomorrow.
M. Delisle, will you give me your daughter's hand?
Geraldine has given her consent."
'My dear girl,' exclaimed her mother, 'why did you
not tell us this before? You would have saved us so
much pain, and your other suitors the humiliation of
being rejected.'
'I did not make up my mind until this evening,'
replied Geraldine. 'I do not think I should have
accepted him to-morrow, But he was cunning enough
to come and propose before I had time for reflection,'
You will then authorise me to accept him?' said
M. Delisle.
I have accepted him, papa,' replied Geraldine.
That evening Edouard entered the house with them,
and sat talking for some time. When he went away, he
had succeeded in having the wedding fixed for that day-
month. Geraldine looked pale the next day; and when
her mamma noticed it, said that she should go to no
more parties, as she wished to look well the day she
was married, and expressed a wish to go on excursions
into the country instead. Mme Delisle freely acquiesced.
Edouard came to dinner, looking much pleased, but still
under the influence of the astonishment which had not
yet been effaced from his plump and rosy face.
!
Why, what do you think?' he said towards the
end of the dinner- Alfred de Rougement has left
Paris. All his servants were dismissed this morning,
and his steward received orders to meet him at
Constantinople.'
"
'Indeed?' replied Mme Delisle gravely, while Geraldine
turned deadly pale. But this room is too close for
you, my child.'
'No, mamma,' said she quietly; but we are forgetting
all about our excursions. I should like to go to Ver-
sailles to-morrow, and take all the pretty places round
Paris in turn.'
'Bon!' cried Edouard; 'that suits me. I shall be

'I want to breakfast at Versailles,' replied Geraldine;

That I vote to be an admirable proposition. At

new variations on Pastoris, are you not ?' ‚¸¡
'Yes; and you are going to sing, monsieur,' said
Geraldine rising from table,So come along, and ma
and papa can play trietrae all the time.'
་་་ ་
That evening the cousins played and sang together
until about ten, when they took ten, which Edouard,
good-natured fellow, pretended to like prodigiously,
drinking three cups of milk and water under the
serious impression that it was the genuine infusion-a
practice very common in France, where ten is looked
on as dangerous to the nerves. Next day they went to
Versailles, breakfasted at the Hôtel de France, visited
the interminable galleries of pictures, and dined in
Paris at a late hour. The day after they went to
Montmorency,
Swiftly passed the hours, and days, and weeks, and
soon Geraldine saw the last day which was to be her
own. In twenty-four hours she was to leave her
mother's home for ever, to share that of a man to whom
it must be supposed she was very much attached,
but who was not exactly the companion suited to her.
Geraldine was very grave that morning. It had been
arranged that they were to go to St Germain; and
though the sky was a little dark, the young girl
insisted on the excursion not being put off,
This is the last day I shall have any will of my
own,' said she; so let me exercise it.'

'My dear Geraldine,' replied her cousin kindly, you
will always find me ready to yield to you in everything.
I shall be a model husband, for I am too lazy to oppose
any one..

My dear Edouard, put in Mme Delisle, a man
who consults his wife's happiness will always be happy
himself. We are very easily pleased when we see
you try to please us. The will is everything to us.'
Then let us start,' said Edouard laughing: it will
pass the time, and I am eager to try.
They entered the open carriage which they usually
used for their excursions, and started, the sun,now
shining very brightly, Edouard was full of spirits:
he seemed bursting with happiness, and was forced to
speak incessantly to give it vent. Geraldine was very
grave, though she smiled at her cousin's sallies, and
every now and then answered in her own playful, witty
way. The parents, though happy, were serious too.
They were about to lose their last child, and though
they knew she would be always near them, a feeling of
involuntary loneliness came over them. A marriage-
day is always for affectionate parents a day of sorrow-
ful pleasure-a link in the chain of sacrifices which
makes a parent's love so beautiful and holy, so like
what we can faintly trace in thought as the love of the
Creator for man.
They took the road by Bongiral, and they were
about a mile distant from that place when suddenly
they found themselves caught in a heavy shower. The
coachman drove hastily for shelter into the midst of a
grove of trees, which led up to a villa that appeared
totally uninhabited. But it was not so; for the porte
cochère flew wide open as they drew up, and two servants
advancing, requested them to take shelter in the house.
'But we are intruding?' said Mme Delisle.
'No, madame. Our master is out, but had he been
at home he would insist as we do.'
d
Edouard leaped out, and set the example of com-
pliance. The whole party followed the servants, who
led the way into a splendidly-furnished suite of rooms.
The style was that of the renaissance, of the richest
materials, while the walls were covered with genuine
paintings by the first masters. The servants then left

Upon my word we are very fortunate,' said Mme
Delisle in ten minutes we should have been soaked

The whole party looked unfeignedly surprised; but

With these words he gave Geraldine his arm, and
led the way, setting the example also of attacking the
délicate viands offered to them so unexpectedly. All
breakfasted with appetite after their ride, and then
returned to the room they had first occupied. The
shower was over, and the warm sun was quickly
clearing away all sign of the rain. 165 2

The instant all were gone Geraldine rose from her
chair and tottered across the room. She was pale,
and looked cautiously round, as if about to do some
guilty act. Presently she stood before a curtain which
had been hastily drawn before a kind of niche in the
wall, or rather before a portion of the room. But it
had been done very quickly, and through two apertures
you could see stained glass, and on a small table some-
tling under a glass-case. Geraldine could not restrain
herself. She pulled away the curtain, and there, under
a large glass on a velvet cushion, lay the rose which
had been cut from her head-dress on the night she had
accepted the hand of her cousin. Near it was a pencil-
sketch of herself. 25 11 &

'My God!' cried Edouard, returning alone to fetch
Geraldine, to whom he wanted to shew the garden-

him, and taking both his hands, come here; you will
forgive Geraldine, won't you? I have been very
wicked. Do excuse your cousin, will you not? but I
was only going to marry you because I thought Alfred
did not love me.'
'Hein!' cried Edouard quite bewildered.
Don't be angry with me,' continued Geraldine
gravely: 'I should have been a very good wife, and
have loved you very much had I married you.'
Oh, then, you do not mean to marry me now?' said
Edouard in a tone of deep sadness.
"What am I to do?' cried Geraldine. See, my dear
cousin, how he loved me! How can I marry you when

'You do forgive me!' exclaimed Geraldine shaking
her head, and putting his hand into that of Alfred, who
shook it warmly.
"Yes, yes!-of course you're pleased! But I must
marry now. I shall ask Hélène at Bordeaux to have
me, as nobody there will know anything about my
present mishap.'
At this moment M. and Mme Delisle returned;
their astonishment was of course very great. Edouard
gravely introduced the young couple.

You see, madame,' he said, that while you were
walking round the garden, I have managed to lose my
wife, and you to find a son-in-law.'
But, my Geraldine,' exclaimed her mother, ' are you
not behaving very badly to Edouard?'
Not at all!' said the young man: 'I could not think
of marrying her. Look at her! Five minutes with
Alfred has done her more good than all her excursions

her turn, warmly shaking his hand.

It was now settled that the day should be spent at
the villa; that in the evening they should return to
Paris, without the count, who was to present himself
only next day. He agreed to own frankly to all his
friends the depth and sincerity of his affection, while
Edouard good-naturedly volunteered to tell every one
that he had been turned off-a promise which he gravely
kept, relating his discomfiture in a way that drew tears
of laughter from all his hearers.
And Geraldine and Alfred were married, to the
surprise of the world. They were both cured of their
former errors, and I know no instance of a happier
marriage than that of M. and Mme de Rougement.
He is now a member of the Legislative Assembly, and
is remarked for the liberality of his opinions-being
one of the many ex-legitimists who have gone over to
the moderate republican party. Edouard married his
country cousin. Both young couples have children,
and both are happy: the only revenge the young man
having taken is to persevere on all occasions, even
before his own wife, in calling Geraldine The Stolen
Rose.'
APPLICATION OF ELECTRO - MAGNETIC
POWER TO TRANSIT ON RAILWAYS.
ONE of the most wonderful characteristics of scientific
discovery is the singular way in which every advance
connects itself with past phases of progress. Each
new victory over the stubborn properties of matter not
only gives man increase of power on its own account,
but also reacts on older conquests, and makes them
more productive. Thirty years ago, Davy and Arago
observed that iron-filings became magnetic when lying
near a wire that was carrying a current of galvanic
electricity. Since then powerful temporary magnets
have been made for various purposes by surrounding
bars of soft iron by coils of copper-wire, and transmitting
electric currents through these. In fact, it has been
ascertained that iron always becomes a magnet when
electricity is passed round it. The alarum-bells of the
electric telegraphs are set ringing by a simple applica-
tion of this principle. A conducting wire is made to
run for hundreds of miles, and then coils itself round
an iron bar. Electric currents are sent at will through
the hundreds of miles of wire, and the inert iron
becomes an active magnet. Observe the clerk in the
Telegraph Office at London. When he jerks the handle
that is before him, he turns on a stream of electricity
that runs to Liverpool or Edinburgh, as the case may
be. In either of those places a piece of iron that is
twisted round with the extremity of the wire becomes
a magnet for an instant, and attracts to itself a steel
armature that is connected with a train of wheelwork.
The motion of the armature, as it is drawn up to the
magnet, sets free a spring that was before kept quiet;
and this gives token of its freedom by making an
alarum-bell to ring. The clerk in London awakens the
attention of the clerk in Edinburgh by turning a piece
of soft iron placed near to the latter into a magnet for
a few seconds. He is able to do this because currents
of electricity induce magnetism in iron. This, and this
alone, is the secret principle to which he is indebted
for the wonderful power that enables him to annihilate
space when he instantaneously attracts the attention of
an ear hundreds of miles away.
We have recently shewn how this electro-magnetic
induction has been made a means for the instantaneous
registration of astronomical observations. We have
already to draw attention to another practical applica-
tion of the principle. M. Niklès has just invented an
arrangement of apparatus that enables him to make
the wheels of locomotives bite the rails with any
degree of force without increasing the weight that has
to be carried to the extent of a single grain. Our
readers are aware that in wet weather the driving-
wheels of locomotives often slip round upon the rail
without acquiring the power of moving the weight
that is attached behind them. Whenever they are
asked to ascend inclined planes with a weight that is
beyond the adhesive powers of their wheels this result
invariably follows; and the only practical escape from
the difficulty hitherto has been the adoption of one of
two expedients-either to increase their own intrinsic
weight, so that the earth's attraction might bind the
wheels down more firmly, or to let the railway be level
and the load to be dragged proportionally light. In
either of these cases a waste of power is experienced.
Power is either expended in moving a superfluous load,
or the same amount of power drags less weight even
upon a level rail than it otherwise could upon an
ascending one, that would have required less outlay in
its construction. It therefore becomes a great deside-
ratum to find some means of making the locomotive
wheels bite more tenaciously without increasing the
load they have to carry. The important problem of
how to do this it is that M. Niklès has solved.
If our readers will take a common horse - shoe
magnet, and slide the connecting slip of steel that rests
upon its ends backwards and forwards, they will feel
that the slip sticks to the magnet with a certain degree
of force. M. Niklès' plan is to convert the wheel of
the locomotive into a magnet, and make it stick to the
iron rail by a like adhesion. This he does by placing
a galvanic battery under the body of the engine. A
wire coming from the poles of this battery is then
coiled horizontally round the lower part of the wheel,
close to the rail, but in such a way that the wheel turns
round freely within it, fresh portions of its circum-
ference coming continually into relation with the coil.
The part of the wheel in immediate contact with the
rail is thus made magnetic, and therefore has a strong
adhesion for the surface along which it moves-and
the amount of the adhesion may be increased or dimi-
nished at any time, by merely augmenting or reducing
the intensity of the galvanic current that circulates
through the surrounding coil. By means of a handle
the electricity may be turned on or off, and an effectual
break be thus brought into activity that can make the
iron rail smooth or adhesive according to the require-
ments of the instant, and this without in any way
interfering with the free rotation of the wheels as the
friction-breaks of necessity do. Increased adhesion is
effected by augmented pressure, but the pressure
results from an attraction that is altogether indepen-
dent of weight. The lower portion of the wheel for
the time being is in exactly the same condition as a bar
of soft iron placed within a coil of wire circulating
electricity. But as it rises up out of the coil during
the rotation of the wheel, it grows less and less
magnetic, the descending portions of the opposite side
of the circumference acquiring increased magnetic
power in the like degree.
M. Niklès' experiments have been made with large
locomotives in full operation; and he states as the
result, that the velocity of the wheel's motion does not
in any way affect the development of the magnetic

force. He finds the condition of the rail, as regards
wetness or dryness, to be quite unimportant to the
success of his apparatus, and he has already managed
by its aid to achieve an ascent as rapid as one in five.

Valley of the Shadow of Death-going out, out, like

and my only work left is the requiem- my own
requiem-at which I must ply like the aged spinster

death of you if you give room to these fantasies. They
are not worthy of you, Wolfgang: play the man, and
cease to impede your recovery by these miserable
delusions. You shall write many an opera buffa yet,
at which we'll laugh in concert, and some scores of
requiems for dull, rich, old burgesses, apoplectic and
sexagenarian, for whom they are more in place————

which you composed during a game at billiards, as I
remember well.
M. You are right. Do you know I lie in bed every
evening with my watch in my hand, while you robust
fellows at the Opera are playing my 'Zauberflöte,' and
follow in imagination every bar of the music, saying to
myself: Now they are putting the finale touches to
the overture; now Schach is running away from the
serpent; now Schickaneder is tripping forth as Papa-
geno with his bird-cage, or puffing away at the magic
flute-
S. That's better than brooding over a requiem, dis-
obeying doctors, and distressing a devoted wife; and

In other respects the contrasts between the two

groans under the most absolute bondage, being subject
to fines guaranteed by the deposit of a large caution-
money for a daily paper à thousand pounds, which, if
diminished by a fine, must be made up again before
the reappearance of the journal-and to seizure by the
police. It is under the most arbitrary regulations as to
sale. For example, no liberal paper is allowed to be
sold in the streets where the monarchical prints are
permitted to hawk their treason against the Republic
unmolested. Such inconsistency under a republican
government appears almost incredible; nevertheless

tion on the wickedness of throwing egg-shells into the
street, which to more confiding readers must have
proved highly edifying and commendable.
THE PEACE MOVEMENT.
THREE or four years ago, an association sprang up with
the purpose of fostering a spirit of peace and a hatred
of war in all its forms. Grave doubts have been enter-
tained as to the utility of such an association. It is
alleged that all persons would naturally prefer peace to
war, but that circumstances may compel an appeal to
arms; and that so long as bad passions have sway, it is
As a sort of counterpoise to its political bondage, the
stamp on a French newspaper is only one-half that
imposed in England, and paper duties are unknown.
Hence arises a further important distinction between
the press of France and that of her island neighbour.
There are several daily newspapers published in Paris,
edited and contributed to by the most distinguished
men of the day, the price of which is only two sous,
or one penny the number. Three sous is the price of
the more expensive journals. Their sale is of course
proportional to their price, and their influence conse-desirable to be prepared for the worst-that, indeed, a
quently much more extended than in England, where a
daily paper is a luxury absolutely forbidden to the
poorer and working-classes. Hence the French, as a
nation, are much farther advanced in political know-
ledge, right or wrong, than the English; and far more
excited and impatient on the subject of reforms which
the dominant class-that is to say, the bureaucracy—
naturally delay and oppose by every means in their
power.
Now in France at least one adult in ten is either a
soldier, a placeman, or a police spy. No wonder that
the revolution sits en permanence in the brains of French
philosophers, and the hearts of French poets and
patriots, when a tenth of the population consume more
than a fifth of the total revenue of a country in which
the result of an equal division of property would give
about sevenpence
a day to every citizen shareholder.
Thus the want of abuses to attack or propose reme-
dies for is not one of the misfortunes of a French
journalist, and newspapers flourish accordingly.
**
well-organised force, by acting as a terror, is the best
preservative of general tranquillity. The question,
therefore, may be said to admit of some degree of
controversy. Truth is to a certain extent on both
sides.
However the matter may be argued, it will be univer-
sally allowed that war is a bad thing, and has produced
most lamentable consequences as regards even the
present generation. The difficulty is to know how to
render its recurrence impossible. It is evident that the
vast majority of mankind are in a state of shocking
barbarism, and that it is only here and there that really
civilised and orderly dispositions prevail. Roll out the
map of the world, and let any man lay his finger on
the country where the people are so thoroughly imbued
with correct feelings as to render armed force amongst
them undesirable. We hear much of the spread of
social improvements. Thankful we are for all recog-
nisable signs of advancement; but all that has been
done is but a light let in upon darkness, and only shews
what is still left to be effected in the way of general
illumination. Little more than three years ago, a
progress of a general sack was stayed only by military
force. As long as large cities are exposed to contin-
gencies of this kind-in short, until the very humblest
orders of the community know how to regulate their
feelings-it is hopeless to expect an utter annihilation
of that desperate and ultimate resource-warlike
enginery. Then as to foreign countries. Look no
further than France: it is a universal encampment
a nation armed to the teeth in dread of social out-
break, and possessing a fatal proneness to pick quarrels
with peaceably-disposed neighbours.
On the other hand, the great, unstamped press, which
in England does so much for the education and civilis-
ation of the people, is entirely unknown in France,
owing to the police restrictions thrown round every-disorderly mob had possession of Glasgow, and the
thing connected with print and paper in that republic
of contradictions. The place of these amusing and in-
structive periodicals is feebly supplied by the feuilleton
of the daily papers (weeklies are rare--they suit not the
feverish progress of events in a revolutionary state.)
In these are published tales, literary and dramatic criti-
cism, and articles of various kinds, by the belletristic
writers of France. But as the novels of Alexander
Dumas absorb the greater portion of the feuilletons of
the best circulated journals, they offer small field either
for literary aspiration or for popular instruction. How-
all classes in France are at present so busy seek-
ing what they call a solution in politics, that they
do not perhaps feel very keenly the want of lighter
nutriment for their minds on the one hand, or more
enduring literature on the other.
ever,
The writers of French journals are simply all the
men of note and talent in France, who rarely fail to
defend with their pens in a newspaper the principles
they have advocated with their lips in the House of
Assembly. Even the very subs and penny-a-liners, as
we should call them in England, are mostly ambitious
though penniless young adventurers, whose future it is
not often easy to prophesy. Their boldness of inven-
tion, when a corner is to be filled up at all hazards by
an extempore canard,' or 'duck,' as it is termed, is
truly admirable. We were much amused by reading
in a French evening paper the other day how, owing to
some egg-shells being thrown down in the street, an
unfortunate cab-horse fell down, and his feet sliding out
in opposite directions, broke all four legs on the spot.
'The knacker,' continues the duck-maker, was hu-
manely sent for, to put the poor animal out of its
*Proudhon calculates seventy-five centimes-a fraction beyond
sevenpence per head per diem.
It would, we think, be the height of folly for the
advocates of peace principles to ignore the existence
everywhere of a reasonable apology for maintaining a
certain apparatus of defence against violence. The
world is not to be trusted. That is the terrible misfor-
tune. But this very want of confidence is the best of
all arguments for the spread of such principles as tend
to obviate a recourse to the sword. Let all peoples be
educated up to the point at which war inspires senti-
ments of horror and detestation, and the thing is done.
The mission of the Peace Society, as we suppose, is
to promote this species of culture; and so far its aim
cannot but meet with approval. A very important end
will be gained in merely bringing contiguous nations to
a knowledge of each other. Mutual suspicions and
misapprehensions have led in past times to proclama-
tions of war; and diplomacy, with all its cost and pre-
tensions, it is grievous to say, has seldom been of any
avail in these serious conjunctures. How different, in
all probability, would have been the result in the case
of the first American and French revolutionary war
had the two disputing parties-the people, not diplo-
matists-been brought face to face to state their diffe-
rences in an honest spirit of adjustment! It is to be
hoped that on any future occasion for national dispute,

the people on each side will distinctly avow the wish
for an amicable settlement. And yet, notwithstanding
this expectation, are not the peace-loving English at
present carrying on a war against the Caffres without
compunction, probably without knowing the merits of
the case?-certainly, so far as appearances are con-
cerned, without the wish to learn anything at all
about it!
So.

It is clear that anything short of a very general
enlightenment and pervading spirit of humanity will
inevitably fail to avert the recurrence of war, whether
on a small or large scale. Material progress, advance-
ment in the industrial arts, are obviously inadequate
towards the suppression of barbaric contests. At the
late Peace Congress in London, presided over by Sir
David Brewster, it was well observed by M. Coquerel,
that moral and religious convictions are indispensable
in promoting national aversion for war. It is quite
true,' he remarked, that railways, electricity, inter-
national exhibitions of universal industry, draw people
together, strengthen the bonds of their intimacy, and
tend to render peace permanent; but the people must
know this and feel it too, and you are here to tell them
You are here at this moment, the conscience of
humanity; and it is in virtue of this title that you are
arresting its attention to a great change which is now
taking place in its very heart and centre, but which
ought not to, and cannot be realised, unless it have the
knowledge of it. You are revealing what is passing in
its own bosom, and are hastening progress by the mani-
festation of it. This is the end of this Congress. You
are right, then, not to attribute the destinies of your
cause to the material developments of industry. You
are right in requiring of all those who have assumed
the office of instructing human nature-of all those
who listen to it; of ministers of religion, teachers, and
journalists, that they should boldly take this grand
work in hand. Teachers can do much. They have
in this respect an important change to operate in the
ideas of humanity, because up to the present time
the youthful generation have been instructed according
to a system of education and of history absolutely
false, and in which war has been made to appear, and
has been regarded not only as one of the greatest and
noblest things in this world, but as the chief of all that
is greatest and noblest. It is war which, according to
this system, has monopolised all the men of history,
and which in history itself holds the first place. It
would appear as though past ages had nothing more
instructive to impart to us than an interminable list
of sieges and battles. We have all of us read Roman
history, to wit. Well, in studying it through the
medium of those admirable writers who have trans-
mitted it to our days, we have all of us perhaps been
led away by the charms of their style, and the spirited-
ness of their narrative, and ranged ourselves with
them on the side of oppression, of perfidious policy,
of insatiable ambition, and of ferocious and frenetic
pride, against weakness and good right. And in fact
the history of Rome is but an endless poem, a long
romance, of which war is the subject, and in which all
is exaggeration and forgery. I behold continually
passing before my wearied eyes the triumphal car of
the victor; I hear the loud and prolonged acclamations,
and the boisterous shouts of inebriate admiration and
joy which greet him on his passage; but I never hear
the frantic sobs of orphans and the maledictions of
mothers. Yet in this false order of ideas is youth
brought up. When war is spoken of to children it is
exhibited to them not in its reality, but under brilliant
and deceptive appearances. The troops are shewn to
them arrayed in order, as they set out on the march
for the battle-field, to the sound of the trumpet, clothed
in uniforms of gaudy colours, bedizened with trappings,
shining with tinsel and spangles, their feathers and
plumes waving, their banners floating in the breeze,
and yielding to every puff; their murderous arms
glittering in the sunshine, and that-that is shewn to
their infant minds, and pointed out as war! Ah! why
not rather shew us-why not shew your children that
same army on its return? Or rather explain to them
why out of all those thousands of men so few come
back. Why not tell them where the rest are? Then
they would see plumes and feathers broken--but never
mind that: standards torn and ripped, helmets and
cuirasses beaten in, and swords snapped in twain-
never mind even that: but what would matter, they
would see and understand what had become of those
manly hearts which were so recently throbbing beneath
those cuirasses of those noble fronts on which God
had impressed the stamp of his own image, and which
so lately beamed with a scintillation of his own immor-
tality and intelligence. To this very day, when glory
has been spoken of either to men or to children, mili-
tary glory has been vaunted at the expense of glory of
every other kind. Military glory has been accepted as
something grand and noble: but what if it presented
itself to our view as the accomplice of Macbeth-its
hands dripping with blood! Then errors must be
dissipated, and henceforth only that kind of glory
must be accepted as belonging to the first class which
shall be guiltless of human blood. Teachers must
instruct children to know that there are other kinds of
glory far more brilliant than that which hovers over
camps and over gory battle-fields.'
In concluding his eloquent address, M. Coquerel
took occasion to rebuke the tendency to be jocular at
the expense of the movement in which he and others
were engaged. Why there should be any sarcasm
expended on the principles professed by the society we
are at a loss to understand. So far from feeling any
desire to hold up this respectable association to ridi-
cule, we would pass over any eccentricities in its
operations as things too inconsiderable for notice, and
candidly anticipate that it may prove of vast use in
spreading and confirming those habits of thought
which lead to the conservation of national tranquillity.
PHILE.
Ir was a cheerful morning early in January last that
we started that is, five or six ladies and gentlemen-
to visit the island of Philo, which had grown every
day more attractive to our imagination. A short ride
among ruins and over rocks brought us into the great
cemetery of the ancient city of Essooân; and after
passing this, and leaving the way to Mahatta on our
right, we began to enter a series of rugged defiles,
which we made merry with pleasant talk and laughter.
Not more than an hour after starting, we got among
trees and houses, at a place called Birbé; and a little
beyond came down to a busy landing-place, where
boats were crowding, men shouting, women screaming,
donkeys braying, and camels grunting as they received
their load. The Nile, glittering in the sun, lapsed, as
it were, in sheets of light from amidst precipitous rocks
on the left, and disappeared amidst low, stony islands
on the right. We might have heard the roar of the
neighbouring cataracts, but the buzz of life near at
hand was too violent. A short altercation introduced
us to a ferry-boat; and having sent back our donkeys,
we started for the yet invisible Philœ.
A puff of wind dropping opportunely into the sail,
carried us across a narrow rock-bound pass, up which
we were to creep on the other side against the mighty
current. It then fell away, leaving us whirling in a
little creek, and exerting ourselves, not very suc-
cessfully, to prevent our dashing against the huge
boulders that obstruct the stream.
Poles and a rope
were soon got into play; and, after slipping back once
or twice, we at length began to make steady progress,
though slow. I have often beheld scenes on a far

grander scale, but never
er any more wild and interesting.
To give an idea of it in a few words, I will say that we
seemed to be in the reach of a river surrounded and
narrowed almost a torrent by the accumulated ruins
of Druidical temples. The island of Biggeh on one
hand, and the main on the other, seemed entirely com-
posed of a collection of huge boulders, among which,
here and there, a few shrubs with twinkling green
leaves were to be seen. Many isolated rocks obstructed
the course of the stream, and we had sometimes to be
dragged by main force between them the gunwales
grating on either side. It was an exciting little journey;
and I confess that our feelings were worked up to a
very high pitch when we saw another boat backing
down on the opposite bank, in spite of the efforts of
the men, who held on by ropes, and then breaking
loose, go spinning away, we thought, in the direction
of the cataracts: not that we anticipated fatal
accident; but the fact was, that the boat contained
our baggage, our servants, and, above all, our pro-
visions. We could afford no assistance, but crawled
on, gloomily anticipating a late dinner.
"I do not intend attempting to give a topographical
description of the island of Phile, nor to restore in
imagination" what time has overthrown. The learned
might dispute my conclusions, or smile contemptuously
at my arrogance. A few words will convey an idea of
the chief features of interest. At the southern ex-
tremity, where the Nile is seen winding into the Nubian
ravine-at length free from obstructions and in all its
placid majesty was evidently of old the chief approach
of the island, overlooked by an immense naked rock.
Two colonnades, of different styles of architecture, lead
obliquely to a gate, flanked by the usual pyramidal
towers, this admits you into a court, with chapels on
either hand, and terminated by another gate and two
other towers. Beyond is a smaller court, partly covered
in by a massive roof, supported by gigantic columns;
then succeed in some confusion dark passages and
darker rooms, devoted no doubt to the more mysterious
ceremonies of the yet unexplained religion of the
ancient Egyptians.

which appears, as the wilderness, of granite is cloven
by the shining stream, to totter in the sunshine over
these verdant and waving groves.
Philo lies between the southern extremity of Biggeh
and the eastern bank. As we turned towards it,
beneath some lofty boulders covered with hieroglyphics,
the prospect widened, and villages, strips of cultiva-
tion, and groves appeared. But these were soon again
hidden by the island itself, under the steep bank of
which we were carried by another friendly puff.
Though pretty well used to, antiquity-hunting, we were
scarcely prepared for the profusion of objects that here
burst upon us, soliciting our notice: vast temples, dimi-
nutive chapels, altars, shrines, obelisks, colonnades, all
fanned by a rebellious vegetation we ran over all,
and came back confused and perplexed, like a rustic
who has turned up the concealed entrance of a cave of
untold treasure with his plough, and stands not know-
ing what to take-the diamonds or the coins, the vases
or the robes of price until the guardian demon comes
swooping down like a black cloud, and reduces him to
a heap of cinders, or changes him into an ape. Our
reveries were interrupted by a genteel imp named
Haroon, who, instead of exercising any diabolical arts of
magic, announced that the provision-boat had arrived,
and that dinner was laid in the tent. I know not why
We had heard of a curious succession of passages in
the eastern wall of the temple, and went of course to ex-
plore them. We leaped down a kind of well, and found,
first, a room to the left without ornament or sculpture.
Leaving this, we followed the passage to the end, and
reached a square hole overhead. So we got up with
some difficulty, and retraced our steps in the same
direction until we saw another hole at the opposite end,
which led to a similar passage; and so on for several
storeys as it were. I was at first inclined to think that
the builders had employed this artifice to give the wall
an appearance of immense solidity without wasting
stone; but a succession of narrow horizontal air-holes,
artfully concealed on the outside, seemed to suggest a
purpose of utility. We thrust out twigs from those in
the upper passage, and found that they were not much
more than half-way up the wall. It is probable, there-
fore, although no other opening has yet been discovered,
that this was a secret way to some of the chambers
now buried in rubbish at the north-east corner of the
temple.."
On returning downwards, just as we were going to
drop into the lower passage, we observed that at one
side of the square hole there was a large stone hedged
into what appeared to be an aperture or entrance of a
chamber. It struck us that this might have escaped
the observation of preceding visitors anxious to proceed
higher and higher, and now

a hopeless undertaking. The stone was about three

supported by a small projection on one side, and that it
bung over the passage below more than half its width.

consoled ourselves by reflecting that we had increased
the facility of access to the passage. Our Arabs, how
ever, looked ruefully about, and asked: Where was the

off along a pleasant path that took us between fields
and meadows, and through groves and villages nestling
at the base of the Arabian chain of hills. All the
houses in those parts are neater outside, and seem more
spacious within than the Arab hovels. Over the door
of one of them we noticed an English dinner-plate, with
the Chinese-bridge-and-pagoda pattern, built in as an
ornament. The people, so far as we saw anything

alive. He retreated to his eyry, and defended himself
with desperation, hurling down huge stones on the
assailants. They wished at first to avoid killing him,
that he might be made an example of at Essouân, but
were at length driven to use their muskets; and the
black brigand, covered with wounds, was obliged to
retreat within his tower. For some time none ventured
to follow him; but two of the stoutest hearts were
prevailed upon to make the attempt. As they ap-
proached the door a savage roar startled them. They
had only time to fall back ere the giant appeared,
blinded with blood flowing from a wound in his fore-
head. He had heard their footsteps, and knew that all
was over; so, after vainly endeavouring to grasp at one
of them, he leaped down the precipice to the road, and
was killed by the fall.
Such was the story which was told to us in a low
trembling voice as we wended our way along the
darkening defile. Our donkey-boys seemed afraid lest
a successor of this formidable robber might be lurk-
ing about to overhear them. But we saw not a living
being, until having passed the cemetery, and the ruins,
and the grove, we reached the bustling beach near
which our boat was moored. Here all was yet alive.
A dozen travellers' dahabichs were lighted up for the
evening: some had lanterns swinging from their yards.
Two enormous sails were coming slowly up in the
moonlight. We knew that some friends were arriving,
and felt called upon to fire a salute; but I am sorry
to be obliged to record that the roar of eight guns
was entirely drowned by the screaming of an Arab
maid-servant on board the new-coming boat, and that
it reached its mooring-ground perfectly unconscious of
our politeness.
THE PERVERSE WIDOW.
It is pleasant now and then for the lover of books to
let the headlong flow of our present literature pass on
unheeded, and fix his thoughts and his eyes upon some
first love of his taste. It is like bringing back the
freshness of youth, and, as it were, gilding the evening
twilight with a beam of the early sun, so as to give
sadness as well as glory to the picture. The old book
--the book we treasured in youth-is no doubt some-
what the worse for wear in its externals, and so for that
matter is the young girl we loved in the same years.
But they are both unchanged in the inner part, for our
memory defies alike dust and wrinkles, dogs' ears and
seven children.
But a transformation sometimes occurs with books
from which women, unhappily, are debarred: the book
becomes young again, even in the material part, and is
more radiant than ever. Here, for instance, is one of
the most elegant old-new volumes in the world, adorned
with all the luxury of modern art, and on opening it
we discover that it is the history of our ancient friend
Sir Roger de Coverley.* And it opens, too, at a part
which sets all our sympathies flowing, and calls up
pity and smiles at the same moment--SIR ROGER IN
LOVE. O that perverse widow, with the coldest
heart and the finest hand in the world! she who, in
spite of his state as sheriff, his handsome dress, gallant
air, and the feather in his cap, slew the good knight in
open court with one beam of her bewitching eye. She
was a reading lady, too, this widow, a desperate scholar,
and a terror to country gentlemen. She was of opinion,
however, that Sir Roger was the tamest and most
humane of all the brutes in the country; and on this
flattering encouragement he determined to advance.
But it would not do. She received him with a discourse
which the best philosopher in Europe could not have

Illustrations by W. Henry Wills: the Engravings by Thompson,
from Designs by Fred. Tayler. London: Longman. 1850.
surpassed, and then she put her hand to her bosom—
the finest hand in the world-and adjusted her tucker.
'O the excellent creature! she is as inimitable to
all women as she is inaccessible to all men!'
-
Mr Wills, we need hardly say, does not let the widow
pass without mention in his highly interesting' notes
and illustrations.' The notion,' says he, that the
perverse widow had a living, charming, provoking
original, has been more prevalent and better sup-
ported than that respecting any of the rest of the
Coverley characters. Although a mere outline-
hinted rather than delineated amidst the picturesque
group of last century figures-she is so suggestively
shadowed forth that the reader himself insensibly vivi-
fies the outline, feels her ascendancy, and doubles his
pity for her kind-hearted victim. "The dignity of her
aspect, the composure of her motion," and the polish of
her repartee-heightened by the foil of her spiteful
confidant - make us participate in Sir Roger's awe;
and while we sympathise with his ardent admiration,
we tremble for the hapless presumption that aspires to
"the finest hand of any woman in the world." Her
subtlety was unbounded. No coquette commands suc-
cess who, besides varied resources, cannot ply her art
with the chastest dexterity; and the widow's omnipo-
tence was attained less by her personal charms and
mental graces, than by the delicacy of her lures and
the nice discrimination with which they were spread.'
Who was this widow? That she had a real existence
cannot be doubted. Both Addison and Steele, it
seems, suffered from sharp, polished, perverse widows;
but Mr Wills-innocent of the pun-inclines like other
commentators to the Steele widow. "The informa-
tion on which this belief is grounded is derived from
Chalmers through Archdeacon Nares, to whom it was
communicated by the Rev. Duke Yonge of Plympton,
in Devonshire. "My attention," says the reverend
gentleman," was first drawn to this subject by a very
vague tradition in the family of Sir Thomas Crawley
Boevey of Flaxley Abbey, in Gloucestershire, that Mrs
Catherine Boevey, widow of William Boevey, Esq.,
and who died January 21, 1726, was the original from
whence the picture of the perverse widow in the 'Spec-
tator' was drawn. She was left a widow at the early
age of twenty-two, and by her portrait (now at Flaxley
Abbey, and drawn at a more advanced period of her
life) appears to have been a woman of a handsome,
dignified figure, as she is described to have been in the
113th number of the 'Spectator.' She was a personage
well known and much distinguished in her day, and is
described very respectably in the New Atalantis under
the name of Portia."' Steele, the author of the papers
in the Spectator' which describe the widow, was an
admirer of this Mrs Boevey, and inscribed a volume
to her in a dedication which tallies with the portrait
of the perverse widow. 'Sir Roger tells his friend that
she is a reading lady, and that her discourse was as
learned as the best philosopher could possibly make.
She reads upon the nature of plants, and understands
everything. In the dedication Steele says: "Instead of
assemblies and conversations, books and solitude have
been your choice; you have charms of your own sex,
and knowledge not inferior to the most learned of
ours." In No. 118, "her superior merit is such," says
Sir Roger," that I cannot approach her without awe;
my heart is checked by too much esteem." Dedica-
tion.-"Your person and fortune equally raise the
admiration and awe of our whole sex.' They had both
female confidants, or, as we should now call them,
companions; but Mrs Boevey had no lawsuit. There
is a discrepance, too, in chronology; but this, Mr
Wills tells us, weighs not a feather in the scale of
evidence; no true artist copies every trait of his subject,
and the verisimilitude is not diminished because the
Gloucestershire enslaver was younger and not so liti-
gious as the Worcestershire enchantress. Mrs Boevey

died January 21, 1726-7, in her fifty-seventh year, and
was buried in the family vault at Flaxley, with an
inscription on the walls of the chapel to her memory.
There is also a monument to her in Westminster Abbey,

Notwithstanding the testimony of this monument,
we are of the editor's opinion-that 'Sir Roger's widow
will never die!'

twelve of those companies who have contracts with the
government for the conveyance of mails. The number
of steamers employed in conveying sea-borne letters is
nearly 100 the horse-power of which is about 30,000,
and the tonnage 80,000. The value of these steamers is
not less than L.3,000,000 sterling. The aggregate sum
which the mail-packet companies receive annually from
government for conveying mails is about L.730,000.
The number of miles which their packets traverse in the
course of a year is about 2,000,000-nearly nine times
the distance of the earth from the moon, and about
eighty times greater than the circumference of the globe.
The mail-packet stations at the present time are
Southampton, London, Liverpool, Holyhead, Plymouth,
Aberdeen, and Lerwick; of these stations Southampton
is the most important. Three large English steam-
packet companies have made it their station, who own
40 out of the 100 steamers employed in the mail-ser-
vice, and the horse-power of which is 14,000, and the
tonnage about 40,000. Out of the L.730,000 paid by
government for mail-service, the Southampton companies
receive above L.477,000, or nearly two-thirds.
England is celebrated for the extent and perfection of
her mail-packet service; in fact, it may be said that she
carries the sea-borne correspondence of the whole world.
From east to west-between China and Chili, passing
through the four quarters of the globe; and from north
to south-between Hamburg and the Cape of Good Hope
-her great mail-packet lines extend; and from them an
immense number of branch - lines shoot out, many of
which are thousands of miles in length. England conveys
the over-sea correspondence of nearly every country with
the continent of Europe, the Peninsula, the coasts and
islands of the Mediterranean, India, China, Cape of Good
or Hong Kong: in like manner France, Denmark, Spain,
and Holland send their mails for their western colonies
and possessions by the Royal West India mail-packets.
The French government attempted a few years ago to
establish a transatlantic steam-packet communication,
but it turned out a disastrous and irretrievable failure.
The only nation that is likely to succeed in establishing
ocean mail-packet lines is America; from which it would
appear that the Anglo-Saxon race-who are probably
destined ultimately to people the principal portions of
the globe-are alone capable of keeping a footing, as it
were, on the great ocean pathways.
The history of the British mail-contract packet-service
is interesting, for the rapidity with which that service
has attained its present vast extent is astonishing.
About fourteen years ago, the Peninsular Steam-Navi-
gation Company contracted with the government for the
conveyance of the Spanish and Portuguese mails. Soon
after this, the problem of traversing the Atlantic by
steam was effectually solved by the successful voyages of
the Great Western steamer, and the British and North
American Steam-Packet Company was then formed, to
convey the United States and British-American mails.
In the meantime, the Peninsular Company had extended
their mail-packet operations to the Mediterranean; and
Lieutenant Waghorn having proved the practicability of
sending the Indian mail by way of Egypt, that company
(then become the Peninsular and Oriental Steam-Navi-
gation Company) placed mail-packets on the Red Sea and
Indian Ocean, and undertook the conveyance of that

DANGER OF MODELLING IN WAX.
Few persons, especially perhaps of the many young
ladies who are now practising the very pleasing art of
modelling fruit, flowers, &c. in wax, at all suspect the
great danger in which they are placed from the poisonous
nature of the colouring matter of the wax which they
handle so unsuspectingly. The white wax, for instance,
contains white lead; the green, copper; the yellow,
chrome yellow; the orange, chrome yellow and vermilion
-strong poisons all; while many other kinds of wax are
equally poisonous, and therefore dangerous. There are
very many persons who are aware of the intense sufferings
for many years past of Mr W. Bally, phrenologist and
modeller in wax. Mr Bally has been at times completely
paralysed, and is now, and has long been very nearly so,
especially in his hands and arms; and he has also been
afflicted with extensive ulceration of the throat, and has
almost totally lost his voice. Both himself and his
medical adviser, after a long attention to his symptoms,
are satisfied that the primary cause of his affliction is the
extent to which the subtle poisons in the wax with which
he has worked have been absorbed into his system
through the pores of his hands, while the disease has
been generally strengthened, and one part of it accounted
for, by the occasional application of his fingers to his
lips while at work. Mr Bally says that he has known
several cases in which young ladies have been attacked
with partial paralysis of the hands and arms, after hav
ing devoted some time to the practice of modelling, but
at the time he had no suspicion of the cause. As all
the requisite colours can be obtained from vegetable
matter, and as the use of mineral colouring seems to lead
to such deplorable results, the subject should be care-
fully investigated by those working with coloured wax.-

DIRTY WORK.'
Many people turn up their noses at what they call
'dirty work,' as though all honest labour was not cleaner
than many kid-glove ways of swindling one's way through
the world. Rather than owe our living to the latter, we
would infinitely prefer to shake carpets or sweep chim-
neys at fifty cents per day. A day or two since we
learned an instructive bit of history touching a doer of
dirty work '-a hodman. No matter where he was born
-he was none the worse for being a Turk-man or an
Irishman. He came to this city about ten years ago,
young, healthy, and honest; he could get no employ but
hod-carrying, and he carried so well as to earn at once
his dollar a day. He procured cheap but good board and
lodgings, spent none of his earnings in saloons or low
places, attended church on the Sabbath, educated him-
self in the evenings, laid up money, and at the end of
five years bought a lot in the city and built a pretty
cottage. In one year more he found a good wife, and
used the cottage, before rented out: for these six years
he had steadily carried the hod. He was a noted worker,
an acknowledged scholar, and a noble pattern of a man.
On the opening of the eighth year his talents and
integrity were called to a more profitable account: he
embarked as a partner in a business already well estab-
lished. This day he is worth at least 100,000 dollars,
has a lovely wife and two beautiful children, a home
that is the centre of a brilliant and intelligent circle; and
he is one of the happiest and most honourable men as far
as he is known. So much has come of a hodman.-New
York Tribune.
SUMMER.
BY CALDER CAMPBELL.
SUN-GOLD within her hair young Summer sings;
And the gay descant rings
O'er many a daily path, till Night
Clothes her an Amazon most fair-
In moony armour, quaint and rare,
By Cynthia fashion'd in her halls of light.
Blue-eyed young Summer smiles upon the earth,
That in its glee sends forth
A troop of flowers to say, 'All hail!'
And scatter sweetly as they pass
Odours that wile from bush and grass
Bees and bright-winged flies that flutter in the gale.
Light-footed as a fay young Summer dances,
The while to sweet romances
The nightingale attunes her voice
In woods where heat-struck deer repose-
Where, tinkling by, the streamlet flows,
And in its plashy depths the sleek, cool trout rejoice.
Sun-loving Summer there in quiet ease
Lieth 'neath rustling trees:
The priestly oaks that gravely spread
Their broad arms o'er the flowers below
In verdant benediction, throw
A refluent halo round her dreamy head.
There Summer, cool'd by zephyrs of the night,
Slumbereth to human sight,
Yet with great Nature duly runs
Her proper course, untir'd and true,
While Man, dull-ear'd, dim-sighted too,
Scarce hears or sees Night's songs or Morning's suns!
CLOTHING OF THE VEDDAHS, OR WILD MEN OF CEYLON.
Their ordinary clothing is manufactured from the bark
of trees. This, when gathered, is cut into pieces of a
convenient size; the inner coat is then separated from
the outer and steeped in water for a few hours; after
this it is beaten between two stones until it becomes
perfectly soft, smooth, and pliable; it is next dried, and
is then ready for use. As none of the pieces are singly
of sufficient size to form a garment, they generally sew
two together with a string or fibre obtained from the
descending shoots of the banyan-tree; this forms a cloth
about four and a half feet long and three feet wide, and
constitutes the whole clothing of the Veddah--his dress
by day, and his bed and blanket by night.-Green's
Report of the Wellicadde Gaol of Colombo.
NIGHTMARE.
The expression 'nightmare'is, Sir William Temple
says, from Mara in old Runic, who was a goblin said
to seize upon sleeping men, and take from them speech
and motion; for in those days medical science had not
made it plain to every one as it has now, that the goblin
in question is simply indigestion.
PLEASE THE PIGS.
lowest vulgar, was no more in its origin than Deo volente
The expression 'please the pigs,' now only used by the
God willing; and was a corruption from pyx or pyxis,
the vessel in which the host is kept-substituted for the

not meaning the brick and mortar, but a certain number
of representatives who sit in it.

WRONGS OF THE UNREADY.
'A MAD world, my masters!'-an odd, inconsistent,
unreasonable world. If you were to go over the whole
list of the planets (and that is no such easy matter
now), it may be doubted whether you would find a more
stupid and perverse world. We are overwhelmed with
complaints of it; and in fact, judging by our corres-
pondence, we are driven to suspect that the notion is
spreading pretty generally over society that we have a
hand in it ourselves. How some people rise in this
ridiculous world?-how other people sink?--and how
the rest stand stock-still?-are questions that are put
to us every day at the point of the pen; and we are
commanded by scores of constant readers to tell them
instantly, and without prevarication, what is the way to
get on in it. Numberless are the gems of purest ray
screne that desire to be informed how they can emerge
from dark unfathomed caves, where they can no more
shine than the Koh-i-noor; and numberless the blush-
ing flowers that impart to us in confidence their long
ing to be seen when blushing, and to give forth their
fragrance in public.
It appears to be a pretty generally received opinion,
that the world has combined to ignore the talent it
contains; that employers have a natural hankering
after incompetence; and that, even when they take the
trouble of selecting, they always, by some fatality or
other, pick out the wrong men. This explains why it
is that editors invariably reject the good articles they
are offered, and insert and pay for all the trash they
can get. It likewise seems to be a prevalent belief,
that everybody is fit for some higher kind of work than
he is about, and that he wants for nothing to succeed in
it but to discover what the work is. Some think they
would get on better as authors than as merchants or
tradesmen, and beg us to advise them (on the strength
of an article they send) to invest their realised capital
in a ream of paper, a box of steel pens, and a bottle of
ink, and start at once in the profession. Many of this
class look to poetry with a superstitious faith, inherited
apparently from the times when verses were incantations;
and they enclose specimens of their Runic rhymes
enough to make a nervous person's hair stand on end.
One young gentleman is in the predicament of Mr
Dickens's Youngest Gentleman in the boarding-house:
he is not understood' by the people about him. He is a
traveller in a foreign country, ignorant of the language,
and would be glad to know how he is to get along; and
he is likewise a castaway on a desert island, and would
trouble us to inform him how he is to secure his coffee
and toast in the morning. It is this young gentleman's
poetical images that have led us to think of the Wrongs
of the Unready.
PRICE 1d.
An actual traveller in a foreign country (for such is
the world) would he laughed at for his complaint; he
would be desired at once to learn the language.' An
actual castaway would be informed, that if he had not
something of the skill and ingenuity of a Crusoe, he must
be content to support life as long as he could on the
shell-fish of the shore on which the waves had thrown
him. If we examine the complaints of this kind that
are made by those who are only metaphorically
travellers and castaways, we shall discover, in nine
cases out of ten, that their want of success is owing to
their want of preparation for the contests of the world.
An aspiring shopman is conscious of something within
him which is above his business; and when he sees
individuals round him, 'no better than himself,' de-
tached every now and then from their position, and
floated off on the waves of fortune, he accuses the world
of injustice. But, in point of fact, the world has not
sense enough to be unjust. It has no discrimination,
no knowledge, no instinct; it is a mere soulless mass,
like the winds or waves, moving now gently, and now
furiously, in eternal undulations, and catching blindly
at the salient points it meets. If our shopman, instead
of grumbling, had inquired minutely into the circum-
stances of his fortunate neighbours, he would have
found that there was something about them exposed to
the influence of the stream which he did not possess:
some knowledge, some accomplishment, even some
point of external manners, which would account for
their being favoured with an influence that did not
extend to him.
A curious observer will frequently be struck with
the insignificance of this something which forms the
destiny of men-with the singular inadequacy of the
cause to the event-and he will be led to conclude that
there is no knowledge, however mean, and no talent,
however lowly in its sphere, that is not deserving of
respect and encouragement. In a family, in a part of
the country that shall be nameless, there was a little
boy who exposed himself to the ridicule of his com-
panions by his effeminacy. He was more partial to a
needle and thread than to a stick and line, and liked
better sewing clouts with his little sisters at home than
fishing partans with the other boys at the Roperie
Quay. Now it happened that a distant relation-a
very great man, an army agent in London-visited the
town, and the mother of the family was wildly anxious
that he should take a liking to one of her boys, and
promote him to a situation in his counting-house. The
great man came to the house, and a very gentleman-
like man he was, though grave and stately in his man-
ners, and somewhat philosophical in his looks.

vocations, and did not seem specially interested in the

success of the partan-fishing; but he looked long and
critically at the seams of the needle-boy, and finally
decided upon him as the fittest of the family for his
patronage. He carried him to London, made a tailor
of him, and lived to see his protégé a wealthy army-
clothier and contractor.
To suppose that there was anything meritorious in
this boy being the architect of his own fortunes, or at
least in his laying the corner-stone of them, would be
ridiculous. He took to the needle and thread as un-
consciously as the other boys to the stick and string,
and was borne away by the tide of circumstances with-
out a plan and without a hope. But such instances
are numerous enough to be seized upon by the new
science of statistics, and so enable close observers to
construct a theory, shewing the true nature of that
hitherto mystical process which it has been customary
to refer to accident, caprice, or the mere madness of
the world. We would say to a young man who
complains of his present situation in life: What do
you know of any other? What can you do? What are
you thoroughly acquainted with? What art, what
science have you penetrated? And the answer, in nine
cases out of ten, would be: That is just the difficulty:
I feel that I am capable of something else-something
higher, something nobler-but I don't know what it is!
Then learn, say we; learn something-learn anything
—learn dancing if you will. Dancing will give ease
and grace to your motions, and thus may have an
important effect upon your destiny. But whatever
you do learn, have no expectation of its instantly
catching the tide of circumstances. Bide your time.
The proverb says, that if you keep a thing ever so long
you will find a use for it; and that which you have
actually learned is a thing, and a thing usually of much
more value than any of the material property you may
lock up in your desk or store in a lumber-room.
In the Dublin University Magazine' of last month
there is an article containing sound advice to military
men, which falls well in with the subject of this
paper. No young officer, the author tells us, can say
at what moment his battalion may be ordered out to
India, and therefore every young officer should prepare
himself for the adventure by studying the two lan-
guages most in use in the country, each of which may
be acquired, with diligence, in a year. With these he
is qualified for any staff or civil appointment that may
fall in his way; without them he is only rank and file,
like the rest of his brethren, and can but fill a pit,
as Falstaff says, with better men.' But suppose his
battalion should not be ordered out to India at all?
Well, then, by pursuing the study, he may eventually
rise to distinction at home as an Oriental scholar;
and at the very least, it will enable him to fill up his
spare time much more agreeably than 'spitting over a
bridge, and then running to the other side to see it go
through!' Many military officers, it may be added,
have made their fortune by a knowledge of geology,
engineering, and other sciences, which they had studied
without the slightest prospect of ever being able to
turn them to practical account.
That such hints are much required by young mili-
tary men, no one who has lived in a garrison town can
be ignorant; yet many of our readers will be surprised
by the facts mentioned by the same author, and inclined
-and we hope with justice-to believe that they do
not apply to the present generation. The writer of
this article,' says he, served in the Mediterranean for
more than five years-from 1809 to 1814-and during
the whole of that time there were not half-a-dozen
officers of his regiment who ever thought of learning
Italian!' And again: We happened to have several
officers and three companies taken by a French detach-
ment at a town called Palmi in Calabria in 1809. They
were marched off from the heel of Italy to the centre
of France, to Verdun, the great depot of English
prisoners, where they remained for five long years, till
liberated by the peace of 1814. To the surprise of
all the regiment, when they rejoined, one only, the i
youngest of the party, could speak French!'
Nowhere is ignorance more obvious than in the class
of the writers of books. This may seem paradoxical,
but it is susceptible of proof. Travels and novels,
for instance, monopolise a great part of our literary
catalogues; but their contributions to knowledge are
in singularly small proportion to their bulk. A few
good novelists open out here and there new fields in
the knowledge of human nature; but the rest follow
blindly in the track, satisfied with incident instead of
character. The great majority of travellers apply
themselves exclusively to the vocation of the novelists,
dealing in the portraiture of manners and in personal
adventure, being wholly incompetent, through their
ignorance of geology, ethnology, botany, agriculture,
government, political economy, and other essentials, to
describe the country, the people, and their institutions.
These are the languages they ought to study before
setting forth on their foreign mission. We may be told
that most travel-writers are so by accident rather than
profession; but this only spreads the ignorance com-
plained of over a wider class of the community. It is
really wonderful how few tourists meet with the acci-
dent of instruction in useful knowledge of any kind
available to the accomplished traveller!
The Unready, therefore, are a very large class; and
we are not inclined to think that the modern system of
school-teaching diminishes their numbers to any consi-
derable extent. The addition of various branches to
Greek and Latin may increase the chance of the natural
genius finding among them its true path; but it will
not of itself induce study to any practical purpose. In
our early days the dead languages were the grand aim
and purpose of education; yet after spending the best
years of youth in this attempted acquisition, all but a
very few boys left the school in a state of nearly total
ignorance. To extend the sphere of instruction by
merely adding to the number of branches will not go a
great way in preventing this loss of time, unless the
youth is impressed with the necessity of learning some
of the languages of the foreign country of life for which
he is embarking, or of preparing himself with the
knowledge requisite to enable him to meet the hardships
of the desert isle of the world; and unless he is shewn
the ridicule of complaining of the consequences of
wilful ignorance as the wrongs of the Unready.
6
The state of mind disclosed by our correspondence,
in the utter unconsciousness of the Unready, presents a
highly curious study. Motives are assigned for the
alleged delinquency of the world which, if the world were
not an inorganic body, would excite its surprise. One
person, in the impossibility of conceiving any ordinary
reason why he should be left to moulder piecemeal on
the rock,' when so many of his companions have been
floated off by the tide, supposes the whole mischief to
arise from his not chancing to possess the proverbial
letter of introduction- a good countenance.' We have
no doubt that he is to some extent correct; for a good
countenance is the expression of an amiable, intelligent,
manly, or in the case of the other sex, womanly mind,
and is wholly irrespective of the material form of the
features or the colour of the skin.
We have likewise numerous illustrations of the
correctness of the Bible aphorism, that the heart
of man is above all things deceitful,' in the inge-
nuity with which some of the aspirants of the world
endeavour to persuade themselves-and us-that they
are performing a duty while they are merely grati-
fying a lazy inclination. It is hardly credible the
numbers of persons in this country who would make
poetry a business! Perhaps such dreamers may be
surprised to hear that we were assured by a poet of no
mean standing- the author of one of the best of

modern lyrics, 'There's kames o' honey on my love's
lips'-that he never made anything in his life by poetry
but his share of a half-crown bowl of punch! But it
must be owned that another acquaintance of ours was
more fortunate than Allan Cunningham. Finding that
a sonnet of his had appeared in a fashionable miscel-
lany, he was not satisfied with the immortality thus
obtained by his initials; but being rather surprised
that the expected cheque had not made its appearance,
he called at the publisher's, to jog the elbow of the man
of business. He was ushered into the private room,
when, after he had seated himself, the publisher, a tall,
portly gentleman, inquired his pleasure.
'I am the author of that sonnet in your last number.'
'Oh! sonnet? Ah! Well, sir?'
'Oh! I merely called,' said the visitor, feeling
awkward and turning red, 'just in the way of business,
to inform you that I am not an amateur author.'
'You want payment for that sonnet, do you?
Certainly, sir; certainly-all right:' and the bibliopole,
taking up the magazine it enriched, counted the lines
to see that the measure was good, and calculating
mentally its value per scale, presented the fortunate
poet with two shillings and sixpence.
But courage! Even to know how to rhyme is to
know something; and although the accomplishment is
not a marketable commodity, who knows what may
come of it otherwise? At any rate, tagging rhymes is
not so ridiculous an employment as complaining of the
Wrongs of the Unready.
THE POSTMAN OF THE VAL D'OSSAN.
"VOILA Monsieur La Poste!' cried Perronet.
The sound of a horn-a coarse, blaring noise-was
heard ere the exclamation was well uttered, and all
the loungers in the rustic tavern hurried to the door.
Surely enough there he was, Babillon the postman,
coming gallantly up, notwithstanding that he and his
little Navarre palfrey had travelled all the way from
Pau to Eaux Bonnes, and were bathed in an uncomfort-
able conglomeration of perspiration and dust. It was
May, and that is a warm month in the Val d'Ossan, but
the curling lip and twinkling eye of Postman Babillon
were more than a match for the sun. Spite of the
exhausting, prostrating fervour of the weather, never a
jot bated they of their saucy, gaillard air.
Never shall I forget the face of Postman Babillon: a
most pleasant face to meet with on the shoulders of a
man who lived a poor and laborious life. His sharp
black eyes and his ripe full lip seemed ever alive
with an expression of the acutest enjoyment. There
appeared to be an inexhaustible supply of some pun-
gent relish in the depths of the man's soul, that was
ever welling up with a mouth-watering intensity into
his eyes and lips. In joy, in sorrow, in leisure, in
labour, the strange light was always shining in the
face of Jean Babillon.
Some dozen rustics were gathered round Host Per-
ronet at the entrance of the little wayside tavern, whose
only sign was a wisp of straw suspended over the door;
and as Babillon rode up he was assailed by jokes and
merry exclamations from the lazy throng.
(

Ah, bon garçon Babillon, what have you got for
The postman let go his bridle, held up his letter-
bag with his left hand, and raising his long horn to his
mouth with his right, blew a loud blast.

Ah, ah! all that?'
Here, hold my stirrup, Jaques Bonhomme, and I
will shew you what I have. There's news-news—
news!'
'Bien, bien! Let us have it.'
'Summer's coming, autumn's coming, winter's com-
ing, and the maize is coming and the grapes; and the
wine-when is that coming, friend Perronet?'
፡
Ah, ha! a cup of wine for Jean Babillon! Haste,
Annette!'
'Wine for Jean Babillon, and water for the cheval
de poste! Le pauvre cheval!-six hours on the trot.'
But the news?'
'And the letters ?'
'And the papers?'
'Ah, bon Dieu! The news, and the letters, and the
papers! Here they are.' And Jean, having poured
the ruddy wine down his throat, placed himself in a
comical position on the high leaping-stock before the
door, unlocked his bag with much solemnity, and pro-
ceeded in a very easy and pleasant manner to make his
official' delivery.'
'Behold this little billet!' cried he, holding up an
immense letter. 'I am so proud and happy to carry
so handsome a billet that I know not how to part with
it! Indeed I would certainly keep it to myself were
it not directed to my dear M. Berion; but that it is
for him, and that I have the honour to bring it to him,
and to place it safely in his own hands, this completes
my happiness!' And with a Frenchman's bow, ex-
quisite in its easy courtesy, he handed the letter to an
individual standing among the now numerous group
which surrounded him. Voila, voila, voila! a little
note for Mue Julia Duréten. Duréten-Diable! who
is she?'
"
'Prenez garde, M. Jean! she is not so far away.'
Ah, it is well,' cried Jean, turning with ready tact
in the direction indicated by the looks of his auditory,
and raising his cap to a very pretty young peasant
woman. Ah, my friends, am I not blessed to have
brought so little a note so long a distance for so charm-
ing a demoiselle? What do I deserve? But, ah, I
am well rewarded!'-another most gallant bow to the
blushing Julia. 'Plus encore-here's for M. Fautillot.
Ah, monsieur, good tidings for you, I am sure; for
none would have the heart to send you bad by Jean
Babillon, who loves you so well! Here's for Annette
Perronet, the daughter of our noble host, who is, par
excellence, the inimitable and best possible Perronet. I
am proud to have brought it, mademoiselle! Here's
for Jules Gaitemps, a journal, the "National"-may it
delight his leisure! A "Débats" for Le Comte Beauvais.
O! am I not proud? A "Moniteur" for M. le Préfet.
Not here?' inquired Jean, looking round with an air
which provoked shouts of laughter, as if he expected to
see the comte and the préfet among his heterogeneous
audience. Then if people will not come to Jean, Jean
must go to them; but Jean is always happy amidst all
descriptions of comings and goings. A letter for André
Brunette, the younger. Happy youth! it is a maiden's

I'll be sworn.

'Haddington? It is for me!' exclaimed an elderly
individual, who had been standing at the door of the
little hostel, listening to the postman's gay rhodo-
montade with eager attention, and who now stepped
forward, and taking the letter, put a coin into Jean's
willing hand. He was an Englishman, and bore in
dress and mien the appearance of a man of business
upon his travels.
But how is this? It has been opened!'
'I have not opened it, monsieur,' said Jean, a little
vexed at the sharp tone of Mr Haddington. Perhaps
if monsieur will inspect the seal he will see that it is
all an accident-mere wear and tear of travel.'
Mr Haddington looked around, as if he wished no
one were present but himself and the postman; then
muttering Well, well,' with a dissatisfied air returned
into the house. Perronet watched him with some
curiosity. He opened the letter with a nervous and
anxious hand. After reading it he turned it about this
way and that, spread the sheet of paper wide, shook it,

looked on the ground; then taking up his hat, left the
house, and hurried down the road towards Eaux
Bonnes.
Jean, having delivered as many letters and papers
as he could at the door of the hostel, sat down to rest
awhile ere he proceeded on his travels with the remain-
der. Young and old gathered round the gay-hearted
fellow, laughing and chatting with him, and enjoying
an idle hour, as none know better how to do than the
peasantry of Southern France. Jokes aud laughter
brightened the atmosphere of the usually sober house
of Host Perronet, and never a man of the whole troop
had so merry a laugh as Jean Babillon.
But the evening was advancing: the postman had
no more time to spare. The white Navarre pony was
saddled and bridled, and off he went with a jest and a
song. He had not been gone many minutes when the
English traveller returned to the house. He asked
Perronet if the postman had left.
"Yes, monsieur, he is gone.'
'Does he return this way-and when?'
He returns to Pau to-morrow morning by this
way?

I must wait for him. The rascal has robbed me!'
'Robbed you, monsieur!' exclaimed Perronet with a
shrug of incredulity and surprise, not unmixed with
displeasure. It is not possible, monsieur; there is no
honester man in all France than Jean Babillon.'
Monsieur, the mayor of this department thinks
differently,' returned Mr Haddington coldly. At all
events I have lost an enclosure of considerable amount,
and shall not be able to proceed on my way to Madrid
till it is recovered or till I receive a further remittance.
A most annoying affair altogether! It must be in-
quired into rigorously or I shall not be contented.*
*Truly, monsieur, it is most annoying,' said Perronét,
raising his cap and rubbing his head ruefully. But
as for Jean Babillon, I will lay my life he is not to
blame. Pauvre garçon! it will break his heart.'
of sight with an inquiring look; the girls and women
eyed him with amazement; the very pigs and sheep
seemed to understand that he had done wrong, and was
no longer honest, welcome Jean Babillon. A bitter
time of it for Jean!
French jurisprudence is by no means so straight-
forward and rapid as English. Our neighbours are 80
discursive and so superficially profound in their inter-
rogatorics,' so wonderfully acute in minutiæ, that out
of every mole-hill they make a mountain; and when
here and there they come upon an actual mountain,
they straightway make a fire-and-sulphur volcano of it.
Inquiries were tuade at the Bureau des Postes at
Pau, where it was stated that a letter from England,
directed to Mr Haddington at Eaux Bonnes had been
duly received and handed to Jean Babillon for con-
veyance to its destination. The commis said he had
not taken particular notice, but believed--indeed would
not hesitate to swear-that the letter was properly
sealed when he placed it in the bag of the postman.
Then ensued the examination of Jean at the Hotel de
Ville. After the scanty evidence had been heard, Jenn
was at once sharply asked by M. Veronne, the mayor,
what had induced him to open the letter ?-why he hal
abstracted the enclosure ?what he had done with it?
&c., as it is the custom of French magistrates to do.
The suspected man carnestly declared his innocence:
he had not touched the letter from the moment it was
placed in his bag at Pau until he took it out and
delivered it to Mr Haddington at Eaux Bonnes. In
vain his protests. The mayor repeated his interroga-
tories with increased vehemence until Jean, contounded,
harassed, indignant, refused to answer or to say any-
thing at all. His passionate denials of guilt had been
made to criminate himself, and, now his silence was
declared to be evident proof of his inability to establish
his innocence. Mr Haddington was considerably an-
noyed at the manner in which the investigation was
conducted. The behaviour of the postman impressed
him with the belief that the suspicions he had enter-
tained were unfounded; but though he had experienced
no great difficulty in bringing the man to the bar, how
to get him away again was quite another matter. He
had rashly imagined that the interference of a magis-
trate would either procure him the restitution of the
property or a skilful investigation of the affair. When
poor Jean had been under the torture of a random
examination for upwards of an hour, and when Mr
Haddington, chafed and astonished at the manner in
which matters were conducted, would willingly, had
he been permitted, have abandoned the prosecution,
it occurred to the magistrate's notary that it was
possible the letter had never contained an enclosure:
there was no proof of the fact. Thereupon Mr Had-
dington was requested forthwith to write to England
for proof-Jean Babillon being remanded in the mean-
time.
As Jean returned the next morning he was arrested
by a commissary of police on a charge of having opened
a letter and abstracted a bank-bill. An examination
ensued before the authorities. Mr Haddington was
the agent of a London mercantile house, and was
intrusted with sundry negotiations at Bayonne, at
several of the Pyrenean towns, and at Madrid. He
had been waiting at Eaux Bonnes several days in
expectation of further instructions and a remittance,
preparatory to proceeding across the frontier into
Spain. At length Jean Babillon had brought him a
letter: it was enveloped in thin, tough, blue paper,
such as the firm he represented was in the habit of
using for enclosures. But the seal had been broken;
and though the writer of the letter stated that he
enclosed with it a bill for 6000 francs, no such docu-
ment was contained in the envelope. Mr Haddington,
ordinarily an impassible, thoroughly business-like
Englishman, had been rendered anxious and irritable As he issued from the Hôtel de Ville, Mr Hadding-
by expectation and delay; and smitten with an invo- ton, to his surprise, behield Perronet and a whole troop

the remittance. The placing him under arrest, how-much attached to their friend Jean, they had come up
ever, was a hasty and inconsiderate proceeding, and a
little reflection night have persuaded the traveller that
such a course was hazardous until inquiry had given
some sort of confirmation to his suspicions.
And now Jean Babillon travelled from Eaux Bonnes
to Pau as he had never travelled before; for though he
still bestrude his own little horse there was a gendarme
ou either side of him, and suspicion of crime weighed
heavily upon him, bowing his head and dimming the
brightness of his eye. He knew well every man and
woman they passed upon the familiar road; even the
very swine that grabbed about he knew one from the
other; and all, every one, appeared to perceive his
degradation. The men watched him till he was out

the officers descended from the justice-chamber, he wns

on hearing what he had to say, regarded the English-
man with shrugs and glances of anything but an
approbatory description. Now all this was deeply

and followed him, exclaiming, with tears of sorrow and
anger, that he had deprived her of her only means of
support. She was the mother of Jean. Mr Haddington,
in no very enviable frame of mind, instantly repaired
to the bureau of al merchant with whom he had, when
at Pau a short time previous, transacted some business,
and having explained to him how matters stood, suc-
ceeded in procuring a small loan. Having silenced the
clamours of the old lady by a liberal gratuity, he pro-

though almost anything is better than uncertainty and
unjust suspicion, the dénouement was of a deplorable
sort. The cashier of the house had never procured
the bills ordered to be sent to Mr Haddington. Instead
of so doing, he had drawn the stated amounts from the
bank, and put them into his own pocket, sending the
letters with fictitious or unfastened seals, in order, it
is supposed, to induce the belief that they had been
opened and plundered in transit. A matter of L.500,
however, was but a trifle in comparison to his other
defalcations. Having proceeded with extraordinary
adroitness to a point at which discovery became inevit-

your own refreshing dip; and you adjourn to your
machine, and get new life for the day by a prolonged
splashing in the deep, clear water, ever ten times more
agreeable on a shingle than on a sandy beach, because
you can drop at once from the machine into whatever
depth of water suits you, and always find it clean as
pump-water, and free from sand or other disagreeables.
Then after your bath you go home, and settle to some
quiet occupation for a few hours, again to sally forth
when the cool evening hours invite you to new enjoy-
ments by flood or fell.
Such was the course of life I was leading when,
after the heat of a September day, I set out for a
walk to the embankment which secures the low lands
at the mouth of the river Otter from the inroads of
the waters, the top of which forms a sort of terrace,
leading between the river and a stretch of salt marsh
to the pretty village of Otterton. There is here inte-
resting botanising ground, because, as the tide washes
the foot of the steep sloping wall which forms the side
of the embankment, many of those plants which love
saline positions are to be found there when the tide has
gone back. The jointed glasswort (Salicornia herbacea),
called by old Gerarde the flower of chrystalle,' was
one of the first which drew my attention. This is one of
the Chenopodea, of which order several species crowded
the embankment. The stem of the jointed glasswort
is erect, and divided by compressed, notched joints,
their intervals rather enlarged upwards: it is about a
foot high, bushy and green, with nearly cylindrical
branches; the spikes composed of numerous short
joints, each bearing three sessile flowers on two opposite
sides. Though common in England and Ireland, it is
not so in Scotland; but whether rare or common, its
singularity of appearance would lead to its attracting
notice from all passers. It is a valuable plant, yielding,
as do most of the salsolas and salicornias, an immense
quantity of soda, and consequently being largely em-
ployed in the manufacture both of glass and of barilla.
Some of the other Chenopodece which I found were
the mercury goosefoot (C. Bonus Henricus), which is a
sort of spinach, and sometimes eaten; the many-
clustered goosefoot (C. botryódes); stinking goosefoot
(C. ólidum), which exhales a detestable odour like stale
fish; also the wild beet (Beta maritima), and the
shrubby orach (Atriplex portulacoides), which is rather
a singular-looking shrub, and not very common, grow-
ing from one to two feet high, with lance-shaped leaves,
the whole plant mealy with small yellowish flowers.
The common - thrift (Statice armeria) or sea- pink
clusters on every rock and bank near the sea; but the
lavender-thrift or sea-lavender (S. limonium) which I
found on the wall of the embankment is far less com-
mon, and very brilliant and pretty. The státices belong
to the order Plumbaginea, and abound in salt marshes
in the temperate regions of the globe, especially in the
basin of the Mediterranean, in Southern Russia, and in
Affghanistan. The Koolah-i-Huzareh, which forms a
large part of the fuel of Cabul, consists of various
species of statice; few, however, are found within the
tropics. The lavender-thrift grows in panicles rather
curiously arched, and bearing a double row of bright
lavender-blue blossoms on one side the stalk. Though
so pretty, and in colour so like the sweet garden-thrift
or spick, as the west-country people call it, it is, how-
ever, but salt lavender which lacks perfume,' so that
it disappoints almost more than it pleases.
Rambling on, now resting on the flower-decked bank
watching the fish as they rise, and the eels wriggling
along on the surface of the water--sometimes descend-
ing the steep bank for a specimen to dry, or a pretty
flower to admire, then back to the wide terrace where
flowers and insects abound, I find here full amusement
--or creeping down on the land side to revel in the
gay vetches, &c. which brighten its herbage, I pursue
my way. But I must now speak a little of the
flower of greatest interest which I found near this spot,
and this was the sea-starwort (Aster tripolium), which
was now just beginning to bloom. It grows from two
to three feet high, and is very abundant; the stem is
round and smooth, as are the leaves, which are lance-
shaped, the lower ones being stalked, the upper nar-
rower and sessile; the flowers are large, purple, and
with a yellow disk, and grow in corymbs. The whole
plant has much the appearance of the Michaelmas-daisy
of the gardens. It forms one of that immense order
the composite, in which so many plants valuable in
medicine and otherwise are found. Plants of this
order are said to form a tenth part of the number of
all described plants:' half of those growing within the
tropics of America, as well as of those in Sicily and
the Balearic Isles, are of this formation. It is a singular
fact which Lindley states, that while in the northern
parts of the world composites are universally herbaceous
plants, they become gradually fruitescent, or even arbo-
rescent, as we approach the equator: most of those of
Chili are bushes, and the composites of St Helena are
mostly trees.' The structure of composites is so peculiar
and interesting that we cannot do better than enter a
little into a general description of it. Composites are
plants with a multitude of corollas collected into dense
heads on a common receptacle, and surrounded by an
involucre. The corolla is of one petal, either strap
or funnel-shaped; the stamens equal in number to
the teeth of the corolla, and alternate with them.
By the old Linnæan system the composites were
divided into three orders, defined by the sexes of the
florets. Those of the first order (Polygamia equalis)
contained all whose florets both of the disk and of the
circumference were perfect, having each five stamens
and one pistil, of which the thistles are examples;
the second order (Polygamia superflua) contained those
where the florets were all fertile, but those of the disk
furnished with five stamens and one pistil, and those
of the ray with a pistil only; as examples of which
arrangement we may instance the aster, daisy, mari-
gold, &c.; and the third order (Polygamia frustranea)
consisted of those where the florets of the disk were
perfect and fertile, and those of the circumference
devoid both of stamens and pistils, of which the knap-
weed is the sole British example. Now this arrange-
ment is declined by most modern botanists-though it
is still frequently adopted-and is superseded by the
following: Decandolle arranges them by the form of
the petals, and divides them into three sub-orders: the
first (Tubulifloræ) containing those which are tubular—
such as the asters, daisies, &c. with four or five teeth;
second sub-order (Labiateflore), those which have the
hermaphrodite florets, or at least the unisexual ones,
divided into two lips, of which the coltsfoot is an
example; and the third sub-order (the Liguliflora), those
whose corollas are slit or ligulate, as is the chicory. In
the first of these sub-orders are contained most of our
valuable plants: their characteristics seem to be-a bitter
matter combined with astringency; an acrid, resinous
substance, and some ethereal oil; and in some of the
species starch is contained in the roots, some being
tonics, others stimulants or astringents. Wormwoods,
southernwoods, and tansy, are among the tonic and
bitter medicinal plants of the first sub-order; and also
the camomile. A sort of eupatorium (E. glutinosum)
furnishes that most valuable styptic the matico leaf,
which, if wetted and placed on a cut or leech-bite,
or other wound which bleeds too profusely, seems to
act quite magically in stopping the bleeding. It is said
to have been discovered some years since by a soldier,
who, having been wounded in action, applied acciden-
tally the leaves of this shrub, which immediately
stopped the bleeding, and it has since been called
matico, in compliment to its discoverer, whose name was
Mateo-Matico being a nickname for 'Little Matthew.'
The second sub-order seems to be of little import; but

in the third we find the chicory (Chicórium in'tybus)
cultivated as a substitute for coffee; the dandelion or
dent-de-lion (Leon'todon taráxacum)—so important in
medicine; artichokes, lettuces, endive, succory, and
others of our kitchen-garden plants.

Some of the most brilliant and lasting ornaments
of our flower garden - the gorgeous dahlias, the chry-
santhemums, all the marigolds and asters, and great
numbers besides-are also composites. If the blossom

the aid of a microscope, it exhibits a most wonderful

or any blossom of this form a flower, for it is in
fact a head of flowers, composed of between 200 and
300 separate florets, each perfect in itself, and formed
of a corolla, stamens, and pistil. Every one of those
leaves which are white above and red underneath,'
says Rousseau, and form a kind of crown round the
flower, appearing to be nothing more than little petals,

you pull one out, you will find that the lower end is
round and hollow like a tube, and that a little forked
fibre, which is the style, issues from it. Then if you
examine one of the yellow florets which compose the
disk or centre, you will see that these are corollas of
one petal, in which you will perceive by the help of the
magnifier a pistil and anthers. These flowers expand
successively from the edge inwards. All these little
flowers, both white and yellow, are enclosed in a

supports them collectively, as the calyx does the petals

tube of the corollas are a few narrow, hairy scales,
which are in fact calices stunted in consequence of
growing among the closely-pressing florets. These are
called the pappas; and though often absent-as in the
daisy, the dandelion, and other plants-form that
beautiful plume of feathers which catch the wind, and
enable the seed to soar into the air and scatter itself
to a distance. The delicate feathery balls of the dan-
delion, which children amuse themselves with blowing
into the air, are the fruit of that plant crowned by the
pappas.' Such is a general sketch of composites, or as
they are commonly called, compound flowers.
But now my attention is attracted by something of
quite a different character; and flowers and botany are
for a time merged in watching a large bird of beautiful
plumage, which keeps hopping before me at a distance
of a few yards, and uttering a pretty and plaintive cry,
not as if frightened by my presence, but rather as if it
would allure me to follow it. Alas that the days of
talismans and amulets, and of beautiful damsels trans-
formed by some vile enchanter into the likeness of some
bird or beast, and waiting only for me to perform some
act which should restore them to their pristine form,
should be so wholly gone! I thought of the bird in the
'Arabian Nights,' which led the princess on and on, in
pursuit of the talisman of which it had deprived her,
till, step by step, it allured her far, far away; of
Thalaba's green bird; of everything which could work
on my imagination-but it would not do; and when the
pretty creature suddenly stopped, and even returned
to meet me, the organ of Wonder wholly yielded to the
deductions of causality, and I decided that it had been
in some way injured, and had become confused. It

sufferer. And here a word on nursing. Be assured
that it is quite a mistake for a nurse to confine herself
too closely to the house when she is in attendance
either on a confirmed invalid or on a convalescent.
There are of course cases of acute illness when it
would be unfit, almost impossible, to leave the patient
even for an hour; and in such emergencies everything
must yield to the exigencies of the moment.

patient may feel a little dull whilst his companion is
absent, but he is amply repaid by the greater spring
that is given to their intercourse on her return, from
the renewal of spirits and life that she has sustained,
and the fresh objects for discussion which she has
picked up in her rambles; whilst the nurse herself
feels brighter and more vigorous, and better able to
minister to the comfort or amusement of her com-
panion. Of course the ultimate results on her health
should also always be kept in view, for without such
assistance the health and spirits of any one who is
occupied in prolonged attendance on the sick must
sooner or later decay.
But
But to proceed. On the terrace I find many varie-
ties of trefoil, and among others that curious one the
subterranean trefoil (Trifolium subterráneum); it grows
very low (the stems, which are from three to six inches
long, pressing close to the ground), and presents never
more than three, or at the most four, white flowers on
each head. In the centre of each head is a stiff, strong
tuft of fibres, which embrace the joint. As the flowers
the ground, the stalk sending out from its extremity
which are at first erect mature, they turn towards
several fibres by which the head is dragged under the
ground, where the seed ripens.
I now left the bank of the river, and turning to
the left, entered a stretch of salt-marsh, on which
I found the salt-marsh club - rush (Schirpus maríti-
mus), and other rushes and sedges of interest; and
also in abundance that pretty little flower the sea
to eight inches high, erect and branched, its stem
milkwort (Glaux maritima), which grows from two
smooth and succulent with fleshy leaves and solitary
axillar flower of a pretty pink; and also the whorled
knot-grass (Illecebrum verticillútum), and various kinds
of persicaria, besides many other plants peculiar to such
localities; and then leaving the salt-marsh, retraced my
steps, finding as I went late blossoms of the English
scurvy-grass (Cochlearia Anglica), that sweet-scented
white flower, a species of which we find in cottage
a pretty plant, very much like the candy-tuft, and so
gardens in the spring under the name of 'honey blobs ;'
lusciously sweet as to collect the bees from all quarters
to the banquet it affords. On the stony slope of the
embankment I also found that pretty umbel the sea-
samphire (Crithmum maritimum), so called from crithe,
barley, which the fruit is supposed to resemble. This
are classed all plants whose flower-stems divide at the
plant is of the N. O. umbellifere, under which order

Lexclaimed aloud; but it really was so. It fairly swam
towards me, and came to land close to my feet, when it
suffered me to take it up, and lay it on some grass in
my parasol beside the poor dotterel. The solution of
this mystery was as simple as that of the cows. Some
clumsy, badeshot had been amusing himself with
poor creatures, and leaving them with broken bones and
torn flesh to 'drce penance, until starvation and suffer-
ing should put a close to that life which, but for the
young gentleman's gentle pastime, would have been a
life of joy and sunshine, spent in sporting among the
waves or soaring on buoyant, wing amid the sweet air
of heaven.

rays being terminated by a cluster of flowers, the stalks
of which also proceed from a common centre, and again
form an umbel, Parsley, carrot, and a multitude of
other important plants, all belong to this tribe. The
samphire grows about a foot high; the stem is round and
leafy; the leaves twice ternate; and the leaflets lance-popping at all the birds in his way just winging the
shaped, fleshy, and highly succulent-the whole plant
being of a pale-bluish green; and with its vigorous
growth and clear, sharp outline, forming a very pretty
ornament to the rocks where it grows. The flower is
white. Samphire is used as a pickle, and is of a salt
and aromatic flavour, and much more agreeable than
Salicornia herbacea, which I have before said is used
for the same purpose, forming a very fair substitute for
capers. It is sold by the peck, and considerably in
request in inland towns especially. Shakspeare's notice
of it shews that this plant has been in use for a long
period of years

of this is sold in the London and other markets; and

There is a field lying at the mouth of the river
which at spring-tide becomes very nearly if not quite
an island. On this field I had long wished to make a
raid; and finding it now accessible, I decided on visit
ing it; so leaving the limekilns to the right, I passed
over a narrow isthmus which connects it with the
mounds of shingle lying between it and the sea, and
soon found myself on the little promontory and nearly
surrounded by water. It is curious to see the cows
which are pastured in this field drinking freely of the
water which surrounds it, and which to all appearance
is sca-water, it being there only when the tide is in. I
have often heard this remarked on, and certainly at first
sight it is a puzzling circumstance, but ou a little con-
sideration the solution of the mystery is obvious, it being
simply this that the fresh water, of which a shallow
stream at all times flows, being specifically lighter than
the salt, floats on the surface till its body has been broken
up by the motion of the wayes, or other external causes;
and consequently the, cows, which seem to be imbibing
the briny fluid, are in fact getting a refreshing draught,
as if no saline particles lurked below. I was dis-flock.

surely I am not to have you too, you pretty creature!'
Ho afterwards comments on the singular fact, that

different species which associate with the purre and

birds for a long time together, the effect, especially in
stormy weather, being very singular as they flash on
the eye like a gleam of lightning when the white parts
of the whole party are presented all at once to the eye
and then totally disappear, the darker hue not being
noticeable from a distance.

Thus there is a view of Dunnottar Castle extremely
accurate, but not very picturesque; as, notwithstanding
the high rock on which it is raised, the castle buildings
are straggling and mean, and so Slezer represents them.
Beside his own work, however, he gives another, répre-
senting a prodigious mass of round and square towers,
very grand but by not mentis like the real buildings.
This was often the fashion in which representations of
castles were taken in that age, and for some time after-

actually afforded him specimens of such work; but that'
the honest Dutch captain disdained such flattering arts,
and boldly issued his own honest representation side by
side with its nurotricious rival. The whole work gives

his person, but arrested and attached his whole effects left to English statesmen, whose appreciation of his
wherever they could discover them.'
A document in the Advocates' Library, called 'The
Stated Case of Captain John Slezer, humbly represent-
ing what Remains due to him by the Publick,' makes
out a sum of L.2347 sterling as remaining unpaid in
the year 1708. This was no trifling sum in that day,
though great statesmen sometimes succeeded in obtain-
ing incomes of L.30,000 and even L.40,000 a year, by
what would now be accounted peculation. He gives a
pathetic account of his sufferings from his creditors,
who became so impatient for their money, and pur-
sued me so hard for it, that I was necessitate to betake
myself to the sanctuary of Holyrood House, wherein I
have continued these thirteen years bypast confined, to
my almost utter ruin, being, amongst other hardships,
obliged in a manner to double charges, by maintaining
a numerous family in town and myself at no small
charge within the sanctuary; and my zeal not to let
my company want any necessaries did induce me rather
to engage personally for whatever they stood in need
of, than to suffer them to go naked, which falls very
heavy upon me. For I am decreed by the lords of
council and sessin to pay not only ten or twelve
years' interest for what I stand engaged for to serve
the public, but I am likewise obliged to pay every
man's charges of lawsuits in pursuing for what I
owed him.' It appears that Slezer died in 1714, and
that his claims were to the last unsettled by the British
government, which had succeeded to the obligations
incurred by that of Scotland.
The documents through which we trace the unfortu-
nate history of Slezer contain that of two other fellow-
sufferers in the public service: the one was John
Adair, a geographer, employed at the instance of the
Scottish parliament, with the same fallacious reward of
a tonnage, to furnish charts and maps of the Scottish
coast; the other was Alexander Nisbet, a herald,
engaged in the now rather despised, but at that time
highly esteemed, task of preparing a system of heraldry
applicable to the chief families of Scotland. The
history of both is so similar to that of Slezer that it
would be needless to detail it.
The other ill-requited intellectual workman whose
melancholy history we have to notice is James Ander-
son, the author of the magnificent book called 'Diplo-
mata et Numismata Scotia'-(The Charters and Coins
of Scotland.') Just before the Union a man named
Atwood had written a book, intended to prove that, of
old, Scotland was a feudal dependency of England. If
he desired to produce the most frantic national irrita-
tion he could not have devised a more effective means.
All Scotland was in a blaze, and had Atwood ventured
across the Border, he would not have left the country
alive. It was better, however, to meet him with the
pen than with the sword, and at the proper moment
Anderson started up, who, with much more learning
than Atwood possessed, attacked him in a 'Historical
Essay shewing that the Crown and Kingdom of Scot-
land is Imperial and Independent.' He addressed a
willing audience, and his arguments were received with
overwhelming enthusiasm. The country seemed only
anxious to know what their champion desired as his
reward to offer it without delay.
Anderson had in view a favourite project-the
publication of copper-plate fac-similes of the most
remarkable ancient documents extant in Scotland, along
with representations of Scottish coins and medals. The
Scottish parliament, however, did not remain in exist-
ence long enough to complete a transaction with him.
They gave him an instalment of L.300, and in their
very latest proceedings recommended him to her majesty
as a person who should not only be supported in the
execution of his great work, but as a person meriting
her gracious favour in conferring any office of trust
upon him.' But the fulfilment of these promises was
services was very different from that entertained by his
own countrymen. After the Union he went to London,
where he had two great objects in view the one, to
get his engravings made; the other, to keep up an
assiduous attendance on the courtiers who might have
influence enough to procure him his expected reward—
for in those days nothing was got for public services
without interest, and many a man made his fortune on
the public money through interest who had never done
any service whatever. Harley, Lord Oxford, the prime
minister, kept perpetually round him a sad group of
expectants, who courted his lackeys, and wasted precious
time in his ante-rooms. They had the more hope from
him, as he was a man of letters, a collector of books
and pictures, and a patron of men of genius. A country-
man of Anderson-Lockhart of Carnwath-in his
memoirs, said that the queen herself was interested in
Anderson, and 'took great pleasure in seeing the fine
seals and charters of the ancient records he collected,”
and that she told my Lord Oxford she desired some-
thing might be done for him. To all which his lord-
ship's usual answer was-that there was no need of
pressing him to take care of that gentleman, for he was
the man he designed, out of regard to his great know-
ledge, to distinguish in a particular manner.' But Oxford
was notorious for neglecting such promises. When free
from the cares of business, he was generally in a state
of hazy, partial intoxication; and he considered, or
pretended to consider, all the hungry expectants as so
many friendly fellows who courted his society because
they enjoyed it as he did theirs.
The cross purposes thus occasioned were sometimes
sufficiently ludicrous, as the reader may see in the
following extract from Lockhart :- He introduces the
victim as an English gentleman whose name I've
forgot, very much noticed for his wit and poetry;' but
it is understood that the person whose name the
Jacobite politician could not remember was Prior the
poet. 'Being introduced,' continues Lockhart, to
the Lord Oxford, he asked him if he understood
Spanish. The gentleman replied: No; but that in
a little time he could soon be master of it in such a
degree as to qualify him to serve in any station
where his lordship thought fit to employ him; and
away he went, and employed six or seven months in
the close study of that language, and having acquired
what he thought necessary- -not doubting but he
might be employed on some business abroad, which
he most desired-he waited on his lordship, and told
him that now he believed he understood the Spanish
language tolerably well. "Well, then," replied my lord,
you'll have the pleasure of reading 'Don Quixote' in
the original, and 'tis the finest book in the world;" which
was all that gentleman got for his long attendance and
hard study!'-(Lockhart Papers, i. 372.) The result of
Anderson's efforts was as unsubstantial if not as ludi-
crous. Oxford told him that no doubt he had heard
that in his fine library he had a collection of the
pictures of the learned both ancient and modern, and
as he knew none who better deserved a place there than
Mr Anderson, he desired the favour of his picture.'
Mr Anderson complied, and so ended all transactions
between them. The expectants used afterwards to be
jocular with each other about getting places in the
treasurer's library.

Yet in that garden of weeds grew up one stately
plant of good fruit; for the disappointed man seems never
to have become utterly disheartened, and he went on
steadily with his magnificent work. His miscellaneous
papers in the Advocates' Library are full of complaints
and histories of defeated efforts, but they indicate that
he was ever at work and full of hope. At times when
he could not go on with his great work, which involved
not only labour but great expense, he made historical
researches in other quarters, and published four quarto

volumes of 'Collections Relating to the History of Mary
Queen of Scotland.' He had gathered a valuable
library, and he endeavoured to raise a fund for carry-
ing on his work by selling it to George II., but the
negotiation failed. At the age of sixty-six, with his
work nearly completed through all his difficulties, he
found himself compelled to pawn the copper-plates for
bread. He died a few months afterwards, in 1728, and
after his death the plates when sold by auction brought
L.530. Luckily they were not lost to the world. A
patriotic feeling was resuscitated in Scotland when his
melancholy history was at an end, and the magnificent
work so well known to all antiquaries was published
with an introduction by the learned Ruddiman. It is
a book only to be found in great libraries, and a copy
of it, even in tolerable order, can seldom be obtained for
less than ten guineas.
It is a sad conclusion of these melancholy notices to
observe that Slezer and Anderson, after having been
friends in early life, appear to have bitterly quarrelled,
and conducted lawsuits with each other. Some docu-
ments connected with pecuniary claims maintained by
Anderson against Slezer will be found in a collection
called Analecta Scotica.' In the same book there is a
curious and more interesting correspondence between
Anderson and Sir Richard Steel,
THE WIDOW OF COLOGNE.
IN the year 1641 there lived in a narrow, obscure street
of Cologne a poor woman named Marie Marianni.
With an old female servant for her sole companion, she
inhabited a small, tumble-down, two-storeyed house,
which had but two windows in front. Nothing could
well be more miserable than the furniture of this dark
dwelling. Two worm-eaten four-post bedsteads, a
large deal-press, two rickety tables, three or four old
wooden chairs, and a few rusty kitchen utensils, formed
the whole of its domestic inventory.
Marie Marianni, despite the wrinkles which nearly
seventy years had left on her face, still preserved the
trace of former beauty. There was a grace in her
appearance, and a dignity in her manner, which pre-
possessed strangers in her favour whenever they hap-
pened to meet her; but this was rarely. Living in the
strictest retirement, and avoiding as much as possible
all intercourse with her neighbours, she seldom went
out except for the purpose of buying provisions. Her
income consisted of a small pension, which she received
every six months. In the street where she lived, she
was known by the name of The Old Nun,' and was
regarded with considerable respect.
Marie Marianni usually lived in the room on the
ground-floor, where she spent her time in needlework;
and her old servant Bridget occupied the upper room,
which served as a kitchen, and employed herself in
spinning.
Thus lived these two old women in a state of com-
plete isolation. In winter, however, in order to avoid
the expense of keeping up two fires, Marie Marianni
used to call down her domestic, and cause her to place
her wheel in the chimney-corner, while she herself
occupied a large old easy-chair at the opposite side.
They would sometimes sit thus evening after evening
without exchanging a single word.
One night, however, the mistress happened to be in
a more communicative temper than usual, and address-
ing her servant, she said: 'Well, Bridget, have you
heard from your son?'
'No, madame, although the Frankfort post has come
in.'
'You see, Bridget, it is folly to reckon on the affec-
tion of one's children; you are not the only mother who
has to complain of their ingratitude.'
'But, madame, my Joseph is not ungrateful: he loves
me, and if he has not written now, I am certain it is
only because he has nothing to say. One must not be
too hard upon young people.'
'Not too hard, certainly; but we have a right to their
submission and respect.'
'For my part, dear lady, I am satisfied with possess-
ing, as I do, my son's affection.'
'I congratulate you, Bridget,' said her mistress with
a deep sigh. 'Alas! I am also a mother, and I ought
to be a happy one. Three sons, possessing rank, for-
tune, glory; yet here I am, forgotten by them, in
poverty, and considered importunate if I appeal to them
for help. You are happy, Bridget, in having an obedient
son-mine are hard and thankless!'
'Poor, dear lady, my Joseph loves me so fondly!'
'You cut me to the heart, Bridget: you little know
what I have suffered. An unhappy mother, I have
also been a wretched wife. After having lived
unhappily together during several years, my husband
died, the victim of an assassin. And whom, think you,
did they accuse of instigating his murder? Me! In
the presence of my children-ay, at the instance of my
eldest son-I was prosecuted for this crime!'
'But doubtless, madame, you were acquitted?'
'Yes; and had I been a poor woman, without power,
rank, or influence, my innocence would have been
publicly declared. But having all these advantages, it
suited. my enemies' purpose to deprive me of them, so
they banished me, and left me in the state in which I
am!'
'Dear mistress!' said the old woman.
Marie Marianni hid her face in her handkerchief, and
spoke no more during the remainder of the evening,
As the servant continued silently to turn her whcel,
she revolved in her mind several circumstances con-
nected with the Old Nun.' She had often surprised
her reading parchments covered with seals of red
wax, which, on Bridget's entrance, her mistress always
hurriedly replaced in a small iron box.
One night Marie Marianni, while suffering from an
attack of fever, cried out in a tone of unutterable
horror: No: I will not see him! Take away yon red
robe--that man of blood and murder!'
These things troubled the simple mind of poor
Bridget, yet she dared not speak of them to her usually
haughty and reserved mistress.
On the next evening, as they were sitting silently at
work, a knock was heard at the door.
"Who can it be at this hour?' said Marie Marianni.
'I cannot think,' replied her servant; "is now
nine o'clock.'
'Another knock! Go, Bridget, and see who it is,
but open the door with precaution.'
The servant took their solitary lamp in her hand, and
went to the door. She presently returned, ushering
into the room Father Francis, a priest who lived in the
city. He was a man of about fifty years old, whose
hollow cheeks, sharp features, and piercing eyes wore
a sinister and far from hallowed expression.
"To what, father, am I indebted for this late visit?'
asked the old lady.
"To important tidings,' replied the priest, which I
am come to communicate.'
'Leave us, Bridget,' said her mistress. The servant
took an old iron lamp, and went up stairs to her fire-
less chamber.
What have you to tell me?' asked Marie Marianni
of her visitor.
'I have had news from France.'
'Good news?'
'Some which may eventually prove so.'
"The stars, then, have not deceived me!'
'What, madame!' said the priest in a reproving
tone; 'do you attach any credit to this lying astrology?
Believe me, it is a temptation of Satan which you
ought to resist. Have you not enough of real misfor-
tune without subjecting yourself to imaginary terrors?'

If it be a weakness, father, it is one which I share
in common with many great minds. Who can doubt
the influence which the celestial bodies have on things
terrestrial?'
All vanity and error, daughter.
How can an
enlightened mind like yours persuade itself that
events happen by aught save the will of God?'
I will not now argue the point, father; tell me rather
what are the news from Francé?"
The nobles' discontent at the prime minister has
reached its height. Henri d'Effiat, grand-equerry of
France, and the king's favourite, has joined them, and
drawn into the plot the Duke de Bouillon, and Monsieur,
his majesty's brother. A treaty, which is upon the
point of being secretly concluded
uded with the king of
Spain, has for its object peace, on condition of the
cardinal's removal.
Thank God!'

However, madame, let us not be too confident; con-
tinue to act with prudence, and assume the appearance
of perfect resignation. Frequent the church in which
I minister, place yourself near the lower corner of the
right-hand aisle, and I will forewarn you of my next
visit,'
'I will do so, father?
Resuming his large cloak, the priest departed, Bridget
being summoned by her mistress to open the door.
From that time, during several months, the old lady
repaired regularly each day to the church; she often saw
Father Francis, but he never spoke, or gave her the
desired signal, The unaccustomed daily exercise of
walking to and from church, together with the 'sickness
of hope deferred,' began to tell unfavourably on her
health; she became subject to attacks of intermitting
fever, and her large, bright eyes seemed each day to
grow larger and brighter. One morning, in passing
down the aisle, Father Francis for a moment bent, his
head towards her, and whispered; All is lost!'
With a powerful effort Marie Marianni subdued all
outward signs of the terrible emotion which these words
caused her, and returned to her cheerless dwelling.
In the evening Father Francis came to her. When they
were alone, she asked: Father, what has happened?",
'Monsieur de Cing-Mars is arrested."
And the Duke de Bouillon?"
'Fled,'
"The treaty with the king of Spain ?'
'I'

;
Monsieur the Duke of Orleans; Henrietta of France,
queen of England.".
And what,' asked the astounded magistrate, was
the name of the deceased?"
The High and Mighty Princess Marie de Medicis,
widow of Henri IV., and mother of the reigning king!
BILLINGSGATE.
Nor one of the well-nigh innumerable branches of
industry which from dawn to eye, and partially through
the night, employ the scheming brains and busy hands
of the people of this country, has derived greater pro-
portional advantages from the invention of steam-ships,
steam-horses, and railroads, than the fisher's craft
and commerce. Till within a few years nothing could
be, more precarious and lottery-like than the trade in
fresh fish. A vast take, from the impossibility of dis-
tributing it with sufficient celerity through the country,
was but of slight benefit to the fishermen, and cart-
loads of choice and delicate food were in consequence
disposed of at a merely nominal sum, which, in the inland
counties especially, would have realised high prices, and
thrown as manure upon lands adjacent to the const.
Even London, with its Maelström power of attracting all
requisite supplies, was often nearly destitute of fish for
many days together, whilst abundance of the perish-
able article was kept back by calms or adverse winds.
Steam has happily changed all this; and now not only
Kent, Sussex, and the nearer maritime counties despatch
their sea-produce with certainty and speed to the great
metropolitan fishmarket, but the more distant ports of
Devon, Yorkshire, Aberdeen, Leith, and others help to
swell the immense and continuous supply feeding that
great centre of the trade, which, after absorbing sufficient
for its own needs, distributes the residue by innumer
able diverging channels throughout the kingdom.
Billingsgate Market, with its adjuncts, is unquestion-
ably the vigorously pulsating heart through and by
which the finny treasures of the deep are propelled to
the inland counties of England, and the Exchange which
tests and regulates fish-values and supplies in every
town and village of Great Britain. And, at first view,
what an unpromising site and building for the seat of
such an agency! The material aspect of the place is
chiefly made up of a mean-looking shed, sheltering a
confined piece of ground which abuts by a few rough,

house, and furnished with wooden stalls or benchies
of by no means an inviting or expensive description.
There are many country fishmarkets that for size, con-
venience, cleanliness, and fittings-up, might put Billings-
sub-gate to the blush-supposing Billingsgate to be capable
of blushing, a point upon which we offer no opinion.
But the spirit, the energy, the commercial sagacity, the
vast capital daily and hourly brought into play and
developed there, have no comparison or rival in any
similar establishment in the world. The market was
established in 1699, and during the century and a half
which have since passed by, so large a proportion of the
produce of the fisheries of Great Britain has been
heaped up and disposed of beneath that paltry wooden
shed, as to require, previous to the facilities afforded
by railways, nearly 3000 vessels annually to bring it
there. The supply is immensely more abundant now
than then, as well as equable and constantly progres-
sive; but fewer vessels ascend the Thames to Billings-
That same night the poor old woman was seized
with a burning fever. In her delirium the phantom-
man in red still pursued her, and her ravings were
terrible to hear. Bridget, seated at her bedside, prayed
for her; and at the end of a month she began slowly to
recover. Borne down, however, by years, poverty, and
misfortune, Marie Marianni felt that her end was ap-
proaching. Despite Father Francis's dissuasion, she
again had recourse to the astrological tablets, on which
were drawn, in black and red figures, the various
houses of the sun, and of the star which presided over
her nativity. On this occasion their omens were
unfavourable; and rejecting all spiritual consolation-
miserable in the present, and hopeless for the future-gate, the great mass of the fish being brought in vang by
Marie Mariami, expired in the beginning of July 1642.
As soon as her death was known a magistrate of
Cologne came to her house, in order to make an official
entry of the names of the defunct and her heirs.
Bridget could not tell either, she merely knew that
her late mistress was a stranger.
Father Francis arrived. I can tell you the names
of her heirs,' he said. Write-the king of France;

the confined, dingy shed, rude wooden benches, sloppy
pavement, and narrow passages assume colossal dimen-
sions and a quite brilliant aspect; and the confused
din and unintelligible gabble which usually accompany
the early morning sales, relieve and heightened at
occasional intervals by the entirely comprehensible
and very energetic interchange of compliments which

is on the surface merely. Let but a slight collision
between rival, venders of the lower grades occur, and it
is wonderful how quickly the varnish peals off, and
reveals the gnarled and knotty traditional grain under-
peath in all its pristine beauty, vigour, and originality

But the scent of the roses will cling round it still!'
The shell of old Billingsgate, the wooden, erection-
that is, beneath which the fishy traffic has been for so
many years carried on will soon disappear, and its
place be supplied by the new brick-and-stone building
now in rapid progress; but the genius of the place will,
we nothing doubt, survive in the new structure, and
receive oblations of the old cloquence for many years to
come.
11
The market is, however, a sight to see, and a brief
guide to its mysteries may not be without its use to
some amongst the numerous curiosity-hunters who now
throng the streets of London.
It commences throughout the year at five o'clock in
the morning-formerly the hour in summer was four
and the wholesale distribution of the arrivals by the
salesmen amongst competing fish tradesmen, bunima-
rees (persons who keep retail stands in the market), and
costermongers, is mainly concluded by eight. We say
mainly concluded, for should a consignment arrive, at
any hour of the day, the salesman to whom it is
addressed instantly clears his stalt, mounts his tub-
rostrum, and with loud outeries, intelligible to the
initiated only, gathers round him a motley group, who
purchase, pay for, and carry off the fish with a readiness
and despatch marvellous to persons accustomed to the
bargaining and haggling indulged in between buyers
and sellers where time is not esteemed so precious as
in this hurrying, breathless metropolis of England.

and filth, and darkness, that many London fortunes
are scraped together. That middle-aged man just
passed, whose keen eyes scanned so sharply the size and
appearance of the salmon he was extricating from a
raked out of the black Californian hole in which he is
hamper, is said to be worth L.70,000 or 1.80,000, all
now eagerly toiling. Emerging from Love Lane we
come direct upon Dark House Lane - an ominous
ending, for beyond is the river! and suggestive, that
Cockney-street nomenclature may have deeper mean-
ings than is usually supposed, Dark-House Lane is
substantially a portion of the market; but instead of
passing in that way, let us turn slightly to the left, and
enter by the front, where a long line of fish-loaded vans
are already crowding up. Business has begun with a
vengeance. 'Leith - Leith!" York York!'.
Kent-Kent !'-'Barton-Barton!" shout the zealous
aides to the salesmen, discordantly proclaiming, the
counties and ports from which the multitudinous
consignments of fish are pouring swiftly in. Many of
these aides are shore-men-rough, unlicked bipeds,
who are chiefly employed in bringing up fish from the
vessels in the river, and of whom it is necessary to
keep clear, as they push along with heavy baskets
on their heads or shoulders, and having slapped
down the contents on the stand of the salesman by
whom they are employed, hurry off for a fresh load,
quite certain that, quick as they may be, they shall
find the saleboard empty when they return. Others
are the Fellowship Porters, who more affect the vans,
and assist in supplying the salesmen, some dozen of
whom you may observe seated upon tubs or other
convenient substratum, and loudly and fiercely con-
mending in the strangest dialect their commodities to
the notice of undecided purchasers. These salesmen
are all respectable, and many of them wealthy men.
One, who has but recently retired from active business
6
a Mr Stewart-is said to have realised during forty
or fifty years industry in this vocation the almost
incredible sum of L.250,000; and a junior partner still
carries on the profitable business. Almost all of them
have a lidded pewter-mug either in their hands or
beside them, from which in the intervals of exertion
they imbibe a restorative, said to consist invariably of
coffee. If this be so, which we have no right to doubt,
it is, we have noticed in several instances, coffee of a
kind emitting a more pungent and spirituous odour
than any variety of the berry with which we are
acquainted.
These gentlemen exhibit a hereditary
aptitude for the satisfactory disposal of fish, which it
is confidently asserted is to be found only in those
who have imbibed the traditions of Billingsgate from
infancy. The utter failure of Hungerford Market,
established in 1831, as a western and genteel rival to the
ancient fish-mart, is partly attributed to the inefficiency
of the newfangled system of sale adopted there, and
the inexperience of the wholesale venders. We have
Setting out, then, at a few minutes before five o'clock
from a near point-say from Leadenhall Street, an
easily discoverable locality-we are enabled to mark
the phases of Billingsgate progress from the starting-
point. Let it be Friday, which is the best morning
that can be chosen for the visit; for although there is a
crowded market every day, this is always-since Steam
yoked Time, and thereby took the matter out of the
hands of Chance—the most profusely - supplied and
numerously-attended, owing to the increased demand
by Roman Catholics, Jews, and others, with whom
Friday is a fish or fast-day. Turning down Leaden-written
hall Place on the right, looking towards the east, we
pass by the sheds of the Skin Market, where, on every
Tuesday and Friday in the year, the raw, but scarcely
at this time of the year fresh hides of some 5000 or
6000 beasts, slain within a mile of where we are stand-
ing, are exposed for sale. Passing on to the left we
reach Lime Street, which opens into East Cheap; and
right over the way is Love Lane, an offshoot and direct
approach to central Billing gate.,
You must be careful of yourself in Love Laue. Its
course runs anything but smooth, and it was no doubt
on account of its tortuous, stumbling slipperiness that
it received its name. The only Cupids nestling here
to my knowledge are those busy gentlemen in the
dingy cellars, right and left, sorting by the flaring gas-
light baskets of fish-already arrived by direct con-
signment for transmission to their numerous country
customers. It is in such places as these, amid stenchi,

weekly rent of a stall, somewhere about 8s., paid to
the city, is a merely nominal charge relatively to its
value, and for a new man to obtain one is said to be next
to an impossibility. Stalls, in both this and Leadenhall
Market, are a kind of heirloom, with this distinction,
that they cannot be underlet-not openly or ostensibly
underlet of course we mean, for the actual underletting,
at enormously-advanced rents, is a matter of notoriety
unsusceptible as it may be of legal proof.
And yet there really does not appear to be any
inscrutable mystery, any very refined art in the sale-
process, except indeed with respect to the language
sometimes employed, without a key to which, simple
enough when known, it is a gabble incomprehensible
by the most accomplished linguist. Let us pause an
instant before the respectable young gentleman with

carefully trained moustaches, seated patiently and
indifferently upon a herring-tub. A Fellowship Porter
pitches down before him a basket from York, out of
which tumble fifty or sixty soles and half a dozen
turbot. A shoreman, a minute afterwards, deposits, a
little apart from the flat '-fish, a double (two-score) of
Nancys (lobsters); some double Nancys-that is, very
fine specimens; some 'cripples,' or one-clawed indi-
viduals of this species of crustacea. The mode of sale
is a sort of cross between the ordinary chaffering and
abating of private sales, and, if customers are nume-
rous round the stall, of biddings by auction. The
moustached young gentleman, after glancing at the
book he holds in his left hand-the right is monopolised
by a cigar-addresses something sotto voce to an ex-
perienced buyer who has been examining the lot. The
buyer-expectant thereupon stretches himself over to-
wards the salesman, and whispers, with his hand over
his mouth, a by no means satisfactory communication in
the ear of the vender, judging by the shake of the head
and the renewed pull at the pewter which follow. A
louder appeal to the liberality of the bystanders is now
made; and if strangers are present apparently desirous
of becoming customers, something like the following
unintelligible gabble will go on, in reply to the demand
of the salesman of what the company will say to his
fine lot of York: '-
Eno dunop,' replies the dealer who made the first
private but abortive offer.
Eno dunop and a flah,' says a new bidder.
'A noc more,' adds a competitor; and the lot is his
for L.1, 158.
This dialect, now chiefly confined to Billingsgate
Market, and slowly falling into disuse even there, was
not long since common enough amongst several classes
of sharp metropolitan traders, desirous of concealing
their operations from denizens of the outer world, who
might chance to be standing or sitting near. It is a
very simple expedient-merely the pronunciation of the
words as nearly as may be backwards. Thus 'eno' is
one; 'owt,' two; 'dunop,' a pound; 'flah,' half; 'noc,'a
crown; and so on. Habit enables dealers in this market
to speak and comprehend each other in this way with
great facility; and it is of course impossible, when this
local lingo is adopted, for a stranger to follow the
biddings, or take an effective part in what is going on.
The practice is, however, falling into disuse as well as
disrepute the practical exclusion of provincial or
private buyers from these sales has been almost gene-
rally abandoned, and many salesmen will even permit
a non-dealer to select a single turbot or other small
quantity of fish from the lot about to be disposed of to
the trade. This last practice gives, naturally enough,
great offence to retail dealers; but the competition
amongst the salesmen themselves, and the ingenious
mode adopted by consigners to ascertain which amongst
these agents are most successful in realising good prices,
leave them no option if they would retain a profitable
commission. Many persons who send fish to Billings-
gate often divide it carefully as to quantity and quality
into a number of equal parcels, and forward them to
different salesmen, and the returns of course at once
detect the bungler or the knave, should there be one, in
the profession. Here, as everywhere else in these fast
times, activity, skill, and honesty, soon push sloth,
incapacity, or knavery from their stools, hereditarily-
acquired seats though they may be.
The trampling and hurrying to and fro, the cries and
shoutings, continue to increase as each new arrival in
van or vessel pours a fresh supply into the thronging
and eager arena; and hark! a new element of uproar
suddenly increases the din of voices: 'Yowler!' 'yowler!'
'yowler!' bursts from half a hundred throats, and
there is an immediate rush of gentlemen with unmistak-
able physiognomies towards the auction-stands. It is
Friday: yowler' means halibut, a favourite fish in
Jewish families, and hence the increased eagerness of
competition. The yowlers or halibuts speedily vanish,
and now six o'clock strikes, and the oyster trade starts
instantly into vigorous life. The varied perfections of
Whitstable Natives and Commons; Old Royal Scotch
Callies and Commons; Old Milton Royal Natives,
Commons, Callies, and Pearls, are loudly and persist-
ently proclaimed, and set forth not only by the most
sweet voices of the market, but, in accordance with
law, on black boards with white letters, fastened to the
rigging of the oyster vessels at the foot of yonder broad
flight of steps, up which shorers, porters, and coster-
mongers are hurrying with their loads as fast as the
holdsmen can supply their demands. A curious instance
of the power of custom to countenance and enforce a
manifest imposition spite of authoritative efforts to
put it down, is afforded by the impudent persistence
of these holdsmen, or measurers and shovellers of
the oysters, in extorting 4d. per bushel from pur-
chasers for serving the oysters, in defiance of half a
dozen large boards signed Merewether, warning the
public in large-sized letters that such a demand is
illegal, and must not be complied with. The buyers
find, it seems, that it is essential to their interest to pay
the fee as a gift, as otherwise their business would be
hindered, and themselves exposed to incessant annoy-
ance from the holdsmen confederacy; and the result is,
that the charge is as regularly paid as if the corporation
notices enforced compliance with instead of resistance
to the imposition.
The bustle at last begins gradually to subside.
Private purchasers-elderly gentlemen very frequently
of limited means and delicate palates, who, to secure a
cheap and dainty tidbit, have ventured out at so early
an hour-some time since threaded their way cautiously
out of the market, momently becoming more and more
sloppy, slushy, and slippery; the regular traders have
slowly followed their example; the salesmen dismount
and go their several ways; and by eight o'clock or there-
away little remains to notice beyond the ordinary
appearances of an abundantly - supplied retail fish-
market of no very great extent. On the east side
mussels and winkles are heaped up in black and
strongly-odorous receptacles, and watched and served
by attendant sprites of scarcely perceptible difference
in colour or perfume. In front are ranged huge piles
of shrimps and prawns; and, strange to say, the dealers
in these, one would suppose, comparatively insignificant
articles, are amongst the wealthiest of fish-merchants!
On the western side, and in Dark-House Lane, which
adjoins and communicates with the market, are nume-
rous shop-stalls, coffee-houses, and taverns, in several
of which last-named places of resort a good fish-dinner.
may be had at twelve o'clock-as numerous touters
inexorably iterate for the very moderate charge of
one shilling. All these places are the property of the
city, and help to swell the enormous income which
sustains the pride and pageantry of the Guildhall and
Mansion-House.

The vast development which the fish-trade has taken
has, it appears, been greatly stimulated by the abolition
of the duties formerly levied on various kinds of fish
imported by foreigners. The fisher-mind of Great
Britain has within these last few years cast off the
lethargy which once, partially at least, characterised it;
and under the bracing influence of emulative rivalry,
and sustained, it is true, by greatly superior capital, is
rapidly distancing other nations in the race.
salmon, for instance, which a year or two ago was
brought to Billingsgate in large quantities, is now
driven out of the market by the produce of the Scotch
fisheries. It is the same with turbot and other valuable
varieties, the greatly-increased supply of which is now
almost exclusively obtained from British fishermen.

herring fisheries, are additional evidences of the vast
capital, energy, and labour, now employed in rendering
the exhaustless resources of the deep available for the
sustenance of man; and well would it be for Ireland
if the inhabitants of her extensive line of coast could
only be induced to apply themselves earnestly to the
work of reaping the prolific sea-fields which encompass
that island.
Let us not, however, forget that in addition to
steam, railways, maritime skill and activity, and
judiciously-directed capital, there is another valuable,
though humble agency which has greatly aided, and is
greatly aiding, the increase of the commerce in fish:
we mean the costermongers. It is a fact, variously
accounted for, but still an unquestionable fact, that the
poorer classes in this country, in our large towns
especially, are not willingly fish-eaters, and that even
in times of great dearness and scarcity in other articles
of food they have seldom had recourse to fish, however
cheap or abundant. Billingsgate Market, the numerous
offshoots in its vicinity, with the shops sparsely scattered
over the metropolis, could do little towards overcoming
this absurd repugnance. To the costermongers alone,
who in their lowly but useful calling knock at the poor
man's door, and tempt the half- reluctant housewife
with the actual sight of a cheap and abundant meal,
obtainable without trouble, which in nine cases out of
ten would not have been taken, we almost entirely owe
it that the foolish prejudice is slowly but surely dis-
appearing. Hundreds of these petty dealers may be
seen every morning at Billingsgate bidding for a score
of lobsters, a basket of soles and plaice, or wrangling
with the holdsmen about the illegal twopence claimed
for shovelling the half-bushel of oysters, upon the suc-
cessful disposal of which the maintenance of a family,
and the means of procuring a renewed supply on the
morrow, entirely depend. The great majority of these
traders are industrious, honest, and spite of old saws,
quiet and civil folk. There are of course many excep-
tions, as certainly as there are degrees of station and
opulence amongst them. The lowest in the scale carry
their stock in trade on their backs; the middle class
possess barrows; whilst those who have attained to the
dignity of a donkey are admitted at the head of their
order. They have also the Billingsgate variety at
least have their illustrations and eccentricities; men
who give the lie to Gray's lamentation that chill
penury' can repress the noble rage' or 'freeze the
genial current' of fiery and ambitious souls. One of
them is now walking out of the market: a short, stout
man, with a basket of fish on his back. In his younger
days he served his country in the royal navy; at past
forty years of age he manfully set himself to acquire
the arts of reading and writing, and has since devoted
what time he could spare to the study of political
eloquence and economy. He has strong opinions
upon free trade and native industry; and I have
myself heard him at large meetings dispose of the most
complex questions in commercial and constitutional
science amidst tornadoes of applause. He is, in short,
one of the rather numerous class of persons who could
at any time beat parliament and give 'em six.' He
claims to be at the top of his class-a pre-eminence, by
the way, somewhat endangered by a younger man, who
chiefly affects shrimps for his peripatetic commerce.
This gentleman about three years ago suddenly started
as a candidate for Downing Street, and but for his
tempestuous oratory, unfortunately brought under the
notice of Master Attorney-General, and which did not
lead to a secretary of stateship, it is difficult to say
what might not have happened! These illustrations or
examples at all events prove, if nothing else, that the
ancient fluency associated with this market has not
perished, but merely assumed another form, and taken,
not perhaps a more discursive, but a more lofty and
ambitious direction.

But to resume and conclude our brief market-sketch.
It is obviously impossible to state with any reliable
accuracy the amount of business daily transacted in
this remarkable locality. We have heard enormous
guess-figures mentioned by salesmen-sums so large
as almost to frighten one, and which not being autho-
ritatively based it is useless to repeat. A proximate
idea of the vast business transacted may, however, be
arrived at if it be true, as confidently asserted, that
the gross revenue derived from the market falls very
little if anything short of L.5000 a year-a revenue
chiefly raised by the following tariff:-On any Peter
boat, Gd.; small boat, wherry, or skiff, 18.; hatch boat,
1s. 6d.; great boat, smack, or vessel containing lobsters,
mackerel, fresh herrings, sprats, or plaice, 2s. 6d.;
smacks, vessels, or other craft containing salmon,
barrels of red and white herrings, cod-fish, haddocks,
or any other fish not enumerated, 5s., or if not more
than half-laden, 2s. 6d.; on every cart or van drawn
by two horses, 1s.; by more than two horses, 1s. 6d.:
groundage of oyster boats per day, 2d., and per voyage,
ls. 1d.; metage, d. the bushel.' These do not appear
to be very exorbitant charges, and possibly a century
ago scarcely more than sufficed to defray the ordinary
expenses of the market. But in this, as in many other
matters of public concernment, small beginnings have
thanks to the practical, persevering, commercial cha-
racter, and the rapid growth in numbers and wealth of
our people-attained a magnitude which renders it
imperatively necessary to throw down or indefinitely
enlarge all old boundaries, and to adopt every possible
expedient for meeting the hourly more exigent and
impatient demand springing up on every side. A little
while, and the external framework of Old Billingsgate
will be replaced by a more substantial and commodious
erection; and should the tide of material prosperity
continue to rise as it has done for the last quarter of a
century, there can be no doubt that but very few years
will elapse before new structures on the banks of the
Thames will arise to dispute the honour now monopo-
lised by Billingsgate, of being the sole great London
fishmarket.
THE SIGNAL-MAN OF TRAFALGAR.
[For the following little historical fact, which will be admitted
to possess some interest, we are indebted to a medical officer of
respectability now in India.]
WHILE residing in Upper Stamford Street, Blackfriars,
London, in 1846-7, the attention of my father-who
had served as surgeon of the Tonnant at Trafalgar
was directed to an old and broken-down man who made
a scanty livelihood by crying watercresses and red
herrings through the street. It was this man's practice
to resort to Covent Garden Market every morning in
the season at or before sunrise, to purchase his stock of
cresses, and then for four weary hours his cracked voice
never ceased to sound through the foggy air, except
when a suffocating fit of coughing obliged him to pause
and cling to the area railings for support. He appeared
to be a quick, sharp-witted old man, and had a great
reputation for sagacity among the lower class of neigh-
bours.
In the winter of 1846 his cough was so severe that
we feared his occupation was gone. I endeavoured to
persuade him to take refuge at Guy's, but he would
not hear of this, preferring, he said, to die at home.
The next spring, however, brought him out again. It
was then we discovered that he was an old sailor named
John Roome, and that he had served with Nelson at
Trafalgar-in fact, that he was then a signal-man on
board the Victory.
My father having formerly been acquainted with
Captain Pasco, who was signal-lieutenant of the Victory
at Trafalgar, purposed to write to that excellent officer,
requesting his interest in favour of Roome; but death

came upon my veteran parent while his intention was
still unfulfilled, and some months elapsed before I could
again direct my attention to the affairs of Jolm Roome.
I at length took an opportunity of calling the man in, and
then, seating him before ine, asked him: Who was the
signal-officer on board the Victory at Trafalgar?' He
replied: Mr Pasco, sir.' 'Did you serve under him?'
'Yes.' 'Who, then, hoisted the signal, "England expects
every man to do his duty?" 'I did.' I had felt some-
what prepared for this answer; still, as it was uttered,
I could scarcely refrain from a demonstration of reve-
rence towards the old, embarrassed, squalid man who
sat uneasily before me.
Upon further inquiry I found that he was sixty-
eight years old, and had been a seaman from his youth.
He was not more than three or four years altogether in
the king's service; but his intelligence and previously-
acquired knowledge had doubtless qualified him for
the rating of A.B. soon after he entered the navy.
After Trafalgar he deserted; and the R. (Run) against
his name had disqualified him for a pension. His life
had been one of trial and privation ever since.
I inquired of him whether he would like a berth at
Greenwich. He replied in the affirmative, but did
not appear to pay much attention to the question. It
doubtless seemed to him useless to think about a matter
so far beyond his reach. I desired him, however, to
bring me all his papers in a day or two, and promised
to send copies of them, with an account of his present
necessities, to Captain Pasco, then commanding his old
flag-ship, the Victory, at Portsmouth.
Roome assented to this; but for some time I feared
I should not succeed in obtaining another interview
with him. One day he called five hours after his
appointment; on another he did not come at all, saying
afterwards that he had overslept himself.' Misery and
hard usage had evidently made him suspicious, and
unused him to kindness; and certain indefinite terrors
with regard to the R. against his name in the Admiralty
books still appeared to haunt him. At length, however,
he was caught; his papers-even that with the damna-
tory note of desertion scrawled across it-were copied
out, and enclosed with few lines to Captain Pasco,
giving an account of Roome's alleged service at Trafal-
gar, and requesting that the captain would exert his
influence in procuring the man a refuge at Greenwich.
As quickly as the post would allow I received a
letter from Captain Pasco, thanking me for the interest
I had taken in the cause of his old shipmate Roome,'
but referring me to the enclosure as evidence that his
intercession had been unsuccessful. The accompanying
letter was from a high government official, to the effect
that John Roome could not be admitted to Greenwich,
as there were many other more deserving candidates
still unprovided for. Roome was again summoned;
and as this disheartening news was read to him, the
old man's lip quivered, his eyes filled with tears, and
his cheek grew ashy white. I then knew how strongly
the new hope had fixed itself in his mind. He could
only stammer that he supposed it was no use troubling
the gentleman any more: he had the R. against his
name, it was true, but that an act of indemnity for all
deserters who might surrender themselves had been
issued (I think in 1813); he and many others had sur-
rendered accordingly, and he had hoped to be 'white-
washed,' as he termed it. The only course remaining
appeared to be, to write to Captain Pasco, thanking
him for his humane kindness, and mentioning that
Roome had anticipated forgiveness under the govern-
ment order in question. This was done; but before
my letter could have reached its destination, I received
a note from Captain Pasco, saying, that if Roome
would present himself either at Somerset House or
the Admiralty on a certain day he would be admitted
to Greenwich.
And all this came to pass. A short time afterwards
|
I received a visit from a smartly-dressed Greenwich
pensioner, who carefully deposited a basket of water-
cresses in the passage. I found this edition of John
Roome to be a wonderful improvement upon the tattered
unfortunate of a few months back. He looked stout and
contented; declared that Greenwich was a capital place
for a poor man; and certainly presented an unquestion-
able evidence of the fact in his own person, for his
cheeks were ruddy, and the tearing cough was gone.
He wished to make me a present of a little frigate
which he had built and rigged himself. I told him
that I was about to embark for India, and there I
feared I could not take his present with me. He then
said that he had himself been at Calcutta. India was
a fine country; and that if I would write him a "chit"
before I embarked, he would come and sling my ham-
mock for me in a style that no seaman in Her Majesty's
service could beat. It was not every man,' he assured
me, as could sling a hammock properly; and there
was more in slinging a hammock than gentlemen who
had never been to sea would suppose.' He then went
away, taking his well-laden basket of watercresses
with him. I do not believe that he disgraced his
uniform by crying Watercress oh!' It seemed that
he carried the basket merely as a sign by which his
old acquaintances might recognise the lately ragged
itinerant in the now well-clothed and substantial-
looking Greenwich pensioner.
•
I cannot tell whether Roome is living still. The
snug wards of Greenwich have doubtless not been proof
against the chilling gusts of the last four winters; but
should he still survive, few of the readers of this mar-
rative will, I am confident, defer the opportunity of
seeking out and aiding, with a few of those comforts
which render the downward path of life easy, one whose
name must hereafter stand beside that of NELSON in
the page of history.
IMPOSSIBLE HAPPINESS.
A DREAM.
THE broad, green summer leaves were fanning pleasantly
my brow,
Beside the casement rose entwined, above the streamlet's
flow;
The morning sun was shining, and soft floating on the
air
A matin strain of music rose-the solemn voice of prayer.
The retrospections vague and dim of care and sorrow
fled,
No shadows cast, for peace divine a lasting influence
shed,
The happy dead I mourned no more-the living loved
were true-
And never more were we to part, or breathe the word
'adieu!'
I raised a hand unto my brow by summer leaves thus
fann'd-
No feverish, throbbing pulse replied unto that cool, white
hand;
song,
Discordant memories all were merged in that sweet matin
For dear familiar voices led the holy choral throng.
A cloudless sky, serenely blue-life's cloudless summer
day--
For earth reflected Heaven, and Heaven's glory shouc on
Was opened to my earnest gaze, seraphic in array;
To live was full content-and yet 'twas full content to
high-
die!

SADDLING THE RIGHT HORSE.
In a recent book of travels in the United States the
author speaks of a person in a railway car who com-
miserated the people of England for living under a
monarchy- -a thing, he declared, which he could not
possibly submit to. We believe this is no unusual
account of the state of feeling in the great American
Federation. History tends to confirm the prejudice.
Having read of the tyranny of kings, and the arrogance
of courtiers, it is naturally inferred that the people
who live under monarchical institutions must expe-
rience no little snubbing and ill-usage, and that any
thing like independence among them is out of the
question.
いだ
​This is one of the errors which books and newspapers
have not corrected. The general spirit of literature
confirms the impression that to this day the high in
authority, the titled, and the rich, are oppressors, and
that virtue and nobility of feeling are found only in
a condition of either absolute poverty or moderate
competency.
* See yonder poor, o'erlabour'd wight,
So abject, mean, and vile,
Who begs a brother of the earth
To give him leave to toil;
And see his lordly fellow-worm
The poor petition spurn,
Unmindful, though a weeping wife
And helpless offspring mourn.'

So sings Burns. But if this was ever true, the case is
now curiously changed. Instead of asking leave to
toil, men require to be dealt with, and, properly so, on
terms of fair commercial equality. The question is not,
Will you give me work?" but Will you work for me?'
We of course do not allude to the lazy or incompetent,
for everybody understands that labour is a marketable
commodity which goes according to its practical value.
A skilled workman is as independent as his employer-
and often the more independent of the two; and as
for those whom circumstances or ignorance have made
hewers of wood and drawers of water for their fellow
men, they must take their chance of the greater or less
demand there may be for mere animal labour. But
lower than these there is another class, and a crowded
one too, who demand support without return of any
kind. Your professional criminals and beggars are, in
fact, the most independent of us all. Large numbers,
by the habitual perpetration of offences, contrive to get
board and lodgment for nothing during the greater part
of their existence; and comfortably do these persons
live-more so a vast deal than many who think fit to
PRICE 14d.
depend on their own resources. Then, as for the
pleasures of vagrancy, let those who stroll about
asking for leave to toil' make a confession. So far
as we have seen, the only thing they have to com-
plain of, is being taken at their word. A short time
ago a young vagrant, probably an exile from that most
beneficent of homes, the prison, paid our doorway a
visit. Sans shoes, sans shirt, and clad only in a few
rags, he applied for succour. Work was offered, and
with profound humility and thankfulness accepted.
What was the upshot? After labouring pretty dili-
gently for several weeks, and earning good wages, the
young scamp suddenly absconded, in debt to sundry
poor persons who had befriended him-the humble
family who had cleaned, clothed, and boarded him,
being the most basely treated of all. We should like
to know who in this affair was the party most to be
pitied; which party had most cause to mourn ;'
whether the wandering cheat or those who compas-
sionated him? Literature of course takes the part of
the cheater simply on the ground of his poverty. Its
idea of wealth is a certain amount of income-not
the freedom of the individual to live, move, and have
his being just as his inclination, vile or lofty, dictates.
As for the employer in this case, he was a most
unreasonable person a selfish, pitiless wretch; and
necessarily so, since he was not in a state of virtuous
destitution.
---
The truth is, that in these modern days the old
fancies about the wicked tyrannies of the 'rich'--
using the term in its ordinary meaning--are a sheer
absurdity. The time has come when the very humblest
individual in these realms not only knows his rights,
but how to act upon them. It sometimes even happens
that a man utterly penniless is more peremptory in his
demands than a person in middling good circumstances.
In our law-courts at present there is the case of a des-
titute lad, a lame negro, who fled from slavery, came
to Scotland, and threw himself on the compassion of a
small country town. His wants being kindly relieved,
he now turns round and insists on being pensioned for
life. He claims to be put en permanence on the poor-
roll. Lawyers are found to plead and expend money
for him. Battled from court to court, the claim of this
unfortunate but very impertinent alien will probably
not rest till it has been definitely settled in the House
of Lords, at a cost one way and another of a thousand
pounds. Again, we ask which is the party to be pitied?
the mendicant stranger, with no claim naturally on
the country of his refuge, or the hard-toiling house-
holders who are called on to support him in idleness
for perhaps fifty years to come?-the very bread taken
out of the mouths of their children to feed one, of whose
antecedents they know nothing, and who certainly, in

so far as appearances are concerned, would rather beg
than work.
There is another recent case, in which public opinion
transacts the business of the courts of law-we mean
the case of the squatter in Hyde Park. In this affair
(about the merits of which we know nothing), a poor
woman, right or wrong, is turned out of a location on
which she had fixed herself in that Far West. Well,
this is only a new instance of the traditional wrongs
of the lowly the hard-hearted world sides with the
tyrants of course; and the unfortunate victim-merely
because she is poor and friendless-sinks unnoticed and
uncared for, and is quietly buried under the Woods
and Forests. Is it so? Why, the scream from that
ginger-pop stall is heard all over the kingdom; and
without consideration or inquiry-without the slightest
knowledge of anything appertaining to the question,
but that the complainant is needy and the alleged
oppressors rich-the whole country become partisans of
the squatter. The rich shower in their indignation and
their bank-notes for the relief of the old woman, and
the poor their sympathy and their sixpences; and the
highest nobility in the land are dragged forward to
the bar of the public to answer for their supposed
delinquency.
We should like much that our American friends, who
express terror for the royal and aristocratic principles,
could spend a month or two among us, so as to observe
the real working of our social system. In place of
seeing royalty going about lording it with a crown on
its head and a sceptre in its hand, they would perceive
with no little surprise that it is the people who creep
and crawl about royalty and worry it out of all patience.
Instead of running away from the impersonation of the
monarchical principle, they run after it as children do
at the appearance of a raree - show. When royalty
appears in the places of public resort it is mobbed,
and absolutely pelted with adulation. In the Crystal
Palace, we have on several occasions seen it chased by
a crew of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, in a way
that made one really ashamed of his country. Royalty
wanting only to be let alone, to lead a quiet life, to obtain
a little, even a very little, share of that comfort for which
England is famous, the public will not let it. Desiring
no sycophancy, people will in spite of all remonstrance
be sycophantic. Then, for the gratification of all who
have not the good-luck to see what royalty does, persons
are stationed to watch and record its movements.
Every newspaper tells everything it hears of how
royalty eats, drinks, and sleeps, and where and when
it walks and rides. Any ordinary person may enjoy a
stroll in the air and sunshine without remark; but
alas for the poor Queen! she cannot go across the
threshold without drawing forth universal observation.
Once more, we venture an inquiry: Which is the
oppressor, which the oppressed? Fie upon literature for
catering to an appetite vulgar and revolting to every
sense of delicacy, decency, and self-respect!*
ROYALTY-Vulgar Curiosity of the English.-The Queen, the
royal family, and the court, we all know, leave on the 27th
instant by the Great Northern Railway for Balmoral, where only
in all her dominions, it would seem, her Majesty can-thanks to
the instinctive sense of propriety in the Highland or Celtic mind
and manners-enjoy that perfect privacy which even monarchs
delight in. But to get at the Great Northern Station the Queen
will have to go through a world of vulgar staring or curiosity; to
say nothing of the royal party being obliged to stop at Lincoln that
its corporation may have a good look at their sovereign and her
children; the noise and hubbub of happy Doncaster, the joy and
delight and festivities of which will probably keep her Majesty and
family awake all night; the sterner and harder loyalty that will
accompany the party to Holyrood, or the little go' of enthusiasm
that will be discharged after the court at Stonehaven: all of
which displays will at once testify our hearty allegiance and our
intense vulgarity towards the Queen, her crown and dignity,' as
the lawyers have it. We don't treat and behave to the Queen
well when she is in public, that is the truth. There is a touch of
the City alderman about us all on these occasions, which we
should be better without. Our grandfathers deported themselves
But have the Americans themselves more of repub-
lican dignity? It is very well for them to sneer at
'Miss Victoria' in their own country; but what are
their feelings when actually within the personal influence
of royalty? Let Citizen Stevens answer, who beat us
a few weeks ago in a yacht-race, and whose victory,
by the way, was received by the whole country with a
shout of gallant applause, worthy of the finest days of
chivalry. On this occasion the Yankee out-Englished
the English in their monarchical adulation as dashingly
as he shot ahead of them on their own element. No
sooner did he catch a glimpse of Her Majesty looking
on at the sport like her subjects, than, forgetting the
well-known racing privilege both of jockey and steers-
man, off went the republican's hat as if by instinct,
down went the stars and stripes, and the proud flag of
America trailed in the water before the Ocean Queen!
There can of course be no fault found with this,
viewed as an act of politeness: the thing was prettily
done; only just let our American friends be sufficiently
candid to recognise the true relative position of consti-
tutional sovereign and people.
Adjacent in station to royalty, the members of the
aristocracy come in for a share of popular annoyance.
People on no account will let dukes and other great
folks alone: they haunt them in the public thoroughfares
and places of amusement; flock to see their horse-
races; die to get admission to their balls and dinner-
parties; repeat their sayings; and record minutely
the minutest of their doings. The grandees in the
meantime try to keep aloof as well as they can. The
upper-middle classes do not altogether like familiar
association with the middle-middle classes, nor these
with the lower-middle classes; and all the middles
together would rather, if possible, have some distinct
barrier between them and the lower classes. Fashion
is the chief refuge sought by each; but fashion after
fashion gives way successively before the pressure from
beneath, till the toe of the clown galls the kibe of the
courtier. From this social routine philosophy might
extract something good and hopeful. Is it anything
more than the material phase of that progress upwards
which distinguishes the race of Japhet, and more espe-
cially the Anglo-Saxon family? In what is called the
permanent or stationary form of civilisation we see
nothing of the kind. Conditions, dress, manners,
remain there unchanged from generation to generation;
and there, too, art, science, morals, and legislation, have
the same enduring stereotype.
We have said that this universal toadyism-shared
in largely by the Americans, who, with all their rough
independence, are the most notorious tuft-hunters in
creation-is merely the external phase of our progress;
and, in point of fact, while the humbler and middle
classes still worship rank from some species of tradi-
tional reverence, they have, in another sense, got the
upper hand of it, and in the general business of the
world manfully look upon it as a nonentity. At any-
rate, let this be said in conclusion: It is fully time
that literature, whether in the practical or imaginative
form, stated things as they are, and are likely to be.
Instead of echoing antiquated assertions as to the rela-
tive positions and duties of different departments of
society, let it be observed, for the sake of common
sense, that the world of the nineteenth is not the world
of the seventeenth nor of the eighteenth century; that
after a much handsomer fashion to her grandfather: old Farmer
George rode and walked and drove about with his wife and children
without any such molestation as Queen Victoria and her family
are subjected to; at Windsor and at Weymouth he did just as he
chose; he lived in retirement at Kew, or more in public at the
Queen's house in town, without any Court Circular to record his
up-risings and his down-sittings, his breakfasts or his dinners;
that daily record of royal life was a device of his first-born, the
Regent, to conceal the scandals of Carlton House; and we verily
believe that to it the Queen owes more than half the vulgar plague
she suffers from.-Daily News, August.

all classes may now be said to stand in new relations
towards each other; that the man without a coin in
his pocket or a shoe on his foot, is not probably a first-
rate character, ruined by oppression; and that the
'rich'—that is, the man who lives creditably, pays his
way, and helps on society in its enterprises-is not on
that account a villain. These views are unavoidable
deductions from history; and unless they are acknow-
ledged by the literature of the day, its productions can
hardly expect notwithstanding all their sprightliness
and ingenuity-to survive this transition period, and
be carried onwards by the rising mind of the country.
THE SADDLE REQUIRES TO BE PUT ON THE RIGHT
HORSE.
THE LEGEND OF THE LOST WELL.
WE generally found during our stay in the desert
that the Bedouins, though not churlish, were rather
adverse to saying anything to us that might reveal the
inner-working of their minds. Perhaps they were
afraid to compromise their dignity; perhaps they
entertained an indefinite prejudice against us infidels,
in spite of their own laxity and reputed indifference
as Moslems. Often, however, at night they would
watch with Derwish and Saäd outside the tent, and
beguile the long hours by relating some wonderful
adventure, some strange tradition, some poetical legend,
such as could only have the desert for a birthplace. I
often heard snatches of what was said, but rarely a
beginning or an end. For the most part the narrator's
voice did not rise loud enough until the kings, the
princesses, the sheiks, and the magicians, were in full
play-fighting, singing, loving, travelling, and flying
through the air. Besides, the evening's amusement
generally concluded with a 'to be continued.' There
is no people so fond of serials as the Arabs.
One evening, during a long halt, our guide, Wahsa,
usually a silent man, after listening patiently to the
catastrophe of a tale-this time told by an Egyptian-
in which there was more than the usual number of
terrible and fantastic adventures, pleaded for the privi-
lege of speech, and began the following narrative,
which may be called 'The Legend of the Lost Well:'
In ancient times there existed in the desert that lies
to the west of Egypt-somewhere between the sun at
its setting and the city of Siout-a tribe of Arabs that
called themselves Waled Allah, or The Children of
God. They professed Mohammedanism, but were in
every other respect different from their neighbours to
the north and south, and from the inhabitants of the
land of Egypt. It was their custom during the months
of summer to draw near to the confines of the cultivated
country and hold intercourse with its people, selling
camels and wool, and other desert productions; but
when winter came they drew off towards the interior of
the wilderness, and it was not known where they abode.
They were by no means great in numbers; but such
was their skill in arms, and their reputation for courage,
that no tribe ever ventured to trespass on their limits,
and all caravans eagerly paid to them the tribute of
safe-conduct.
Such was the case for many years: but at length it
came to pass that the Waled Allah, after departing as
usual for the winter, returned in great disorder and
distress towards the neighbourhood of the Nile. Those
who saw them on that occasion reported that their
sufferings must have been tremendous. More than
two-thirds of their cattle, a great number of the women
and children, and several of the less hardy men, were
missing; but they would not at first confess what had
happened to them. When, however, they asked per-
mission to settle temporarily on some unoccupied lands,
the curious and inquisitive went among them, and by
degrees the truth came out.
It appeared that many centuries ago one of their
tribe, following the track of some camels that had
strayed, had ventured to a great distance in the desert,
and had discovered a pass in the mountains leading
into a spacious valley, in the midst of which was a well
of the purest water, that overflowed and fertilised the
land around. As the man at once understood the
importance of his discovery, he devoted himself for his
tribe, and returned slowly, piling up stones here and
there that the way might not again be lost. When he
arrived at the station he had only sufficient strength to
relate what he had seen before he died of fatigue and
thirst. So they called the well after him-Bir Hassan.
It was found that the valley was only habitable
during the winter; for being surrounded with perpen-
dicular rocks it became like a furnace in the hot season
-the vegetation withered into dust, and the waters
hid themselves within the bowels of the earth. They
resolved, therefore, to spend one-half of their time in
that spot, where they built a city; and during the other
half of their time they dwelt, as I have said, on the
confines of the land of Egypt.
But it was found that only by a miracle had the well
of Hassan been discovered. Those who tried without the
aid of the road-marks to make their way to it invariably
failed. So it became an institution of the tribe that
two men should be left, with a sufficient supply of
water and food, in a large cave overlooking the desert
near the entrance of the valley; and that they should
watch for the coming of the tribe, and when a great
fire was lighted on a certain hill, should answer by
another fire, and thus guide their people. This being
settled, the piles of stones were dispersed, lest the
greedy Egyptians, hearing by chance of this valley,
should make their way to it.
How long matters continued in this state is not
recorded; but at length, when the tribe set out to
return to their winter quarters, and reached the accus-
tomed station and lighted the fire, no answering fire
appeared. They passed the first night in expectation,
and the next day, and the next night, saying: 'Probably
the men are negligent;' but at length they began to
despair. They had brought but just sufficient water
with them for the journey, and death began to menace
them. In vain they endeavoured to find the road. A
retreat became necessary; and, as I have said, they
returned and settled on the borders of the land of
Egypt. Many men, however, went back many times
year after year to endeavour to find the lost well; but
some were never heard of more, and some returned,
saying that the search was in vain.
Nearly a hundred years passed away, and the well
became forgotten, and the condition of the tribe had
undergone a sad change. It never recovered its great
disaster: wealth and courage disappeared; and the
governors of Egypt, seeing the people dependent and
humble-spirited, began, as is their wont, to oppress them,
and lay on taxes and insults. Many times a bold man
of their number would propose that they should go and
join some of the other tribes of Arabs, and solicit to be
incorporated with them; but the idea was laughed at
as extravagant, and they continued to live on in misery
and degradation.
It happened that the chief of the tribe at the time of
which I now speak was a man of gentle character and
meek disposition, named Abdallah the Good, and that
he had a son, like one of the olden time, stout, and
brave as a lion, named Ali. This youth could not
brook the subjection in which his people were kept,
nor the wrongs daily heaped upon them, and was con-
stantly revolving in his mind the means of escape and
revenge. When he gave utterance to these sentiments,
however, his father, Abdallah, severely rebuked him; for
he feared the power of the lords of Egypt, and dreaded
lest mischief might befall his family or his tribe.
Now contemporary with Abdallah the Good there

was a governor of Siout named Omar the Evil. He
had gained a great reputation in the country by his
cruelties and oppressions, and was feared by high and
low. Several times had he treated the Waled Allah
with violence and indignity, bestowing upon them the
name of Waled Sheitan, or Children of the Devil, and
otherwise vexing and annoying them, besides levying
heavy tribute, and punishing with extreme severity the
slightest offence. One day he happened to be riding
along in the neighbourhood of their encampment when
he observed Ali trying the paces of a handsome horse
which he had purchased. Covetousness entered his
mind, and calling to the youth, he said: 'What is the
price of thy horse?'
It is not for sale,' was the reply.
No sooner were the words uttered than Omar made
a signal to his men, who rushed forwards, threw the
young man to the ground in spite of his resistance, and
leaving him there, returned leading the horse. Omar
commanded them to bring it with them, and rode
away, laughing heartily at his exploit.
But Ali was not the man to submit tamely to such
injustice. He endeavoured at first to rouse the passions
of his tribe, but not succeeding, resolved to revenge
himself or die in the attempt. One night, therefore, he
took a sharp dagger, disguised himself, and lurking
about the governor's palace, contrived to introduce
himself without being seen, and to reach the garden,
where he had heard it was the custom of Omar to
repose awhile as he waited for his supper. A light
guided him to the kiosque where the tyrant slept alone,
not knowing that vengeance was nigh. Ali paused a
moment, doubting whether it was just to strike an
unprepared foe; but he remembered all his tribe
had suffered as well as himself, and raising his dagger,
advanced stealthily towards the couch where the huge
form of the governor lay.
A slight figure suddenly interposed between him and
the sleeping man. It was that of a young girl, who,
with terror in her looks, waved him back. "What
I wouldst thou, youth?' she inquired.
I come to slay that enemy,' replied Ali, endeavouring
to pass her and effect his purpose while there was yet
time,
It is my father, said she, still standing in the way
and awing him by the power of her beauty.
"Thy father is a tyrant, and deserves to die.'
|
him, bound and manacled, and amused himself by revil-
ing and taunting him-calling him a fool for having
yielded to the persuasions of a foolish girl! Ali, in
spite of all, did not reply; for he now thought more of
Amina than of the indignities to which he was subjected;
and instead of replying with imprudent courage, as
under other circumstances he might have done, he
took care not to exasperate the tyrant, and meanwhile
revolved in his mind the means of escape. If he
expected that his mildness would disarm the fury of
Omar, never was mistake greater; for almost in the
same breath with the order for his being conducted
back to prison was given that for public proclamation
of his execution to take place on the next day.
There came, however, a saviour during the night: it
was the young Amina, who, partly moved by generous
indignation that her word should have been given in
vain, partly by another feeling, bribed the jailers, and
leading forth the young man, placed him by the side of
his trusty steed which had been stolen from him, and
bade him fly for his life. He lingered to thank her
and enjoy her society. They talked long, and more
and more confidentially. At length the first streaks
of dawn began to shew themselves; and Amina, as she
urged him to begone, clung to the skirts of his gar-
ments. He hesitated a moment, a few hurried words
passed, and presently she was behind him upon the
horse, clasping his waist, and away they went towards
the mountains, into the midst of which they soon
penetrated by a rugged defile.
Amina had been prudent enough to prepare a small
supply of provisions, and Ali knew where at that
season water was to be found in small quantities.
His intention was to penetrate to a certain distance in
the desert, and then turning south, to seek the encamp-
ments of a tribe with some of whose members he was
acquainted. Their prospects were not very discou-
raging; for even if pursuit were attempted, Åli justly
confided in his superior knowledge of the desert: he
expected in five days to reach the tents towards which
he directed his course, and he calculated that the
small bag of flour which Amina had provided would
prevent them at least from dying of hunger during
that time.
The first stage was a long one. For seven hours he
proceeded in a direct line from the rising sun, the
uncomplaining Amina clinging still to him; but at
If he be a tyrant he is still my father; and thou, length the horse began to exhibit symptoms of fatigue,
why shouldst thou condemn him?'
He has injured me and my tribe.'
Let injuries be forgiven, as we are commanded. I
will speak for thee and thy tribe. Is not thy life
valuable to thee? Retire ere it be too late; and by
my mother, who is dead, I swear to thee that I will
cause justice to be done."
'Not from any hopes of justice, but as a homage to
God for having created such marvellous beauty, do I
retire and spare the life of that man which I hold in
my hands.
So saying Ali sprang away, and effected his escape.
No sooner was le out of sight than Omar, who had
been awakened by the sound of voices, but who had
feigned sleep when he heard what turn affairs were
taking, arose and laughed, saying: Well done, Amina!
thou art worthy of thy father. How thou didst cajole
that son of a dog by false promises!"
Nay, father; what I have promised must be per-
formed.'
Ay, ay. Thou didst promise justice, and, by the
beards of my ancestors, justice shall assuredly be done!"
Next day Ali was seized and conducted to the prison
adjoining the governor's palace. Amina, when she
heard of this, in vain sought to obtain his release.
Her father laughed at her scruples, and avowed his
intention of putting the young man to death in the
cruelest possible manner. He had him brought before
and its male rider of anxiety. They had traversed an
almost uninterrupted succession of rocky valleys, but
now reached an elevated undulating plain covered
with huge black boulders that seemed to stretch like
a petrified sea to the distant horizon. Now and then
they had seen during their morning's ride, in certain
little sheltered nooks, small patches of a stunted vege-
tation; but now all was bleak and barren, and grim
like the crater of a volcano. And yet it was here that
Ali expected evidently to find water-most necessary
to them; for all three were feeling the symptonis of
burning thirst. He paused every now and then, check-
ing his steed, and rising in the stirrups to gaze alicul
or on one side; but each time his search was in vain.
At length he said: Possibly I have, in the hurry of
my thoughts, taken the wrong defile, in which case
nothing but death awaits us. We shall not have
strength to retrace our footsteps, and must die here
in this horrible place. Stand upon the saddlebow,
Amina, whilst I support thee: if thou seest anything
like a white shining cloud upon the ground, we are
saved.",
as it
Amina did as she was told, and gazed for a few
moments around. Suddenly she cried: I see,
were, a mist of silver far, far away to the left."
It is the first well,' replied Ali; and he urged his
stumbling steed in that direction.
It soon appeared that they were approaching a

mound of dazzling whiteness, such as those which we
have often seen in our journey. Close by was a little
hollow, apparently dry. But Ali soon scraped away a
quantity of the clayey earth, and presently the water
began to collect, trickling in from the sides. In a
couple of hours they procured enough for themselves
and for the horse, and ate some flour diluted in a
wooden bowl; after which they lay down to rest be-
neath a ledge of rock that threw a little shade.
Towards evening, after Ali had carefully choked up the
well, lest it might be dried by the sun, they resumed
their journey, and arrived about midnight at a lofty
rock in the midst of the plain, visible at a distance
of many hours in the moonlight. In a crevice near
the summit of this they found a fair supply of water,
and having refreshed themselves, reposed until dawn.
Then Amina prepared their simple meal, and soon
afterwards off they went again over the burning plain.
This time, as Ali knew beforehand, there was no
prospect of well or water for twenty-four hours; and
unfortunately they had not been able to procure a skin.
However, they carried some flour well moistened in their
wooden bowl, which they covered with a large piece of
wet linen, and studied to keep from the sun. They
travelled almost without intermission the whole of that
day and a great part of the night. Ali now saw that
it was necessary to rest, and they remained where they
were until near morning.
'Dearest Amina,' said he, returning to the young
girl after having climbed to the top of a lofty rock and
gazed anxiously ahead, 'I think I see the mountain
where the next water is to be found. If thou art
strong enough, we will push on at once.'
Though faint and weary, Amina said: 'Let us be
going;' and now it was necessary for Ali to walk, the
horse refusing to carry any longer a double burden.
They advanced, however, rapidly; and at length reached
the foot of a lofty range of mountains, all white, and
shining in the sun like silver. In one of the gorges near
the summit Ali knew there was usually a small reservoir
of water; but he had only been there once in his boy-
hood, when on his way to visit the tribe with which he
now expected to find a shelter. However, he thought
he recognised various landmarks, and began to ascend
with confidence. The sun beat furiously down on the
barren and glistering ground; and the horse exhausted,
more than once refused to proceed. He had not eaten
once since their departure, and Ali knew that he must
perish ere
Journey was concluded.
As they neared the summit of the ridge, the young
man recognised with joy a rock in the shape of a
couching camel that had formerly been pointed out to
him as indicating the neighbourhood of the reservoir,
and pressed on with renewed confidence. What was his
horror, however, on reaching the place he sought, at
beholding it quite dry!-dry, and hot as an oven! The
water had all escaped by a crevice recently formed.
All now believed that death was inevitable; and folding
the fainting Amina in his arms, sat down and bewailed
his lot in a loud voice,
Suddenly a strange sight presented itself. A small
caravan appeared coming down the ravine-not of
camels, nor of horses, nor asses, but of goats and a
species of wild antelope. They moved slowly, and
behind them walked with tottering steps a man of
great age with a vast white beard, supporting himself
with a long stick.. Ali rushed forward to a goat which
bore a water-skin, seized it, and without asking per-
mission carried it to Amina. Both drank with eager-
ness; and it was not until they were well satisfied that
they noticed the strange old man looking at them with
interest and curiosity, Then they told their story; and
the owner of the caravan in his turn told his, which
was equally wonderful,
And what was the old man's story?' inquired the
listeners in one breath.
'It shall be related to-morrow. The time for sleep
has come.”.
I was not fortunate enough to hear the conclusion of
this legend, told in the simple matter-of-fact words of
Wahsa; but one of our attendants gave me the substance.
The old man of the caravan was stated to be the
younger of the two watchers left behind more than a
hundred years before at Bir Hassan. His companion
had been killed, and he himself wounded by some wild
beast, which had prevented the necessary signals from
being made. He understood that some terrible dis-
aster had occurred, and dared not brave the vengeance
which he thought menaced him from the survivors. So
he resolved to stay in the valley, and had accordingly
remained for a hundred years, at the expiration of
which period he had resolved to set out on a pilgrimage
to the Nile, in order to ascertain if any members of the
tribes still remained, that he might communicate the
secret of the valley before he perished. Like the first
discoverer, he had marked the way by heaps of stones,
and died when his narrative was concluded. Ali and
Amina made their way to the valley, where, according
to the narrative, they found a large city, scarcely if at
all ruined, and took up their abode in one of the palaces.
Shortly afterwards Ali returned to Egypt, and led off
his father Abdallah the Good and the remnants of his
tribe in secret. Omar was furious, and following them,
endeavoured to discover the valley, of which the tradi-
tion was well known. Not succeeding, he resolved to
wait for the summer; but the tribe never reappeared
in Egypt, and is said to have passed the hot months
in the oasis of Farafreh, to which they subsequently
removed on the destruction of their favourite valley by
an earthquake.
This tradition, though containing some improbable
incidents, may nevertheless be founded on fact, and may
contain, under a legendary form, the history of the
peopling of the oases of the desert. It was, however,
chiefly interesting to me from the manner in which it
illustrates the important influence which the discovery
or destruction of a copious well of pure water may
exercise on the fortunes of a people. It may sometimes,
in fact, as represented in this instance, be a matter of
life and death; and no doubt the Waled Allah are not
the only tribe who have been raised to an enviable
prosperity, or sunk into the depths of misery, by the
fluctuating supply of water in the desert.
PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAITS OF THE MOON.
CERTAIN mysterious agents are perpetually offering
astonishing results to the observation of man. But
some of these results become so familiar from their
constant presence that they cease to awaken interest
in the minds of the many. The existence of the
influence called light is of this nature. From day to
day it fills the sky and overflows the surface of the
world; from night to night it spangles the heavens
with twinkling points, or half dissolves the veil of
darkness in soft floods of phosphorescence. Yet how
few there are who seek to know from whence the
constant visitant comes, or what its nature is! Im-
portant as its interference is in terrestrial affairs, it
yet belongs not to the earth; it is an inhabitant of the
infinite; it comes from the immensely distant sun and
yet remoter stars. Free from the fetters that confine
denser matter to isolated spheres, it floats through the
yawning caverns of space, bridging them over with
beautiful relations and sympathies. Light is the
pulsating stream that connects organised worlds with
organised suns; it makes the universe a living system;
without it, creation would be a dry skeleton - with
it, it becomes a growing, breathing, and palpitating
frame.
But what is the wonderful agent that spreads itself
out thus widely through space? Why does it travel

from one boundary of the vast universe to the other
with undiminished speed, and pass through the rock
of the densest crystal unscathed, and yet stop at the
thinnest and frailest film of black material? Why does
it paint the fields with green, the rose with red, and
the sky with blue? Why does it move in straight
lines, and change the direction of its progress when it
enters a substance of altered density? Why does it
strike the sensitive membranes of the eye with per-
ception? These are questions we may ask, but we
cannot find the resolution of our difficulties in the
answers that are tendered to us from every side. The
grandest generalisations of science are but approxima-
tions to what we would have; they are suggestive rather
than satisfying; they are not facts revealed in their
full and majestic proportions; often they are merely
happy guesses, looking vastly like truth on account of
the boldness of their own pretensions. Still even in
these delusive verisimilitudes features of considerable
interest may be discovered. In the arrangements of
nature twilight precedes the daylight, and the eye of
the anxious watchman, when it cannot perceive the
sun, may find cause to rejoice in the promise of the
dawn.
Scientific men have conceived two different means
by which most of the phenomena that connect them-
selves with the influence of light may be explained.
Some think that as essential atoms float from the cells
of a fragrant plant to strike the nervous membrane,
which lines the cavity of the nose, with the sense of
smelling, material emanations stream from luminous
bodies and rush with almost inconceivable velocity into
the eye, to impress its internal nervous surface with
the sense of vision. Others believe that the universe
is filled with a fine ethereal substance, pervading not
only empty space, but also the inner pores of material
things, and attribute light to the tremulous action of
this ether. They conceive that elastic vibrations are
pushed out round luminous bodies in straight lines,
but without any real onward motion of the substance
of the medium; just as sound waves are pushed out
round sonorous bodies without any real onward motion
of the substance of the air. Now whether we select
for our favour the one or the other of these theories-
whether we consider, with Sir Isaac Newton, that the
eye is first-cousin to the nose, receiving the impulse
of streams of emitted particles that are very much
smaller than the emanations of fragrant bodies; or
whether, with Descartes and Huygens, we deem it a
kind of ear, catching and discriminating tremulous
vibrations that spread elastically through a medium
very much more subtile than the atmosphere-we may
with equal advantage observe for ourselves certain
facts that are beyond all debatable ground.
If any of our readers will hold a small magnifying
lens of glass midway between the flame of a candle
and a piece of white paper, they will perceive that an
inverted image of the flame is distinctly drawn upon
the paper. It is the property of the lens to be able so
to sift, either the undulations or the emanations, which-
ever they may be, that come to it from the flame, that
they are all brought back into similar relative positions
with regard to each other to those which they held at
the first, at a certain point beyond the lens: the
transparent substance effects this sifting in virtue of
the curvature of its surface. The beams from the
several portions of the flame necessarily fall upon the
curved line of glass with different degrees of inclina-
tion; and accordingly as that inclination is greater
or less they are dealt with in their passage through
the transparent substance-in the one case being drawn
down more, and in the other case less.
By the instrumentality of a simple lens of glass
light may be thus made to sketch the exact image of
any object. When the lens is placed in a hole in one
side of a darkened box, the image is formed in the
interior, where the rays thrown off from other sources
cannot interfere with its distinctness. The contrivance
is then termed a dark chamber, or camera obscura.
Imagine that in a darkened chamber of this sort a
screen is spread out for the reception of the image, and
that this screen is formed of a living substance capable
of feeling the picture in all its variety of colours, and
light and shade; the camera obscura then becomes an
organ of vision. The eye is a dark chamber, composed
of dense walls, carefully lined inside with a black
compound. A small transparent window is left open
in front, and behind this opening a series of lens-
shaped humours is placed. At the back of these a
delicate film of nervous matter expands. This expan-
sion is but a continuation of certain minute fibrils of
the brain, which enter the back of the eye bound up
together as a single cord. Images that are to be seen
are formed by the influence of the lens-shaped humours,
and are made to fall exactly upon the nervous expan-
sion. Vision is the mental perception of this impression
when it has been effected upon the sensitive nervous
material.
The outline and general appearance of an object is
recognised, because the several parts of the image
formed in the eye receive from it different quantities
of light. In the direction along which the most intense
and energetic luminous influence comes, bright lights
are seen; in that along which more subdued and faint
action passes, dark shadows appear. Light parts in
an image correspond to intense illumination in an
object; dark portions to deficient light; consequently
if we could find any substance that would undergo
more or less change in the physical arrangement of its
atoms, according to the exact degree of intensity in
which it was affected by light, we could perpetuate the
form of any image, consisting as it does of alternating
tracts of light and shade. We should then only need
to make the image fall upon an even surface of the
sensitive substance for a certain length of time, and
we should find its form indelibly engraved upon the
retentive ground. Chemistry has recently discovered
several substances whose atoms are thus sensitively
alive to the disturbing influence of light, and a new
and very interesting art has accordingly sprung into
existence, which has been designated Photography, or
printing by light.
In the process of M. Daguerre, which is the one
that has been hitherto the most generally employed,
plates of iodised silver are placed in a camera obscura,
exactly in the focus of a very perfectly-formed lens
of glass. The image of any object that is presented
before the lens is then accurately portrayed upon the
plate of silver. Wherever the lights in this image
are strongest, the atoms of the iodine and silver are
the most powerfully disturbed; wherever, on the
other hand, its shadows rest, their original condition is
the most perfectly preserved. Now, whenever light
falls on iodised silver, the change which it produces
gives the iodised metal a strong inclination to combine
itself with mercury, and that inclination is always
exactly proportioned to the intensity with which the
light has acted; consequently if the iodised plate
which has been affected by the image is removed from
the camera and placed amidst the fumes of mercury,
the mercury condenses upon the plate in greatest
abundance wherever the influence of the light has been
exerted most powerfully; wherever the action of the
light has been less, less mercury attaches itself; and
where the deepest shadows have fallen, scarcely a per-
ceptible trace of the mercury is retained. In this
way a metallic picture of any object may be made, in
which mercury becomes the representative of light.
Wherever most light was in the original, most mercury
appears in the fac-simile. It is worthy of remark, that
in the metallic pictures of M. Daguerre's process there
are no colours. All those parts which have been

199
marked in the object by varied colours are merely
indicated in the Daguerreotype drawing by gradations
of shadow. Just as different degrees of light act upon
the iodised silver with proportionally varied energies,
so also do different kinds of colour. This would seem
to indicate that the various colours are themselves but
modifications of light intensity. That colour is rather
an attribute of light than of the objects upon which it
is seen, is beyond all question; for where artificial
lights of a certain description are used for illuminat-
ing objects naturally of the most brilliant and gaudy
tints, they all present themselves as if devoid of colour.
If any of our sceptical readers will place equal parts of
spirits of wine and water in a tin dish, and heat the
mixture by means of a spirit-lamp placed beneath it
until it begins to bubble, and then sprinkle in half a
teaspoonful of salt, and ignite the mixture, he will be
willing to admit-after viewing some variegated shawls
or other gaily-coloured objects by means of its blaze-
that colour is not an intrinsic quality of things seeming
to possess it. The advocates of the undulatory theory
assert that the intensity of light depends upon the
height of the little waves of ether that serve for its
transmission, and variety of colour upon differences of
their breadth. Most probably they are not far from
the truth, although it is hard to conceive how undula-
tions can have been accurately measured when so small
that somewhere between 39,000 and 62,000 are com-
prised in the length of an inch.
The old corpuscular theory propounded by Sir Isaac
Newton found three several parts in each beam of
white light these were separated from each other
when the light was passed through certain trans-
parent substances, and presented themselves apart as
red, yellow, and blue colours. The theory of undu-
lation considers these colours to be modifications of
vibratory movement rather than separate influences;
but it has nevertheless been compelled to admit, as a
consequence of some of the results of the operations of
photography, that there are at least three distinct
powers in the sunbeam which may be separated from
each other, even if the three kinds of colour are allowed
to be identical. For, in the first place, the influence
which produces atomic disturbance in the plates of
Daguerre is not the same with illuminating power: all
the lighting capacity of a sunbeam may be stopped out
from it, and still it will be able to produce the chemical
result. It has been also ascertained that the heating
and lighting power of the sun's rays may be severed
from each other. The solar beam, therefore, contains
within itself at least three several agents-the one con-
cerning itself with illuminating bodies, the other with
heating them, and the third with producing chemical
effects among their atoms. And strange to say, in
different seasons of the year one or other of these
seems to exercise a temporarily preponderant influence
beyond its fellows. In spring the sun's rays have the
most chemical power; in summer they light most; and
in autumn they heat most. During the reign of
chemical power the dormant seeds are roused to life;
during the reign of light, carbon, the agent of solidifi-
cation, is fixed, and soft vegetable tissue is converted
into wood; during the reign of heat, green fruits are
ripened, and young seeds matured. How surprisingly
in this wonderful world of adaptations are means
always adjusted to results! Even the powers of the
sunbeam are meted out with a regard to the work
they are required to do.
It has recently been shewn that a photographic
image may be stamped upon a sensitive plate almost
instantaneously. A series of letters were inscribed
upon the edge of a wheel, which was then caused to
revolve in a dark room with great rapidity. Opposite
to the edge of the revolving wheel a plate of highly-
sensitive substance was placed, and a powerful flash of
electricity was then thrown for a moment upon that
portion of the edge of the wheel that had the plate
before it. The form of the letter that chanced to be
passing at the instant was found to have been plainly
stamped upon the photographic surface, although the
influence which had effected the impression could not
possibly have been continued for more than a small
fractional part of a second.
But the highest possible development of the photo-
graphic art has not been reached even by this singular
triumph. When the difficulties of time are vanquished,
there still remain difficulties of space to overcome.
Even when the most exquisitely-sensitive substances
have been prepared by the chemist, there may be
objects illuminated so faintly that they will not make
any available impression thereon. If those objects are
near to us, we can easily throw more light upon them;
but when they are thousands and millions of miles away
we cannot do this. There are, in fact, myriads of
visible bodies very far removed from the earth which
nevertheless present aspects and features of their own
that science would gladly have the means of accurately
portraying and preserving. The moon, for instance, is
240,000 miles away, and has her face covered with
wonderfully intricate and delicate tracings, that tell a
strange tale regarding her present form and past history.
Now the moon receives about as much solar light upon
any given portion of her surface as terrestrial objects
of like size do when placed in the sunshine. But very
little of that light really reaches us, because it has to
perform a journey of 240,000 miles after it is thrown
off from the lunar surface, and is constantly diffused
and weakened more and more during this progress.
The effective lighting power of the moon is not greater
than that of a single wax-candle placed twelve feet
away. It is 800,000 times less than the lighting power
of the sun.
As the lighting power of the remote moon is so very
much less than the lighting power of near terrestrial
objects placed in sunlight, it has always been feared
that no photographic image of its face could ever be
procured. On one account only a hope has been enter-
tained that it might yet be found possible to form one.
Optical instruments give us the means of catching great
quantities of light even from very faint objects. A lens
three inches across catches 144 times more light from
any given object than the natural pupil of the eye fairly
opened; consequently the image of that object, when
formed in the interior of a camera, by means of such a
lens, must be 144 times brighter than when formed in
the chamber of the eye; and its image, when formed by
a still larger lens than this, would be more brilliant in
the exact proportion of the increased size.
It hence occurred some time since to Professor Bond
of the Harvard University, United States, that although
he could not throw increase of illumination upon the
pale and distant moon, he might make more of the
faint illumination which it naturally possesses available
for the purposes of photography, if he converted the
magnificent telescope at his disposal into a photographic
camera. The object-glass of that telescope is fifteen
inches in diameter, and the image of an object formed
in its focus would therefore be twenty-five times
brighter than the image of the same object formed by
a three-inch lens. He consequently made his arrange-
ments in accordance with these considerations.
placed an iodised plate of silver within the dark tube
of the telescope, so that its sensitive surface exactly
corresponded with the focal position of the large achro-
matic lens; and he made the telescope tube, thus
furnished, follow steadily the moon's motion in the
heavens by means of accurately-adjusted clock-work.
The result of this interesting experiment has been a
signal triumph. The moon has at length been induced
to sit for her portrait, restless and shy-faced as she is.
No less than three exquisite miniatures of her features
were exhibited at Ipswich at one of the sectional

then a second one on 12th August, Professor: Challis
would certainly, on comparing the two, have at once
detected the stranger six weeks before Dr. Galle did.
Dr Galle received Leverrier's calculations of the pro-
bable place of the planet on 22d September, and found
it on the 23d, because he had Bremiher's very accurate
star-map to compare the actual appearance of the
heavens with. Photographic maps of the asterisins, taken
from time to time, will certainly give the astronomer
the means of detecting every vagrant body in the sky;
and that the band is a numerous one, and needs close
watching,
the tung, wil be apparent when it is remembered that
the asteroid planets has been increased
from four to thirteen within six years.
It is already known that the light of sonie stars is
different from that of others. Wollaston and Kranuhofer
have shewn that diverse spectra are produced when the
rays of different stars are made to traverse the same
polarising media. In all probability photography will
yet afford the means of eliciting some information con-
cerning the cause of this difference. Materials may be
found that will prove themselves sensitive to one kind
of light and indifferent to others. If every bright star
does not impress its image upon the same sensitive
surface with equal degrees of facility, the photographist
may hereafter be able to ask questions of nature, in
the Baconian sense, at least with more effect: than we
yet can; and he may get answers from the remoter

to name in connection with the ingenious apparatus for
registering astronomical observations by electricity.
The most interesting of these lunar miniatures is a
small half-face portrait, about as large again as the half
of an ordinary crown-piece, taken at that phase of the
lunation, because the lengthened shadows cast behind
the inequalities of the surface are then seen to most
advantage. When we look at the moon's hemisphere
half in light and half in darkness, the sun is shining
upon it in a direction that is transverse to the one in
which we are viewing it. The sun is shining from the
right, so to speak, while we are looking straight for
ward; consequently the shadows which are cast in the
direction of the sun's beams are spread out lengthwise
before our vision; and most wonderful objects those
shadows are when observed by the telescope under
these advantageous circumstances. Ragged fringes of
blackness rest behind peaks and ring-shaped elevations
of polished silver; round and oval patches of darkness |
fill up cup-like depressions; index-shaped triangles of
jet point out from the back of spots of brilliant light.
In the photographic delineation all these singular fea- |
tures stand revealed. The broken ridge of the Apen-
nines, with its serrated shadows; the ring-bounded
plains of Arzachel, Alphons, and Ptolemy, with their
central isolated peaks, secondary craters, and external
buttress-like spurs; t
the torn and broken cavities
around the Plutonian Tycho: all are there. And be

scarcely possible yet to calculate how great a service
photography may render to the astronomer. The
search for planets and other erratic bodies has hitherto
been conducted by the laborious process of cataloguing
the place of every visible luminary, as it appears
within the field of the observer's telescope, again and
again, so that subsequent comparisons may show
whether any member of the vast host has shifted its
position in the heavens. When Professor Challis, in
July 1846, undertook the search for the planet Neptune,
under the direction of Mr Adams' theoretical calcula-
tions, he registered 3150 star positions, extending over
a tract of the sky sixty times the moon's breadtha

write letters; that he was jaded to death by lugging
them about; that he had no intention of walking into
his coffin for the charge of one penny; and, finally, that
he would have no more of it. Accordingly he made
application for promotion on the strength of his recom-
mendation, was refused as a matter of course, and
vacated his post for the pleasure of a week's rest, which
he declared was more than it was honestly worth.
By this time destiny had made me a housekeeper in
'merry Islington;' and poor Griff, now reduced to his
shifts, waited on me one morning with a document to
which he wanted my signature, the object of which was
to get him into the police force. Though doubting his
perseverance in anything, I could not but comply with
his desire, especially as many of my neighbours had
done the same. The paper testified only as to character;
and as Griff was sobriety itself, and as it would have
required considerable ingenuity to fasten any vice upon
him, I might have been hardly justified in refusing. I
represented to him as I wrote my name, that should he
be successful he would really have an opportunity of
grade. Of course,' said he, 'that is my object; it would
never do for a gentleman to sit down contented as a
policeman. I intend to rise from the ranks, and I trust
you will live to see me one day at the head of the
force.'
suddenly-conceived and indignant remonstrance, hurled
in foolscap at the head of the defalcating member for
the county. During all this time fortune used him but
scurvily his mother's tenants at Midvale clamoured
for a reduction of rent; one decamped without payment
of arrears; repairs were necessary, and had to be done
and paid for. These drawbacks reduced the small
income upon which they lived, and sensibly affected
the outward man of the gentlemanly Griffith: he began
to look seedy, and occasionally borrowed a few shillings
of me when we casually met, which he forgot to pay.
I must do him the credit to say that he never avoided
me on account of these trifling debts, but with an innate
frankness characteristic of his boyhood continued his
friendship and his confidences. At length the happy
day arrived. He received his appointment, bearing
the remuneration of L.200 a year, which he devoutly
believed was to lead to something infinitely greater,
and called on me on his way to the office where he
was to be installed and indoctrinated into his function.
The grand object of her life-the settlement of her
son-thus accomplished, the mother returned to Mid-rising by perseverance in good conduct to an upper
vale, where she shortly after died, in the full conviction
that Griffith was on the road to preferment and fortune.
The little estate-upon the proceeds of which she had
frugally maintained herself and son-passed at her
death into the hands of one of her brothers, none of
whom took any further notice of Griffith, who had
mortally offended them by his instrumentality in
returning the old member for the county, whom it was
their endeavour to unseat. There is a mystery con-
nected with Griffith's tenure of office which I could
never succeed in fathoming. He held it but for six
months, when, probably not being competent to keep
it, he sold it to an advertising applicant, who offered a
douceur of L.300 for such a berth. How the transfer
was arranged I cannot tell, not knowing the recondite
formula in use upon these occasions. Suffice it to say
that Griffith had his L.300, paid his little debts, renewed
his wardrobe and his expectations, and began to cast
about for a new patron. He was now a gentleman
about town, and exceedingly well he both looked and
acted the character: he had prudence enough to do it
upon an economical scale, and though living upon his
capital, doled it out with a sparing hand. As long as
his money lasted he did very well; but before the end
of the third year the bloom of his gentility had worn
off, and it was plain that he was painfully economising
the remnant of his funds.
About this time I happened to remove to a different
quarter of the metropolis, and lost sight of him for
more than a year. One morning, expecting a letter
of some importance, I waited for the postman before
walking to business. What was my astonishment on
responding personally to his convulsive 'b'bang,' to
recognise under the gold-banded hat and red-collared
coat of that peripatetic official the gentlemanly figure
and features of my old schoolfellow Griffith Maclean!
What! Griff?' I exclaimed: is it possible?-can
this be you?'
'Well,' said he, 'I am inclined to think it is. You
see, old fellow, a man must do something or starve.
This is all I could get out of that shabby fellow T-
and I should not have got this had I not well worried
him. He knows I have no longer a vote for the county.
However, I shan't wear this livery long: there are good
berths enough in the post-office. If they don't pretty
soon give me something fit for a gentleman to do, I
shall take myself off as soon as anything better offers.
But, by George! there is not much time allowed for
talking: I must be off-farewell!'
Soon after this meeting the fourpenny deliveries
commenced; and these were before long followed by
the establishment of the universal Penny-post. This
was too much for Griffith. He swore he was walked
off his legs; that people did nothing upon earth but
He succeeded in his application; and not long after
signing his paper I saw him indued with the long coat,
oil-cape, and glazed hat of the brotherhood, marching
off in Indian file for night-duty to his beat in the H-
Road. Whether the night air disagreed with his
stomach, or whether his previous duty as a postman
had made him doubly drowsy, I cannot say, but he was
found by the inspector on going his rounds in a position
too near the horizontal for the regulations of the force,
and suspended, after repeated transgression, for sleeping
upon a bench under a covered doorway while a rob-
bery was going on in the neighbourhood.
He soon
found that the profession was not at all adapted to his
habits, and had not power enough over them to subdue
them to his vocation. He lingered on for a few weeks
under the suspicious eye of authority, and at length
took the advice of the inspector, and withdrew from
the force.

board, offering to all the sons of Adam-whom, for the
especial profit of the slopsellers, Heaven sends naked

the large-printed lie, when my eye fell full upon the
bearer of the board, whose haggard but still gentlemanly
face revealed to me the lineaments of my old friend
Griff. He laughed in spite of his rags as our eyes met,
and seized my proffered hand.
And what,' said I, not daring to be silent, do they
pay you for this?'
'Six shillings a week,' said Griff, and that's better
than nothing.'
'Six shillings and your board of course ?'
'Yes, this board' (tapping the placarded timber);
and a confounded heavy board it is. Sometimes when
the wind takes it, though, I'm thinking it will fly away
with me into the river, heavy as it is.'

I left my old playmate better resigned to his lowly
lot than I thought to have found him. It was clear
that he had at length found a function for which he was
at least qualified; that he knew the fact; and that the
knowledge imparted some small spice of satisfaction to
his mind. I am happy to have to state that this was the THE prodigious progress of steam navigation is daily

as easy to reach California from England as it is now
to get to New Orleans.
One might have thought, after all the vicissitudes
he had passed through, that the soul of Griffith Mac-
lean was dead to the voice of ambition.
Not so,
however. On the first establishment of the street-
orderlies, that chord in his nature spontaneously
vibrated once again. If he could only get an appoint-
ment it would be a rise in the social scale-leading
by degrees who can tell?-to the resumption of his
original status, or even something beyond. . . I

keeping him waiting. Here's a man wants to speak to

armed with a document- -a petition for employment
as a street-orderly, with testimonials of good character,
honesty, and all that. Of course I again append my
signature, without any allusion to the police force. I
wish him all success, and have a long talk over past
fun and follies, and present hopes and future prospects,
and the philosophy of poverty and the deceitfulness of
wealth. We part at midnight, and Griff next day gets
the desiderated appointment.
It is raining hard while I write, and by the same
token I know that at this precise moment Griff in his
glazed hat, and short blouse, and ponderous mud-shoes,
is clearing a channel for the diluted muck of C-
Street, City, and directing the black, oozy current by
the shortest cut to the open grating connected with the
common sewer. I am as sure as though I were superin-

compelled him to become, cast him in the mould of a

the Atlantic in the shortest possible space of time.
At present the voyage from Liverpool extends from
about eleven to fourteen days, according to the port to
be reached. Halifax, in Nova Scotia, is the nearest
point aimed at. But the route chosen seems to admit of
considerable and advantageous variation. The voyage
from Liverpool direct to Halifax possesses the merit of
being continuous. On settling in a berth in England,
there is no shifting till we set foot in America; and
the comfort of this arrangement will always command
attention, for nothing worries a traveller so much as
shifting his person and luggage into new vehicles. In
this, however, as in all other matters, it may be neces-
sary to compromise a little. There will probably be
some who will agree to sacrifice the comfort of going
in but one vessel, in order to save two or three days in
point of time. A saving in this respect may be made
on both sides of the Atlantic. Liverpool is not the
nearest point of the British islands to America; neither
is Halifax the nearest point of America. Ireland
lies nearer America than England, and Cape Breton is
the west coast of Ireland, to Halifax is 2120 miles, and
nearer Europe than Nova Scotia. From Galway, on
to Sydney is 1950 miles. By adopting the shortest of
these routes, a saving of time will be effected. It is
therefore proposed to establish a station for ocean
steamers at a suitable point on the coast of Galway,
whence vessels would at once shoot directly across the
Atlantic-thus avoiding all the entanglements of the
Channel. A public meeting, we observe, has been
held in Dublin to promote transit to America by this
shortened route. Travellers will be conveyed by rail
from London to Holyhead; thence by steamer in four
hours to Dublin; from which the journey by rail to
Galway will occupy about half a day. The inconve
nience of these shifts is obvious; but for mails the
route, with all its changes, is exceedingly appropriate,
and will at least be put to the test. Should the
shifts prove a serious obstacle, or prevent a paying
traffic, what is to hinder the west coast of Scotland
being adopted for the point of departure across the
Atlantic? Already a line of railway is made several
miles from Glasgow in this direction, and if desired it

both of fuel and time would be secured by adopting this
method. Assuming that a steamer, as has been before
stated, consumes 700 tons of coal on a voyage from
Galway to Quebec or New York, she will require only
500 tons to bring her to Sydney, and consequently
can carry at least 300 emigrants additional; which,

Sydney, the chief town and port in Cape Breton, in
public meeting assembled, has put forward' claim as
a transatlantic packet-station. From the port there
is to be a railway through the island to the Gut of
Canso that narrow channel-only a mile and a half
broad-is to be bridged by a floating platform for car-
ringes, as is now done at the Firth of Tay; and having
gained the mainland, the carriages would pass on by
rail on the one hand towards Canada, and on the other
towards the United States. We confess that this design
is rather taking, when a matured consideration is given
to all the relative circumstances. There are points in
Cape Breton nearer to Europe than Sydney, but
objections as regards their approachableness in all
seasons can be stated against them. Of all the ports
in this quarter of the American sea-board, Sydney is
most free of fogs and floating ice. Suppose a steamer
to run at an average speed of 300 miles per day,
Sydney can be reached from Galway in Ireland in six
days twelve hours, and Halifax in seven days two
hours. This does not leave much time in favour of
the former, reckoning the few hours that will require
to be consumed by rail and the passage across the
Gut of Canso. But Sydney is alleged to have the
advantage of accessibility, and to be preferable as a
coaling station. Let us hear what is said by the com-
mittee appointed at the above-mentioned meeting,
If it be assumed that a large steamer goes at the rate
of 300 miles a day, she would consume 700 tons of
coal from Galway to New York. If the vessel made
Sydney a port of call, 500 tons only would suffice: she
would consequently have room to bring out an addi-
tional freight of 200 tons of goods, which, at L.7 per ton.

feature of Sydney-namely, its eligibility as a port
of debarkation for emigrants going to Canada. The
number of emigrants from Ireland alone embarked at
Liverpool in the last year has been stated to be 163,000;

more; and it is to prevent their being so readily
destroyed that the cotton is mixed with the earth and
the salt. This process generally goes on for three
changes of the moon, or for a month and a half, during
which time the tame and the wild gyalls are always
together, licking the decoy-balls; and the Kookie, after
the first day or two of their being so, makes his appear-
ance, at such a distance as not to alarm the wild ones.
By degrees he approaches nearer and nearer, until at
length the sight of him has become so familiar that he
can advance to stroke his tame gyalls on the back and
neck without frightening away the wild ones. He
next extends his hand to them, and caresses them also,
at the same time giving them plenty of his decoy-balls
to lick. Thus, in the short space of time mentioned,
he is able to drive them, along with the tame ones, to
his parrah, or village, without the least exertion of
force; and so attached do the gyalls become to the
parrah, that when the Kookies migrate from one
place to another, they always find it necessary to set
fire to the huts they are about to abandon, lest the
gyalls should return to them from the new grounds.'
A more summary, and much more wonderful process
is mentioned by Mr Catlin-that of merely breathing
into the nostrils of a young bison. "I have often,'
says he, 'in concurrence with a known custom of the
country, held my hands over the eyes of the calf, and
breathed a few strong breaths into its nostrils; after
which I have, with my hunting companions, rode
several miles into our encampment, with the little
prisoner busily following the heels of my horse the
whole way, as closely as its instinct would attach it to
the company of its dam.' Lest this breathing may
seem to the reader to resemble the process of putting
salt on a bird's tail, it is necessary to mention, that
when a female bison is slain, the young one remains
by her side, careless of the approach of the hunter.
The kyloe, or Highland ox, is supposed to be merely
a variety of the famous Chillingham white cattle.
The untamableness of the latter is considered by Mr
Vasey to be nothing more than a myth; and he
assures us that the circumstance of their being 'inva-
riably white is simply owing to the care that is taken
to destroy all the calves that are born of a different
description!'
We have said enough to shew the nature of the
popular matter interspersed in a scientific book; and
we may conclude with observing, that the celebrated
'Ranz des Vaches' is merely a sentimental song sung
by the Swiss cowherds, or played on the bagpipes
while watching their cattle on the mountains. Even in
the time of Rousseau, the marvellous effects of this
air on expatriated Swiss were lost, the people having
lost their taste for the simple pleasures it recalled. The
music has no force but in association, being in itself
tame and meaningless; and the words have a little
more stupidity than sentimental songs in general.
Mr Vasey treats us with a poem, which he calls an
'imitation, but which, fortunately, has no resemblance
either în ideas or forms of expression. For our own
part, as the gods have not made us poetical, we shall
have a better chance of success; and the following,
being rendered as literally as the exigence of the
rhyme permitted, will be found, we flatter ourselves,
nearly as bald as the original :--
Oh, when shall I behold once more
The unforgotten loves of yore!—
The swelling hill, the mountain tall,
The humble cot, the crystal well-
And her, the dearest of them all,
My gentle Isabelle !
Oh, 'neath the shadowing elm, again
When shall I dance to that sweet strain!
When see my vanish'd home once more,
With all the deathless loves of yore!
My father, mother, brother tall,
My sister kind, lambs tended well-
And her, the dearest of them all,
My gentle Isabelle !
THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON.
September 1851.
TALK at present and of late has been de omnibus
rebus; so much so, that it would not be easy to pick
out any subject as the special one, as you may judge
from the summary which here awaits you. Among
one set you will hear the announced closing of the
Exhibition on the 11th October canvassed pretty freely:
for some it is too early; for others, too late; while others
would not have it closed at all. The granting of medals
to all the exhibitors is not relished by those who hoped
to realise exclusive distinctions in their own persons,
and is relished by a large number who, having done
their best to make a creditable display, are naturally
gratified that their endeavours should be recognised,
and that they will be able to possess and hand down to
posterity a disc of metal in evidence of their prowess in
the field of industry. The giving of medals for services
rendered in bringing together hundreds of thousands of
men to shake hands instead of to fight, will be some-
thing new in the history of the world. Then, again,
surprise is expressed that no public announcement has
yet been made of the awards of special medals, and
some unruly discontent on this point refuses to be
appeased. The surplus, too, is a cause of wonder:
what is to be done with it? And how will the Execu-
tive Committee be rewarded? Are they to be knighted,
promoted, or pensioned? It is already known that
one of them is to go out as governor of Malta as soon
as he can get away from his duties, and if this be his
recompense, what are the others to have? Thus you see
that we are not free from vexed questions in Exhibition
matters.
་་་་
An invention by Captain Groetaers of the Belgian
engineers has been lately tested at Woolwich. It is a
simple means of ascertaining the distance of any object
against which operations may have to be directed, and
is composed of a staff about an inch square and three
feet in length, with a brass scale on the upper side, and
a slide, to which is attached a plate of tin six inches
long and three wide, painted red, with a white stripe
across its centre. A similar plate is held by an assis-
tant, and is connected with the instrument by a fine
wire. When an observation is to be taken, the observer
looks at the distant object through a glass fixed on the
left of the scale, and adjusts the striped plate by means
of the slide; the assistant also looks through his glass,
standing a few feet in advance of his principal at the
end of the wire, and as soon as the two adjustments
are effected and declared, the distance is read off on the
scale. In the three trials made at Woolwich the distance
in one case, although more than 1000 yards, was deter-
mined within two inches; and in two other attempts,
within a foot. It is obvious that such an instrument,
if to be depended on, will admit of being applied to
other than military surveys and operations, and may
be made useful in the civil service.
There is another contrivance, described by the in-
ventor, Mr Waite, as 'An Instrument for applying Elec-
tric Heat in Dental Opérations,' which merits notice.
Its production is the result of an idea that 'electric
heat would come to be used in surgery, and also for
many purposes in domestic arrangements.' The ap-
paratus consists of a cylindrical ivory holder, diminished
at one end, where a curved beak or point of platinum
is inserted, and connected with a Grove's battery of
eight cells by two copper wires, which wires are in
communication with the platinum point. A spring
attached to the cylinder affords the means of making or
breaking the galvanic circuit at pleasure. As soon as

contact is made the platinum point becomes heated,
and is then ready for the dentist's work. 'I am
enabled,' says the inventor, 'to use it for many pur-
poses-namely, to evaporate quicksilver from cements,
and render them much less injurious to teeth than they
otherwise would be; also where too great sensitiveness
exists, and which prevents the operator from removing
the caries; where gums have receded, and left the
necks of teeth highly sensitive to the touch;' in short,
in nearly all remedial operations on the teeth. The
electric heat,' he continues, retains its force diffe-
rently to all other heat which can be applied to the
mouth; the platinum wire can be placed, without the
patient being aware of it, near the part affected; heat
can be produced almost momentarily, and suddenly
deadened; and, as a most surprising phenomenon, and
one which has surprised me very much, in patients of a
highly-nervous temperament, where I have expected
much suffering, none has been endured on its applica-
tion. In many cases it will be found equally efficacious
when holding it near the teeth, as if they were touched
by it. Care must be taken not to continue its appli-
cation too long, as it will burn up and blacken the part
it touches.'
lines, who refused last year a dividend of a shilling a
share, have not been able to exercise that melancholy
privilege this year, for the shilling had dwindled down
to threepence. Directors might always insure fair and
moderate dividends if they would; but as yet they have
missed the true and permanent way of so doing, and
yet the way is not a difficult one, as I may shew you
some day. Sweden and Norway are about to try their
hands at railway enterprise: a small party of engineers
is now at Stockholm contriving all the preliminaries.
If the foreigners send here for rails and locomotives, we
can throw them a good lump of experience into the
bargain.
The London and South-Western Railway Company
are interesting themselves in a friendly society, estab-
lished among the men employed on their line, which
affords a provision for support, medical attendance
during sickness, and a small payment to representatives
in the case of death.' To this society the proprietors
are contributors to the extent of L.150 per annum. It
is in a sound condition, answers its purpose well, and
numbers about 1000 members. It is desirable that, in
accordance with the general wish and the original
intention, there should be added to this society a
provision for superannuation. It is also desirable
that not only the workmen, but the officers and clerks
employed by this company, should be brought within
a superannuation arrangement. The funds for these
purposes must be, in principle, self-supporting; but
the directors are of opinion that it will be both expe-
dient and fair that the proprietors should aid the efforts
of the staff. The provision against accidents, fatal or
class of persons employed about the trains. The num-
ber of persons in the service of the company is 1300, to
whom L.60,000 are paid yearly as wages. The amount
each man would have to pay is 34d. per week, whereby
L.1300 would be raised annually. The company have
voted L.1000 towards a superannuation fund. Similar
arrangements on other lines are said to be working
satisfactorily.
P
Mr Hay, under the auspices of the Admiralty,
is experimenting on galvanism as a moving power
instead of steam for auxiliary screw-vessels belong-
ing to the government. The machinery is to be less
complicated, less bulky, and consequently less heavy,
than that used for steamers, whereby greater space
will be left for berths and stowage. As sea-water
is used for the battery, the cost is said to be but
trifling. In addition to this, it appears that by a modi-permanently injurious, would apply especially to that
fication of Davy's principle, Mr Hay has succeeded in
preventing the corrosion of ships' copper. To talk of
the Admiralty without thinking of dockyards would
not be logical; hence the fact comes up that 28,926
persons, natives and foreigners, visited Woolwich Dock-
yard during the months of May, June, and July, of the
present year, and not fewer than 14,327 in one single
week of August. The number that visited and passed
through the avenues' of Greenwich Hospital in the
same three months was 263,171-more than double the
sum of those last year. It is stated also that in 1850
there were 221,119 visitors to Hampton Court, of whom
58,164 belonged to the month of July; and to the
magnificent gardens at Kew 179,627. When all the
facts and results shall be published for the present
year, we shall have a large and interesting addition
to the data of various social phenomena. Among these
the Post-Office is highly important: the returns for
1850 shew that the number of letters delivered in
the United Kingdom during the twelvemonth was
347,000,000, at a cost of L.2,264,684; while in 1839
the cost of delivering 75,000,000 only was L.2,339,737
so that, as is said, we now get five letters for the
former expense of one. In how far railways have con-
tributed to this result may be judged of from the
fact, that in January last one day's mail-transport
on railways and their branches was 17,246 miles.
The electric telegraph is stretching into Hungary, as
ready to flash Magyar signals as to speak English.
The Great Western Company at last are going to extend
their wires, and bring London into communication
with Exeter and Plymouth-an undertaking of some
importance, seeing that the latter is the port for India
packets. The work is to be done by the Telegraph
Company, who have just ‘reinsulated' the wires on the
London, Liverpool, and Manchester lines. Altogether,
they have now 970 miles in hand, which, when fixed,
they will keep in order at a 'fixed rental'-an arrange-
ment preferred by several railway companies to that of
having the maintenance of the telegraph entirely under
their own charge. Apropos of railways, they have been
feelingly talked about: competition is telling on some of
them. Certain shareholders of one of our metropolitan
Talking of railways reminds me that certain canal
owners, finding the iron highway prejudicial to their
watery one, have excogitated ways and means to acce-
lerate their traffic. They have had a canal steamer
built at Bristol, which by tugging is to supersede
horses' towing. A good deal of ingenuity is displayed
in the construction of the vessel: the engine is compact,
and moves an improved propeller by direct action;
and with all her crew and stores on board draws
but 3 feet 9 inches of water. The propeller, known
as Griffith's, is dissimilar to those in ordinary use, in
which the blades, broad at the extremity, are narrow
at the middle; for it has its centre formed into a sphere,
one-third or more of the entire diameter of the pro-
peller, with the blades narrower at their extremities,
gradually growing wider up to their junction with the
sphere. With the ordinary screw the water is drawn
through the central portion and driven outwards with
great velocity, at right angles, by the centrifugal
action of the blades, consuming about 25 per cent. of
the total power in destroying the effective action of
the screw blades upon the water.
In Griffith's patent,
on the contrary, the sphere causes the water to come
in the right direction on the widest and most effective
portion of the blades, where they lay hold of and drive
it away in a direct line with the vessel's course, by
which means all commotion of the water is prevented
--an invaluable result for canal navigation.'
action of the propeller helps to keep the channel free
from weeds. The speed attained against the stream of
the Thames was four miles an hour; double-so the
report states--that of horses. If so, and as the cost is
less, languishing canals may begin to look up again.
The

expended about the open-sided omnibuses which have

been running about our streets to the great comfort of
those who ride in hot weather. And about the grand new
Victoria Street, made by private enterprise, now opened
from Westminster Abbey to the Vauxhall Road, along
which, we are told, will be erected specimens of what
architecture can do for the working-classes, as well as for
the wealthy. And about the new suspension-bridge being
built across the Thames from Chelsea Hospital to the
new park at Battersea-the latter to be an additional
breathing and recreation ground for us in populous
city pent.' No coffer-dams are used in the construction
of this bridge. A casing of cast-iron is made to rest on
a foundation of piles, and filled up inside with concrete,
and raised till of the proper height. In this way it
appears that each pier can be built up at less than the
expense of a coffer-dam.
And about, also, a scheme for supplying Madrid with
water, which is to cost L.800,000, and give employment
to a little British talent. And more especially about
Major Rawlinson's deciphering and interpretation of one
of Mr Layard's inscriptions. This is a really interesting
subject. The major, who, as you know, is a most able
philologist and reader of cuneiform and other Eastern
writings, has ascertained that the Sennacherib men-
tioned in Scripture was the builder of the great palace
at Koyunjik, and consequently is able to assign a date
to the erection, which will aid materially in clearing up
the history of Assyrian antiquities. He has further
found some account of the war between this monarch
and Hezekiah, and a statement of the tribute paid by the
conquered king exactly corresponding with that in the
Bible. The names of persons and places are so accurately
given as to leave no doubt of the fact. Jerusalem is
written Ursalimma; Judea, Yahuda; and Hezekiah,
Khazakiyahu. What if there should be further dis-
covered some record of Sennacherib's second siege of
Jerusalem, and the miraculous destruction of his army!
Major Rawlinson says:- -'One of the most interesting
matters connected with this discovery of the identity
of the Assyrian kings is the prospect, amounting
almost to a certainty, that we must have in the bas-
reliefs of Khorsabad and Koyunjik representations from
the chisels of contemporary artists, not only of Samaria,
but of that Jerusalem which contained the Temple of
Solomon. I have already identified the Samaritans
among the groups of captives portrayed upon the
marbles of Khorsabad; and when I shall have accurately

promising localities, and get gold in other ways than
out of Californian rocks. Whether England is to have
a share in the carrying-trade across this route remains
to be seen.
More startling than this is the revival of a great
project which I mentioned to you some time ago, as
you will perhaps remember-a railway from Calais to
Mooltan. This has now come up again in a bolder and
more explicit form. From London to Calcutta is to be
but a seven days' journey! Think of that, and remember
Dominie Sampson's exclamation. However, when you
consider that Calcutta in a direct line is not much
farther off than New York, it ceases to be so very sur-
prising. Of course you know that the first part of the
overland route is from Calais to Marseilles, and from
thence to Alexandria by steamboat. The latter is to
be changed by the new scheme; the steamers are to
make for the Orontes instead of the Nile, and a rail-
road 900 miles long is to be made from the neighbourhood
of Antioch to Busra-the Bassora of the Arabian
Nights-at the head of the Persian Gulf, which would
leave a much shorter sea-voyage to Bombay than the
present one from Suez. But the grand object is to
avoid the sea altogether: the line, therefore, would be
continued from Busra across Beloochistan, and on to
Calcutta; another portion would connect Constantinople
with Antioch, and before long Constantinople will be
brought into communication with the European system
of railways, which, as you know, extends at present
into Hungary, and is to be continued to Orsova, whence
to Stamboul is but 345 miles. The whole distance
from London to Calcutta would be by the route here
indicated 5600 miles; of which, reckoning the railways
across Europe and those now being made in India,
2600 miles are safe to be opened. The intervening
distance will be a mighty field for engineering enter-
prise; one in which the West may pay back-if we
really owe it-some of the knowledge said to have been
derived from the East. Locomotives in that inert
land will indeed be a wonder; and if excursion-trains
should some day run to Nineveh, we shall be able to
go and see with our own eyes those places and anti-
quities which we now read about with such interest.

Now that travelling has become a possibility with
almost every one, anything relating to travelling facili-

effect of converting talk into real enterprise. Of course

discussed over and over again by all sorts of people

another was the shortest; another impracticable-the

SOMETHING WANTING.
WHEN people speak of the high civilisation attained
in the British islands, they seem to be forgetful that
social improvement has not by any means reached the
whole people that our boasted civilisation, with its
many wonderful manifestations, is in reality only a
piece of diversified patchwork-refinement and rags,
grandeur and starvation. City life has its eddy corners,
where poverty nestles, and vice may be said to be a
matter of business; and to these obscurities, the eulo-
gist of modern civilisation may occasionally give a
passing glance, and satisfy himself that what he sees
is incurable.
But besides these urban horrors—which, by the way,
give one but a poor idea of social tendencies-there is
something equally grievous, but which, being not quite
in the everyday walk of the public, appears to be
generally unknown, and at best engages the smallest
degree of notice. This something is a historical
curiosity. These islands were invaded and settled by
a people of advanced intelligence many centuries ago.
The Anglo-Saxon race have had Great Britain in their
hands for more than a thousand years; and latterly
this race has made more marvellous efforts at improve-
ment than any other. Now here is the curious thing.
The country which the Anglo-Saxons have appro-
priated and made a chosen seat of their skill they have
not yet endorsed with their language nor induced to
comprehend their institutions. Till this instant there
are spots of no inconsiderable extent where the inhabi-
tants are scarcely advanced from a period of primitive
rudeness, and who in their vernacular tongue, their
dwellings and modes of living, offer a fair specimen of
a state of things five hundred years ago. An indignant
compassion is excited by the maltreatment of Cherokees,
and other cheated and dispossessed tribes of aborigines
in North America; but who looks nearer home, and
pities or attempts to rectify the condition of the
aborigines of these islands? What are the social
characteristics of this unfortunate people? They do
not understand English, and continue to speak a lan-
guage which is utterly useless as regards external
intercourse; they cannot be said to know anything of
regular industry, or the obligations of modern economy;
their houses are for the greater part mere hovels of
stone and turf, destitute of windows or chimney; in
the same apartment in which they eat and sleep, pigs
or cattle eat and sleep also; their whole apparatus of
cooking consists of one or two utensils; their fire is
made on the damp earthen floor without a grate; sub-
sisting, like the lower animals, principally on roots
grown near their wretched dwellings, they are alto-

gether unacquainted with food and luxuries of foreign
origin; if they know of tea, coffee, and sugar, it is only
by hearsay; few of the women and children wear shoes;
and as for school-education, books, newspapers, the
arts of reading and writing, and consequently know-
ledge of the external world-all is a blank,
That this is no unreal picture any one may convince
himself by travelling into the more remote parts of
Ireland, and the Highlands and islands of Scotland.
Yes, within a forty-eight hours' journey of London or
Edinburgh, such scenes may be realised. Indeed,
within six hours of Glasgow, habitations windowless
and chimneyless may any day be seen. The following
graphic account of what is observable on the west
coast of Ireland is given by Dr Wilde:** Shortly
after the British Association met in Dublin in
1835 we spent a week in the island of Achill, and
there witnessed some scenes and modes of life which it
could scarcely be credited were passing at one end of
this small kingdom, while at the other the savans of
Europe and America were met to discourse on science.
There are several villages in Achill, particularly those
of Keeme and Keele, where the huts of the inhabitants
are all circular or oval, and built for the most part of
round, water-washed stones, collected from the beach,
and arranged, without lime or any other cement, exactly
as we have good reason to suppose the habitations of
the ancient Firbolgs were constructed; and very similar
to many of the ancient monastic cells and oratories of
the fifth and sixth centuries, which religious veneration
and the wild untrodden situations where they are
located have still preserved in this country. Those of
our readers who have ever passed the Minaune or
Goat's Track, on the towering cliff that rises above the
village of Keele, with the glorious prospect of Clew
Bay and the broad swell of the western Atlantic before
them, and have looked down upon the pigmy dwellings,
resembling an Indian wigwam, scattered over the beach
beneath, may call to mind the scene we describe.
During the spring, the entire population of several of
the villages we allude to in Achill close their winter
dwellings, tie their infant children on their backs, carry
with them their loys, and some corn and potatoes, with
a few pots and cooking utensils, drive their cattle
before them, and migrate into the hills, where they find
fresh pasture for their flocks; and there they build rude
huts, or summer-houses, of sods and wattles, called
booleys, and then cultivate and sow with corn a few
fertile spots in the neighbouring valleys. They thus
remain for about two months of the spring and early

summer, till the corn is sown; their stock of provisions
being exhausted, and the pasture consumed by their
cattle, they return to the shore, and eke out a miserable
and precarious existence by fishing, &c. No further
care is ever taken of the crops; indeed they seldom

sea those who are totally destitute of means of their
own, and who are at present a sheer burden, not to say a
disgrace, to the community. In a word, Emigration and
Education are two things which, on various grounds,
are required for the abatement of a lamentable and
growing evil. From the ill-considered manner in
which emigration on a wholesale plan has hitherto
been conducted, we mention it in the present instance
with some misgivings. Yet it is surely within the
bounds of possibility to effect the translation of those
masses, and settle them in fields of enterprise courting
their residence.
Considered in a right spirit, there
would be no insurmountable difficulty in the execution.
At all events, the present posture of affairs is far from
creditable, and almost anything would be better than
doing that which indifference might be inclined to
recommend-nothing!
Society cannot shake itself clear of the charge of
cruelly neglecting these people. It is no apology to
say that, according to the rules of modern polity, each
man must look after himself. We take a somewhat
different view of social obligation. When serfdom was
abolished, and all were thrown upon their own resources,
it was the duty of the state to see that all were pre-
pared for this great change in their condition. It did
no such thing. It took no pains to instruct them-left
them a wreck, without the power of shifting from the
spot on which they had stranded: and there are the
wrecks of an old state of things, surviving even till past
the middle of the nineteenth century. Dating from
the period of general manumission, what strides in
human discovery have been made! A new world added
to the old; arts and sciences advanced the most extra-
ordinary lengths. Yet there, hulking in the bosom of
civilisation, are seen hordes of people as far back as
ever. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, a great conti-
nent is becoming covered with thriving and populous A YOUNG French traveller, named Ernest Leroy, on
cities-settlements advancing into the wilds at the rate arriving at Naples, found himself during the first few
of twenty miles per annum; and, wonderful to tell-days quite confused by the multitude of his impressions.
here, in these small islands, with their boasted mission
to civilise and take the world by storm, there con-
tinue to live great numbers of people who have not
got the length of speaking the common vernacular,
and who, to all appearance, will go on living in their
deplorable half-famished barbarism to the end of time.
Nothing but the interposition of the state can remedy
this gross social blunder. For the most part landlords
are not to blame; neither is it in their power to cure
the wretchedness that prevails. The whole thing must
be viewed comprehensively, as a national misfortune.
In the first place, it is a scandalous shame for the state
to have so long left the country without such a system
of education as would make sure of at least teaching
every child to speak and read the English tongue.
What a grand thing for a minister to have perilled
his place upon, would a proposal for such a scheme of
instruction have been! Let this, then, be remedied
without loss of time-or England, with thy boasts, be
for ever dumb! Next, there must be a humane system
of removal, where it appears to be wanted; removal to
CLARA CORSINI.
Now as it was in search of impressions that he had
left his beloved Paris, there was nothing, it should
seem, very grievous in this; and yet in the midst of
his excitement there occurred intervals of intolerable
weariness of spirit-moments when he looked upon
the Strada Toledo with disgust, wished himself any-
where but in San Carlos, sneered at Posilippo, pooh-
poohed Vesuvius, and was generally sceptical as to the
superiority of the Bay over the Bosphorus, which he
had not seen. All this came to pass because he had
set out on the principle of travelling in a hurry, or, as
he expressed it, making the most of his time. Every
night before going to bed he made out and wrote down
a programme of next day's duties-assigning so many
hours to each sight, and so many minutes to each meal,
but forgetting altogether to allow himself any oppor-
tunity for repose or digestion.
Thus he had come from Paris vid Milan, Florence,
and Rome, to Naples-the whole in the space of three
weeks, during which, as will be easily imagined, he had
visited an incredible number of churches, galleries,

211
temples, and ruins of every description. In order to
profit as much as possible by his travels he had
arranged beforehand five or six series of ideas, or medi-
tations as he called them: one on the assistance afforded
by the fine arts to the progress of civilisation; another
consisting of a string of sublime commonplaces on the fall
of empires and the moral value of monumental history;
and so on. Each of these meditations he endeavoured to
recall on appropriate occasions; and he never had leisure
to reflect, that for any instruction he was deriving from
what he saw he might as well have stopped at home.
However, having some imagination and talent, he fre-
quently found himself carried away by thoughts born of
the occasion, and so irresistibly, that once or twice he
went through a whole gallery or church before he had
done with the train of ideas suggested by some previous
sight, and was only made aware that he had seen some
unique painting or celebrated windows of stained glass
by the guide claiming payment for his trouble, and
asking him to sign a testimonial doing justice to his
civility and great store of valuable information. It
is only just to state that M. Ernest never failed to
comply with either of these demands.
When, however, as we have said, he had been two or
three days in Naples, and had rushed over the ground
generally traversed by tourists, our young traveller
began to feel weary and disgusted. For some time he
did not understand what was the matter, and upbraided
himself with the lack of industry and decline of enthu-
siasm, which made him look forward with horror to
the summons of Giacomo, his guide, to be up and doing.
At length, however, during one sleepless night the truth
flashed upon him, and in the morning, to his own sur-
prise and delight, he mustered up courage to dismiss
Giacomo with a handsome present, and to declare that
that day at least he was resolved to see nothing.
What a delightful stroll he took along the sea-shore
that morning with his eyes half-closed lest he might
be tempted to look around for information! He went
towards Portici, but he saw nothing except the sand and
pebbles at his feet, and the white-headed surf that broke
near at hand. For the first time since his departure
from Paris he felt light-minded and at ease; and the
only incident that occurred to disturb his equanimity
was when his eyes rested for half a second on a broken
pillar in a vine-garden, and he was obliged to make an
effort to pass by without ascertaining whether it was
of Roman date. But this feat once accomplished, he
threw up his cap for joy, shouted' Victoire !' and really
felt independent.
He was much mistaken, however, if he supposed it
to be possible to remain long in the enjoyment of that
dolce far niente, the first savour of which so captivated
him. One day, two days passed, at the end of which
he found that while he had supposed himself to be
doing nothing, he had in reality made the great and
only discovery of his travels-namely, that the new
country in which he found himself was inhabited, and
that too by people who, though not quite so different
from his countrymen as the savages of the South Sea
Islands, possessed yet a very marked character of their
own worthy of study and observation. Thenceforward
his journal began to be filled with notes on costume,
manners, &c.; and in three weeks, with wonderful mo-
desty, after combining the results of all his researches,
he came to the conclusion that he understood nothing
at all of the character of the Italians.
In this humble state of mind he wandered forth one
morning in the direction of the castle of St Elmo, to
enjoy the cool breeze that came wafting from the sea, and
mingled with and tempered the early sunbeams as they
streamed over the eastern hills. Having reached a broad,
silent street, bordered only by a few houses and gardens,
he resolved not to extend his walk farther, but sat down
on an old wooden bench under the shade of a platane-
tree that drooped over a lofty wall. Here he remained
some time watching the few passengers that occa-
sionally turned a distant corner and advanced towards
him. He noticed that they all stopped at some one of
the houses farther down the street, and that none
reached as far as where he sat; which led him first to
observe that beyond his position were only two large
houses, both apparently uninhabited. One, indeed, was
quite ruined-many of the windows were built up or
covered with old boards; but the other shewed fewer
symptoms of decay, and might be imagined to belong
to some family at that time absent in the country.
He had just come to this very important conclusion
when his attention was diverted by the near approach
of two ladies elegantly dressed, followed by an elderly
serving-man in plain livery carrying a couple of mass-
books. They passed him rather hurriedly, but not
before he had time to set them down as mother and
daughter, and to be struck with the great beauty and
grace of the latter. Indeed so susceptible in that idle
mood was he of new impressions, that before the young
lady had gone on more than twenty paces he determined
that he was in love with her, and by an instinctive im-
pulse rose to follow. At this moment the serving-man
turned round, and threw a calm but inquisitive glance
towards him. He checked himself, and affected to
look the other way for awhile, then prepared to carry
out his original intention. To his great surprise,
however, both ladies and follower had disappeared.
An ordinary man would have guessed at once that
they had gone into one of the houses previously sup-
posed to be uninhabited, but M. Ernest Leroy must
needs fancy, first, that he had seen a vision, and then
that the objects of his interest had been snatched away
by some evil spirit. Mechanically, however, he
hurried to the end of the street, which he found termi-
nated in an open piece of ground, which there had not
been time for any one to traverse. At length the
rational explanation of the matter occurred to him,
and he felt for a moment inclined to knock at the door
of the house that was in best preservation, and
complain of what he persisted in considering a mys-
terious disappearance. However, not being quite mad,
he checked himself, and returning to his wooden bench,
sat down, and endeavoured to be very miserable.
But this would have been out of character. Instead
thereof he began to feel a new interest in life, and to
look back with some contempt on the two previous
phases of his travels. With youthful romance and
French confidence he resolved to follow up this adven-
ture, never doubting for a moment of the possibility of
ultimate success, nor of the excellence of the object of
his hopes. What means to adopt did not, it is true,
immediately suggest themselves; and he remained
sitting for more than an hour gazing at the great silent
house opposite until the unpleasant consciousness that
he had not breakfasted forced him to beat a retreat.
We have not space to develop-luckily it is not
necessary-all the wild imaginings that fluttered
through the brain of our susceptible traveller on his
return to his lodgings, and especially after a nourish-
ing breakfast had imparted to him new strength and
vivacity. Under their influence he repaired again to his
post on the old wooden bench under the platane-tree,
and even had the perseverance to make a third visit in
the evening; for-probably because he expected the
adventure to drawl out to a considerable length-he
did not imitate the foolish fantasy of some lovers, and
deprive himself of his regular meals. He saw nothing
that day; but next morning he had the inexpressible
satisfaction of again beholding the two ladies approach,
followed by their respectable - looking servant. They
passed without casting a glance towards him; but
their attendant this time not only turned round, but
stopped, and gazed at him in a manner he would
have thought impertinent on another occasion. For
the moment, however, this was precisely what he

wanted, and without thinking much of the consequences
that might ensue, he hastily made a sign requesting an
interview. The man only stared the more, and then
turning on his heel, gravely followed the two ladies, who
had just arrived at the gateway of their house.
'I do not know what to make of that rascally valet,'
thought Ernest. He seems at once respectable and
hypocritical. Probably my appearance does not strike
him as representing sufficient wealth, otherwise the
hopes of a fair bribe would have induced him at any
rate to come out and ask me what I meant.'
He was of course once more at his post in the after-
noon; and this time he had the satisfaction of seeing
the door open, and the elderly serving-man saunter
slowly out, as if disposed to enjoy the air. First he
stopped on the steps, cracking pistachio - nuts, and
jerking the shells into the road with his thumb; then
took two or three steps gently towards the other end
of the street; and at last, just as Ernest was about to
follow him, veered round and began to stroll quietly
across the road, still cracking his nuts, in the direction
of the old wooden bench.

'Well, Alfonso, you are an original person, and I
will not call you a good man, though honesty and
candour be written on your countenance. (Alfonso
smiled, but said nothing.) But listen to me attentively,
remembering that though neither am I a good man,
yet am I a generous one. I passionately love your
mistress.'
'Ah!' said Alfonso with anything but a benevolent
expression of countenance. Ernest, who was no
physiognomist, noticed nothing; and being mounted on
his new hobby-horse, proceeded at once to give a history
of his impressions since the previous morning. When
he had concluded, the old man, who seemed all bene-
volence again, simply observed: 'Then it is the younger
of the two ladies that captivated your affections in this
unaccountable manner?'
'Of course,' cried Ernest; and I beseech you, my
amiable Alfonso, to put me in the way of declaring
what I experience.'
'You are an extraordinary young man,' was the
grave reply; an extraordinary, an imprudent, and, I
will add, a reckless person. You fall in love with a
The villain has at length made up his mind,' solilo-person of whom you know nothing-not even the
quised our lover. He pretends to come out quite by
accident, and will express great surprise when I accost
him in the way I intend.'
The elderly serving - man still came on, seemingly
not at all in a hurry to arrive, and gave ample time for
an examination of his person. His face was handsome,
though lined by age and care, and was adorned by a
short grizzled beard. There was something very
remarkable in the keenness of his large gray eyes, as
there was indeed about his whole demeanour. His
dress was a plain suit of black, that might have suited
a gentleman; and if Ernest had been less occupied
with one idea he would not have failed to see in this
respectable domestic a prince reduced by misfortune
to live on wages, or a hero who had never had an
opportunity of exhibiting his worth.
When this interesting person had reached the corner
of the bench he set himself down with a slight nod of
apology or recognition-it was difficult to say which
-and went on eating his nuts quite unconcernedly.
As often happens in such cases, Ernest felt rather
puzzled how to enter upon business, and was trying
to muster up an appearance of condescending fami-
liarity-suitable, he thought, to the occasion-when the
old man, very affably holding out his paper - bag that
he might take some nuts, saved him the trouble by
observing: You are a stranger, sir, I believe?'
'Yes, my good fellow,' was the reply of Ernest
in academical Italian; and I have come to this
country'
'I thought so,' interrupted the serving-man, per-
sisting in his offer of nuts, but shewing very little
interest about Ernest's views in visiting Italy-by
your behaviour.'
'My behaviour!' exclaimed the young man a little
nettled.
'Precisely. But your quality of stranger has hitherto
protected you from any disagreeable consequences.'
This was said so quietly, so amiably, that the warning
or menace wrapped up in the words lost much of its
bitter savour; yet our traveller could not refrain from
a haughty glance towards this audacious domestic, on
whom, however, it was lost, for he was deeply intent on his
pistachios. After a moment Ernest recovered his self-
possession, remembered his schemes, and drawing a
little nearer the serving-man, laid his hand confidentially
on the sleeve of his coat, and said: 'My good man, I
have a word or two for your private car.'
Not expressing the least surprise or interest, the
other replied: 'I am ready to hear what you have to
say, provided you will not call me any more your good
man. I am not a good man, nor am I your man,
without offence be it spoken. My name is Alfonso.'
name. This, however, is, I believe, according to rule
among a certain class of minds. Not satisfied with
this, you can find no better way of introducing your-
self to her notice than endeavouring to corrupt one
whom you must have divined to be a confidential
servant. Others would have sought an introduction
to the family; you dream at once of a clandestine
intercourse'
'I assure you'- interrupted Ernest, feeling both
ashamed and indignant at these remarks proceeding
from one so inferior in station.
'Assure me nothing, sir, as to your intentions, for
you do not know them yourself. I understand you
perfectly, because I was once young and thoughtless
like you. Now listen to me. In that house dwells
the Contessa Corsini, with her daughter Clara; and if
these two persons had no one to protect them but
themselves and a foolish old servitor, whom the first
comer judges capable of corruption, they would ere
this have been much molested; but it happens that the
Count Corsini is not dead, and inhabiteth with them,
although seldom coming forth into the public streets.
What say you, young man, does not this a little
disturb your plans?'
In the first place,' replied Ernest, I am offended
that you will persist in implying-more, it is true, by
your manner than your words-that my views are not
perfectly avowable.'
"Then why, in the name of Heaven, do you not
make yourself known to the count, stating your
object, and asking formally for his daughter's hand?'
'Not so fast, Alfonso. It was necessary for me to
learn, as a beginning, that there was a count in the case.'
And what do you know now? Perhaps those
women are two adventurers, and I a rascal playing a
virtuous part in order the better to deceive you.'
'You do not look like a rascal,' said Ernest quite
innocently. At which observation the old man conde-
scended to laugh heartily, and seemed from that moment
to take quite a liking to his new acquaintance. After
a little while, indeed, he began to give some information
about the young Clara, who, he said, was only sixteen
years of age, though quite a woman in appearance, and
not unaccomplished. As to her dowry- Ernest inter-
rupted him by saying that he wished for no information
on that point, being himself rich. The old man smiled
amiably, and ended the conversation by requesting
another interview next day at the same hour, by which
time he said he might have some news to tell.
Ernest returned home in high spirits, which sank by
degrees, however, when he reflected that as Alfonso
declined favouring any clandestine correspondence,
there was little in reality to be expected from him.

True, he had given him some information, and he
might now, by means of his letters of introduction,
contrive to make acquaintance with the count. But
though he spent the whole evening and next morning
in making inquiries, he could not meet with any one
who had ever even heard of such a person. 'Possibly,' he
thought, the old sinner may have been laughing at me
all the time, and entered into conversation simply with
the object of getting up a story to divert the other
domestics of the house. If such be the case, he may
be sure I shall wreak vengeance upon him.'
In spite of these reflections, he was at his post- at the
hour appointed, and felt quite overjoyed when Alfonso
made his appearance. The old man said that a plan
had suggested itself by which he might be introduced
into the house-namely, that he should pretend to be a
professor of drawing, and offer his services. Ernest
did not inquire how Alfonso came to know that he
was an amateur artist, but eagerly complied with the
plan, and was instructed to call on the following morn-
ing, and to say that he had heard that a drawing-master
was wanted.
He went accordingly, not very boldly, it is true, and
looking very much in reality like a poor professor
anxious to obtain employment. The contessa, who was
yet young and beautiful, received him politely, listened
to his proposals, and made no difficulty in accepting
them. The preliminaries arranged, Clara was called,
and, to Ernest's astonishment, came bouncing into
the room like a great school-girl, looked him very
hard in the face, and among the first things she said,
asked him if he was not the man she had seen two
mornings following sitting opposite the house on the
bench under the platane-tree.
Now Ernest had imagined to himself something so
refined, so delicate, so fairy-like, instead of this plain
reality, that he all at once began to feel disgusted, and
to wish he had acted more prudently. And yet there
was Clara, exactly as he had seen her, except that she
had exchanged the demure, conventional step adopted
by ladies in the street for the free motions of youth;
and except that, instead of casting her eyes to the earth,
or glancing at him sideways, she now looked towards
him with a frank and free gaze, and spoke what came
uppermost in her mind. Certes, most men would have
chosen that moment to fall in love with so charming
a creature; for charming she was beyond all doubt,
with large, rich, black eyes, pouting ruby lips, fine
oval cheeks, and a mass of ebony hair; but Ernest's
first impression was disappointment, and he began to
criticise both her and everything by which she was
surrounded.
He saw at once that there was poverty in the house.
The furniture was neat, but scanty; and the door had
been opened by a female servant, who had evidently
been disturbed from some domestic avocations. The
contessa and her daughter were dressed very plainly
far differently from what they had been in the street;
and it was an easy matter to see that this plainness
was not adopted from choice but from necessity. Had
Clara come into the room with a slow, creeping step,
keeping her eyes modestly fixed on the chipped marble
floor, not one of these observations would have been
made: the large, dreary house would have been a palace
in Ernest's eyes; but his taste was a morbid one, and
in five minutes after he had begun to give his lesson,
he began to fear that the conquest he had so ardently
desired would be only too easy.
There was something, however, so cheerful and
fascinating in Clara's manner that he could not but
soon learn to feel pleasure in her society; and when he
went away he determined, instead of starting off for
Sicily, as he had at first thought of doing, to pay at
least one more visit to the house in the character of
drawing-master. Alfonso joined him as he walked
slowly homeward, and asked him how things had
passed. He related frankly his impressions, to which
the old man listened very attentively without making
any remark. At parting, however, he shook his head,
saying that young men were of all animals the most
difficult to content.
Next day, when Ernest went to give his lesson, he
was told by Alfonso that the contessa, being indisposed,
had remained in bed, but that he should find Clara in
the garden. There was something romantic in the
sound of this, so he hurried to the spot indicated,
impatient to have the commonplace impressions of the
previous day effaced. This time his disgust was
complete. He found Clara engaged in assisting the
servant-maid to wring and hang out some clothes they
had just finished washing. She seemed not at all
put out by being caught thus humbly employed;
but begging him to wait a little, finished her work,
ran away, dressed somewhat carefully, and returning,
begged he would accompany her to the house. He
followed with cheeks burning with shame: he felt the
utmost contempt for himself because he had fallen in
love with this little housewife, and the greatest indigna-
tion against her for having presumed, very innocently,
to excite so poctical a sentiment; and, in the stupidity
of his offended self-love, resolved to revenge himself by
making some spiteful remark ere he escaped from a
house into which he considered that he had been
regularly entrapped. Accordingly, when she took the
pencil in hand, he observed that probably she imagined
that contact with soap-suds would improve the delicacy
of her touch. Clara did not reply, but began to sketch
in a manner that proved she had listened to the pedantic
rules he had laid down on occasion of the previous
lesson more from modesty than because she was in
want of them. Then suddenly rising without attending
to some cavil he thought it his duty to make, she went to
her piano, and beginning to play, drew forth such ravish-
ing notes that Ernest, who was himself no contemptible
musician, could not refrain from applauding enthusias-
tically. She received his compliments with a slight
shrug of the shoulders, and commenced a song that
enabled her to display with full effect the capabilities
of her magnificent voice. The soap-suds were forgotten;
and Ernest's romance was coming back upon him: he
began to chide himself for his foolish prejudices; and
thought that, after all, with a little training, Clara might
be made quite a lady. Suddenly, however, she broke
off her song, and turning towards him with an ironical
smile said: Not bad for a housemaid, Mr Professor-
is it?'
He attempted to excuse himself, but he was evidently
judged; and, what was more - not as an obscure
drawing-master, but as M. Ernest Leroy. His identity
was evidently no secret; and she even called him by
his name. He endeavoured in vain to make a fine speech
to apologise for his ill-behaviour; but she interrupted him
keenly, though good-humouredly, and the entrance of
Alfonso was fatal to a fine scene of despair he was
about to enact. Clara upon this retired with a profound
salute; and Alfonso spoke with more of dignity than
usual in his manner, and said: 'My young friend, you
must excuse a little deception which has been practised
on you, or rather which you have practised upon your-
self. I am going to be very free and frank with you
to-day. I am not what you take me for. I am the
Count Corsini, a Roman; and because I have not the
means of keeping a man-servant, when the women of
my family go to church I follow them, as you saw.
This is not unusual among my countrymen. It is a
foolish pride I know; but so it is. However, the
matter interests you not. You saw my daughter Clara,
and thought you loved her. I was willing, as on inquiry
I found you to be a respectable person, to see how you
could agree together; but your pride- I managed and
overheard all-has destroyed your chance. My daughter
will seek another husband.'

There was a cold friendliness in Alfonso's tone which
roused the pride of Ernest. He affected to laugh,
called himself a foolish madcap, but hinted that a
splendid marriage awaited him if he chose on his return
to Paris; and went away endeavouring to look uncon-
cerned. The following morning he was on board a
vessel bound for Palermo, very sea-sick it is true, but
thinking at the same time a great deal more of Clara
than he could have thought possible had it been
predicted.
Some few years afterwards Ernest Leroy was in one
of the salons of the Faubourg St Germain. Still a
bachelor, he no longer felt those sudden emotions to
which he had been subject in his earlier youth. He
was beginning to talk less of sentiments present and
more of sentiments passed. In confidential moods he
would lay his hand upon his waistcoat-curved out at
its lower extremity, by the by, by a notable increase
of substance-and allude to a certain divine Clara who
had illuminated a moment of his existence. But he
was too discreet to enter into details.
Well, being in that salon, as we have said, pretending
to amuse himself, his attention was suddenly drawn by
the announcement of Lady D He turned round,
probably to quiz la belle Anglaise he expected to
behold. What was his astonishment on recognising in
the superb woman who leaned on the arm of a tall,
military-looking Englishman, the identical Clara Corsini
of his youthful memories. He felt at first sick at
heart; but, taking courage, soon went up and spoke to
her. She remembered him with some little difficulty,
smiled, and holding out her alabaster hand said gently:
'Do you see any trace of the soap-suds?' She had
never imagined he had any feeling in him, and only
knew the truth when a large, round tear fell on the
diamond of her ring. Charles,' said Ernest awhile
afterwards to a friend, it is stifling hot and dreadfully
stupid here. Let us go and have a game of billiards.'
GRASS-CLOTH OF CHINA.
SOME time ago we called attention by a paragraph in
this Journal to a fabric known as the grass-cloth of
China, specimens of which are not unfrequently seen in
this country, although the history of its production is
involved to some extent in obscurity. The paragraph
alluded to was limited to a detail of some observations
made on the subject by Dr Cleghorn, H.E.I.C.S., at the
meeting of the British Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, held in Edinburgh last year; but the
writer of these remarks having been since furnished
with much additional information from various sources
-though chiefly through the kindness of Dr Cleghorn-
is thus enabled to present in the following paper a com-
plete account of the history of the grass-cloth and the
plant which produces it, a coloured drawing of which is
published by Sir William Hooker in the 'Kew Garden
Miscellany for August 1851.
"
is usually seen in the form of handkerchiefs and shirts;
but in the East it is extensively used as an article of
dress both in China and British India, being from its
strength and fineness peculiarly adapted for clothing
during the hot season. Samples of this substance,
exhibiting a fine silky tissue, were amongst the products
of Chinese industry which were exhibited a few years
ago in the Rue St Laurent; and very fine specimens,
imported by English merchants, may be seen in the
Chinese department of the Great Exhibition in Hyde
Park.
The grass-cloth is the produce of Boehmeria (Urtica)
nivea, belonging to the Urticaceae or nettle family.
Although the common nettle of our own country has
been long known to possess various economical qualities,
and amongst others to yield a strong fibre suitable for
manufacturing purposes,* yet we were scarcely pre-
pared to admit this family of uninviting plants to the
high position in an economical point of view which the
extensive use of the Boehmeria flax shews it to be
entitled to.
The notices of this plant by European botanists have
been hitherto very scanty. Koempfer in 1712 alluded
to the Sijro, or wild hemp-nettle, which, he says, 'makes
good in some measure what want there is of hemp and
cotton, for several sorts of stuffs, fine and coarse, are
fabricated of it;'† and the plant to which he refers in
these remarks is probably the same as the one now
under consideration—a supposition which is confirmed
by the fact, that Thunberg, seventy-two years later
(1784), gives the same vernacular name to Urtica
nivea, which he notices for its valuable fibres. James
Cunningham, in writing to Plukenet, mentioned the
suitableness of the cloth for summer-clothing, for which
it is still held in great esteem. §
The first notice of the Tchou ma in a British publi-
cation appeared in the form of the following note from
the pen of Sir William Hooker in the 'Kew Garden
Miscellany in 1848: Chinese grass-cloth, a very
beautiful fabric manufactured in China, first imported
under the form of handkerchiefs, and more recently to
a considerable extent, as superior to any other fabric,
for shirts. By the kind help of Dr Wallich and Sir
George Staunton, we think it may be safely asserted
that the Chinese grass is the fibre of Boehmeria nivea
(Urtica nivea of Linnæus), a plant belonging to the
urticaceous family-the same tenacity of fibre exist-
ing in U. cannabina, heterophylla, and other species of
Boehmeria.'
Dr Macgowan of Ningpo has instituted inquiries in
various quarters respecting the grass-cloth, and has
been successful in bringing interesting facts to light.
At a meeting of the Agricultural and Horticultural
Society of India, held on 10th May 1849, a communica-
tion was read from him to the effect that the Tchou ma
of China, the plant from which grass-cloth is princi-
pally manufactured, is the same with the Kunchoora of
Bengal.' The specimens exhibited in illustration of
the communication had been submitted to Dr Falconer,
who reported upon them as follows:- The leaf speci-
mens now sent from Ningpo, although wanting in the
flower and fruit, confirm the opinion advanced by me
"
Although the Tchou ma, or Chinese flax, is only
beginning to be known in Europe at the present time,
and the cultivation of the plant has scarcely been
attempted except in our botanic gardens, yet it must
not be supposed that the fabric is new in China, whence
it has reached us. Dr Macgowan states, that it has
been used in China during a period of more than 4100
years, and the natives are so wedded to it that they will
not employ linen as a substitute. Indeed there seems
small inducement for them to do so, seeing that the
delicate fibre of the Tchou ma forms the flax from which
the finest of the Chinese linen fabrics' are manufac-plant thus useful in manufacture, but the roots also, when boiled
tured; and that the substance, in the hands of European
manufacturers, will-according to M. Stanislas Julien,
a French authority-be made into a tissue as soft as
silk, and as fine as, but stronger and tougher than the
best French cambric. In this country the grass-cloth

in my former communication,* that the Tchou ma plant,
as described by Dr Macgowan, is not a species of
Cannabis, but is the same plant as the Boehmeria
nivea of botanists, described under the name of Urtica
tenacissima by Roxburgh. The specimens of China
correspond exactly with those grown in the Botanic
Garden, with which I have compared them. Koempfer
in the "Amoenitates Exotica" gives Mao as one of the
Japan names of the plant; and Thunberg in regard to
its uses says: 66
Cortex profunibus conficiendis et filis
validis ad texturas expetitur."'
At a meeting of the Irish Flax Improvement Society,
held in May last (1851), the secretary brought forward
a communication from Dr Macgowan, with a packet
of seed of the plant from which the grass-cloth is
manufactured in that country, accompanied by a letter
from Dr Bowring, Her Britannic Majesty's consul at
Canton, forwarded through the Board of Trade. The
committee directed that portions should be sent to the
Belfast Botanic Gardens, and to several individual
members of the Flax Society, in order to ascertain if
the plants could be acclimatised, as this fibre might pos-
sibly afford the material for a new textile manufacture.
It is indeed gratifying to know that the introduction of
this important plant to Britain has been taken in hand
by the Irish Flax Improvement Society. Should the
attempt be successful, the Boehmeria will form a valu-
able-nay, an invaluable-addition to our agricultural
productions.
In discussing the subject of Dr Macgowan's commu-
nication, it was observed that hitherto the attempts
made to spin the China-grass fibre on flax machinery
had not been successful, but that probably means could
be devised for producing yarns of good quality, and at
a price to compete with the Chinese yarn; and it was
suggested that if the plant could be cultivated in the
British islands, and the yarn exported to China, the
result might be of considerable importance in a national
point of view.
It may be gleaned from our preceding remarks, that
considerable difference of opinion exists among bota-
nists as to the true species which supplies the Tchou ma;
Dr Macgowan adhering to the opinion of its being a
species of cannabis or hemp, while most others incline
to think it a nettle. We think there is little doubt
that the nettle (Boehmeria) is the plant generally cul-
tivated in China for this fibre, although it appears at
the same time evident that other plants are used in
certain districts to some extent. We are informed by
an eminent merchant in Hong-Kong, that having some
years ago set inquiries on foot among the Chinese with
a view to commercial speculation, he arrived at the
following results:-In the south of China (Canton)
Cannabis sativa (hemp) is used; in the central parts,
such as Soochow, Boehmeria nivea; and in the north
(Tientzinfoo) a malvaceous plant called Sida tilæfolia.
In India the Boehmeria was in Roxburgh's time cul-
tivated for its bark, which abounds in fibres of great
strength and fineness. In the Calcutta Botanic Gardens
it grows very luxuriantly, and blossoms about the
close of the rainy season. The roots of the original
plants, as well as of their progeny, are becoming daily
extended, and continue healthy and vigorous, throwing
up numerous shoots as often as they are cut down for
the fibres of their bark, which may be done four or five
times every year if the soil is good, and care taken of
the plant by watering in the hot weather, and draining
the superfluous moisture in the rains. The plant is as
readily cultivated from cuttings as the willow.†
Valuable translations from Chinese works relative to
the cultivation of the Tchou ma, and the preparation of
its fibre, are given in the Transactions of the Horti-
6
cultural Society of London' (vol. iv., 236-42.) The
instructions for cultivation, and the explanations of the
various processes of preparation, are detailed with great
precision and minuteness, and are amply sufficient to
enable other cultivators of our own country to pursue
this new branch of industry, provided the plant be
found to be cultivable in our climate. The following
observations are from the 'Imperial Treatise of Chinese
Agriculture' (lib. lxxviii., fol. 3):-
:-
For the purpose of sowing the Tchou ma in the third
or fourth month, a light sandy soil is preferred. The
seeds are sown in a garden, or, where there is no garden,
in a piece of ground near a river or well. The ground
is dug once or twice, then beds one foot broad and four
feet long are made, and after that the earth is again
dug. The ground is then pressed down, either with the
foot or the back of a spade; when it is a little firm its
surface is raked smooth. The next night the beds are
watered, and on the following morning the earth is
loosened with a small toothed rake, and then again
levelled. After that half a ching (four pints and a half)
of moist earth and a ho (one pint) of seeds are taken
and well mixed together. One ho of seeds is enough
for one or seven beds. After having sown the seeds, it is
not necessary that they should be covered with earth;
indeed if that were done they would not germinate.
The next thing to be done is to procure four sticks, sharp
at one end, and to place them in the ground in a slant-
ing position-two on one side of the bed and two on the
opposite for the purpose of supporting a sort of little
roof, two or three feet high, and covered with a thin mat.
In the fifth and sixth month, when the rays of the sun
are powerful, this light mat is covered with a thick
layer of straw, a precaution adopted to prevent the
destruction of the young plants by the heat and
drought. Before the seed begins to germinate, or
when the young leaves first appear, the beds must not
be watered. By means of a broom dipped in water the
roof of matting is wetted so as to keep the ground
underneath moist. At night the roof is removed, that
the young plants may catch the dew. As soon as the
first leaves have appeared, if parasitical plants appear,
they must be immediately pulled up. When the plant
is an inch or two high, the roof may be laid aside. If
the earth is rather dry, it must be slightly moistened to
the depth of about three inches. A stiffer soil is now
chosen and thrown into beds, to which the young plants
are to be transferred. The following night the first
beds, in which the young plants are, are to be watered;
the next morning the new beds are to be watered also.
The young plants are then dug up with a spade, care
being taken to keep a small fall of earth round their
roots, and are pricked out at a distance of four inches
the one from the other. The ground is often hoed. At
the end of three or five days the earth must be watered,
and again at the end of ten days, fifteen days, and
twenty days. After the tenth month the plants must
be covered with a foot of fresh horse, ass, or cow
dung.'
It is stated in the 'General Treatise on Agriculture,'
entitled 'Nongtching-tsiouen-chou,' that it is a very
common practice in some parts to propagate the plant
by dividing the entangled roots-a mode more certain
and not requiring so much care as the raising of seed-
lings. It is likewise increased by layers: this plan is
a very quick one.' In parts where roots are difficult
to procure seeds are had recourse to. 'As soon as the
young plants are a few inches high they are watered
with a mixture of equal quantities of water and liquid
manure. Immediately after the stems are cut the
ground must be watered, and this ought to be done
at night or on a cloudy day; for if the plants were
watered in the sunshine they would rust. Great care
must be taken not to make use of pigs' dung. The

In this paper we have detailed all that is at pre-

way of caution to microscopists who may use the

HORACE WALPOLE AND THOMAS GRAY.
AN IMAGINARY DIALOGUE.
[Paris, A.D. 1739.]
Gray. And what sort of evening had you, pray, at
Milor Conway's?
Walpole. Mighty dull it would have been called in
London; but considering the fate of us poor exiles in
a strange land, it passed off well enough. We shook
each other by the hand more warmly than we should
have done in Whitehall or Leicester Square, and felt
comfortable at the flesh-and-blood evidence of every
John Bull face that there is such a country as England
after all.
G. Which one is really in danger of forgetting-one
hears so little about it from the quality in Paris.
W. Paris mentions England now and then in a pro-
verb-as she alludes to Paradise (of which she knows
just as little) or Babylon the Great-
G. Which she is more familiar with, unless Scripture
misleads and my eyesight deceives me.
W. You should have been with us last night at his
lordship's, for we railed against French things and per-
sonages pretty scandalously I promise you, much as we
enjoy ourselves in the naughty heart of them. My
Lord George Bentinck and I had a prodigious dispute
about the merits of Versailles, which he lauded and I
unsparingly abused.
G. For my part, I spent an absolutely uninterrupted
evening in letter-writing-
W. To Dick West, I hope, child?
G. Yes; and about Versailles too.
W. I am infinitely obliged to you for forestalling me.
I should only have made mouths at its palatial magni-
ficence, whereas you were too well pleased with it to
do that.
G. You are mistaken: I thought but poorly of the
place, and told Dick what I thought. For instance, I
am barbarian enough to call the Grand Front a huge
heap of littleness, and to declare of the whole building
that a more disagreeable tout-ensemble you can nowhere
see for love or money; though I admire the back front,
with the terrace and marble basins and bronze statues.
As for the general taste of the place, everything, I tell
him, is forced and constrained; and even you might be
shocked to see how I ridicule the gardens, with their
sugar-loaves and minced-pies of yew, their scrawl-work
of box, their stiff, tiresome walks, and their little
squirting jets-d'eau.
W. Mind you keep your treasonable epistle under
lock and key, or we may both have an exempt laying
Probably he keeps a gaming-house himself.
W. Oh, there's nothing dishonourable in doing that,
you know, here in Paris. More than a hundred of the

open all night-long for any adventurer who likes to
go in.
G. I fancy our absence from the gaming-tables is
one reason why we get on so slowly with the natives.
They have no sympathy with abstinence of that kind.
We must be perfect Huguenots to them.
W. Had you much communication with mon cher
ami of the snuff-box? I hope, if he is a mouchard, you
are not compromised?

The music is as like gooseberry-tart as it is like

G. More so if the gooseberries be sour, and set your
teeth on edge. I shan't venture on another bite, but
confine myself to Corneille and Molière. What a
shame it is the houses are so thin on Molière nights!
W. That's because they 've had nothing but Molière
for such a prodigious time. I don't suppose Addison
himself would continue to be worshipped in London
every night of the year, and for twenty years running.
But Molière has a foremost page in your good books.
G. I owe him a great deal, if only for whiling away
dull hours at Cambridge, where he helped me to forget
those execrable mathematics which are the alpha and

in all the mysteries of the Grand Tour, we must let
the world see what is in us, and appeal to posterity
that imposing fiction which shall one day be fact!
G. If the world knows no more of us a century hence
than it does to-day, posterity will owe us as little as we
owe it. Ah, if one could only rise from the grave in
1839, and search the booksellers' shops to see whether
anything of Walpole or Gray be still on sale! To poor
aspiring authors posterity is what eternity is to Addi-
son's Catoa 'pleasing, dreadful thought!' I wonder
what our great-grandchildren will think of Pope and
Arbuthnot, of Brooke's tragedies and Coventry's dia-
logues. Unless they're greater fools than I suppose
they'll be one may speak disrespectfully of one's
juniors, who are not even going to be born for so con-
siderable a time to come- they will cancel many a
literary verdict of our day; raising the beggar from the
dunghill, where we leave him, to be a companion of
princes, and lowering some of our great Apollos to
silent contempt.

W. Why, plenty of authors have come to this pass
in our own experience, whom Pope's Dunciad' has at
once stripped of immortality and immortalised. Every
generation produces plenty more-people who make a
noise and pother for a few brief moons, and then either
die a violent death, like Mr Pope's victims, by a sort of
justifiable homicide, or else perish from natural causes,
the most natural in the world.
G. There's rather a dearth at present in our home-
literature. Poetry seems to have sunk with the
Jacobites-
•
W. Heaven forbid they should rise again together!
G. Spoken like thy father's son. The best thing I
have seen lately is a satire called London,' said to be
by a young fellow named Johnson, who writes for the
magazines. It was published last year, and ought to
be better known than it is, being very terse and ener-
getic; every line in it is well-loaded, and goes off with
a sharp report that you must listen to.
W. The satire's a sort of translation from Juvenal
-isn't it? I've had it in my hands without reading it.
G. Mr Johnson is no mere translator I promise you.
His poem is rather a transfusion of Juvenalian vis vite
into modern veins; such a satire as the old Roman
himself would have written had he been a subject of
his most sacred majesty the second George.
W. Why, child, you've discovered another star in
the heavens.
G. A fixed one, depend on't; and one that you may
see with the naked eye without telescope or glasses.
W. Your vision is perhaps too keen. Some eyes,
you know, see in the dark; but we're not all gifted
after that feline fashion; and meanwhile Mr-a-a-a
-Johnson-is it?-must try and wait. If he be no
falling star he need not be in a hurry, but can go on
shining till we have time to look at him.
G. His light won't go out yet, never fear. As for
seeing stars in the dark, I don't suppose that faculty is
peculiar to me. When else should we notice them?
This one will probably be gazetted in the astronomical
tables of Parnassus a hundred years hence.
W. In that case the year 1839 ought to have a
record of Mr Gray's prediction as well as Mr Johnson's
sign in the zodaic. How would London' go down
here at Paris? Is it smart enough to take with the
readers of Messieurs Boileau and Voltaire? Mr Pope
is already a prodigious favourite here, and the French
are capital judges of satire.
G. Mr Johnson is too smart for them-that is,
against them: he rails quite angrily against the supple

THE SHEEP-FARMER IN AUSTRALIA.*
THE first step to be taken by our colonists, now that
they had reached the future station, was of course to
secure a legal right to the occupancy of the run; and
Mr Jones at once started for Melbourne for the purpose
of procuring a licence for an extended grant, as it was
evident that, from the nature of the land, the run must
be a large one to prove profitable. It may here be
stated that this point was in due time settled, and the
extent of the run defined: at a later period it was
regularly surveyed by the government surveyor, and a
furrow-boundary drawn. Its extent will appear some-
what fabulous to those of the old country, accustomed
to measure land by acres; but it must be remembered
that only about two-thirds was available pasturage.
It had a river-frontage of about 27 miles, and on the
north side of the river ran 8 miles back; it also in-
cluded about 9 miles on the south side, running back
there 8 miles likewise: making altogether a territory
of about 288 square miles.
A situation was now to be chosen for the head-
station, and a central point was selected on the bank
of the river where it made a convenient bend in front
of the intended buildings. The party had met with a
carpenter at one of the nearest stations, whose services
were put in requisition; and as architectural plans in
a new country are not very intricate or varied, the
design was soon drawn, and some extra hands hired to
carry it into effect. It may be asked, where in the
wilderness are extra servants to be had just as they
are wanted? The problem is thus solved: at busy
seasons, such as lambing or shearing time, mounted
labourers are generally on the move from station to
station seeking employment; and as they engage for a
term, and seldom re-engage with the same master when
that term is expired, there are generally labourers to be
had, willing to enter into an engagement with a new
employer. The fact of a new station being occupied
soon gets known, and as extra hands are usually wanted
at first, such stations are the points of attraction for
those in the neighbourhood out of employment.
They first erected, some distance in the rear of the
situation of the intended house, a small hut, which was
taken possession of by the master; the kitchen was
then built-a single detached room some 20 feet by 10,
built of slabs in the mode before described; and this
became in turn the residence, and the hut was given up
to the men. The larger hut was then commenced, in
front of the kitchen, and was habitable in about eight
months. It consisted of two principal apartments 12
feet by 16, with a passage between them of 5 feet in width
-one used as the living room, the other as the bed-
chamber: two smaller rooms were built as a lean-to
behind; and at the side, to correspond to the kitchen, the
store was erected. Stabling, fowl-houses, &c. completed
the arrangement: stockyards were enclosed with fen-
cing, and two or three paddocks were in course of time
railed in. The shearing-house and wool-shed-an im-
portant part of the establishment of the sheep-farmer-
was placed on the opposite side of the river, some little
distance in the rear of the other buildings. This was
a substantial slab-building of about 110 feet by 40, and
it was placed on the opposite side of the river relative
to the dwelling, as the number of sheep driven there at
shearing time always makes the ground bare for some
distance around, giving it à barren and desolate appear-
ance. Two spots some eight or ten miles up and down
the river, on either side of the head-station, were fixed

The next period of excitement came with October,
when shearing, the important operation of the year,
began. Our friends were under no anxiety respecting
the extra hands necessary, for several gangs of shearers
are sure to be travelling the country at this season; and,
accordingly, a troop of ten or twelve made their appear-
ance one morning with the inquiry: Has the master
hired his shearers yet?'
'No,' says the master; 'how much a hundred will
you take?'
'How much will you give?'
Frank, who had heard of a neighbour hiring at the
rate of 12s. 6d., named that sum.
"That won't do at all; we'll come for one pound.'
'I can't give that.'
'Well, good-night, master.'
'Good-night!' And the worthies dispersed forthwith
to the men's huts, where, after hobbling their horses,
they made themselves comfortable for the night, and
made use of the time to inquire as to the master's
character for liberality, &c. The next morning, while
Frank was at breakfast, came a deputation: 'If you'll
take us all, we'll come for sixteen shillings.'
'No,' says our friend. But they would not abate
more; and when the last of them had filed off past the
river, Frank was fain to 'cooie'* after them, and agree
to their offer. This sort of battle between master and
servant is very common with such men, as they lose no
opportunity for taking in a fresh hand in the matter
of wages, as indeed in every other particular. If the
master or his deputy does not superintend the opera-
tion of shearing, or if the men find him to be ignorant,
they will 'race,' or leave on the bottom, the most valu-
able wool, which is the hardest to cut. A fast shearer
has been known to cut 120 sheep a day; but 60 to 80
is the usual average. The men purchase their own
rations and shears, which are supplied from the
master's store; as each fleece is shorn it is subjected to
the press after having been shaken free from dirt,
and folded upon the folding-table-and packed in bags
brought from Melbourne, always a necessary part of
the stores. The press used by Frank for some time
was merely a weight adjusted by pulleys and common
tackle; but as this was frequently getting out of order,
he subsequently purchased a screw-press - a very
effective though costly article, its price being L.60.
how his balance stood. The usual way of doing busi-
ness is this: The up-country squatter has his agent
in town, to whom he consigns his wool, and upon whom
he draws cheques to pay wages and other expenses.
The account is balanced when the clip arrives, and
often does the farmer find that he is in debt to his
agent. The expenses at first are necessarily great,
but credit is readily obtained-the borrower paying a
variable, sometimes a high rate of interest, and a commis-
sion upon the loan. This system of credit, although
convenient, is apt to generate carelessness in money-
matters; and the custom of living luxuriously when in
town-or 'down the country,' as it is called-sometimes
swallows up much of the year's profits; and although
it is but justice to state, that in general the settlers are
steady and economical men-especially of late years-
still there are always some few fast' ones to be found
too ready to enter into the dissipations of the capital.
Doubtless there are many excuses to be found for men
debarred in a great measure for the greater part of the
year from the society and amusements of their fellows:
it is easy to fancy how reluctant they must be to tear
themselves from the charms and social enjoyments of
the town; still it would be well if some were to remem-
ber the sentiment-May to-day's enjoyment bear
to-morrow's reflection!' and copy the example of our
friend in enjoying themselves during their sojourn
without exceeding the bounds of prudence.
With
regard to the labouring-classes, too often may be
applied to them the colonial phrase 'They earn their
money like horses, and spend it like asses.' The
shepherd or stock-keeper, immediately upon receiving
his balance of wages due at the end of his term of ser-
vice, goes to the nearest inn to change his cheque, and
there, in many instances, he remains day after day, or
week after week, according to the length of his purse,
and for the greater part of the time in a state of intoxi-
cation, until he has spent every shilling.
It may appear somewhat extraordinary to those of
the old country, accustomed to buy their pound of
coffee, and who consider a loaf or two of sugar, and
seven pounds of tea, a large investment, to read of the
items of a squatter's provisioning sent home on the
return of the drays. They took back no less a quantity

pal meat eaten; they have about seventy horses, worth
on the average L.10 each; their store is well filled, and
their improvements are in good repair. The country
around them is much more settled: when first they
occupied the run, they were obliged to send some 150
miles for their letters-the mail-cart now passes their
hut, and delivers their bag twice a week; they are both
in the commission of the peace, and are fast becoming
substantial men. They talk of getting a small run
near town, where they may take in their stock for sale
until prices suit; and where-the climate being more
temperate-they may reside during the hottest part of
the year, appointing a manager at the Henry River.
They have been fortunately free, hitherto, from catarrh
in their flocks-a terrible disease, which sometimes
sweeps away hundreds at once, and depreciates the
value of the survivors, but which seldom appears in a
'new' country. In fact, it seems, in all human pro-
bability, that their onward path is now smooth; the
first difficulties are over; and if they have the average
good fortune, they will soon arrive at that point of life's
journey from which they may look back in security
upon their early trials, as only necessary to be kept in
memory as reasons for thankfulness that they are past.
It would be well perhaps for our settler-as it would
certainly be a conclusion more in accordance with cus-
tom in all such romantic narratives-if this could be
wound up with a happy wedding; but, alas! our friend
is still a bachelor. It would be well perhaps for him-
it would certainly be well for the country of his adop-
tion-were the case otherwise. Woman, after all, is
the great civiliser. What influence so effectual as hers
in polishing the rugged manners of a new settlement,
in alleviating the crosses, and rendering bearable the
toils, of the squatter's daily life? What power so
likely as hers to reform those habits hinted at in our
tale, by making home the source of enjoyment, and
rendering unnecessary the search for happiness else-
where? Admitting that some women are unfitted by
nature or habits for life in the bush, is there anything
in that life alarming to the majority? Certainly not.
Nowhere does the peculiar province of the sex-domes-
ticity, to use a hard word-shew to more advantage
than in the ménage of the squatter. Is there more
neatness and order around a station—the garden better
cultivated-the men less rough and unpolished--the
master more happy and contented, even if not more
prosperous, than his neighbours-be sure a lady-presi-
dent is there; and the more frequently such homes are
met with in the colony-the more extended the sphere
of such influences-the happier will be the state, the
more elevated the social position, of the sheep-farmer
in Australia.
A few particulars may be perhaps advantageously
added on practical matters relative to bush-life. First,
as to the tenure upon which runs are held. At the
time the station above described was occupied, a licence
to hold lands while unsold was granted by government
at an assessment according to the extent. (The Henry
River Run was assessed at L.50.) But now some
changes are about to take, or have taken place, and by
the new regulations lands are to be let by tender annu-
ally, when in settled districts-that is, near and around
towns; in an unsettled country, as Frank's, to have four-
teen years' lease at an assessment according to the
number of stock a run will carry; and all intermediate
lands to have a lease of seven years. When such lands
change hands, the new-comer to take off all 'improve-
ments' at a valuation. The wages of labourers differ
somewhat according to rank, and vary according to the
supply. Shepherds get L.35 to L.50 per annum, with
a hut and rations—namely, twelve pounds of meat, ten
pounds of flour, two pounds of sugar, a quarter of a
pound of tea, and in some places a quarter of a pound
of tobacco; in others they have to buy this last neces-
sary,' together with soap, candles, rice, clothing, &c.
6
from their employer's store. The climate in the interior
is very hot for seven or eight months of the year. There
is very little vegetation at this season, but during the
winter and spring months June to October→which
are very like early autunm in England, vegetation pro-
ceeds rapidly. There is a good supply of excellent fish
in the rivers; and fowl-such as quail, wild turkey,
snipe, &c.-are found in most districts. The hospi-
tality of the bush is proverbial. Men dismount at a
station, secure their horses, and walk in and make
themselves comfortable with precisely the same con-
fidence as if all were their own property; and as 'sun-
down' is the general dinner-hour in the bush, callers"
are continually dropping in at that time: they partake
of the meal-join in a social pipe, and pot of tea or
glass of grog, as the case may be-retire to a tent-bed-
stead and mattress in the sleeping-room; and are often
up and away before the master rises, without wishing
him good-morning.
6
The great want in the bush is the means of educa-
tion, both religious and moral. Children must be
separated early from their parents, or they will grow
up mere shepherds and stock-keepers; but, of course,
as the country becomes settled, this evil will be
gradually diminished. Even now most families have
religious services in their houses on Sunday, at which
their households and dependents assist. But when the
nearest church is 300 miles distant, religious observ-
ances must be often neglected, and the Sunday becomes
a day of comparative rest certainly, but nothing more.
One important subject may be briefly noticed. Who
are best fitted for emigrants? Either the labourer, the
man able and willing to work with his hands, or the
man with some capital, who is thus enabled to use the
hands of others. And even the capitalist, to do well,
must have no small share of industry, energy, and per-
severance. Any one going out without these charac-
teristics (unless he turn shepherd, which employment
will admirably suit even the laziest) may be put down,
to use an expressive colonial phrase, as cranky,' or
not in the possession of common discretion: on the
other hand, with these qualities, conjoined with
prudence and economy, he may not succeed in
amassing a fortune, but he will assuredly secure
comfort and competence.

To those of his acquaintance who may discern the
real hero of the foregoing narrative through the
'nominis umbra' Frank Woodman, the writer begs to
say that the true 'Frank' is not responsible for any
facts or opinions therein expressed; the recollections
of many a pleasant evening passed in his company
afforded the foundation of the sketch which will for the
first time meet his eye in these pages.

was a philosopher: fancy can do much more than
that. Those who fancy themselves labouring under an
affection of the heart are not slow in verifying the
apprehension: the uneasy and constant watching of
its pulsations soon disturbs the circulation, and malady
may ensue beyond the power of medicine. Some phy-
sicians believe that inflammation can be induced in
any part of the body by a fearful attention being con-
tinually directed towards it; indeed it has been a
question with some whether the stigmata (the marks
of the wounds of our Saviour) may not have been pro-
duced on the devotee by the influences of an excited
imagination. The hypochondriac has been known to
expire when forced to pass through a door which he
fancied too narrow to admit his person. The story of the
criminal who, unconscious of the arrival of the reprieve,

kept up throughout the convent for some hours. But
of all dreadful forms which this strange hallucination
took, none was so terrible as that of the lycanthropy,

it to be the axe, is well known. Paracelsus held, 'that
there is in man an imagination which really effects and
brings to pass the things that did not before exist; for a
man by imagination willing to move his body moves
it in fact, and by his imagination and the commerce
of invisible powers he may also move another body.'
Paracelsus would not have been surprised at the feats
of electro-biology. He exhorts his patients to have
'a good faith, a strong imagination, and they shall
find the effects. All doubt,' he says, 'destroys work,
and leaves it imperfect in the wise designs of nature:
it is from faith that imagination draws its strength,
it is by faith it becomes complete and realised; he
who believeth in nature will obtain from nature to the
extent of his faith, and let the object of this faith
real or imaginary, he nevertheless reaps similar results
-and hence the cause of superstition.'
While every day's experience adds some new proof
of the influence possessed by the imagination over the
body, the supposed effect of contagion has become a
question of doubt. Lately, at a meeting in Edin-
burgh, Professor Dick gave it as his opinion that there
was no such thing as hydrophobia in the lower animals:
bewhat went properly by that name was simply an
inflammation of the brain; and the disease, in the
case of human beings, was caused by an overexcited
imagination, worked upon by the popular delusion on
the effects of a bite by rabid animals.' The following
paragraph from the Curiosities of Medicine' appears
to justify this now common enough opinion:-Seve-
ral persons had been bitten by a rabid dog in the
Faubourg St Antoine, and three of them had died in
our hospital. A report, however, was prevalent that
their fatal termination; and no less than six applicants
we kept a mixture which would effectually prevent
who had been bitten were served with a draught of
coloured water, and in no one instance did hydrophobia
ensue.'
So early as 1462 Pomponatus of Mantua came to
the conclusion, in his work on incantation, that all the
arts of sorcery and witchcraft were the result of natural
operations. He conceived that it was not improbable
that external means, called into action by the soul,
might relieve our sufferings, and that there did, more-
over, exist individuals endowed with salutary proper-
ties; so it might, therefore, be easily conceived that
marvellous effects should be produced by the imagina-
tion and by confidence, more especially when these are
reciprocal between the patient and the person who
assists his recovery. Two years after, the same
opinion was advanced by Agrippa in Cologne. The
soul,' he said, if inflamed by a fervent imagination,
could dispense health and disease, not only in the
individual himself, but in other bodies.' However
absurd these opinions may have been considered, or
looked on as enthusiastic, the time has come when they
will be gravely examined.
That medical professors have at all times believed
the imagination to possess a strange and powerful influ-
ence over mind and body is proved by their writings,
by some of their prescriptions, and by their oft-repeated
direction in the sick-chamber to divert the patient's
mind from dwelling on his own state and from attend-
ing to the symptoms of his complaint. They consider
the reading of medical books which accurately describe
the symptoms of various complaints as likely to have an
injurious effect, not only on the delicate but on persons
in full health; and they are conscious how many died
during the time of the plague and cholera, not only of
these diseases but from the dread of them, which brought
on all the fatal symptoms. So evident was the effect
produced by the detailed accounts of the cholera in the
public papers in the year 1849, that it was found
absolutely necessary to restrain the publications on the
subject. The illusions under which vast numbers acted
and suffered have gone, indeed, to the most extravagant
extent: individuals, not merely singly but in com-
munities, have actually believed in their own trans-
formation. A nobleman of the court of Louis XIV.
fancied himself a dog, and would pop his head out of
the window to bark at the passengers; while the
barking disease at the camp-meetings of the Methodists
of North America has been described as 'extravagant
beyond belief.' Rollin and Hecquet have recorded a
malady by which the inmates of an extensive con-
vent near Paris were attacked simultaneously every
day at the same hour, when they believed themselves
A remarkable cure through a similar aid of the
imagination took place in a patient of Dr Beddoes,

he would administer the gas. Sir Humphry put the
bulb of the thermometer under the tongue of the para-

he might be sure whether it would be affected at all by
the inhalation of the gas. The patient, full of faith from
what the enthusiastic physician had assured him would
what was to effect the cure, exclaimed at once that he felt
be the result, and believing that the thermometer was
better. Sir Humphry, anxious to see what imagination
would do in such a case, did not attempt to undeceive
the man, but saying that he had done enough for him
that day, desired him to be with him the next morning.
The thermometer was then applied as it had been the

end of which time the patient was perfectly cured.

Chief-Justice Holt. It seems that for a youthful frolic
he and his companions had put up at a country inn ;
they, however, found themselves without the means of
defraying their expenses, and were at a loss to know
what they should do in such an emergency. Holt,
however, perceived that the innkeeper's daughter
looked very ill, and on inquiring what was the matter,
self off for a medical student, he said that he had an
learned that she had the ague; when, passing him-
infallible cure for the complaint. He then collected
a number of plants, mixed them up with various
ceremonies, and enclosed them in parchment, on which
he scrawled divers cabalistic characters. When all
was completed, he suspended the amulet round the
neck of the young woman, and, strange to say, the
grateful for the restoration of his daughter, not only
ague left her and never returned. The landlord,
declined receiving any payment from the youths, but
pressed them to remain as long as they pleased. Many
years after, when Holt was on the bench, a woman
was brought before him, charged with witchcraft: she

was accused of curing the ague by charms. All she
said in defence was, that she did possess a ball which
was a sovereign remedy in the complaint. The charm
was produced and handed to the judge, who recog-
nised the very ball which he had himself compounded
in his boyish days, when out of mere fun he had
assumed the character of a medical practitioner.
Many distinguished physicians have candidly con-
fessed that they preferred confidence to art. Faith
in the remedy is often not only half the cure, but
the whole cure. Madame de Genlis tells of a girl
who had lost the use of her leg for five years, and
could only move with the help of crutches, while her
back had to be supported: she was in such a pitiable
state of weakness, the physicians had pronounced
her case incurable. She, however, took it into her
head that if she was taken to Notre Dame de Liesse
she would certainly recover. It was fifteen leagues
from Carlepont where she lived. She was placed in a
cart which her father drove, while her sister sat by her
supporting her back. The moment the steeple of
Notre Dame de Liesse was in sight she uttered an
exclamation, and said that her leg was getting well.
She alighted from the car without assistance, and no
longer requiring the help of her crutches, she ran into
the church. When she returned home the villagers
gathered about her, scarcely believing that it was
indeed the girl who had left them in such a wretched
state, now they saw her running and bounding along,
no longer a cripple, but as active as any among them.
Not less extraordinary are the cures which are
effected by some sudden agitation. An alarm of fire
has been known to restore a patient entirely, or for
a time, from a tedious illness: it is no uncommon
thing to hear of the victim of a severe fit of the
gout, whose feet have been utterly powerless, running
nimbly away from some approaching danger. Poor
Grimaldi in his declining years had almost quite lost
the use of his limbs owing to the most hopeless debility.
As he sat one day by the bedside of his wife, who was
ill, word was brought to him that a friend waited below
to see him. He got down to the parlour with extreme
difficulty. His friend was the bearer of heavy news
which he dreaded to communicate: it was the death of
Grimaldi's son, who, though reckless and worthless,
was fondly loved by the poor father. The intelligence
was broken as gently as such a sad event could be: but
in an instant Grimaldi sprung from his chair-his lassi-
tude and debility were gone, his breathing, which had
for a long time been difficult, became perfectly easy-
he was hardly a moment in bounding up the stairs
which but a quarter of an hour before he had passed
with extreme difficulty in ten minutes; he reached the
bedside, and told his wife that their son was dead; and
as she burst into an agony of grief he flung himself
into a chair, and became again instantaneously, as it
has been touchingly described, an enfeebled and
crippled old man.'
revived, another fainting fit succeeded, as if it were
to make up for the omission of the preceding evening!
It is told of the great tragic actress Clairon, who had
been the innocent cause of the suicide of a man who
destroyed himself by a pistol - shot, that ever after,
at the exact moment when the fatal deed had been
perpetrated-one o'clock in the morning-she heard
the shot. If asleep, it awakened her; if engaged in
conversation, it interrupted her; in solitude or in com-
pany, at home or travelling, in the midst of revelry
or at her devotions, she was sure to hear it to the very
moment.
The same indelible impression has been made in
hundreds of cases, and on persons of every variety of
temperament and every pursuit, whether engaged in
business, science, or art, or rapt in holy contemplation.
On one occasion Pascal had been thrown down on a
bridge which had no parapet, and his imagination was
so haunted for ever after by the danger, that he always
fancied himself on the brink of a steep precipice over-
hanging an abyss ready to engulf him. This illusion
had taken such possession of his mind that the friends
who came to converse with him were obliged to place
the chairs on which they seated themselves between
him and the fancied danger. But the effects of
terror are the best known of all the vagaries of the
imagination.
A very remarkable case of the influence of imagina-
tion occurred between sixty and seventy years since
in Dublin, connected with the celebrated frolics of
Dalkey Island. It is said Curran and his gay com-
panions delighted to spend a day there, and that
with them originated the frolic of electing a king
of Dalkey and the adjacent islands,' and appoint-
ing his chancellor and all the officers of state. A
man in the middle rank of life, universally respected,
and remarkable alike for kindly and generous feel-
ings and a convivial spirit, was unanimously elected
to fill the throne. He entered with his whole heart
into all the humours of the pastime, in which the
citizens of Dublin so long delighted. A journal was
kept, called the 'Dalkey Gazette,' in which all public
proceedings were inserted, and it afforded great amuse-
ment to its conductors. But the mock pageantry, the
affected loyalty, and the pretended homage of his sub-
jects, at length began to excite the imagination of
'King John,' as he was called. Fiction at length
became with him reality, and he fancied himself
every inch a king.' His family and friends perceived
with dismay and deep sorrow the strange delusion
which nothing could shake: he would speak on no
subject save the kingdom of Dalkey and its govern-
ment, and he loved to dwell on the various projects
he had in contemplation for the benefit of his people,
and boasted of his high prerogative: he never could
conceive himself divested for one moment of his royal
powers, and exacted the most profound deference to
his kingly authority. The last year and a half of his
life were spent in Swift's hospital for lunatics. He
felt his last hours approaching, but no gleam of return-
reason marked the parting scene: to the very last
instant he believed himself a king, and all his cares
and anxieties were for his people. He spoke in high
terms of his chancellor, his attorney-general, and all
his officers of state, and of the dignitaries of the church:
he recommended them to his kingdom, and trusted
they might all retain the high offices which they now
held. He spoke on the subject with a dignified calm-
ness well becoming the solemn leave-taking of a
monarch; but when he came to speak of the crown he
was about to relinquish for ever his feelings were quite
overcome, and the tears rolled down his cheeks: 'I
leave it,' said he, 'to my people, and to him whom
they may elect as my successor!' This remarkable
scene is recorded in some of the notices of deaths for
the year 1788. The delusion, though most painful to
The imagination, which is remarkable for its un-

A friend once told us of a young relation who was
subject to nervous attacks: she was spending some
time at the seaside for change of air, but the evening-
gun, fired from the vessel in the bay at eight o'clock,
was always the signal for a nervous attack: the
instant the report was heard she fell back insensible,
as if she had been shot. Those about her endeavoured
if possible to withdraw her thoughts from the expected
moment: at length one evening they succeeded, and
while she was engaged in an interesting conversation
the evening-gun was unnoticed. By and by she asked
the hour, and appeared uneasy when she found the
time had passed. The next evening it was evident
that she would not let her attention be withdrawn:

his feelings were gratified to the last while thinking he
was occupied with the good of his fellow-creatures-
an occupation best suited to his benevolent disposition.
AN INDIAN
PET.
THE ichneumon, called in India the neulah, benjee,
or mungoos, is known all over that country. I have
seen it on the banks of the Ganges, and among the old
walls of Jaunpore, Sirhind, and at Loodianah; for, like
others of the weasel kind, this little animal delights in
places where it can lurk and peep-such as heaps of
stones and ruins; and there is no lack of these in old
Indian cities.
That the neulah is a fierce, terrible, bloodthirsty,
destructive little creature, I experienced to my cost;
but notwithstanding all the provocation I received, I
was led into becoming his friend and protector, and so
finding him out to be the most charming and amiable
pet in the world.
In my military career (for the Old Indian was long
attached to the army) I was stationed at Jaunpore, and
having a house with many conveniences, I took pleasure
in rearing poultry; but scarcely a single chicken could
be magnified to a hen: the rapacious neulahs, fond of
tender meat, waylaying all my young broods, sucking
their blood, and feasting on their brains. But such
devastations could not be allowed to pass with im-
punity; so we watched the enemy, and succeeded in
shooting several of the offenders, prowling among the
hennah or mehendy hedges, where the clocking-hens
used to repose in the shade surrounded by their
progeny.
marched upon the stronghold of the enemy. Two neu-
lahs appeared, we fired, and one fell, the other running
off unscathed. We all hastened to the wounded and
bleeding victim, and my little daughter first of all; but
how shall I describe her grief when she saw her little
Jumnie writhing at her feet in the agonies of death!
If I had had the least idea of Jumnie's having formed
such an attachment, I should have spared the guilty
for the sake of the innocent, and Jumnie might long
have lived a favourite pet; but the deed was done.
The neulahs, like other of the weasel kind-and like
some animals I know of a loftier species- are very
rapacious, slaying without reference to their wants;
and Jumnie, although fond of milk, used to delight in
the livers and brains of fowls, which she relished even
after they were dressed for our table.
The natives of India never molest the neulah. They
like to see it about their dwellings, on account of its
snake and rat-killing propensities; and on a similar
account it must have been that this creature was
deified by the Egyptians, whose country abounded with
reptiles, and would have been absolutely alive with
crocodiles but for the havoc it made among the nume-
rous eggs, which it delighted to suck. For this reason
the ichneumons were embalmed as public benefactors,
and their bodies are still found lying in state in some
of the pyramids. Among the Hindoos, however, the
neulah does not obtain quite such high honours,
although the elephant, monkey, lion, snake, rat, goose,
&c. play a prominent part in the religious myths, and
are styled the Bâhons, or vehicles of the gods.
In Hindostan the ichneumon is not supposed to kill
the crocodile, though it is in the mouth of every old
woman that it possesses the knowledge of a remedy
against the bite of a poisonous snake, which its instinct
leads it to dig out of the ground; but this on dit has
never been ascertained to be true, and my belief is that
it is only based on the great agility and dexterity of the
greatest enemy end generally in the death of the snake,
which the neulah seizes by the back of the neck, and
after frequent onsets at last kills and eats, rejecting
nothing but the head.
After one of these battues my little daughter
happened to go to the fowl-house in the evening in
search of eggs, and was greatly startled by a melan-neulah. Eye-witnesses say that his battles with man's
choly squeaking which seemed to proceed from an old
rat-hole in one corner. Upon proper investigation this
was suspected to be the nest of one of the neulahs
which had suffered the last sentence of the law; but
how to get at the young we did not know, unless by
digging up the floor, and of this I did not approve. So
the little young ones would have perished but for a
childish freak of my young daughter. She seated her-
self before the nest, and imitated the cry of the
famished little animals so well that three wee, hairless,
blind creatures crept out, like newly-born rabbits, but
with long tails, in the hope of meeting with their lost
mamma.
Our hearts immediately warmed towards the little
helpless ones, and no one wished to wreak the sins of
the parents upon the orphans; and knowing that
neulahs were reared as pets, I proposed to my daughter
that she should select one for herself, and give the
others to two of my servants. My daughter's pro-
tégée, however, was the only one that survived under
its new régime; and Jumnie, as she called her nursling,
throve well, and soon attained its full size, knowing its
name, and endearing itself to everybody by its gambols
and tricks. She was like the most blithesome of little
kittens, and played with our fingers, and frolicked on
the sofas, sleeping occasionally behind one of the
cushions, and at other times coiling herself up in her
own little flannel bed.
In the course of time, however, Jumnie grew up to
maturity, being one year old, and formed an attach-
ment for one of her own race-a wild, roving bandit
of a neulah, who committed such deeds of atrocity in
the fowl-house as to compel us to take up arms again.
If she had only made her mistress the confidant of her
love!-but, alas! little did we suspect our neulah of a
companionship with thieves and assassins; and so,
leaving her, we thought, to her customary frolics, we
The colour of the Indian neulah is a grayish-brown;
but its chief beauty lies in its splendid squirrel-like
tail, and lively, prominent, dark-brown eyes. Like most
of the weasel kind, however, it has rather a disagreeable
odour; and if it were not for this there would not be a
sweeter pet in existence.
So far the experience of our Old Indian; and we now
turn to another authority on the highly-curious subject
just glanced at-the knowledge of the ichneumon of a
specific against the poison of the snake. Calder Camp-
bell, in his recent series of tales, 'Winter Nights'—and
capital amusement for such nights they are-describes
in almost a painfully truthful manner the adventure of
an officer in India, who was an eye-witness, under very
extraordinary circumstances, to the feat of the ichneu-
mon. The officer, through some accident, was wander-
ing on foot, and at night, through a desolate part of the
country, and at length, overcome with fatigue, threw
himself down on the dry, crisp spear-grass, and just as
the first faint edge of the dawn appeared, fell asleep.
'No doubt of it! I slept soundly, sweetly-no
doubt of it! I have never since then slept in the open
air either soundly or sweetly, for my awaking was full
of horror! Before I was fully awake, however, I had
a strange perception of danger, which tied me down to
the earth, warning me against all motion. I knew that
there was a shadow creeping over me, beneath which
to lie in dumb inaction was the wisest resource. I
felt that my lower extremities were being invaded by
the heavy coils of a living chain; but as if a providen-
tial opiate had been infused into my system, preventing
all movement of thew or sinew, I knew not till I was

wide awake that an enormous serpent covered the
whole of my nether limbs, up to the knees!
"My God! I am lost!" was the mental exclamation
I made, as every drop of blood in my veins seemed
turned to ice; and anon I shook like an aspen leaf,
until the very fear that my sudden palsy might rouse
the reptile, occasioned a revulsion of feeling, and I
again lay paralysed. It slept, or at all events remained
stirless; and how long it so remained I know not, for
time to the fear-struck is as the ring of eternity. All
at once the sky cleared up-the moon shone out-the
stars glanced over me: I could see them all, as I lay.
stretched on my side, one hand under my head, whence
I dared not remove it; neither dared I look downwards
at the loathsome bedfellow which my evil stars had
sent me.
'Unexpectedly, a new object of terror supervened:
a curious purring sound behind me, followed by two
smart taps on the ground, put the snake on the alert,
for it moved, and I felt that it was crawling upwards
to my breast. At that moment, when I was almost
maddened by insupportable apprehension into starting
up to meet perhaps certain destruction, something
sprang upon my shoulder-upon the reptile! There
was a shrill cry from the new assailant, a loud, appalling
hiss from the serpent. For an instant I could feel them
wrestling, as it were, on my body; in the next, they
were beside me on the turf; in another, a few paces
off, struggling, twisting round each other, fighting
furiously, I beheld them-a mungoos or ichneumon
and a cobra di capello!
'I started up; I watched that most singular combat,
for all was now clear as day. I saw them stand aloof
for a moment-the deep, venomous fascination of the
snaky glance powerless against the keen, quick, restless
orbs of its opponent: I saw this duel of the eye
exchange once more for closer conflict: I saw that the
mungoos was bitten; that it darted away, doubtless
in search of that still unknown plant whose juices are
its alleged antidote against snake-bite; that it returned
with fresh vigour to the attack; and then, glad sight!
I saw the cobra di capello, maimed from hooded head
to scaly tail, fall lifeless from its hitherto demi-erect
position with a baffled hiss; while the wonderful
victor, indulging itself in a series of leaps upon the
body of its antagonist, danced and bounded about,
purring and spitting like an enraged cat!
'Little, graceful creature! I have ever since kept a
pet mungoos-the most attached, the most playful, and
the most frog-devouring of all animals.'
Many other authors refer to the alleged antidote
against a snake-bite, known only to the ichneumon,
and there are about as many different opinions as there
are authors; but, on the whole, our Old Indian appears
to us to be on the strongest side.

THE FAR WEST.
The Far West,' where is the West, and what are its
bounds? But a few years have passed since our thriving
town (then a rude hamlet) stood upon the further con-
fines of the rising west. Still beyond there did indeed
exist an ideal realm of future greatness, a matted and
mighty forest; but clouds and thick darkness' rested on
it. But the solitude has been penetrated, the forest has
been overwhelmed by the towering wave of emigration.
That wave but recently spent its utmost fury ere it
reached even here, and its last and dying ripple was wont
to fall gently at our feet. But not so now it has risen
above, it has swept over us; and while its mighty deluge
is yet running past in one undiminished current, the roar
of its swelling surges, repeated by each babbling echo, is
still wafted back to us upon every western breeze. Ours
is no longer a western settlement; our children are
surrounded by the comforts, the blessings, and the
elegances of life, where their fathers found only hard-
ship, privation, want. The westward' is onward-still
onward-but where? Even the place that was known as
such but yesterday, to-morrow shall be known so no more.
The tall forest, the prowling beast, and
'The stole of the woods, the man without a tear,'
are alike borne down, trampled, and destroyed by this
everlasting scramble for the West.-Buffalo paper.

MYSTERY OF THE AMERICAN LAKES.
C.
Lake Erie is only sixty or seventy feet deep; but the
bottom of Lake Ontario, which is 452 feet deep, is 230
feet below the tide-level of the ocean, or as low as most
parts of the Gulf of St Lawrence; and the bottoms of
Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, although their
surface is so much higher, are all, from their vast depth,
on a level with the bottom of Lake Ontario. Now, as the
discharge through the river Detroit, after allowing for the
full probable portion carried off by evaporation, does not
appear by any means equal to the quantity of water
which the three upper great lakes receive, it has been
conjectured that a subterranean river may run from Lake
Superior to Huron, and from Huron to Lake Ontario.
This conjecture is by no means improbable, and will
account for the singular fact that salmon and herring are
caught in all the lakes communicating with the St
Lawrence, but in no others. As the Falls of Niagara
must have always existed, it would puzzle the naturalist
to say how these fish got into the upper lakes without
some such subterranean river; moreover, any periodical
obstruction of this river would furnish a not improbable
solution of the mysterious flux and reflux of the lakes.-

THE Rose had been becalmed for several days in Cowes
Harbour, and utterly at a loss how else to cheat the
time, I employed myself one afternoon in sauntering
up and down the quay, whistling for a breeze, and
listlessly watching the slow approach of a row-boat,
bringing the mail and a few passengers from South-
ampton, the packet-cutter to which the boat belonged
being as hopelessly immovable, except for such drift as
the tide gave her, as the Rose. The slowness of its
approach-for I expected a messenger with letters
added to my impatient weariness; and as, according to
my reckoning, it would be at least an hour before the
boat reached the landing-steps, I returned to the Foun-
tain Inn in the High Street, called for a glass of negus,
and as I lazily sipped it, once more turned over the
newspapers lying on the table, though with scarcely a
hope of coming athwart a line that I had not read half
a dozen times before. I was mistaken. There was a
'Cornwall Gazette' amongst them which I had not
before seen, and in one corner of it I lit upon this, to
me in all respects new and extremely interesting para-
graph:-'We copy the following statement from a con-
temporary, solely for the purpose of contradicting it
"It is said that the leader of the smugglers in the
late desperate affray with the coast-guard in St
Michael's Bay was no other than Mr George Polwhele
Hendrick, of Lostwithiel, formerly, as our readers are
aware, a lieutenant in the royal navy, and dismissed
the king's service by sentence of court-martial at the
close of the war." There is no foundation for this
imputation. Mrs Hendrick, of Lostwithiel, requests us
to state that her son, from whom she heard but about
ten days since, commands a first-class ship in the
merchant navy of the United States.'
I was exceedingly astonished. The court-martial I
had not heard of, and having never overhauled the Navy
List for such a purpose, the absence of the name of G. P.
Hendrick had escaped my notice. What could have
been his offence? Some hasty, passionate act, no
doubt; for of misbehaviour before the enemy, or of the
commission of deliberate wrong, it was impossible to
suspect him. He was, I personally knew, as eager as
flame in combat; and his frank, perhaps heedless gene-
rosity of temperament, was abundantly apparent to
every one acquainted with him. I had known him for
a short time only; but the few days of our acquaint-
ance were passed under circumstances which bring
out the true nature of a man more prominently and
unmistakably than might twenty years of hum-drum,
everyday life. The varnish of pretension falls quickly

off in presence of sudden and extreme peril-peril
especially requiring presence of mind and energy to
beat it back. It was in such a position that I recog-
nised some of the high qualities of Lieutenant Hen-
drick. The two sloops of war in which we respec-
tively served were consorts for awhile on the South
African coast, during which time we fell in with a
Franco-Italian privateer or pirate-for the distinction
between the two is much more technical than real. She
was to leeward when we sighted her, and not very
distant from the shore, and so quickly did she shoal
her water, that pursuit by either of the sloops was out
of the question. Being a stout vessel of her class, and
full of men, four boats-three of the Scorpion's and one
of her consort's-were detached in pursuit. The breeze
gradually failed, and we were fast coming up with our
friend when he vanished behind a headland, on rounding
which we found he had disappeared up a narrow, winding
river, of no great depth of water. We of course followed,
and after about a quarter of an hour's hard pull found,
on suddenly turning a sharp elbow of the stream, that
we had caught a Tartar. We had, in fact, come upon a
complete nest of privateers-a rendezvous or depôt they
termed it. The vessel was already anchored across the
channel, and we were flanked on each shore by a crowd
of desperadoes, well provided with small arms, and
with two or three pieces of light ordnance amongst
them. The shouts of defiance with which they greeted
us as we swept into the deadly trap were instantly
followed by a general and murderous discharge of both
musketry and artillery; and as the smoke cleared away
I saw that the leading pinnace, commanded by Hen-
drick, had been literally knocked to pieces, and that
the little living portion of the crew were splashing
about in the river.
There was time but for one look, for if we allowed
the rascals time to reload their guns our own fate
would inevitably be a similar one. The men under-
stood this, and with a loud cheer swept eagerly on
towards the privateer, whilst the two remaining boats
engaged the flanking shore forces, and I was soon
involved in about the fiercest mêlée I ever had the
honour to assist at. The furious struggle on the deck
of the privateer lasted but about five minutes only, at
the end of which all that remained of us were thrust
over the side. Some tumbled into the boat, others, like
myself, were pitched into the river. As soon as I came
to the surface, and had time to shake my ears and look
about me, I saw Lieutenant Hendrick, who, the instant
the pinnace he commanded was destroyed, had with
equal daring and presence of mind swam towards a
boat at the privateer's stern, cut the rope that held her
with the sword he carried between his teeth, and forth-

with began picking up his half-drowned boat's crew.
This was already accomplished, and he now performed
the same service for me and mine. This done, we again
sprang at our ugly customer, he at the bow, and I about
midships. Hendrick was the first to leap on the
enemy's deck; and so fierce and well-sustained was the
assault this time, that in less than ten minutes we were
undisputed victors so far as the vessel was concerned.
The fight on the shore continued obstinate and bloody,
and it was not till we had twice discharged the priva-
teer's guns amongst the desperate rascals that they
broke and fled. The dashing, yet cool and skilful
bravery evinced by Lieutenant Hendrick in this brief
but tumultuous and sanguinary affair was admiringly
remarked upon by all who witnessed it, few of whom,
whilst gazing at the sinewy, active form, the fine, pale,
flashing countenance, and the dark, thunderous eyes of
the young officer-if I may use such a term, for in
their calmest aspect a latent volcano appeared to
slumber in their gleaming depths- could refuse to
subscribe to the opinion of a distinguished admiral,
who more than once observed that there was no more
promising officer in the British naval service than
Lieutenant Hendrick.
Well, all this, which has taken me so many
words to relate, flashed before me like a scene in
a theatre, as I read the paragraph in the Cornish
paper. The Scorpion and her consort parted company
a few days after this fight, and I had not since
then seen or heard of Hendrick till now. I was
losing myself in conjectures as to the probable or pos-
sible cause of so disgraceful a termination to a career
that promised so brilliantly, when the striking of the
bar-clock warned me that the mail-boat was by this
time arrived. I sallied forth and reached the pier-
steps just a minute or so before the boat arrived
there. The messenger I expected was in her, and I
was turning away with the parcel he handed me,
when my attention was arrested by a stout, unwieldy
fellow, who stumbled awkwardly out of the boat, and
hurriedly came up the steps. The face of the man
was pale, thin, hatchet-shaped, and anxious, and the
gray, ferrety eyes were restless and perturbed; whilst
the stout, round body was that of a yeoman of the
bulkiest class, but so awkwardly made up that it did
not require any very lengthened scrutiny to perceive
that the shrunken carcass appropriate to such a lanky
and dismal visage occupied but a small space within
the thick casing of padding and extra garments in
which it was swathed. His light-brown wig, too, sur-
mounted by a broad-brimmer, had got a little awry,
dangerously revealing the scanty locks of iron-gray
beneath. It was not difficult to run up these little
items to a pretty accurate sum-total, and I had little
doubt that the hasting and nervous traveller was fleeing
either from a constable or a sheriff's officer. It was,
however, no affair of mine, and I was soon busy with
the letters just brought me.
The most important tidings they contained was that
Captain Pickard-the master of a smuggling craft of
some celebrity, called Les Trois Freres, in which for the
last twelve months or more he had been carrying on a
daring and successful trade throughout the whole line
of the southern and western coasts-was likely to be
found at this particular time near a particular spot in the
back of the Wight. This information was from a sure
source in the enemy's camp, and it was consequently
with great satisfaction that I observed indications of
the coming on of a breeze, and in all probability a stiff
I was not disappointed; and in less than an hour
the Rose was stretching her white wings beneath a
brisk north-wester over to Portsmouth, where I had
some slight official business to transact previous to
looking after friend Pickard. This was speedily des-
patched, and I was stepping into the boat on my
one.
return to the cutter when a panting messenger informed
me that the port-admiral desired to see me instantly.
'The telegraph has just announced,' said the admiral,
that Sparkes, the defaulter, who has for some time
successfully avoided capture, will attempt to leave the
kingdom from the Wight, as he is known to have been
in communication with some of the smuggling gentry
there. He is supposed to have a large amount of
government moneys in his possession; you will there-
fore, Lieutenant Warneford, exert yourself vigilantly
to secure him.'
'What is his description?'
'Mr James,' replied the admiral, addressing one of
the telegraph clerks, 'give Lieutenant Warneford the
description transmitted.' Mr James did so, and I read:
Is said to have disguised himself as a stout country-
man; wears a blue coat with bright buttons, buff
waistcoat, a brown wig, and a Quaker's hat. He is of
a slight, lanky figure, five feet nine inches in height.
He has two pock-marks on his forehead, and lisps in
his speech.'
'By Jove, sir,' I exclaimed, 'I saw this fellow only
about two hours ago!' I then briefly related what had
occurred, and was directed not to lose a moment in
hastening to secure the fugitive.
The wind had considerably increased by this time,
and the Rose was soon again off Cowes, where Mr
Roberts, the first mate, and six men, were sent on shore
with orders to make the best of his way to Bonchurch—
about which spot I knew, if anywhere, the brown-
wigged gentleman would endeavour to embark-whilst
the Rose went round to intercept him seaward; which
she did at a spanking rate, for it was now blowing half
a gale of wind. Evening had fallen before we reached
our destination, but so clear and bright with moon and
stars that distant objects were as visible as by day. I
had rightly guessed how it would be, for we had no
sooner opened up Bonchurch shore or beach than
Roberts signaled us that our man was on board the
cutter running off at about a league from us in the
direction of Cape La Hogue. I knew, too, from the
cutter's build, and the cut and set of her sails, that she
was no other than Captain Pickard's boasted craft, so
that there was a chance of killing two birds with one
stone. We evidently gained, though slowly, upon
Les Trois Frères; and this, after about a quarter of an
hour's run, appeared to be her captain's own opinion,
for he suddenly changed his course, and stood towards
the Channel Islands, in the hope, I doubted not, that I
should not follow him in such weather as was likely to
come on through the dangerous intricacies of the iron-
bound coast about Guernsey and the adjacent islets.
Master Pickard was mistaken; for knowing the ex-
treme probability of being led such a dance, I had
brought a pilot with me from Cowes, as well acquainted
with Channel navigation as the smuggler himself could
be. Les Trois Frères, it was soon evident, was now
upon her best point of sailing, and it was all we could
do to hold our own with her. This was vexations;
but the aspect of the heavens forbade me shewing
more canvas, greatly as I was tempted to do so.
It was lucky I did not. The stars were still shining
over our heads from an expanse of blue without a
cloud, and the full moon also as yet held her course
unobscured, but there had gathered round her a glitter-
ing halo-like ring, and away to windward huge masses
of black cloud, piled confusedly on each other, were
fast spreading over the heavens. The thick darkness
had spread over about half the visible sky, presenting
a singular contrast to the silver brightness of the other
portion, when suddenly a sheet of vivid flame broke
out of the blackness, instantly followed by deafening
explosions, as if a thousand cannons were bursting
immediately over our heads. At the same moment
the tempest came leaping and hissing along the white-
crested waves, and struck the Rose abeam with such

227
terrible force, that for one startling moment I doubted
if she would right again. It was a vain fear; and in a
second or two she was tearing through the water at a
tremendous rate. Les Trois Frères had not been so
lucky: she had carried away her topmast, and sustained
other damage; but so well and boldly was she handled,
and so perfectly under command appeared her crew,
that these accidents were, so far as it was possible to do
so, promptly repaired; and so little was she crippled in
comparative speed, that although it was clear enough,
after a time, that the Rose gained something on her, it
was so slowly that the issue of the chase continued
extremely doubtful. The race was an exciting one:
the Caskets, Alderney, were swiftly past, and at about
two o'clock in the morning we made the Guernsey
lights. We were by this time within a mile of Les
Trois Frères; and she, determined at all risks to get
rid of her pursuer, ventured upon passing through a
narrow opening between the small islets of Herm
and Jethon, abreast of Guernsey-the same passage, I
believe, by which Captain, afterwards Admiral Lord
Saumarez, escaped with his frigate from a French
squadron in the early days of the last war.
Fine and light as the night had again become, the
attempt, blowing as it did, was a perilous, and proved
to be a fatal one. Les Trois Frères struck upon a reef
on the side of Jethon-a rock with then but one poor
habitation upon it, which one might throw a biscuit
over; and by the time the Rose had brought up in
the Guernsey Roads, the smuggler, as far as could
be ascertained by our night-glasses, had entirely dis-
appeared. What had become of the crew and the impor-
tant passenger was the next point to be ascertained;
but although the wind had by this time somewhat
abated, it was not, under the pilot's advice, till near
eight o'clock that the Rose's boat, with myself and a
stout crew, pulled off for the scene of the catastrophe.
We needed not to have hurried ourselves. The half-
drowned smugglers, all but three of whom had escaped
with life, were in a truly sorry plight, every one of
them being more or less maimed, bruised, and bleeding.
Les Trois Frères had gone entirely to pieces, and as
there was no possible means of escape from the desolate
place, our arrival, with the supplies we brought, was
looked upon rather as a deliverance than otherwise.
To my inquiries respecting their passenger, the men
answered by saying he was in the house with the cap-
tain. I immediately proceeded thither, and found one
of the two rooms on the ground-floor occupied by four
or five of the worst injured of the contrabandists, and
the gentleman I was chiefly in pursuit of, Mr Samuel
Sparkes. There was no mistaking Mr Sparkes, not-
withstanding he had substituted the disguise of a
sailor for that of a jolly agriculturist.
'You are, I believe, sir, the Mr Samuel Sparkes for
whose presence certain personages in London are just
now rather anxious?'
His deathy face grew more corpse-like as I spoke,
but he nevertheless managed to stammer out: No;
Jamth Edward, thir.'
'At all events, that pretty lisp, and those two marks
on the forehead, belong to Samuel Sparkes, Esquire,
and you must be detained till you satisfactorily explain
how you came by them. Stevens, take this person into
close custody, and have him searched at once. And
now, gentlemen smugglers,' I continued, 'pray inform
me where I may see your renowned captain?'
6
'He is in the next room,' replied a decent-tongued
chap sitting near the fire; and he desired me to give
his compliments to Lieutenant Warneford, and say he
wished to see him alone.'
'Very civil and considerate, upon my word! In this
room, do you say?'
'Yes, sir; in that room.' I pushed open a rickety
door, and found myself in a dingy hole of a room, little
more than about a couple of yards square, at the further
side of which stood a lithe, sinewy man in a blue pea-
jacket, and with a fur-cap on his head. His back was
towards me; and as my entrance did not cause him to
change his position, I said: 'You are Captain Pickard,
I am informed?'
He swung sharply round as I spoke, threw off his
cap, and said briefly and sternly: Yes, Warneford, I
am Captain Pickard.'
The sudden unmasking of a loaded battery imme-
diately in my front could not have so confounded and
startled me as these words did, as they issued from the
lips of the man before me. The curling black hair, the
dark flashing eyes, the marble features, were those of
Lieutenant Hendrick-of the gallant seaman whose
vigorous arm I had seen turn the tide of battle against
desperate odds on the deck of the privateer!
'Hendrick!' I at length exclaimed, for the sudden
inrush of painful emotion choked my speech for a
time-' can it indeed be you?'
'Ay, truly, Warneford. The Hendrick of whom
Collingwood prophesied high things is fallen thus low;
and worse remains behind. There is a price set upon
my capture, as you know; and escape is, I take it, out
of the question.' I comprehended the slow, meaning
tone in which the last sentence was spoken, and the
keen glance that accompanied it. Hendrick, too,
instantly read the decisive though unspoken reply.
'I
'Of course it is out of the question,' he went on.
was but a fool to even seem to doubt it that it was.
You must do your duty, Warneford, I know; and
since this fatal mishap was to occur, I am glad for
many reasons that I have fallen into your hands.'
'So am not I; and I wish with all my soul you had
successfully threaded the passage you essayed.'
'The fellow who undertook to pilot us failed in
nerve at the critical moment. Had he not done so,
Les Trois Frères would have been long since beyond
your reach. But the past is past, and the future of
dark and bitter time will be swift and brief.'
'What have you especially to dread? I know a
reward has been offered for your apprehension, but not
for what precise offence.'
"The unfortunate business in St Michael's Bay.'
'Good God! The newspaper was right then! But
neither of the wounded men have died, I hear, so that
-that '-
"The mercy
of transportation may, you think, be sub-
stituted for the capital penalty.' He laughed bitterly.
'Or-or,' I hesitatingly suggested, 'you may not be
identified-that is, legally so.'
'Easily, easily, Warneford. I must not trust to
that rotten cable. Neither the coast-guard nor the
fellows with me know me indeed as Hendrick, ex-
lieutenant of the royal navy; and that is a secret you
will, I know, religiously respect.'
I promised to do so: the painful interview termi-
nated; and in about two hours the captain and sur-
viving crew of Les Trois Frères, and Mr Samuel
Sparkes, were safely on board the Rose. Hendrick had
papers to arrange; and as the security of his person
was all I was responsible for, he was accommodated in
my cabin, where I left him to confer with the Guernsey
authorities, in whose bailiwick Jethon is situated.
The matter of jurisdiction-the offences with which
the prisoners were charged having been committed in
England-was soon arranged; and by five o'clock in
the evening the Rose was on her way to England,
under an eight-knot breeze from the south-west.
As soon as we were fairly underweigh, I went below
to have a last conference with unfortunate Hendrick.
There was a parcel on the table directed to 'Mrs
Hendrick, Lostwithiel, Cornwall-care of Lieutenant
Warneford.' Placing it in my hands, he entreated me
to see it securely conveyed to its address unexamined
and unopened. I assured him that I would do so; and
tears, roughly dashed away, sprang to his eyes as he

grasped and shook my hand. I felt half-choked; and
when he again solemnly adjured me, under no circum-
stances, to disclose the identity of Captain Pickard and
Lieutenant Hendrick, I could only reply by a seaman's
hand-grip, requiring no additional pledge of words.
We sat silently down, and I ordered some wine to be
brought in. You promised to tell me,' I said, 'how
all this unhappy business came about.'
'I am about to do so,' he answered. It is an old
tale, of which the last black chapter owes its colour, let
me frankly own, to my own hot and impatient temper
as much as to a complication of adverse circumstances.'
He poured out a glass of wine, and proceeded at first
slowly and calmly, but gradually, as passion gathered
strength and way upon him, with flushed and impetuous
eagerness to the close:-
'I was born near Lostwithiel, Cornwall. My father,
a younger and needy son of no profession, died when I
was eight years of age. My mother has about eighty
pounds a year in her own right, and with that pittance,
helped by self-privation, unfelt because endured for her
darling boy, she gave me a sufficient education, and
fitted me out respectably; when, thanks to Pellew, I
obtained a midshipman's warrant in the British service.
This occurred in my sixteenth year. Dr Redstone, at
whose "High School" I acquired what slight classical
learning, long since forgotten, I once possessed, was
married in second nuptials to a virago of a wife, who
brought him, besides her precious self, a red-headed
cub by a former marriage. His, the son's, name was
Kershaw. The doctor had one child about my own
age, a daughter, Ellen Redstone. I am not about to
prate to you of the bread-and-butter sentiment of mere
children, nor of Ellen's wonderful graces of mind and
person: I doubt, indeed, if I thought her very pretty at
the time; but she was meekness itself, and my boy's
heart used, I well remember, to leap as if it would
burst my bosom at witnessing her patient submission
to the tyranny of her mother-in-law; and one of the
greatest pleasures I ever experienced was giving young
Kershaw, a much bigger fellow than myself, a good
thrashing for some brutality towards her an exploit
that of course rendered me a remarkable favourite with
the great bumpkin's mother.
'Well, I went to sea, and did not again see Ellen till
seven years afterwards, when, during absence on sick
leave, I met her at Penzance, in the neighbourhood of
which place the doctor had for some time resided. She
was vastly improved in person, but was still meek, dove-
eyed, gentle Ellen, and pretty nearly as much domi-
nated by her mother-in-law as formerly. Our child-
acquaintance was renewed; and, suffice it to say, that I
soon came to love her with a fervency surprising even
to myself. My affection was reciprocated: we pledged
faith with each other; and it was agreed that at the
close of the war, whenever that should be, we were to
marry, and dwell together like turtle-doves in the
pretty hermitage that Ellen's fancy loved to conjure
up, and with her voice of music untiringly dilate upon.
I was again at sea, and the answer to my first letter
brought the surprising intelligence that Mrs Redstone
had become quite reconciled to our future union, and
that I might consequently send my letters direct to the
High School. Ellen's letter was prettily expressed
enough, but somehow I did not like its tone. It did
not read like her spoken language at all events. This,
however, must, I concluded, be mere fancy; and our
correspondence continued for a couple of years-till the
peace in fact when the frigate, of which I was now
second-lieutenant, arrived at Plymouth to be paid off.
We were awaiting the admiral's inspection, which for
some reason or other was unusually delayed, when a
bag of letters was brought on board, with one for me
bearing the Penzance postmark. I tore it open, and
found that it was subscribed by an old and intimate
friend. He had accidentally met with Ellen Redstone |
for the first time since I left. She looked thin and ill,
and in answer to his persistent questioning, had told
him she had only heard once from me since I went to
sea, and that was to renounce our engagement; and
she added that she was going to be married in a day
or two to the Rev. Mr Williams, a dissenting minister
of fair means and respectable character. My friend
assured her there must be some mistake, but she shook
her head incredulously; and with eyes brimful of tears,
and shaking voice, bade him, when he saw me, say that
she freely forgave me, but that her heart was broken.
This was the substance, and as I read, a hurricane of
dismay and rage possessed me. There was not, I felt,
a moment to be lost. Unfortunately the captain was
absent, and the frigate temporarily under the command
of the first-lieutenant. You knew Lieutenant
'I did, for one of the most cold-blooded martinets that
ever trod a quarter-deck.'
'Well, him I sought, and asked temporary leave of
absence. He refused. I explained, hurriedly, implor-
ingly explained the circumstances in which I was
placed. He sneeringly replied, that sentimental non-
sense of that kind could not be permitted to interfere
with the king's service. You know, Warneford, how
naturally hot and impetuous is my temper, and at that
moment my brain seemed literally aflame: high words
followed, and in a transport of rage I struck the taunt-
ing coward a violent blow in the face-following up the
outrage by drawing my sword, and challenging him to
instant combat. You may guess the sequel. I was
immediately arrested by the guard, and tried a few
days afterwards by court-martial. Exmouth stood my
friend, or I know not what sentence might have been
passed, and I was dismissed the service.'
6
L
:
'I was laid up for several weeks by fever about that
time,' I remarked; and it thus happened, doubtless,
that I did not see any report of the trial.'
"The moment I was liberated I hastened, literally
almost in a state of madness, to Penzance. It was ´all
true, and I was too late! Ellen had been married
something more than a week. It was Kershaw and his
mother's doings. Him I half-killed; but it is need-
less to go into details of the frantic violence with which
I conducted myself. I broke madly into the presence
of the newly-married couple: Ellen swooned with
terror, and her husband, white with consternation, and
trembling in every limb, had barely, I remember, suffi
cient power to stammer out, "that he would pray for
me." The next six months is a blank. I went to
London; fell into evil courses, drank, gambled; heard
after awhile that Ellen was dead-the shock of which
partially checked my downward progress partially
only. I left off drinking, but not gambling, and ulti
mately I became connected with a number of disreput-
able persons, amongst whom was your prisoner Sparkes.
He found part of the capital with which I have been
carrying on the contraband trade for the last two years.
I had, however, fully determined to withdraw myself
from the dangerous though exciting pursuit. This
was to have been my last trip; but you know," he
added bitterly, it is always upon the last turn of the
dice that the devil wins his victim.'
1
He ceased speaking, and we both remained silent for
several minutes. What on my part could be said or
suggested?
You hinted just now,' I remarked after awhile,
that all your remaining property was in this parcel.
You have, however, of course reserved sufficient for
your defence?'
A strange smile curled his lip, and a wild, brief flash
of light broke from his dark eyes, as he answered:
O yes; more than enough-more, much more than
will be required.'
'I am glad of that. We were again silent, and I
presently exclaimed: Suppose we take a turn on
deck-the heat here stifles one."

With all my heart, he answered; and we both left ignorant of the sad fate of her son. It was her impres-
the cabin.
We continued to pace the deck side by side for some
time without interchanging a syllable. The night was
beautifully clear, and fine, and the cool breeze that
swept over the star and moon lit waters gradually
allayed the feverish nervousness which the unfortunate
lieutenant's narrative had excited.
A beautiful, however illusive world,' he by and by
sadly resumed, this Death-now so close at my heels
wrenches us from. And yet you and I, Warneford,
have seen men rush to encounter the King of Terrors,
as he is called, as readily as if summoned to a bridal.'.
A sense of duty and a habit of discipline will
always overpower, in men of our race and profession,
the vulgar fear of death.' {
Is it not also, think you, that the greater fear of
disgrace, dishonour in the eyes of the world, which
outweighs the lesser dread?? ི༑ ་ ་
I
No doubt that has an immense influence. What
would our sweethearts, sisters, mothers say if they
heard we had turned craven? What would they say in
England? Nelson well understood this feeling, and
appealed to it in his last great signal.'
Ay, to be sure,' he musingly replied; what
would our mothers say-feel rather at witnessing
their sons' dishonour? That is the master-chord.'
We once more relapsed into silence; and after an-
other dozen or so turns on the deck, Hendrick seated
himself on the combings of the main hatchway. His
countenance, I observed, was still pale as marble,
but a livelier, more resolute expression had gradually
kindled in his brilliant eyes. He was, I concluded,
nerving himself to meet the chances of his position
with constancy and fortitude.
6
I shall go below again,' I said. Come; it may be
some weeks before we have another glass of wine
together.'
I will be with you directly,' he answered, and I
went down. He did not, however, follow, and I was
about calling him, when I heard his step on the
stairs. He stopped at the threshold of the cabin,
and there was a flushing intensity of expression about
his face which quite startled me. As if moved by
second thoughts, he stepped in. 'One last glass with
you, Warneford: God bless you!' He drained and set
the glass on the table. The lights at the corner of
the Wight are just made,' he hurriedly went on. It is
not likely I shall have an opportunity of again speaking
with you; and let me again hear you say that you will

MONACHISM.
HISTORY is commonly said to be the most instructive
of all studies; but whether owing to the incompetence
of its teachers, or to the natural dulness of the appre-
hension of men, it is very difficult to be understood.
We take its examples as abstractions, without reference
to time or place, and try the fitness of one form of
civilisation by the principles of another form. What
was excellent in its acted time we think vicious because
inapplicable to ours; and thus we shut our eyes to the
character of those men or things by whose agency the
enlightenment of one generation was passed on to the
next. As an instance of this injustice we would men-
tion Monachism, or Monkery, a word much used in the
party polemics of the day-with which it has nothing
in the world to do--and always misused. Unacquainted
with the general history of monachism, it is usually
considered as a thing belonging exclusively to the
Roman Catholic Church; whereas it was of far more
ancient date, and may be said to have had its votaries
in almost every religion of the East.
Not to go further into the early history of this
remarkable institution than the period immediately
after the commencement of our era, it may be men-
tioned that the first Christian monks were solitaires
or hermits, who, disgusted with the growing irreligion
of the times, betook themselves to the desert to worship
God undisturbed by the passions of men. Here they
gradually entered into communities; and, as Gibbon
tells us, the philosophic eye of Pliny surveyed with
astonishment a solitary people who dwelt among the
palm-trees near the Dead Sea, who subsisted without
money, who were propagated without women, and who
derived from the disgust and repentance of mankind a
perpetual supply of voluntary associates.' Egypt was
overrun with colonies of monks; they swarmed on the
mountains and in the deserts to a number, as an old
author remarks, emulating the population of the towns.
The custom was soon introduced into Rome, where the
gentry, and, above all, the matrons, converted their
"God bless you!' he broke in, 'I must on deck houses into monasteries; but still numerous zealots,
again.'
He vanished as he spoke, and a dim suspicion of his
purpose arose in my mind; but before I could act upon
it, a loud, confused outcry arose on the deck, and as I
rushed up the cabin stairs, I heard, amidst the hurry-
ing to and fro of feet, the cries of Man overboard!'
" 'Bout ship!'-Down with the helm!' The cause
of the commotion was soon explained: Hendrick had
sprang overboard; and looking in the direction pointed
out by the man at the wheel, I plainly discerned him
already considerably astern of the cutter. His face
was turned towards us, and the instant I appeared he
waved one arm wildly in the air: I could hear the
words, 'Your promise!' distinctly, and the next instant
the moonlight played upon the spot where he had
vanished. Boats were lowered, and we passed and
repassed over and near the place for nearly half an
hour. Vainly he did not reappear!
I have only farther to add, that the parcel intrusted
to me was safely delivered, and that I have reason to
believe Mrs Hendrick remained to her last hour
scorning the comforts of civilised life, continued to fix
their abode in the wilderness. Here, however, they
were followed by the adulation of mankind, till hermits
were turned into saints and bishops.
The picture drawn by writers of the stamp of
Gibbon is uniformly repulsive. They attribute the
institution to motives either despicable or vicious, and
seem blind to the part it was destined to play in the
history of civilisation. But we cannot deny the credit
of earnestness to those who, on accepting a law of con-
duct, bound themselves, under the most terrible penal-
ties, to obedience; who abandoned entirely the pleasures
of sense; who dressed in the coarsest garb of the
country where they chanced to reside; and who satis-
fied their hunger with a scanty portion of the simplest
food, and their thirst with pure water. These necessaries
they earned by their daily toil in cultivating the fields,
manufacturing implements, and acting as servants to
one another. After the toilsome day, they lay down to
rest on the ground on a hard mat, and were disturbed
at midnight by a rustic horn calling them with its

abrupt but melancholy roar to their devotions. Their
original cells were low, narrow huts, disposed in regular
rows, and forming the streets of a monastic village
surrounded by walls. In Egypt the larger monasteries
contained 1500 or 1600 inhabitants, each thirty or forty
individuals composing a society of separate discipline
and diet.
So much for the more ancient monks; but the same
character and the same industry descended for many
generations; and in England we find them in the
middle ages turning the most sterile tracts into pro-
ductive lands, and giving a new aspect to the country.
Even abbots assisted in all sorts of rural labours,
ploughing, winnowing, and forging instruments of hus-
bandry at the anvil. Thomas à Becket, the haughtiest
of them all, was a hard worker; and after he be-
came Archbishop of Canterbury, was accustomed to
go into the fields to have a bout at reaping corn and
making hay. An abbot of Glastonbury in the thirteenth
century was a famous hand at repairing ploughs, and
at using them too. 'It must have been a pleasing
scene of rural industry,' says Mr Merryweather, 'the
labours of those busy monks, with two score ploughs at
work; with fields glorying in their abundant crops,
lands crowded with luscious fruits, and vines bending
beneath the weight of grapes; with droves of near nine
thousand head of cattle; fine fish-ponds, busy mills and
barns overflowing with gathered fruits. We cannot
accuse the monks of sloth, or entertain many fears that
poverty and starvation were heard to raise their
dismal cry at the gates of Glastonbury in vain.' By
such labours England came to be called 'a storehouse
of Ceres' from the abundance of its corn.
This labour, it must be remarked, was a religious as
well as a social duty. By the rules of St Benedict,
morning-work in the fields was enforced upon the
monks four hours from Easter till October, and
six hours from October to Lent; and after dinner
and a dessert of holy reading, they returned to
their out-of-door's labour. This may seem hard;
but the earlier monastic lands were a desert,
which it was the mission of the monks to reclaim.
'Experience taught the pilgrim to deviate from the
beaten path, and to gaze over such uninviting spots
for the curling smoke that betokened the presence
of the monks, and reminded him of their Christian
hospitality. Often, when least expected, but when
most desired, did the sound of the matin-bell, waft-
ing across a lonely moor, carry a welcome to his
sinking heart, and make him turn aside for a blessing
and a meal. Far removed from the habitations of
men, and thus shut out from all intercourse with the
world, the labour of the monks was as essential to
their own comfort as it was salutary in preventing
the growth of idleness among them. The marshes
near the monasteries were drained, and converted into
productive land. Such was the case at St Albans;
and in another place the lake now called Alresford
Pond was formed of these waste waters, and not only
gave large tracts of land for the use of man, but
rendered the river Itchin navigable to the very head.
But the monks were not satisfied with works of
utility. They were the men of taste of the times, and
set themselves to adorn the wilderness they had re-
claimed, until
'The desert smiled,
And paradise was opened on the wild.'
They surrounded their monasteries with gardens,
orchards, and plantations, perfumed them with flowers
and shrubs, and grew herbs and vegetables, which few
of the laity were acquainted with. Vineyards were
attached to almost all the monasteries; and in some
wine was so abundant that the supply was ascribed to

miracle! This was the case when King Edgar dined
with the Abbot Ethelwold at Abingdon, bringing with
him a crowd of the Northumbrian nobility. The king
drank like a lord, and the lords were as merry over
their cups as kings; but still there was no stint. The
wine came at their call like an endless flood; and the
debauch was kept up till night, when the guests
departed rejoicing. They were assured that the barrels
of the poor monks had contained originally but very
little, the rest being a miraculous gift of the patron
saint.
It may easily be supposed that the reclaimed desert
was not long of finding a population. The monks at
first built houses for the serfs and other dependents
who assisted them in their labours, and thus was
formed the nucleus of a town. St Egwin, for example,
established himself in the middle of a dense forest; and
clearing away the thorns and brambles, constructed his
monastery - -now the flourishing town of Evesham.
But the history of Croyland Abbey is still more
remarkable. St Guthlac chose the most wretched spot
in Lincolnshire when he resolved to dedicate his life to
God. An old manuscript describes the loathsomeness
of the place. "It was," says the writer, "surrounded
with crooked and winding rivers and swampy fens;
sometimes the air was filled with dark and nauseous
vapours; it abounded with black troops of unclean
spirits, which crept under the door of his cell, and
through every chink or hole in the slender habitation:
they came out of the earth and filled the sky with
darkness." As years rolled by, this little oratory of
wood disappeared, and a monastery of stone was raised
amidst that dismal fen to the honour of St Guthlac.
Croyland Abbey gained fresh possessions with each
succeeding abbot; and Egelric, in the time of Edward
the Confessor, converted much of the waste lands of
the fen to a profitable use: he drained and afterwards
ploughed them. "In the dry years," says Ingulphus,
"he tilled the fens, and had an increase of an hundred-
fold for all the seed he sowed; and the monastery was
so increased by the abundant crops, that the poor of
the country were supplied therewith, which attracted
such a multitude of people that Croyland became a large
town." The abbots of St Albans, as an inducement to
settlers, gave them materials and money; and when a
town began to rise, laid out and decorated a market-
place, and erected a church at each entrance.
But a
town without access would have been of little use.
"The road to London," says Matthew Paris, "called
Watling Street and the Royal Way, as well as all
the parts of the Chiltern, being covered with thick
woods and groves, was become a refuge for all sorts of
wild beasts-such as wolves, wild boars, stags, and bulls;
and was also a harbour for thieves and outlaws, to the
imminent peril of the passengers and wayfarers." The
worthy abbot had some of the wood cut down, rough
places levelled, bridges built, and the road made firm
and passable; and for the better protection of travellers,
he entered into an engagement with a valiant knight,
named Thurnoth, to maintain a regular guard upon
this road; to scour those parts infested with thieves,
and to defend the highway in times of war; for which
services the abbot granted to the knight certain lands
and revenues.'
At a time when roads were in such a state, and when
travelling was so difficult and dangerous, the social
advancement of the people would have been impossible
without the monasteries to serve as points d'appui of
civilisation. They were inns, hospitals, and refuges
for the destitute, in one. Hospitality was a religious
duty, and a parsimonious monk was reckoned a dis-
grace to his order. In dearth and famine, in pestilence
and war, the monasteries were crowded with the poor
and infirm: their money, their plate, even the orna-
ments of their shrines, were sold to provide the means
of their charitable housekeeping; and when nothing

more remained, the very house itself was mortgaged to
the Jews. To convey an idea of the costly liberality
of the monks, Mr Merryweather tells us that at the
Abbey of St Albans every traveller who came to the
gate was entertained for three days; and at the Priory
of St Thomas of Canterbury, the great hall, or hospitium,
for the accommodation of pilgrims and poor travellers,
was 150 feet long and 40 feet broad.
manners.
The correspondence of the monks in these dark ages
linked the parts of the world together, and kept up the
level of intelligence. Abbot corresponded with abbot
throughout Christendom; and the letters being pre-
served in the archives of the monasteries, many of them
are extant to this day, and present a curious picture of
The pilgrim, too, played his part in aid of
· our own correspondent;' and from the stores of both
the industrious brethren compiled the chronicles which
are the only histories of the time. The monks, like-
wise, stood instead of the printers of a later era: they
multiplied copies of books with their pen; and even
Gibbon confesses that to their earlier brethren in the
convents of the East we owe the preservation of many
of the classics. The annual fairs brought letters from
all parts of the country, and these fairs were under the
jurisdiction of the monks, who derived from them a
portion of their revenues.
Mr Merryweather gives many instances of elegant
scholarship among the monks; but their skill in
mechanical science is less known, although it appeared
so wonderful to their age that it was usually ascribed to
the black art. When Gerbert constructed a hydraulic
organ, the people, who fell down with terror, thought
they heard the voice of the devil. St Dunstan was
not the fanatic monkish historians have maliciously
represented him. He was a great experimental philo-
sopher for his time; he was an ingenious mechanic, an
elegant musician, an expert scribe, and a tasteful
artist. In the times of John of Glastonbury, about the
year 1400, many proofs of his skill existed in the Abbey
of Glastonbury; and his biographer says that he could
make or model anything in gold, silver, brass, and iron.'
Dunstan was likewise the inventor of the Eolian harp,
whose music was of course preternatural, and brought
upon him a sentence of banishment from the court
as a necromancer. Another monk, Oliver of Malmes-
bury, made experiments in the art of flying, and per-
formed the distance of a furlong, but then fell to the
ground, and lamed himself for life. The accident,
however, did not diminish his faith in the new science:
he ascribed it solely to his having forgotten to provide
himself with a tail. Other better-known names will
suggest themselves, such as Michael Scott and Bacon,
who belonged to the thirteenth century. The latter
assumed the gray tunic of the Franciscan order, chiefly
for the sake of the books and the tranquillity of the
cloister; a tranquillity-no doubt from its being com-
posed of ease and alternate labour'-so favourable to
longevity, that we continually read of Saxon monks
upwards of 100 years old, and of some of 125, one of
142, and one of 163.

The monks were the chief medical practitioners, and
it is no wonder that many of their cures were esteemed
miraculous, since they were the result of implicit faith.
On this subject Roger Bacon, in his discourse on Art
and Nature,' is very plain. Physicians use figures
and charms," he writes, "knowing that the raising of
the imagination is of great efficacy in curing diseases
of the body: raising the soul from impurity to health,
by joy and confidence, is done by charms, for they
induce the patient to receive the medicine with greater
faith. They excite courage, more liberal confidence,
and hope. The physician, then, who would magnify
his cure, must devise some way of exciting faith in his
patient; not that thereby he would cheat, but that he
may stir up the imagination of the patient to believe he
will recover." This philosophic monk also believed in
6
an invisible fluid which gave men power over other
objects - the mesmeric force of the present day.
Magnetisers affirm,' says Mr Merryweather, that
those most susceptible of the mesmeric influence, as
well as the most capable of effecting it, are the high
nervous temperaments. It has been found, too, that
spare diet and long fasting have strengthened the power
of the mesmeric operator, and a strict continence of the
body is a grand auxiliary to success. Who then bore
the marks of such a temperament, or who then so
encouraged it, by his peculiar living, as the monk of
old? His days spent in deep study, in devotion, in
penance, and long fasting; his nights in prayer and
religious grief. Was not this a training to make a
mesmerist, and to render the nervous system suscep-
tible to the slightest touch? Have we not in such a
being the very attributes of a successful magnetiser?
And is it so very unreasonable to think the monk
might have practised as supernatural what science has
shewn to be a natural, although as yet an undefinable
power?'
Such was monachism as an agent of civilisation;
and, like other agents, when its work was finished, it
was of no farther use. The wealth it created robbed
it of its original character. The abbots became great
lords, and the monks grew lazy, fat, and licentious.
The illumination it had spread shewed the deformities
of a system no longer applicable to the state of society;
and at the Reformation the monk Luther shivered the
superannuated colossus into fragments, of which here
and there portions still remain as monuments of the
olden time. Let us not despise monachism because its
mission is accomplished. Let us look at it as a great
historical fact, and give it the honour it deserves.
The convents of the present world have nothing but
the name in common with the monasteries of the dark
ages; and those solitary apostles who take up their
abode in savage lands, to spread industry, refinement,
and religion throughout the wilderness-they alone are
the legitimate descendants of the monks of old.
INVISIBLE VEGETATION.
IN revelling in the glorious splendours of the vegetable
world at a season when every tree and flower is in per-
fection, one is apt to forget or overlook the world of
invisible vegetation which, though unseen and unheeded
by man, is yet in full and active operation around us,
and which, when investigated by the aid of artificial
vision, presents a field of contemplation as varied and
wondrous, though perhaps not so gorgeous, as the visible
display of green foliage and blossoms of every tint and
shade of brilliant colour which sparkle in the summer
sun. There is something exceedingly interesting in
tracing nature to her ultimate and simplest forms.
The mind of man has a natural craving for the infinite.
It delights to speculate either on the vast or the minute;
and we are not surprised at the expression of Linnæus,
that nature appeared to him 'greatest in her least
productions.'
One is delighted in a summer evening in a walk
amidst the dense, shaded woods to pick up a large,
beautiful fern, to examine its frond, curiously and
most symmetrically composed of numerous pairs of side
leaflets, and turning over them, to find their under sides
thickly covered with double rows of spores or seeds,
the germ from whence in due season are to spring up
other ferns of a like kind: or in wandering by the
cool margin of the sandy sea-beach, to pick up the huge
sea-tang (laminaria)—which the ocean waves have torn
up from its rocky station in the deep sea, and thus cast
ashore to wither and die-with all its accompanying
parasites of little shell- molluscs, sea-worms, and
zoophytes. All these are as interesting as even the
contemplation of the great and venerable oak of the
forest. Yet when we return home, and turn the

microscope to various objects then within our reach,
we shall find that there are forms and living things to
be seen there as intensely interesting, and as sug-
gestive of thought, as any we have seen in the wider
field of nature out of doors.
Take, for instance, a little stale vinegar which has
been exposed for some time to the air; or a solution
of sugar in water of eight or ten days' standing; or,
according to Schleiden, some bruised currant - juice
mixed with sugar, and strained through blotting-paper,
and allowed to stand for a day or two. If a drop of
the muddy or filmy part of these fluids be examined
under the microscope, minute granular bodies will
be first perceived; these grains or little globules will
in another day have enlarged, assuming now the
form of rounded cells; several of these cells join
together, and after another day a minute, fibrous
looking body, like a small bit of feathery down, will be
visible floating along in the fluid drop: this is the
famed vinegar-plant, or fermentation fungus. In a
little time other similar forms make their appearance,
till the fermenting fluid becomes studded over with
opaque, muddy-like spots. If this fluid is still kept
exposed to the air, these little floating islands; as it
were, will soon be observed to enlarge, and to acquire
other inhabitants. Minute living creatures like eels
will be seen in full activity darting through the
vegetable meshes. Other minute, but more decided
vegetable forms, as confervæ, may perhaps choose to
take up here their abodes; and, besides the vinegar-
eels, animalcules of other families-as the volcox, the
wheel-animal, and numerous monads-may be seen to
swarm and disport around the shores, and in the little
central lagoons of the floating islands. When we
reflect, however, that those islands cannot be more than
a line, or one-tenth of an inch in diameter, and that
perhaps within the whole area of the drop of fluid
under examination there are not less than some hun-
dreds of vegetable forms, and from two to three
millions of animals- the imagination is almost lost
in the conception of such extreme minuteness. Yet
we must by no means be incredulous, for we have
at hand more palpable, though still very minute
analogies to the primitive vegetation which we have
just been describing.
If, during the warm summer weather, we put aside
a bit of bread, or a slice of apple, pear, melon, or
other fruit, or a turnip or potato peeling, if nothing
better is at hand, we shall find, in a few days, all
those substances will have assumed a mouldy appear-
ance. Take a little of this mould gently off on the
point of a penknife, and subject it to the micro-
scope: you see in the moulded bread a grove of tall
stalks, each with a round head slightly flattened; in
short, a mushroom in miniature. This is the Mucor
mucedo, the fungus of the bread-mould. While fresh
and young they are of a beautiful milk-white colour;
gradually they assume a yellowish tinge. The stalks
are so transparent as, under a good magnifying power,
to shew the cellular structure inside; the bulb now
also exhibits, under a thin bark or skin, a number of
minute circular bodies all arranged in a compact form:
these are the spores or seeds. After a day or two
more the fungi begin to ripen and assume a brownish
tint, the bulbs blacken, the skin bursts, and innumer-
able spores are scattered about, many floating away in
the air. This forest of mould, like larger ones, is liable
to accidents: you may see in one corner, for instance,
that the bit of bread forming the soil has cracked; thus
a fungus has been loosened at the root, and it falls
down, we may suppose with a crash, though we still
desiderate instruments to magnify and make audible
the sound. Nevertheless the effects of the fall are
visible in the breaking down of neighbouring stems,
and in the premature scattering of the seeds. You
may see, too, sometimes the scattered seeds collect
upon one or two plants, and, enveloping them entirely,
destroy their vitality, and thus cause old, rotten-looking
stumps. If you attempt to tear up a plant its roots
cause a sensible resistance. A little water dropped
into the centre of this grove will in due time clear away
a portion of the plants and cause a lake; and this lake
will be found very soon tenanted by living creatures.
The largest tree of this forest may be about half at
line, or the twentieth of an inch high. The apple or
pea fungi attain the great height of even three lines.
In each head of seed there is generally a million of
spores. Ten thousand millions of these seeds might be,
and very often are, dancing about in the air-currents
of our apartments, though totally invisible to us; but
could we sufficiently magnify them as a sunbeam darted
in at our windows and illuminated their bodies, they
would appear like so many cannon-balls moving rapidly
up and down, and in all manner of directions. Unlike
the higher species of plants, these minute fungi do not
pay exclusive homage to the sun. While all the aris-
tocratic families of roses, tulips, sun-flowers, passion-
flowers, magnolias, wait upon his beams, and twist
and turn towards them, and live but in his smiles,
the mould fungi delight in dark closets, damp, half-
shut drawers, or shaded nooks and corners. Neither
do they disturb themselves nor deign to turn towards
his beams at all; they continue to shoot out perpen-
dicularly, horizontally, or even reversed, just as the.
surface from whence they spring happens to be directed.
No loyal pea or bean, or seed of barley or wheat, when
germinating in the ground, fails to raise its head aloft
and spread out its leaves and blossoms to the light and
day; but the bread-mould points its stalk and its
seed-vessel just as readily downwards to the earth as
upwards from it. Give these fungi, then, moisture,
air, and warmth, and they seem to care little about
light-that agency so essential for stimulating and
carrying on the vital operations of all the higher orders
of vegetables.
The bread-mould we liave compared to mushrooms:
the various kinds of fruit-mould are of a somewhat
higher order: they imitate mosses in a degree of arbo-
rescence, in roots which spread into the soil, in rudi-
ments of leaves or rather fronds, and in a greenish
verdure which the others want. The mould of the
apple differs from that of the pear, and both from the
mould of the lemon and orange; the parasites of different
families of plants thus differing from each other just as
is the case with the animated parasites of animals. But
animated beings have their vegetable parasites too. A
fungus has been detected growing from the body of the
common blue-bottle fly; minute fungi have been found
in the human lungs; and a peculiar fungus grows from
the skin of the human corpse.
The
The snow-plant (Protococcus nivalis) is a minute red
cell fungus, which is frequently seen in large clusters
on the surface of snow, or incrusting bare rocks on the
Alpine mountains of Europe. Another minute red
fungus (Trichodesmium Ehrenbergii) has been described
by Ehrenberg as seen at certain seasons of the year
covering large portions of the surface of the Red Sea;
and when the sun shines on it, imparting that red tinge,
compared to mahogany sawdust, which has probably
given the name to that celebrated inland sea.
appearance of this vegetable in immense quantities on
the surface of the water is very sudden, and its duration
transient. On the 8th July 1843,' writes M. Dupont,
I entered the Red Sea by the Strait of Babelmandel. On
that day the sands were white, the reefs of coral were
white also; the sea was of the most beautiful cerulean
blue. On awakening on the morning of the 15th of the
same month, what was my surprise to behold the sca
tinted with red as far as the eye could reach. Behind.

phenomenon. The whole surface of the water was

of a matter of a fine texture, apparently like brick-
powder mixed with rouge, or what fine sawdust of
mahogany would exhibit. On examination it proved
to be a minute cryptogamic plant. This redness con-
tinued till noon of the 16th, when it disappeared, and
the surface of the sea became blue as before.'
We have seen that all these forms of vegetation,
excessively minute and simple in structure as they are,
yet obey the great law of nature in propagating their
kinds. Millions of their invisible seeds are constantly
floating in the air, or swimming in the water, or lie
amid the dust and sand of the soil, ever ready to spring
up when the circumstances favourable for their germi
nation and development are present; and thus we need
not wonder at their ready appearance in almost all
fluids and in all localities; nor need we be led to the
supposition which once prevailed, before their natures
and habits were so well understood, that they sprung
up spontaneously, without seed or germ, from the
Undoubtedly they are most commonly found in the
products of animal or vegetable fermentation and
decomposition, just because these matters afford them
the chief conditions of vegetable growth—that is, food,
moisture, and warmth. Spallanzani long ago shewed
that by sowing a quantity of the black dust or spores
of bread-mould on a piece of bread, he had a quicker
growth and more plentiful crop of fungi than when the
bread was left to a natural or chance supply of seeds;
just as the husbandmån has a surer crop of wheat when
he deposits a sufficient quantity of seeds than when he
leaves the chance of a crop to the shake of the previous
autumn. More recent and careful experiments by
Professor Schulze have also shewn that if due care be
taken to get quit of the ova of animals and the seeds of
minute vegetables from any fluid, and at the same
time carefully to exclude the further entrance of
them through the admitted air, no traces of animal or
vegetable life will be manifest.
soil, or from substances in a state of fermentation.
What purpose, then, does this profusion of minute
and almost invisible organic existences subserve in the
great economy of nature, for nothing can have been
made by the Great Creator of the world in vain?
What is the use of those countless and almost incon-
ceivable myriads of vegetables and animalcules, living,
dying, and again reproduced in the most rapid succes-
sion, and all unseen and unmarked by the ordinary
senses of man? They are evidently the advanced guard,
the great pioneers of nature, the sappers and miners of
the vast armies of the organic kingdoms. Inorganic
matters-rocks, stones, the hard flints and limestones,
even the obdurate iron-have to be invaded and
rendered into impalpable atoms; the bland and inert
fluid water, and the various impalpable gases, have
all to be decomposed and moulded into new forms
and into matters having new properties. All this,
in the first instance, is the work of vegetables;
the simpler kinds working and slaving for the more
complicated-the minuter accumulating by the mere
force of untold numbers food for the larger and more
complicated. Before we can have the wheat grain
which furnishes our morning roll, millions on millions
of fungi and confervæ, of lichens and mosses, must
have been at work preparing a suitable soil for the
more delicate and noble cereal. Before the solitary
student can read these pages at his well-trimmed
midnight lamp, myriads of animalcules that feed on
the particles of vegetable origin dissolved in the
waters of the ocean, must feed the meduse that
feed the whale, whose sperm-oil feeds and sustains
that midnight taper. Millions on millions of tons of
minute organic particles that are every day and every
hour, by a process of decomposition, fast hastening
downwards again to join the mineral kingdom of inert
chaos and dark night, are constantly being rescued by
the roots and pores of some minute vegetables, or the
maws of some hungry animalcules, and again carried
for use into the great vortex of life. And thus it ever
is in our ceaseless round of existence: all nature is
connected by links of a great chain; and one of those
links, diminutive as it is, but which could not be wanted
in its proper place, is the microscopic plant.
'AN HONEST PENNY.'
Ir is interesting to remark the various shifts and con-
trivances, the resorts of a very humble species of
ingenuity, to which some of the right-minded poor by
whom we are surrounded have recourse in order to
procure what they proudly and independently term
'an honest penny.' It is gratifying to know that there
is a very large section of the lowest ranks to whom the
feeling of dependence upon others and the practices of
dishonesty are equally hateful and repugnant; and it
is impossible not to sympathise with the persevering
endeavours of many of this class whom society seems,
from some accident or other, to have pushed aside from
the beaten paths of labour and its deserved emoluments;
and who are left to make their way in the world in the
strict and literal sense of the term-seeing that they
have first to invent a calling before they can pursue it.
How much physical energy and good moral determi-
nation some of them bring to bear upon this praise-
worthy undertaking the following brief sketches, drawn
from the life, may assist in shewing.
"
,
Terence O'Donough is an Irishman whom a for-
tunate fate has united to an English wife. When I
first knew Terry he was in the enviable position of a
hanger-on at the underground warehouse of a small
printing-office, where two or three minor monthly
publications were rolled off from a machine in a cellar,
the motive-power of which was supplied by a steam-
engine in an adjoining factory. Terry's whole fortune
consisted in his wife, who plied as a basket-woman in
Covent Garden, and his own broad back, which he
carried steadily under the pressure of three hundred-
weight; to which might be added a temper insensible
to provocation, and an appetite which, owing to 'his
riverence, Father Matthew,' who had cured him of
whisky-drinking, was a match for anything eatable
under the sun. Terry's wife, whom he always addressed
asme darlint,' was in every respect the dacent ooman'
he was fond of calling her; and she was not a little proud
of her Herculean spouse, as anybody might see who
observed her watching him as he devoured the monstrous
boiling of potatoes which she brought him regularly
at one o'clock, and which, with a draught of water
from the pump in the courtyard, constituted his
unvarying dinner. I question if the good woman her-
self lived upon anything better: it was Terry's boast
that he had made her, like himself, a 'taytotalman
intirely,' and that 'iver since, wi' the blessin' of iven,
they hadn't wanted for nothin' at all at all.' Terry
had no regular engagement; his earnings were limited
to fetchings and carryings, and running of errands; and
when he had nothing to do he had nothing to receive.
His average receipts were rather under than over a
pound a month; and his wife, according to his own
account, which I believe was the true one, earned about
half as much; but she made his home comfortable to
him; kept his little garret as 'clane as the blue sky;'
and if Terry had any wish in the world, you may be
sure the image of his wife was shut up in the centre
of it.

And, to tell the truth, Terry had his wishes; and
they were, like those of all honest hard workers-for
constant employment, and a larger income. How to
bring about their realisation was the question. An
untaught Irishman, bred in the bogs of Connaught,
without education and without a calling, what could
he do to improve his condition? There was no
human rival whom he could supplant by superior
qualifications. Even the little printer's devils, who
gallopped up and down stairs, and ran about the
warehouse, had all got the larnin', and could rade a
printed book out and out,' while he did not know 'sor-
row a letther.' "Tisn't the larnin' will do my business
anyhow,' said he to himself. Bedad, if I was but a
stame-ingin, it's a pound a week they'd be afther givin'
me. Arrah now! that's what I call a diskivery. Sure
I'll be the stame - ingin, and do it half-price, if the
masther will ounly hear rayson!' So Terry watched
his opportunity, and one day when the steam ran short,
as it invariably did on the Saturday, he boldly volun-
teered to supersede the steam-engine if the masther
would put a handle to the mill,' and drive it clean
through the week for a less sum than he paid to the
proprietor of the steam. Terry's proposition was at
first laughed at as absurd, as the power required was
considered far too great for one man to supply
continuously. Repeated defalcations, however, on the
part of Terry's rival, the steam-engine, at length
induced the printer to listen to his offer. A handle
was fitted to the machine, and Terry was offered
half-a-crown a day for keeping it going. The experi-
ment succeeded admirably. The contest between flesh
and blood, bones and sinews, on the one side, and
cast-iron on the other, was for once decided in favour
of the former. The snorting, fire-eating rival was
cashiered, and sent about his proper business; and
from that day to this the arms of Terence O'Donough,
with some occasional assistance from his wife, have
supplied the motive-power to the printing-machine in
Court. From long practice Terry now makes
comparatively light work of his ponderous task.
During the hot summer weather his wife makes her
appearance in the afternoon, and laying hold of the
same handle, proves herself a worthy helpmate to her
toiling spouse. More than once have I seen Terry fast
asleep on the floor, after working half the night, while
his wife, grinding away, kept the concern going at the
accustomed pace. The steam-proprietor is the only
loser by the bargain; Terry's employer saves 20 per
cent. by the exchange; Terry himself has trebled his
earnings; and both he and his wife are confidently
looking forward to the accumulation of sufficient
capital for a start in the general line,' including
'murphies and black diamonds,' which is to lead them
onwards and upwards to respectability and fortune.
Returning lately from a visit to the Principality, I
arrived by the Great Western Railway at the Pad-
dington terminus. Throwing my portmanteau on the
top of an omnibus bound for the Bank, I mounted myself
by the side of it, and in a few minutes we were
en route for the city. We had not yet entered upon
the New Road ere I became aware that the omnibus,
which was crowned with luggage, was accompanied
on its journey by no less than six young lads, the
eldest not above seventeen, who, running at the
side or in the rear of the vehicle, kept up with it
the whole way.
I noticed that if one of them
caught my eye, he made a motion of touching his
hat-though not a semblance of a hat or of a
shoe either was to be found among the whole party
and executed a kind of shambling bow, which, being
performed at the speed of six or seven miles an
hour, appeared a rather comic species of politeness. I
asked the driver the meaning of this curious cortège.
"Them poor young 'uns, sir,' said he, 'is arnin' what I
calls a reg'lar hard penny. They are a-looking out
arter the luggage; and because they runs it down all
the way from the railway, they thinks they got a right
to the porterage. When we drops a passenger and a

man (they goes in reg'lar turns) will shoulder the
luggage, and pocket the browns for carrin' of it home.
He as has the last turn will have to run perhaps all
the way to the Bank-a good four mile the way we
go. They gits what they can, and takes their chance
whatever it is. Sometimes they're done altogether.
A boy may foller the 'bus all the way on the hunt
arter a gentleman's luggage, and never git it at last-
'cause why, d'ye see, a cab may take it out of his
mouth, or a kind-hearted swell may think that a chap
as will run four miles arter a trunk is perhaps likely
to bolt with it when he's got it. "Tis all a chance. I
wish 'em better luck, that's all.' 'A hard penny
indeed,' thought I; ' and a proof that these poor, ragged
vagabonds are willing at anyrate to get one honestly if
they can.'
The first passenger with luggage got out at Totten-
ham Court Road; his baggage was hauled from the
roof and lifted upon the shoulders of one of our
running attendants by the conductor, who seemed to
look upon
the ceremony as a matter of course. Away
marched the little bare-legged Atlas at the heels of the
passenger towards the Hampstead Road, and the
omnibus proceeded on its route accompanied by the
remaining five. The next stoppage was at Euston
Square; and the porterage, being only from the omnibus
to the North-Western Railway station, was but a two-
penny job. At King's Cross we discharged another
Angel, Islington, two more disappeared; and the
passenger, and lost another ragged attendant. At the
vehicle, on the roof of which my own was the only
remaining luggage, proceeded onwards to the Bank.
Onward at its side, with bare feet padding the dusty
road, now at the rate of nearly eight miles an hour,
came a flaxen-headed, country lad of fourteen, now and
then scanning my face with eager glances, and pulling
in the wind. When at length we stopped at the Bank,
an obeisance at his straggling locks as they fluttered
the little fellow had to fight for the possession of the
portmanteau, which he did with a vigour almost
amounting to desperation, with a half-drunken porter
of forty, who was standing on the look-out. Finding
himself likely to be worsted in the contest, he appealed
to me with a look which a flint could not have resisted,
and I felt myself compelled to interfere to procure him
tention to Paternoster Row for 4d., after having run
the job. He volunteered to carry the object of con-
at least four miles in a broiling sun to make sure of
the commission. He kept close to my side, as though
fearful of incurring suspicion, either by going too fast
or by lagging behind, and civilly bore the burden up
stairs to the second landing before holding out his hand
for payment. In answer to my questions, he told me
that he should immediately start back again by the
shortest cut to Paddington, there being no chance of a
job by the return journey. He said he could get back
in forty-five minutes in a direct line without much
running, and that they could do three journeys a day.
A good day was worth 1s. 3d. or 1s. 4d., a bad one, 8d.
or 9d. He thought he made about 5s. a week out of it,
but it was very hard work, and his victuals cost him
all he got, except 6d. for lodging. He added that it
would never do to run in shoes or boots-the gains
would all go in leather: 'the sole of a shoe wears out

in no time when a boy's a runnin' all day long, while
the sole of a fellar's foot only gits the thicker for it.'
His time was too fully occupied to allow of much
questioning; and having received his coin, he was off
westward like a shot, to rejoin his comrades at the
railway terminus.
These poor fellows work in bands, and find their
security in sticking closely to each other. It is only
when one is left alone at the end of a journey that a
stationary porter has a chance against them. Together
they would infallibly chase away any interloper who
should presume to attempt to bag the game which they
had conjointly hunted down. There is no doubt that
they rely a great deal, as they have reason to do, upon
the sympathy of the passengers, some of whom find no
small amusement in the race so pertinaciously main-
tained for the chance of a trifling reward. I am not
sorry to observe that since the increase of employment
for all classes which has arisen from the impetus of the
Great Exhibition, their numbers have been materially
thinned. They have been in some sort replaced by
numerous gangs of country-bred urchins, who make
a trade of following the suburban omnibuses, and
tumbling heels over head, or wheeling' for a hundred
yards together on outstretched hands and feet, after the
manner of the gipsy broods, who, in times gone by,
swarmed in the track of the old stage-coaches, cutting
capers for the halfpence of the outsiders-an occupation
that will most assuredly cease to be remunerative when
London is again reduced to its average population.
Bob Rudge is the son of a 'navvie' employed on the
Great Northern Railway. His father's fifteen shillings
a week has been made to undergo a very considerable
stretching in order to make it sufficient for the wants
of eight young children, of whom Bob is the eldest, and
he not yet sixteen. The mother has too much to do
with her little troop of half-naked rebels to make any
further attempt at industry than is manifested to the
passers-by in the appearance of a small gingerbread
and apple stall in front of the blackened brick cottage
in Maiden Lane. If the poor woman manages by her
desultory traffic to pay the rent of the little domicile
she thinks herself well off. The number of undeniably
good appetites beneath Mr Rudge's small roof has been
long a source of perplexity to the honest man, and all
of them would certainly have been reduced to occa-
sional very short commons if Bob had not, like a dutiful
Maiden Lane and its adjoin-
son, come to the rescue.
ing purlieus and precincts, it should be known, are the
El Dorado, the unbought paradise, of hungry donkeys.
There and thereabouts are numberless small patches of
unenclosed grass, half-lumbered with bricks and building
materials, and destined to be built upon at no very
distant date. These are plentifully pastured by asses
too poorly ownered to boast of private lodgings, who
browse patiently among the broken bricks and rubbish,
and pick up a gratuitous livelihood, being turned out
of the shafts and left to shift for themselves whenever
relieved from duty. Man is ever the child of circum-
stances, and generally derives his knowledge, if indeed
he gets any worth having, from his personal surround-
ings. Little Bob Rudge, like the rest of us, caught up
his experience from the lessons of his daily life. He
was nurtured and dwelt among donkeys, and from
the long habit of observing their predilections and
propensities, has at last struck out a business for
himself, enabling him to relieve his parents of the
burden of his maintenance, and further, to render
valuable co-operation towards that of the family.
All round the suburbs of London, girding the
metropolis in every direction, are miles upon miles of
open sewers and drains. The pedestrian who diverges
from the beaten track is often only prevented from
walking into them by the kindly information of his
olfactory nerves: they are carried by numerous culverts

under the New River in the north, and under the roads
and railways in the east and south; the aristocratic
nostrils of the west have voted them a nuisance, and
there they abound in less profusion; but everywhere
their odours ascend and flavour the country air which the
retired citizen imagines he is inhaling in all its purity.
But the poison of one man is the meat of another, and
this interminable source of disease and death little Bob
Rudge has made the foundation of his traffic. The
banks of these endless ditches and drains are every-
where covered with a rank and luxurious vegetation,
chiefly consisting of a gigantic species of succulent
grass rising on long reedy stems, which is to a donkey
what turtle-soup is to an alderman. This Master Bob
collects and sells by the sackful to the owners of asses;
not to the poverty-stricken proprietors of the squatting
herds in his own immediate neighbourhood, but to the
thriving owners of the lively brutes who, on Hampstead
Heath, and other such places of fashionable resort,
amble flauntingly in milk-white drapery beneath the
soft side-saddles of the frolic fair, or plod quietly along,
guided by the feeble hand of the consumptive invalid.
Bob's profession is anything but a sinecure.
began by being his own beast of burden. I met him
two years ago, armed with a short sickle and a sack six
feet long; he was levelling the herbage on the bank of
a ditch, and ramming it into his bag. Not being at all
in the secret, I questioned him as to the use of his crop.
'What is it for?' said he: 'why for the mokes to
be sure. Don't they like it-jest!'
He
'You don't pretend that they prefer it to grass or
hay?'
'Don't they though? They prefers it to anythink.
If you got a moke, you jest try him: if you lives handy
here, I'll be proud to sarve yer. Bless your 'art, about
three bags on it turns 'em out as sleek as a mole. Vy,
look 'ere; it's pretty nigh all juice-aint it?' With that
"The mokes is no fools,
he squeezed a handful of the reedy grass till his fingers
were dripping with moisture.
whatever you think on 'em: they likes gravy in their
meat as well as Christians. He, he! You don't catch
'em leavin' on it till 'tis all gone, I can tell yer. I could
sell ten times as much as I do if I could git it, only 'tis
so fur to take it. This 'ere's a-goin' to Camden Town,
more nor two mile. If I had a moke o' my own I'd do
well.'
By this time he had reaped a dozen yards of the
bank, and cut enough to fill his bag. He rammed it in
with his head and shoulders as the sack lay upon the
ground, until it was tight enough to stand upright.
Raising it on end till it towered far above his head, he
stooped, and buckling it round his waist by straps
stitched to the sacking, walked off with bended back,
the ponderous load projecting forwards over his head,
like the coffin of Daniel Lambert on the back of a
Lilliputian undertaker.
Bob has now grown quite the little man of business.
His ambition is gratified, for he has two 'mokes' of his
own, and is doing a smart trade as commissariat to a
pretty numerous regiment of donkeys, if one may judge
by the palpable improvement in his costume and the
expression of his confident face. He reaps and sells his
crops without paying rent, taxes, or tithe. The paternal
cottage has been lately painted and whitewashed; little
Dick has made his first appearance in a shirt; and a
neat-boarded shed, well pitched with tar and weather-
proof, in the rear of the dwelling, gives token at once of
Bob's prosperity and his humane care for the comforts
of his friends and benefactors the mokes, who have
helped in bringing it about. How he employs his time
and his donkey-power in winter is a secret which, not
being in his confidence, I have not been able to fathom.
I have no doubt that he has found a market for both,
and turns them to good account. I encountered him
only a few days ago in a field not far from the Seven
Sisters' Road. He was accompanied by young Dick;

both were busy 'reaping where they had not sown;'
and their allies the mokes, tethered to a hurdle in an
adjoining lane, stood witnessing the operation through
a gap in the hedge with characteristic satisfaction.

LADY E. S. WORTLEY'S TRAVELS.
THE Travels in the United States by Lady Emmeline
Stuart Wortley' is one of the cleverest books of the
present publishing season. Her ladyship is a shrewd
observer, liberal in tone, and humorous and graphic in
powers of description. Her work is consequently a
very different thing from other productions of the kind,
and it will be read with interest even by those who,
like ourselves, have perused almost everything that
has been written on America. We should also be
inclined to say that Lady Emmeline is possessed of no
small degree of courage, moral and physical. She tells
her mind pretty frankly, and goes everywhere, even
into very rude scenes, with only female attendants.
In one thing she is original: she is the first English
aristocratic writer who has spoken with respect and
admiration of the American character, and dared to
prognosticate for the nation a great future. We may
expect that Lady Emmeline will be deified by our trans-
atlantic friends, and held up as a fine set-off to the whole
race of Trollopes.
"
The round which this intrepid female traveller made
included some of the western states, Mexico, the island
of Cuba, and the Isthmus of Panama, across which she
went in order to have a glance at the Pacific, an ocean
now coming rapidly into importance-and not merely
talked about, but steamed upon. With singular
good sense, passing over the petty disagreeables that
must inevitably occur in this extensive and varied tour,
she speaks in glowing terms of the grandeur of many
things that came under her observation. With the
mightiness of the Mississippi she was duly impressed.
To this great sea-like river, she says Campbell's fine line
would apply as well as to the ocean: The lightning's
wing sinks halfway o'er thee like a wearied bird,'
After contemplating its gigantic features, she feels that
at home all will appear insignificant. I shall want a
microscope when I return to England, so miserably
small and petty will seem its rivers, its hills-all its
features. Magnifying-glasses might save one's patriotic
vanity a little till we get used to the miniature scale.
The Mississippi springs to life amid the chilly glare of
everlasting snows, and it ends its mighty career beneath
a burning sky-ay, almost under the flaming heavens
of the tropics. Nothing gives one a better idea of the
immensity and greatness of this sublime river, than
the reflection that a vast space, comprising about two
millions of square miles, pours its surplus waters into
this king of rivers. It is indeed a long sea. Then not
easily can one forget, on looking on those wonderful
waters, what change another hundred years will almost
certainly have produced on the vast scenes which they
lave. What very nations of men will crowd on its
busy shores and throng its immense valley! What a
world of wonders will be presented to the future
voyager! What industry, what prosperity, what splen-
dour, what yet undreamed-of attainments of civilisation,
and triumphs of science, and achievements of art!
Already you see the beginnings of all these. The
desert is gradually blooming, the forest is retreating,
the habitations of men are rising in all directions; fleets
of steamers and other craft are covering the face of the
river; thousands of enterprising settlers are setting
foot on the shores, and advancing further and further
into the beleaguered wilderness: but a hundred years
hence, nay, fifty! Imagination almost fails to paint to
herself what shall then be unfolded and displayed in
broad day to the gladdened vision.'
* Bentley, London. 3 vols. 1851.
Reverting to this subject, after describing New
Orleans, Lady Emmeline ponders on the destiny of the
great people who are to work out the future of the
Mississippi Valley; and this leads her to sympathise
with the usually boastful character of the Americans,
inferring that with such mighty works of nature before
them they cannot help speaking in what seems to us
the language of exaggeration. 'It is all petty malice,
and jealousy which make people talk of their exag-
gerated expressions and ideas. A man must have
imagination indeed-must out-Shakspeare Shakspeare,
the myriad -minded, and the very lord of imagination,
to deal in hyperbolical extravagance here. What would
be exaggeration in other countries is here the simplest
moderation, and in all probability lags behind the
reality. The fact is, they feel their destiny and their
country's destiny, and they would be stocks and stones
if they did not; and if in England we are disposed to
think they "greatly daring" talk, we should remember
a little what a prospect lies before them. Nature, their
present, their future-all is in such an exaggerated
mood here, all on such a stupendous scale! For them
to have little views and entertain trifling projects, or
hold petty opinions with regard to their mighty country's
advancement and progress, would be as absurd as to
see a party of giants in go-carts or in pinafores, and
playing at "Tom Thumb" and "Goody Two-Shoes."
But the vulgar bragging of the Americans—for vulgar
and offensive it is, in spite of Lady Emmeline's indul-
gent remarks-may be expected, to undergo considerable
modifications. 'As the people progress and advance
more and more,' she says, they will gain more the
humility of true greatness."
Our authoress was not less gratified with the rapid
advances making by Boston than the bustle and tokens
of wealth in New York. The wharfs of this finely
situated city during the business season are densely
lined with the shipping of every maritime country
under the sun. Merchantmen of every size are there;
and for at least three miles they present an unin-
terruptedly - continued forest of masts and cordage,
commingling apparently with the chimneys of almost
innumerable steamers. More than 1000 sailing-vessels,
nearly 100 steamers, about 80 tow-boats, and 200 canal-
boats, may usually be found in the noble harbour of
New York during the busy time of year. In the severest
winter this harbour is never obstructed by ice, so that
vessels are not inconvenienced on that account. I
have already mentioned the magnificence of the New
York hotels, but must just add that the enormous
Astor House not only is said to be furnished with its
own private printing-press for striking off the diurnal
bills of fare, but it also makes all its own gas. How-
ever, it does not yet, I believe, manufacture its own
linen or plate!'
The more novel portion of the work refers to Mexico,
whose thoughtless inhabitants, clearly incapable of
self-government, she hits off in an amusing style. It
is Lady Emmeline's candid opinion that if the Mexicans
were to be free of revolutions and their troublesome
consequences, they would be positively too happy
They may be said to have paid, in the shape of 300
revolutions, for their superlatively fine climate, It is.
clear that people cannot be allowed to live in such
a paradise for nothing. We may go on and enjoy our
jog-trot peace and quiet at home in our misty little
island; we have to keep our windows shut, to exclude
the fog and chilling dropping rain: it would be hard to
have them broken open by drizzling cannon balls, and
rather expensive too, though glass is cheap. We want
a good roof over our heads, to prevent rude Boreas from
visiting us; to have it summarily blown off by a shell
would be a double hardship in our bitter clime. So
we have the blessings of order, as maintained by our
metropolitan and rural police; and of Britannia warm-
ing-pans and coal-scuttles; and the non-blessings of

During these revolutions funny things occasionally
occur. Our authoress was told a tale of a lady at
Puebla, who had some beautiful flowers on her balcony,
and who neglected them during the civil war, a week
ago (we came through as it was dying off, I believe,
but we were rather sleepy, and did not find it out at
all.) She left them for nearly three days, and then,
afraid that they would be quite spoiled, in spite of the
peppering balls that fell round faster than usual (the
popular tempest, just going to clear off perhaps for a
few weeks or so, was expending its last strength fit-
fully), out she stepped on her fair balcony armed with
a watering-pot-not so bad a weapon after all if it
could have held enough-and proceeded to refresh the
unlucky flowers, some of which had had their heads
carried off by bullets, while several were bearing scars
like the very flowers of chivalry. She watered them
pretty fast, you may be sure; but before she had done,
bang came a great ball, and cut in two the body of a
flower-pot. That was enough; away ran the lady at
once, thinking that the flowers had better be killed than
herself is die g

The streets of Mexico are broad, clean, and airy, and
the gayest in the world. The equipages are splendid,
and the costumes of the people brilliant and striking.
Then, what abundance of novelties in the shops,
arranged beneath open arcades! What is there not
to be found here? Look round: here are sombreros,
mantillas, reboses, satins, silks, silver, gold, china, pic-
tures, mats, and twenty thousand things besides, all
close at hand; and just look at those splendidly-
embroidered cloth-mangos for gentlemen, with a circular
piece of coloured velvet in the middle to act as a sort
of masculine necklace. Here are wax figures, most
elaborately and exquisitely finished, faithful represen-
tations of every class in Mexico a perfect population
in themselves, and, it is asserted, not given to the
melting mood, which you would have suspected. Here
are spurs like merely moderately - sized windmills!
that weigh, some of them, a pound and a half, and the
rowels of which clatter along the pavement, when the
wearer happens to walk, like a travelling tinker's store
on an uproarious and kicking donkey. And here are
gold and silver ornaments in lace, and aërial flounces
and furbelows, and artificial flowers, which it is said
but I cannot corroborate the assertion by having wit-
nessed anything of the sort are made by men; and
that you may there see a whole regiment of stout,
active Mexicans, who ought to be quarrying stone, or
working in the mines, or mending their abominable
roads (which must destroy a large proportion of ill-
starred travellers annually, we should think), with
enormous moustaches, and desperate-looking cuchillos
at hand, actually employed in mincingly manipulating
delicate decorations for ladies' dresses, trimming fairy-
caps, and artistically twisting and pinning bows of
ribbon. Would the reader like to give 200 dollars for
a cheap pair of Guadalaxara stamped leathern boots,
wrought all over with silver? And a saddle for about
double that trifling sum? Would he admire more
those lassos or sarapes, or beautiful Mexican hats, with
their tassels and broad rolls of shining silver, fastened
with little lions, serpents, and other devices? Or has
he any fancy to pay away a small fortune for a com-
plete set of horse-furniture, and a full riding-dress of
the country to match? It is a most beautiful costume

altogether; and one cannot help hoping that the Mexi-
can caballeros will not give up their magnificent and
appropriate costume, and splendid horse-equipments, to
adopt the ugly fashions of Europe."

With Havana, the capital of Cuba, Lady Emmeline
was enchanted. The beauty of the cloudless climate,
the richness of the vegetation, and the fairy-like grace-
fulness of the female inhabitants, reclining in their
glittering volantes, were all attractive. Going to the
paséo, as the place of fashionable resort is called, the
scene is thus described. Here a multitude of carriages
swarmed in double lines, and all seemed like a fairy
tale in action. Those graceful, aërial-looking, gaily-
painted open volantes, like cars fit for Queen Mab, and
the ethereal-seeming beings within, crowned with
flowers, with no other covering on their gracious heads
than these delicate blossoms, and their own massive
braids of superb black hair for very seldom did they
even wear the mantilla, and when they did, its exqui-
sitely-disposed folds seemed little else than the light

their fans, with which they fluttered light pretty salu-
tations to each other!those glistening feathery fans,
like the wings of sylphides: and their dresses! surely
Arachne herself must have spun them, and Iris coloured
them! I will try and paint, in words, three of these
fair daughters of Cuba, as they recline in their luxurious
volantes. One is in a dress of the most sky-like azure;
another in a diaphanous dreamy sort of robe, of the
most gossamer texture, and of the softest yet brightest
tint of rose-colour; and the third-who sits forward in
the middle is in spotless lily white: and these dresses
float light and full as very clouds about them. They
are all décoltée, and with very short sleeves, and all are
snow-pale with statuesque features and magnificent
hair. There seem to be hundreds and thousands of
these carriages, with equally fair and fairy-like dumosels
within, and clad in every hue of the rainbow-lilac,
emerald-green, the faintest strawy-yellow-that admir-
ably suits with their generally jet-black locks-and
various delicate tints and shades of all colours. The
carriages themselves look like enormous butterflies
glittering in the rays of the descending sun, with their
innumerable, bright, varied colours. Then how beauti-
ful are the long double rows of trees on either side of
the paséo, and the flowers, and the exquisite sky above,
and the splendid fountains, falling into sculptured
marble basins; and how charming is the delicious
temperature and the soft breeze from the neighbouring
sea!"
Pity that the race of holiday-makers who occupy
this paradise of an island are so utterly incompetent in
the way of general progress. That they are destined
to lose it, sooner or later, there can be no reasonable
doubt. Of the transit across the Isthmus of Panama,
likewise afflicted with a slothful race of Spanish Creoles,
the authoress gives some interesting particulars; but
for these and other matters we must refer the reader
to the book itself, which will amply repay perusal.
DOMENICHINO.
DOMENICHO ZAMPIERI was born at Bologna in the
month of October 1581. He was the second son of a
shoemaker, who, by the persevering exercise of his
humble trade, gained a comfortable living. The elder
Zampieri wisely determined to give his sons a good
education, with a view to their embracing liberal pro-

was the painter Calvart. This artist offered the shoe-
maker to take his eldest son and instruct him in the
art of painting, and the proposal was gladly accepted.
It now remained to dispose of the younger son, a
quiet, reserved, sad-looking boy, who took no pleasure

in the noisy games of his young neighbours, but always
sought to muse in some retired corner.
What shall I make of him?' said his perplexed
father one day to Calvart: he is a strange, moping sort
of boy, whose inclination it is difficult to discover.'
'Make him a priest,' replied the painter: 'you can't
do better than put him into the church. Gregory VII.
was a carpenter: the worshipful guild of shoemakers
has not yet supplied us with a pope, but who can say
what it may do?'
Calvart's advice was followed, and Domenicho Zam-
pieri commenced the studies preparatory to a course of
theology. Being naturally of a studious, meditative
disposition, he had acquired at the end of four years a
considerable amount of information and learning calcu-
lated both to enlarge the mind and benefit the heart.
Meantime Calvart was labouring in vain, trying to
make an artist of the elder brother. Not a single spark
of genius could he elicit; and at length he told the
shoemaker that the lad, whatever might be his vocation,
would never make a painter.
'Well,' said Calvart, 'I got you into this scrape, and
I will now try to get you out of it. Let your boys
change places: the eldest, I daresay, will make an
excellent priest; and as to the youngest, without any
instruction, and from merely visiting my studio occa-
sionally, he has already acquired a far greater knowledge
of painting than his brother.'
Once more was Calvart's counsel followed implicitly,
and Domenicho found himself at liberty to follow the
career for which nature had intended him. He soon
became Calvart's best pupil, and his master predicted
that his fame would equal his own.
This Calvart was a Flemish painter of undoubted
merit, and who in public estimation occupied a place
next to the Caracci. But this did not satisfy him: he
wanted to excel the distinguished brothers of Bologna;
and so far did his jealousy extend, that he forbade his
pupils, on pain of expulsion, to enter the studio of his
rivals, or even to copy any of their works.
Notwithstanding this prohibition, our hero became
acquainted with a youth of his own age named Albano,
who, as well as Guido, had commenced his studies
under Calvart, but a short time before had deserted to
the enemy's camp-that is to say, the studio of Ludo-
vico Caracci. The sympathy of taste and feeling which
at first attracted the young men towards each other
soon ripened into close friendship, and Zampieri was ere-
long induced to visit the forbidden scene of Albano's
studies. There he could not help perceiving Caracci's
vast superiority to his own master; but filled with
gratitude towards Calvart, and nobly unwilling to
desert his cause, he warmly defended the Flemish
painter against the sneering accusations of want of
skill which Albano's companions were wont to bring
against him. However, he thought it quite allowable,
for his own private improvement, to make copies at
home of some of Caracci's masterpieces. For some
time he did this in secret; but at length some tale-
bearer carried the story to Calvart, who, under pretext
of paying a visit to Domenicho's father, went imme-
diately to ascertain its truth.
He began by praising the youth's progress, and then
asked the father to shew him the pieces which he
painted at home. The delighted shoemaker hastened
to usher his visitor into the attic which Domenicho
occupied; and there one glance was sufficient for the
jealous painter. On the easels against the walls every-
where did he see copies from the works of the Caracci,
and none from his own! He, however, dissembled his
wrath, and on his return said nothing of his visit to the
culprit, who heard of it in the evening from his father.
Great was Domenicho's consternation. With fear
and trembling he repaired next morning to the studio,
thinking that Calvart would expel him. The artist
was walking up and down the room with hasty strides,
stopping now and then to inspect the works of some of
his dullest pupils, and praise them in an extravagant,
and yet irritated manner. At length he stood behind
Domenicho, who was employed in putting the finishing
touches to an admirable study from nature, one which
offended the Flemish painter's eye from its unmistak-
able likeness to the school of Caracci.
'Domenicho,' said he, pressing his hand heavily on the
young man's shoulder, you have been going on very
badly of late, falling off in your painting, and spend-
ing your time with that good-for-nothing scapegrace,
Albano.'
'But, master'-
began Domenicho.
'And worse than that,' interrupted Calvart,' you try
to imitate these unworthy Caracci, whose mission
seems to be to destroy every rule and principle of good
painting. Do you think that in this way you will ever
become an artist ?'
Domenicho, without deigning to reply, shrugged his
shoulders.
This unlucky gesture was taken by Calvart as an
impertinent answer to himself, and acted like a spark
falling on a train of gunpowder. His rage knew no
bounds; he tore the canvas from Domenicho's easel,
dragged the young man towards the door, and dismissed
him with a violent box on the ear.
The next day our hero, to the great delight of his
friend Albano, enrolled himself among the pupils of
Ludovico Caracci. In the evening a supper was given
in his honour by his new companions, and it was with
great difficulty he could prevent them from going after-
wards in a body to serenade, in anything but a com-
plimentary manner, the ears of Master Calvart.
In order to excite the emulation of his pupils,
Ludovico Caracci was in the habit, from time to time,
of giving a prize to whichever among them produced
the best painting; and one of these trials of skill took
place soon after Zampieri's entrance. The new-comer,
diffident of his powers, dared not enter the lists, but
finished a sketch in secret. When the prize was
adjudged, his master upbraided him with his timidity,
and Domenicho ventured to shew his sketch, almost
anticipating blame. Ludovico Caracci, however, was
so much struck with its merits that he appealed to his
assembled pupils to pronounce what its author deserved.
With one accord they assigned to him the first place, and
the youth who had gained the prize yielded it to him
with the best possible grace. It was at this time that
he began to be called Domenichino, by which caressing
diminutive of his Christian name he continued to be
known, almost to the exclusion of his patronymic.
Our hero was endowed by nature with a tender, loving
heart, and his affection for Albano increased daily. It
was, therefore, a sad trial to him when his volatile
friend set out for Roine. During a year Domenichino
patiently pursued his studies at Bologna, and then
yielding to Albano's pressing entreaties, he went to
Rome. There he was kindly received by Annibal
Caracci, who was then painting the Farnese Gallery.
Associated in his master's labours, he produced a
picture, The Death of Adonis,' which was at first
attributed by the public to Caracci; but the latter was
too upright to profit by the error, and took care to
secure to his pupil his full meed of praise.
Domenichino could not boast rapidity of conception,
nor any remarkable facility of execution. He loved to
remain secluded in his studio, working out patiently
his own ideas, and avoiding the gay society of his fel-
lows. Therefore among them he was far from being
popular: they laughed at the shoemaker's son, who
dressed shabbily, and cared so little to join in their
sports. In contempt of his apparent slowness they
gave him the nickname of The Or.
6
He whom you call an ox,' said Annibal Caracci
one day, will plough his furrow after a fashion that
will yet fertilise the field of art.'

Thomas Aquinas, on account of his presumed dulness,
received when a boy a similar title from his comrades.
They were reproved by his illustrious master, Albert
the Great, in the following words :-'If Thomas is an
ox, he is one whose roaring will yet fill the world.'
The noble House of Aguechi, of Florentine origin,
was at this time represented at Rome by two of its
members the one, P. Aguechi, was a cardinal, the
other, J. B. Aguechi, was a man of immense wealth,
and a passionate lover of the fine arts. Through the
interest of Albano, Domenichino obtained an introduc-
tion to this powerful patron, and painted for him two
excellent pictures. These caused quite a sensation in
Rome, and very soon a band of jealous rivals sought
how they might injure the unsuspecting artist. One
day Cardinal Aguechi told his younger brother that
he must immediately expel from his palace a dange-
rous infidel and scurrilous painter, as he believed
Domenichino to be.
J. B. Aguechi, not wishing to displease his powerful
and imperious brother, appeared to acquiesce, but pri-
vately reassured his protégé as to the issue of the
business. He gave a splendid banquet in honour of
the cardinal's birthday, and in the evening proposed
that the assembled guests should view his picture-
gallery, to which, he said, he had lately made several
additions. Now this gallery, although much talked of,
was but little seen; for Aguechi, like many great col-
lectors, was chary of exhibiting his treasures to public
gaze, and reserved the view of them for those choice
spirits who could really appreciate their merits.
Therefore, on the present occasion, the company
eagerly expressed their satisfaction at the promised.
treat.
6
'It would seem, brother,' said the cardinal, that
your gallery must contain marvels.'
"Your Eminence shall judge for yourself.'
Accordingly the cardinal, followed by the other
guests, passed through the door which their host held
open, and truly beheld inestimable treasures. There
was a panel whose surface was painted on wax by the
Greek Apollonius in the thirteenth century; pieces by
Cimabue, Giotto, Perugino, Leonardo Da Vinci, and
Raphael, besides several great artists of the time. At
one end of the gallery the cardinal remarked a green
curtain, which seemed to veil some large painting, and
he asked his brother to withdraw it. J. B. Aguechi
feigned excessive reluctance; but the cardinal per-
sisted so earnestly in his request that at length the
curtain was drawn back, and Domenichino's magnifi-
cent painting of 'St Peter in Prison' appeared, brilliantly
lighted up by a ray of the setting sun. The cardinal,
who, without being as accomplished as his brother,
really possessed taste, was struck, not to say startled,
by the beauty of the picture. He looked at it for some
time in silence through his hand half-closed in the form
of a tube.
Why, this is a chef-d'œuvre!' he exclaimed at last.
'What do you think of it, gentlemen?'
The obsequious guests, who had waited to take their
cue from the cardinal, now with one accord launched
out into extravagant praises of the painting.
'Who is the artist ?' asked his Eminence.
'My brother,' replied J. B. Aguechi, 'you will
please to recollect that it was only in compliance with
your own urgent entreaties that I shewed you this
piece: it is the production of a Bolognese painter
who has had the misfortune to incur your Eminence's
displeasure.'
He had just completed the latter piece when the
cardinal died. Before his death he recommended
Domenichino to the protection of Cardinal Aldobran-
dini, who complied with his friend's wishes by intrusting
his protégé with the decoration of the palace of the
Belvedere. He also painted a series of pictures of
sacred subjects for the abbey of Grotta-Ferrata; and
these, still bright and glowing as the day when they
started into life, attract even now the notice and
admiration of visitors.
After some time he returned to Rome, where Albano
was occupied in executing pictures to adorn the castle
of Bassano, belonging to the Marchese di Giustiniani.
Here Domenichino experienced the value of true
friendship. The generous Albano, under pretext of
wanting time, persuaded the marchese to confide part
of the work to his friend. Accordingly, while he was
engaged on the 'History of Apollo,' Domenichino was
employed in painting the 'History of Diana.'
For his splendid piece, The Communion of St
Jerome,' executed at this period, and destined for the
chapel of San-Girolamo-della-Carità, he received the
miserable sum of fifty crowns. But from it he reaped
an abundant harvest of fame. It burst on the public
as a resurrection from the ancient school of art, and
its author was lauded to the skies. He had, however,
a bitter enemy, named Lanfranc, who accused him of
being a mere servile copyist of the Caracci. Agostino
Caracci had, in fact, treated the same subject, and the
two compositions bore some faint resemblance to each
other. Through the intrigues of Lanfranc 'The Com-
munion of St Jerome' was thrown into a barn, where
Poussin, twenty years afterwards, discovered it. The
French painter proclaimed its transcendant merits, and
through his influence it was placed in the Vatican,
opposite Raphael's 'Transfiguration.' The remainder
of Domenichino's career was strangely chequered by
weal and wo. He married a beautiful girl, named
Marsibilia, to whom he was fondly attached, and whose
devoted affection was his chief support under those
trials which his sensitive spirit could so badly bear.
Lanfranc and the Spanish painter Josef Ribera, sur-
named Spagnoletto, persecuted him without ceasing.
At length the latter devised the cruel expedient of
bribing a workman to spoil the frescoes which Dome-
nichino was painting for the dome of San Gennajo.
Despite this injury, however, and the sorrow which
he felt at the death of his two children, our artist con-
tinued to prosecute his work until the fear of poison
broke down his spirit. He refused to leave his house,
and took no food save that which he had prepared with
his own hands. Notwithstanding these precautions he
died in 1641, a victim to poison by some accounts, but,
as others assert, cut off by pulmonary consumption.
PEAT AS A MANURE.
[The following is from a little practical brochure by Mr James
Cuthill of Camberwell, entitled 'Market-Gardening Round Lon-
don,'* in which a horticultural account is given of everything-
from cauliflowers to parsley, from filberts to water-cresses-grown
in the neighbourhood of the metropolis for its own supply.]
I HAVE tried the following plants in a mixture of peat-
charcoal and earth with the following results :-
Geraniums.-These luxuriate in a mixture of three
material they make good saleable plants in half the usual
ounces of pure charcoal to one pound of mould. In this
time. Cuttings strike freely, either in the pure charcoal
or in the mixture.
Cucumbers. For these I mixed the charred peat with
What! Domenichino? Who could have told me mould during winter, and when the plants are put into
that he was a mere heretical dauber?'
'His ignorant and jealous rivals say so.'
( Well, well, it is not too late to make him amends.'
From that time our artist enjoyed the favour of
Cardinal Aguechi. He painted for him 'St Jerome in
his Grotto,' and 'St Francis kneeling before a Crucifix.'
it, they grew famously, and produced a heavy crop. The
peat-charcoal not only yields nutriment, but it affords
good drainage. Cucumber tops strike root freely in pure
charred peat.

Melons.-These succeeded in a mixture of charred peat
and soil equally well with the cucumbers; and if a large
proportion of the soil consist of peat, I am of opinion that
the flavour of the fruit will be improved, more especially
in cloudy, sunless seasons.
Strawberries grow admirably in charred peat mixed
with soil, and in the case of pot plants they like a good
handful of the pure peat placed in the bottoms of the
pots. This latter has a tendency to prevent the ingress
of worms, which do not appear to like its sharp edges.
Vines. I have not yet tried the effect of charred peat
on vines; but judging from analogous cases, I am certain
that it will prove of much advantage to them, not only
as a fertiliser, but also as a means of keeping the borders
porous, and thereby bringing better into action the other
materials of which they may be composed. Under such
an arrangement much finer - flavoured fruit may be
expected.
Potatoes.-I have found those manured with charred
peat drier and more mealy than others to which farm-
yard manure was applied. In the former, the foliage and
stalks are more compact and firm, and when taken up
the tubers were found to be clean-skinned. In my case
no wireworm came near them. Where potatoes are pitted
in long ridges, in the open ground, a layer of peat between
them and the soil helps to keep them dry, and if this
heap could be covered with it below the straw it would
also be an advantage.
In flower-gardens, peat-charcoal will be found invalu-
able, inducing, as it does, quick growth; but not over-
luxuriant, and consequently plenty of blossoms. Under
its influence the colours of the latter are well brought
out.'
The experiments mentioned above were all tried last
year. This season I have found that if, instead of horse-
dung being turned and sweetened for a month before it
is used for forcing, it is allowed about a week's laying,
and then put into a four-light pit, and covered over with
an inch of peat-charcoal, all will be well. Under this
system, by the time my cucumber plants came up, all
sinell was removed. Again, gardeners are much annoyed
in January and February by plants damping off. I dusted
my cucumber plants in the pans every morning with peat,
and I did not lose six out of 600. Those treated in this
way throve better than the others, and produced a more
healthy, dark-green leaf. In short, I consider charred
peat in a melon ground to be as necessary as a telegraph
to a railroad. The one is incomplete without the other.
The sort of charred peat that I use is the granulated kind.
If
I have only to add, that I never had finer crops of
strawberries in pots, as well as all the above sorts of
plants, than I have had this summer. On frequent
examination of the roots, I have always found the young
fibres adhering closely round the particles of peat, shewing
at once the great benefit they derive from it, not only in
the shape of nourishment, but also in the warmth, air,
and moisture the charcoal affords, being so porous.
this is the case in a light soil, to clayey land a good
dressing must be much more beneficial. My potatoes
have never been better than this year (1851.) I have
had many potatoes weighing three-quarters of a pound,
the stems strong and woody, with not half so much water
in their system as usual. And if my plan of wintering
them was carried out (as mentioned in the Belgian Prize-
Essay on the Potato,' in my last pamphlet), the potato
would bid defiance to disease; as we find the charred
peat to be so splendid a manure, and without an end,
covering, as it does, three millions of acres, from fifteen to
thirty-five feet deep, and lying just at our hand, and in a
distressed part of the three kingdoms, where industry only
wants stirring up; for in England the Irish are the most
industrious, hard-working people on the face of the earth.
By using this manure largely, you will not only be enrich-
ing your own ground, but be lending a helping hand to
poor Ireland, where Providence had placed the peat as
a blessing; but the uses of the material were not to be
discovered until wanted. It is now in a ripe state. The
earth wants more manure, and a greater demand is made
upon it, which will increase as the population multiplies.
And when this mighty store, laid up for the earth's use
in time of need, is all gone, some other vast hidden
accumulation will appear. In the meantime, the Irish
Amelioration Society, Waterloo Place, London, deserves
encouragement for the help their operations in Ireland
have given to the people in their late great struggle for
existence, not less than for the benefit you will confer on
yourself by purchasing the article they sell, which I have
been endeavouring to shew is a first-rate manure, and a
capital deodoriser of all obnoxious smells.
A FANCY ABOUT A BOY.
'Nothing less than nothing-and vanity!'
WE stood beside the window-sill,
The little lad and I;
Within the room was sober gloom,
Without, a sunset sky.
I drew him forward to the light,
That I might see him plain;
That sudden view thrilled my heart through
With a delicious pain.
I leant his head back o'er my arm,
And stroked his crispèd hair-
The dear, dear curls, o'er which salt pearls
I could have rained out there!
I looked beneath his heavy lids,
Drooping with dreamy fold;
What visioned eyes I saw arise!
But nothing shall be told.
Gaily I spoke: Could I count back
Nine years, and he gain nine,
I would not say what ill to-day
Had chanced this heart of mine.'
He laughed all laughed-I most of all:
But I was glad, I ween,
That the whole room lay in such gloom-
His face alone was scen.
He talked to me in schoolboy phrase;
I gave him meet replies-
I mind not what; my sense was nought,
Or lived but in my eyes.
I could not kiss him as a child,
I only touched his hair,
Or with my hand his broad brow spanned;
But not that it was fair.
He strange to me as I to him,
We never met before;
Yet I would fain brave mickle pain
To see the lad once more.
But why this was, and is, God knows!
And I-I know, with joy,
I'll find among His angel throng
An angel-like that boy!

said he would assist me by reading a chapter for me in

the Bible, and went on with his exposition for an hour
and a half. When my turn came, of what use could I be

he kindly proffered me the same aid, adding, I can be

ENJOYMENT OF THE FUTURE.
Ir must be confessed that a very seductive study is
afforded by that science which treats of the successive
revolutions that rent asunder the crust of the primeval
globe, and of the series of races which inherited by
turns the pre-Adamite earth. It is interesting to trace
what appears to be the preparation our world received
by those mighty changes for some condition of per-
manence and tranquillity, and to follow the fearful and
wonderful developments of organic life till they ended
in Man. But what next? What is to follow? Has
the awful and magnificent drama really come to a con-
clusion? May the mind at length sink into rest and
contentment after having revelled in the marvels of
geology? This is impossible. These marvels have
only given the impetus to excitement; and we turn
our eyes from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven,'
in search of the new phenomena that are to follow.
Is it reasonable to suppose that man is only a link
in the chain, a race in the series of existences; and
that after him will come some different and nobler
being to continue the infinite progress? Is it reason-
able to suppose that even now we are in the course of
a new geological revolution, which, slower still than the
movement of a glacier, will take ages upon ages for its
development? To think thus we believe to be as con-
trary to reason as it is to Scripture; but we believe,
likewise, that although at the birth of man there termi-
nated one series both of organic and inorganic changes,
he is the beginner of another of a wholly different cha-
racter. The stone monsters of the old world which
geology has caused the earth to disgorge from her
successive strata, and to relate their history to us with
the distinctness of written monuments, exercised no
influence upon the destinies of the world otherwise than
as forming a portion of its crust. They flew, they
swam, they crawled, they ravened, they died-and that
was all. A convulsion of the globe buried one race,
and a new one took its place, as unconscious of the fate
of its predecessor as it was unable to prophesy its own.
But man is in quite a different position both as
regards the physical world and the fortunes of his own
race. The aspect of the former he is able to change at
his will. Wherever he goes he makes, when he does
not find, the conditions necessary for his existence.
He modifies the climate, disarms the thunder, sweeps
away the forest, drains the marsh, bores his path through
the rock, throws a road over or under the river, descends
into the bowels of the earth, and skims over the surface
of the deep. But, unsatisfied with this sovereignty over
material things, he flings his influence abroad into
the future; making laws for unborn generations, and
moulding the form and destiny of times that as yet
have no existence. This is the grand distinctive cha-
racter of his being. He lives in the future. Even
without the aid of revelation he conceives the idea of
a future life, and feels, without being able to see, that
he is not a thing of dust, but a spirit of the universe.
From his earliest childhood, his thoughts, his dreams,
his longings, flee away into the future. He is not a child
when he plays with his companions, but the future
man, father, master; and as he advances into life, that
mystical future recedes before him, and so he marches
on, and on, and on. He works, plans, provides, all
for the future. He plants woods, and builds dwellings,
cities, temples, all for the future. He lays up treasure
for the future; and when arrived at the end of the
present-when the last sands of life are running, and the
grave yawns to receive him, and the darkness of death
descends upon him like a pall-behold! a new dayspring
rises amid the gloom, the silver cord is loosed, and he
steps into the future. Yes, with the appearance of
this being there ended the series of geological changes,
and in him there commences a series of moral changes
as awful and astonishing.
In examining this connection of man with the
future, we observe the difference between two important
springs of human action-the love of reputation, and
the love of fame-and are able to estimate their respec-
tive value. He whose god is reputation is obviously
an inferior being, debarred from the exercise of the
higher functions of his nature. He is only a child of
the future as belonging to the species, for he is
incapable of appreciating or enjoying his inheritance.
He is satisfied with the applause he can hear, and the
reward he can feel, and pleases himself with the maxim
of a spurious philosophy-Eat, drink, and be merry,
for to-morrow ye die.' Now, there is in this, to the
unreflecting mind, a certain colouring of common sense.
What benefit, it is asked, can we derive from a fame
which is born only when we have ceased to live?
What can the future do, as regards the enjoyments of
this state of existence, for a being who dies with the
present? What compensation can he find in posthu-
mous renown for the labours and woes of his mortal
life? Does the fame of the Macedonian hero, which still
resounds throughout the world, warm the ashes in his
grave of ages? or does this fame constitute the paradise
of our own blind schoolmaster, the teacher of all times?
The answer is: That the aspirations of man are a part of
his nature, and that the exercise of the nobler functions
of our constitution forms in itself the happiness of the
mind, just as the exercise of the instincts forms the
happiness of the senses. These aspirations are their
own reward: the future is enjoyed in the present; and

the free spirit wears the crown, even when the head
knows not where to rest. The idea that the love of
fame is absurd, since it is impossible to realise its
enjoyments, can only proceed from a grovelling mind,
unable to comprehend any higher felicity than its own.
But the longing after fame is confined to a few. It
requires for its dwelling a mind of a peculiar and some-
what poetical order; while the practical working out of
great ideas, without any reference to posthumous com-
pensation, is a far more common test of character in the
children of the future. But here we are met with the
same objection. Why care for generations that are yet
unborn? What pleasure can you philanthropists take
in benefiting those who have never done anything for
you, and whom you will never see? It is better to
enjoy the present, and leave the future to take care of
itself! Why, this enjoyment is precisely what they seek,
however unconsciously to themselves! In caring for
the future they enjoy the present in its keenest relish;
while the objectors, absorbed in the exercise of the
lower functions of human nature, proclaim that they
belong to an inferior and less-favoured order of the
species. All this feverish excitement we see around us
this longing and labouring after the improvement of
mankind-is a proof that in our day the new series of
progression goes rapidly on, and that we discharge our
prescribed task in the work of human life with zeal
and fidelity.
The instinctive striving even of common minds after a
good that is not to be enjoyed by their own generation
is one of the most remarkable phenomena of man's
nature. We argue, we toil, we lavish our fortune, we
submit to present hardships and privations-for what
purpose? In order that at some indefinite time an
advantage may arise to be enjoyed by beings yet
unborn. These hypothetical beings are nothing to us
or ours. If indeed we crippled our resources in order
to improve an estate which would yield the return to
our heirs, the thing would be intelligible on the prin-
ciple of a wide and generous selfishness. In like
manner, when the kindly Hindoo plants a grove, he
pleases himself with the notion not only that some
unborn traveller may repose in its shade, but while
reposing bless his unknown benefactor; and therefore,
while admiring the beautiful action, we are at liberty
to suspect that the advantage he thinks his soul will
derive from that grateful thought mingles with benevo-
lence in the motive. But there are a thousand objects
of human effort which are wholly inconsistent with the
idea of self-interest of any kind whatever; even of that
kind which arises from our habit of identifying our-
selves with the beings in posse who are to proceed from
our own blood. We may mention as an instance the
earnest struggles that are now making by all wise and
good men to wrest from bigotry and ignorance an edu-
cation for the people. These champions of civilisation
do not consist merely of the young, who may suppose
themselves to have some interest in the growth of
knowledge and order in the land: the old man
who totters on the brink of the grave is one of the
foremost of the band, and his step becomes firm and
strong, and his eye gleams with a generous light
which is to him an actual existence, and which his
spirit presses forward to meet. His labours are labours
of love, and his compensations spring from the exercise
of the required functions of his being. But this he
does not know any more than the unreasoning animal
knows why it loves, cherishes, and would die for its
young. They both fulfil their destiny-the animal and
the man: the one belonging to the present, the other
to the future; the one perishing, the other living for
ever. And this future, in its mundane sense, only
ends with the end of the world. It is vain to dream
that when this or that is accomplished our labours will
cease. Our labours will never cease, for they are a
condition of our existence. The future recedes step by
step as we advance, and we advance till we stumble
into the grave.
This reminds us of one of those great thoughts of
Christianity, which would be enough of themselves to
testify the divinity of its Founder, and which, when the
mind is once awakened to their grandeur, excite both
astonishment and awe. We allude to the impossible
perfection we are commanded to reach. If this perfec-
tion were attainable by human nature, it would not only
give rise to a thousand delusions and misconceptions,
but would, if really attained, be the destruction of the
soul, which would say in secret, with the pride of the
Jewish formalist: All these things have I kept!' But
the unattainableness of the prescribed perfection keeps
the loftiest natures on the stretch. Even like the
future, what they seek recedes as they advance; and
the pilgrim of the world finds at length that the object
of his struggles and reward of his labours lies beyond
the grave.
In describing the distinctive character of the race, we
have furnished a test wherewith to try the intellectual
standing of individuals; for he of course holds the first
rank who discharges best the loftier functions of his
nature. It is vain for the sneerer to pride himself on
what he calls the 'common-sense 'views that chain
him to the present; they prove simply that his intellect
is of a lower order, that in mental vision he is pur-
blind, that he is an inferior and imperfect being. Not,
however, that the heir of the future is inattentive to
the present; for in reality he is more attentive than if
the latter bounded his horizon. With him the present
is a portion of the future just as time is a portion of
eternity; and the same attribute of his nature which
throws him upon the distant and unborn, directs his
sympathies towards the beings that surround him.
But the practical corollary is obvious to any one who
observes and thinks. Let him only divide the indi-
viduals of his acquaintance into high and low intellects,
mean and lofty spirits, and he will find that he has
separated the slaves of the present from the children of
the future.
THE STRANGE SCHOONER.
MEIN HERR VON BISCHOFF was a Dutchman, as almost
every one will perceive from his name, and one of the
most comfortable, smoking, tea-drinking, punch-imbib-

him why, he will tell you of the good to come a score
or two of years after his body is dust and his soul
for ever severed from the things of time. Does he
expect the thanks of that new generation? Does he
look for the fame of a public benefactor? He smiles
at the idea. Of what service would thanks be to the
dead? Fame! he does not comprehend what fame
means: he is an obscure, quiet, comfortable man, who,
if public honours were offered him even in life, would
refuse to have them, if he could refuse for laughing!
The motive is innate. The old man as well as the
young belongs to the future, and the future belongs to
him. He yearns over the idea of the unborn world,
business at an early era, no one knew why, unless
from love of ease, though certainly it was quite clear
he had enough to live upon. He had been a mer-
chant in New York, but no longer lived in that city.
He had before he was forty years of age retired to a
splendid estate on both sides of a small creek that
opened into a lovely bay. A green and high bluff stood
on the southern side of the bight, covered at the summit
with low trees and bushes, and on the sides and all
around by wood. At the foot of the cliff Bischoff built
his house. It was a perfect model of neatness and
cleanliness. It was of stone, and formed two storeys.

tobacco, and other things which the Dutchman grew;
and now and then the schooner brought a Dutch paper,
which delighted the heart of the owner of New Rotterdam
for months, yea, even years. A whole week did it take
Andrew Brock to load and unload, with the assistance
of his crew and the well-fed negroes of the establish-
ment. But Mein Herr never grumbled. He had some
one to drink with him, to smoke with him, and to sit
with him. Not that when Captain Brock sat down
before him they ever roused themselves to any greater
exchange of intellectuality than a few remarks relative
to the Hollands or the tobacco. But then there is
sociability in company which even a silent Dutchman
can appreciate, and Von Bischoff was on such occasions
eminently happy.
The upper storey was all bedrooms, as were the garrets;
while on the lower was a dining-room, a smoking-room,
a large kitchen, and one apartment into which no man
but the master of the house ever ventured. It was
barred with iron, and the only window opened into a
passage. But no one thence could see the inside, the
glass being stained, and heavy curtains further obscur-
ing the vision. The door was always carefully locked.
Bischoff had numerous servants, male and female,
white and black. He grew his own vegetables, reared
his own cattle, had a poultry-yard, a splendid dairy, as
clean as an old maid's parlour. He lived well did Mein
Herr. He rose at six, took a walk round his garden,
looked at his tulips-if in season-scolded his gardener
For some years previous to the commencement of

cakes, and then smoked a pipe by way of promoting
digestion. At eleven, after a stroll through the house
-a stroll always accompanied by numerous grunts and
objurgations at the laziness and extravagance of ser-
vants-he took his schnapps, as he called his first glass
of spirits, and then read the last Dutch paper with rare
gusto, though he had almost worn it out, and it was at
length nearly two years old. But until another came it
was the retired merchant's latest intelligence; and as in
those days no one, especially Dutchmen, were ever in a
hurry for news, it served the purpose at least of our
modern Sunday paper. At one he dined, with an appe-
tite which to us degenerate mortals would seem dreadful
in its vehemence. But Von Bischoff-Peter was his
Christian name-looked upon dining as a duty, and
never moved from table in less than an hour. He ate
his beef and cabbage, his bacon and beans, his venison,
his fish, with clockwork regularity, and quaffed his beer
with equal respect for the interior mechanism of his
stomach. Then he made a glass of punch, and in fine
weather went down to the port of New Rotterdam, as
his estate was called. We said the port. This requires
explanation.
looked at them gravely, and with some little alarm,
and at length found courage to open them. He read
them with a solemn countenance, but with tears glisten-
ing in his eyes, and always made up his mind to write
an answer next time. But though Peter could indite
with facility an invoice or a business - letter, an
epistle which had to deal in sentiment and feeling
was something out of the way, and required con-
sideration. And so Peter went on considering for
three years; and little Katherine, the author of the
documents in question, received no other reply to her
affectionate outbursts of filial duty save promises to
write next time, kind wishes, and handsome presents.
'Katherine is eighteen, she says,' exclaimed Andrew
Brock one day, taking his pipe away from his mouth
for a minute-' and thinks it time she should come
home.'
'Eighteen!' replied Peter, opening his little eyes to
their extreme width, and looking in truth unutterable
things-eighteen! Her mother was married at that
age.'
I'll marry her,' said Andrew Brock gravely. 'She
is pretty, and as lively as a kitten.'
Ah!' responded Peter, without noticing the offer of
his skipper; lively! Just like her mother, I suppose.
These English have quicksilver in their veins. But she
is a woman now: she must come home.'
'Give me the order to receive her,' continued Captain
Brock, who understood clearly that his overtures were
rejected for the present, and, like his patron, was not
inclined to waste words in explanation.
The Dutchman's garden went right down to the edge
of the water. It had been chosen for the purpose
where the bank was high and steep, and a very decent
quay had been knocked up with a few cedar piles
driven into the water, and a number of planks laid
down from them to the land. A little bower had been
erected close to the port, and here Peter would take his
glass of grog and his pipe, and spreading himself out in
a leathern cushioned arm-chair, would gaze upon the
water in the direction of the capital of the state of
New York. Once a month a methodical schooner
would, about two o'clock on the first day of the month,
come in sight, wind and weather permitting, and about
three would moor alongside the wharf, with the most
praiseworthy punctuality. But Andrew Brock was
even a more jog-trot Dutchman than Peter von Bis-
choff. He was never known to hurry himself, or ever
to be behindhand, when he could help it. He could
not be induced to understand why wind and tides
should ever vary, or at all events should not be per-
fectly regular in their variations. And yet if the wind
was against him, Andrew took it quietly; he was not,
like an English madcap of a sailor, going to bother
himself with beating-up the channel against the wind,
wearing out ship and tackle, but waited until he could
sail in a reasonable and methodical manner, in his usual
course, with his usual sails set. He brought Von Bis-
choff his letters, his supplies of tea, sugar, and tobacco;
and took away bacon, and cheese, and corn, and leaf- | capable.
Mein Herr did all that was necessary: sent the money
for her schooling, a female servant to accompany her,
and two lines to his daughter requesting her to come
home, and declaring himself very glad to see her.
There was a little hypocrisy in this, for Peter felt
considerable uneasiness about the matter. During the
two years that his young English wife had lived his
life had been miserable. She was a joyous, young,
merry thing, who would have given untold happiness
to any man who could have appreciated her. She was
always singing, dancing, or running about. She could
never stand still, and the methodical Dutchman was
miserable. Worst of all, she made him laugh, and that
made his stomach ache, he said, which was an alarming
symptom of future illness. About a year after giving
birth to a lovely child, Mary Bischoff was drowned
while crossing over to New Rotterdam.

catch a glimpse of a large fish by the side, when her
foot slipped, overboard she went, and being swept
away by the rapid current, was seen no more.

'Mein Gott!' he cried aloud, 'I am very sorry. But
there is comfort in all things: I shall be quiet now.
What a pity she was so lively. But she would have
killed me; so I suppose it is all for the best.'
Was it the wind or was it a sigle that made the
Dutchman start? But though he rose and looked
around he saw nothing. But his unfeeling speech had
sufficient effect on his feelings to make him believe
that the ghost of his drowned Mary had reproached
him in this gentle way. This belief made him turn to
little Kate with sorrowful love. But soon he could
not bear the sight of her. Before a week the memory
of the winsome ways, the pleasant smile, the jocund
laugh of his charming wife had melted the heart of the
young Dutchman, and Peter would willingly have once
more lost all his peace and tranquillity to have been
teazed even into leanness by his pretty Mary. But it
was too late. The water yielded not up its dead, and
Kate was sent to nurse, and after that to school.
Some years beyond this, Peter, whose ruling passion
was money, was accosted by a strange sailor, who made
him a proposition. What it was no man ever knew.
But Peter grew suddenly wealthy, lent money to all
who needed it, retired from business, and took up his
residence at New Rotterdam. For some years he seemed
far from happy; he was always on the look-out, as if
for some one. But by degrees, as no one came, he
grew easier in his mind, and at last seemed to forget
every cause of unhappiness, and waxed fatter, being
more contented and satisfied than ever. He still lent
money to good houses; but Captain Andrew transacted
his business for him, collected his accounts, had his
bonds signed, and did everything which was needful.
Every month he brought home all that had been
repaid in interest or principal during the month,
and took back all that Peter consented to put out
to interest. Richer and richer grew our Dutchman,
for not only his money but his vast estates brought
him in profit.
The 1st of May was the day on which Katherine
was expected home. It was a bright and sunny
morning. Peter ate his dinner with his usual method,
after ordering a luxurious tea to be ready at three
o'clock, the hour at which the schooner was expected
to arrive. At two precisely he was in his bower with
pipe and glass. He lit the one and took a sip of the
other, and then looked around. His pipe dropped
from his mouth and almost out of his hand as he saw
two schooners heading for the port of New Rotterdam,
at the usual distance. They were so exactly alike that
Peter was puzzled to know which was which. What
I could this mean? There was some mystery about the
matter. There was, he was sure, going to be trouble
and vexation, and his equanimity would surely be
disturbed.
'That it should happen on this very 1st of May
17-,' he cried; the birthday'-
But why is he so pale and trembling; why does he
lay down his pipe; why does he gulp down his drink,
and, buttoning his pockets, assume an air of sullen
defiance, as if prepared to defend them with terrible
energy?
'My Heavens!' he exclaimed, it is the 1st of May
17-; Katherine's birthday, and the anniversary-
What will become of me?'
The usually rubicund and merry face of the Dutchman
grew pale, all the commonly suffused red congregating
on the top of his large nose, his eyes twinkled with angry
vehemence, and an awful frown of alarming portent
collected on his brow. His glance never left the two
schooners, which came on exactly abreast, with their
flags flying, and heading exactly for the port of New
Rotterdam. Peter now recognised that of Brock by
the oft-mended sails, those of the other being spick-and-
span new of white duck, while the vessel itself had a
smart and natty appearance. Mein Herr von Bischoff
|
sank down upon his arm-chair in deep thought. His
unlit pipe was between his teeth, his replenished glass
was untouched. He could distinguish something on
the deck of Andrew Brock's schooner whieh made his
heart leap. It was a figure which carried him back
sixteen years. It was the same size, in the same dress;
and the Dutchman could have sworn it was her who,
after twenty-four months of wedded life, had found a
watery grave. The schooner came nearer and nearer,
and Peter Bischoff rose as usual to walk down to the
very edge of the water. The small craft was brought
up in the wind, stood still, and then was with wonderful
rapidity moored by the negroes to the shore.
My father,' said a soft, ringing, silvery voice in
Peter's car, that made him look round in amazement,
for he could have sworn it was the voice of the dead--
my father, here is your Katherine, your Kate.'
6
Merciful Heaven! It was the same hair, the same
eyes, the same voice, the same form; and Peter turned
away and wept bitterly, Dutchman and phlegmatic as
he was.
What is the matter?' asked Katherine, much
amazed.
'You are so like what your poor mother was,' replied
the father.
'Dear papa, and do you mourn for her still?' said
his rosy-checked, fair-haired, light, airy - stepped
daughter.
'I do. I never shall forget the wicked relief I felt at
being quiet. But that very unnatural joy was my
punishment. Years, my child, had healed the wound';
but you have reopened it.'
O what a smile of unutterable love came from that
child's face as the Dutchman thus spoke of her mother!
She caught him round the neck, she kissed him, she
laughed, she chattered like a monkey, and then ran
with noisome glee to see what the house was like.
'Well, Captain Andrew, what is the meaning of this
schooner following you, and anchoring 200 yards off
our port?'
"The devil blister its black sides!' said Andrew Brock
fiercely it has followed me from New York like a
leech. It has never been fifty yards apart; sometimes
it would come so close I thought we should touch.
It is a richy Englishman, I know: the captain is a
little handsome fellow with smart curly whiskers; I
fancy he has come in chase of Katherine.'
'Little man, smart curly whiskers, in love with my
daughter: der teufel, I will kill him!' and Peter Bischoff
looked as angry as he had done some hours before. But
I don't understand such impudence. What can he
want?'
There lay the strange schooner in the stream, riding
at anchor about 200 yards distant. It was an elegant
and graceful craft, with low hull, tall, raking masts,
white duck-sails, a clean, well holy-stoned deck, and all
that air of natty seamanship which is peculiarly English.
Peter shook his head, and looked as if he expected to
see some sign of life on board. But not a soul was on
deck-not a sign of life was visible. The schooner lay
stilly and silently at anchor, as if wholly abandoned
by man.
"Very odd,' said the Dutch skipper.
'Very,' replied Peter: come and take tea.'
Away walked our two portly friends up the garden
towards the house, musing with very different feelings
relative to the advent of the strange schooner. The
Dutch skipper saw only a rival in love and trade in
the English sailor, but Peter saw something far more
serious; but what it was, unfortunately, he could
not communicate to any one. They found Katherine
roaring with laughter at the astonishment of the negro
female servants when she began upsetting a whole
system of her father's arrangements, of which she did
not approve. First a chair did not please her; then a
table; then a heap of old china was not in a position to

satisfy her; and with her own hands and those of her
alarmed assistants all was in process of alteration.
As Peter entered the negresses stopped, looking at
him with an air of uneasy doubt.
Make haste, Darkness,' said Katherine, with her
rich merry laugh, that still made her father's heart leap,
and still moistened his eyes.
6
Obey your new mistress,' exclaimed Peter quietly:
'I give no further orders here. Katherine, my daughter,
rules the house.'.
The negresses laughingly and cheerfully prepared to
obey; but Kate had changed her mind for the minute,
and checking them, bade them prepare tea. Down sat
the two Dutchmen, one on each side of Kate-the one
to admire and gaze at her in fixed silence, the other
to make desperate love. Peter was a handsome man
of forty, and would have looked well, making himself
into a beau-but the skipper was as ugly a man as
you would find in the land, too fond by far of his
glass, which Peter did not altogether abuse, though
he, too, might more wisely have been a little more
abstinent. So Kate laughed heartily at his compliments;
asked him if he was not ashamed to dream of marriage
at his age, when he should be thinking of a future
life-a man of fifty is quite ancient in the eyes of
a boarding-school miss of eighteen-and only became
more uproarious in her mirth when he got a little angry.
Peter would have laughed if he could, but he had
a dim perception now of all he had really lost sixteen
years before: he knew now what joy might have been
his if his wife had been spared to him; and again, as it
did ever, his heart reproached him with that unfeeling
speech of his the evening after her death.
The tea seemed never likely to finish: Peter kept
asking for fresh cups, and fresh slices of hot cake, and
eating them slowly, as if he never tired of being helped
by his beloved child, whose little hands, stirring his
tea and cutting his cake, seemed to make it twice as
pleasant. Andrew Brock tried to imitate him, but he
was too fond of brandy and water to be able to do so.
It was in vain that gallantry made him try a third
cup: he could not manage it. About seven, Kate,
who was tired with her journey, retired to rest; and
Andrew Brock, for the same reason, followed her ex-
ample. Peter Bischoff remained alone with his pipe
and his glasses.
There sat the Dutchman in his cloud of smoke, puff-
ing away out of a bowl of huge dimensions, and quaffing
his grog with more gusto than usual. He was not
happy. The return of his daughter had brought to his
mind the days of his courtship-all that was pleasant
in his married life, all its charms, all the excellences
and pleasant qualities of Mary Bischoff, while none of
her faults were remembered: then he thought of the
anniversary of the 1st of May-to him one always of
painful import; and as he smoked and drank the good
man dozed away, half asleep, half awake, with all
manner of queer beings around him. Presently some
one seemed to call him, but so faintly he could scarcely
hear, and he fell quite into a heavy slumber.
'Peter Bischoff, Peter Bischoff!' said a voice again
in a shrill tone which made him start.
Peter sat upright, and looked wildly around; he then
clearly distinguished some one tapping at the window
in a mysterious way. As usual, all the servants were
gone to bed, and Peter Bischoff was alone.
'Who is there?' said he in a low tone.
'I,' replied a half-shrill, half-gruff voice- the sailor
of the island.'
"
Peter Bischoff groaned; but seeming to resign him-
self to his fate, went to the door, unbarred it, and gave
admission to the stranger. A well-made little man, of
about six-and-thirty, with light curly whiskers, a cap, a
round jacket, and loose trousers, and a sash supporting
pistols and dirk, walked quietly in, entered the smok-
ing-room, sat himself down in the portly Dutchman's
arm-chair, and looked at him with his clear, piercing
blue eyes with an air of considerable curiosity and
surprise.
'How odd you look!' said the English sailor laugh-
ing; as if you expected me, yet did not like the visit.
'Quite prepared to see you,' replied the Dutchman.
6
'How you're changed in sixteen years!' said the
other: 'fat, gray-haired, red nose-can't say you're
improved.'
"Mere matter of taste,' said the Dutchman.
'Exactly. But to business. Do you recollect the
1st of May fifteen years since?'
'Yes; there must have been such a day,' observed
the Dutchman.
'Glad you are willing to own that. But allow me to
refresh your memory:-In the year 17-, sixteen years
ago, living in a small hut on Long Island, I discovered
a treasure in my garden, buried there by pirates, I
suppose '
So you said at the time,' mused the Dutchman.
'And so I say now!' exclaimed the English sailor
shrilly. I should have declared the discovery to the
state, but I didn't. I thought a provision for my old
age of more importance than the enriching a cor-
poration; so I looked round for an honest, upright, but
hard man, who could make the best of my money until
I wanted it, and rumour brought me to you.?.
'Exactly,' groaned the Dutchman.
'I came over to you in my schooner, in which I
traded down the coast, and told you that I had made
the discovery. You never advised me to make it
public, but offered me per cent. for my money as
long as I liked. I preferred wandering just then to
settling down, and I accepted: I brought you over to
the island, handed you the money, you gave me a
receipt: here it is--I want my money. The 1st of
May 17-is not yet come; the sixteen years when it
was to be yours if unclaimed are not past.'
'Exactly,' said the Dutchman.
'You are ready, I suppose?' exclaimed the English
sailor: L.10,000 net at 5 per cent. for fourteen clear
years is L.17,000.'
"Mein Gott!' said the Dutchman with a deep sigh.
'I understand: it is not pleasant to give up so round
a sum. Suppose we strike a bargain?'
'Hein!' cried Peter, rousing himself.
'What do you say to a swap, Mein Herr von Bischoff?
Your daughter against the L.17,000?'
See you blistered first!' cried the Dutchman in a
loud and thundering voice.
'What!' said the sailor, much surprised, 'you prefer
your daughter to your money?'
6
'Of course I do, young man!' exclaimed Peter von
Bischoff; and you shall strip me of my fortune ere you
shall rob me of her.'
'Suppose I denounce you as having secreted treasure?'
said the sailor gruffly.
'Do so, and the teufel take you!' thundered the
Dutchman.
'Pay me my money then,' said the sailor: 'here is
your receipt. Here is the sack in which I intend to
carry away my gold.'
The Dutchman looked fiercely at him, but did not
move. To part with L.17,000 was dreadful, but to
promise his daughter to a man he didn't know was
worse.
'Well,' asked the sailor, 'what do you decide?'
'Nothing!' said the Dutchman in angry embarrass-
ment.
'My dear papa,' exclaimed Kate, bursting into the
room, 'what is the matter? I hear you quarrelling with
Captain Andrew: what has he been doing?'
Go to bed,' said Peter Bischoff much annoyed,
my dear Kate! I am engaged in business with a
stranger '-
'A stranger!' cried Katherine in wild and passionate

accents; do you say a stranger? Oh, my mother!
why have you come in this disguise?'
Your mother! What did you say?' said Peter,
pale and trembling.
'Yes, my dear father!' replied Katherine; and after
what you said to-day, you must indeed be proud and
happy.'
Proud and happy!' said Mary Bischoff sternly.
"Then why have I been dead to him for sixteen years?
Why, when I fell overboard and was picked up, and
was coming home, did I hear him say, "It is all for the
best?""
'Because I was a fool; because I knew not the
happiness I lost that day; because I loved my ease
and quiet, I seemed glad for a moment. But explain
all this. I shall go mad! How are you here? Are you
Mary, or are you the sailor? What is the object of
your lending me money? But no; I am an idiot to
ask you. This is some trick. It would be too much
happiness-too much'-
'Do I hear aright?' cried Mary, looking at her
husband and her child. 'Is it possible that you really
love me?'
'Mother,' said Kate solemnly, if you had heard and
seen him this morning you would not have doubted
him; and drawing the sham sailor on one side she
spoke earnestly in a whisper.
In a minute more the sailor's whiskers fell off, his
cap was removed, and but that the face was browned,
a little plumper, and the form a little rounder, Peter
von Bischoff saw before him the same loved being
who, sixteen years before, had disappeared beneath the
waters of the Hudson. But Peter had no time to
speak, for Kate drew her away. Overcome by his
emotions, the merchant sank into his arm-chair.
'It is my wife or her ghost, as sure as I'm a Dutch-
man!' he cried.
In a few minutes Kate and Mary returned, the latter
having hurriedly changed her garb, and Peter knew her
once more. He took both their hands, unable to speak,
and gazed at them with surprise and affection. His
little eyes stood out prominently in his head; he looked
first at one and then at the other, and then drawing his
wife to his bosom, kissed her earnestly.
Tell me all about it,' said he, rising with a tremen-
dous effort, and offering her a chair. My dear love,
welcome home!'
'To say, Peter, that I am surprised is to say little.
I am very happy, very proud, even after so many
years, to be united to my husband. When I fell over-
board sixteen years ago I was swept away by the
current instead of sinking, and was picked up by a
fisherman whose canoe you could not see in the dark.
I lay all night in his hut, nursed by his wife and
daughter. Towards the afternoon I was better, and
was brought home in the canoe. The man set me on
shore at the low beach, and I walked up here with the
wicked intention of frightening you with my ghost.
Just as I reached the bower I heard you speak. Never
shall I forget that moment. It seemed that my girlish.
spirits made you unhappy, and that you looked upon
my death as rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved
never to let you know I was alive: my pride revolted
at the idea of being a burden to a man who rejoiced
at my supposed death. I would have taken my child;
but I loved you still, and wanted to see my child well
brought up. You knew that my father had been a
sailor, and even that it was rumoured he had been
hard upon the Spaniards in the Indies. I had been
often long voyages with him. I assumed the dress of a
man at once, as the best disguise and the surest way of
getting on. I shipped on board a trading boat which
went to Long Island, where my father had died. I
sought his house, now mine, and made it my head-
quarters. Arranging the house one day I found a
letter to myself hidden in an old box. It was put there
in the prevision that his daughter might marry and not
be happy. It told me of the hidden treasure. I saw in
this unexpected windfall a future fortune for my child.
I knew you to be a man capable of doubling it. You
know the rest. But I could not bear not to see my
Katherine. I went to the school-the mistress knew me
well-I told my story, and she agreed to let me see my
child as often as I liked. My child loved me dearly.
Every voyage-and they were only along the coast-I
put off my male garb, and spent some hours with Kate.
When she was old enough to understand, I explained
the reason of my parting with you, but, as you well
know, without seeking to diminish the child's affection
for its father.'
'God bless you!' said the Dutchman.
'And so you mean to take back your runaway wife?'
replied Mary, sidling up to him.
'Mein Gott! you don't want to go?' exclaimed Peter
anxiously.
But I'm as merry and wild as ever. Kate and I
romp together like two kittens.'
'So much the better,' said the Dutchman, whose eyes
looked very moist. The house is yours: do as you
like; only forgive me my words-I did not mean them
and you may dance on my head if you like.'
'I do forgive you, Peter. I would do so simply to
quiet those imploring little eyes of Kate's,' replied
Mary; but I do so from my heart-on one condition.'
Anything you like,' said Peter with enthusiasm.
6
The fact is, when I came here it was not with any
intention of making myself known. I had heard it
rumoured that you intended to marry Kate to old
Andrew Brock; at all events, he said so'-
'Old porpoise,' growled Peter indignantly.
'I am glad to hear you had no such intention.'
'See him drowned first!' said Mein Herr von Bischoff.
'For I, my dear husband, have one ready for Kate.
IIe is a young Englishman-a clever, handsome, lively,
pleasant fellow. You like ease; he likes work. Make
him manager of your estates: you have plenty of
money; you can enlarge and improve them'-
But it is your money'-
'No, Peter; it is yours in trust for Kate. She will
be happy to share our home. By and by we can build
her a house on the port, and then years hence when we
really do die '-
6
Hush, mother!' cried Kate eagerly. Talk of
anything else.'
'We'll talk of your marriage then'-
'Yes!' exclaimed Peter, who was in a rapturous state
of mind. 'And won't we dance, and have a fine time
of it!' and the Dutchman actually rose, seized his wife
and daughter by the hand, and, amid shouts of laughter,
began dancing round the room. They tried to stop
him, but in vain; he was too much for them. At length,
however, he was out of breath, and sank into an
arm-chair.
'Let's have some supper,' said he suddenly, and
drink to the health of the mistress of the house.
Holla! oh! Up there, Gratz, Joseph, William, Ebony,
Alice. Be stirring; look alive!' and seizing his
walking-stick, the Dutchman began banging the table
with a settled energy which made his wife smile. It
was a strong proof of his love; for he hereby declared
that he abandoned willingly all his ideas of phlegmatic
comfort, and authorised those he loved to be henceforth
as uproariously mirthful as they pleased.
"Your father is going mad!' said Mary laughing.
With happiness, mamma,' replied Kate, joining their
hands, and gazing at them with such an exquisite smile
of joy as made both embrace her fondly.
A happy man from that day was Mein Herr von
Bischoff. He never looked grave again, for fear of
making his family fancy he was tired of their mirth.
When he unexpectedly found the house filled during
the next ten years by little children-both his daughter's

and his own--he certainly did look at them with some-
what of a serious expression of countenance; but when
he caught his wife or daughter's eye fixed on him, he
would laugh heartily, and winking at both, exclaim
with genuine delight: It's all for the best!'
THE MAGUEY OF MEXICO.
FULL five millions of people drink the sap of the
maguey, a fact which of itself entitles this interesting
plant to a more generous description than has yet
appeared in the note-book of the traveller. We shall
venture a few particulars from memory.
The appearance of the maguey is picturesque in the
extreme, not yielding in this respect either to the
palm or the tree-fern. On seeing it for the first time
the traveller reins up his horse, and gazes admiringly
on its thick dark leaves. He feels that he is in a
foreign land-a land of vegetable giants. He feels,
too, that he is in Mexico; for on no other part of the
American continent does the great aloe attain its full
and colossal proportions.
It is difficult by 'word-painting' to present the coup
d'œil of the maguey; but most persons have seen the aloe
of our botanic gardens, or the plant of the pine-apple,
and these suggest the idea, though somewhat feebly, of
its general appearance. On looking at the maguey you
see nothing but its leaves, or rather blades, for such
huge, thick masses of vegetable matter can hardly be
termed leaves. Let us call them blades then. Popu-
larly speaking, there is no stem-that is, there is no
visible stem-the great flower-stalk being quite another
thing, which we shall describe hereafter. The blades
appear to grow directly out of the ground, or out of
something slightly elevated above the surface; which,
however, is hidden by their bases that lap each other
around it. If you amputate the blades close by their
bases, you will discover this 'something' to be a large
mass of fibrous and succulent vegetable matter, exactly
of the form of an ostrich-egg or cocoa-nut, its lower
extremity resting upon the ground, to which it is held
fast by a number of stout branching roots. This is the
true stem; but, to be more expressive to the popular
ear, we shall take the liberty of terming it the
'nucleus' of the plant. In a full-grown maguey this
nucleus will be about twenty inches in its vertical or
longest diameter, and at least twelve inches measured
horizontally. It consists of two distinct parts: the
outer or rind, and the heart (corazon), which is contained
within. The rind is tough and fibrous, and about an
inch in thickness; the heart is a mass of succulent
matter, very similar, both in appearance and consist-
ency, to the flesh of a firm Swedish turnip. It can be
scooped out and removed, as we shall see presently,
without causing the immediate death of the plant.
Let us now turn to the leaves or blades. In a large
specimen of the plant, each one of these is about eight
feet in length, and twelve inches in breadth at the base,
where it is widest. It is also thickest at this point,
where it is at least four inches through. From its
base the blade tapers regularly, lessening both in width
and thickness till it ends in a sharp point. Neither
surface is a plane. The upper one is concave or
troughed, though the trough disappears towards the
point; and the under surface, on the contrary, exhibits
a convex or ridged form, the convexity nearly corre-
sponding to the hollow of the other side. A cross
section of the leaf, near its base, would not be unlike
the representation on paper of an obtuse-angled and
isosceles spherical triangle. Both surfaces are perfectly
smooth, and of a uniform dark-green, not far from the
shade of the common bulrush. Where the plant grows
in a low, rich soil the green is still more obscure, and
on close inspection the surface will be found delicately
mottled with patches of a purplish-black.
In botanical language, the leaves of the maguey are
armed. Along each edge is a row of small claws, like
fish-hooks, set about four inches from each other, and
giving to the leaf a serrated appearance. These claws
curve inwards towards the nucleus of the plant. They
are of a dark-blood colour, keen at their points, and as
hard as horn itself. They are firmly set-sufficiently
so to take the piece out of your coat or skin, should
you be so imprudent, after getting hooked upon them,
as to drag yourself hurriedly away. But the maguey
is still further armed. Each blade is tipped with a
hard, thorny spikelet, four inches in length, as black as
ebony, as sharp as a needle, and not unlike the quill of
the porcupine. These, with the claws already described,
constitute the defensive armour of the plant. Without
them, however, it would not be so easily wounded; for
the leaves, though soft and pliable, are sufficiently
tough and fibrous to prevent their being readily crushed
or broken. It requires a smart stroke of the sabre to
amputate one of them near the base. I have often
made the experiment. It is somewhat of a feat.
Imagine, then, some thirty or more of these huge
blades radiating from a common centre, their spikelets
pointing to every quarter of the heavens, and even to
the earth itself-for in many instances the lower leaves
curve gracefully over until their tips rest upon the
surface of the soil; I say, imagine this, and you will
have before your mind's eye a faint idea of the appear-
ance of the great Agave Americana. You will not see
the spheroidal nucleus I have described. It is hidden
by the leaves, whose broad bases grow out from its
surface, sessile, and lapping one another. You will see
nothing but the huge green blades rising above the head
of the horseman, and radiating chevaux-de-frise-like
from each other.
Such is the aspect of the maguey in its ordinary
state. It presents an altered appearance when it has
flowered. The leaves still remain as before; but out
from their centre, and partially sheathed by the two
or three which point vertically, shoots a tall stem of
three inches in diameter, and between twenty and
thirty feet in height. This is the flower-stalk, and its
top is ornamented with thick clusters of bright yellow
flowers. It is somewhat irregular in its outline; that
is, it is not exactly cylindrical, though nearly so. It is
semi-ligneous, its surface exhibiting slight grooves,
with here and there small nodes. It is destitute of
leaflets or branches, except at and near the top, where
the blossoms hang out on their numerous pedicles.
Considering that this tree-like stem shoots vertically
up to a height of nearly thirty feet, and that its top is
crowned with a fragrant cluster of flowers, it will easily
be imagined that it adds to the imposing appearance of
the plant. It certainly does so; and it is in this stage
of its growth that the maguey is usually pictured by
travellers. Yet, strange to say, you may journey from
one end of Mexico to the other without seeing half-a-
dozen plants in the state of flowering. The reason is
obvious. The maguey is not cultivated for ornament,
but for use-the use of its sap, which can be extracted
from a single plant to the value of ten or twelve dollars.
Since the flower-stalk would destroy, or rather mono-
polise the sap for its own nourishment, the latter of
course could not be extracted, and the value of the
plant would be lost. Under these circumstances, it
is evident that nature is seldom permitted to carry
out her design-never, in fact, except by the accident
of neglect on the part of the cultivator, or in some wild
spot where the maguey may chance to 'blush unseen.'
We come to the geography of the agave. Although
Mexico is peculiarly the country of the maguey, an
aloe resembling it is found in all tropical regions, and
even distributed to some extent through the latitudes
of the temperate zone. It is indigenous in Spain, and
will grow in the climate of Britain; but in no country
that I am aware of, excepting Mexico, has any attempt
been made to extract its sap as an exhilarating beverage.

occupy.
The wild maguey makes its appearance upon the
northern plains of Mexico, upon the less elevated
plateaux of Chihuahua, Sonora, and the Valley Del
Norté. Its roots and leaves are also eaten by the
Indians who roam over these plains the Navajos,
Comanches, and Apachés. By them it is baked, along
with horse-flesh, in hot stone-ovens sunk in the ground;
and thus cooked, it forms one of their most favourite
dishes.
But the most singular fact in the geography of the
maguey is, that although principally found within the
limits of the tropics, it is not a tropical plant; that is
to say, it does not thrive to perfection in the hot lands
(tierras calientes)-the region of the palm. The surface-
formation of Mexico is peculiar. Along both oceans
that border it extends a belt of low land, hot and febrile
in its climate, and altogether tropical in its character.
Having crossed this belt towards the interior, the
traveller ascends at first gradually through the foot-
hills of mountains, then more abruptly through the
mountains themselves, till at an elevation of 6000 or Let us now return to the true maguey, which we

bitants; and this is the true region of the maguey.
Here alone is it seen in full luxuriance, and here only
is it cultivated for the use of man.
The aloe of the tierras calientes is altogether a
different affair. It is the wild maguey or mezcal-
plant, and bears but slight resemblance to its gigantic
cousin of the tierras templados. It is similar, however,
in generic properties. It possesses the same spheroidal
nucleus, though much smaller, and sends up the tall
flower-stalk. You may see this species in flower at all
times, for, like other wild plants of the forest, it is
allowed to bud and blossom when it will. The most
striking difference between the two will be noticed in
the leaves. Those of the wild species are much more
slender, and there are three or four times as many of
them to a single plant. They are more thickly barbed
along the edges-so much so indeed, that where a
patch of wild magueys covers the ground, it is no easy
matter to make one's way through them; hence the
skin-savers and leathern-leggings worn by all the
rancheros of the tierras calientes. I remember having
a pair of military overalls torn to pieces in a single
day's scouting by the claws of the wild maguey. No
cloth can hold out against them.
The leaves of the wild plant, from the fact of their
being more slender, curve still more gracefully than
those of the cultivated species. In colour the two
species differ essentially. Instead of the dark-green
which distinguishes the blades of the upland maguey,
these exhibit a surface of mottled-red and whitish-
green. Frequently the whole plant appears of a bright
scarlet, as if burned to this hue by the hot rays that
constantly pour down upon it. A thicket of them,
which is often seen, or even a single plant of this
colour, bursting suddenly upon the eye of the traveller,
presents a most striking and vivid picture.
There is no use made of the wild maguey-at least
it is not cultivated to this end. It is indigenous in the
arid districts of the tierra caliente; and in some parts
grows in such plenty as to form the characteristic
plant of the tropical underwood. It flourishes side by
side with the cactus and the acacia, the three together
forming impenetrable jungles called in the language of
Mexico chapparals. Sometimes its sap is extracted and
distilled into a fiery drink - --a species of whisky-
named Merical (mezcal.) The Indians have a way of
roasting, or rather baking its roots and part of its
leaves, so as to yield a sweet and agreeable esculent.
among the wild magueys; and when I afterwards
climbed up to the table-lands and beheld for the first
time the cultivated plant, I was impressed with the
idea that I had never seen it before. Strange, too, that
at the elevation where the latter is first met with, the
wild species disappears; and their line of conjunction,
if I mistake not, will be found to correspond very
nearly with the highest line of the palm. But it is
upon the high plateaux, 7000 feet above sea-level,
where the maguey attains its greatest strength and
luxuriance. As one ascends the mountains above this
elevation, it gradually appears more stunted and worth-
less. It might be supposed, from the temperature of
the table-lands, that it would thrive in the latitude of
the temperate zones; but such is not the case.
It can
be cultivated to no purpose in the United States; and
even in Northern Mexico, outside the tropic, it again
assumes the form and aspect of the wild species.
Notwithstanding the objection to the temperate zone,
it is not extreme heat which the plant seeks for, but a
uniform temperature throughout the year-a climate never
warmer than an English summer, and never colder
than an English spring. Such a one does it find on
the great intertropical plateaux of the Mexican Andes.
It is there alone that it is cultivated-in many
places being the principal object of agricultural in-
dustry. In the vallés of Puebla, Mexico, Toluca,
Guanajuato, around the pyramid of Cholula, and on
the Llanos de Assam by Tlascalla, large plantations
may be seen entirely occupied with the cultivation of
the maguey. In these, as well as in other plains, it
may also be seen planted in double or triple rows along
the edges of the maize or wheat fields, or bordering the
green meadows, thus forming an ornamental enclosure
as well as a valuable addition to the property of the
farmer. In most of the plateaux of Mexico timber is
scarce, and fencing is a costly operation. In such cases
the maguey serves an important purpose in helping
out the enclosure. A double row of plants, with their
long spiky blades locking each other, make of them-
selves a hedge sufficiently formidable to turn both
horses and cattle. But whether planted for the sake
of fencing a farm, or whether forming of itself the
staple product of the proprietor, the plants are care-
fully tended, and the sap of each drawn from it in its
proper season.
The planting is a simple operation. The young
magueys are set in the ground at a distance of about

two yards apart, just wide enough to prevent them
from crowding each other when they arrive at full
size. They are kept clear of weeds, and digging
around them is sometimes beneficial. Should any of
the blades be wounded, or wilted from blight, which is
sometimes the case, the dead part is amputated with a
large pruning-knife. And thus they are tended with
no great labour or expense for a space of about eight
years, during which time they make no return to the
proprietor, for as yet not one of the plants has yielded
sap. The time, however, of productiveness has arrived.
This is at the end of the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth, or sometimes even of the twelfth year. The
irregularity depends upon soil, climate, and other inci-
dentals; but eight years may be taken as the average.
The plant now threatens to shoot,' but it is closely
watched by the thuchiquero (klatch-ee-ká-ro); and
when that hour arrives at which the great flower-
stem should spring up out of the nucleus, the top of
the latter is cut off, and the maguey is tapped. We
shall describe this process anon.
It is plain from all this that to create a new maguey
plantation would require a somewhat patient sort of
mind. In many cases it would be planting for pos-
teritysowing that others might reap.' Even in
beginning a plantation of magueys, the ground must
not all be occupied the first year. A portion of young
plants must be set out each succeeding year, until
those first planted have commenced yielding sap; and
even when these have been sucked dry, which is
accomplished in three months from the time of their
being tapped, their wilted and wrinkled bodies are
dragged from the ground, and a fresh generation of
juveniles are stuck into their places. In this way a
constant succession of ripening is kept up, and the
sweet aguamiel (honey-water) flows on for ever.
wound his bare legs. All this he does with the nimble-
ness and silence of a cat. He arrives at length before
a plant that has been tapped, and halting in front of it
lays down his calabash. The plant thus tapped (cor-
tada) is easily distinguished from its fellows. It has a
ruinous look. Two or three of its leaves that have
been cut off lie withering beside it; and over the
ground is scattered a quantity of whitish scrapings,
exactly resembling horse-radish when brought to table.
The ovate nucleus is partially exposed to view, and
you perceive that a small segment has been cut from
its top. A large stone is resting upon it, or a piece
of the butend of one of the amputated leaves.
The tlachiquero lifts off the stone, and you perceive
that the nucleus is hollow. The heart (corazon) has
been scraped out, though not all of it, and the thick
rind remaining forms the sides of a regular spheroidal
cavity or jar. You perceive that half way down to the
bottom of this jar some of the heart still remains, but
portions will be removed from day to day. You will
perceive, also, that in this cavity there is a quantity of
a clear crystalline liquid: taste it. It is as sweet as
honey-water, and both in taste and appearance exactly
resembles the juice of the sugar-cane or the sap of
the maple-tree. It is the sap of the maguey; it is the
aguamiel. You will observe that there is nearly half
a gallon of it (remember that it is morning, and this is
the first visit of the tlachiquero), and that quantity is
the collected flowings of the whole night.
The tlachiquero now takes up the calabash, which is
called the acojoté (a-ko-hú-té.) This is a curious imple-
ment, and deserves a word. It is an oblong gourd,
nearly three feet in length, and hollow of course. One
of the ends is tipped with a horn open at the point;
there is also a hole in the other, which is the larger or
butend; and the acojoté therefore is nothing more than
a rude suction-pipe, and that is its purpose.
Having laid hold of this instrument, the tlachiquero
placing his lips to the other end, by a well-known hy-
draulic law, draws up the liquid contents into the
gourd. A finger is then placed to the horn end, and he
removes his lips, raises the acojoté to his shoulder,
inserts the point of the horn, and allows the aguamiel
to run into the skin bag. The bag is fastened at its
mouth by a draw-string, which prevents the liquid from
being spilled, while the tlachiquero proceeds to further
operations.
In an old plantation you will see the maguey at
every age from the year-old that looks like a new-set
beet-plant, to the huge giant radiating over a circum-inserts the horn into the great cup of the plant, and,
ference of yards. When it is considered that a full-
grown maguey is worth at least a couple of guineas,
and that thousands of them may be seen upon a single
plantation, it may be concluded that this species of
farming is no small business. Many have realised
handsome fortunes in their culture, and many at this
moment draw ten thousand dollars a year out of their
magueys.
We come to consider the uses of the maguey. Its
principal value lies in its sap, and for this alone is it
cultivated. From this is manufactured one of the
most grateful and wholesome beverages known to the
human race →→ the celebrated drink pulqué. I need
not have said manufactured: the process is extremely
simple, but I will detail it from the beginning. You
are passing along the edge of a field of magueys a
little after sunrise; you see a singular-looking man,
with short leathern breeches, legs naked from the knees
down, and guaraches-rude leathern sandals-strapped
over his feet: a jerkin or spencer of smoky - brown
leather, corresponding to the breeches, covers his arms
and shoulders, and on his head is a broad-brimmed,
low-crowned hat of wool, glaze, or palmella. The dark
bronze of his face and legs, the inward turning of his
toes, his long and tangled black hair, convince you
that lie is an Indian. The hog-skin bag that hangs
over his left shoulder, and the long trumpet-shaped
calabash which he carries in his hand, tell you he is a
tlachiquero. His business is to extract the sap of the
maguey, and carry it home to the casa grande (large
house) of the proprietor.
He has skulked in among the huge green blades, and
you lose sight of him in a moment. Follow and observe
him. He wends his way through devious paths known
only to himself. Here he stoops down under the curv-
ing leaves; there he pushes them gently aside, holding
them so, as he squeezes past, lest their keen claws might
The acojoté is now laid aside, and our Indian takes
from his belt a small hoe-shaped instrument called the
raspa. It is simply a scraper, not unlike what is used
on shipboard, but smaller and of keener edge. With
this the tlachiquero, inserting his arm, scrapes off a
light layer from the corazon, which he throws out of
the cup. The veins through which flows the aguamiel
are thus opened afresh, and the liquid goes on collect-
ing as before. The tiachiquero now replaces the stone
(this is done to keep out dust, flies, and the sun), takes
up his acojoté, passes on to another plant, goes through
a similar series of operations, then to another, until his
skin bag is filled, when he trots off to the big house
to empty it.
He will pay three visits a day to each of the plants
that are yielding sap, but in his noon-visit he will
obtain a smaller quantity than he found in the morn-
ing, and in the evening still less. During the whole
day the plants will yield him from a gallon to a gallon
and a half each, and this yield will continue for the space
of three months. At the end of that time, the whole
of the corazon will have been scraped out, the sap will
have ceased to flow, the huge leaves will have grown
brownish and wrinkled, and the maguey will have
died. It will now be dug up, the ground levelled in,
and a young successor planted in its place.
I have said that the cultivated maguey is rarely seen
with its flower-stalk. When this happens to be the

case, the plant is considered as lost. The sap cannot
be drawn from it after it has flowered; and only on the
eve of its flowering can it be tapped so as to yield suc-
cessfully. The tlachiquero watches zealously for the
symptoms that denote the approach of this epoch, and
notes them carefully. In passing a maguey-field many
of the plants may be seen with husks of maize impaled
upon their topmost spikelets: these are the marks
of the tlachiquero. They are plants that will soon be
ready for cutting-Magueyes de Corte.
Let us now follow the tlachiquero to the house, and
see how pulqué is made.
Arrived with his bag of aguamiel, he enters an out-
house set apart for the pulqué-making business. Here
are seen numerous raw hides nailed upon frames, and
stretched so as to hollow them into the shape and
capacity of vessels, each of which might contain about
a barrel. Into one of these the tlachiquero empties his
bag, and, going off again, soon returns with another
cargo; and so on till the vessel is filled. Meanwhile
the process of fermentation has commenced, and the
aguamiel, thus jumbled about and mixed, soon loses
its crystal colour and honey-sweet taste.
It grows
whitish, and becoines more and more acidulated as the
hours pass. It is now what is termed tlachique; but
this-although to the foreign palate by far the most
agreeable drink-is not the true pulqué. The latter is
thus produced. In a vessel which stands in one corner
of the room will be found a quantity of the sap which
has been fermenting there for ten or fifteen days: this
has grown white and sour, and is called madre de
pulqué (mother of pulqué.) A small portion of this is
poured by way of leaven into the vessels that contain
the tlachique, to excite and assist the fermentation;
and in twenty-four hours after the sap has been taken
from the plant it becomes pulqué. It grows whiter
with age, and in three or four days it assumes the
appearance of thin milk.
not unfrequently may be seen, painted in large letters
on these walls, verses that celebrate the good qualities
of pulqué. Among the people it is a national drink,
and they seem to have a sort of national feeling in
regard to it. A Mexican is sure to ask the stranger
whether he likes pulqué, and an answer in the affir-
mative always seems to give gratification. Besides
making the pulqué, the maguey-plant serves many
other uses, and some of them by no means of slight
importance in that peculiar country.
We have seen that it is used in making enclosures
where timber is scarce. Houses are often thatched
with its broad, trough-shaped leaves, and this use can
be made of them after the sap has been extracted. An
excellent kind of thread, called pita, is also manufac-
tured from their fibres, and strong cloth is woven from
the same. No doubt, in the hands of a more energetic
people, the maguey could be turned to far better
account. As it is, however, they convert it to many
excellent purposes, and it is well worthy of the couplet
assigned to it :-
"
Comida, bebida,
Casa y vestida.'*
'AN HONEST PENNY.'
CONCLUDING ARTICLE.
The fresher it may be, it is the more pleasant to the
palate of the foreigner; but a genuine old Indian
pulqué-drinker likes it long kept and sour as a tart.
I myself should prefer the tlachique-that is, the agua-perhaps ought to have saved during this long period a
miel-shortly after it has commenced fermenting. I
should prefer it not only to pulqué, but to any other
drink on the face of the earth-not even champagne
being allowed to form the exception.
The pulqué slightly intoxicates- about as much as
Bavarian beer, and not so much as English ale; but the
intoxication from it is short-lived, and is never followed
by those terrible effects that are the certain sequents of
intoxication from all other drinks. Its wholesome pro-
perties as a tonic are too well known to need confirma-
tion. Every foreign resident in Mexico, although shy of
it at first, on account of what they call its disagreeable
smell I have never observed this-after awhile take
to it, like it better than the natives themselves, and
grow fat upon it.
The pulqué is to be had at all times and at all sea-
sons: Nunca falta pulqué (pulqué never fails) is one
of the sayings of Mexico. In that unchanging clime
the juice of the maguey flows at all seasons of the year
-the pulqué is fermenting at all hours, and a constant
supply is thus thrown into the market. It is usually
carried in hog-skin bags, on the backs of mules or
donkeys, and sometimes to a considerable distance;
but it is seldom to be met with in any part of the
tierras calientes, as it will not bear transportation to
these regions and remain in a fit state for drinking. It
is a perishable beverage, and can never form an article
of export.
In the large cities it is sold in shops called pulquerias,
and similar establishments are found in the villages
and along much-travelled roads in the country. The
walls of these shops are frequently ornamented with
gaudy paintings, representing parties of men and girls
enjoying themselves over the refreshing beverage; and
NANCY GOODALL was the only daughter of poor parents.
Her father was a day-labourer upon a farm at which
when a boy it was my wont to pay an annual visit at
harvest-time. She was a sprightly and active young
woman when, while yet a child, I first saw her. Born
to servitude, she graced her lot with those quiet virtues
which render servitude respectable and often endear-
ing. In her twenty-first year she accompanied the
squire's family to London in the humble capacity of
housemaid. There she remained for nearly thirty
years, rising gradually through the various grades of
service, until, finally installed as housekeeper, she had
the sole management of domestic affairs. She might,
considerable sum of money. She really saved nothing.
The sole use of money, in her estimation, was to amelio-
rate the condition of those dear to her. Her parents,
who, as they grew old and infirm, needed assistance,
received the best part of her earnings, and by her
bounty were saved from having recourse to the hateful
charity of the parish. After their death her only
brother, who had married young and imprudently,
emigrated with a large family to America.
It was
Nancy's money and Nancy's credit that procured his
outfit and paid his passage; and several years passed
after his departure before she had discharged the respon-
sibilities undertaken in behalf of him and his wife and
children. Still no thought of care or anxiety for herself
ever troubled her. She knew her old master too well
to imagine for a moment that he would ever allow her
to be in want. Since the death of her mistress she had
been the friend rather than the servant of the young
ladies, and after they were married and settled in the
north, had been the careful nurse of the old squire,
who, before he died, added a codicil to his will, which
secured her, as he thought, a comfortable provision
for life.
When the lifeless body of the old man was borne off
to the family vault in Devonshire, Nancy felt herself
completely alone in the world. She remained a few
weeks in the house in Piccadilly, awaiting the settle-
ment of affairs, and expecting the purchase of the
annuity which she well knew had been bequeathed by
her master. The cruelest misfortune overtook her at
once. Owing to certain family quarrels, and some real

or fancied neglect on the part of his heirs, which the
deceased squire had violently resented in the disposi-
tion of his property, the will he had made was disputed
on the ground of alleged insanity on the part of the
testator; and after a great deal of strife and some litiga-
tion, the estate was thrown into Chancery. Neither
of the litigants had the slightest objection to Nancy's
legacy, which each and all pronounced well deserved,
and pledged themselves to pay: but no one paid it,
and the desolate woman, now past the prime of life,
was thrown, after a comparatively easy and luxurious
existence, upon her own resources. The town-house
was shut up, and Nancy, with one quarter's wages in
her pocket, was turned loose on the desert of London
to seek for the means of subsistence. As if it were
decreed that nothing should be wanting to complete
her distress, she was knocked down and run over
by a coach while wandering about in search of a
lodging; and emerged from the hospital-to which she
was carried in a state of insensibility-three months
after, a cripple for life, to begin the world again at fifty |
years of age upon a pair of crutches.
Nine-tenths of the women in existence so situated
would have given up the contest, and retired to die in
the workhouse. Nancy was made of harder stuff. In
a dingy house in a by-street in Somerstown she took a
humble lodging, and, determined to support herself,
cast about for the means of doing it. The pride that
kept her from asking alms of any one strengthened her
resolution to do without alms. Hardly possessed of the
power of locomotion, she still managed to creep about
in search of employment. Needlework was out of
the question-her way of life not having sufficiently
skilled her in the art, and it being too late to
learn; her sight, moreover, beginning to fail. So she
boldly entered the lists of handicraft labour: paid a
journeyman clogmaker for instruction in his craft,
bought the necessary tools, and set about making clogs
for the market. In muddy London there is an immense
demand for these useful manufactures; and Nancy,
with a woman's tact for an article of woman's wear,
contrived to make her productions favourites with her
sex. It was little indeed but a few pence that she
got out of each pair; but she became expert from
practice, and therefore never wanted employment.
For seven years she pursued her laborious trade, and
supplied a large district of dealers with her stock.
She faced the rigid economy and penurious fare to
which she found herself suddenly reduced, after a life
of plentiful abundance, with a courage and patient
endurance that never flagged. Her one room was half-
filled with narrow planks of wood, from which she
sawed with her own hands the soles of the clogs, after-
wards carving them to shape, and hollowing them for
the reception of the foot. This was the labour of the
morning, generally commencing with the dawn; the
latter part of the day she spent seated at a little bench,
cutting out and affixing the leathern ears, and finishing
off the goods for the shopkeeper. She lived constantly
surrounded with chips and cuttings, and used to boast
that she smelt like a carpenter's shop. But the exer-
cise preserved and even improved her health, and the
little excitement of traffic gave a purpose and a plea-
sure to her toilsome life which she had never felt
before.
Nancy is yet alive. Contrary to almost all prece-
dent in Chancery cases, that one in which she was so
deeply interested has been lately settled. Her master's
will has been executed to the letter, and Nancy is now
in receipt of an annuity considerably greater than the
sum bequeathed for the purchase would have bought
when she was eight years younger. She has retired to
her native village-not to indulge in the pride of case
and sloth, but to set an example of usefulness and
benevolence. She has voluntarily undertaken a task
for which few are better qualified-that of educating
practically young girls for service, two of whom she
has constantly under tuition. If this short history of
her life should meet her eye, which is not improbable,
she may perhaps suspect who was the writer; but the
very last thing she would think of would be the idea of
taking offence at the narrative.
Billy Ducks (I must not give his real name for fear
of Colonel Maberley) is the lad who drives the mail-
cart from the chief town of a midland county to the
market-town of B-, situated some fourteen miles
off. Billy is the only son of a widow. While he was
yet an infant his mother, a sickly woman at best, was
driven into the workhouse by the sudden and accidental
death of her husband, a farm-labourer, who was killed
by the fall of a felled trunk of elm from a forest wain
which he was assisting to load. Billy was brought up
in the workhouse, where he was taught to read the
Testament, and to write a very little. He had inherited
an active temperament from his father, who had the
reputation of a 'harum-scarum chap;' and the habits,
manners, and likings of the boy were altogether diffe-
rent from those of his dull comrades and fellow-
prisoners. He shewed an early fondness for animals,
and for horses in particular, and soon attracted the
notice of the master and manager, who kept a nag, and
who found that it was no bad economy to intrust the
creature to the general superintendence of Billy, even
while he was yet an urchin. One consequence of this
charge was, that Billy in course of time learned to ride
-a species of accomplishment destined to be of more
use to the workhouse lad than the abstruse arts of
reading and writing. When he was about twelve years
of age his active habits and his self-acquired skill as a
groom recommended him to the notice of a neighbour-
ing farmer, who received him into his house, and gave
him shake-down and board, but never a copper of
money, in return for his services in the stable-yard
and at the plough-tail. The farmer drove regularly
every Saturday to the market at the county town, and
sometimes Billy went with him; and when the farmer,
relying on the steadiness of the boy, had sacrificed too
freely to John Barleycorn, Billy had to drive him
home; and in this way he learned to handle the whip
and reins with a dexterity which earned him quite a
reputation. Billy was happy, and would have been
contented with his lot but for one trouble which preyed
upon his mind-the other boys on the farm christened
him 'Young Workus,' and jeered him on account of his
mother, who yet remained in the house. More than
one battle he fought to avenge her outraged name; but
that did not mend the matter: the more he 'licked'
the youngsters, the more the bigger boys molested him.
His thoughts were ever on some plan to get his mother
out of the house, and a thousand times he wished
himself a man, that he might support her by his
labour.
When Billy had been two years with Farmer F—,
he heard accidentally one Saturday at the inn where
his master was in the habit of putting up every market-
day, that somebody was wanted immediately to drive
the mail-cart to B- the regular post-boy having
met with an accident, which had sent him to the
hospital with a broken head, through a collision with a
wagon in the High Street. Billy pricked up his ears,
and rushing out to find his master, sought and obtained
permission to offer his services. A trial was granted
him; and six o'clock the next morning saw him perched
on the little red mail-box, and trotting nimbly over the
pebble-stones, charged with the delivery of the mail-
bags at the town of B- fourteen miles off, at half-
past seven-trusting for guidance to the horse, which,
having travelled the same route for three years daily,
was supposed to know pretty well where he was going.
The boy's services gave entire satisfaction, and his
predecessor, obtaining promotion upon his recovery,

never returned to unseat him. Billy was officially
installed in the office, with the tremendous salary of
5s. a week, being at the rate of 10d. per twenty-eight
miles, as he goes and returns each day; throwing the
currying, foddering, and care of the horse, the cleaning
of the vehicle, and the responsibility attaching to the
charge of Her Majesty's mail-bags, into the bargain.
Verily, whatever retrenching reformers may say, some
of our public business is executed with a due regard to
economy.
But Billy never once thought of grumbling with
his pay.
To a lad who had never felt the weight
of half-a-dozen sixpences in his life, 5s. a week
appeared a mine of wealth. He marched with the
air of a lord to the workhouse, and lugged his asto-
nished mother incontinently forth; and placing her to
lodge with a cottager in the village of C-, two
and a half miles from B- returned to his duty as
proud as a general who has just won a battle. But
there is a speedy end to 5s. a week when a pair of
mouths are at work upon it; and both Billy and his
mother soon found that some addition to their income
was necessary to make both ends meet. Luckily the
exaltation of her son revived the withered hope in the
mother's heart, and she set her own wits to work to
produce an honest penny' to augment their scanty
carnings. It happens that in C- there is but one
post-delivery, and that late in the day, though it is a
large, straggling village, receiving some thirty or forty
letters a week. Mrs Ducks consulted with Billy, and
having formed their plan, canvassed the whole village;
offering the housekeepers, if they thought fit to intrust
her with them, to fetch the letters daily from the post-
town, and to deliver them by breakfast-time at C-
every morning, receiving a penny cach for the trouble
of fetching them. There were but few dissentients.
The gentry and most of the farmers were but too glad
of the opportunity of getting their correspondence in
good time. She obtained authority from nearly all
to receive and forward their letters-and thus, self-
constituted post-woman of the parish upon which she
had formerly been a burden, she has made for herself
an occupation which upon an average adds a couple of
shillings to the weekly income. Every morning at
seven o'clock, whatever the state of the weather, in
wind, hail, rain, or snow, in the cheerful sunlight of
summer or the howling storms and darkness of winter,
the widow sallies forth on her solitary route. It is for
her near an hour's walk to the post-office, where she
waits but a few minutes while the letters are sorted
which Billy has just brought. She is back again before
nine; and if she have letters to deliver-for she fre-
quently does the whole distance for nothing-they are
delivered and paid for on her arrival.
fractions when I hailed him. He said he could do
most of the sums in his head, without the chalk, as he
rode along-but he worked them over again on the stable-
door in the day; and when I asked him: How much
is three-fourths of seven-eighths of twenty shillings?'
answered in less than a minute: "Thirteen and three-
halfpence.' He said he had nearly all the day, from
eight in the morning to six at night, to himself, with
only the oss' to look after, and to call on the old
ooman' now and then; and he was trying to pick up a
little writing and arithmetic, to qualify himself for some-
thing better when it should offer. He found his berth
worth rather more than he expected. His employers
did not countenance his taking passengers, but they
took no notice of it; and he made a few shillings most
weeks by sharing his seat with a traveller, though it
was rare to meet with one of a morning.
I could see plainly enough that Billy is made of the
right metal, and is destined to get on. If circumstances
don't make him, he will make circumstances for him-
self-and this, after all, is the faculty worth most in
connection with worldly prosperity.
A COURT-POET OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY.
THE reign of Elizabeth may be considered pre-eminently
the age of chivalry. The dark days of feudalism
were past; the burdens which had long lain heavy
upon the liberties of the people, although not formally
repealed, had been gradually relaxed; the intellectual
ignorance which had formerly been the characteristic,
if not the boast of all, except the clergy, had passed
away before the humanising influence of letters. The
spirit of chivalry, however, still existed, not less poten-
tial because separated from the stern realities with
which it had formerly been associated, not less fasci-
nating because no longer connected with the remem-
brance of outrage and oppression. But the chivalry of
the age of the Tudors was not merely distinguished by
external splendour, or by the absence of the intolerable
evils inseparable from feudalism. Henry VIII., detest-
able as his memory must ever be, was no enemy to civil
liberty, and he was a genuine patron of letters. In both
these respects he was followed and excelled by Eliza-
beth. Literary merit was seldom overlooked in her
court; and among the accomplishments necessary for
the courtier who aspired to the favour of his royal
mistress the talents of the trourère were not the least
indispensable. Her court was consequently thronged
with gentlemen, who, while they rivalled the trouba-
dours-whom they proposed to themselves as their
models-in every other knightly accomplishment, far
exceeded them in poetic feeling and refinement. In
truth, Elizabeth seems to have looked for the union of
the courtly graces with intellectual superiority in all
whom she received into her favour or honoured with
her confidence. It is difficult otherwise to account for
the neglect which Spenser experienced, and for which
the disfavour of Burleigh is not a sufficient reason,
unless we charge his disappointment to the want of
those courtly graces which were at all times a sure
passport to royal favour, although more solid acquire-
ments might be needed for its preservation.
No later than the beginning of last month I had
taken it into my head to walk from the county town
whence Billy Ducks starts on his daily drive to the
little town of B―, and, rising early for the purpose,
set off almost as soon as the lark had left her nest.
When about three miles on the road, my relish for the
task had considerably abated, and seeing Billy coming
spanking along in my rear, I hailed him, and asked for
a lift. He pulled up, and thrusting a book into his
pocket, made room for me on the seat by his side. I
knew the particulars of his history perfectly well
before, and was not sorry for an opportunity of a The natural result of the favour shewn to men of
little conversation. His mode of life, as I learned it letters ensued: almost every courtier aspired to be a
from his own lips, would be no luxury to one accus-poet, and every poet strove to be a courtier. Perhaps
tomed to domestic comforts. He sleeps in the stable
with his horse; in the stable, for the most part, he eats
and drinks; and in the stable he studies, having under-
taken to educate himself in a practical way. The book
he had secreted at my appearance was a small treatise
on arithmetic, bought for twopence at a butter shop
where he got his cheese for dinner. He had worked
past the rule of three, and was botherin' out' vulgar
the former class succeeded better than their more gifted
brethren. Among oceans of rhyme, distinguished for
nothing but its servile imitation of the poems of the
troubadours, disfigured by the same extravagance of
metaphor, puerility of conceit, and ingenuity of versi-
fication, we occasionally discover traces of real poetic
feeling, for which we should in vain search in their
prototypes. Sir Walter Raleigh was undeniably the first

brought with it those gifts of honour and fortune to
which Raleigh, although a philosopher and a scholar,
was by no means indifferent. The following stanzas
indicate a quick perception of the beauties of nature.
The invectives against the court may possibly have
been dictated by some temporary disappointment, of
which Raleigh experienced his full share; but the
exquisite descriptive touches which it contains evidence
the existence of a true poetic feeling which must be
considered as a pledge of his sincerity.
Heart-tearing cares and quivering fears,
Anxious sighs, untimely tears,
Fly, fly to courts;
Fly to fond worldlings' sports,
Where strained sardonic smiles are glozing still,
And grief is forced to laugh against her will;
Where mirth's but mummery,
And sorrows only real be!
Fly from our country pastimes, fly,
Sad troop of human misery!
Conie, serene looks,
Clear as the crystal brooks,
Or the pure azur'd heaven, that smiles to see
The rich attendance of our poverty.
Peace and a secure mind,
Which all men seek, we only find!
Abused mortals, did you know
Where joy, heart's ease, and comfort grow,
You'd scorn proud towers,
And seek them in these bowers,
Where winds sometimes our woods perhaps may
shake,
But blustering care could never tempest make,
Nor murmurs e'er come nigh us,
Saving of fountains that glide by us.
Here's no fantastic masque nor dance,
But of our kids that frisk and prance,
Nor wars are seen,
Unless upon the green
Two harmless lambs are butting one the other,
Which done, both bleating run each to his mother;
And wounds are never found,
Save what the ploughshare gives the ground.

Go, let the diving negro seek
For gems hid in some forlorn creek;
We all pearls scorn,
Save what the dewy morn

Congeals upon each little spire of grass,
Which careless shepherds beat down as they pass;
And gold ne'er here appears,
Save what the yellow Ceres bears.'
Shakspeare has often been charged with plagiarism;
assuredly, in one sense, not without reason: he was
superior to the petty vanity which impels bookwrights
to strive after originality, and to prefer a startling
paradox, or a barren simile, which they can claim
without dispute as their own, to the weightiest truth
That tolls all into heaven or hell,'
bears too evident a resemblance to the famous excla-
mation of Macbeth, to be regarded as an accidental
coincidence. Again, who will not instantly recognise
in the following lines the germ of the soliloquy of
Jaques? It is headed 'De Morte,' and deserves to be
placed in juxtaposition with the more elaborate para-
phrase of Shakspeare, as a fair example of the readiness
with which the dramatist was wont to adapt to his
purpose any material that he met with and could turn
to account.
'Man's life's a tragedy: his mother's womb,
From which he enters, is the tiring-room;
This spacious earth, the theatre; and the stage,
That country which he lives in: passions rage,
Folly and vice are actors; the first cry,
The prologue to the ensuing tragedy.
The former act consisteth of dumb shows;
The second, he to more perfection grows;
The third, he is a man, and doth begin
To nurture vice, and act the deeds of sin;
I'th fourth, declines; i'th fifth, diseases clog
And trouble him; then Death 's his epilogue.'
The corresponding passage, it will be remembered, is
put in the mouth of Jaques; and it is worth consider-
ing how far the poet, while adopting the thoughts of
the courtier, may have made him further subservient to
his purpose, by embodying in the person of the caustic
moralist the character of that remarkable man, whose
personal and mental qualities must have been as well
known at the time when 'As You Like It' was written
as the extraordinary vicissitudes of fortune through
which he passed.
Perhaps the most striking peculiarity of Shakspeare
is the life-like reality, the statuesque individuality of
his characters-forcing upon us the conviction that he
was not so much indebted to the liveliness of his
imagination and fertility of his invention as to his
intimate knowledge of nature derived from the living
model. Such we know to be the fact in those histori-
cal characters whose lineaments are well known. No
writer ever took fewer liberties with history: careless
of geographical detail, heedless of occasional anachron.
ism, he never falsifies a fact or misrepresents a person.
Even if we had not contemporary authority to attest
his accuracy, who would not realise the intense reality
of his delineations of the hero of Agincourt, of Wolsey,
of Queen Katherine, or of Beaufort? They are evidently
not sketches emanating from a poet's brain, but sun-
portraits, Daguerreotyped by the genius of Shakspeare;
invested with all the graceful ornaments that poetic
imagery and diction can confer; and not only engaging
our admiration for these, but claiming our sympathy
from the irresistible conviction that they are the genuine
portraits of the very men whose names they bear.
The same remark applies to his own historical charac-
ters. The intense sympathy which these excite differing,
not in degree but in kind, from that which attaches to
the character of every other poet, can only be referred

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
to our recognition of them as intensely faithful, though
still poetic delineations of real beings. Of course this
remark applies to a comparatively small class of Shak-
speare's characters, as the majority of them are adopted
-together with the plot-from the old novels which he
dramatised. However much, therefore, they may have
been embellished and enriched in passing through his
hands, they must not be confounded with his own
creations.
Unhappily for us, literature in the time of Elizabeth
was too stately a thing to be employed as the vehicle
for gossip: Shakspeare was not blessed with a Bos-
well; no Horace Walpole had arisen to enliven his
own and instruct afterages by his piquant anecdotes
and lively sketches of society, bringing us face to face
with our great-grandfathers and grandmothers, and
giving us an assurance of their veritable existence,
which history, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
fails to convey. Had Shakspeare been as fortunate in
this respect as Dr Johnson, how much labour might
have been saved to commentators; how many an
obscure passage would have been cleared up; with
what interest might we have recognised Mercutio or
Benedict in some of the gay flutterers of the court,
under names possibly not unknown to fame; or enjoyed
the castigation inflicted on folly and presumption in
the persons of Slender and Malvolio. It is worthy of
remark, that the only characters in this play which are
not copied from Lodge's 'Rosalynd' are those of Jaques
and Touchstone. Neither is of the slightest service in
the conduct of the plot, and both bear the strong
impress of originality which invariably belongs to all
of Shakspeare's own creations. The correctness of the
portraits would doubtless soon be recognised by those
who were familiar with the originals, and must have
lent much extrinsic interest to the play in the eyes of
those with whom the real Jaques, by right of birth,
and the original Touchstone, by virtue of his profes-
sion, were entitled to associate. The character of
Jaques affords much internal evidence in support of
this theory: the haughty, cynical temper of the disap-
pointed courtier; the rebuke of the duke-for Raleigh's
life had not been blameless; the turn for philosophical
speculation; the state of Sir Walter's fortunes at
the date when the play is supposed to have been pro-
duced-about the year 1600-all agree with what we
know of his character and history. One striking
passage must not be overlooked. In act iv., scene 1,
we find the following dialogue between Jaques and
Rosalind :-
Jaques. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which
is emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical;
nor the soldier's, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer's,
which is politic; nor the lady's, which is nice; nor the
lover's, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine
own. Compounded of many simples, extracted from
many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of
my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me, is a
most humorous sadness.
Rosalind. A traveller! By my faith you have great
reason to be sad! I fear you have sold your own lands
to see other men's; though to have seen much, and have
nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Jaques. Yes, I have gained my experience!'
It is scarcely necessary to point out the applicability
of this passage to Raleigh, who, eminent as he was in
many respects, was doubtless best known as a traveller.
The allusion to his broken fortunes in the reply of
Rosalind is pointed and à propos. That such was the
result of Raleigh's experience is confirmed by his own
testimony. In his dedication of his discovery of
Guiana, published in 1596, we find the following
passage: 'I do not then know whether I should bewail
myself either for my too much travel and expense, or
condemn myself for owing less than that which can
deserve nothing. From myself I have deserved no
•
thanks, for I have returned a beggar and withered.'
These coincidences may possibly be merely accidental;
but they at least form as broad a foundation as many
upon which imposing structures of hypotheses have
been erected. It is at all events interesting even to
imagine that we can discover some traces of one of the
best specimens of our national character fossilised, as
it were, in the poetry of our great dramatist. Many
of Raleigh's poems have doubtless perished. Spenser
refers to a projected work of his which was to have
been entitled Cynthia.' It was intended to celebrate
the glories of the maiden queen, and was probably
planned upon a large scale, since Spenser alludes to it
as being in some sort a rival of the Fairy Queen.'
But the adventurous spirit which possessed him was
incompatible with the life of contemplative solitude
indispensably necessary to a great work of art. For
his larger prose works the world is indebted to the
tedium of his frequent sea-voyages and the constrained
seclusion of his latter years. The few poetic specimens
which we possess are scarcely more than ejaculatory-
the almost involuntary expressions of a mind keenly
alive to a sense of the beautiful, and clothing its
thoughts intuitively in a poetic dress, as their most
appropriate garb, with little appearance of labour or
premeditation.
Spenser has recorded the circumstances of Sir
Walter's first introduction to him in Colin Clout's
Come Home Again,' in which he pays a high tribute to
the poetic genius of the 'Shepherd of the Ocean:-
Emuling my pipe, he took in hand
"
My pipe, before that æmuled of many,
And played thereon, for well that skill he conned,
Himself as skilful in that art as any.'
It seems that Raleigh was at that time under the cloud
of regal displeasure:
His song was all a lamentable lay,
Of great unkindness, and of usage hard;
Of Cynthia, the lady of the sea,
Which from her presence faultless him debarred;
And ever and anon, with singults rife,
He cried out to make his under song:-
Ah, my love's queen, and goddess of my life!
Who shall me pity when thou dost me wrong?'
We are not informed of the reason of his disgrace;
but it could have been only of short duration, as we
soon afterwards find both him and Spenser at court
and received with due distinction; probably it is to
this temporary banishment from court that the follow-
ing stanzas refer. They are not without elegance:
their humble tone, bordering on servility, might perhaps
offend our modern ears, if we did not recollect that it
was the fashion of the day to approach Elizabeth not
merely with the homage due from the subject to the
sovereign, but also with the gallant devotion exacted
from the true knight by his lady.
'The frozen snake oppressed with heaped snow,
By struggling hard gets out her tender head,
And spies far off from where she lies below
The winter sun that from the north is fled.
But all in vain she looks upon the light,
When heat is wanting to restore her might.
What doth it help a wretch in prison pent,
Long time with biting hunger overpressed,
To see without, or smell within the scent,
Of dainty fare for others' tables dressed?
Yet snake and prisoner both behold the thing
The which but not with sight might comfort bring.
Such is my task, or worse, if worse may be-
My heart oppressed with heavy frost of care,
Debarred of that which is most dear to me,
Killed up with cold and pined with evil fare.
And yet I see the thing might yield relief,
And yet the sight doth cause my greater grief.

So Thisbe saw her lover through the wall,
And saw thereby she wanted what she saw;
And so I see, and seeing want withal,
and they having seen some wonders, and heard of others
well authenticated, deem it no longer quite impossible
that there may be others still as yet undreamt of in
even their philosophy. The ends of the earth having
been brought together, and the hitherto unknown dis-
covered and well ransacked, there is now hardly any-
thing which appears beyond our belief. We are staggered
by nothing. New Holland furnishes a goodly share
of startling animal wonders. The opossum, which was
first heard of, lifting its young in and out of a natural
pouch just as we put our handkerchief in our coat-
pocket, was hardly more strange than the quadruped
recently discovered there-a creature not unlike an
otter, with the bill of a duck (Ornithorhynchus paradoxus.)
The isles of the Indian Archipelago shewed us a fan-
And wanting so unto my death doth draw.
And so my death were twenty times my friend,
If with this verse my hated life might end.'
Raleigh's muse seems to have expired with Elizabeth.
Poetry was no longer the fashion of the court, and the
dark clouds which now rested on his fortunes, and
which were destined to be dispersed only by his death,
although they did not repress his love of historical and
philosophical research, must have had the effect of
quenching that fine fancy which once teemed with
forms of beauty. The following lines, written the
night before his execution, are the sole relique to which
we can assign a date subsequent to the death of Eliza-tastic world, whether vegetable or animal we at first
beth. This brief summing up of a long experience,
simple and devout as became the occasion, possesses a
peculiar interest from the circumstances under which
it was written:-
Even such is time, that takes on trust
Our youth, our joys, our all we have,
And pays us but with age and dust;
Who in the dark and silent grave,
When we have wandered all our ways,
Shuts up the story of our days.
But from this earth, this grave, this dust,
The Lord shall raise me up, I trust!'
could hardly tell. Here a thing like a monkey seemed
suspended in the air; there, as it appeared, a gor-
geously-spotted butterfly had alighted on a dead stick;
the forceps of a horrid beetle were stretched towards
one somewhere else: in short, you could not make out
how such various grotesque shapes could thus have got
huddled together. If you asked, you were told it was
not monkeys, moths, nor beetles you were looking at,
but plants -new sorts called Ophrys and Orchidea.
In time we get used to everything, and at last cease to
wonder. Birds-nest soup is thought no more of now
than our own turtle. That Chinese women should
lace up their feet so tightly as to change the original
shape, seems as natural to us now as that our own
women should do the same with their waists.
And yet, hand in hand with this general absence of
astonishment at whatever may happen in our own
time, will be found a vast amount of incredulity for
certain wonders of the past. There is the same incli-
nation to doubt them as there once was to doubt the
traveller's tale. It may be that vanity has somewhat
to do with this; that people do not like to hear that the
men of earlier centuries knew anything which is as
yet a secret from them. They seem to feel themselves
aggrieved by such assertions, and not being able to
deal with them, deny their truth. Yet it would appear
as if other arts besides glass or mural painting, or
the famed purple dye, did once exist, which we are
unable to imitate-to imitate at least in equal per-
fection. Though now ridiculed as fabulous, there is
still the record that glass was once made malleable.
What reason have we for doubting the story of the glass
cup that was dashed on the ground, and which bent but
did not break? That our glasses are shivered by such
experiment is no proof of the falsehood of the nar-
rative. If, but a few years ago, we had read in some
hitherto undiscovered ancient manuscript, that in the
author's time were persons who possessed the art of
arresting another's shadow, of holding it fast and keep-
Such were the last notes of the last as well as the
greatest of the bevy of courtier-poets who had embel-
lished the reign of Elizabeth. Although infected by
the characteristic affectation of the age, and trammelled
by the rules which fashion had imposed upon poetry,
it was impossible not to recognise in Raleigh the stuff
of which poets have been made. With a keen eye for
the beauty of external nature, and a strong bent for
philosophical speculation, he combined remarkable
purity of diction and considerable ingenuity in that
complex and highly-artificial versification upon which
the passion of the times set the highest value. He has
contrived even to lend interest to the eclogue. His
shepherds and shepherdesses are not knights and ladies
of high degree in masquing attire; they bear the
veritable stamp of Arcadia, and prattle with a naïveté
which is really charming. It is a matter for infinite
regret that a restless spirit, constantly goading him on
to visionary schemes of impossible execution, should
have hindered him from accomplishing some great
work which would have reflected honour upon his age,
and have entitled him to a niche side by side with
Spenser. That he was capable of a great work that
colossal fragment, the History of the World,' attests.
Had he devoted his energies to a great literary task
earlier in life, when his fancy was still buoyant, and
his mind unclouded by care, there can be little doubting it when the person himself was gone, who is there
that he would have selected a poem as the monument
of his genius. It would have been are perennius.
A LOST ART.
IT used to be the fashion for those who stayed at home
to assert that travellers lied. It never was quite clear
how they arrived at this conclusion-how they learned
the exact degree of accuracy that might be assigned to
a description of some Timbuctoo woman's housekeeping,
or discovered whether there were savages who really
ate earth, when they themselves had never been 'beyond
seas,' nor ever seen a creature more outlandish than
their own country cousins come up' from Somerset-
shire. However, assert it they did; and the veracity of
such a man as James Bruce was a question they settled
at once off-hand.
"
The fashion is now gone out; not, however, because
travellers have changed one whit in their narrations,
but because fewer people stay at home than formerly;
that would not at once have pronounced it to be un-
true? And why? Because then we had not seen the
possibility of doing it; but we should believe it now,
being able to do it ourselves. Shallow reasoning, for-
sooth; yet nevertheless it makes its way.
In a curious old book written by Abrahama Sancta
Clara,* and entitled 'Etwas für Alle' ('Something for
Every One'), is mentioned a juggling trick which,
incomprehensible as it seems to us, was, it appears,
practised in great perfection by many persons in those
days, whose performances are specified with the time
and place of their occurrence. Sancta Clara can hardly
be looked on as a person not worthy of credit. He was
court-preacher at Vienna, and was as famous for his
great love of truth as his sermons are well known for
the severe attacks they contained on the lusts and
vanities of the world. They are remarkable for their
strange language, for their occasionally jocose style, and

the terrible denunciations they launched forth against
the ungodly, whether high or low in station.
The art he describes, and which he seems to consider
as a quite separate one, was termed 'Wasserspeien
(Vomiting Water.') One person in particular-Blasio
Manfredo, a Maltese-who practised it in perfection, is
thus described:-
:-
'He would have a vessel brought full of tepid water,
and fifteen or twenty glasses, which were large at top,
and he would then rinse his mouth out to shew that he
had nothing between his teeth. When he had swallowed
some glasses full, he would spurt out a liquid like red
wine: then would follow brandy, rose-water, orange-
water, white wine, and the like, which things were all
to be known by their taste. It was observed, however,
that he always began with the red wine. Sometimes
he swallowed twenty glasses of water, and spurted it
out again like a jet d'eau. Cardinal Richelieu caused
this Manfredo, whose scholars were all the like sort of
jugglers, to be put in prison, and threatened to hang
him unless he proved his art to be natural, and not
connected with magic. This the Maltese did in great
secrecy, and was then liberated, to earn his living as
before. With this description a woodcut is given, in
which the performer is represented standing upright,
with his head thrown back, while from his mouth a high
jet of water is seen to play. There could have been
nothing displeasing in the exhibition; on the contrary,
it must seem rather pretty to view than otherwise.
Another artist is also named, Jean Roger of Lyons,
who could spout out water of twelve or fourteen diffe-
rent colours, all of a pleasant odour. He could besides
make a jet d'eau which played so long that one might
repeat the 51st psalm while it lasted. Once, in presence
of his imperial majesty Ferdinand III., he represented
a jet of fire which came from his throat.
The variety in the performances of the different per-
sons professing the art shews that it was not so very
uncommon: each one endeavoured to surpass the others
by the novelties he introduced, just as now the Wizard
of the North tries to distance his contemporaries by

present time may be seen performances quite as
marvellous as those described by the trustworthy
Benedictine monk.
ART-EDUCATION FOR ALL.
Everything which surrounds us is an influence. We are
surrounded with beautiful things in the world, and it is
our duty to make our houses look as beautiful as possible.
Everything we have in our houses, every glass and jug,
every painted door and table, is an influence, an asso-
ciation, out of which the mind receives its instruction,
even more than that which the pedagogue conveys in
school. Therefore art is nothing more nor less than the
recognition of the example set us by God. I should be
sorry to limit art to a mere canvas and statuary exposi-
tion of it. The basis of all good art-of painting and
statuary, and architecture and the ornamentation of
domestic vessels-is a constant acknowledgment of the
beauty of the external world, out of which can only come
good art. The craving for this art is perfectly universal.
The savage who carves his spear and war instruments,
and paints his body, evinces a leaning towards things
that are beautiful. The commonest hind who cultivates
his small plot of land with flowers is declaring an inward
and conscious sense of the beauty alluded to. There-
fore the manufacturer, the designer of every class, and
the workman, instead of working from the thought that
he is merely catering to a luxurious feeling, should labour
rather with the consciousness that he is labouring to cul-
tivate and raise that which in the human mind is a
natural instinct. To the designer-and house - painters
and architects are amongst this class-a true sense of art
is indispensable: that he should think for himself, and
not be continually reproducing what has been done before.
Take the ordinary house - painter: a man thoroughly
educated for his business would for 3s. 6d. make a cottage
an arena of excellence. Shop-fronts and signs, and
all these things, are influences. It is impossible to live
opposite an ill-painted shop-front without being morally

character were perfect-the best would be thrown away
upon us with ill-educated workmen. If the design be
not realised by the workman it must lose all its vitality
and beauty. We are continually talking of our infe-
riority to France and Germany in designs. In these
countries every man has received an education in art,
from the designer to the lowest class of workmen, to
enable him thoroughly to understand and to love the
work to be done. In Lyons I have seen workmen bring
into their shops quantities of flowers and draw them,
merely for their beauty, not because they were obliged to
do so. These are the men to make work beautiful and
to do justice to the designer. But even supposing the
designer and the workman to be well educated, it is no
less important that the user of a thing should be able to
appreciate it too. People in this country,' say manu-
facturers, are not in a position to tell good things from

bad ones.'
people are not prepared for beautiful things in art. That
they want education in art I readily admit, but that
they have an instinctive love for it I fully believe.-

POWER OF KITES.
The power of a kite twelve feet high, with a wind
blowing at the rate of twenty miles an hour, is as much
as a man of average strength can stand against. With
a stronger gale, such a kite has been known to break a
line capable of sustaining 200 lbs. The surface spread by
this sail is forty-nine square feet, and it should be noticed
that these serve as standing ratios, from which, by the
rule of proportion, the power of larger kites can be calcu-
lated. We must not, however, suppose that a kite of
thirty-six feet in length has only three times the power
of a kite twelve feet in length; for, in fact, it has three
times the power in length, and three times the power in
breadth, which will make the multiple nine; so that it
would lift or draw nine times as much as a kite of twelve
feet. Two kites, one fifteen feet in length, the other
twelve, have power sufficient to draw a carriage with
four or five persons when the wind is brisk.'-History of
the Charrolant.
RAILWAY TRADE.
A regular trade is now carried on between London and
the most remote parts of the kingdom in every conceivable
thing that will bear moving. Sheep have been sent from
Perth to London, and Covent Garden has supplied tons
of the finer description of vegetables to the citizens of
Glasgow; every Saturday five tons of the best fish in
season are despatched from Billingsgate to Birmingham,
and milk is conveyed in padlocked tins from and beyond
Harrow at the rate of about one penny per gallon. In
articles which are imported into both Liverpool and
London, there is a constant interchange, according to the
state of the market-thus a penny per pound difference
may bring a hundred chests of congou up or send as many
of hyson down the line. All graziers within a day of the
rail are able to compete in the London market; the pro-
bability of any extraordinary demand increases the number
of beasts arriving weekly at Camden Station from the
average of 500 to 2000, and the sheep from 2000 to 6000;
and these animals can be brought from the farthest grazing-
grounds in the kingdom without any loss of weight, and
in much better condition than the fat oxen were formerly
driven to Smithfield from the rich pastures round Ayles-
bury or the Valley of the Thames.-Sidney's Rides on
Railways.

IMPRESSIONS OF CONTINENTAL
TRAVELLING.
TRAVELLING on the continent is not, generally speaking,
so rapid as in England. The roads are not inferior to
ours, but the carriages are heavier and the horses not
in so good condition; therefore it is seldom that a
diligence or private carriage goes much more than six
miles an hour. This rate of speed suits the wishes of
continental people, who are rarely in a hurry about
anything-the idea of a business-value for time being
scarcely known amongst them. An Englishman chafes
under it; but it is to little purpose, for it is scarcely
possible to induce any driver or conductor to make haste.
The same moderation of speed has been maintained in
the railways. Sixteen miles an hour may be stated as
the ordinary rate of progress in that mode of convey-
ance. One does not find so much as twenty except in
Belgium, where business principles are more in vogue,
but they may be presumed to be in some degree
affected by English ideas.
ment.
It is not merely that movement is slow, but there are
many impediments that cause a consumption of time.
Continental people must have a great deal of accounting
about everything. The comptoir is always a most con-
spicuous and important part of a business establish-
Billets charged with minute specifications have
to be taken out beforehand for even trifling distances
by an omnibus.
You may come at the moment of
starting, find an empty place, and offer the money; but
that won't do. You must walk into a bureau, and go
through the formality of taking out a ticket. So it is
at railway-stations. The simplicity of the ordinary
transaction in England-the purchase of a ticket at the
counter perhaps three minutes before the hour of start-
ing-is totally inconceivable to our friends abroad.
You probably are sent away from your hotel an hour
before the time of starting, and you will find it well to
be as near this time beforehand as possible. On
arriving, you have to engage and fee one of the railway
porters to take your luggage to a comptoir, that it may
be weighed; for in most places every pound of it has to
be paid for, and nowhere is it wholly free. You have
to go to this place, full of coarse bustle and noise, and
wait till your turn for weighing arrives, when your
porter announces its weight, and hands you a billet
expressive of that particular, and of the appropriate
charge, together with the number put upon the
various packages as a guidance to your ultimately
claiming them at the end of your journey. You
then go to another bureau and take out your per-
sonal billet. Sometimes you are required to take out
the personal billet first, and as a necessary prelimi-
PRICE lid.
nary to getting your baggage expedited. This happens
where, as an essential preliminary to getting a billet
of either kind, you have yet another piece of business
to transact-namely, to go through an office where your
passport is inspected, or at least to shew that document
to a gendarme standing by. We lately found it so in
Prussia, in Saxony, and in the Austrian dominions.
Now, all these matters require some time; for, be it
observed, a billet is not stamped as with us. It has to
be partly written, the writing has to be dried by sand
(a thing nearly obsolete in English stationery, but in
universal use abroad), and it has also to be cut by scissors
out of a book. The slow, pedantic formality of the whole
affair is very trying to an Englishman's impatient
temper; but he cannot help himself. After all, he has to
go to the salle or waiting-room appropriate to the par-
ticular class indicated in his ticket (shewing his ticket
before he is allowed to enter), and there remain till the
proper moment when the doors will be thrown open,
and the travellers allowed to take their places in the
carriages. And this is apt to be a trying part of the
business to an Englishwoman, as in Germany she will
scarcely fail to find every man present with a cigar or
pipe in his mouth, the room full accordingly of smoke,
and the floor in a state disgustingly filthy. On the
whole, it is a most disagreeable half-hour or three-
quarters which it requires to allow a traveller to start
on a continental railway journey. When it is for
a short distance, so much time may well be much
grudged. We lately went from Verona to Mantua, in
order to look on those Mincio-laved fields where Virgil
once lived, and which one still associates with the idea
of his Melibuses and Daphnes. The railway journey
required strictly one hour, but it was made nearly three
by the omnibus journeys to and from stations, the pre-
liminary, and the consequent formalities. Our passport
was examined both in leaving Verona and in entering
Mantua. One fact in the return is sufficient to shew
the small value set upon time in that part of the world:
the omnibuses commenced their round of the hotels
in Mantua for the taking up of passengers at half-past
four, and were off on their way out of town at a quarter
to five, for a train which was to start from the station
-a mile and a half distant-at six. This was more
time than was strictly necessary; but the reason
appeared, when we found the omnibuses in time to
receive and carry back to Mantua the passengers who
came in by a train from Verona at about twenty
minutes past five!
On the other hand, it must be admitted that the
formality and deliberation with which the continental
railways are managed are attended by an apparent
safety to the passengers. Accidents are comparatively

rare on these railways. The continentalist is not in
a hurry, and he does not object to being treated with a
kind of military rigour by the officials: he appears
thus to benefit in point of security for life and limb.
The Englishman grudges to misspend a minute, and he
occasionally gets smashed. It is now indeed generally
asserted that the appalling frequency of railway acci-
dents in England is owing chiefly, if not solely, to the
insufficiency of attendance or to culpable negligence;
but we can entertain no doubt that, other things being
equal, the ratio of accidents must coincide in some
degree with the hurry of the procedure. One feels on
a continental railway that he is treated like a slave, or
perhaps it would be more correct to say that he is
treated like a parcel; but he also feels that he is all but
certain of coming safe to his journey's end.
Passports have been touched upon. It is a terrible
business to the English continental traveller, forming
a subject of anxiety and trouble, and a cause of expense
at every place he comes to. He never can be safe for
a moment without it; and yet it must occasionally be
parted with in order to be examined by the police.
Returning to Berlin from a forenoon's visit to Potsdam,
we lately found a cordon of soldiers drawn up across
the platform, and all the passengers had to shew their
passports before being allowed to leave the station.
Our own passport being at this time in the hands of
the police, we should probably have been in some diffi-
culty here had it not been for our commissionaire, who
contrived to make his own certificate pass for us also.
What would our London holiday-makers think if they
could not visit Windsor without a similar detention on
their return to the Paddington station? The strict-
ness is at present greatest in the Austrian dominions.
At Vienna we wished to go to Presburg to visit an
English friend who lives there. It is a two hours'
journey; but it cost us a considerable part of the
previous day to make two attendances at the police-
office, in order to give the explanations necessary before
obtaining permission to go. Being subsequently too
late in our application at the police-office for our
passport vise for Trieste, we had to wait an extra day
in Vienna in order to obtain the document. By a
similar oversight, the consequence of misunderstanding
an official, we had to wait a day in Trieste before
getting permission to go to Venice. Thus we lost two
days out of five through this troublesome formality—a |
considerable loss in money to a party of three persons,
but a greater loss in tedium and ill-humour. Such
things are great drawbacks from the pleasures of a
continental journey. In the Austrian railways one or
two officers wearing their swords come in at the second-
last station, and before the final stoppage of the train
go through the carriages from end to end, examining
the passports of the passengers. The poor passengers
always appeared to us to have a sadly cowed look
while under this process. It was a particularly painful
spectacle in Hungary and Lombardy, where every-
body knows that the people are kept down purely by
military force. We may here remark that the
Austrian railways are altogether in the hands of the
government, which contemplates a primary utility for
them as means of transporting troops through its
disaffected provinces. The filling up of a space, where a
mountainous tract has to be crossed, is a stupendous
piece of railway engineering. In passing along in the
omnibuses, which at present form a provisional mode
of transport, one sees the sections and bridgings for the
line going on at an aërial height on the rough, woody
mountain-side, and reflects how powerful must be
the motive which compels a government notoriously
embarrassed to push on so expensive a work. Mean-
while the unrailed intervals of the space are all
furnished with electric lines for the communication of
intelligence. It is curious to see the poles stretching
across a moorland tract where there is no railway, and
sometimes, for the sake of short cuts, not very near
to the post-road.
There is one comfort pretty general on the continent
for which the traveller feels himself in a great measure
indebted to the rigid system of administrative discipline
by which so many matters are conducted: we allude
to the street carriages, which are almost everywhere
under such regulations that attempts to overcharge
are nearly prevented. The one arrangement above all
others conducive to this good end is, making the charge
depend on time. Obviously, while there may be
great doubt about the distance which a street carriage
has travelled, there need be none about the time
occupied in the course. We accordingly found in the
cities where this plan prevails, that we could settle
with the drivers of street carriages in an amicable spirit
and without an approach to dispute, thus avoiding that
worry to which every stranger in our English cities is
subjected in dealing with that class of men. We would
instance Berlin and Baden-Baden as places where the
time-system, with some little fortification from other
regulations, works particularly well. Is it beyond
hope that a system founded on the best continental
experience could be introduced in England? We
hardly know any department of public service in which
there is more need for reform than this. In Berlin the
charge for one or two persons by a one-horse carriage
is sixpence for a quarter of an hour, and one-and-six-
pence for an hour. An additional person pays a half
more.
The physical distinction between the continent and
England which most strikes a traveller is with respect
to the atmosphere. A native of our cloudy island feels
exhilarated by the pure, dry, blue air which envelops
him abroad. There is a lustrous brightness over even
city objects which one never sees at home. We feel
the air to be a fine medium in which we are bathing-
a novel and most pleasing sensation. It is distressing
in central Europe to observe the extent to which, in
towns, the natives persist in drugging their beautiful
atmosphere with tobacco-smoke. The German seems
as if he would never willingly part with his pipe or
cigar. He indulges his propensity without delicacy
towards women or strangers-at all hours and seasons:
we have seen him keep the pipe in his mouth in situa-
tions of difficulty, or while engaged in work, when an
Englishman would have deemed it necessary to be free
of all encumbrances whatever. While conversing with
him you feel his breath like the air from an old disused
chimney, as if his windpipe were cased with ancient
soot all the way down. Throughout Austria you can
enter no public carriage where you are safe from the
persecution of tobacco smoke, nor can you anywhere
secure an exemption from it in favour of any ladies in
your charge. Political feeling has lately effected in
Lombardy a reform which probably refinement could
never have accomplished-the people having generally
abandoned the use of tobacco out of hatred for the
government, which derives a revenue from the article.
Would that some similar gust of sentiment would
banish the nuisance from other dominions of the House
of Hapsburg! One quickly perceives how smoking
accords with the deliberate habits of the German.
Being never in a hurry, he has time to smoke; and
being devoted to smoking, he can do nothing expedi-
tiously. It is a prominent feature of continental life
all through the season of travel, that multitudes of
well-dressed men are continually seen sitting in the
open air in front of the establishments called cafés.
They generally content themselves with some very
innocent liquor-coffee or eau sucré; and thus pro-
vided, with a newspaper, and a few neighbours to
converse with, they will sit for hours, as if they
had no business to call them elsewhere.
We at one
time felt pleased with the sight of so many people
making themselves happy with such simple things;

but we have latterly begun to think the custom not
very creditable.
To be contented with an amuse-
ment so puerile, so insipid, and so slow, marks, we
should say, some default in the popular mind. The
men who spend much of their time in this way must
to some extent neglect their affairs. They can have
little time besides for improving their minds by study.
They cannot be a progressive people. There is a
vicious circle in politics. If a people has no share in
ruling, its mental calibre becomes or remains contracted;
and while its mental calibre is contracted, it cannot be
fit for any share in the government. To this total
inaptitude and inexperience in which the continental
nations have hitherto been kept by their governments-
as if it were necessary to treat men in all situations
and throughout all time as children-must mainly be
attributed the sad failure of the democratic movement
all over Europe in 1848-49, by which, to all appearance,
improvement has been put back for a generation. But
this is rather a serious corollary to draw from a few
remarks on the custom of dawdling over eau sucré;
and as our rôle is not politics, it would perhaps be best
to say no more on the subject.
One general remark that arises in our minds from a
pretty long continental excursion is, that though there
is much to be pleased with in what one eats and drinks
and hears and sees and feels when abroad, there is yet
a felicity in the condition of England which may well
make an Englishman content with his own country.
We have a kindly regard for all neighbouring countries
and people, and are no bigots on any point; but
commend us after all to the tight little island!
RAMBLES IN SEARCH OF WILD-FLOWERS.
OCTOBER.
I MUST now beg to introduce those who have been so
far companions in my rambles to some friends who had
at this time joined me in my solitude, and who will
accompany us in a walk to the bogs where I formerly
found the Equisetum sylvaticum. These were a beloved
brother, who had come to pass a day or two with me,
and his intelligent and merry little son, of about eleven
years old, who had accompanied him; and as if to make
all things around me seem bright and joyous, my own
dear invalid charge had sufficiently recovered to be
able, under certain restrictions, to share our pleasure,
and to go at least part of the way with us. The special
object of this ramble was to shew to the new-comers
the beautiful sight of the flowering fern (Osmunda
regalis), now just in perfection.
It was a glowing day-one of those very hot morn-
ings which sometimes burst forth to gild the autumn;
yet, as we ascended the hill and crossed the heath, the
never-failing sea-breeze relieved the ardent heat, so as
to enable us much to enjoy our walk, as we lingered on
our way—lionising the ground as we went-now pointing
out to our interested friends the different beauties of
the scenery, and the exquisite views of the deep-blue
sea, which from time to time opened on us; and then
diversifying the scene by eating some blackberries,
or searching out relics of such rare plants as still
remained, spreading their almost faded beauties among
the decaying leaves-in like manner as we sometimes
see a few of those gems of person or mind which have
adorned youth outliving the wear and tear of the world,
and embellishing the latter years of the life of their pos-
But as the relics of summer flowers are chiefly
found in sheltered and calm nooks, where neither sun
nor wind has had full power, so are those lingering
ornaments of body or mind most frequently found in
sessor.
those whose lot has been cast in the more sequestered
paths of life-where nature has not been stifled by art,
and the free course of her blossoming neither forced by
the glare of worldly adulation and prosperity, nor
checked by the biting blasts of undue discouragement.
Chatting, botanising, and berry-eating, we pursued
our way, a happy group, once more down the sloping
field, where the cotton-grass still displayed its snowy
tassels of fibre, and the cross-leaved and purple heaths,
and the silvery spikes of the pale-lilac ling, still decked
the ground; and now I had the pleasure of finding the
pretty white beak-rush (Rhynchospora alba), which
grew in profusion all over the face of this bog, though
wholly unknown in either of the others in the neigh-
bourhood. The white beak-rush is not a true rush,
and belongs not to the N. O. Juncea, in which real
rushes are placed, but to the Cyperaceae, and has but
half the number of stamens and pistils which are to be
found in a juncus. It is an elegant little thing. The
spikelets of white flowers are collected so as to form a
level surface at the summit, and spring from a large
floral leaf which overtops the head of flowers; the
leaves are tapering and linear, extremely elegant and
delicate in their growth, rising erect with a graceful
curve, and being very slight and sharp-pointed. The
whole plant is almost white; and the root, which
generally comes out of the soft, boggy ground at the
least pull, is a pretty tube with delicate fibres hanging
from it, and looking almost like a small bulb. The
bog now displays a great variety of different kinds of
carex, rush, and plantains, but it is very wet; and we
find that the fatigue of crossing it, and proceeding to
the marsh in search of the Osmunda, would be too much
for the strength of my feeble young charge. We were
loath to leave him, but his cheerful good-humour made
all easy; so, settling him on a pleasant bank under the
copious shade of a lofty oak, and providing him with a
store of rushes to plait, we left him with his little
and amuse him with his chat, and pushed briskly on
friend to supply him with fresh materials for his work,
to the enclosure, which we found now fairly overgrown
with the beautiful little arborescent sterile spikes of
the Equisetum sylvaticum, and turning to the right, we
soon stood directly in front of the object of our pursuit.
But before entering on the description of any one
individual of that tribe, so full of interest, so curiously
and beautifully diversified in form and structure, though
forming such a united and well-defined family—I mean
the fern tribe--it may be as well to examine a little in
detail what are the most marked characteristics by
which we may readily know a fern from any other
plant; and in so doing we shall be led to observe how
wonderful and varied are the works of God, and to
remark fresh instances of that love which provides for
his creatures so many sources of interest and enjoy-
ment, and so many wonderful and beautiful objects
for their admiring study. The most clear and simple
definition of a fern that I have seen is that given in
Macgillivray's condensation of Withering's arrangement
of British plants-a little work so easy to understand,
so portable, and so cheap, that I would strongly recom-
mend it to any one who wishes easily to make out the
names of any flowers or plants he may meet with-it
is this: A plant consisting of a frond (leaf) with
dorsal or terminal fructification.' Whenever you meet
with a leaf bearing on its under side roughish dark-
coloured spots, which you find on investigation contain
seeds, you may be sure-whether it is small or large,
or whatever may be its shape that it is a fern of some
kind or other. But there are some plants which, though
classed by most botanists as ferns, and belonging to
the N. O. Filices, are yet not true ferns, nor quite so

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL!
easily discerned to be of that order. Of these the
Osmunda, which bears its fruit on a terminal spike,
instead of at the back of the leaf, is one; a second is
the moonwort (Botrychium lunaria), a pretty little plant,
from about three to six inches in height, the rachis or
stem of which is divided into two parts-a pinnate leafy
portion, and a spike of fructification. This grows in
many parts of England, and is found also, though more
sparingly, in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Magical
properties were formerly attributed to it. A third
kind is the adder's tongue (Ophioglossum vulgare), also
more abundant in England than in the other divisions
of Great Britain: this consists of a single, undivided,
and sharp-pointed frond, rising so as to form a shield for
a spike of fruit which springs from the same hollow rachis
or stem. After this spike begins to mature, it grows
so as to overtop the leaf, which, when young, formed
its shelter; and when perfect, stands as much above
the frond as below it, displaying a double row of theca
or capsules, which, when the seed is ripe, open trans-
versely, gape widely, and allow the seed to be scattered
by the winds. When this plant gets abundant it is
considered a serious injury to the crop of grass, as it
often covers acres of ground. These three are the only
British plants which, though called ferns, do not bear
their fruit on some part of the back of the leaf.
Ferns differ widely in their size, form, and the
situation where they grow. There are some of which
the fronds are three or more feet in length, elegantly
cut and divided-as the brachen (Pteris aquilina), the
shield ferns, &c. There are others where the leaf
is straight at the edge, and uncut, from three or
four inches to a foot or more in length: of these is
the elegant glossy hart's tongue (Scolopendrium vulgare),
so abundant around fountains and spring-heads, as
well as drooping in huge clusters on the hedges in
shady places, of which Dioscorides tells us that, 'being
drunke in wine, it is a remedie against the bitings
of serpentes.' Then there is the polypody, formed
of leaves cut in even to the very midrib with alter-
nate divisions, the back of its leaf ornamented by a
double row of yellow, bead-like thecæ, and growing
in beautiful tufts in all directions. From the top of
old walls, out of the fissures of aged oaks, or on the
surface of the weather-beaten rock, there the year
through may be found the graceful polypody in droop-
ing clusters; for the fronds thrown up in May and June
are matured by September, and retain their vigour
and beauty until those of the succeeding year make
their appearance. But to give an idea of half the
varieties of ferns which exist even in these islands
would be impossible in the limited space which I can
allot to that purpose: it must therefore suffice to say,
that though there are some species so large as I have
before stated, there are others most diminutive; that
whilst some sorts may be found on the crests of the
loftiest mountains, there are others which luxuriate
alone in the sheltered woods and lanes which intersect
the land; some, such as many of the spleenworts (Asple-
niums), abounding on old walls, ruins, and churches,
where, mixed with the scaly-leaved hart's tongue
(Ceterach officinarum)—so rare in the midland and
northern counties, though so very plentiful in the
south-western-they start from beds of the driest
mortar, and enamel the stonework with their brilliant
verdure; whilst others no less lovely will flourish only
where the spray of the waterfall ceaselessly drops on
them, keeping them continually in a dripping state.
There is scarcely a locality where ferns of some kind
are not found, and there is no season of the year when
you may not gather them in all their brightness. From
the frozen regions of the north to the flowery plains of
the south, in the frigid and in the torrid zones, these
beautiful plants are indigenous, and many of them
have valuable medical properties. The leaves contain
in many instances a thick astringent mucilage, with
other matter, on which account many are considered
pectoral and lenitive. Capillaire is so called from being
prepared from the Adiantum capillus veneris, a plant of
pectoral and astringent qualities; and Osmunda regalis
has been employed successfully for the rickets. The
common bracken (Pteris aquilina) and the male shield-
fern (Aspidium filix mas) have even been used in the
manufacture of beer-at least so Lindley states, and we
cannot have better authority-as Aspidium fragrans
has been as a substitute for tea. The people of Tas-
mania roast and eat the root of one species of fern
for bread with the flesh of the kangaroo.
But I must not allow myself to dwell longer on the
subject of ferns in general; but having given a few of
the leading characteristics of the tribe, we must now
return to the little enclosure where the Osmunda regalis
awaits us. The generic name of this family, Osmundu,
is said to be of northern origin, and to be so named on
account of its potency in medicine. Osmunder was one
of the names of Thor, a Celtic divinity; and mund in
Anglo-Saxon is expressive of force or power. It is the
finest of all our species of British ferns, and indeed
there was no need of minute investigation in seeking
for it: high-arching over our heads rose the proud
fronds of this 'flower-crowned prince of English ferns.'
The whole hedge was a mass of fronds-some in full
fruit, others robed only in the fairy green, which decks
the sterile branches, absolutely glittering with beauty,
and rising from the foot to the crown of the hedge in
massive luxuriance; the upper ones, standing high
above our heads, being in themselves both sterile and
fertile fronds, from six to eight feet in length, and
raised on a bank some feet high, which they amply
clothed; indeed they so intersected the whole hedge
for some yards of its length as to appear to form its
main substance.
If you, my reader, have ever felt that sort of
enthusiastic feeling which leads you to a sort of per-
sonal appropriation of the scenery or objects of
nature or art which happen to be near your dwelling,
making it all scem as if it were really your own, and
you yourself were answerable for its making a good
appearance, and justifying your description of its
beauties, you will perhaps be able to enter into the
proud feeling of exultant success which possessed me
when standing before this splendid group of foliage I
saw at a glance that it more than answered the expec-
tation I had raised in the mind of my companion, and
observed the pleasure with which he selected two or
three of the giant fronds, traced the stems to the point
where they sprung from the rhizoma-the part between
the stem, or rachis, and the root-and cut them. One
measured more than seven feet, and the spike of fruit
was, I should say, not less than twelve or fourteen'
inches in length, the rest falling little short of like
dimensions. The Osmunda regalis differs from the usual
habit of others of its order in its mode of fructification,
which approaches more nearly to that of the Equisetacea,
its thecæ or seed-vessels being gathered into a terminal
spike, or rather cluster of spikes, instead of being, as I
have said is usual with most ferns, disposed on the
under side of the leaflets. The frond of the Osmunda
is linear and pinnate, there being four or five pair of
pinne or leaflets, exquisitely veined, and of a clear,
semi-transparent green of a remarkably vivid tint.
The apex or point of the fertile frond is composed
of its spikes of fruit, whilst that of the sterile bears
green leaflets to the summit. It is not unusual to
find some of the pinnæ towards the base of the
spike only partially converted into thecæ, and pre-
senting an edge of green to view. This arises from the
theca being borne on the margin of contracted leaves.
Old Gerarde, in his Herbarium, calls it 'Osmund the
waterman.' Why, I know not, for I have not been able
to trace the reason, though I do not doubt that there
must have been some legend connected with the plant

which led to the name. He says of it: The root is
great and thicke, folded, and covered over with many
scales and interlacing roots, having in the middle of
the great and hard woody part thereof some small
whiteness, which has been called the heart of Osmund
the waterman, The root, and especially the heart or
middle part thereof, boyled or else stamped, and taken
with some kinde of liquor, is thought to be good for
those that are wounded, dry-beaten, or bruised-that
have fallen from some high place; and for the same
cause the empiricks doe put it in decoctions, which the
later physitians doe call wound-drinkes. Some take it
to be so effectual and of so greate a vertue that it can
dissolve cluttered blood remaining in any inwarde part
of the body, and that it alsoe can expell or drive it out
by the wound.
It is exceedingly difficult to get this great and
thicke root' out from the bog in which it grows. A
collector gave me an amusing account of the manner
in which he had long in vain assailed it, as, in con-
sequence of there being no resistance in the soil, his
spade failed to act on the root, and gave way under the
pressure-a result likely to overthrow him in the mire.
He, however, succeeded at last in securing a piece by
getting the spade fairly under the root, and so lifting
it out, conveyed it safe to his fernery, where, with some
two dozen other species, collected from various parts of
England, it was happily flourishing and bearing its
fruit a year after its removal. This fern, though usually
erect in its growth, sometimes, when it grows near the
water's edge, assumes a pendent character. Newman
says: "I noticed a beautiful instance of this when at
Killarney, where it completely fringes the river between
the lakes, and certainly forms a most prominent feature
in that lovely but neglected portion of Killarney's far-
famed scenery.
So altered is the usual character of
this fern, that its long fronds arch gracefully over, and
dip their masses of seed in the crystal water; whilst
the saucy coots, from beneath the canopy it affords them,
gaze fearlessly on the visitors who are continually
passing by. The whole aspect of the plant is most
noble and majestic. Hooker records that Mr Stewart
Murray measured a tuft of its fronds on the banks of
the Clyde, which, from the base to the apex, measured
eleven feet and a half in height. Impressions of the
leaves of Osmunda are, according to Withering, fre-
quent in the nodules of ironstone found in Coalbrook-
dale, Salop. He says it is the only species of an
indigenous vegetable which he has ever discovered in
a fossil state; adding, that all the other impressions
of filices which he has found on ironstone seem to be
those of American plants; but remarking, however,
that Osmunda is also a native of Virginia. He tells
us a curious fact-namely, that this plant, though
before not to be found for many miles around Bir-
mingham, in the year 1802 appeared on an archery
butt on Moselay Common, artificially raised with mud
from a deep pit, in which the seeds had probably lain
for a length of time. It continued to flourish so long
as the butt remained.'
The singular phenomena which exist connected with
the vegetative power in seeds require but observation
to strike every mind with wonder and admiration.
'Some,' says Withering, 'lose their vital principle by
being kept out of the ground even for a short time after
ripening; whilst others may be sent round the world,
and exposed to every vicissitude of climate, or even be
buried for ages in the earth, and yet vegetate with the
first favourable opportunity. Some will spring up on
any soil or in any aspect; whilst others wait, lying
dormant till some soil or rooting-place to which they
have affinity is presented to them, when they at once
put forth their energies, and become vigorous plants.
Wheat, taken from the wrappings of mummies 3000
years old, has been known to vegetate freely. New
cuttings for railroads or other purposes, to be speedily
covered with plants of species before unknown in their
neighbourhood, as in the cuttings at Box, near Bath,
plants of the brittle fern (Cystopteris fragilis) were
found, as if sprung from seeds which had lain dormant
perhaps for ages-that fern not being, as I have been
told, before known in that locality. The Osmunda
seems to be widely distributed over the kingdom, yet it
is not generally well known. Probably the fact of its
growing only in bog-earth may account for this, as few
people are in the habit of visiting wet bogs; yet it
is well worth while to do so, if only for the sake of
becoming acquainted with this noble plant. It is said
that Sir Walter Scott, when visiting Killarney, seemed
unmoved and unadmiring until coming to a part of the
scenery where this fern abounds and takes a drooping
character, gracefully arching in large tufts over the
water, and forming a shelter for many aquatic birds,
he stopped the boatmen, and exclaimed- This is
worth coming to see!' The fronds when they first
appear are of a salmon hue, and, until matured, con-
tinue somewhat of a reddish colour. They are of very
rapid growth, and each root bears from six to twelve
fronds, two or three of which would form an ample
shade from the sun for a tall man; and, indeed, we
ourselves found those we had gathered most useful for
that purpose as we walked homewards.
We now, having secured our main object, began to think
of returning to those whom we had left on the other side
the bog; but as we retraced our steps, we found other
objects of interest. On the turfy banks of the hedges,
rising from the sloping sides of ditches, on the ramparts
of earth which separated the enclosures-all round us,
feathering the ground with its elegant foliage of the
most vivid green, we found that pretty and graceful
fern, which, though generally distributed throughout
our land, is much less frequent in the southern than
in the northern counties, as indeed its name would
indicate: as it is called the northern hard fern (Lomaria
spicant.) Every fern has a root-a rhizoma-which is
the part between the root and the stem, and which
corresponds to the trunk in a tree, and is in fact that
which in the tree-ferns of tropical countries forms the
trunk and a stem or rachis from which the leaflets
spring. Now the roots in the hard fern are black,
tough, and wiry; the rhizoma is tufted-that is, above
ground-and hairy; the rachis of the fertile frond dark
purple, smooth, and shining; whilst that of the sterile
is green; the fertile frond is linear and pinnatified-
that is, once cut, and pointed at the apex. It grows very
erect, and is often a foot and a half or more in length,
the back being thickly loaded with capsules, lying so
close together that none of the substance of the leaf is
to be seen. The barren frond is not so erect, wider
and shorter, of a brighter green, and wholly without
capsules. The appearance of this and some other ferns
would puzzle those who are not aware that some plants
of that order produce both barren and fertile fronds
from the same root and at the same time. The beautiful
parsley-leaved fern (Allosorus crispus), which so richly
decorates those masses of stone which hang about the
mountains in the Lake and other northern districts, and
may be found springing from the crevices in old stone-
walls, is one in which the fertile and barren spikes are
found at the same time and on the same root; and the
beautiful maiden-hair (Adiantum capillus veneris), so
rare in England, is another. This most elegant species
is to be found at Ilfracombe, in Devonshire, and in two
or three spots in Cornwall. I have also heard of plants
being found near Brixham, in South Devon; but the
inconsiderateness of collectors has been such, that
where it used to grow abundantly it is now difficult to
find specimens. In the South Isles of Arran it, how-
ever, abounds to such an extent that it is said the
inhabitants gather it and use it as tea.
And so, after a lengthened ramble, combining much
enjoyment with the attainment of some information

day's amusement. Now Charley is a machine-man in
the Printing-office, and having put the Sunday
paper to bed at about two o'clock, instead of going
home to his own after a week of unremitting toil, he
had set off for Hornsey by moonlight, where, perching
himself upon a bank, he had sat from three in the
morning till seven at night, bobbing for small fry at a
bend in the New River. His basket was well stuffed-
with grass; among which he pointed exultingly to four
or five little silvery victims, whose united weight would
have kicked the beam against a quarter of a pound.
And yet Charley thought himself successful; and so
he was in comparison with the average of New-River
anglers.
WILD SPORTS OF THE EAST.
THE angling season begins in London with the very
first disappearance of frost and the first blush of blue
sky in the heavens; and, with comparatively few excep-
tions, Sundays and holidays are the only days of sport.
The young angler begins his career in the Surrey Canal,
the Grand Junction Canal, or the New River, which-
ever happens to be nearest to the place of his abode. But we must ascend in the scale in order to do fair
His first apparatus is a willow-wand, bought at the justice to our subject, and take a glance at the angling
basketmaker's for a penny, and a roach-line for five- establishments in the neighbourhood of London, where

beguile his prey with a vegetable diet. In order that shall sketch one where we have before now passed a

gravel, which he industriously scatters upon his float
as it sails down the stream, doubtless impressed with
the notion that the whole finny tribe within hearing
will swarm beneath the stony shower to take their
choice of the descending blessings, and finding his bait
among them, give it the preference, and swallow it as a
matter of course. The theory seems a very plausible
one; but we cannot say that in practice, though wit-
nessing it a thousand times, we ever saw it succeed.
For the sake of something like an estimate of the
amount of success among the juvenile anglers of this
class, we lately watched the operations of a group
of nearly thirty of them for two hours, but failed in
deriving any data for a calculation, as not a fin appeared
above water the whole time. With the exception of a
few stunnin' bites,' and one 'rippin' wallopper,' which
was proclaimed to have carried off a boy's hook, there
was no indication of sport beyond that afforded by the
party themselves.
When the sun, bountiful to sportsmen, begins, as
Shakspeare has it, 'to breed maggots in a dead dog,' a
new and superior race of anglers appears upon the mar-
gin of the waters. The dead dogs then have their day,
and are now carefully collected from holes and corners
by the makers and venders of fishing-tackle, and com-
fortably swaddled in bran, where they lie till their
bones are white, originating 'gentles' through the live-
long summer for the use of the devotees of angling.
Now we see something like tackle deserving the
name: capitalists who think nothing of a crown, ay,
or a pound either, by way of outfit; rods of real
bamboo, straight as an arrow, and fifteen or twenty
feet long; floats of porcupine quill, and lines of China
twist; bait-boxes, fish-cans, and belted baskets, and
all the paraphernalia of the contemplative recreation
appear upon the banks; but still no fish, or nothing
larger than what a half-pound trout would gobble up
in his prowlings through some country stream for
breakfast. All these mighty preparations are made
against a generation among which a full-sized sprat
would rank as a triton among the minnows. Not one
Cockney sportsman in ten thousand has ever seen a
trout alive, and would perhaps be as likely to be pulled
into the water by one of a couple of pounds' weight
as to pull the fish out were he by any miracle doomed
to the terrible alternative.
The oriental's enthusiasm for the sport has no sort
of relation to his success. We met Charley Braggs in
our last Sunday - evening's walk returning from his
-
We mount upon an omnibus, and driving four or
five miles through the suburbs in a north-easterly
direction, are set down at a turnpike-gate in a neat,
tree sprinkled village. Leaving the village to the
west, we take the turnpike-road, which leads in a
direct line to the river, where, at the distance of half
a mile from the village, it is crossed by a substantial
and handsome bridge. Traversing the bridge, we
turn to the right after a passage of a few score paces,
and enter, through neatly-trimmed walks, upon the
grounds and gardens of a country inn. Covered seats
and rustic alcoves-arbours, and quiet, snug, leafy
retreats, abound in the gardens and grounds which
abut upon the river's brink. The water foams and
dashes with the unceasing noise of a cataract over a
series of wooden dams, erected to divert the main
current into a new channel for the purposes of naviga-
tion-the old bed of the river being that rented by the
proprietor of the inn, and by him strictly preserved for
the delectation of his patrons, the amateur anglers of
the metropolis. Let us enter the house, and proceeding
up stairs to the piscatory sanctum, look around us
while we impinge upon a bottle of the landlord's unex-
ceptionable ale. Here we are in the very paradise of
the London anglers, and surrounded with the trophies
of their cunning and patience, ranged in glass-cases, and
labelled with the weight of the immortalised victims
and the names of their fortunate captors. Here it is
recorded, for the instruction of future generations, that
a gudgeon of seven inches three-eighths in length, and
five ounces ten drachms in weight, was captured by the
redoubtable Dubbs of Tooley Street, on the 6th of
August 1839; and though Dubbs himself, for aught we
know, may long since have been gathered to his fathers,
the wide-mouthed witness of the fact, the gudgeon
himself, still hangs in the centre of his glass-case,
suspended like Mohammed's coffin between heaven and
earth, to bear perpetual testimony to his prowess.
Yonder is a perch of three pounds caught by Stubbs of
Little Britain; and above it a marvellously chubby
chub, caught by Bubb of the street called Grub. These
memorials of past achievements no doubt have their
due influence, and urge the rising heroes of the angle
to emulate their great forerunners. One whole side of
the dining-room you see is parcelled out in lockers
large enough to contain the necessary tackle and
apparatus; and each locker is neatly painted, and bears
the name of the amateur to whom the contents belong.

subscribing members of the angling fraternity; and
here on every Sunday throughout the summer, unless
the weather be very bad indeed, they muster strong,
often arriving while the dew is yet on the grass, and
pursue their silent pleasures till dinner, steaming on
the table at two o'clock, calls them together to report
progress and recruit their strength.
The conversation on these occasions is characteristic
and technical, and altogether fishy.
'Ha, Bubbs!' says Stubbs; shake a fin, old trout.
What's the cheese? You don't look very fresh about
the gills to-day.'
'Why,' responds Bubbs, 'you see I started afore
light, and had but a scaly breakfast-not quite the
thing in the ground-bait, you see. I'll be all right
as a roach after I've nibbled a bit, I daresay.' Happy
the man who at the dinner-table can display to the
view of his admiring comrades some fish of mark-
some roach of ten, or chub of twenty ounces. Old
exploits are gone over for the hundredth time, with
added particulars at every repetition. Baits are over-
hauled and discussed along with the brandy and water.
Moss-crammed bags, where blood-worms, dung-worms,
lobs, and lance-tails are kept to scour, are ransacked for
specimens, and notes and maggots are compared, and
much finny and vermic lore is elicited from the veterans
of the silent art. The dinner and grog being duly ho-
noured, the rod is again resumed beneath the shadowy
shelter of the trees on the river's brink; and long after
the gloom of night has descended upon the gurgling
stream the brethren of the angle in populous silence
pursue their labours. It is now seven years since friend
Bubb caught his big chub: the monster fish rose at his
fly full sixty feet off, on the opposite side of the stream,
where there is an eddy of the current rebounding from
yon projecting piles. It was the work of an hour-the
hour of Bubbs's life-to bring the 'wallopping gentle-
man' safe to land; and ever since, throughout every
Sunday and holiday of the fishing season, has Bubbs
been lashing away at the water with his whipping-rod
and fifty yards of line, in the fond expectation of
catching another to match him. 'Good-luck to your
fishing!' say we. We cannot wait for the next bite,
but must be off to see what the punters are about in
the Thames.
'Patience in a Punt' is the title of an old caricature,
representing the elderly gentleman' of hat-and-wig
notoriety seated on a dilapidated chair in a flat-
bottomed boat during the pelting of a pitiless storm,
from which he is but partially sheltered by the skeleton
of an umbrella, and, with eyes intent on his float, wait-
ing for a bite. The picture is as applicable at the
present hour to the class for whom it was intended
as it was when published forty years ago. The
punt is a nondescript kind of boat, with perpendicular
sides and square ends. The fishing-houses on the
banks of the Thames-of which there are plenty on
both sides of the river, from Putney to Kingston, and
beyond-are abundantly provided with these boats, in
which the angler sits upon a chair, and generally baits
for barbel, the only fish in the waters near London,
with the exception of the pike, which, from the unwil-
lingness he manifests to leave his native element,
can be said to yield anything like sport in the catch-
ing. In some parts of the river near Twickenham they
are exceedingly plentiful at times, and thirty or forty
pounds' weight of them are not unfrequently caught in
a day by a single rod. There is one thing against
them, however, and that is, that they are worse than
good for nothing. They hardly deserve the name of
fish, being a species of mud vermin armed with snouts,
and they taste of earth to a degree perfectly nauseous.
People every season die through eating them, yet they
are eagerly sought after, and an immense amount of
time and expense is annually thrown away in their
capture. The virtue of patience in connection with
punt-fishing is exemplified in waiting day after day
half the season through before you make acquaintance
with a single barbel. These unsavoury creatures herd
together in swarms, and migrate from place to place,
seeking a new feeding-ground when the old one is
exhausted, and seldom staying long in one spot. As
it is never possible to tell where these herds of river
swine are lying with their snouts in the mud, you may
plant your punt fifty times before you light upon a
swarm, and thus cultivate your patience to the highest
pitch of perfection.
In conjunction with the barbel-fishing in the Thames
we may notice the bream-fishing in the different docks.
It seems an odd thing that there should be any con-
nection between the corn-laws and fishing for bream;
yet a connection there certainly is. Certain of the docks
appropriated for the reception and unlading of vessels
freighted with grain became gradually well stocked
with this particular fish, which thrives well upon a bread
diet. Corn that from long hoarding under a high duty
had become weaviled and worthless, was frequently
thrown overboard, and that in vast quantities; and the
consequence was, that enormous specimens of full-
fed, aldermanic-looking bream were occasionally lugged
forth to the light by the amateur anglers of the docks.
We have seen them hauled up to the surface from a
depth of twenty feet, looming through the green water
like the broad, white waistcoat of an alderman through
the reek of a civic feast. Apparently too fat to wag
their tails, they dangled supine upon the treacherous
hook, and only winking a bleared eye under the unwel-
come light of day, 'gave up their quiet being' without
a struggle.
In walking about the streets of London one is struck
with the singularly great proportion of fishing-tackle
shops taken in connection with the actual requirements
of the population. There are some districts literally
crammed with them-quiet, retired spots generally,
where the traffic in other things is small, and the
passers-by comparatively few. The key to this
apparent riddle will be found in the fact, that the
London makers supply the greater part of the kingdom
-that nearly the whole of the fresh-water fishing-tackle
of England is the produce of London manufactories.
The harvest of these tradesmen is of course the summer
season, and they spare no pains to make it as profitable
as may be. At any of these shops you may purchase
liberty to fish in private ponds or streams, situated,
some of them, in distant counties, and contract for
board and lodging at a moderate rate, or at any rate
you choose, during your stay.
But we must proceed summarily to notice the winter
field-sports of the indigenous Cockney with dog and
gun, or with gun and no dog, as it may happen. Of this
class of sportsmen there is no variety: the species is
one and the same, and you might almost fancy it is the
same individual you meet with everywhere, turn your
face in what direction you will out of town on a Sun-
day in winter. He is a sort of hybrid specimen, half-
artisan, half-mendicant, with a dash of the area sneak.
Unwashed, untrimmed, and you may be sure unli-
censed, he saunters forth with his hands in his pockets;
his gun, a long iron-barrelled, rusty old flint, balanced
under his arm; while his unctuous rags flutter in the
wind. He is followed at a little distance by a half-
starved, unwilling whelp, which is too well acquainted
with the vigour of his master's toe to venture his lean
and lanky anatomy within kicking distance, and which
cannot always be seduced by the combined allurements
of oaths, whistlings, and peltings, to participate in the
day's sport. He carries his powder and shot in his
pocket, and measures the charge with the bowl of a
tobacco-pipe; and his game is anything that flies or
runs, from a crow to a water-rat. His impatience for
sport seldom allows him to straggle farther than the
brick-fields, which on all sides of London constitute the

still retains-of the word rencontre. Sixtus V. resolved
to put down this practice, and seized the opportunity
of an unusually fierce combat taking place on Easter-
day within the very precincts of St Peter's.
Next morning an official notice was posted on the
city walls, prohibiting every noble without exception
from being followed by more than twenty attendants.
Every one also, of whatever degree, who should himself
carry, or cause his people to carry, any sort of fire-
(pocket-pistols being especially mentioned), should
thereby incur the penalty of death. At this notice
Pasquin jested, and the nobles laughed, but no one
dared to indulge in bravado, until the following
incident occurred.
line of demarcation between the country and the town.
Here he loads his piece and his short pipe, and
with the latter firmly gripped by his teeth, prowls
among the half-baked bricks, waging war among the
sparrows and wagtails unfortunate enough to come in
his way. He is the terror of the cottagers and gar-
deners of the suburbs, and the admiration of a cluster
of ragged urchins, who gather round him and do his
despotic bidding with alacrity. He never aims at a
bird on the wing; and never, if he can help it, pulls
the trigger without first securing a convenient resting-arms
place for his long barrel. With all these precautions
he considers himself fortunate if he kills once out of
three times; and all the dead sparrows he carries home
cost him at least ten times their weight in lead. We
have met him more than once in the custody of the
policeman, marching off to the station for sending shot
through cottage windows, or leaping garden-fences
after maimed sparrows. It is fortunate for the public
that his recreation is generally over early in the day.
By one o'clock the public-house is open, and even
though his ammunition be not by that time all shot
away, as is generally the case, he cannot resist the vision
of the pewter-pot, which rises before his imagination
as the destined hour draws near. Sometimes a wild
ambition seizes him: he will learn to shoot flying, and
then you may perchance come upon him in some retired
field under Highgate Hill, in company with some con-
genial spirit, furnished with a luckless pigeon tied by
the leg, at which these considerate sportsmen fire by
turns, as the miserable bird rises in the air to the
length of the string. The last time we witnessed this
delectable sport, the string was severed by the twentieth
discharge, and the unwounded bird got clear off, to the
mortal chagrin of the pair of brutes.
Just after the promulgation of the pope's orders,
Ranuccio Farnese, the only son of the Duke of Parma,
arrived in Rome. His first care was to wait on the
new pontiff; and being presented by his uncle, Cardinal
Farnese, the young prince met the reception due to his

gave promise of his becoming a worthy successor to
his father; and the Roman nobles vied with each other
in doing honour to the heir of one of the richest duchies
in the peninsula. On the evening after his arrival he
was invited by Prince Cesarini to a magnificent banquet.
Wine flowed freely, and the night waxed late, when
the gay guests began to discuss the recent edict of his
holiness. Several wild young spirits, and amongst them
Ranuccio, declared themselves ready to brave it openly.

the present gencration of Cockney sportsmen.
CONSPIRACY OF THE CLOCKS.
WHEN Cardinal Montalto assumed the tiara under the
title of Sixtus V., he speedily threw off the disguise
which had enveloped his former life, smoothed the
wrinkles from his now proud forehead, raised his
piercing eyes-heretofore cautiously veiled by their
downcast lids-and made the astounded conclave know
that in place of a docile instrument they had elected
an inflexible master. Many glaring abuses existed in
Rome, and these the new pope determined to reform.
It was the custom for the nobles, whether foreigners or
natives, to be escorted whenever they went out by a
numerous body of pages, valets, soldiers, and followers
of all kinds, armed, like their masters, to the teeth.
Sometimes a noble's 'following' resembled an army
rather than an escort; and it frequently happened that
when two such parties met in a narrow street, a violent
struggle for precedence would take place, and blood be
freely shed by those who had had no previous cause of
quarrel. Hence came the warlike meaning-which it
to the muzzle.
Such audacity could not go unpunished. Without a
moment's hesitation the pope summoned his guards,
and ordered them to arrest and convey to Fort St
Angelo the son of the Duke of Parma, who had just
condemned himself to death. War might be declared
on the morrow; an outraged father might come, sword
in hand, to demand the life and liberty of his son.
What cared Sixtus? He was resolved to restore but a
corpse.
The news spread quickly: so much audacity on one
side and so much firmness on the other seemed almost
incredible. Cardinal Farnese hastened to the Vatican,
and, falling at the feet of the pope, with tears in his
eyes pleaded his nephew's cause. He spoke of the
youth of the culprit and the loyalty of his father, who
was then in Flanders fighting the battles of the holy
see. Ranuccio had been but two days in Rome-might
he not fairly be supposed ignorant of the new enact-
ment? Then he belonged to a powerful house, which
it might not be prudent for even his holiness to offend;
and, finally, he was closely related by blood to the late
pope, Paul III.
The holy father's reply was cruelly decisive. The

law,' he said, 'makes no distinction: a criminal is a
criminal, and nothing more. The vicegerent of God
on earth, my justice, like His, must be impartial; nor
dare I exercise clemency, which would be nothing but
weakness.'
The cardinal bent his head and retired.
Besieged incessantly by fresh supplications from
various influential quarters, the pope sent for Mon-
signor Angeli, the governor of Fort St Angelo. To
him he gave imperative orders, that precisely at
twenty-four o'clock that evening his illustrious pri-
soner's head should be struck off.
The governor returned to the castle, and signified to
Ranuccio that he had but two hours to live. The young
man laughed in his face, and began to eat his supper.
He could not bring himself to believe that he, the heir-
apparent of the Duke of Parma, could be seriously
menaced with death by an obscure monk, whose only
title to the pontificate seemed to have been his age and
decrepitude. Yet speedily the threat seemed to him
less worthy of derision, when he saw from his window
a scaffold, bearing a hatchet and a block, in process of
erection. But who can describe his dismay when his
room was entered by a monk, who came to administer
the last rites of the church, followed by the executioner,
asking for his last orders!
Meantime Cardinal Farnese was not idle. He con-
sulted with his friend, Count Olivarès, ambassador
from the court of Spain, and they resolved to attempt
to obtain by stratagem what had been refused to their
prayers. Two precious hours remained.
"Our only plan,' said the cardinal, 'is to stop the
striking of all the public clocks in Rome! Meantime
do you occupy Angeli's attention.'
His eminence possessed great influence in the city,
and, moreover, the control of the public clocks belonged
to his prerogative. At the appointed hour, as if by
magic, time changed his noisy course into a silent
flight. Two clocks, those of St Peter and St Angelo,
were put back twenty minutes. Their proximity to
the prison required this change, and the cardinal's
authority secured the inviolable secrecy of every one
concerned in the plot.
The execution was to be private; but Olivarès, in his
quality of ambassador, was permitted to remain with
the governor. A single glance assured him that the
clock was going right-that is to say, that it was quite
wrong. Already the inner court was filled with soldiers
under arms, and monks chanting the solemn Dies
Iræ. Everything was prepared save the victim. Oli-
varès was with Angeli, and a scene commenced at once
terrible and burlesque. The ambassador, in order to
gain time, began to converse on every imaginable sub-
ject, but the governor would not listen.
My orders,' he said, are imperative. At the first
stroke of the clock all will be over.'
'But the pope may change his mind.' Without
replying the terrible Angeli walked impatiently up
and down the room, watching for the striking of his
clock. He called: a soldier appeared. 'Is all pre-
pared? All was prepared: the attendants, like their
master, were only waiting for the hour.
"Tis strange,' muttered the governor. 'I should
have thought
'At least,' interposed Olivarès, ' if you will not delay,
do not anticipate.' And monsignor resumed his hasty
walk between the door and window, listening for the
fatal sound which the faithful tongue of the clock still
refused to utter.
Despite of the delay, however, the fatal hour ap-
proached. Ten minutes more, and Ranuccio's fate
would be sealed,
* In Italy the hours are reckoned from 1 to 24, commencing at

Meanwhile the cardinal repaired to the pope. As
he entered, Sixtus drew out his watch, and his
eyes sparkled with revengeful joy. On the testimony
of that unerring timepiece Ranuccio was already

executed.
The body of my nephew, that I may convey it to
Parma. At least let the unhappy boy repose in the
tomb of his ancestors.'
'Did he die like a Christian?'
'Like a saint,' cried the cardinal, trembling at a
moment's delay. Sixtus V. traced the following words:
'We order our governor of Fort St Angelo to deliver
up to his eminence the body of Ranuccio Farnese.'
Having sealed it with the pontifical signet, he gave it
to the cardinal.
Arrived at the palace gates, Farnese, agitated between
fear and hope, hastened to demand an entrance. A
profound silence reigned within, broken only by the
distant note of the 'De profundis.' He rushed towards
the court. Was he too late?-had his stratagem suc-
ceeded? One look would decide. He raised his eyes
his nephew still lived. His neck bare, and his
hands tied, he knelt beside the block, between a priest
and the executioner, faintly uttering the words of his
last prayer. Suddenly the chanting ceased; the car-
dinal flew towards the governor. Ere he could speak,
his gestures and his countenance lied for him.
A pardon!-a pardon!' exclaimed Olivarès. The
soldiers shouted. The executioner began to unloose
his victim, when a sign from Angeli made him pause.
The governor read and reread the missive.
The body of Ranuccio Farnese!' he repeated: 'the
criminal's name would suffice. Why these words, "The
body of ?"
"What stops you?' cried the cardinal, at that perilous
moment looking paler than his nephew.
'Read!' replied Angeli, handing him the pope's
letter.
'Is that all?' said his eminence, forcing a smile and
pointing to the clock. "Look at the hour: it still
wants two minutes of the time, and I received that
paper from his holiness more than a quarter of an hour
since.'
The governor bowed: the argument was irresistible.
Ranuccio was given up to his deliverers. A carriage,
with four fleet horses, waited outside the prison, and in
a few moments the cardinal and the young prince were
galloping along the road to Parma. Just then the
clocks of Rome pealed forth in unison, as if rejoicing
that by their judicious silence they had gained their
master's cause. It might be well if lawyers in our day
would sometimes follow their example.
Monsignor Angeli, as the chronicle relates, was
rather astonished at the rapid flight of time after his
prisoner's departure. In fact, the next hour seemed to
him as short as its predecessor was long. This pheno-
menon, due to the simple system of compensation, was
ascribed by him to the peaceful state of his conscience.
Although inflexible in the discharge of what he esteemed
his duty, he was in reality a kindhearted man, and felt
sincere pleasure at what he honestly believed to be
Ranuccio's pardon.
On the morrow the Spanish ambassador was the first
to congratulate Sixtus V., with admirable sang froid, on
his truly pious clemency. Olivares was only a diplo-
matist, but he played his part as well as if he had been
a cardinal, and made every one believe that he had
been the dupe of his accomplice. He had good reasons
for so acting. His master, Philip II., seldom jested,
more especially when the subject of the joke was the
infallible head of the church; and he strongly suspected
that the clocks of Madrid might prove less complaisant
than those at Rome.
Poor Angeli was the only sufferer. For no other
crime than that of not wearing a watch, the pope

deprived him of his office, and imprisoned him for some
time in Fort St Angelo. As to Cardinal Farnese,
renouncing all the praises and congratulations of his
friends at Rome, he prudently remained an absentee.*
THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON.
October 1851.
THE friends of Sir J. Franklin, and all those interested
in arctic explorations, have been excited and disap-
pointed by the recent news brought from the polar
regions by Captain Penny, who has come home with
all hands in good condition. At headquarters, which
of course means the Admiralty, the intelligence has
been discussed with the usual amount of professional
insight and rivalry, and judgment pronounced accord-
ingly. In order to a proper understanding of the
question, you must permit me to recapitulate various
particulars which I have from time to time communi-
cated. Sir James Ross was, as you will remember,
sent out to look for Franklin in 1848; and such was
the opinion entertained of his abilities, that every one
expected he would accomplish all or more than all of
the work intrusted to him. How miserably he failed,
and how unexpectedly and undesired he came home
towards the end of 1849, will not soon be forgotten.
A general feeling prevailed that we ought not to
abandon the search for the long-lost adventurers while
the slightest hope existed of their being discovered;
accordingly the government resolved on a comprehen-
sive scheme, which should, if possible, finally settle the
question. The arctic sea was to be penetrated from
the east and the west. Captain Collinson was sent out
with two ships-the Enterprise and Investigator-in
January 1850, to try what could be done by way of
Behring's Strait; one of the vessels got well up and
into the ice last autumn, and Captain Maclure, her
commander, hoped to push his way far to the castward
before winter set in, and intended when frozen up to
send out walking-parties in the same direction, in the
hope of falling in with other parties from the opposite
quarter. Captain Collinson wintered at Hong-Kong,
and is now probably following on the track of Maclure.
The next measure was the equipment of the ships
Resolute and Assistance, and the steamers Pioneer and
Intrepid, forming an expedition of which Captain Austin
was appointed chief, and Captain Ommaney second in
command. Two other vessels, the Lady Franklin and
Sophia, were placed under the charge of Captain Penny,
a whaler of much experience and ability; Sir John
Ross came forward to aid the search in a ship fitted
out by private enterprise; and last, the squadron was
increased by two schooners from the United States,
sanctioned by the American government. Besides all
these, Lady Franklin sent out a small vessel on her
own account. The ships sailed in April and May of
last year; and after exploring the shores of Lancaster
Sound and Barrow's Strait, wintered at Cornwallis
Island, having discovered nothing of the missing ex-
pedition except traces of an encampment at which a
number of bones and some pieces of rope were collected,
and considered of such value that they were brought
home to be examined. The excitement created by the
arrival of the Prince Albert, Lady Franklin's ship, with
these relics, and a rumour of a wholesale slaughter of
English crews by Esquimaux, you will probably not
have forgotten. In the spring of the present year,
before the ships were released from their winter
quarters, several walking-parties were organised and
sent out to prosecute the search. By these the northern
and southern shores of Barrow's Strait were diligently
explored; Melville Island and the Winter Harbour of
Parry were revisited; and the vicinity explored up to
106 degrees of west longitude, and up to 104 degrees in
*The above is abridged from the French of Edouard Foussier.
the latitude of Cape Walker. New land was seen to
the north-west, and from the discoveries made there is
reason to believe that Banks Land is continuous with
the land already known on the south of the strait; and
the conclusion appears to be inevitable that Sir John
Franklin did not pass to the westward of Wellington
Channel. It was known that he had thoughts of
attempting this inlet, as Parry had seen it on one or
two occasions clear of ice; the exploration of it was
therefore intrusted to Captain Penny as a special task.
Having forced his way up as far as the ice would
permit, he started with a walking-party to continue
the search; and at eighty miles from the mouth of the
channel came to a second broad inlet, dotted with
islands, stretching away to the north-west, all open
water as far as could be seen, and presenting indica-
tions of the same to the remotest point of vision. This
was encouraging; but as nothing could be done without
a boat, the captain retraced his steps, mounted a boat
on a sledge, went back to the new inlet, which he
named Victoria, embarked on it, and, in conjunction
with his assistants, explored more than 300 miles of
its shores, when provisions failing, he was obliged to
return once more to his ships. Here he found Captain
Austin, and proposed to renew the search with more
efficient means. It appears, however, that his wishes
were overruled. Captain Penny was bound, by his
instructions, to return to England this autumn; and
has recently arrived, bringing with him a collection of
relics obtained from Cape Riley, which proves to have
been Franklin's quarters for the winter of 1845-46.
The relics consist of portions of ropes, part of an
old sail with the name Terror stamped on it, a cask,
and a finger-post: the latter was lying on the ground
near three graves in which three seamen belonging to
the expedition had been buried. Thus all we know
respecting the veteran Sir John, his colleague Crozier,
and their companions is-that they wintered at Cape
Riley during the first winter after their leaving
England; that three of their number died and were
buried; that the ships went away-and then all trace
is lost. Since that time six years have passed; and if
any of the long-lost party still survive, how painful
must have been their sufferings from privation, severity
of climate, and hope deferred!
Captain Austin states in his dispatches that, not
considering any further exploration of Wellington
Channel and its upper waters desirable, he was
preparing to make his way to Jones's Sound at the
head of Baffin's Bay, considering it probable that
Franklin may have got to the north-west by that
opening. So far as is known it has never yet been
explored; and it is considered by those competent
to judge as affording less prospect of success than
appeared in Wellington Channel. To have abandoned
the latter seems like throwing away the only promising
opportunity that has hitherto presented itself; the
more so, as we may believe the open water discovered
by Captain Penny to be one margin of the arctic sea
or polar basin, the existence of which has long been
known, and more than once visited by Russian
adventurers from the coast of Siberia: its diameter
is about 2500 miles. Across it lies the shortest
route to Behring's Strait, and it is possible that
Franklin, if he got up Wellington Channel to the
open water, may still be sailing about it, trying
to find an outlet. What attempt will be made to
verify this supposition we cannot tell until further
news come from the north. Sir John Ross, who has
just reported his return, having left the ice on the 13th
August, brings no additional intelligence: he inclines
to the opinion that Franklin did not go up Wellington
Channel, but that he was attacked, as rumoured, by
the Esquimaux. This again painfully involves the
question. It is said that Captain Penny has offered
to return forthwith to Wellington Channel if the

Admiralty will grant him a steamer for the purpose:
winter, however, would have set in before he could
arrive on the spot.
This subject has led me to greater length than I
intended. I could not, however, close it, without giving
you a complete summary of a question which engages
a more than ordinary share of attention, and so trust
to your indulgence.
chairs;' in magnetic needles;' for a 'pocket - filter
and drinking - tube;' a trap for catching flies;' a
'submarine telescope,' to be used under water; 'for
slitting clothes-pegs;' 'improved machinery for making
pill-boxes;' another is a contrivance which has claims
on the notice of people who wash dishes. According
to the description, the crockery or other articles of
table furniture are placed in a machine fitted to receive
them, and then to wash them by turning a shaft, with
arms and buckets so arranged as to throw the water
upon the crockery with force, and thus act upon and
clean each article.' Another is a varnish wherewith
to protect hams, fruit, and vegetables, composed of a
union of resin, shell-lac, and lintseed oil.' Another is
for improved 'hames,' so fitted to the shape of the
horse's neck as to make the pressure greatest where
the muscle is thickest, and at the same time to render
displacement or disarrangement of the collar almost
impossible, and prevent much, and in most cases all
chafing.' Then comes something interesting to agri-
culturists in their newly-awakened spirit of enterprise
of the roller and the harrow for crushing and pulveris-
ing the soil, with the cultivator teeth for forming the
furrows and depositing the seed, the roller preceding
the harrow, and both preceding the cultivator teeth.'
Another is intended for the benefit of those who incline
to grow honey as well as wheat and barley: it is called
the bee- moth trap,' and 'consists in making the
bottom or floor of the hive of two opposite oblique
surfaces, approximating to two sides of a prism, with a
fluted roller revolving in the partial interval between
their converging edges, which roller is rotated by the
air operating on a vane or wind-wheel on the outside.
This keeps it almost constantly in operation; and as
the bee-bread, refuse of the hive, droppings, and other
matters, fall to the bottom, they are carried out by the
grooves as they come round, and fall to the ground,
the roller thus serving as a cleaner to the hive, pre-
venting the accumulation of dirt and refuse of the
operations of the bees, which are injurious as affording
harbour for the miller, and likewise a temptation to
her to enter the hive.'
To pass from a cold region to a hot one, let me say
a few words about the famous Egyptian obelisk, known
to us as 'Cleopatra's Needle,' and to the Arabs, even
ages ago, as 'Pharaoh's Packing - Needle.' It has
rather suddenly come to be a subject of talk; and the
reason why appears to be briefly as follows:-It is
very old, having been cut from the quarries at Syene,
750 miles from where it now lies on the beach at
Alexandria, in the reign of Thothmosis III., at the
time when Thebes was in its glory. Most of the
inscriptions on the stone were the work of this monarch
and his successor Sesostris, and on this account is held
to be the more interesting. It appears that this obelisk
had been set up on a pedestal near a companion needle-a cultivating seed-planter,' which is a combination
of similar proportions; that it fell down in course of
time, and eventually became half buried in drifting
sand. Thus it lay when the British army, having
achieved a victory in Egypt, resolved on bringing home
the monument as a trophy of their valour. A vessel
was purchased, and machinery and apparatus prepared
for lifting and shipping the ponderous mass in 1801,
when the operations were stopped by order of the
general in command at Malta. In 1820 Mehemet Ali
made a present of the neglected monument to George
IV., thereby confirming our claim to it; but nothing
was done towards its removal; and an enterprising
Frenchman suggested that it might be conveyed to
Paris in the same vessel that carried the Luxor obelisk
from Egypt to the Place de la Concorde in 1830, as
though to rebuke our slowness.
The subject, although half a century old, has not been
forgotten: it was mentioned in parliament, and since
then all sorts of projects have been published for the
embarkation and transport of the huge monolith.
Some say that it should be set up in the courtyard of
the British Museum; others that Hyde Park would be
a more fitting place, as the monument would then
serve as a striking memorial of the Great Exhibition.
Let us get the stone first, and then we will determine
what shall be done with it. Its dimensions are extra-
ordinary-being 64 feet long, 8 feet square at the base,
and weighing about 240 tons. Notwithstanding a
general wish that it should be 'sent for,' an influential
authority states that it is 'scarcely worth the trouble
and expense of the undertaking;' and adds, that it
will cause disappointment if it is expected to prove an
ornament, as it is in a very mutilated state, the edges
being broken off, and the hieroglyphics much defaced.'
The length at present uncovered by the sand is about
thirty-five feet from the apex, with from three to four
feet down the sides; and the whole of what is visible
is in the same dilapidated condition. It must also be
said that the longer it is left in its present position the
worse it will become, from the anxiety of all travellers
to possess pieces of it, which the native boys knock off
largely to sell. The base of the obelisk is about twenty
feet distant from the sea, and the city-wall will have
to be broken through to remove it. The water is only
two feet deep at the distance of fifteen feet from the
shore, nine feet deep at twenty fathoms, and twenty
feet deep at 200 fathoms' distance.' From these par-
ticulars some idea may be formed of the nature of the
undertaking as regards the removal, and an inference
drawn as to its ever being attempted.
Next, there are certain American patents to be
talked about, some of them perhaps more amusing
than useful. Judge for yourself:-For 'improvements
in balloons, and their appendages;' in exercising

Before quitting the subject of rural economy, let me
mention here that the Royal Academy of Georgofili, at
Florence, have offered a prize of 280 francs for a solution
of the question-To determine by experiment the
quality of soil best adapted to the cultivation of legu-
minous plants, and the relative advantages of the
various manures hitherto known, chiefly those consist-
ing of inorganic matter;' also one of 500 francs and a
gold medal for a thrashing-machine to supersede the
present Tuscan mode of treading out corn by horses; and
a third of 280 francs for an essay on the use of salt in
cattle-feeding. Here, at home too, our Royal Agricultural
Society have published their list of prizes which are to
be given for forty-four different implements and instru-
ments, including ploughs, drills, steam-engines, portable
and stationary, pulverisers, crushers, bruisers, chaff-
cutting machines, harrows, light wagons, hoes, rakes,
and any new implement;' and for the best dyna-
mometer especially applicable to the traction of ploughs.'
Competitors are required to have all arrangements
completed with the secretary before next May. There
are, besides, prizes of from thirty to fifty sovereigns for
the best report on farming in Herefordshire and Cum-
berland-on the manufacture of beet-root sugar-on
seeds, and underwood, and other agricultural subjects,
to be sent in by March; and last, one on guano, to be
ready by 1854. It is a good sign to see agriculture
thus on the move for improvements; it involves many
moral as well as substantial considerations.
Now to come back to the American items: a patent
has been obtained for a method of taking sheets of
paper from a printing or paper-making machine by
means of a cylinder or curved instrument that shall

receive such sheets and pile them upon a table provided
for the purpose; and also in combining certain mecha-
nical powers and movements with such table, that the
accumulation of sheets thereon, by bringing into contact
certain parts, produces a movement which causes the
said table to descend in such manner as to keep the top
of the pile upon it at nearly the same height constantly,
the increase of the depth of said pile being used as a
means by which to cause the apparatus for the purpose
to perform its work.' Another invention is for simpli-
fying the weaving of piled fabrics, one part of which is
to use short wires, lapped in the middle for the loops,
instead of the usual long wires. Another, similar in
purpose, cuts the loops on the wires as the cloth is
woven, by means of a reciprocating-knife combined
with the weaving part of the loom;' and with this knife
further combines a take-up roller,' which keeps the
loops parallel, and 'wedge-formed guides,' which insure
that the knife shall traverse truly, and a trough into
which the wires drop, and a second trough into which
they are successively transferred, that they may be
carried back to and under the looping warps,' where
they are ready to repeat their former operation. Another
is for an improved mantelpiece,' made of glass or
similar material, properly ornamented on its back by
paint or otherwise, and surrounded and guarded by a
cast-iron framework, which shields the glass from injury
by accident; said metal-frame serving at the same time
as an ornament, which can be highly elaborated into
any pattern that the fancy of the manufacturer may
suggest; and mantelpieces produced of the greatest
beauty and durability at a comparatively small cost.'
One ingenious inventor proposes to ventilate railway
carriages by a peculiar mode of fixing outside shutters;
another professes to do the same and to prevent the
entrance of dust, by attaching to one of the cars of a
train a centrifugal fan, which is driven from one of
the axletrees of the car: the blast thus generated being
conveyed through the car by pipes, whence it is dis-
charged by adjustable adjutages of peculiar form in the
direction required to prevent the dust from entering
the car. You will see that nothing is said of what
becomes of the passengers while this windy process is
going on. The subject is one of much importance in
the United States, owing to the great heat of summer
and annoyance from sparks and dust thrown off from
the wood burned in the locomotives. Hence the
number of railway-carriage ventilation schemes is great.
I add one more, thus prosily described by the inventors.
They say: The object of our invention is to introduce
into the several cars of a railroad-train a current or
currents of air taken from some point or points forward
of the smoke-pipe of the locomotive, and thereby not
only to supply the cars with the required ventilation,
but at the same time to produce in each car of the train
an outward pressure of air, which will effectually
prevent dust, smoke, and sparks from entering the cars;
and to this end the nature of our invention consists in
combining with the railroad-train a tube or tubes, united
at the junction of each car in the train by a flexible
or yielding joint, the said tube or tubes being carried
farther forward than the chimney of the locomotive to
receive the air in the front of the train, and the said
tube or tubes being made to communicate with each
car of the train, so that the current of air forced by the
motion of the train into the forward end of the tubes,
where it cannot be charged with dust, smoke, or sparks,
may be thus caused to enter each car of the train.' And
next, another gives the shell of a submerged propeller
the form of a section cut from the open extremity of
sea-shells,' whereby the mouth of the helical tube at
which the water enters has a greater area than its
hinder extremity, at which the water is discharged.'
And last, a cunning individual in Alabama is said to
have invented a machine calculated to be highly useful
to the planters. It plants and cultivates cotton with
6
about one-fourth the usual labour to a man and horse,
besides doing the work more neatly and better. It
lays off the rows two at a time, the ridges being made
in the usual way, opens the drill, drops the seed, and
covers the same in two drills at the same operation,
doing the work of seven or eight hands and four
horses. It then harrows and scrapes both sides of
two drills, chops out at the rate of two drills at a
time, bars them, and cultivates, entirely breaking and
stirring the ground the width of two rows at a time,
superseding nearly all the necessity of scraping and
hoeing through the season. The machine is worked.
with one horse, is very simple in its construction, and
needs only one person to manage it.' If this machine.
will do all that is stated, perhaps some of our East
India cotton-growers may be disposed to make trial of
it, and Manchester will not be unwilling to encourage
anything which increases the growth of cotton.
To touch upon astronomy is a sudden change of
subject; but as what I have to say is American, it may
be suitably introduced here. You are aware that the
supposition of a third ring to Saturn has been reported
from time to time for several years past, and at length
verified by observers at Liverpool. The phenomenon
has been perseveringly discussed by United States
astronomers, who, after a diligent examination of it,
and investigating it on numerous hypotheses, have
come to the conclusion that the whole of Saturn's rings
are fluid, and not-solid, and not of equal density. They
are preserved intact, because the satellites are con-
stantly disturbing the ring; but in the very act of
perturbation they are sustaining it in its place. Their
sustaining action is not negative, but positive; and
without satellites there can be no ring.' Among other
conclusions to which they have been led by the inte-
resting inquiry is, that 'delicate micrometrical measure-
ments of the rings shew that they are not of uniform
thickness. May not this accumulation of matter on
one side be the incipient nucleus of a satellite? If so,
it will be reserved for future astronomers to witness a
scene no less amazing than the formation of a new
world within the limits of the solar system.'
We are shortly to get further information respecting
the law of storms-a subject, on many accounts, of
growing importance to science and commerce. A cir-
cular was issued some time ago from the Colonial Office
to parties in foreign countries, and another has just been
sent out by Lord Palmerston to British consuls abroad,
containing a series of inquiries suggested by Lieutenant-
Colonel Reid, who, as you are aware, has done much
towards elucidating the law of storms. In order'-so
runs the missive-' that an investigation of this nature
may be practically useful, it is essential that facts con-
nected with the atmospherical phenomena in question
should be carefully observed and accurately recorded
over as large a portion as possible of the surface of the
globe, by persons of education, and whose scientific
attainments or professional avocations qualify them
for making such observations.' It is suggested that
'captains of ports, masters of lighthouses, and harbour-
masters,' would be competent to the task, as they are
habitually observing the sky. The consuls are to send
home half-yearly an abstract of the information
obtained, and diagrams of the routes of remarkable
storms when they can be procured. We shall probably
get manifold data from many climates: meantime the
Swedish government is about to send out the ship
Eugene on a voyage of discovery and circumnavigation,
with a scientific commission on board, nominated by
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. The
French also are going to explore the Japanese sea with
a frigate, corvette, and a steamer, to promote at the
same time science and commerce, and make an attempt
to renew European intercourse with Japan.
There appears now a prospect of our telegraphic com.
munication with the continent becoming permanent, as

the wire is laid across the Channel, from the South Fore-
land to a point about four miles south of Calais. It
consists of four copper wires of the thickness of an
ordinary bell-wire, cased in gutta-percha, and twined
with a corresponding number of hempen strands,
steeped in a mixture of tar and tallow, into a rope of
about an inch in diameter. Another strand, similarly
prepared, is wound transversely round this; and, finally,
ten wires of galvanised iron, about a third of an inch
thick, are twined round this central core, and form a
solid and at the same time flexible casing. The whole,
when thus completed, has the appearance of an ordinary
4 metallic cable.' The length is 24 miles, and the
weight from 170 to 180 tons. Then there is Henley's
underground telegraph, which, it is hoped, may become
a means of diminishing accidents on railways. It needs
no battery, and can be kept in working order with very
little trouble. It has been tried at the Welwyn
Tunnel, and the directors of the Great Northern have
determined that no train shall enter a tunnel until a
signal has been made from the opposite end that the
preceding train has passed out. Apropos of railways,
the frequent casualties of late have elicited a scheme for
a Railway Passengers' Protection Society,' which all
persons interested in the subject and who is not?-
are invited to join.
Go where you will in London at present you are sure
to hear the means of travel talked about a truly
interesting subject. Projects are afoot for a monthly
line of steamers to the Azores and the west coast of
Africa: a Liverpool and Manchester company are at
work on another line to run to Rio and other ports in
South America, to commence next spring. The vessels
are to be fitted with screws instead of paddles, and
constructed on such models as will insure a speed of
ten miles an hour. This movement, it is said, has
originated in the great and increasing trade of Liver-
pool with Brazil. The departures from each end will
be monthly, the boats calling at Lisbon for passengers
and fuel. It is calculated that the passage to Rio will
not exceed twenty-five days, and that the whole distance
to the river Plate will be accomplished in thirty-five
days, including the detention in Rio to transfer the cargo
and passengers to the branch-boat.' Then there is to
be another line of screw-steamers between Philadelphia
and Liverpool, and Boston and Liverpool: one of the
vessels belonging to the latter is to accommodate 1000
passengers. Another line is to ply from some ports in
Virginia to certain ports in Europe; and last, another
of four vessels, each of 1500 tons, to run from New
York to Genoa, touching on the way at Madeira. If
travelling facilities are to go on multiplying in this
way, we shall soon want other worlds besides our own
to circumnavigate.
I must compress my remaining items, or you will
complain that I am running on to too great a length.
So-Professor Horsford, while verifying the pendulum
experiment in the Bunker Hill Monument, near Boston,
found that the sides of the edifice opposite the sun
expanded every day with the heat. Mr Young, of Man-
chester, has succeeded in solidifying gas-a result which
Liebig said some time ago was one of the greatest wants
of the age.' The substances obtained-a volatile oil, and
paraffine-are entirely wasted in the present process of
manufacturing coke. Cheap coal makes cheap gas;
and now that we get coal cheap by railway, an offer
has been made to lay on' gas to the great parish of
Marylebone, at 4s. per 1000 feet. The number of
bathers at the Euston Square Baths and Washhouses
during the present year has been 15,897; of washers,

medal for a box with the best and most numerous set
of water-colours and brushes-to sell at one shilling
and for the best and cheapest case of instruments. A
fossil human footmark has been found in a red-sand-
stone quarry near Dumfries. What an excitement this
fact, if true, will cause among geologists! And having
occasionally reported to you the proceedings of Mr
James Richardson, the African traveller, I may close
this paragraph with the melancholy intelligence that
the enterprising explorer died last March while on his
travels near Bornou.
Before these lines appear in print the Exhibition
will have closed, the medals will have been distributed,
the bustle of packing and removal will have gone
through most of its convulsions, and the grand and
extraordinary spectacle will cease to exist, except in
books, and in the memory of those who beheld it.
Much will grow out of it: among the first results is a
project for The International Institute;' by which 'it
is proposed that the exhibitors, foreign as well as
British, shall form themselves into an association,
under a title that will commemorate the most interest-
ing epoch in the history of nations, and that they seek
the necessary powers to erect in some central situation
a building upon an unprecedented scale of grandeur,
as an International Museum and Emporium of Arts
and Manufactures; where, as in its great prototype,
the results of science and the choicest productions of
art, in each branch of the world's industry, may from
time to time be seen with the utmost facility for study;
and where the inventive genius of every clime shall
ever find encouragement and timely assistance--where
every new invention shall have a place; where the
inventor and the capitalist shall be brought into
immediate and direct communication; and where,
also, periodical exhibitions would take place, with a
judicious distribution of prizes.'
Would not Smithfield make a capital site for such a
building?
AN INTERESTING PRESSFUL OF BUSINESS-
BOOKS.
We were lately much interested in being shewn by a
friend, who has frequent occasion to use the treasures
of a large public library, the ledgers and other business-
books, along with the miscellaneous correspondence of
a great joint-stock mercantile company. This bare
intimation will not convey to the reader a notion of
much exciting interest, since romance is seldom sup-
posed to be perched on a three-legged stool, or to be
embodied in the figures confined within vertical red
lines. Yet these thoroughly business-looking books
and papers had in them a strong and almost fascinating
interest, and the greater part of our readers will
probably be inclined to sympathise in this feeling when
we state that they were the books and papers of the
renowned Darien Company. That undertaking is
unfortunately too well known in history. Yet to
revive the memory of those whose recollection of it
may be indistinct, and to save them the trouble of
consulting some ponderous history, we shall give in a
very few words a sketch of this celebrated adventure.
The people of Scotland could not fail to observe how
much the commercial enterprise of England had
enlarged its wealth and material happiness, and they
desired to imitate so attractive an example.
An
ingenious schemer, named Paterson, concocted a plan
for effecting this with the aid of English wealth. He
was to obtain from the government certain privileges
for a great trading company; and as these privileges
would, it was deemed, secure to it beyond doubt a very
lucrative trade, it was supposed that English capitalists
would readily take shares in it, and swell the rather
meagre capital to be expected from Scotland alone.
It happened as he expected, and all went smoothly
and triumphantly, when the great English trading
companies took the alarm. They were determined
at all events to prevent their own countrymen from
investing capital in a rival trade, and they got parlia-

ment to take up their cause. Severe measures were
threatened, and the English shareholders withdrew;
but this only served to increase the excitement in
Scotland, and it was resolved to make the adventure
purely national. For this purpose subscription-books
were opened in Edinburgh and Glasgow in February
1696. They excited a complete fervour throughout
the land. Never was railway or mining adventure
more recklessly run after. In a short time L.400,000
were subscribed. This seems a small sum when we
remember that in many a secondary Scottish manufac-
turing town as much railway stock has been subscribed.
But we must take the assurance of contemporaries,
that such at that time was the impoverished state of
Scotland, that only by excruciating efforts, by borrow-
ing, by exacting payment of debt, by selling land, and
by clubbing small sums, could the amount which each
subscriber desired to advance be procured.
When the money was engaged for and partly ad-
vanced, the next question was what should be done with
it? In an evil moment the country went into the dazzling
scheme of Paterson, and determined to create a Scottish
colony. They selected the narrow neck of land some-
times called Darien and sometimes Panama, which joins
the northern and the southern continents in America.
They had thus in view the very object which has lately
been so effectively recommenced-a commercial com-
munication between the Atlantic and Pacific. There was
no end to the dreams of richness and greatness which
this project opened up to the ardent people of Scotland;
but the first necessary step was to get themselves
firmly planted on the spot. With this view an expedi-
tion was despatched, which took up its position at what
seemed a suitable spot, and it was followed by several
auxiliary detachments. We do not intend to go further
here into the melancholy history of the colony, than to
say that it was overwhelmed by disaster after disaster,
and in the end failed utterly. Besides mismanage-
ment and a wretched climate, it had to suffer from the
hostile assaults of the Spanish; and as King William
had taken the part of the English traders, who looked
with jealousy and rancour on the colony, the poor
adventurers, instead of obtaining aid from English
colonies and English ships, were by them treated with
little less severity than by their enemies of Spain. Not
only was the capital lost, but many valuable lives were
sacrificed, and the national pride was outraged. The
event tended in the end to good, for the national animo-
sities created by it shewed the imminent necessity of an
incorporating union of the two kingdoms. This great
project was brought to a conclusion, as all the world
knows, in 1707. Never was a political event so
earnestly deprecated as this connection with proud and
wealthy England was by the equally proud but miser-
ably impoverished Scots; never was event fraught
with so lasting a heritage of benefits to those who saw
in it the harbinger of misery. To get the treaty carried
at all it was necessary to secure some immediate and
tangible benefit to Scotland. Nothing could suit
better than cash in hand; and a fund reaching the
whimsically fractional amount of L.398,085, 10s. was
given by England to Scotland, and received the name
of the equivalent.' It was applied partly to make
up for the effect in Scotland of the larger public debt
which England had incurred; and a considerable por-
tion of it went to reimburse the losers by the Darien
Scheme, who maintained that they were the victims
of English interference, and were entitled to reim-
bursement from English money.

Such is a brief outline of the events of which the
pressful of books and papers to which we have alluded
is the still speaking record; and it will be admitted that
such documents must possess no inconsiderable interest.
A gentleman who superintended the printing for the
Bannatyne Club of some of the letters and other docu-
ments in this collection, gives the following account of
it as a whole, and of the place where it is deposited:-
In an old oak-press in one of the under rooms of the
Advocates' Library, there has been preserved a col-
lection of books and loose papers, all connected with
the proceedings of the company of Scotland trading to
Africa and the Indies, commonly known as the Darien
Company.
"Of these, certain bound volumes were the business-
books of the company; and the loose papers are
letters, accounts, and memorandums, of more or less
importance. The editor has been unable to discover
the circumstances under which this curious collection
came into the possession of the Faculty of Advocates;
but he thinks it probable that, when the affairs of
the company were wound up after the Union, and its
miscellaneous property was dispersed, the oak-press,
containing the business - books of the establishment,
was carried from the office, in Bristo Port, across the
Cowgate, and deposited in the Advocates' Library, as
an institution where it might not inappropriately be
preserved, and which was conveniently near. The
collection has been suffered to remain undisturbed in
its original repository, except that a large mass of the
miscellaneous papers appear to have been collected
together, and bound up without reference to any
method of arrangement. This mass constitutes the
main source from which the contents of the following
pages have been selected, and is referred to in the
foot-notes as the "Miscellaneous Collection."'
The business-books of the concern-journals, ledgers,
stock-books, &c.—are remarkable for their gigantic size,
as if even in them should be personified the vast
ideas and bold projects of the undertakers. We had a
rather startling illustration of their unusual size, since
the friend who shewed us the collection, pulling one of
the largest rather hastily from its shelf, was pressed
backwards by its weight, so that, being encumbered
with a lawyer's gown, he sank on the floor, and re-
quired to be relieved from the huge mass which kept
him prostrate. Save in their size-but rarely rivalled
it would be difficult to distinguish these books from
the contents of a banker's or joint-stock company's
safe at the present day. They are bound exactly in
the same manner in vellum, strengthened at the hinges
by bands of thick leather, fastened with slips of vellum
crossed or platted with a sort of faint attempt at
ornament. And over this regular binding they have
generally a sort of greatcoat of loose, soft, red leather,
to give a temporary protection to the book during
frequent and rapid use.
Nor are the interior aspect and substance of these
books less remarkable than their merely external ap-
pearance. There are few who do not know how irregu-
lar, angular, and twisted is the ordinary writing of the
seventeenth century, and how especially difficult it is
without great practice to decipher accounts of that
period. Now in the inferior books-such as the local
accounts in the various towns, the cargo-books of the
vessels, &c.-we find these cramped, old-fashioned
methods in full use; but we never saw any manuscript
more beautiful and distinct-we might say more modern
looking-than the entries in the great books kept in the
central office. The ink is still singularly black; the
paper fine and white; and in flattening the pages of
an unfinished account one might suppose that the clerk
had just left his desk, and would come back to com-
plete it. The system of double-entry is pursued; and
altogether it would appear as if, under the presiding
genius of the projector of the scheme, a stride had
been at once taken from the old slovenly habits to the
perfection of modern book-keeping. Caligraphers are a
vain race. They count beautiful writing one of the fine
arts-sometimes at the head of them. One can imagine
the pride with which the so-soon-forgotten penmen looked
over these pages, to lie nearly a century and a half in
obscurity, and only furnish amusing reflections to those

who not only know not who they were, but do not, as
in the case of more dignified memorials of skill, care
to know.
Yet though one turns over these ponderous volumes
with interest and admiration, there is one among
them, dirty and torn, bearing marks of much and
rough usage, and full of irregular, and sometimes
illegible scrawls, which is endowed with still more
interest: it is the subscription-book, in which those
who adventured their means in the enterprise signed
their names and set forth the sums for which they stood
good. The date of the opening of the books is 26th
February 1696, and on that day there were subscribed
upwards of L.50,000. On the progress of the subscrip-
tion, it is stated in the introduction to the club-book
already cited, by far the greatest part of the whole
amount was subscribed before the end of March. On
the last day of that month there appears, for some
reason or other, to have been a sort of rush upon the
books. It is noticed on the margin that the subscrip-
tions were continued during the afternoon; and that
day presents 176 separate transactions. A separate
book was opened at Glasgow on 5th March. The total
amount entered in this book is L.56,325. In May and
June the numbers in the general book became scanty-
three, two, and sometimes but one entry being made in
a day. The books were announced to be closed on the
3d of August, and on the 1st the whole sum was sub-
scribed for. The subscriptions on this day-sixteen in
number-give a sum of L.14,125. There was now no
further opportunity for the tardy, the diffident, or those
who could not raise sufficient means, partaking in the
great adventure; and the last of the envied band-
the destined participators in the boundless wealth of a
new world was the provost of Couper-of-Fife, whose
name is pledged by Sir Archibald Mure for L.100.
On that day the royal burghs as a body ventured for
L.3000; and two merchants who were conspicuously
connected with the scheme-James Balfour, merchant
in Edinburgh, and William Arbuckle, merchant in
Glasgow-entered for second subscriptions of L.1000
each. One of the books of the company betrays the
secret of this transaction, and shews that the amount
to which the stock was limited, L.400,000, was rather
beyond than within what the country could promise to
embark. In the "General Journal" there is, of date
2d February 1700, this entry: "Stock invested in the
Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies,
Dr. to sundry accounts L.1000, for so much William
Arbuckle subscribed for, the 1st August 1696, to com-
pleat the quota of L.400,000 stock, p. verbal order of
the Council General; and in regard ditto Arbuckle
paid in the several proportions of sd. L.1000 out of his
own private cash, therefore the Council General ordains
that the said several proportions be repaid."'
In looking over this list, consisting as it does of
about 1500 of the best-off Scotsmen of the period,
one cannot help being struck, almost to a humiliating
extent, with the paucity of great names among them.
After the nobility, notable chiefly through their rank
and power, the only names known at the present day
as those of distinguished men seem to be Andrew
Fletcher of Saltoun, and Sir Robert Sibbald, whose
political profligacy was after all more conspicuous than
his scientific and antiquarian acquirements. Among
men with conventional reputations there are George
Lockhart of Carnwath, the Jacobite intriguer, and the
respectable judge Lord Fountainhall. Some people
would perhaps attach more interest to the entry: I,
Master David Williamsone, minister of the gospell at
the West Church, subscryb for ane hundreth pounds
sterlin,' being, if we mistake not, the identical Dainty
Davy of Scottish song. The clergy are pretty nume-
rous, and so are the physicians, so that these two learned
professions appear to have been at that time in a com-
fortable position. The number of landlords is of course
considerable, but there is a far larger proportion than
we would naturally anticipate of burgesses and other
traders. What enormous strides has Scotland made
since these times!
THE DROP OF DITCH-WATER.
[FROM THE DANISH OF ANDERSEN.]
We all know what a magnifying-glass is-
3-a thing like
a round spectacle-lens, which makes everything appear
a hundred times larger than it really is. Take one of
these glasses, hold it before your eye, and look into a
drop of water taken from a ditch or stagnant pool:
there you will see a thousand strange creatures, such
as you would not have believed could have existed in
the clear-looking drop of water before you. But the
monsters are there, and there is no deception in the
matter. They look like a whole dishful of water-spiders.
See, too, how voracious they are! See how they tear
each other limb from limb! Still they seem to be happy
and comfortable after their own fashion.
Now there was once an old man-all the people
called him Old Creep-Crawl-who would always have
the best of everything; if he could not get it by any
other means, then he had recourse to magic to obtain
his ends. One day Old Creep-Crawl was sitting with a
magnifying-glass in his hand looking at a drop of water
taken from a puddle. Heugh! how it did creep and
crawl! Each individual of the thousands of animals
hopped and jumped at his own discretion, totally re-
gardless of the feelings of his fellows, and they mangled
and killed each other without mercy.
'Horrible!' said Old Creep-Crawl shuddering. ‘I
wonder if by any means one could induce them to live
in ease and peace, so that each one might mind his own
business.'
He sat down to consider and ponder over the matter,
but no good plan occurring to him he called his magic
to assist him. First,' said he, I will give them a
colour, so that one may see them better.'
6
As he spoke, he poured in what looked like a drop
of red wine; but it was more than wine: it was witches'
blood, taken from the lobe of the ear-an extremely
costly preparation, and a very valuable agent to a
necromancer. Instantly all the creatures became of a
general flesh colour, so that they looked for all the
world like a population of wild men.
'What have you got there?' inquired another necro-
mancer, who had no name-a peculiarity of which he
was very proud.
'If you can tell me what it is, I will give it to you,'
answered Creep-Crawl; but I fancy you will not
know unless I tell you.'
The nameless man then peeped through the glass
and saw he saw, as he thought, a city full of wild
men. The sight was frightful; but more frightful still
was it to see how the citizens thrust and cuffed,
slashed and hacked, bit and tore each other. Whoever
was undermost wanted to come to the top, and those
who were above wanted to stop there, and of course to
keep the others down.
'Look, look! there goes one with a leg as long as
my own. Bah! take it away-
Stay, there is one
with a little bump behind his ear-a little, insignificant
bump; but it is an unlucky bump for him, and a deal
of mischief will come of it. The other creatures catch
sight of the bump, they rush at its possessor, knock and
hammer him about, and now they have killed him. In
another place I see one sitting as still and modest as a
maiden, seeming to think of nothing but peace and
quietness. No; she must go out among the others.
There-they dash at her, and she is torn to pieces in a
moment!'
That's queer sport,' said the nameless magician.
It is; but can you tell me what it is?' replied
Creep-Crawl: can you read me the riddle?'

'Oh, that is plain enough,' replied the other. It
represents Paris, or London, or some other large city-
I don't know which, for they are all alike: it certainly
is a large city.'
It is only ditch-water!' growled Creep-Crawl.
EDUCATION IN NEW YORK.
How meanly does the present posture of general educa-
tion in Great Britain, compare with what now prevails in
New York! Let the reader peruse the following speech
of Mr Raymond, one of the representatives of that city:
I am proud, sir, to be able to stand here to-day, and
say that the city of New York offers a free education to
every child within her limits. She has erected about 200
houses for school purposes, with all the appliances of
scientific and mechanical invention; she employs the best
teachers whose services can be procured; she purchases
books, stationery, everything required in such schools-
and then, sir, she throws the doors wide open to the free
admission and instruction of every child within her borders.
There is not a child in the darkest street or narrowest lane,
or the most crowded court of that most densely crowded
city-no matter how destitute he may be there is not
one so poor and friendless that he may not walk up to
the door of the best schoolhouse in that great city, and
demand the very best education which its wealth can
procure. Nor does she stop there, sir. She has organised
eighteen evening-schools, and provided teachers for them,
at which children and adults, whose necessities require
them to labour during the day, may attend during the
evening and receive the rudiments of education. Nay,
more; she has organised and established a Free Academy,
where any child whose faculties and whose industry qualify
him therefor, may receive, under able and accomplished
teachers, and with all the aids and appliances which
money can command, an education equal to that afforded
in the best of your colleges throughout the state.
this, sir, without money and without price. All this, sir,
does New York city provide for the instruction of those
into whose hands her destinies are to be committed. And
all the property within her borders is taxed to pay the
expense thereof. The man with his hundreds of thousands,
and without a single child to reap the advantages of the
schools, pays his tax for their support, and feels that he is
only doing the duty which he owes to the community in
which he lives and with which his interests are identified.
The tax-payers there, onerous as is the tax imposed upon
them, make no complaints that their property is taken for
the use of others without their consent, or that they are
compelled to educate children not their own. They feel
that they are parts of the society in which they live-that
they hold their possessions in subordination to the neces-
sities of that society-and that their interest, as well as
their duty, compels them to aid in the education of all
its children.'
LONDON STATION STATISTICS.
And
The passenger-carriages afford eleven iniles of seat-
room, and would accommodate 40,196 individuals, or the
whole population of two such towns as Northampton.
The loading surface of the goods equals eleven acres, and
would convey 40,000 tons. If the tires of all the coin-
pany's wheels were welded into one ring they would form
a circle of seventy-two miles. To keep this rolling stock
up in number and efficiency there are two establishments
-one at Camden Town and one at Wolverton.--Sidney's
Rides on Railways.
PARTIAL SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION.
Among the heathen nations, the Persians in the time
of Cyrus considered the virtues, especially justice and
gratitude, as the main object of education; among the
Athenians, accomplishments in arts, sciences, and letters
were the end; and among the Spartans, obedience was the
sole principle of instruction, because that would preserve
the ascendancy of the laws. Yet neither of these answered
their designs. Persia acquired some of the milder virtues,
but failed in strength and hardihood; Athens found that
neither art nor science would avail against depravity of
morals; and Sparta found that it was not enough to secure
obedience to laws without considering their nature and
effect; Persia fell a victim to luxury, Athens to licentious-
ness, and Sparta to tyranny. Such are the lessons of
antiquity, and its splendid wreck remains an example to
warn us against the dangers of partial systems. But
under the new light which the Christian system has
thrown over the power and destiny of the soul a different
view has been taken of the end and means of education.
We consider the object of education as twofold: one, to
improve and strengthen the mind itself; the other, to
endow it with whatever is valuable or auxiliary in the
duties of life.-E. D. Mansfield.
THE CHURCH IN THE WILDERNESS.
BY MRS ALARIC WATTS.
[The principal part of the inhabitants of a village in the north of
England, desirous of bettering their condition, resolved some few
years ago to seek their fortune as settlers in the backwoods of
Canada. Having arrived at this conclusion, they waited on the
minister of their parish church in a body to ask him to accompany
them in their wanderings, lest they should forget God in the
wilderness. The good man appealed to his wife, who replied in
the words of Ruth: Whither thou goest I will go; where thou
lodgest I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God
my God; where thou diest I will die, and there will I be buried,'
&c. A small grant from a society established for missionary pur-
poses prevented the pastor from being burdensome to his flock in
the first instance. The little colony is now in a very flourishing
condition; and a description given by the clergyman of their
first Sabbath in the bush to a friend of my own suggested the
idea of the following poem:-]
BENEATH a forest's shadows dim,
Beyond the broad Atlantic sea,
Uprose-strange sound-the matin hymn,
Startling the vagrant bee.
Music those skies had never heard,
Save voice of stream or song of bird.
And youth and age were gathered there
Alike to brave life's changeful weather;
Warrior and peasant joined in prayer,
Bowed down in love together.
There, where no Christian foot had trod,
The wanderers sought their fathers' God.
Their altar was but logs unhewn,
By woman's willing fingers piled.
First offering hers-a fitting boon
Won from the desert wild.
Had sculptured cedar shone more fair
To Him, who owned that offering there.
Sweet words that spoke of peace and love,
Proclaimed in a familiar tone,
The welcome message from above,
To hearts that were his own.
Another fold his flock must find;
Say, could their shepherd stay behind?
Sweet counsel, urged with accent bland,
He gave; but coldness o'er them crept.
He saw he blessed their native land:
The floodgates burst--they wept, they wept!
O England! could thy deathless sway
The Atlantic's waters wash away?
But dovelike Peace at length came down
The fainting heart to heal and bless ;
And Faith and Hope, their joy to crown,
Sprang up in that lone wilderness.
The Lord they sought had there been found;
The desert place was holy ground!

UP THE GAMBIA.
THERE is a river so far under the sovereignty of our
country that she levies custom - duties on all mer-
chandise that enters it- one of the most beautiful
rivers in the world, and one of the richest in the hopes
of civilisation-yet almost wholly unknown to the
English reader. Having ourselves had an opportunity
of visiting the Gambia, and not as a mere passing
voyager, we are in hopes that the slight sketch we
purpose giving of its general aspect will excite the
curiosity of some, and perhaps occasion the surprise of
others.
Before the high land of Cape Verd could be distinctly
traced, we felt that we were approaching the sultry
regions of Western Africa. This feeling increased as
the faint remains of the trade-wind gently wafted us
toward the mouth of the river. All nature now seemed
to become changed. The sky had lost its deep-blue
colour and assumed a light and dazzling hue, from the
sultriness of the air and the reflection of the yellow
sands; the atmosphere was dry and intensely hot,
so that, without any previous agreement, we found all
the ship's company clothed in their thinnest apparel;
the waters of the sea were now commingled with those
of the Gambia, and wore a lighter tint than the usual
waves of the ocean; while one or two large sharks
swam near the vessel, watching if any offal should be
thrown out, or any living creature should fall over-
board. Passing by Cape St Mary we soon anchored
off the island bearing the same name, where the main
channel of this noble river is about three miles across;
although above and below it is twice wider.
St Mary's is a British settlement-the seat of
British government and trade in the districts of
Senegambia since the abolition of the slave-trade.
The island is about sixteen miles in circumference,
and contains 3000 or 4000 inhabitants. Its prin-
cipal town, Bathurst, has a long row of well-built
dwelling and store houses fronting the river, present-
ing a very interesting appearance to the stranger, who
scarcely expects to witness such signs of civilisation on
his first view of life in Africa. The cottages and huts
of the natives lie in the background. Here are to be
found men of all shades of colour and all degrees of
civilisation: it would be a perfect Babel if all were to
speak their native languages; but a broken English
takes the precedence of other tongues. The negroes
who have been located on the island and trained to
habits of industry are in general decently clothed, and
possess comfortable cottages surrounded by little gar-
dens; but groups of people from inland towns are to
be seen in all the rudeness of a semi-barbarous condition.
PRICE 1d.
The mixed progeny of European men and negro women
occupy a middle rank, whilst British merchants and
officers form the caste of the highest order. A few
blacks have by dint of persevering industry risen to
mercantile rank and influence, and they imitate the
English style and mode of living.
The colony of St Mary's is not only a receptacle for
thousands of recaptured slaves-where they learn the
arts and ways of humanised life-but it is a focus of
civilisation, and of its attendant blessings, to the
neighbouring countries. An important trade is carried
on between England and the nations of the Gambia.
Vessels of considerable burden can reach M'Carthy's
Island, 250 miles up the river; and small merchantmen
of thirty or forty tons navigate the stream about 200
miles farther, nearly to the Falls or Rapids of Barra-
conda. As our principal object is to depict the country
and its native inhabitants, we shall not dwell upon the
localities inhabited by foreign settlers.
It was a beautiful day in January when we weighed
anchor to proceed up the Gambia. This month and
that of December, with part of November and February,
are the finest in the year-the only ones in which an
Englishman can perfectly enjoy himself. After this
period the weather becomes intolerably hot: June is a
month of tornadoes; then come two months of rain, and
another of tornadoes, which is followed by the drying
season, the most unhealthy part of the year, for then
the vegetable matter which had accumulated upon the
surface of the soil, and has been decomposed by the
supervening rains, sends forth its pestiferous effluvia,
and causes those fevers which prove so fatal to Euro-
pean emigrants. At this season every one is sick; and
the question is-who shall die or who shall live? But
after two or three years the constitution becomes accli-
mated, and the annual fever is no more dreaded than
the influenza in England. Yet the dull, foggy, dreary
months of our English winter are really delightful to
think of in Western Africa. The thermometer ranged
from 80 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit in the hottest part
of the day; but the air was so exhilarating that it was
difficult to imagine the temperature to be so high.
A sea-breeze which prevails on the coast during the
day-time filled our sails and fanned us up the splendid
stream. An awning was spread over the stern-part of
the deck, and we sat down in the luxury of repose to
enjoy the wonderful scenery with which we were sur-
rounded. This was rich and magnificent-the vast river
appeared studded with promontories and islands, and
its low banks were lined with the majestic mangrove.
This tree grows in the margin of brackish water, and
propagates itself by letting down suckers, which take
root in the submarine soil, at length forming impene-

trable groves of ever-verdant beauty. Wherever the
bank is high enough to be dry, the mangrove disap-
pears, and the plains are decked with other trees-such
as the African oak, the teil-tree, the monkey-bread, the
tamarind, locust, and lofty palm tree. In these open
spaces the natives build their towns, and cultivate the
adjoining land, around which dense forests have
sprung up, the abodes of wild beasts, birds, and reptiles,
of many species.
At nightfall the sea-breeze died away, and we let
down our anchor, except when the channel was clear
and the tide flowing, in which cases the vessel gently
floated up with the assistance of her boat. In the midst
of the stream these evenings were delicious, and our
repose under the awning was safe and sweet. The cry
of the hyana, the howling of the wolf, and an occa-
sional roar of some larger animal, were distinctly heard
as they ranged the forests or scoured the open country
in search of prey; these, and the snorting of the
hippopotamus, as he playfully tossed the water on high,
reminded us of the mighty monsters of Africa. But in
mid-river we were secure from the violence of the
beasts and the annoyance of the insect tribe. The
latter form one of the scourges of these tropical coun-
tries, especially in moist situations. As soon as night
puts on her sable mantle, the mosquitoes issue from
their lurking-places in countless millions, like those
ephemeral insects which bask for a few hours in the
summer heat of England.
Although England claims the sovereignty of the
Gambia, there is still a small French settlement which
was by some mismanagement exempted from British
jurisdiction. In a late war with our opposite neighbour
the king of Barra, the sovereignty of the river-bank,
for half a mile inland throughout the length of his
dominions, was ceded to the English. This old king was
a sad tyrant and a sturdy warrior; nor did he yield to
the cannon and rockets of his civilised enemy without
a severe struggle, in which many lives were lost. He
was as despotic over his own subjects as haughty
towards strangers, treating his people as if they were
his own goods and chattels. If he wished to purchase
an article of foreign luxury, or to buy a horse or a
wife, he sent some armed men to plunder one of his
own villages of its children, whom he sold or bartered
to gratify his desires. On the shores of Barra, the
lovers of lawless fraternity might have found a spot
suited for their Elysium; for no Christian priest has
ever trod this soil, no civilised legislation has ever
corrupted the native mind! Yet they are victims of
wild and gloomy superstition, and the law of nature
seems to be one of unmixed selfishness; for might
overcomes right' throughout these untutored tribes.
6
One morning we found ourselves beside the mouth
of a large creek. These are natural canals penetrating
far into the country, causing openings in the mangrove
thickets, and making watery highways for social com-
munication and commerce.
We entered the boat, and rowed up this creek for
nearly a mile. The sun's morning rays could not
penetrate through the trees, and the breeze had not
yet sprung up, so that there was a shady calm and
stillness almost startling. It is chiefly in these places
that so many English seamen have met their death.
Vessels come up the large creeks for timber, and
the sailors inhale the malaria bred in the pestiferous
woods. Their feverish bodies are deprived of sleep
through the closeness of the atmosphere and the
swarms of mosquitoes; and the disease is aggravated
by toiling under a vertical sun and drinking spirituous
liquors, so that ordinary remedies fail of having any
effect, and whole crews have thus miserably perished.
At this time of the year, and after sunrise, there was
no fear of such miasmata. At length we reached a
break in the mangroves, and found ourselves in sunny
fields with every sign of animated nature. Monkeys
|
chattered over our heads, and hurried down with
their usual curiosity to see the white men; birds of
brightest plumage flew about in countless hundreds;
guinea-fowl, pheasants, and wood-pigeons, seemed to
court the sportsman's gun; the hawk screeched above
us, and a royal eagle winged his upward flight. A
native town lay before at a short distance. It was
inhabited by Jaloofs, who dwell in certain countries of
Senegambia-a name given to the region between the
Senegal and Gambia rivers. The Jaloofs are very dark
in their complexion, but are regular in their features
and of handsome form, approaching the European
model of size and figure. Their hair is short and
curling, and their skin of a jetty black. They frequently
tattoo themselves with gunpowder or the juice of a
certain tree.
The village which we visited was composed of a
number of huts irregularly situated. They were
generally round, the sides composed of wattled cane
supported by strong stakes, and the roof a thatch of
long grass. Sometimes the sides are plastered over
with mud, and the tout ensemble has the appearance of a
large bee-hive. The richer or greater men, who possess
several wives, have a proportionate number of huts, all
enclosed within one fence. A man's riches are calcu-
lated by the number of his wives, whom he employs in
cultivating the soil, and in other ways which bring
pecuniary profit. The women are really a kind of
household slaves, and upon them devolves all the
laborious part of field and domestic work. Nor are
they regarded as fit companions for their husband, but
eat their meals alone, and often find themselves the
scorn of their own children. No wonder that many
Africans regard the birth of a female child as a great
calamity. Poor thing! its prospects for life are very
dreary and disheartening. It is only in countries
where the Bible is made the rule of morals that woman
is raised to her proper rank in society. The Great
Lawgiver, who has denounced polygamy, and declared
that woman should be a 'help-meet' for her husband,
who must love and cherish her as his own flesh, has
prescribed the only efficacious rule for delivering the
weaker sex from degrading bondage or heartless
oppression. Nothing but Christianity will persuade an
African to be married to one wife in lasting wedlock.
His pecuniary interests are concerned in polygamy, for
his wives support him in idleness and dissipation: if
they do not work for him he must work for himself.
Besides, if I marry according to the white man's
fashion, I cannot change in the event of my disliking
her,' is an argument in the mouth of every pagan
negro. Ignorant of love and of domestic happiness, the
haughty African pretends to despise the nuptial bonds
to which the European submits; but their women envy
the state of Christian females. The result of our moral-
ising upon this important subject, after all our observa-
tions made in different lands, approaches nearly to the
old saying that England is the paradise of women.'
6
Most of the Jaloofs are now nominally Mussulmen,
though few of them know anything of the Mohammedan
creed. Their conversion was made by the sword of
some Moorish king, who forced them to acknowledge
God and his prophet; which faith they hold in con-
junction with their native superstitions and heathen
practices. They eat twice a day-in the morning and
at sunset. At the time of our visit they were preparing
to take their early repast, and the chief or headman of
the village courteously invited us to eat with him and
his (male) friends. However, upon witnessing the
provision, and the process of eating it, we respectfully
declined, on the plea that the food did not agree with
us; which was true enough. But we signified our desire
for friendship by accepting a draught of milk presented
in a calabash. The natives sat on the ground round
wooden bowls, and helped themselves with their hands
to a preparation of millet called kooskoos, stewed with a

little meat. The latter was divided with their fingers;
and with the same natural instruments they formed the
stew into little balls, which they adroitly chucked down
their throats. We gave the chief a little tobacco, with
which he was much pleased, and we then withdrew to
our boat. Outside of the men's huts we met a number
of women, who had come to see the white men. Their
dress was a simple cloth fastened round the waist, and
descending nearly to the ankles like a petticoat; but
some of them had a number of necklaces and other
ornaments round various parts of their bodies. The
men likewise wore a cloth about their loins, having
another to throw over their shoulders which the
women also have for full dress.
On another day, as we sailed by the dominions of a
Mandingo king, we paid a visit to one of his towns.
It differed little from that which we have already
described, only it was larger, and the huts were con-
structed with mud walls. The residence of the chief,
who was a 'great man,' was made of the same material,
being a circular apartment with an outer and inner
wall; but a number of huts were enclosed within his
precincts. We were at a loss to discover how any one
could obtain access to the interior, as neither door nor
window at first appeared; but our interpreter shewed
us a small aperture, through which one must creep on
hands and feet, and which supplies the places of door,
windows, and chimney. The palaces of the warrior-
kings are sometimes fortified, and are of larger size
and better workmanship than those which we have
described. The Mandingoes are not so jetty black as
the Jaloofs, and have more of the Guinea style of nose,
lips, and hair; but they are tall and well-formed.
They are a warlike people, and possess many kingdoms
in this part of Africa.
As we sailed up the river, we began to lose the
mangroves, and to form a closer acquaintance with the
alligators, which bask in great numbers on the sunny
banks. The sea-breeze also began to fail us, and our
progress was slowly made by the tides and the towing-
boats. We were therefore obliged to anchor whilst
the water ebbed; but this enabled us to go frequently
ashore, and make short excursions to see the country
where it was not covered with wood. The danger of
wild beasts and serpents, the fear of losing ourselves,
and the dread of meeting with any hostile depredators,
deterred us from penetrating into these vast forests.
The grass also is a great hinderance to peripatetic
movements, as it grows as high as a man's head; but
the natives frequently set fire to it, when the country
presents the appearance of a vast conflagration. There
is a danger, however, of valuable timber being burned
at the same time. So with the corn-fields: the seeds
are planted immediately before the rain begins to fall;
after it is over, the harvest is ripe, the whole process
occupying but a few months of the year. The tops of
the stalks are cut off, the grain is winnowed by women,
and the stubble is subsequently burned.
One day in the course of our peregrinations we fell
in with a village of pastoral Foolahs. We were sur-
prised to see the lightness of their complexion. The
young women especially were very fair, not being darker
than an ordinary mulatto. They were of European
shape, with black, silky hair, well-proportioned, and of
delicate features. As they wore little clothing, they
exhibited their form to the best advantage, and seemed
proud of their proximity in colour to the Tubabo or
white man, with whom they claim a kind of consan-
guinity. The pastoral Foolahs differ from the Teucolors
in colour as much as in their national habits and
customs. The latter are a powerful people, possessing
many kingdoms, interspersed among those of the
Mandingoes and Jaloofs; but the nomadic tribes have
no lands of their own: they are passionately fond of
cattle, which they feed in the territory of any chief
who will not injure them, paying tribute for the right
of pasturage. They are frequently the victims of
those international feuds which the slave-trade has
produced, and are plundered by marauding chieftains,
who live at the expense of their neighbours. They do
not seem to have any definite notions of religion, or
even of a human soul; but while they keep aloof from
the religious practices of other pagans and the dogmas
of Mohammed, they are the victims of many fears
connected with witchcraft and sorcery. Most of the
Teucolors are Mussulmen. A third class of Foolahs
are the Loubies-a vagabond, stunted race, the gipsies
of Western Africa.
Such are the principal inhabitants of this noble river,
which is almost unknown in history, and has never
been celebrated in the verse of a poet. Yet deeds of
war and of barbaric chivalry have been here wrought
which might have formed the theme of many a lay of
Border minstrelsy. The Gambia has had its noted
warriors and adventurers, its councillors, crusaders,
and Robin Hoods. One of the last of these freebooters,
named Kemintang, was for many years the scourge
and terror of the upper districts of the Gambia. His
eventful history and savage deeds of valour and cruelty
might have formed a narrative of no small interest to
the lovers of romance.
The want of authentic records must for ever leave
unsolved some very interesting questions of African
history. How came such a variety of nations, speaking
different languages and having different manners, to be
so curiously intermingled in this portion of the earth's
surface? How is it that these people are now found in
a semi-barbarous condition, while traces remain of
civilisation and mental culture of no mean order?
For the language of a people contains the hieroglyphics
of their former character, just as the Pyramids and
ruined temples of Egypt would convince us of her
ancient grandeur if all literary records had perished in
the flames which consumed the library of Alexandria.
The language of the Foolahs contains words and termi-
nations exceedingly like the names of the old Cartha-
ginian heroes who fought with gigantic Rome.
other respects it bears the marks of considerable taste
and genius: its euphonic and intricate grammatical
changes cannot have been the product of a barbarous
people. It exhibits far richer traits of refinement than
does the dialect of modern Egypt, and deserves the
study of a curious philologist. A rough sketch of its
grammar and imperfect vocabulary of words in manu-
script, by the Rev. R. M. Macbrair, may be seen in the
library of the British Museum. Are these people the
descendants of the once far-famed Carthaginians? If
not, how came they here, with such a colour of skin
and such a language?
In
The Mandingo tongue, altogether different from the
Foolah, may be called the Italian of Africa-so simple,
euphonical, and full of soft vowel sounds. It would
make a beautiful language for ladies, and might be
formed into the melodious verses of Tasso. Whence
this dialect was derived, and how it was moulded into
such pleasant combinations, is another marvel among
the wonders of Africa.
After passing several beautiful islands, only inhabited
by wild beasts and serpents, we reached M'Carthy's
Isle-an oasis of civilisation in this vast desert of the
mind, and as such deserving of separate consideration:
it is one of the brightest hopes of Central Africa. The
river, which below this place is about three-quarters of
a mile in breadth, gradually narrows as far as Fatta-
tenda, where its stream is 100 yards wide, and two or
three fathoms deep in the dry season. Here are
various depôts of European merchandise, as a con-
siderable trade is carried on with the interior by means
of native merchants. The tide rises a few inches as
far as the Falls or Rapids of Barraconda, above Fatta-
tenda. Beyond this point the river is not navigable
for boats, and the country assumes a wilder aspect.

While we tarried up the river the weather became
intolerably hot, and we proceeded downwards before
the coming rains. From the middle of March till
the same time in May, the thermometer stood at 104
degrees to 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade during
the whole of the day. It did not sink lower than 90
degrees in the night. A strong wind blew from the
east, as parched as the deserts from which it came,
drying up every kind of moisture, and filling every
place with light sand. It seemed impossible to stir in
this burning temperature, and we were much annoyed
with the prickly heat in our skin, and with other
inconveniences from noxious insects. In May the
evenings began to grow cloudy, and sheet-lightning
appeared in the distance. The negroes now became
busy in the fields, where the women were employed in
sowing grain. The first shower fell near the end of
May, and in a few days the tornadoes began. These
may be classed with the grandest phenomena of nature.
Due notice of their approach is given by a blackness
which rises from the horizon until it covers the whole
heaven; then a deep and solemn silence prevails, as if
nature were collecting all her energy to swell the
coming blast. Meanwhile all the animal creation may
be seen hastening to their wonted places of shelter:
birds, beasts, fowls, with trembling haste to escape the
storm. Presently a rustling noise is heard, and then a
terrific wind sweeps the earth, as if it would hurry

away everything with resistless violence.
next falls in torrents, not dropping, but pouring, so as
to flood the ground in a few minutes. Lightning flashes
from every quarter of the heavens at the same instant,
illuminating the country in the darkest night, and
making the smallest objects visible. Forked streams of
electric fluid shoot up and down the black clouds, and
rattling thunder drowns every other sound in the noise
of its deafening peals. These tornadocs always blow
from the east; and when overtaken by one of them in
sailing down the river, we took in all sail, and were
blown forward with amazing velocity, scudding on
bare poles till the angry wind had somewhat lulled.
It has been computed by actual measurement that as
great a depth of rain has fallen in one day in Western
Africa as during a whole year in England.
THE DUKE D'ENGHIEN.
M. DE LAMARTINE'S History of the Restoration,' now
in course of publication, will no doubt greatly add to
the author's deserved popularity as a writer, and to
many minds will bring up the recollection of events to
which in the present day there is no parallel. We
confess that we have read the first two divisions of the
work with much pleasure, but also with some degree
of pain. The accounts which M. de Lamartine, as a
faithful historian, finds it his duty to present, are in
some instances a fearful revelation of the lengths to
which Napoleon went in vindication of his authority.
Perhaps nothing in the whole range of history equals
in atrocity the assassination of the young Duke
d'Enghien; and as it is important to have the real
truth unfolded of this terrible affair, we propose, with
the aid of the new lights thrown on it by Lamartine,
to lay it before the reader. It may be of use to begin
with a few words on the genealogy of this hapless
victim of political vengeance.
The Duke d'Enghien was a descendant of the great
Prince de Condé, a member of the family of Bourbon,
who, after signalising himself as a general, died in
1687. The third or fourth in direct descent from this
eminent individual was Louis Henri Joseph, Duke de
Bourbon, who, at the outbreak of the Revolution of
1789, emigrated with many others of the French
noblesse, and held a command in the small army raised
in Germany to fight for the declining cause of Louis
XVI. In this desperate, and, as it proved, vain attempt,
the Duke de Bourbon was accompanied by his youth-│
ful son, Antoine Henri, Prince d'Enghien. Failing in
their military enterprise, the emigrant army dispersed.
Many went to England, and among this number was
included the Duke de Bourbon; his son remained in
Germany, where he resolved to live till better times.
Bidding adieu to relatives and companions in misfor-
tune, he retired to the château of Ettenheim, near the
town of that name, in the archdukedom of Baden.
This was in 1804, when Bonaparte had attained the
position of First Consul of France, and, in the pos-
session of almost uncontrolled authority, had prepared
measures for being crowned emperor. In the selection
of Ettenheim as a favourite scene of retirement, the
duke was influenced by perfectly honourable motives.
He had become attached to the Princess Charlotte
de Rohan-Rochefort, niece to the Cardinal de Rohan,
who possessed Ettenheim as part of his archbishopric.
With the view of residing near this lady, D'Enghien
came to Ettenheim, and there, it is said, he was
privately married to her, the ancient château being at
the same time resigned by the cardinal for the accom-
modation of his niece. When the catastrophe which we
are now about to relate occurred, it is not quite clear
that D'Enghien and his wife lived together in the old
château; and, according to some accounts, the union
had not yet taken place. This circumstance, however,
is immaterial to the narrative. It is indisputable that
the Duke d'Enghien lived in an exceedingly retired
manner at Ettenheim, where he took no part whatever
in political affairs: indeed he never quitted the place
except to pursue field-sports in the neighbourhood, of
which he was very fond, or to make a short excursion
into Switzerland.
It will easily be supposed that at this period Bona-
parte was exceedingly jealous of encroachments on his
newly-acquired supreme power in France; and it is but
justice to acknowledge that he had some cause for
apprehension. The republican armies had put down
external aggression, but within the bosom of French
society secret conspiracies were formed against the
life of the First Consul; and it was generally believed
that the British government privately aided in these
furtive designs. No one can now seriously believe that
English ministers could have lent themselves to schemes
for assassinating even their worst enemy; but Napo-
leon himself always pretended that such was the
case, either through a perverse mistake or with the
view of palliating the act of villany into which
his fears or his vindictiveness unhappily precipitated
him. In the early part of 1804, a conspiracy was
discovered in Paris, the parties implicated being mostly
men of distinction. General Georges had been some
time previously arrested, and those in his employment
stated that he had been visited at intervals by a young
man, to whom great respect was shown. The police
conjectured that this secret visitor was the Duke
d'Enghien, to whose personal appearance he bore a
resemblance. Spies were forthwith despatched to
Ettenheim, to learn something of the duke's move-
ments, and the story they brought back was that the
prince occasionally absented himself from home-the
truth being that at such times he was out on shooting
excursions, and had never so much as crossed the

277
French frontier. These absences, however, were made
coincident with the visits to Georges, the conspirator,
in Paris; and on this flimsy ground of accusation it
was resolved to seize the person of the duke, and bring
him into France. That the seizure must be made by a
military force, and on foreign soil, formed no obstacle
to the French authorities.
Acting under the immediate orders of Napoleon
as has been verified by the statements of his private
secretary, Menneval-General Ordener proceeded from
Paris, under a feigned name, to Strasburg, where he
obtained a large military force to proceed to Etten-
heim. He set out secretly on the night of the 10th of
March 1804, and having arrived at Strasburg, took
counsel with General Leval, Charlot the colonel of
gendarmes, and the commissary of police.
It was
resolved by this conclave to anticipate and facilitate
the capture by despatching spies. The two rascals
pitched on for this mission were Stahl a police-officer,
and a man named Pfersdoff, both being able to speak
German, and act the part of wandering peasants. By
these mean agents the localities were reconnoitred,
and private particulars learned respecting the move-
ments of the duke. The appearance of the spies did
not escape observation: a vague suspicion was created,
but no steps were taken by the duke or his domestics to
avoid a possible danger. Having done nothing wrong,
there was nothing to be feared. Accordingly all proved
favourable for the enterprise. It is here proper to
state that the account of the two spies confirmed a
report which had reached the French authorities, that
Dumouriez, who was known to be engaged in a plot
against the First Consul, lived in communication with
the Duke d'Enghien. This was a mistake originating
in a similarity of names. The person supposed to be
Dumouriez was in reality a harmless French emigrant,
named De Thomery. What mischief sprung from this
silly mistake!
While Ordener withdrew, and mustered his dragoons,
the Duke d'Enghien, with his companions in captivity,
was secured at a short distance from the village in a
send to the château for his dog, his clothes, and his
mill called La Tuilerie. Here he was permitted to
linen; and shortly afterwards, placed in a cart with
his attendants, he was carried forward to the ferry.
At five o'clock in the afternoon of the same day he
arrived in Strasburg, and for security was confined in
the citadel. While here immured for about two days,
he was allowed to write to the Princess de Rohan,
describing his situation. At one o'clock in the morn-
ing of Sunday the 18th, having only had time to dress,
he was placed in a carriage drawn by six horses, under
him. The carriage, travelling day and night, arrived
the escort of several gendarmes, one of whom sat beside
on the 20th March, at three o'clock in the afternoon,
at the gates of Paris; and after a short pause at the
ministry of foreign affairs, proceeded by the external
Boulevards to Vincennes. The carriage, which had
been expected, passed the drawbridge of that fortress,
and stopped in the court at the door of the chef de
bataillon, Harel, the commandant of the castle....
with cold and the moist air. Harel, feeling for his
"The prince descended from the carriage, shivering
situation, asked him to walk up into his apartment
to warm himself by the fire. "With pleasure," said
the prince as he thanked him: "I shall look on a fire
with great satisfaction: I shall also be glad to have
something to eat, for I have taken nothing during the
whole day." A poor woman belonging to a religious
order, who educated the children of Mme Harel,
and who lived outside the castle, was coming down the
staircase from the commandant's quarters at the mo-
ment the prisoner was going up with his guardian.
She heard the dialogue, and drew aside to let the young
man pass. "He was pale," she says, "and appeared
very much fatigued: he was tall, and his appearance
was noble and striking. He was dressed in a long
uniform riding-coat of blue cloth, with a cloth cap

ornamented with gold lace."'
what was to follow, provided an apartment for the duke,
and furnished him with supper. Of this melancholy
'On the evening of the 14th March,' proceeds Lamar-meal the dog which had accompanied his master grate-
tine, 'General Ordener, accompanied by General Fririon, fully partook. After supper the duke wrote a letter
chief of General Leval's staff, and by Charlot, colonel to the princess, and then laid himself down and

towards the ferry of Rheinau on the Rhine, and found wakening.
there, at an appointed hour, 300 dragoons, fifteen ferry-
men, with five large boats; and lastly, thirty mounted
gendarmes, destined to be employed in the violation of
dwellings and seizure of persons, in an expedition more
worthy of lictors than of soldiers. The Rhine was
crossed in silence at midnight; and the column, unper-
ceived during the sleep of the German peasants on the
right bank, and guided by different roads, arrived, as
the day was breaking, at Ettenheim. The spies, whom
Ordener and Charlot had brought with them, pointed
out to the gendarmes the houses which were to be
invested. Colonel Charlot first caused to be surrounded
that which was supposed to be inhabited by Dumouriez,
but which was really inhabited by the emigrant General
de Thomery; and then hastened with another detach-
ment of troops to encircle and attack the house which
contained the principal prey marked out at Paris.
Ordener, with his dragoons, had formed a belt of cavalry
around the town and the paths that environed it, so
that no attempt at escape or resistance should succeed
in thwarting the vengeance of the First Consul.' Early
in the morning, the château of Ettenheim was violently
forced open; and the duke, who was in the act of dress-
ing to set out for the chase, was immediately seized-
resistance, at first thought of, being speedily shewn to
be impracticable. The prince was dragged away from
his residence without being permitted to take a last
farewell of her whom he left swooning and in tears.
Little was the unfortunate prince aware of the
measures that had been adopted to insure his destruc-
tion. Already within a room of the castle a mock
tribunal had been formed by the nomination of Murat,
governor of Paris. The names of the miscreants who
composed this sham court were General Hullin, presi-
dent; Colonels Bazancourt, Barrois, Guitton, Ravier,
and Rabbe; D'Autencourt, judge-advocate; and Molin,
chief-secretary. Promptitude, silence, secrecy were
enjoined; and the trial was to be only a method of
passing sentence. Savary, who appears to have been
deeply implicated in hurrying the duke to his fate,
attended as a spectator to prevent any mismanage-
ment. We again take up the thread of Lamartine's
narrative.
'It was eleven o'clock at night, when the lieutenant,
Noirot, and the two gendarmes, Thersis and Lerva,
entered the room where the young prince was asleep.
These men had tender hearts under the rude uniform
of their profession, and they have since avowed how
much it cost them to interrupt thus, by the summons
of death, the only happiness which a captive can taste,
and how gladly they would have prolonged, at least for
some minutes, the repose or the dreams of the prince,
who was a soldier like themselves. But the tribunal
and Savary were waiting. They awakened the prince
without precipitation, and without harshness of word
or gesture, and he could perceive pity in their eyes

and in their accents. He dressed himself in the same
clothes as the evening before. He buttoned his gaiters,
and put on his travelling-cap, uncertain whether they
had called him to make an appearance or to depart;
and he permitted his dog, which had slept at his feet,
to follow him. He then went with the lieutenant and
the two gendarmes through the staircases, the corridors,
and the courts, and was introduced into the chamber
adjoining the saloon of Iarel, where he found himself
in the presence of the judge-advocate, D'Autencourt.
It was then midnight, as it appears by the date of the
examination.' To D'Autencourt's questions as to who
and what he was, and what had been his mode of life
and actions, he gave simple and explicit answers, not
one of which could associate him in any respect with a
conspiracy; and he finally begged to be allowed to
have an interview with the First Consul. This request
was not acceded to. Before his assumed judges, to
whom he was immediately introduced, the same plain
answers were given to all interrogatories. The trial
was a burlesque on justice. The accused was con-
fronted with no witnesses; no documentary evidence
was produced against him; he was allowed no advocate
-a point in itself clearly illegal. There was literally
nothing to criminate the prince but suspicion, and that
founded on mistakes. Anxiously was he pressed to
reveal the particulars of the conspiracy in which he
was presumed to be engaged. He could only tell that
he had borne arms against France, but in honourable
warfare; and that, as a Bourbon, he must naturally
retain a feeling of hostility against the revolutionary
government. He also confessed that he had for some
time been dependent for subsistence on bounty kindly
extended to him by England. Having with a noble
candour given these explanations, the accused was
ordered to withdraw. Savary, the officers of the legion
of gendarmerie and of the line, and the spectators also,
retired to allow the judges to deliberate in silence and
secrecy. Their deliberation lasted no longer than
was required by decency to give them an appearance
of having reflected, when, with a unanimous voice,
they pronounced him guilty of having borne arms
against the French republic; of being in communication
with England, and concerned in conspiracies against
the life of the First Consul. The sentence-death!
""Let it go forth," said the president of this tribunal,
"to the times in which we live, that, having been
appointed judges, we have been compelled to give
judgment under the penalty of being judged ourselves!"
They forgot, however, that they could not be judges
without a culprit, and that he who was brought before
them was not amenable to their tribunal, but was an
exile dragged before his enemies with the bayonet at
his throat. They also forgot that they would indeed
be judged by the equity of the world, by their own
conscience, and by the Almighty.
As soon as the judgment was pronounced, and even
before it was drawn up, Hullin sent to inform Savary
and the judge-advocate of the sentence of death, in
order that they might take their measures for its exe-
cution. It seemed as if the time was equally pressing
to the tribunal as to those who awaited their decision,
and as if an invisible genius was hurrying along the
acts, formalities, and hours, in order that the morning's
sun might not witness the deeds of the night. Hullin
and his colleagues remained in the hall of council, and
drew up at random the judgment they had just given;
and this short and unskilfully prepared document
(summing up a whole examination in two questions
and two answers) terminated with the order to execute
the sentence forthwith.'
As the execution on the open esplanade of the castle
might have led to unpleasant consequences, Savary
resolved to have it perpetrated within the fosse of the
fortification. 'Harel received orders to give up the
keys of the iron gateways and steps which descended
from the towers, and opened on the foundations of the
château, to point out the different outlets and sites, and
to procure a gravedigger to commence opening a grave
while the man for whom it was intended still breathed.
A poor working gardener of the château, named
Bontemps, was aroused, and his work pointed out to
him. He was furnished with a lantern to guide him
through the labyrinth of the moat, and light him while
he dug the pit. Bontemps descended with his shovel
and pickaxe to the bottom of the moat, and finding the
ground all about dry and hard, he recollected that they
had begun to dig a trench the evening before at the
foot of the Queen's Pavilion, in the angle formed by
the tower and a little parapet wall, for the purpose,
it was said, of depositing rubbish in it. He accordingly
went to the foot of the tower, marked out in paces the
measure of a man's body extended at length, and dug
in the earth, that had been already moved, a grave for
the corpse they were preparing for it. The Duke
d'Enghien could have heard from his window, over
the humming noise of the troops below, the dull and
regular sound of the pickaxe which was digging his
last restingplace.
'Savary at the same time marched down and ar-
ranged slowly in the moat the detachments of troops
who were to witness this military death, and ordered
the firing-party to load their muskets.
"The prince was far from suspecting either so much
rigour or so much haste on the part of his judges. He
did not doubt that even a sentence of death, if awarded
by the commission, would give occasion for an exhi-
bition of magnanimity on the part of the First Consul.
He had granted an amnesty to emigrants taken with
arms in their hands; how could it be doubted, then,
that he who pardoned obscure and culpable exiles
would not honour himself by an act of justice or cle-
mency towards an illustrious prince, beloved by all
Europe, and innocent of all crime?
'He had been taken back, after his interrogatories
and his appearance before the military commission,
into the room where he had slept. He entered it
without exhibiting any of that terror which prisoners
experience in the anxiety and uncertainty of their sen-
tence. With a serene countenance and unembarrassed
mind he conversed with his gendarmes and played
with his dog. Lieutenant Noirot, who was on guard
over him, had formerly served in a regiment of cavalry
commanded by a colonel who was a friend of the Prince
of Condé. He had also seen the Duke d'Enghien, when
a child, sometimes accompany his father to reviews
and field-days of the regiment; and he reminded the
prince of that period and these circumstances of his
youth. The duke smiled at these reminiscences, and
renewed them himself by other recollections of his
infancy, which mingled with those of Noirot. . . . . A
noise of footsteps, advancing slowly towards the cham-
ber, interrupted this agreeable and last indulgence
of captivity. It was the commandant of Vincennes,
Harel, accompanied by the brigadier of the gendarmerie
of the village, Aufort. This friend of Harel had been
permitted to remain in one of the commandant's rooms,
after having ordered the prince's supper, and from
thence he had heard or seen all the events of the night.
Harel, agitated and trembling at the mission he had to
fulfil, had permitted Aufort to follow and assist him in
his message to the prisoner.
"They saluted the prince respectfully, but neither of
them had the firmness to acquaint him with the truth.
The dejected attitude and trembling voice of Harel
alone revealed to the eye and the heart of the prince
a fatal presentiment of the rigour of his judges. He
thought they now came for him only to hear his sen-
tence read. Harel desired him, on the part of the
tribunal, to follow him, and he went before with a
lantern in his hand, through the corridors, the pas-
sages, and the courts it was necessary to cross to

arrive at the building called the "Devil's Tower."
The interior of this tower contained the only staircase
and the only door descending to and opening into the
lowest moat. The prince appeared to hesitate two or
three times on going into this suspicious tower, like a
victim which smells the blood, and which resists and
turns back its head on crossing the threshold of a
slaughter-house.
Savary, while waiting till the prisoner had descended
to the place of execution, and till the detachments and
firing-party had been drawn up on the ground, was
warming himself, standing by Harel's fire, in the hall
where the trial had taken place. Hullin, after having
sent off his procès verbal of condemnation, was sitting
at the table, with his back turned towards Savary.
Hoping that the sentence would be commuted by the
power and clemency of the First Consul, he began
reading, in his own name and in the name of all his
colleagues, a letter to Bonaparte, to communicate to
him the desire that the accused had expressed of
obtaining an audience of him, and to supplicate him to
remit a punishment which the rigour of their functions
alone had forced them to award. "What are you
doing?" said the man after Bonaparte's heart, approach-
ing Hullin. "I am writing to the First Consul," said
the president, "to acquaint him with the request of
the condemned, and the wishes of the council." But
Savary, taking the pen from the hands of the presi-
dent, said to him, "Your business is done; the rest
is mine."
'Hullin yielded to the authority of the general, and
arose mortified at being deprived of the privilege of
recommending a prisoner to mercy, which is inherent
in all tribunals and military commissions. He thought
that Savary claimed this privilege for himself, and he
complained to his colleagues of a despotism which left
the remorse more heavy on their consciences. He then
prepared to return with them to Paris.
'Harel and Aufort preceded the duke in silence
down the steps of the narrow winding staircase, which
descended to a postern through the massy walls of this
tower. The prince, with an instinctive horror of the
place, and of the depth beneath the soil to which the
steps were leading him, began to think they were not
conducting him before the judges, but into the hands
of murderers, or to the gloom of a dungeon. He trem-
bled in all his limbs, and convulsively drew back his
foot, as he addressed his guides in front: "Where are
you conducting me?" he demanded with a stifled
voice. "If it is to bury me alive in a dungeon, I
would rather die this instant." "Sir," replied Harel
turning round, "follow me, and summon up all your
courage." The prince partly comprehended him, and
followed.
แ
"They at length issued from the winding staircase
through a low postern, which opened on the bottom of
the moat, and continued walking for some time in the
dark, along the foot of the lofty walls of the fortress, as
far as the basement of the Queen's Pavilion. When
they had turned the angle of this pavilion, which had
concealed another part of the moat behind its walls, the
prince suddenly found himself in front of the detach-
ment of the troops drawn up to witness his death.
The firing-party selected for the execution was sepa-
rated from the rest; and the barrels of their muskets,
reflecting the dull light of some lanterns carried by a
few of the attendants, threw a sinister glare on the
moat, the massy walls, and the newly-dug grave. The
prince stopped at a sign from his guides within a few
paces of the firing-party. He saw his fate at a glance,
but he neither trembled nor turned pale. A slight and
chilling rain was falling from a gloomy sky, and a
melancholy silence reigned throughout the moat. No-
thing disturbed the horror of the scene but the whisper-
ing and shuffling feet of a few groups of officers and
soldiers who had collected upon the parapets above,
and on the drawbridge which led into the forest of
Vincennes.
'Adjutant Pellé, who commanded the detachment,
with his eyes lowered, advanced towards the prince.
He held in his hand the sentence of the military com-
mission, which he read in a low dull voice, but perfectly
intelligible. The prince listened without making an
observation or losing his firmness. He seemed to have
collected in an instant all his courage, and all the
military heroism of his race, to shew his enemies that
he knew how to die. Two feelings alone seemed to
occupy him during the moment of intense silence which
followed the reading of his sentence: one was to invoke
the aid of religion to soothe his last struggle, and the
other to communicate his dying thoughts to her he was
going to leave desolate on earth.
'He accordingly asked if he could have the assistance
of a priest, but there was none in the castle; and though
a few minutes would suffice to call the curé of Vin-
cennes, they were too much pressed for time, and too
anxious to avail themselves of the night, which was to
shroud everything. The officers nearest to him made a
sign that he must renounce this consolation; and one
brutal fellow, from the midst of a group, called out in
a tone of irony: "Do you wish, then, to die like a
Capuchin ?”
The prince raised his head with an air of indignation,
and turning towards the group of officers and gendarmes
who had accompanied him to the ground, he asked in
a loud voice if there was any one amongst them willing
to do him one last service. Lieutenant Noirot advanced
from the group and approached him, thus sufficiently
evincing his intention. The prince said a few words to
him in a low voice, and Noirot, turning towards the
side occupied by the troops, said: "Gendarmes, have
any of you got a pair of scissors about you?" The
gendarmes searched their cartridge-boxes, and a pair
of scissors was passed from hand to hand to the
prince. He took off his cap, cut one lock from his
hair, drew a letter from his pocket, and a ring from his
finger; then folding the hair, the letter, and the ring in
a sheet of paper, he gave the little packet, his sole
inheritance, to Lieutenant Noirot, charging him, in the
name of pity for his situation and his death, to send
them to the young Princess Charlotte de Rohan at
Ettenheim.
"This love-message being thus confided, he collected
himself for a moment, with his hands joined, to offer up
a last prayer, and in a low voice recommended his soul
to God. He then walked a few paces, to place him-
self in front of the firing-party, whose loaded muskets
he saw glimmering at a short distance. The light of a
large lantern, containing several candles, placed upon
the little wall that stood over the open grave, gleamed
full upon him, and lighted the aim of the soldiers.
The firing-party retired a few paces to a proper dis-
tance, the adjutant gave the word to fire, and the young
prince, as if struck by a thunderbolt, fell upon the
earth, without a cry and without a struggle. At that
moment the clock of the castle struck the hour of
three.
Hullin and his colleagues were waiting in the ves-
tibule of Harel's quarters for their carriage to convey
them back to Paris, and were talking with some bitter-
ness of Savary's refusal to transmit their letter to his
master, when an unexpected explosion, resounding
from the moat of the forest gate, made them start and
tremble, and taught them that judges should never
reckon upon anything but justice and their own con-
science. This still small voice pursued them through
their lives. The Duke d'Enghien was no more.
His dog, which had followed him into the moat,
yelled when he saw him fall, and threw himself on the
body of his master. It was with difficulty the poor
animal could be torn away from the spot, and given to
one of the prince's servants, who took him to the

Princess Charlotte - the only messenger from that
tomb where slept the hapless victim whom she never
ceased to deplore. They placed him, dressed as he was,
in the grave dug under the wall; and they buried with
him his money, his watch, his rings, his trinkets, and a
chain that he wore round his neck. They took nothing
from the pocket of his coat but the diary of his journey,
which Hullin put under cover, and addressed to Réal
for the First Consul.' It is only necessary to add that
Napoléon, on hearing the whole circumstances of the
case, said, 'Tis well!' It is known that he afterwards
loaded the murderers of the Duke d'Enghien with
wealth and honours.
The finishing scene of this terrible drama remains to
be noticed. On the day after the execution, a post-
chaise with four horses, containing a young lady and an
old man, drove up to the door of the inn at Vincennes.
The lady was the Princess de Rohan, and the aged man
was her father. The princess had hurried from the
borders of the Rhine to implore pardon for him she
loved. She arrived in time only to learn his death, and
to mourn a separation till reunited in a better world.
Every sort of shuffle has been resorted to for the
purpose of screening Bonaparte from the obloquy of
this horrible act, but without avail. At St Helena he
justified the deed on the ground of the conspiracies
known to be carrying on against his life, and the
necessity for striking terror into the Bourbons and their
adherents. Hullin, Savary, and some other agents of
Napoleon, have in their published memoirs endeavoured
to free themselves from blame by throwing the burden
of guilt on others. Hullin, going beyond the rest in
expressions of regret, speaks of suffering pangs of
remorse for the part he was compelled to act; but
as these penitential feelings were paraded during the
reign of the restored Bourbons, their sincerity may
admit of some degree of doubt. History, which clears
up state-mysteries, has fully demonstrated the entire
innocence of the unfortunate D'Enghien. By one of
the most recent revelations, it is evident that through-
out the whole affair the duke had been mistaken for
the young Count Jules de Polignac, who was the real
party that had been in communication with Georges in
Paris! This fact only aggravates the injustice perpe-
trated by Napoleon, whose doom we shall suffer the
honest Lamartine to pronounce, in words ever to be
remembered.
"Neither mankind nor history will ever pardon the
spilling of this innocent blood by Napoleon. A tomb
has been raised to him under the dome built by
Louis XIV. at the Palace of the Invalids, where
the statues of twelve victories, hewn out from one
single block of granite, harmonising with the massy
pillars which support the lofty edifice, seem to stand
the sentinels of ages around the urn of porphyry which
contains his bones. But there is in the shade, and
seated on the sepulchre, an invisible statue which tar-
nishes and blights all the others-the statue of a young
man, torn by hired nocturnal assassins, from the arms
of her he loved, from the inviolable asylum in which
he confided, and slaughtered by the light of a lantern
at the foot of the palace of his sires. People go to
visit, with a cold curiosity, the battle-fields of Marengo,
of Austerlitz, of Wagram, of Leipsic, and of Waterloo;
they walk over them with dry eyes; then they are
shewn at the angle of a wall round the foundations of
Vincennes, at the bottom of a trench, a place covered
with nettles and marsh-mallows, and they exclaim: "It
is there!" With a cry of indignation they carry from
the spot an eternal pity for the victim and an impla-
cable resentment against the assassin! This resentment
is a vengeance for the past; but it is also a lesson for
the future. Let the ambitious, whether soldiers, tri-
bunes, or kings, reflect, that if there are mercenary
soldiers to serve them, and flatterers to excuse them
while they reign, there is the conscience of humanity
afterwards to judge them, and pity to detest them.
The murderer has but his hour the victim has
eternity!'
THE BLOOMER COSTUME,
SEVERAL spirited ladies of the United States have
made their appearance at the head of a movement for
the reform of the female dress. A Mrs Bloomer of
New York is the literary advocate of the party, and
from her it seems likely to take an appellation. Other
ladies have begun to act as apostles of the cause, not
merely by writing and lecturing, but by exemplifying
the new costume on their own persons, appearing as a
sign to the people, to use the phrase of Robert Barclay
of famous memory, when he walked into the streets of
Aberdeen without any dress at all.
The Bloomer reformation has not been well received
in this country. By association and otherwise, it
excites too much merriment to be held in much
respect. Accordingly, some of the apostles have been
treated in a manner rather martyrly. This is all very
natural. First, there is a great standing absurdity
which provokes the wrath of all rational minds. Some
one starts off in a crusade against it, and goes to the
opposite extreme. The public, tolerant of the first
error from habit, hoots the second because it is new,
failing to observe the good which is at the bottom of it.
So it is that our people see women every day defying
common sense and good taste by the length of their
skirts, and say little about it, but no sooner observe
one or two examples of a dress verging a little too far
in an opposite direction, than they raise the shout of a
persecuting ridicule. We say there may be some little
extravagance in the Bloomer idea, but it is common
sense itself in comparison with the monstrous error
and evil which it seeks to correct.
That some reform is wanted all the male part of
creation agree. Many of the ladies, too, admit the
inconvenience of the long skirts which have been for
some years in fashion, though they profess to be
unable to break through the rule. Why should not
some compromise be entered into? In order to avoid
trailing through mud and dust, it is not necessary to
dock petticoats and frocks by the knee, or to assume a
masculinity in other parts of the attire. Neither is it
necessary to connect a rational length of skirt with
certain unhappy foolish notions about equal privileges
of the sexes, which seems to be one of the mistakes
made by the Bloomer party in America. Let there
simply be a reduction of the present nuisance, an
abbreviation of those trolloping skirts by which even a
man walking beside the wearer is not unfrequently
defiled. When the hem of the garment is on the level
of the ankle, which once was the case, it answers all
the purposes of decorum, and is sufficiently cleanly.
A return to that fashion would do away with all objec-
tion. Or if one or two inches more be taken off,
and the void filled by such trousers as are generally
worn by young girls, it might be as well, or better.
Such changes might be brought about with little fracas,
like any of the ordinary changes of fashion.
If the question is between the present skirts and
Bloomerism, then we are Bloomerites; for we would
rather consent to error in the right direction than the
wrong one.
We have alluded to fashion and its slavery. It is a
curious subject, not unworthy of even a philosophic
attention. In the late wondrous exhibition of the
industrial arts of the civilised world, how many admi-
rable devices were presented for articles of utility and
ornament! What an idea did it in its general effect
give of the amount of ingenious intellect exercised on
such matters! Yet we never see any of the same taste
and ingenuity exercised in the fashioning of clothes.
Milliners and tailors appear to be the most brainless of

all professions. We scarcely remember to have ever
seen a new fashion proceed from them which accorded
with true elegance, and which did not tend to deform
rather than adorn the human person. At present they
make a woman into a bell-shaped object, painful from
the sense of its incompleteness-feet being wanting.
Always some absurdity reigns conspicuous in their
models of form. Each of them will tell you: We cannot
help it it is the fashion. But whence comes the
fashion, if not from some of their own empty heads?
And how is it that no one of them can help it, but
that no one of them has the sense or spirit to devise,
set forth, and promote anything better? The tailors
are better than the milliners, and do not in general
misdress mankind to such an extent as to call for a
particular effort of resistance; but the women are
treated by their dressmakers in a way which would
call for and justify a rebellion. A friend of ours goes
so far as to say that the one thing above all which
convinces him of the inferiority of the female mind
generally to the male, is the submission which women
shew to every foolish fashion which is dictated to them,
and that helplessness which they profess under its
most torturing and tyrannical rules. We would at
least say that, if there is folly in a fantastic dissent
such as that of Mrs Bloomer and her friends-there is
a far greater self-condemnation of the judgment in
adherence to an absurdity which involves filthiness as
well as inelegance, like the present long skirts.
LOTTERIES IN NORTHERN ITALY.
In travelling through various states of Germany and
Italy, it may be observed by placards on the walls that
the lottery still exists as an institution recognised and
regulated by public authority. Of course, one feels
inclined to despise governments which countenance
this species of gambling; but as we all recollect the
days of state-lotteries in England, with the vociferous
advertisements about lucky offices,' the disposition
utterly to condemn these continental authorities is a
good deal modified. Civilisation goes on by slow steps,
and it does not do for one country to abuse another for
its backwardness.
Let us, however, for the sake of a little amusement,
describe the lottery-system of Piedmont. There the
game of purchasing tickets and drawing numbers is
rather curious. The numbers in each lottery are only
from one to ninety. He who wishes to play goes to a
lottery-office, and dictates any of these numbers he
pleases to the office - keeper, who writes them upon
a double register. You may put as many numbers as
you please in one ticket, or separate them into several.
This done, the office-keeper cuts off from the register
the tickets demanded-of which the duplicate remains
-and gives them to you in exchange for your money.
The men employed in the lottery are paid no salary,
but are entitled to 8 per cent. on the receipts. When
the day comes for drawing, five numbers are publicly
extracted from a wheel containing from one to ninety,
and the winning tickets are those inscribed with
either two, three, or four of these numbers, which
have come out. A single number guessed gives no
right to anything. The guessing of two numbers
called ambo is paid 270 times the amount of money
staked; three numbers guessed-a terno-bring 5500
times; and, finally, four entitle to 60,000 times the
stake.
At first sight, to any one inexperienced in this species
of gaming, winning seems very easy. It only requires
to put a great many numbers in one ticket-say twenty
or thirty-and with a little perseverance one is almost
sure to win. But, practically, although the quantity
of numbers does indubitably increase the chances of
winning, it augments also in an alarming proportion
the various combinations of these numbers, and conse-
quently the amount of money that must be staked.
A franc staked upon cach combination is the rate at
which a fair sum may be realised in case of winning;
but although a franc is the minimum staked on every
ticket, there is likewise a minimum for the stake on
each variety of combination-of ten centimes for each
ambo, and of five for each terno and quaterno. This
is the way in which generally poor people-who are the
majority-play, and this is the reason why the prizes
of terno and quaterno, which are not uncommon, are
generally very small.
Every object in nature is represented by a number;
but of course, as there are only ninety of these numbers,
while things in existence are innumerable, a multiplicity
of them come under the same head. In each lottery-
office there hangs a table of the ninety numbers, each
occupying a square, which contains, rudely coloured,
the thing or things represented by their respective
number. This table is daily examined and consulted
by amateurs, to what profit it is vain to ask. There is
also at your disposal in every lottery-office a precious
book entitled 'A Key to Dreams.' Even Christian
names have their corresponding numbers; and to each
number from one to ninety is annexed the name of a
poor woman, who receives fifty francs (a good idea this!)
when the number to her assigned comes up. The names
of these ninety women, followed by the names of their
fathers, form a register, which any one may consult.
Now suppose you have dreamed of a Rosa or a Caterina,
what have you to do? Just to turn over the above-
mentioned list, and the number to which is annexed the
name of a Rosa or a Caterina is the one you are in
search of. The same for names of men. You see that
nothing has been forgotten, and that every case is fore-
seen and provided for.
The lottery is drawn eight-and-forty times in the
year, four times each month, alternately at Turin and
Genoa every Saturday at mid-day. When there
chances to fall five Saturdays in one month, on the fifth
there is no drawing. This ceremony is not very im-
posing. At Genoa it takes place in a low, dirty room
in the ducal palace, in presence of a limited public,
invariably composed of soldiers, sailors, street-porters,
and market-women some hundred and fifty, not
counting the babies that these ladies, young or old,
always carry in their arms.
The remaining space
in the hall is occupied by a platform, like the stage
of a theatre, at each extremity of which there is a
large wheel suspended by swivels upon a stand. By
the side of each of these wheels, in the attitude of
two guardian genii, stand two charity boys in blue
surtouts, blue sashes, white cotton gloves, and huge
shirt - collars, to make amends for an absent cravat.
Each couple is possessed of a white handkerchief be-
tween them, to which, be it the effect of cold or of
novelty, the two co-proprietors have frequent recourse.
Precisely as twelve o'clock strikes a certain movement
takes place in the hall, and three gentlemen, with not
too clean linen, members of the town-council, come
forward and take their places in the middle of the
platform, while a dozen fifes and trumpets execute a
flourish.
Now the operation begins. A little window in the
wheel on the right hand of the spectator is opened,
and charity-boy No. 1 is hoisted up to a level with
the opening; boy No. 2 stands a little lower; and a
dirty attendant proceeds to weigh, four at a time, two
in each scale, the covers or sheaths, at present empty,
in which shortly after are to be shut up the numbers.
These sheaths are shaped like large needle-cases, and
open and shut in the middle. As fast as each of
these is weighed, the dirty attendant passes it to
boy No. 2, who passes it in his turn to boy No. 1,
who throws it into the wheel. When the ninety
sheaths have been thus weighed and thrown in, the
little opening is previously closed, and the wheel turned

several times upon itself. Then it is opened again,
and boy No. 1 takes out of it, one by one, the little
cases, which he passes on in due succession to boy
No. 2, who hands them over to the dirty attendant,
who presents them to the gentleman on the left, who
gives them to the gentleman in the middle, in whose
hands they remain a little while. During this opera-
tion another unwashed, standing behind the gen-
tleman in the middle, exhibits to the public a little
square bit of dirty paper-everything and everybody
connected with the business is as dirty as possible-
and calls out with a loud voice the number engraved
upon it, and the name of a poor woman annexed to it,
as we have said. No. 1, Teresa Cornaro, daughter
of Paul; No. 2, Maria Bella, daughter of the late
Bartholomew;' and so on. As fast as the squares of
paper are shewn to the public, and the numbers there-
upon proclaimed, the attendant makes a little roll of
each that he hands to the gentleman in the middle, who
insinuates it into one of the sheaths which we have
already seen remain with him. These little cases are
shut one after another, and through the hands of the
gentleman on the right of the charity-boy No. 2 and
No. 1 of the second couple, each envelope now contain-
ing a number passes into the wheel hitherto unem-
ployed on the right hand of the spectator. At every
tenth number the wheel is shut and made to turn
rapidly round and round several times.
When the ninety numbers have been transferred to
the wheel on the right, the music strikes up again, the
charity-boy No. 1 is blindfolded, plunges his hand into
the wheel, draws from thence a sheath, which passing
from hand to hand is delivered to the gentleman in the
middle. He opens it, takes out the little roll, and gives
it to the attendant, who unfolds it, shews it to the
public, and proclaims with a loud voice the number
it contains; and so on five times following, with a
good fling of the wheel, and a flourish of the music
between each. The numbers thus drawn are received
with a murmur of approbation or with ironical cheers,
according as they are expected or not, popular or not:
for-where shall we not find popularity and unpopu-
larity? there are some numbers which are popular
and some which are not. Under the former head may
be ranged 5, 16, 32, 39, 48, 50, all double numbers, and
the whole series from 80 to 90. Why there should be
any preference in numbers it would not be easy to
tell. Gamblers are usually superstitious; and what
more likely than that those who habitually stake
money on hazard should come to associate luck with
certain numbers.
From time to time a rumour goes abroad that such
or such a person has the gift of second-sight with
respect to the numbers which are about to come. I
remember very well that, not many years ago, public
credulity had endowed a poor Capuchin friar with this
precious foresight, and the unfortunate man could not
appear in public without being beset by a crowd of
people, who asked him for numbers. The police were
obliged to interfere, and the poor prophet, I believe,
was ordered to change his residence.
We have seen how many minute precautions sur-
round the public drawing of the lottery, so as to remove
even the least possibility of fraud. In spite of this a
general popular notion prevails that the government
does not play fair; and whenever a certain number
which is expected does not come out, Caterina, my old
cook, will shake her head and say: 6 Such or such
number is too much played-an order is come from
Turin to strike it off the wheel;' or, Such another
number wont come out; they have put a leaden weight
to it, so that it must sink to the bottom of the wheel.'
What can one answer to this?
Caterina's all-absorbing interest in life has been for
fifty years, and still is, the lottery, in which she may be
said to live and move. Its abolition would prove her
death. She is an authority with all the maids and
milk-women of the quarter, and when she has said of
a number that it wont do, this number is condemned.
Caterina has an independent way of her own, and
so she rejects with scorn the commonplace doctrine
which makes of dreams the great and exclusive source
of divination. Dreams ought to be attended to, cer-
tainly, but at the proper time. She contends that for
those who have eyes to see, the occurrences of every-
day life may afford the widest, and at the same time
the safest ground for cabalistic speculation. On this
principle she acts, and is on the look-out from morning
to night. If a mason fall from a scaffolding, if a poor
fellow faint in the street, if a dog howl in a certain
way, if thunder roll, if the river overflow, if two
drunken soldiers set to quarrelling, if a funeral chance
to pass, if the chimney be on fire, if the neighbour be
brought to bed of twins-Caterina, like a new sort of
bee, draws from each of these events a honey sui
generis, which ends by crystallising into numbers.
Caterina goes out betimes, for meetings in the early
morning are the best. If the first person she sees is a
woman or a priest, it is a bad omen; if a chimney-
sweeper, a sign of luck; if a cat crosses the street, the
day will be fortunate. Every day, as sure as the day
comes, Caterina goes to hear mass in a church specially
dedicated to the souls in purgatory, and addresses to
them fervent prayers to send her good numbers.
Theirs, as it seems, is the lottery department in
yonder world. After this she begins her operations.
But to pick up a certain quantity of choice numbers
is not all: they must, moreover, be proved. It is in
this second stage of the business that the efficacious-
ness of dreams has been made evident. You prove
your numbers by putting them under your pillow when
you go to bed. Your dream, provided you know how
to interpret it properly, will tell you exactly whether
your note contain good numbers, and how many.
Generally speaking, to dream of silver, gold, or
diamonds, is unfavourable. To dream of rags or
rubbish is very good, but the best of all is to dream
of fire: wherever there is fire, there is sure winning.
Let me tell you as to this point a short anecdote, the
authenticity of which I can guarantee as an eye-wit-
ness. A lady dreams that her drawer was on fire.
Search is made, and an old lottery-ticket with three
numbers is found; these numbers are played, and all
come up. What say you?
Saturdays of course are days of great excitement
with Caterina, and the dinner had better look to itself.
If she does not win, which is often the case, it is some-
body's fault; her own fault sometimes, she allows it
freely and passionately. Fool that I was! to attend
to the milk-woman, and to put aside two numbers
of which I was sure! The souls in purgatory sent
them to me, bless them! But of what use was it?
I do not deserve to win. I will never put into the
lottery again!' You laugh at poor Caterina's infatua-
tion, and so do I. And yet Caterina has twice won a
terno, and with the produce thereof she has given a
marriage-portion to each of her two daughters.
It is naturally amid the poor and ignorant that the
lottery chiefly finds its votaries; yet there are excep-
tions to this rule. I have seen a young man of good
family, of the best education, and, I venture to say, of
superior attainments, prove in this respect as absurd as
Caterina, and fall a victim to his own folly.
He had obtained through the interest of his family a
situation of high trust and good pecuniary profit in a
public office, of which he was named cashier. The
chest was heaped full of gold, a small portion of which,
as he thought, would suffice to make his fortune.
Why not borrow it for a short time? The temptation
proved too strong. He borrowed, and borrowed, till at
the end of two years there was a deficit of L.20,000
sterling, which the lottery had swallowed up. As it

283
may be supposed, the young man did not go to the first
chance office to take his tickets for stakes of 10,000 or
20,000 francs at a time, which would have infallibly
brought about the discovery of his guilty practice. It
was in the hands of a friend, keeper of a lottery-office,
that he placed in private, and with the utmost secrecy,
the sums which he played, and this friend returned to
the young man in the strictest secrecy the ticket or
tickets containing the numbers taken, and setting forth
the sum staked upon them. Our gambler was in
despair. In a month he would be called upon for his
accounts, and it would be impossible to conceal further
the enormous deficit. What was to be done? Once
more he takes his chance in the lottery. This happened
before 1842, an epoch at which certain combinations of
the game which offered most temptation were abolished. |
One of the combinations then subsisting was to stake
upon a single number, fixing beforehand the place it
would hold in the series drawn-that is, that it would
come out first, second, third, and so on. This deter-
minate extract, as it was called, was paid seventy times
the amount staked. The young man staked upon
number seventy first drawn 10,000 francs (L.400 ster-
ling.) Seventy came first drawn. This was a prize of
700,000 francs (L.28,000 sterling.) Imagine the
raptures of our cashier. Not only had he wherewith
to fill up the deficit, but there remained an overplus of
clear gain 200,000 francs (L.8000.) He rushes to his
friend's house, but does not find him. He goes to seek
him at his lottery-office; he had not been seen there.
The cashier shews his winning-ticket; the head-clerk
turns to the register, and finds indeed the duplicate of
the winning-ticket-but, alas! instead of a stake of
10,000 francs there is one of ten francs upon it. The
false friend had thus appropriated to himself almost the
whole of the sums gambled by the cashier during the
two past years. The tickets which he used to give to
the unfortunate young man bore the whole figure meant
to be staked; but in the duplicate which remained
upon the register he used to mark merely some insig-
nificant amount, and of course pocketed the difference.
It is scarcely necessary to add that the faithless friend
did not reappear: he had run off to France. The
infatuated cashier had barely time to do the same, in
order to escape the terrible consequences of his breach
of trust, and died shortly afterwards in extreme
poverty. The incident will serve to remind readers
of various instances of defalcation in bankers' clerks
which came to light in England during the late railway
mania-a kind of gambling as injurious to society as
anything connected with the continental lotteries.
LONDON FROM THE VIADUCTS.
RAILWAYS have opened new prospects all over the
land: we no longer travel the old, familiar, hedge-
fringed highways, but flit through valleys, across
plains, and under hills before unvisited; and in most
cases, instead of dashing boldly into a town we pass
outside of it, oftentimes in a deep cutting, and never
know anything of its real chronic aspect unless we
stop and perambulate it for the special purpose. In
some instances, were it not for the name legibly
painted on the station-wall, you would not know that
you were stopping at a town at all; in others, such as
at Bath, you look up at the town, which rises hand-
somely above you as the train speeds by; or, as at
Edinburgh, where, from the bottom of the deep valley
which bisects the city, you get a glimpse of the huge
castle and the old town on one side, and of the new town,
with some of its monumental edifices, on the other.
Never was a city so well prepared to receive railways
as Edinburgh: the valley affords all needful entry and
exit without disturbing streets or houses.
But it is not always burrowing. At times the iron
road rises to a remarkable altitude, and we look down
on men and their ways and works with a glance often
more comprehensive than comfortable. What a fine
| bird's-eye view you get of Berwick while crossing the
lofty bridge over the Tweed, and of Newcastle while
traversing the Tyne-full of excitement and interest.
At Stockport, too, the viaduct is on a level with the
tops of the tall factory chimneys; and you are half
inclined, as the extraordinary spectacle presents itself,
to question the possibility of ever reaching the solid
earth again. There is scarcely a county that cannot
shew some similar railway phenomena-stand-points
for new prospects, as we said at starting, not unprofit-
able to contemplate: but we must confine our view
for the present to the banks of the Thames.
Five of the railways which have termini in the
metropolis make their approach on viaducts at several
points from the north-east round to the south and
south-west-precisely the directions which shew most
of the characteristics of a densely - crowded city.
Streets, lanes, alleys, and gardens are traversed by
the arched highway; and not a few of the mysteries
of London are revealed to the gaze of the inquisitive
traveller as he looks down from the train coming
grumbling in with slackened speed: he will see some
aspects of the great capital not perceptible to those
who pass along the ordinary level of the streets.
We have travelled on all these viaducts, greatly to
the increase and rectification of our topographical and
social knowledge. From the centre to the circum-
ference we have found something peculiar to each
point of the compass-each suburb has a character of
its own. At present we can only study them piece-
meal, by going from one terminus to another; but
some day, perhaps, we shall have a circular railway
all round London similar to that which is to engirdle
Paris, and then without leaving the carriage we shall
be able to contrast Belgravia and Paddingtonia with
Bethnal Green and Bermondsey-the sumptuous with
the squalid, splendid indolence with prosy industry.
A portion of the circle is already complete: from
Camden-Town to Fenchurch Street, passing close to
the Pentonville Prison, where unlovely' captives are
immured, skirting Islington and classic Highbury,
traversing insipid Kingsland, cutting Hackney in two,
touching Bow-the whole route a strange intermingling
of town and country until it joins and becomes part
of the Blackwall line at Stepney. You may travel
the whole nine miles for fourpence, with the comfort-
able assurance that the ride is well worth the money
whether you have business in hand or not.
Leaving town by the South-western line you first
get a view of the shabby-genteel, and altogether mean
district lying between Waterloo and Westminster
Bridges, including a peep at the New Cut in Lambeth,
a street always busiest on the Sunday. Here and
there are open squares surrounded by poor tenements;
and the whole space covered with broken crockery,
refuse vegetables, and dirty children. Next Vauxhall
Gardens are seen; and you are puzzled to know how
so dreary-looking a place should have gained an
Elysian reputation. Then come gasworks, foundries,
kilns, stoneware and whiting factories- the entire
suburb is filled with artisans of various grades--
Battersea Fields are beyond, and soon you are in the
green, glad country.
Go to Greenwich: immediately on leaving the ter-
minus at London Bridge you look down on tortuous,
unctuous, odorous Bermondsey. There is a powerful
smell from the tan-pits and the heaps of spent bark,
and the glue-factories, and the dyers and hatters,
tainting the atmosphere of an uninviting neighbour-
hood. There is a muddy creek led in from the river
after the Dutch fashion; there is another too: and there
is Jacob's Island-suggestive, besides its own especial
attributes, of Oliver Twist and Bill Sykes. A long
maze of masts marks the course of the Thames, and

fields beyond the smoke; yet he pauses not in his
labour, for his struggle to live is a desperate one.
The condition of too many of these households can only
be expressed by the term 'hugger-mugger: a few,
however, exhibit praiseworthy signs of an effort towards
amelioration-flowers in pots and boxes stand outside
the windows, and here and there a convolvulus or
nasturtium twines round a string stretched across the
panes, cheering, it may be hoped, the hearts of those
who tend them. Then there are numbers of bird-cages
hanging out, and you may hear the mellow notes of
the blackbird, the trill of the lark, or warble of the
goldfinch, and you will conclude that the people here-
abouts have a keen relish for the song of birds, or
are rare ornithologists. In truth they do know a
good deal about the qualities and habits of winged crea-
atures; and it is worth remembering that many of these
poor weavers are excellent mathematicians, and have
for many years constituted a mathematical society.
Blessed be that learning which thus dignifies and
lightens the humblest toil!
huge warehouses seem to be ever swallowing the
cargoes of ships; cranes creak, steam-engines clank,
trucks rattle, wagons rumble, as sugar, treacle, timber,
and other produce from the ends of the earth, are hoisted,
wheeled hither and thither, sold or stored. Presently
you are flying across Market-gardens: there lies Green-
wich, yonder New Cross, and London is left behind.
Turn into Fenchurch Street, and qualify yourself
for a ride to Blackwall: you mount a long flight of
steps, take your seat in a carriage, the train moves,
and Bermondsey with a difference is beneath you, not
quite so noisome in appearance, but with features in
common with the opposite shore. There is no mis-
taking the locality: you feel assured it must be near
the river, for you see stores of sails, ropes, masts,
booms, oars, and all sorts of ships' furniture, new,
second-hand, and worn out; and occasionally
wooden midshipman squinting through the sights of a
quadrant, perched on a bracket; or a flagstaff bearing
a bit of bunting rigged on a house-top to indicate
where nautical instruments are to be purchased. You
see boats at landing-places, and in yards in all stages of
efficiency and dilapidation, and are made aware of much
that is going on by senses other than that of sight;
for the noise of shipwrights' and calkers' hammers
comes to the car, and the scent of tar and fumes of
burning pitch to the olfactory nerves, in addition to the
constant odours of fish and mud. Low taverns there
are in number, with groups of grim sailors and noisy
coal-whippers lounging about them, and you hear
sounds of boisterous merriment or noisy quarrel.
Then come coal-yards and coal-docks, crammed with
ships and lighters, all as black as carboniferous dust
can make them; and presently the long ranges of the
West India Docks, with troops of labourers waiting to
be hired at the gates, and all the signs of a great and
active business going on; and soon afterwards the
bowsprits of tall ships appear above your head stretch-
ing far across the line-and before you have ceased to
wonder at the sights which have passed like a moving
panorama, the train stops at Blackwall.
There is another branch of ornithology studied in
this neighbourhood; you see which it is by the nume-
rous pigeon-coops and traps constructed of sticks and
wire on the house-top, with more or less of skill and
neatness. Always on the Sunday, and frequently
during the week, you may see the owner peeping from
a trap-door in the roof, or lolling against the chimney-
stack, and watching with keen though quiet eye his
flock of pigeons, as they tumble and wheel in circling
flight. If more than his number come home he is not
averse to the increase, for, unless sadly belied, many
of the owners are sharp practitioners, and cunning in
the inveiglement of columbiada. How the wary fellows
seem to enjoy themselves lounging there on the slope
of the roof in the warm sunshine!
You have scarcely had time to make observations
before you are past the dingy weaving district and the
headquarters of pigeon - fanciers, and enter what may
be called a miscellaneous neighbourhood. Rows of
pert, pretensious cottages are seen trying to look
Our journeyings have been most frequent on the genteel, though some of them are put out of counte-

proof of the assertion that to every bad there is a the roar and clatter of forty or fifty trains passing

appear in the narrow streets, the backs are still more of exasperation. In some instances an attempt is made
wretched. Forward there may be a sincere or spurious to convert the annoyance into a source of profit, by
attempt to look respectable, but rearward there is no enterprising publicans, who fit up the roof of their
hypocrisy, and you may seek behind each dwelling for house as an open-air drinking-stage, where drouthy

plexus of gloomy streets and alleys meets your eye, people, male and female, may often be seen on these
with tall old houses, cach storey lighted by a small-elevations, zealous in smoke and sonorous in song,
paned casement-window, running its whole length, and
many of them surmounted by a supplementary attic,
seemingly built of nothing but slate and glass, scarcely
less hot during the dog-days than 'under the leads' at
Venice. You cannot help commiserating the poor
silk-weavers who inhabit them. In some the looms
are seen vibrating briskly, in others languidly; and
from the alternate motions you may infer, if you will,
the character of those who produce them. The railway
is on a level with the roofs; hence you can see plainly
into the rooms, and look down the less aspiring
chimneys. It is easy to perceive that most of the
apartments serve for parlour, kitchen, and sleeping-
room as well as workshop; and while the husband plies
the shuttle, the wife may be seen cooking, washing,
mending stockings, or leaning out at the window with
three or four children clinging to her side, and others
crawling upon the floor. At times the weary weaver
himself turns his head as the train passes, with a wish
perhaps that he also were speeding away to green
particularly on Sunday evenings from six to ten.
There is always a difference in the view on Sundays:
tired labour lies longer abed, and blinds are kept down
and shutters closed until noon. Now and then you
may see a corner of a curtain raised as you dash past,
and a night - capped head gaze sleepily out, owl-like,
dazzled by the bright sunshine. But the curtain drops,
and the head goes back to its pillow, darkened chamber,
and stifling atmosphere. Tired labour does not always
take the best means of restoring itself, and clings with
fatal fondness to a morning of sleep and an afternoon
of jollity.
The plots of ground behind the houses seem to have
been parcelled out by a stingy hand, so diminutive do
they appear; but many of them are turned to good
account. Look at that coal-yard, scarcely twelve feet
square, and yet it ingests more tons of best Wallsend'
in a year, to egest them in quantities from ten pounds to
ten hundredweight, than would be credible by the
uninitiated. There, too, is a timber-yard of the like

dimensions, with stacks of deals, and ranges of boards,
planks, and scantling coaxed into a space that a villager
would consider hardly large enough for a pigsty.
Close by is a foundry, with a furnace in full blaze in
alarming proximity to the adjoining houses, whose
inmates have to put up' with the thumping of
hammers, the gasping of bellows, and annoyance of
flame and smoke, without hope of respite. These
vanish; and next you see the gardens of two rows of
'back-to-back' houses, all as green and lively as scarlet-
runners, hollyhocks, dahlias, and thickly - sown vege-
tables can make them. They form a little vista of
verdure, as welcome as the oasis in the desert. These,
however, are exceptions, for most of the plots shew
nothing but neglect in one place stands a pile of old
baskets; in another brickbats, wrecks of pots and pans,
a decaying crate, a dilapidated cask, or broken-down
cart; and the roofs of the little pantiled penthouses
behind each row of tenements are covered with similar
deformities. Why they are preserved is a mystery
which perhaps the owners themselves would be puzzled
to explain. Except as an atmospheric area the whole
of these miserable plots may be looked upon as wasted.
Yet among them are slips and angles of ground from
which the utmost benefit is exacted: here is just room
for a cart to stand shafts uppermost; there a truck lies
on its side in the smallest of nooks; yonder three cabs
are accommodated, but we have never yet seen how the
horses manage to squeeze by them to get to the stable.
In another queer-looking hole we saw the X-shaped
advertising vehicle which once went proudly through
the streets exhibiting the name of DÕUDNEY in all
the glory of ultramarine and gold. The glory had
departed capital letters no longer made its eight
surfaces eloquent, and it stood there idle and weather-
stained-a melancholy example of occupation gone.
taverns, appear in close proximity. Then there are
canals, roads, bridges, ponds, green and stagnant
ditches, coke-furnaces, windmills, gardens, brickyards,
meadows-where the sheep are blackened by London
smoke-potato-patches; all the phenomena, in fact,
of the debatable ground between urbs and rus, until,
having passed Stratford, you are in the broad, flat,
Dutch -looking meadows which stretch away with
little interruption to the fenny levels of Lincolnshire.
THE BUSHRANGERS.
CONCLUDING ARTICLE.
AFTER the extermination of Donoghue and his com-
panions, the good folks in the neighbourhood of the
Hunter River began to throw off together their fears
and precautionary measures, no doubt hopeful that the
sad end of these wretches would deter others from
entering on the same hazardous course of life. On this,
however, we reckoned prematurely; for in 1838 another
company of bushrangers, as daring and not less sangui-
nary, sprang up under the command of a man named
Davis, reputedly of Jewish origin; but as his visits
never extended to our neighbourhood, we trusted' to
escape being brought into contact with him or his party.
It is true we returned to our old safeguards: the doors
were kept locked, and barricaded at dusk; the arms
ready loaded and in good order; and there was always
a tendency on our parts to make for shelter on the
distant warning given us, by our dogs, of the approach
of horsemen.
In 1839 I was once more obliged to visit Sydney,
and, as formerly, business induced me to take a circui-
tous route homewards. I traversed nearly the same
road that had brought me into such a disagreeable
acquaintance with Donoghue; nor could I help

farther, and there are three or four families of coster- cedar seuchs past Yanamolong to the Valley of Wyong,

eating in their gardens, and drinking healths from five-obliged me with his hospitality. The morning after
or six doors off. Here and there are women washing
dishes, or the clothes of the household, while with
voluble tongue they strive to check the unruly propen-
sities of their children; and ever and anon you hear
cries and wailings, provoked by a hasty and angry slap.
Domestic life in public is not always an agreeable
subject of contemplation. Or another branch of in-
dustry appears: a cabinetmaker has brought his bench
out of doors, and is working busily, while the breeze
sweeps away his shavings, and perhaps imparts to him
a brief, unwonted vigour, which gladdens his over-
worked frame; for unless those three chiffonniers stand-
ing there in carcass' are finished by Saturday he will
not have wherewith to buy the Sunday dinner. Weary
work: week after week, and never a penny the richer!
There is a sound of many young voices: you look
and see a small play-ground, where some twenty or
thirty children are playing as only children can play;
as happy, apparently, in their limited territory as
though it were an Arkansas prairie. How they look
when summoned into school we have never yet had the
opportunity of witnessing.
These are but a few of the sights that present them-
selves from the viaduct; the variety and contrast are
scarcely to be classified or enumerated. Extremes
meet-pleasure-grounds and graveyards, churches and
my arrival all the establishment was in busy ply at
a very early hour; for on that day Mr Soling was to
have his annual cattle-marking-one of the most ani-
mating employments connected with the squatter's life.
As is usual on such occasions, a number of friends had
congregated to assist, and a scene of much excitement
prevailed. Some were in the stockyard busily throw-
ing the lasso and branding; others were outside, on
horseback, ever and anon giving chase to some fiery-
tempered bullock, that perhaps, having overturned two
or three sturdy stockmen, would dash through every
obstacle, and scour the well-cleared open space in front
of the station, his pursuers yelling, whooping, and crack-
ing their stock-whips in deafening uproar. Such
meetings were then indeed festive; the good things
of this life were in abundant supply, for settlers could
well afford them, such was the prosperous state of the
colony. About fourteen of us were thus merrily at
work, when, just as we were about to leave off for
breakfast, our party very unexpectedly received an
addition by the arrival of seven men, all heavily armed
-pistols in their belts and double-barrelled guns in
their hands-who galloped furiously up to the enclosure
the leader Davis, recognised by his Israelitish fea-
tures, calling out: Bale up this moment, or we'll fire
among you.' At the same time some of them rode to

the front of the house where Mrs Soling and female
friends were busily at work preparing for our bodily
wants; and a succession of screams from the inmates
assured us the unfortunate ladies were also baled up.'
The notification produced the same effects on all our
party-stupid, staring fright. Mr Soling tried to
stammer out something, but Davis cut him short with
a blasphemous oath, letting him know, that if any
person attempted to use force, or to leave the stock-
yard, not one should be spared; that by remaining
quiet, he might be content with a part of the money and
arms in the house.'

I was indebted to Master Buka, who, fearful of being
separated from me, had informed the party that his
master, Mr, 'Murry strike-a-light that place.' At
first the festivity was confined to deep potations; but
as the excitement increased all prudential considera-
tions were laid aside, and loud, boisterous singing
followed; in which I could recognise the name of that
incarnate villain, Donoghue, often mentioned, as the
chorus ran much in the following strain :-
"
Oh, himself was a man bold and true,
And never knuckled under-the Bold Donoghue.'
The evening was far advanced when Davis, whose
authority over his drunken companions was wonder-
ful, obliged the party to break up, by removing and
fastening to his saddle (his pillow) the two remaining
small kegs of spirits; after which Buka and myself
were firmly pinioned and secured to trees, at a distance
from each other. This done, and the watch set, the
sonorous nasal breathing of all save the look-out soon
shewed that Bacchus and tobacco had done their work
very effectually. Nor was the man appointed to
keep watch long in following the example: first a
nod-then a little struggle to keep awake-then a nod;
and he too was soundly in the embrace of Morpheus.
The constrained position in which I had been left
bound prevented entirely the possibility of sleep;
although 'nature's sweet restorer' oft invited my
tired-out energies, but in vain. There I lay, crippled
up much after the manner of the delinquents in the old
pictures of the Inquisition; gazing wistfully at the
stars as they sent their mild rays peeringly through
the foliage of the splendid eucalyptus which towered
over the bandit party.
Any other course than that of passive obedience was
out of the question: here we were fairly at his mercy;
as never anticipating such a possibility, the arms were
all inside. Those who were on horseback were ordered
to dismount, and marched into the stockyard-a large
enclosure made with rough branches of trees-where we
had to remain, while Davis and some of his companions
went into the dwelling and rummaged, taking the arms,
money, and everything else disposable. They then
made a hurried repast on the viands prepared for our use;
and drinking long and deep draughts to our success in
cattle-marking, came outside and mounted, not, how-
ever, before they had exchanged some of the best of our
horses for their own, which were not so good as bush-
rangers usually then rode-the choice of horse-flesh
being one of their many assumed privileges. On taking
his departure, Davis called out to Buka to mount and
follow the party; also to bring with him some of the
rope and hide cuttings we had been using to throw the
cattle with. My valued servant prepared to obey with
a look which the bushranger not unjustly construed
into unwillingness, and giving him a lash with a stock-
whip, which made him jump higher than if he had been
enacting the most vigorous of the wild corrobory-dances
of the country, the party cantered off. It was with no
little pleasure we saw them turn the corner of the wood
to the left. Thank Heaven, they're off at last!'
burst simultaneously from every one of us; such was
the dread which these ruffians inspired, known as they
were to be guilty of shooting their victims sometimes
out of mere wantonness when excited by drinking. Our
gratulations were in this case premature; for just as we
were about to leave the stockyard, two of the brigands
came galloping back to say that the captain had sent
them for Mr F- My feelings, as may be supposed,
were not the most enviable at this moment.
The ex-
citement of the last two hours had certainly prepared
me for almost any termination to the events passing
around me, but could not reconcile me to being thus
singled out. Bidding adieu to my friends, I mounted
and followed my impatient warders, who shewed by
the expert and rapid manner in which they rode
through the dense forest, that they were accustomed to
make hurried marches across the country. As we can-bably not being encumbered with timekeepers, availed
tered along, I essayed in vain to learn why Davis required
my company. The only reply to my anxious inquiries
was, that the captain had found out I knew the line
of country he wished to traverse, and if I conducted
myself to his satisfaction it would be well for me.'
The squatter's life soon accustoms those who are
engaged in it to all sorts of vicissitudes; and 'roughing
it' in the bush, without bed or blanket, was what I
should have cared little about, had I not been placed
in my present painfully-constrained position. Nothing,
however, now remained for me but to wait quietly for
morning, listening to the shrill cry of the large night-
jay, or watching the sly opossums and the more agile
flying sugar-squirrels, as they performed all sorts of
antics in the branches of the weeping mimosas which
enclosed our little encampment.
It was indeed a relief to me when the 'settlers' clock,'
or laughing jackass--a sort of large gray kingfisher-
gave indications, by its loud peculiar cry, of the ap-
proach of day; and as if accustomed to its alarum, all
the party jumped up simultaneously, rubbing their
eyes to remove the impressions of the past night's
debauch-Davis ordering them to shake the grog out
of their heads. We should not omit to mention that
the bird just referred to was called the 'settlers' clock'
by the primitive founders of the settlement, who, pro-
themselves of its early propensities to call their assigned
convict servants to labour. Most of the precious gang
in whose hands I now was had been assigned convict
labourers, and had no doubt been habituated to rise at
the peculiar sound of this sylvan clock.
After a very hurried breakfast, we were again on
the move to the north, passing, one after another, the
high rough ridges of the Blue Mountains-not by any
means an easy task, as our route lay through a forest
probably untrodden hitherto by the foot of the white
man.
On joining the band we all struck off to the left, and
instead of keeping near the main road passed through a
cedar seuch, interspersed with the bangolas, or wavy
palms, where the only marks were those of wild
cattle. About seven we halted, when an abundant
supply of provisions and spirituous liquors were pro-
As we rode cautiously along, Davis repeatedly

was there any spot where such was practicable without
making a long detour. The object of bringing the
ropes, hide-strippings, &c. was now manifest; for one
after another, the horses were led to the brink, and the
saddles removed. The poor brutes were then slung
and suddenly pushed off the edge by four of the party,
while the others eased down the ropes, which were
passed round a tree. To accomplish this they were
obliged to unfasten the stirrup-irons and add the
leathers, the ropes not being sufficiently long. With
some difficulty, and not without many bruises from
their kicking and plunging, the poor horses were all
landed safely below; after which we descended, Buka
being the last to do so-the captain remarking, 'that as
he was a black devil, nothing would break his neck.'
After this we ascended another high portion of the
Blue Mountain, when I guessed the reason of our late
proceedings, as I recognised by the nature of the
country in the distance, over which the sun was setting,
that Scone was not many leagues off, and that, regard-
less of the usual safe routes, Davis had adopted a plan
very common with bushrangers of cutting across
country.' Our ringleader now became more than
ever inquisitive about the different establishments in
the neighbourhood, to which he was obviously bent
on a visit; and at every faltering reply he quietly
cocked a large pistol, as much as to intimate that I
should receive its contents if I hesitated to give true
information.
Shortly after sunset we halted for the night; and
again the scenes of drunken revelry were enacted, but
with somewhat more caution, as no singing was allowed
-although in this respect it required all Davis's
firmness to keep his men in order. As soon as all
the eatables and drinkables were consumed, Buka and
myself were again secured for the night, and the party
soon lay stretched around in strange confusion, forming
a group which would have delighted a Salvator Rosa.
Sleep was not long in visiting my companions-even
the watchman; for he, too, after vainly attempting to
keep his eyes open, soon joined the loud chorus of
stertorous sleepers. Thoroughly worn out, I felt every
inclination to follow their example, but, doubly pinioned,
it was impossible; so I amused myself once more by
watching the agile opossums chasing one another from
branch to branch, or the flying squirrels gliding from
tree to tree by means of their broad lateral mem-
branes, and in longing for the morning dawn, and
revolving in my mind whether escape was altogether
impossible.
My chief trust had always been in Master Buka,
who I knew would, if possible, concoct some scheme to
liberate me.
As to attempting to escape with my arms
secured as they were, it was quite out of the question;
for I could neither mount a horse, nor direct his move-
ments if mounted. Of all the singular beings I have
met in my travels-and they are not few-certainly the
aborigines of New Holland are the most remarkable-
remarkable, I should say, for all want of moral charac-
teristics: even their sagacity-the highest feature-
partakes of the instinct of the lower animals more than
the reasoning of the human species. Indolent to a
degree scarcely to be credited, they despise any sort of
continuous labour, and prefer the uncertain subsistence
of an occasional hunt; and so improvident are they in
regard to food, thus or in any other way acquired, that
they will throw away what remains after their imme-
diate wants are supplied, rather than be at the trouble
of carrying it with them. As a proof of their general
improvidence, we may state that on one occasion we
saw several of a tribe clothed in European attire by
some kind people, and within a week scarcely a rag
was to be found among them: some articles having
been disposed of for grog, and others thrown away
because the weather was hot, or because it was too
troublesome to wear them. They seem to have scarcely
any idea of a future state, and they regard death with
aversion, chiefly because it removes them from the
gratification of the animal passions. But with all their
stupid indifference they possess much strategy, and
scarcely any emergency can arise in which they will
not devise some method of escape. Gratitude or any
other exalted feeling they cannot be said to have, for
they receive with apathy anything that is given to or
done for them; yet if once attached to a European,
they will not readily desert him: on the contrary, they
will sometimes, when least expected, shew a desire to
serve him, especially if in any dilemma connected with
bush-life, and in which they are quite at home.
I was not disappointed on this occasion; for after
passing two very miserable hours, I thought I could
discern a figure hovering about for a second or two,
like an evil spirit, over each of my companions, and
approaching me, whispered: 'Bale, you get jerrend;
me mill-mill all them warragals asleep;' in other words
-'Don't be afraid; I find all around us asleep.' He
then asked for a knife, which I remembered was in my
waistcoat-pocket; but how was it to be got at, firmly
pinioned as we both were with our hands behind? The
wily native, however, knelt down and applied his mouth
in such a way as to work it out, and then opened it;
which done, he contrived to cut the cords that secured
my wrists, now much swollen and almost devoid of
feeling. As soon as his own hands were free we moved
off stealthily to where the horses were tethered. It
was too dark to distinguish one from another, nor was
it at the moment a matter of much consideration.
Fortunately the bridles had been knotted and thrown
over the necks of the animals, so we were not long in
getting two moved away. It is very probable we might
have gone back without much risk to look for saddles ;
so completely were all the party under the influence
of the evening's debauch, that even the trampling of
the horses as we led them off did not awake them.
Buka took the lead, and we pushed along as fast as the
dim light and the nature of the woods permitted, every
step which we took increasing our distance from our
late companions, and adding to our thankfulness.
As soon as daylight broke upon us Buka recog-
nised that we were not far from Invermein, although
quite out of the proper road. The last two days' ride,
however, had shewn us that with determination
almost any part of the country might be travelled; so
making our way over the intervening irregular ridges,
we reached Invermein by nine o'clock. No time
was lost in communicating to the good folks the
probability that their township might be visited by
the party we had escaped from, and instant pre-
paration was made; but as to going on with me to
Scone to assist, that was declined on all sides. We
were reluctantly furnished with saddles and fresh
horses, and immediately set out for Scone, hoping, by
giving timely notice, to avert the attack of the bush-
rangers. On reaching the little township I found all
the houses shut up; and on knocking at the door of an
acquaintance, was surprised to hear loud shrieks, but
on making myself known, was admitted. The first
question was: Oh, Mr did you meet them?
They have been here, and murdered young Graham at
Mr Dangar's store.' As soon as the confidence of a
few was restored, we went down to the scene of the
late murderous robbery, and found poor Graham lying
in the enclosure behind the house quite dead, in
a pool of his own blood. From a youth who had been
secreted in the store we learned the particulars, that
when the bushrangers came to the house and ordered
the inmates to 'bale up,' Graham presented a pistol,
which missed fire, and a second one went off, but
without taking effect, on which he attempted to escape
by the back-door to alarm the neighbours; but Davis
followed and killed him, by discharging a double-
barrelled gun, while the victim was on his knees

imploring mercy. Information of the occurrence
was soon transmitted to Maitland; and Mr Day, a
most energetic magistrate, lost no time in calling out
a strong body of assigned servants, to whom a promise
was given, that if they used proper exertions to capture
this band of ruffians, they would be recommended for
pardon-a measure which was often found of import-
ance at that time, as with such stimulus before them
they were more reckless of consequences than volun-
teer free persons, who had little but the honour or
excitement to set off against the almost certainty of
being wounded or killed in an encounter with the
bushrangers. Mr Day tracked them from place
to place, and at last came upon them encamped in
Doboy's Hollow, between Scone and the Hunter's
River; and so unprepared were they, that after a few
ineffective shots, all surrendered-Davis observing, as
they were seizing him in Mr Day's presence: Ah, Mr
Day, if there were but a few more magistrates as active
as you are, there would be no bushrangers.' All this
detestable gang were soon after executed at Sydney,
and since that people have been able to traverse the
colony in all directions without danger of being robbed
or murdered a state of security which we believe will
continue even should transportation to New South
Wales be renewed; for we cannot but hope, that if our
government does resume it in that colony, they will
see the propriety of following out the ticket-of-leave
system, by which the unfortunate exile has an interest
in his labour, and a stimulus to use his best endeavours
to regain his lost position in society.
THE RAGGED SCHOOL EMIGRANTS.
Since the autumn of 1848 upwards of three hundred
youths have emigrated from the London Ragged Schools
to Australia and America. We take a low estimate
when we suppose that two hundred and fifty of those
youths are doing well, and have proved themselves worthy
of the confidence of their teachers and the assistance of
their friends. Now, if such is the case, we maintain that
the reclamation of that number-even if the remainder
had fallen away, which we are by no means disposed to
admit is more than a compensation for all the money
expended on emigration purposes, and the education of
those who have shared its benefits. The average age of
the emigrants is sixteen. Let us suppose they had been
left another sixteen years, the subjects of ignorance and
neglect. Doubtless fifty, at least, would have been trans-
ported; and several convictions, imprisonments, and ulti-
mate transportation, would be economically managed in
each case at L.200. Here we have an expense to the
country of L.10,000, and our colonists again visited with
the terrible infliction of another fifty ignorant and brutified
miscreants, of whom the mother country had become
wearied. Nor is this all; for, at a low estimate, twenty-five
of these convicts would have become fathers prior to their
expulsion; and thus we should not only have had twenty-
five destitute mothers, paupers in the workhouse or
systematic beggars in the streets, but also, at the least
another fifty hungry, ragged, destitute children in a con-
dition even worse than were their fathers, and obliged to
follow in their very footsteps. Add to this the amount
of moral evil-that no human gauge can measure-which
these fifty victims of ignorance and neglect must for
several years have been propagating.-Ragged School
Union Magazine.
MANNERS OF THE COAL DISTRICTS.
In the northern coal-fields, near Newcastle-on-Tyne
especially, we have noticed that when the miner ascends
from the pit in the evening, his first care is to wash himself
from head to foot, and then to put on a clean suit of white
flannel. As you pass along the one street of a pitman's
village you will see the father reading a Chambers's
Journal,' or a cheap religious magazine, at the door of his
cottage, while smoking a pipe, and nursing a child or two
on his knee; and through the open door a neat four-post
bed, and an oak or mahogany chest of drawers, bear witness
•
to his frugality. In Wednesbury, Bilston, and all that
district, when work is over, you find the men drinking in
their dirty clothes and with grimy faces at the beer-shop
of the Buttcy'-that is to say, the contractor or middle-
man under whom they work-according to the system of the
country, and the women hanging about the doors of their
dingy dwellings gossipping or quarrelling-the old furies
and the young slatterns.-Sidney's Rides on Railways.

HEALTHFULNESS OF HOPS.
The following observations, in a work by Dr Wardrop
attention: Animals as well as man are instinctively
'Diseases of the Heart,' are exceedingly worthy of
impelled to eat substances when they are out of health,
in order to assist the digestion of the food; and no cattle
will thrive upon grasses which do not contain a portion
of bitter extractive. Even the inhalation of the odour
from the flowers of the hop has an extraordinary beneficial
effect upon the sick; and in Kent, where it is extensively
cultivated, those employed in collecting the flowers are so
greatly improved in their health, that many persons who
are enfeebled quit the metropolis to pick hops,' and
return to their homes with their appetite and strength
materially improved.' If such really be the case, as this
respectable authority reports, cottagers and others might
be recommended to grow a few hop-plants outside their
doors and windows, with a view to improving health. The
hop is a beautiful climbing plant, and on that account
alone it forms an agreeable shrub for the window.

THE HEROINE MARTYR OF MONTEREY.
BY THE REV. JAMES GILBORNE LYONS, LL.D.
When the American forces under General Taylor stormed
Monterey, on the 21st, 22d, and 23d of September 1846, a Mexican
woman was seen going about among the disabled of both armies,
binding up their wounds, and supplying them with food and water.
While thus employed she fell. She was on the following day buried
by the Americans, who had even then to bear an incessant dis-
charge of shot from the Mexican batteries.
THE strife was stern at Monterey,
When those high towers were lost and won;
And, pealing through that mortal fray,
Flash'd the strong battery's vengeful gun:
Yet, heedless of its deadly rain,
She stood in toil and danger first,
To bind the bleeding soldier's vein,
And slake the dying soldier's thirst.
She found a pale and stricken foe
Sinking in nature's last eclipse,
And on the red earth kneeling low,
She wet his parched and fevered lips:
When, thick as winter's driving sleet,
The booming shot and flaming shell
Swept with wild rage that gory street,
And she-the good and gentle-fell!
They laid her in a narrow bed-
The foemen of her land and race;
And sighs were breathed, and tears were shed,
Above that lowly resting-place.
Ay ! glory's crimson worshippers
Wept over her untimely fall,
For deeds of mercy such as hers
Subdue the hearts and eyes of all.
To sound her worth were guilt and shame
In us, who love but gold and ease:
They heed alike our praise or blame,
Who live and die in works like these.
Far greater than the wise or brave,
Far happier than the fair and gay,
Was she, who found a martyr's grave
On that red field of Monterey !

CONFESSIONS OF A SAFE PERSON.
It is a generally received opinion that the greater
part of the minor miseries of human life usually arise,
either nearly or remotely, from our own faults, follies,
or misdemeanours. Now, without having any intention
of attempting to controvert this impression as a general
rule, I cannot help thinking that it admits of many and
great qualifications in its various bearings. I know not
how it may fare with others, but I think I may venture
to affirm, on my own behalf, that all my delinquencies
put together have not entailed upon me so plentiful a
harvest of bitter fruit as the possession of one inconve-
nient characteristic that may almost be regarded as a
virtue—namely, that of being a thoroughly safe person.
How this peculiarity of temperament evinces itself I
am rather at a loss to describe: I fancy, however, that
it must lie rather conspicuously on the surface, or I
should not so frequently have to lament its possession.
If this very inconvenient endowment were known
only to the friends of my youth, or even those of long-
standing, who had watched the gradual growth of my
character and mind, it would be of little consequence,
but it appears equally obvious to the casual acquaint-
ance of yesterday; and no individual of them all, as
it seems to me, ever becomes the recipient of a dis-
agreeable of any kind, but he or she hastens without
remorse to deposit the unwelcome burden upon me,
as though I were a feminine Atlas of old, strong
enough to bear the woes of the world, instead of a
fragile widow lady, needing support for myself. Per-
haps it may be that, as I am well known to have
graduated in the school of sorrow without having made
any violent demands on the sympathy of others, I may
be supposed to possess some unknown and specific
consolation which might be equally efficacious with all
who have sufficient confidence to seek it at my hands.
Whether I am quite correct in this surmise I know
not; but I do know that it is very disheartening to one
willing to bear unshrinkingly her own share of the
cares of humanity, to be called upon to sustain all the
troubles, real and imaginary, of a rather extensive
circle of acquaintance.
Thus it is, however; and so numerous have my
clients of this kind become, that I could divide them
into almost as many classes as those of the Swedish
naturalist himself. For the present I pass entirely
over claimants for consolation under those real evils
of life in which we are in a manner bound to sympa-
thise with each other. To bear each other's burdens
is a great duty, and I trust I am not unwilling to take
my share in exemplifying it. But what I do deprecate
and protest against is the wearisome detail of those
PRICE 14d.
mean and petty cares which people too often create
for themselves, and which to them
'Make up in number what they want in weight.'
My claimants for consolation under this head are, I
regret to say, neither few nor unimportunate; nay,
many of them are accustomed, as a matter of course,
on the occurrence of the slightest untoward event, to
bring their budget of grievances and unlade them at
my door. It is vain to look, if not to say, that nothing
of the kind is wanted; they persist in unpacking and
spreading out their wares before me, obtruding them
for inspection en gros et en detail, until finding escape
impossible, I proceed to examine as the best means of
getting rid of them. I separate the real from the
imaginary, and finally suggest such expedients and
alleviations as may occur to me at the time. Having
done all this, I naturally congratulate myself on my
approaching release from their importunitics; but the
result too often proves my joy to have been premature.
These dealers in distress are by no means disposed
to part with their stock in trade without some better
equivalent than an exhortation to patience, or an
assurance that others are as highly taxed and as
heavily laden as themselves.
Another variety of my visitants are in the habit of
endowing me with a vast amount of important secrets,
which I neither desire nor deserve; but escape is of no
easy attainment, for in all probability I meet them the
next day in the public thoroughfare as facts well known
to every one but myself. I am entirely at a loss to
understand how such important nothings could have
transpired, until I recollect that some persons covet
secrets as a spendthrift does money-for the express
purpose of circulation.
But it is time to descend from generalities to parti-
culars. One old friend of mine fulfils for me the office
of a legal almanac, acquainting me, by the length and
frequency of his visits, when term-time commences and
terminates. He has for some years been in the habit
of requiring me to accompany him through all the
windings of an intricate and protracted Chancery suit;
from the first cruel injustice' which necessitated the
litigation through the first filing of the bill, the cross-
bill by which it was met, the answer, the interlocutory
hearing, reference to the master, judgment, appeal, and
da capo before the lord chancellor-not a single phase
of its tediousness will he abate me. He even offered to
send me the pleadings home, to satisfy me of the justice
of his claim-a fact which I had never for one moment
doubted. I did not, however, avail myself of his offer,
particularly as I had travelled over the ground again
and again; nay, arrived, as I flattered myself, within

sight of the decision-extinction, I was going to say;
but who ever witnessed the actual death of a suit in
Chancery? No; it is the very phoenix of litigation,
and in its apparent demise leaves behind it the cle-
ments of a new and more vigorous successor to supply
its place-
'E'en in its ashes live its wonted fires.'
a reluctant assent, but was evidently too little informed
of the mental food most attractive to boys of twelve
years old to derive all the consolation which this view
of the subject was calculated to present.
fidences by which I am honoured are not of so serious
In common honesty, I must admit that all the con-
a class as those above mentioned. For instance, love-
affairs, to which I am far less averse, are on the whole
very endurable; for though they may be rather volu-
minous, there is something not actually disagreeable
in finding yourself the depositary of hopes bright as
sunshine and transparent as truth itself: I must own,
however, I like the revelations to be direct and from
the principals in the affair, and utterly repudiate all
second-hand communications. It is true I have often
to bear witness to the verity of Shakspeare's opinion
about 'true love never,' &c.; but then, as Juliet says,
"Tis such sweet sorrow,' that I can hardly help
prophesying smooth things, and cherishing the hope
that all will come right in the end. And then how
pleasant is it to hear that the hero or heroine, as
the case may be, always admired us so much as
a Safe Person,' and 'had so high an opinion of our
influence and powers of persuasion.'
One young
gentleman, in the fervour of his gratitude for a suc-
cessful negotiation with a rather refractory grand-
mother, went so far as to say, that he thought,
'when I was young!' I must have borne a striking
likeness to dear Gertrude in person and character.
Was not this ample reward for the sour looks and
short answers that I had encountered on his behalf?
fidences of this description have not been without their
cares and anxieties. One desperate case, I remember,
caused me two or three sleepless nights, for the parties
seemed rather too familiar with the exact point at
which England ends and Scotland begins; and even the
lady dropped some hints that the penalty of exclusion
from Her Majesty's drawing-room might be endured. I
confess I did not like all this; but happily papa's bless-
ing and the bishop's licence relieved me of all trouble
in the event. I cannot deny that I have witnessed the
death as well as the birth of more than one eternal
attachment; but such events have not shaken my faith
in constancy, or led me to concur with Dr Johnson in
his opinion, that marriages would be as happy if made
by the lord chancellor.
Such being the case, should the antiquated cause in
question ever give up the ghost, I should speedily be
called upon to sympathise in another troubled joy of
the same nature; my worthy friend being of a consti-
tution that is never quite at ease except when under
the influence of a blister of one description or another.
Another old friend, of ancient lineage and somewhat
Puritanical views, took advantage of a morning-call to
pour into my sympathising ear his fears that his eldest
son Augustus must have been getting over head-and-
cars in debt, for he had, by mistake, opened a letter
from which the word junior had been inadvertently
omitted, which proved to be a bill for cigars of L.13,
3s. 6d.; and as vexations never come singly, another
letter had arrived by the same post to himself, from
the young gentleman's tailor, enclosing a little account
of L.48, 17s. 10d., and soliciting his intervention with
a view to its early settlement, having a large remit-
tance to make up, &c. As the anxious father made
this communication, he drew forth the missive in ques-
tion, as though ill-news ever needed confirmation, or II must, however, admit that one or two of my con-
were a person to require vouchers! I can truly say
that I fully shared in the vexation of my friend, for the
young man had always been rather a favourite of my
own. I had often thought how much credit he reflected
on his tailor, and was therefore proportionably disap-
pointed to learn that the 'credit' appeared rather to lie
on the other side. However, I fully concurred in the
propriety of a strong remonstrance being despatched
forthwith; to do which, before he cooled, my old
friend shortly retired to his study, leaving his wife and
myself to talk the matter over, and consult on the best
means of arresting the evil. After a sufficient time
had been devoted to lamentations, &c. I ventured to
suggest that the strong remonstrance should be fol-
lowed, at a convenient distance, by a cheque; hinting
that I had known a free pardon of a first offence very
effective in preventing the recurrence of a second-
nipping, in fact, the evil in the bud.
No sooner had we settled this difficulty-so far as
agreement on our own parts could do so-than the
good lady hastened to inform me that she was not
without her own peculiar trial as it regarded her
youngest son Horace (whom she was educating at
home under her own eye), although she had not at
present communicated the circumstance to his father.
Though I am by no means an advocate, in general, for
conjugal concealments, I thought in the present case a
degree of reserve might be commendable, even before
I was aware that the cause for anxiety arose from
no more important fact than that she had, on several
occasions, latterly, detected the young gentleman in
the perusal of the Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,' on
church festivals, although she had expressly pro-
vided the 'Life of Henry Milner,' by Mrs Sherwood,
for such recreation! At this announcement she looked
steadily into my face for some answering sign of sur-
prise and sympathy. But as the offence in question
did not appear to me to be of so very deep a dye, I
thought myself justified in reminding her, in extenua-
tion of the delinquency of my young friend, that the
obnoxious work was by no means an objectionable one,
in time and place, and that it might have been a
much worse book that had seduced the lad from
his duty.
To this suggestion she returned rather
6
I cer-
I do not profess to be equally tolerant of the com-
munications from the heads of houses; such persons
being usually less ethereal in their requirements, and
by no means equally refined in their general views.
One lady, the wife of a military man, for instance,
walked two miles to inform me that she fully believed
her daughter Georgiana would sacrifice herself to young
Sylvester, who had not joined' more than a twelve-
month, and who did not possess a guinea to buy himself
up; and she fully believed the silly girl was even
prepared for his sake to throw over' their old friend
Colonel Cannon, who was about to retire on full-pay,
with the good-service pension' in prospect.
tainly did not much wonder that Ensign Lackland,
with his handsome face and gallant bearing, should
present greater attractions to the eyes of nineteen than
the gallant colonel, with double the amount of years
and of wisdom; but the idea of throwing over' a
gentleman of such weight and magnitude presented so
ludicrous an image to my mind, that I could not resist
a smile, which, unfortunately, did not pass unnoticed,
and being misinterpreted, was resented accordingly. I
was reminded that, however improbable such events
might appear to some persons, inore unlikely unions
were of frequent occurrence; and she had reason for
believing that the colonel only awaited a little encou-
ragement to declare his sentiments. In confirmation
of this view she instanced the fact that, at the com-
mandant's ball only a week before, he had been heard

to remark that Georgiana was almost as pretty as her
mother had been at her age;' which led some persons to
think that old wounds might be scarred over. However
that might be, she had determined to probe the affair
as regarded Mr Sylvester to the bottom. As she was
so determined, I had no alternative but to defer at
once to her superior judgment and experience. I had,
besides, a special repugnance to any conversation
reminding me of surgical operations, ever since I had
accompanied the said Georgiana to have a tooth
extracted; to spare the poor girl a lecture from mamma,
by the way, on the ease with which such operations
were performed in the present day, and the courage
which she herself had always manifested on similar
occasions.
6
Of the general history of servants, as well as of their
individual errors and omissions, I think I may venture
to say that I am an animated encyclopædia, although I
made for a long time a steady and vigorous resistance;
but what can a single defender do against a host of
assailants? I was obliged finally to capitulate, and
abandon my position with as good a grace as possible.
The venerable Archdeacon Paley, if I mistake not,
observes in one of his admirable works, that the
general lot of humanity, however dark it may appear,
will on examination be usually found to contain its own
peculiar compensations.' And I have learned to be of
the same opinion; for no sooner did I look this infliction
steadily in the face than I discerned many alleviations
in its unpromising physiognomy that had not presented
themselves before, in the opportunities it afforded me
of offering suggestions of a palliative character for
those who are seldom permitted an opportunity of
saying much for themselves.
My general acquaintance with human nature has led
me to believe that a certain peculiarity of temperament
is very likely to be accompanied by a certain style of
error and misdemeanour; hence when any general
complaints are made of the shortcomings of Jane or
Susan, I have only to put a few leading queries, with
the view of ascertaining to which class the sanguine
or lymphatic-the offender belongs, and I am forthwith
prepared to offer some suggestions of a consolatory
character. If, for instance, the delinquent be of the
sanguine temperament-rather given to short answers
to her lady and long questions to the policeman; though
I am fully prepared to believe that she may be a little
too coquettish in her attire as well as in her temper;
rather addicted to followers perhaps; with a certain
familiarity of smile when she is pleased, and toss of the
head, by way of defiance, when she is affronted: still, in
such cases I have usually found it safe to suggest how
swift-footed she is in general-how ready and intelligent
on emergencies-how willing, with a little bribe of praise,
to take upon herself duties not exactly her own-with a
concluding remark on the credit a house derives from
having a trim damsel to open the door in the absence
of the footman.
If, on the contrary, the subject be of the lymphatic
class-given to late hours in the morning and dowdiness
throughout the day-such unpromising representations
by no means discourage me; for even inertness may
have its compensation. In such cases your corre-
spondence is pretty sure of remaining intact; china and
glass pass scathless through her hands; and thus, as
Dr Kitchener profoundly remarks, fragile wares may
be made to last as long as iron.' The baker seldom
receives encouragement to linger long with his basket;
she does not seek to rival her young lady by clumsy
imitations of her Parisian bonnet or Polish Kesiewick;
nor is she apt to strike your piano dumb in your
absence by any practisings of her own.
•
Now, although these qualities are of rather a negative
character, they are very important in their way, and
I have seldom found my observations without effect.
Once, indeed, I confess myself to have been completely
at fault; for the delinquent brought to the bar of
justice was said to unite in her own proper person all
the faults common to both classes. In vain I taxed
both memory and imagination to meet the exigencies of
the case, but without effect. At length, wearied of the
subject, I proceeded to dismiss it by what I thought an
unanswerable proposition—namely, ' that we must not
expect perfection for twelve pounds a year;' but my
antagonist was 'too cunning at fence' for me, and
even foiled me with my own weapons, by triumphantly
exclaiming: True, my dear; but I give guineas!' I
need hardly say that after this I never attempted to
lead a forlorn-hope again.
Though the history I have given, for obvious reasons,
can hardly be considered a complete specimen of the
confidences with which I am honoured, as regards the
more exclusive class of my visitors, it may perhaps be
received as a sample of the more general and common-
place description of revelations that come before me.
'Give sorrow words,' said the poet who best knew
human nature in all its phases. To thousands of
persons verbal sympathy does seem to possess an incal-
culable charm; and although we may question the
intensity of the grief that can be so easily medicined,
it is equally certain that that is trouble which is felt
as such, whether it be the loss of a kingdom or the loss
of a pencil-case.
I once inquired of a friend who was habitually
reserved what could have induced her to make a con-
fidante of myself in a matter of some delicacy: she was
silent for a moment, as though revolving the subject in
her mind, and then replied that she thought it arose
from the entire absence of curiosity on my own part-
a sort of indifference, not to say repugnance, to the

THE BATHURST DIGGING S.
THE discovery of gold in the Bathurst District in New
South Wales has taken the world by surprise-a new
California in one of our own colonies! The whole of
Australia, however, has long been known to be par-
ticularly rich in metallic minerals. Copper is begun
to be wrought in various places with a success that
has already made several fortunes; lead has also been
discovered; and an iron mine was recently opened in
the neighbourhood of Berrima, where an abundant
supply of ore is found almost on the surface, said to
yield 65 to 70 per cent. of metal of the finest quality.
Coal is found in abundance. In short, skill, capital,
and hands are alone required to excavate immense
mineral riches; and that these requisites will in due
time be provided, nobody can entertain any doubt. In
the language of the day, there is a great future' for
Australia; and that not only on account of what is
beneath, but what is on the surface of the ground.
wool is destined to be the main resource of one of our
most important manufactures, if it is not so already.

In certain papers relative to crown-lands, presented
to parliament at the opening of the session of 1851,
there is a dispatch from the governor of New South
Wales to the secretary for the colonies, in which it is
stated that gold had been found in various parts not
only of this colony but in that of Port Philip. The

have not been able to learn the precise locality where
it was found, except that it is on the western side of

statement is explicit. Gold had been found on the
western side of the great range of mountains that
separate the inner country from the extreme belt of
land on which Sydney is situated. This exactly
agrees with Bathurst, which is a high-lying district
beyond the mountains, in a direction almost due
west from Sydney. It is evident, therefore, that the
lately-arrived account of gold-finding is no new thing
to the home government. From the nature and extent
of the investigations now going on in Australia, it is
indeed pretty evident that we shall soon hear of other
important discoveries which have assumed a practical
shape. Although prepared by a previous knowledge of
the fact, that gold existed in the Bathurst Plains, the
governor of New South Wales appears to have been
startled, as everybody else has been, with the intelligence
that diggings had actually commenced, and were suc-
cessfully carried on. It is somewhat remarkable, in
this as in most other instances of the kind, that the full
discovery was not made by pioneers of science, specially
employed for the purpose, but by persons moving in
the rank of shepherds or commercial adventurers. It
is mentioned that an old Scotch shepherd had for some
time known of the Bathurst gold, and secretly profited
by it. Probably this very sly individual had not any
adequate idea of the extent of the deposits, and merely
pocketed some stray morsels of the precious metal.
The discoverer, so far as general publicity was con-
cerned, is a Mr Hargraves, who had been in California,
and was led to conjecture the presence of gold from the
similarity of the rocks. These rocks, we believe, are
chiefly quartz-a hard, brittle material, of which the
white candy-stone of Scotch rivers presents an ex-
ample. It requires to be understood that gold is not
found in the character of a sulphate--that is, mixed
with a stony and gaseous substance, which must be
expelled by smelting, as in the case of lead, copper, and
most other metals. It may be said to come pure and
ductile from the hand of nature. When found, there-
fore, it requires only to be mechanically separated from
the rocks or rubbish in which it is embedded. Usually,
it is in the form of grains and small lumps, varying
from the size of a pea to that of a walnut, carried down
by streams, and rolling amidst sand and gravel: these
particles, large and small, are best secured by washing
with water the loose and lighter materials being
floated off, and the gold afterwards picked out from the
heavier substances that sink to the bottom of the
vessel. Gold-finding is, in truth, fully as much a
matter of jumbling and washing as it is of digging;
and as these jumblings take place in the beds of rivers,
it will easily be imagined how severe and hazardous is
the labour.
The gold diggings of Bathurst became generally
known in the colony about the beginning of May; and
no sooner did the news spread than a kind of madness
seized on the community. In the town of Bathurst, as
we learn from the following local account, the excite-
ment was extreme:*People of all trades, callings,
and pursuits were quickly transformed into miners;

The blacksmiths of the town could not turn off the
picks fast enough, and the manufacture of cradles was
the second-briskest business of the place. A few left
town on Monday equipped for the diggings; but on
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday the roads to Sum-
mer Hill Creek became literally alive with new-made
miners from every quarter; some armed with picks,
others shouldering crowbars or shovels, and not a few
strung round with wash-hand basins, tin-pots, and cul-
lenders. Garden and agricultural implements of every
variety either hung from the saddle-bow or dangled
about the persons of the pilgrims to Ophir. Now and
then a respectable tradesman, who had just left his
bench or counter, would heave into sight with a huge

provided with a blanket, a
grubbing-hoe, full of hopes that one or two days' labour
will fill their pockets with the precious metal; and we
have heard of a great number who have started without
any provision but a blanket and some rude implement
to dig with. Such is the intensity of the excitement,
that people appear almost regardless of their present
comfort, and think of nothing but gold.'

very materially to fan the excitement into a flame was

of pure metal weighing eleven ounces, which was pur-
chased by Mr Austin for L.30, who started to Sydney
by the following day's mail with the gold and the news.
Since that an old man arrived in town with several
pieces in mass, weighing in all from two to three
pounds. He also started for Sydney with his prize.
Mr Kennedy, the manager of the Bathurst branch of
the Union Bank of Australia, visited the diggings on
Saturday last in company with Messrs Hawkins and
Green. Each of these gentlemen picked up a small
piece of the pure metal; and a few handfuls of the
loose earth from the bed of the creek, which were
brought home by Mr Kennedy, and from motives of
curiosity have since been assayed by Mr Corfe from
Sydney, and a piece of gold extracted therefrom of the
size of a small pea. On Wednesday morning last Mr

washed a pan of earth in his presence, from which
twenty grains of fine gold were produced. He after-
wards washed several buckets of earth and produced
gold therefrom. Mr Stutchbury hereupon expressed
his satisfaction, and immediately furnished him with
credentials, which have since been forwarded to govern-
ment. The fact of the existence of gold is therefore
clearly established; and whatever credit or emolument
may arise therefrom, Mr Hargraves is certainly the
individual to whom it properly belongs. We have very
much more to say, but we have not space to say it in. A
Mr Rudder, an experienced California gold-digger, is now
at work at the diggings. There are also several magis-
trates plying their picks and cradles most laboriously,
but we have not heard with what success. In fact,
there appears every probability of a complete social
revolution in the course of time. Those who are not
already departed are making preparations. Servants
of every description are leaving their various employ-
ments, and the employers are, per necessitatem, preparing
to follow. But notwithstanding all this, we feel confi-
dent that a reaction will speedily take place. The
approach of winter and wet weather will do something
towards cooling the ardour of the excited multitude.'
In other Australian papers we have similar accounts
of the frenzy. In the new and unforeseen position in

diggings and their locality, which will be perused with

have afflicted the Californian community.
It is expected that thousands will soon be on the
road from Sydney, many of whom will most certainly
be egregiously disappointed, and rue the day they gave
up their ordinary avocations for gold-hunting. Let no
one come who cannot stand up to his knees in the cold
water for hours; who cannot lie down in wet clothes,
and sleep under the greenwood-tree; who does not
know how to make a damper or a fire when every bit
of timber round is soaking wet. The only possible
chance of doing any good is for six or eight to form a
company, provide themselves with a tent, plenty of
provisions, necessary machines and tools; and by inces-
sant labour and co-operation it is not improbable a
profit may be realised. The good folks of Bathurst,
however, seem to be determined to keep people from
coming into the district, by raising their prices to a
most unjust and extravagant pitch. Flour is L.40 per
ton; 8s. are asked for shoeing a horse, 10s. for a small
pick, &c. This absurd overreaching will compel many
industrious men-determined to stick to their work
notwithstanding the temptation to go gold-hunting-to
find employment elsewhere. The flock-masters are in
great consternation; already have flocks of sheep been
deserted by their shepherds, and left in the bush. I
was greatly amused on returning from the bustling
scene, when meeting a magistrate, a sheep-owner,
attired in his mining-frock, who, accompanied by his
brothers and two heavily-laden carts for the diggings,
deplored the consequences that would fall upon those
who are seized with the gold mania.'
Having made a hurried visit to the gold-fields of
this district, for the purpose of satisfying myself as to
the reality of the reports which were daily arriving in
Bathurst during last week, causing the greatest excite-
ment amongst all classes, I have forwarded a slight
account of the diggings, thinking it would not be
unacceptable to many of your readers. The locality is
about thirty-five miles hence; eight miles from Cornish
Town, and twelve from Orange. There is a tolerable
bridle-road, and even loaded drays are brought down
to the spot by taking the road through Blackman's
Swamp. It is at the junction of Summer Hill and
Lewis' Ponds Creeks, where the diggers are now at
work. There is nothing peculiar in the appearance of
the country, broken ridges and continuous hills of
quartz being the principal features. On arriving at the
diggings, which lie in the narrow bed of the creek,
where there is not level standing-room for fifty people,
a singular and exciting scene presented itself. About
two hundred individuals were congregated (though
large parties were hourly arriving), forming as motley a
group as could possibly be brought together, and attired
in every conceivable style of costume, the fierce
and brigandish seeming to be the one most in vogue.
From the magistrate down to the shirtless vagabond,
the features of every one bore an expression of bewil-
dered anxiety. It was evident that by far the greater
portion of the people went there with the expectation
of picking up lumps of gold among the rocks and stones
of the creek, many arriving with nothing but a pick or
a spade, and not provision even for a single meal, or a
covering for night. The ridges all around were covered
with hundreds of horses, though there is not sufficient
grass to feed a dozen. I did not see more than three
camps erected, the majority of the diggers seeming to
imagine that a covering overhead is totally unnecessary
in this auriferous region; and bitterly must they have
repented for their want of forethought, as towards
evening a pelting shower came down, continuing at
intervals during the whole night and next day, no
doubt considerably cooling the ardour of the gold-
seekers. With respect to the quantity of gold to be
found, no one with the slightest knowledge of geology
can doubt that it exists in great abundance somewhere
near the spot. A spadeful of earth taken from any
part of the banks of the creek, and carefully washed,
will produce gold more or less. But nothing can be
done without proper machines for separating the gold
from the earth, sand, and particles of iron which are
That the very success that attends these explorations
affords matter for regret is a saddening consideration.
By the universal flight of servants, more particularly
shepherds and sheep-shearers, prodigious loss will be
incurred, and the ordinary wool export-trade seriously
damaged. All the Australian colonies will thus suffer
more or less from the discovery; and even New Zealand
will come in for a share of the disaster-though, it
must be admitted, likewise for a share of the benefit,
for a market will be opened for its grain which it never
anticipated. To take the worst view of the affair: the
evils can only be temporary, for a vast wave of
emigration will speedily roll like a flood towards the
antipodes, and fill up all the vacancies that can be
made. And as each emigrant becomes a large con-
sumer of British manufactures, it is evident that the
home country, in parting with its redundant labour,
will largely profit by these marvellous Australian
diggings.

information has reached us from New South Wales,

was chiding with merry enjoyment the while for his
tricksy young-mannishness."

Julius Cæsar was the father of the correct theory of
population. The book he had been crying over-and
his eyes were still red-was Andersen's 'Dichters
Bazaar;' and the passage that affected the poor fellow
was that descriptive of Andersen's rencontre at Inns-
bruck with a young Scotchman, on a sentimental
journey, who manifested so much emotion at the
resemblance of the scenery to his own native hills, and
broke into a torrent of tears when Andersen, to
intensify the association, began to sing a well-known
Scottish air. Sentimental myself, I could not for the
life of me scold one so susceptible to Heimweh; 80
instead of abusing I began to pump him, catechising
him about the literature and national characteristics of
his land of the mountain and the flood.' Of all living
authors he panegyrised chiefly Professor Wilson, whom
hitherto I had known by repute only as the editor of
Blackwood. He dwelt enthusiastically on the critic, the
poet, the novelist, and last, not least, the man; telling
me many a tradition, apocryphal or otherwise, of his
blithe boyhood, his Oxford career, and his doings at
Elleray; how he threw himself into the roistering
companionship of gipsies and tinkers, potters and
strolling-players; how he served as waiter, and won
at a Welsh inn;t
all hearts-Boniface's included-
how at Oxford he repeatedly fought a pugnacious
shoemaker; and how, in all such encounters, he mag-
nanimously recorded himself beaten when beaten he
was. I returned to my rooms that day with a pile
of Wilson's writings under my arm.
The critics en masse will support me, I apprehend, in
preferring Wilson's prose to his poetry. The latter is
apt to pall upon the taste; it is too dainty, too elevated,
too ornamental a thing for the uses of this working-
day world.' It is delicious when seen in an extract;
but, read in extenso, it is almost suggestive of a yawn.
Moods of mind there are when it pleases almost beyond
compare; but they are exceptional, transient. If you
exult in it at soft twilight, and find that it then laps
your senses in elysium, the probability is that at mid-
day you will wonder what has come to it or to yourself
that the spell is broken, the rapture diluted into
satiety, the surge and swell of inspiration smoothened
to a dead calm. According to Dr Moir, its grand
characteristics are delicacy of sentiment, and ethereal
elegance of description-refining and elevating what-
ever it touches. § It avoids the stern and the rugged

at the expense of the sublime; preferring whatever is
gentle, placid, and tender. The result of this, however,
is-as Lord Jeffrey pointed out-along with a tranquil-
lising and most touching sweetness, a certain monotony
and languor, which ordinary readers of poetry will be
apt to call dulness. As Wilson's friend, Macnish-the
modern Pythagorean-characterises it:
"
His strain like holy hymn upon the ear doth float,
Or voice of cherubim, in mountain vale remote.'
It is not of the earth, earthy. But so much the more
it fails in human interest, and seems to soar above
human sympathies as though, like the Ettrick
Shepherd's Kilmeny,' or our own Fouqué's 'Undine,'
the link were broken which 'bound it in the bundle of
life' with common clay. 'I should like,' said Allan
Cunningham, to live in a world of John Wilson's
making: how lovely would be the hills, how romantic
the mountains; how clear the skies, how beauteous the
light of the half-risen sun; how full of paradise the
vales, and of music the streams! The song of the
birds would be for ever heard, the bound of the deer
for ever seen; thistles would refuse to grow, and hail-
showers to descend; while amid the whole woman would
walk a pure, unspotted creature, clothed with loveli-
ness as with a garment, the flowers seeking the pressure
of her white feet, the wind feeling enriched by her
breath, while the eagle would hesitate to pounce upon
the lambs, charmed into a dove by the presence of
beauty and innocence.' This applies rather to the
'Isle of Palms' and to 'Unimore' than to the 'City of
the Plague,' the very title of which is sufficiently dis-
cordant with the above description, and the subject of
which was declared monstrous by Southey.* It is,'
says he, out- Germanising the Germans; it is like
bringing rack, wheels, and pincers upon the stage to
excite pathos.' Perhaps the tu quoque might be here
retorted upon the author of 'Thalaba' with considerable
unction; and at anyrate he must include in his censure
the genius of Dante, of Boccaccio, of Defoe, of Man-
zoni, of Shelley, of Brockden Brown, and many another
greater or lesser star. One cannot help wondering,
however, that even with this theme Wilson should write
so little that is powerful amid so much that is pathetic;
that he should raise so few spirits of terror from the
vasty deep of his imagination; and that, at his warm
touch, the freezing horrors of such a topic should melt,
thaw, and dissolve themselves almost into a gentle dew.
Descriptions beautiful exceedingly' abound in this
work; and of his minor poems, 'gems of purest ray
serene' are Edith and Nora,' the Address to a Wild
Deer,' and the 'Lines Written in a Highland Glen.'
6
To his novels and tales, with all their peculiar charm,
the same objection of languor and monotony' is also
applicable. He is too apt to cancel from his pictures
whatever would offend a too fastidious ideal; to elimi-
nate every negative quantity; to give us the rose without
the thorn, poetry without prose, man without original
sin. His shepherds and shepherdesses, his swains and
cottars, are nearly as unreal, though far more interest-
ing, than the pastoral creatures dear to Shenstone and
Dresden china. They flit before us like figures in
bas-relief, which want more background and less
statuesque uniformity. Jeffrey, in his review of
'Margaret Lyndsay,' 'Lights and Shadows,' &c. ob-
jected to them as lamentably deficient in that bold and
sketches were lectures delivered to the Philosophical Institution
of Edinburgh in the winter of 1850-1. The volume is a faithful and
generous estimate of the great poets of the age just past or still
eurrent. We do not, indeed, know any book which may be more
confidently recommended to the young of the present day who may
be anxious to know what is best worth their attention in one
important branch of recent literature. Most sad it is to reflect
that the amiable and accomplished author-the DELTA of Black-
wood's Magazine '-was suddenly cut off in the vigour of his days
in July last.-Ed. C. E. J.

free vein of invention, that thorough knowledge of the
world, and rectifying spirit of good sense which redeem
all Scott's flights from the imputation either of extra-
vagance or affectation. But all must acknowledge the
exquisite pathos and the generous enthusiasm conse-
crated everywhere by a pervading purity of sentiment,
which make them justly dear to youth and innocence.
Come we now to his connection with periodical
literature. Putting on the anonymous, he forthwith
became broader in girth, higher in stature, greater in
strength. Like the cap of Fortunatus, it seemed to
endow him with new faculties. Addison says there
are few works of genius that come out at first with the
author's name; and adds: "For my own part, I must
declare, the papers I present the public are like fairy
favours, which shall last no longer than while the
author is concealed.' No sooner had Christopher
North shouldered his crutch than he shewed how fields
are won-handling it like a sceptre that made him
monarch of all he surveyed. He did not indeed use
his liberty as a cloak for licentiousness, but he was
laughingly and laughably reckless in his doings and
darings. Coleridge in one of his monologues, as De
Staël called them, blamed his lawless expenditure of
talent and genius in his protracted management of
'Blackwood,' but at the same time exclaimed:"How
can I wish that Wilson should cease to write what so
often soothes and suspends my bodily miseries, and my
mental conflicts!' How indeed? With such cordiality
in his chuckle, such glee in his eccentricities, such
genius in his vagaries, such method in his madness,
who could frown on the extravaganzas of North any
more than utter grave strictures on the All Fools'
Day' of Charles Lamb? It was all so genial that you
forgave everything and forgot nothing. And then his
eloquence was truly as 'the rush of mighty waters'—
'How the exulting thoughts,
Like children on a holiday, rush forth
And shout, and call to every humming bee,
And bless the birds for angels !'
One of his Cockney' victims, upon whose shoulders
he had laid the crutch with more bone-crushing (bein-
brechend) emphasis than any other man's, eulogises his
prose as a rich territory of exuberance congenial with
Keats's poetry-a forest tempest-tossed indeed, compared
with those still valleys and enchanted gardens, but set
in the same region of the remote, the luxuriant, the
mythological-governed by a more wilful and scornful
spirit, but such as hates only from an inverted spirit of

poor Hartley Coleridge || call Christopher North the
happiest speaking mask since Father Shandy and Uncle
Toby were silent; 'for Elia,' he adds, 'is Charles him-
self.' The unique style of Wilson's criticisms is hardly
conceivable by those amongst us who are ignorant of
his mother-tongue: we have nothing I can point to by
way of parallel, hardly even of resemblance. He has
the wit and searching intellect of Lessing; the facile
analysis of Brockhaus; the philosophic tendency of the

How characteristic these writings were of the man may be
illustrated by a letter of Mrs Grant of Laggan, who, after calling
Wilson the most provoking creature imaginable,' proceeds to
say: 'He is young, handsome, wealthy, witty; has great learning,
exuberant spirits, a wife and children that he dotes on, and no
vice that I know, but, on the contrary, virtuous principles and
feelings. Yet his wonderful eccentricity would put anybody but
his wife wild. She, I am convinced, was actually made on purpose
for her husband, and has that kind of indescribable controlling
influence over him that Catherine is said to have had over that
wonderful savage the Czar Peter.'—Memoirs and Correspondence of

fortune.-ED.
THE FOOL OF LABOUDIE.
SOME people are all hand and some all heart. The
first do and the others feel. The one is always at work
-labouring, creating, producing; the other spends his
life in deploring the miseries of humanity, its sufferings,
its wrongs; but there he stops. The same in private
life: A man of hand supports his family, gives them
good beef and mutton, dresses them well, and proves
that he loves them by making them happy; the man
of heart feels intensely if they are sick, has tears for
the slightest ill that happens, deplores their want of
luxuries and necessaries, sits by his chimney-corner and
talks, but does nothing; proving, after all, that he loves
but himself. He is the most amiable man in the world,
a general favourite in society, an outwardly affection-
ate father and husband; but his children are half-
starved, and his wife goes about in an old gown, which
the man of hand's wife would give away to some beg-
gar to whom it would be useful and welcome. Not
that we object to heart; far from it. A man cannot
have too much feeling if he allies with it the head to
conceive and the hand to execute. A man wholly
without heart is a monster; and the great defect of
Napoleon's character was, that with a mighty head and
stupendous hand he had scarcely any heart. It is the
union of hand and heart, with a head to guide both,
which makes a man a useful member of society.
With all his partisanship and consummate irony, he
is justly praised for tolerance, and for the fine spirit of
frankness and generous good-will which animates many
of his reviews of political and literary foes; for, as
Justice Talfourd observes,† notwithstanding his own
decided opinions, he has a compass of mind large
enough to embrace all others which have noble alliances
within its range. Seldom, if ever in fact, was so
sound and warm a heart allied to so clear a head. If
our Gutzkow is not more trenchant in his satire and
scorn, neither is our Jean Paul more gentle, more melt-
ingly tender, more winning and womanly in his gushing
pathos. The Recreations of Christopher North' collect
some of his choicest miscellanea; but why does he not
make a selection also from that glorious repository of
eccentric, self-willed, ebullient genius, the Nights at
Ambrose's?' Nowhere else does he appear to such
advantage. He there riots in prodigality of intellectual
and imaginative wealth. He deluges you with good
things, and swells the flood with your own tears, now
of sorrow and now of mirth. He hurries you from
sublimity to burlesque; from homily to jeu d'esprit;
from grave disquisition to obstreperous fun: feasting
you alternately with the items in Polonius's bill of fare
-tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
Plautus too light. The Noctes' shew a dramatic
power one could not have surmised from the conduct
of his poetry. An intelligent English critic remarks,
that, barring an occasional irregularity of plot, they are
perfect specimens of comedy. ‡ If any fellow-country-hundred years ago: where agriculture caused twice

the English language, let him for once believe the
assurance of an Anglo-maniac, that the language is

+ Life and Letters of Charles Lamb. Lamb and Wilson met
once only. Talfourd tells us they walked out from Enfield (Lamb's
residence) together, and strolled happily a long summer day; not
omitting, however, a call for a refreshing draught. Lamb called
for a pot of ale or porter--half of which would have been his own
usual allowance; and was delighted to hear the professor, on
the appearance of the foaming tankard, say reproachfully to the
waiter, And one for me!'
Indeed, I know not any comedy in which actual conversation
is so naturally imitated, without ever stiffening into debate or
amirbaan oratory, or slipping into morning-call twaddle.-Hartley
Coleridge.
Ernest Delavigne was the only child of a widow. His
father had been a superior farmer of considerable pro-
perty, and had died leaving the land to his wife and
son. But Ernest, though fond of the country, aspired
to be something better than the peasantry around him.
He lived in a part of France where ignorance prevailed
over knowledge; where bad roads and impenetrable
bogs retarded the progress of civilisation; and where
the people were in that happy state of ignorance
which prevailed over most parts of Europe some two
the labour and gave half the returns which it afforded
to the more enlightened; and where no one had ever
yet attempted to penetrate the crust of barbarism
which generally prevailed. Ernest had been educated
at a town-school, and when a young man completed
his education at a provincial college. Though acquir
ing all the general knowledge which was conveyed
by the professors, he devoted himself particularly to
chemistry as applied to agriculture, and to the for-
mation of new aratorial instruments. He returned
home at twenty-one full of magnificent projects. He
would effect a revolution in the land; he would open
a course of lectures; he would teach them the advan-
tages of all the new instruments of draining, of manu-
ring; and, above all, he would effect a complete altera-
tion in the dwellings-close, dirty, unwholesome, and
comfortless now. Admirable and praiseworthy notion
was that of Ernest Delavigne. We shall see how he
carried it out.
Ernest had, as he thought, a very plain way before
him. He set up as a lecturer, with the honest design
of instructing his less intelligent neighbours. Unfor-
tunately, however, nobody went to his lectures; and
all his solicitations met with a polite but peremptory
rebuff. The people, in fact, liked their own way best,
and would believe nothing to the contrary on mere
hearsay. He was generally spoken of as a fool for his
pretensions-the Fool of Laboudie.'

induced him to abandon all attempts at reformation,
and he betook himself to Paris a somewhat wiser man.
Experience had cooled his ardour for improving man-
kind. Arrived in Paris, he took up his lodging in the
quartier Latin, and went to see M. Benoit, a notary in
high repute with the old aristocracy, who confided to him
the management of their pecuniary affairs with a confi-
dence and security which spoke volumes for his honesty
and honourable character. He received M. Ernest kindly,
listened to what he had to say patiently, and then gave
him advice. He approved of his selecting medicine as a
profession, and promised, if it pleased him, to introduce
him into good society, that the intervals of time between
his studies might be well spent. Eruest accepted gladly,
and at once began the study of his new profession. It
suited his character, his feeling for suffering humanity,
to be the healer of the sick; and the prospect of asso-
ciating as a student with the upper classes of society
was pleasant and agreeable. He went to public lec-
tures; he read hard; and in the evenings he visited
one or two salons, which were freely opened to him on
the recommendation of M. Benoit.
He found this way of passing his time vastly agree-
able. He liked the conversation of ladies; for they, as
he abstained from politics, sympathised with his views,
approved of his humanitarian principles, and proved
always an attentive audience. One evening he was
speaking of his old and favourite topic-the introduc-
tion of agricultural improvements into the country-
when a young girl joined in the debate.
'Oh, monsieur,' she cried warmly, 'I am happy to
meet with some one of my way of thinking. I lived
in a country district which is very much behind the
age, and having been some years in England, which
enjoys such a vast superiority in this particular over
any other part of the world, I am deeply anxious to
see the example of our neighbours followed.'
Ernest was delighted, and after a few minutes he
addressed his whole conversation to Mile Louise de
Redonté. He found her to his astonishment learned
in all farming details, though a year younger than
himself; aware of more improvements in machinery
than he had ever known of; and deeply conversant
with all that was necessary to the comfort and well-
being of both men and animals employed in agri-
culture. Before the end of the evening Ernest was
in love. A French novelist would tell us that he
had met his destiny. At all events, he considered him-
self fortunate to have fallen in with so charming a
person, who joined to great beauty and accomplishment
a taste for his favourite subjects of thought and talk.
Ernest and Louise met continually, and each day
they renewed their intimacy. They talked together,
they danced together, and before the end of three
months the young man scarcely missed an evening
at the house of Mme de Lastange, where she resided
when in town. People at last began to insinuate to
the old lady, that the friendship of the young people
was rather warmer than should properly exist between
a student in medicine and a rich heiress. A few days
after this Ernest missed Mile Louise de Redonté from
the evenings of Mine de Lastange, who, without the
least change in her manner towards him, informed him
that she was gone to the country to her uncle, where
indeed she spent the greater part of the year. She
was a kind-hearted woman, and by this separation
simply wished to spare both the pain which she thought
must ensue if their affections became engaged. Ernest
felt very dull: the charm of the soirées was gone. He
did not cease to go, however, because it was probable
that he might again see her there, but his visits became
less frequent, and thus the season ended.
During the long summer months that ensued Ernest
continued the study of his profession. He wrote to his
mother that he should not come that year to the
country, because his disgust at his neighbours was
so great he could not bear to meet with them. Besides,
he wished to continue his studies, which would suffer
by interruption. But he did not now devote himself
to his books with half the same zest with which he had
begun. His thoughts were far away in that country
region, wherever it was, where Louise resided, and he
thought the summer never would end. To distract his
attention he varied his reading, added novels, poetry,
and history to his scientific books; and thus with many
a yawn, and many a longing, and many a weary hour,
the time passed, and when the salon of Mme de Lastange
again opened, Ernest presented himself the very first
evening.
Louise de Redonté was there, more lovely than ever;
and she welcomed the young man, as he eagerly ad-
vanced to greet her, with a smile which filled him with
rapture. Mme de Lastange looked on in some alarm.
Louise was in mourning: she had lost her uncle nearly
six months, and she was rich in the extreme.
She was
surrounded at once by a perfect host of suitors, but
she gave encouragement to none. Ernest still con-
tinued her favourite companion, to the great annoyance
of the mass of young men about town, who would have
been delighted to have given her their name, and to
have spent her hundred thousand francs of annual
income. Still no one looked upon the intimacy of
Louise and Ernest as anything likely to end seriously.
The crowds of suitors who filled the salons of Mme
de Lastange supposed that the young lady was a
clever person, and shewed a preference for the con-
versation of the medical student-an individual she
could not marry-simply that she might look round
unobserved and unsuspected, and choose for herself.
'My dear Louise,' said her friend one day to her,
how much longer do you mean to keep the men in
suspense? There are more than a dozen dying for
love'-
'Of my château and cash,' replied Louise laughing;
but I am quite sure I shall see them all as rosy as ever
next season.'
Do you not, then, mean to select your future hus-
band before you again bury yourself in your gloomy
castle?' said Mme de Lastange in an alarmed tone.
'My dear madame, I am rich, I am young, I have
time and independence. I shall not choose a husband
until I have found a lover whose affection is real, and
whom I myself can like.'
Mme de Lastange mentioned several of her suitors
with high praise, but Louise shook her head, and found
fault with all.
'I have no patience with you,' cried the good lady.
You encourage that young student so much, that you
have no time to judge the merits of others. I have a
great mind to close my door against him.'
'My dear De Lastange,' replied Louise gravely, 'if
you cease to receive my protégé, you will make my
evenings very dull. I shall run to the country a month
sooner.'
Mme de Lastange sighed, and turned away, but she
studiously avoided letting Ernest notice her annoy-
ance; still, when the friends were together, she looked
annoyed, and almost began to agree with those who
supposed Louise to have some secret object in encou-
raging the medical student.
Where do you intend settling on the completion of
your studies?' said Louise one evening.
In Paris, or some other large town,' replied Ernest.
In town! I thought you preferred country life,'
continued she, as if somewhat disappointed.
'I did once, but I have changed my mind. I origi-
nally intended devoting myself to agriculture; but
now I have a profession, I prefer living in cities.'
'But why?'
In the first place, to live in the country I should
require a wife; but I despair of finding one suited to
me,' replied Ernest unaffectedly.

'But what kind of a wife would you like?' asked
Louise, looking at him curiously.
May I tell you?' said he timidly, looking up at her
like a child looking at his mother when asking a
favour. Of course he was allowed to speak his mind;
and, need we add, there was in almost no time a
thorough mutual understanding. Mademoiselle was a
Frenchwoman, and, as such, was not burdened with
diffidence.
Next evening it was generally known that Ernest
Delavigne and Louise de Redonté were affianced, to the
great consternation of all fortune-hunters, and the great
joy of all those who sympathised with truthful, feel-
ing, and sincere affection. But the salons of Mme de
Lastange were no longer crowded: the host of inte-
rested suitors vanished.
'Do you know,' said Louise one evening as they
were talking of the future, that I mean to make a
regular patriarch of you? I have determined to intro-
duce among all my farmers and their neighbours the
latest improvements, and to give them the benefit of
all the agricultural discoveries of England and France.'
'It is useless making such attempts,' replied Ernest
gravely; 'you will but lose your temper and your time.'
'Monsieur! Why you are as bad as the fool of
Laboudie.'
Hah!' said Ernest, turning very pale.
'Why,' continued the merry girl, without noticing
his uneasiness, you must know that my castle is close
to Laboudie. My uncle was the Count de Plouvieres.'
'Oh!' replied Ernest.
'Well, there came from a neighbouring town, some
two years back, a young man belonging to our place,
who had studied agriculture, and who desired, it
appears, to reform the neighbourhood. Instead of
introducing the change himself, however, he tried to
persuade others to do so; told the ignorant farmers of
what they might do, but did not attempt to demon-
strate his theories. People naturally enough laughed
at his lectures-his disquisitions especially; as I am
told he had land himself, and never thought of trying
the sensible experiment of shewing his neighbours by
practice the advantages he believed, but did not know
to exist. Such well-meaning men are worse than
useless: they stand more in the way of real progress
than the most obstinate devotee of antiquity; they are
mere sentimental, and not practical reformers. But
why so gloomy, Ernest? Surely I have not offended
you? I see you are a little unwell. Good-night.
Go home to bed, and tell your old concierge to make
you some tisane. It will soon be my office to take care
of monsieur when he thinks proper to be ill.'
Ernest took her proffered hand, shook it even more
heartily than usual, and went away. It was early
just before midnight, and as the other guests were
about to depart, the bonne of Mme de Lastange gave a
letter to Louise, who alone, in a little boudoir where
she had retired, since none but card-players remained,
at once opened and read it.
'I write not in anger but with deep sorrow. I love
you too much to expose you to a life of misery. You
have expressed too much contempt for persons of my
character not to be very unhappy when you know me
better. You will doubtless find, however, one worthy
of you. I shall seek, after that severe but just lesson
which I have now received, to win your esteem now
that your love is impossible. Remember me kindly, if
it be only because I have sufficient sense left to save
you in time from everlasting unhappiness. This night,
at eleven, I start for home.'
'What have I done?' cried Louise. 'Poor Ernest!
how generous, how noble, how good! Poor fellow!
how those thoughtless, bitter words must have gone
to his heart. I must stop him. But no: he is gone.
Well, I must wait until to-morrow. What a night
he will pass travelling! How cruel he must think
me!' And away she hurried to bed, as if by so doing
the morrow would sooner come.
Meanwhile Ernest, whose mind had been enlarged
and elevated by more extended studies, went away on
his road home, subdued, dejected, and yet not wholly
cast down. He saw distinctly the truth of all that
Louise had said; he perceived where his own errors
lay, and determined to profit by the lesson. He arrived
at home after a long journey, calm, serious, and full of
strong conviction of his own former pride, which made
his present humility all the more pleasing. His mother
was delighted to see him; and when he declared his
intention of devoting himself in future to the farm, she
was doubly pleased. He took up his former quarters,
and then, after a day's rest, started for a long walk to
recruit his body, somewhat enervated by study and
town life. He followed the high road which led to the
Château de Plouvieres, along which were several small
farms, and one or two very extensive ones. He walked
along, his eyes fixed on the ground, in deep meditation,
until he was suddenly aroused by a loud voice.
'Hollo there! Monsieur Ernest, I want to speak
with you,' said the very old farmer whom he had first
made an attempt upon nearly two years before.
'What is it?' replied young Delavigne, raising his
head a little haughtily; what can you have to say to
the Fool of Laboudie?'
'Sir!' cried the other, as they approached each
other; 'I beg your pardon, and we all beg your pardon.
But do you not see we did not understand your fine
talk? and we could not believe what we didn't see.
But then Mile Louise, our guardian angel, had just
finished her model-farm, and there she had all the
improvements of which you told us. Well, when we
saw that really there were better ways than we knew of,
you see we agreed to try, and I've bought a new plough
here it is-and it's a little out of order, and it's just
to ask your advice about mending it that I called you.'
'With pleasure,' said Ernest, who had listened to the
other's words with deep interest. 'Oh, it's nothing: a
couple of nails and a screw is all that's wanted.'
Half an hour later the defect was remedied, and the
two were at breakfast together. The old man said
that if Ernest would now open his lectures they would
be well attended of an evening; and if confined to
descriptions referring to things the farmers began to
understand, would continue so. The young man
replied that he would make himself acquainted with
what had been done, and would deliver his first lecture
on the following Sunday-the only day when a rural
population in France could be collected together for
such a purpose. Next day Ernest visited the model-
farm of the Château de Plouvieres. He found a
considerable tract of land under cultivation. The
head was an Englishman, who had resided some years
in Normandy, and his assistants were French. He
had, moreover, fourteen pupils, sons of neighbouring
farmers. Mr Wilson informed Ernest that it was only
the powerful influence of the Count de Plouvieres, and
the affection of the people for Louise his niece, which
had enabled him to obtain their youth to bring up in
improved notions. But now, he said, all went along
easily. The farmers and their families felt and saw
the great benefits which lay within their grasp, and, as
their patrons gave them facilities for paying for all
new instruments by instalments, few refused to avail
themselves of the opportunity. On fête days and holi-
days the whole neighbourhood come to the model-farm,
to amuse themselves by looking around; and a change,
he said, was already perceptible. One house which
had been burnt down close by had been rebuilt upon
new principles with regard to comfort and cleanliness,
and all were anxious to follow the example.
Ernest was more than ever convinced of the wisdom
of the practical course adopted by the Count de Plou-
vieres and Louise de Redonté. He saw clearly that if

we would induce men to believe in our precepts, we
must practise them ourselves; and that one example
is worth a hundred expositions. He went away filled
with admiration at the nobility of character, the sound
sense and wisdom, of the young reformer, and with his
heart doubly imbued with love for the beautiful girl.
He prepared his lecture in his mind during the whole
three days which intervened, and when the hour came,
entered the barn amid loud applause. The place was
full. The whole neighbourhood, male and female, was
there, with Mr Wilson, his assistants, and pupils.
Everybody understood now that the object of Ernest
Delavigne had been good; and all blamed themselves
for not comprehending him, though in reality the fault
was with him, who had not understood the right way
to proceed.
Ile began. In eloquent words, with deep and strong
feeling, he drew a picture of Laboudie before and after
the return of Louise from England: he compared in a
humorous way the different line pursued by the young
lady and the Fool of Laboudie (great laughter and
applause): he acknowledged her means to be greater,
but also allowed that he might have made his own
land the model-farm by industriously devoting himself
to the very course of improvement which he recom-
mended: he called down the blessings of Heaven on
the lovely patroness of the locality, hardly able to
restrain tears as he spoke, and then opened with his
subject. He used simple and plain language: he spoke
of things which all began to understand, and was
listened to with deep interest and respectful attention.
When he sat down the barn almost seemed about to
fall, so violently did they shake it with their bravos
and clapping of hands. But it was late, and most had
a long way to go; so the assemblage dispersed, after
receiving gratefully the promise of a continuation that
day-week.
But one person lingered behind, and stood within the
barn when all had left it save Ernest and his mother.
They had reached the door before they made the
discovery.
'Mile la Comtesse,' said Mme Delavigne respectfully.
'Ernest!' replied she, holding out her hand.
'Louise!' exclaimed he, for he saw in the smile
which accompanied the offer of her hand that she was
unchanged.
'And so monsieur runs away, and I must run after
him!' said Louise, taking his arm. 'What think you,
madame,' she continued: your son a month ago asked
me to marry him; I consented, and a week ago he ran
away, declaring he would not have me. Am I not
very good to come and fetch him?'
'Louise! Louise!' replied Ernest passionately; 'I
did not think you could marry the Fool of Laboudie.'
'My dear friend, my speech of the other evening only
shews how wrong people are to judge from appearances.
I had only heard a description of you under that name
from an old servant, whose gossips I have been suffi-
ciently punished for retailing.'
'But, my son,' cried the amazed mother, 'what is
the meaning of all this?'
'My dear madame, that we are to be married, accord-
ing to previous agreement, to-morrow three weeks,' said
Louise, taking her hand; and that my husband is
about to complete the work which I have so imperfectly
begun.'
The whole affair was the most off-hand thing imagin-
able. The marriage of these two clever people-each
clever in a particular way, the very difference of cha-
racter being useful-created little surprise. Previous
to the old revolution, M. de Lavigne-a name Ernest
resumed, now he held a social position which ceased to
make the aristocratic de assuming-had held nearly as
high a position as the Count de Plouvieres. But he
had not emigrated-preferring to fall into the position
of a farmer to a wandering exile in a foreign land. At
the restoration his property, sold during two years
he passed in prison as a suspect, remained in the hands
of the ward purchaser. But he had still a respectable
estate, if he farmed it himself, and he continued to do
so; and Monsieur Delavigne, despite its plebeian look,
was quite as happy as he had been when M. de Lavigne.
But his son, for the sake of his wife and her relatives,
resumed the name of his right, to which he modestly
avoided allusion until a few days before their marriage.
And now it was difficult to say which was the hand
and which was the heart. Ernest had learned that
mere personal sympathy with the ignorance or misery
of our fellow-creatures is of little use, if we do not
raise our hands and arms to do something; and that the
true friends of humanity are those who do their utmost
to diffuse knowledge, to widen the circle of man's utility,
and who by example and practice lead the march of civi-
lisation. Every man may thus do his part in the great
work of human progress. All that is wanted is the will to
be useful. Ernest and Louise de Lavigne were a blessing
to the whole country round. Smiling meadows, neat
houses, productive fields, healthy peasantry, the absence
of any glaring cases of poverty, considerable elevation
of mind, above that which is the ordinary lot of the
agricultural labourers, are the practical results of this
happy disposition of mind, which makes the richest
propriétaire of Laboudie consider all around him as his
children, to whom he owes a fair share of his time and
thoughts. They are intensely beloved, and there are
many yet unborn who will yet live to bless the pleasing
union in Ernest and Louise of the hand and the
heart.
MODERN ISLAND OF THE BLEST.
THERE is a little island called Taboga near the eastern
shore of the Pacific which realises the poetical fable of
the garden of the Hesperides. It is an earthly para-
dise; and its inhabitants are as happy, and almost as
innocent-at least to external appearance as the first
pair. But the fruit of the tree of knowledge is now
ripe for the gathering; the old Serpent already raises
his crest; and in a year or two more this Eden of the
modern world will be turned into a highway of trade,
and its village capital metamorphosed into a dirty,
drunken, dishonest, unsavoury sea-port town. This is
its fate, brought on by no corruption among the people,
and no thirst of gain; for, in fact, being happy as they
are, they would not take the trouble to be rich if they
could help it. But Taboga lies in the path of that
inundation of commerce which is about to sweep from
one ocean to the other; its geographical position has
sealed its destiny; and as soon as the Panama railway
is in operation the produce of the eastern and southern
world will cross in its rising harbours the manufactures
of the west. It is worth while, then, to describe Taboga
and its denizens as they exist in the present remarkable
year-to delineate the paradise just before it is lost;
and we are fortunately favoured with suflicient mate-
rials for the purpose in a file of the Literary World,'
an intelligent journal published in New York.
Let us say, however, at the outset, that the revolu-
tion is not to take place with the suddenness of a
change in a pantomime, for already some note of pre-
paration has been sounded; already some huge black
vessels have floated, panting and snorting and smoking
into the quiet harbour; and already some wild and
greedy eyes have stared at the gentle people through
their orange-groves. These are the pilgrims of Cali-
fornia, going or returning; adventurers from the ends
of the earth in search of gold, and with few more
appliances at first than a pick-axe, a shovel, a sieve, a
gin-bottle, and a bowie-knife. Only think of the
prospect which meets these unquiet spirits as they sail
into the bay, and glide into that enchanted lake which
lies at the opening of a green valley between two lofty

hills! There is no village in the ordinary sense of the
word; but here and there, at the caprice of the owner,
a little hut of cane, thatched with palm-leaves--in all
perhaps amounting to a hundred. These, kept together,
as it were, by a little white-walled church, peep through
the cocoa-nut trees below, or perch upon the rocks that
rise upon the beach, or overhang the bay, or cluster at
the margin of the water, where the tide when at full
murmurs at their door. This beach is the landing-
place for the vessels in the harbour; and the heavy
ship's boat, mounted on an advancing wave, plunges
proudly, high and dry, upon the shore; while the
native canoe, aided only by a careless turn of the
paddle, leaps like a fish completely out of the water.
In the evening the natives are seen in the greatest
numbers upon the beach, whither they come to lie in
little groups, and breathe the cool breeze through their
Tabogan cigars; while the women lounge around them,
cooling their bare feet upon the moist sands; and the
naked children amuse themselves with pursuing the
receding wave into the sea, and flying with sportive
shrieks before its return. These people are of various
origin-some Spanish, some African, some Indian; but
although the normal features remain, the character of
all is alike-genuine Tabogan. The climate of the
island subdues everything to itself. The warm, moist
atmosphere rounds all corners of temper, and the
repose of the still bay sinks into the most unquiet soul.
All circumstances conduce to this dream-like quiet.
No need of work, no competition, no strife, no anxiety
for the future: not one of those causes which in other
countries wrinkle the brow and imbitter the heart exists
in this enchanted island. Exhaustless nature provides
the daily meal: in a climate of perpetual summer, to
build even a bamboo-hut seems a work of supereroga-
tion; and but for fashion's sake, where would be the
need of clothing when there is no such thing as cold to
counteract? Still, the men do build huts that look
like toys, cultivate round them patches of maize and
yams, and scooping out trunks of trees, glide into the
sea to add fish to their banquet of fruit. Another
dainty comes uncalled: not exactly like the fowls that
in a paradise situated elsewhere run about ready
roasted, and with a knife and fork commodiously stuck
in them, crying 'Come, eat me!'--but the land-crabs of
Taboga come down from the hills at a certain season of
the year, and do all but walk into the pot-au-feu. The
name of these creatures, which form a delicious and
wholesome viand, is Legion. The whole island seems to
stir with them. A sound, as if of the pattering of rain-
drops, fills the atmosphere; and on comes the living
inundation to meet the tide of the Pacific on the
sands, where myriads of eggs are deposited, and form
collections for a new inundation next season. The
iguana, an immense lizard, provides another treat,
furnishing both sport and luxurious eating, for it is
hunted in the woods with dogs.
And the people feast and fatten. They have nothing
to do but to enjoy the pleasure of doing nothing.
"
What a strange drowsiness possesses thee!
It is the quality of the climate.
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, running,
And yet so fast asleep!'
They are indolent-not lazy; for when they choose they
can work, and in working employ great strength. But
why trouble themselves with labour? Their drowsiness
is graceful and luxurious. They seem to be enjoying
the soft perfumed atmosphere, and listening to
'Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.'
The forms of the women are beautifully developed,
their movements unrestrained, their looks soft and
tranquil, and their eyes large, full, and slumbering.
They are gaily dressed-as gaily as the enamelled frogs
6
and lizards of the island, whose colours of green, red, and
yellow, glisten in the sun. They owe their finery to the
gallantry of the men, who carry boat-loads of the fruit
that rots around them to Panama, where they obtain
in exchange the gaudiest produce of the looms of Man-
chester, and bright-coloured Chinese kerchiefs. But the
women rarely flaunt their finery abroad. When they
have nothing to do, which is almost all day, they swing
in their hammocks, and at other times pound the
maize for dinner, or plait palm-leaf baskets. The
following is a portrait of one of them, to which it is
impossible for the imagination to add another trait:-
The beauty of the village is Dolores, one of the full-
formed beauties, ripened in the shade and repose of the
island. Swinging all day in her hammock, and moving
only in the early morning or cool evening, to take her
bath in the Taboga stream, and living upon the nutri-
tious maize and rice, and luscious fruit, she has become
as white and smooth-skinned, and rounded and plump,
as one of the Circassian women in the Turkish sultan's
seraglio. Her features have a dreamy, listless expres-
sion, though the fulness of her Spanish and voluptuous
mouth, and the bright sparkle of her black eyes, save
them from dulness and want of interest. Her hair
is a jet black, and flows in thick profusion over her
rounded shoulders, which her low drapery exposes in
all their glistening whiteness and full development.
Her hands and feet are small and white, like those of
most Spanish women, who take heed that no labour or
exposure shall spoil their beauty, of which they are so
proud. All fall in love with Dolores, but she is a sad
coquette, and the world is warned accordingly.'
It is nonsense to warn the world. The world cannot
help loving Dolores; and as for her coquetry, it is a
necessary part of her charms. It is the excitement
which keeps life alive at Taboga, which preserves the
sweets of the island from palling on the taste, and gives
its slumber the chastened energy of a dream. Here
even the lower animals are sleek and slow. The
pelicans standing upon the rocks, with full paunches,
look tenderly down into the sea, like an alderman con-
templating a tureen of turtle-soup, of which he cannot
possibly eat another mouthful till by and by. The fish
that furnish their meal are themselves as fat. There is
not a venomous insect or reptile in the whole island;
or if any of them have poison, they are too well-fed and
lazily good-humoured to use it. The only noisy talkers
within the enchanted precincts are the many-coloured
macaw, which drowns the small still voice of the dove
in the woods, and the cricket, whose shrill cry comes
upon the ear like the distant whistle of a steam-engine.
Among the flowers which perfume the whole atmo-
sphere, the santo espiritu is distinguished for its beauty
and for the religious sentiment which sanctifies it; its
petals being in the form of a dove, and receiving
homage almost amounting to worship from the simple
inhabitants as a symbol of the Holy Ghost.
necessary, likewise, to mention in a special manner the
juvencilla, the soap of the island, which requires no
process of manufacture beyond steeping the leaves of
the plant in water, and so producing a sweet, soft,
creamy lather. This is largely used by the women in
their baths, and they ascribe to it their smooth skins
and rich redundant hair. We have some hesitation in
making this public; for the result of course will
be that tons of juvencilla-a capital quack naine-
of English production will immediately make their
appearance in the market. But no matter.
notion of their possessing the Tabogan talisman of
beauty will go far towards keeping our women in
good-humour; and good-humour, as everybody knows,
is the most magical of all cosmetics.
It is
The very
But the reader who has a feeling of art may tell us
that our picture wants relief; that Dolores herself is
but the highest beauty, the highest indolence, the
highest coquetry of the island; and that the whole

piece has the level of the undulating sea. The criticism
is premature, for Taboga has one landmark, one
unmistakable character rising jagged and abrupt
amid its tranquil population. How this comes about
in the case of the individual referred to, it would puzzle
philosophy to tell. The other inhabitants, no matter
whence their origin, whether coming from cast, west,
north, or south, could offer no resistance to the spirit of
the place. Down they sank at once in that soft, moist,
perfumed atmosphere which washed away for ever their
identity. But Donna Juana, the doctress, was an excep-
tion from the first, and is an exception at this moment.
How she came to the island even the oldest inhabitant
cannot tell. She was there, she is there-that is all the
people know. Tall, gaunt, lean, rawboned, wrinkled,
terrible in eye, shrill in voice, wrathful in temper, and
with a head of fiery hair, Donna Juana laughs to scorn
the influences of the place. There is in the village
a Moorish pirate of the Mediterranean, whose wild
fancies have subsided into dreamy aspirations, vacil-
lating between Dolores and an iguana steak; but
Donna Juana sits upon her bull, the only steed in the
place, as upright as a lance, and casts a half-angry,
half-disdainful glance upon the world beneath her.
The bull is led by her husband, one of the gentle natives,
and both these animals are fat, both obedient, both
scared in their looks. Donna Juana-the name means
gracious, loving!—is a Scotchwoman, and was probably
known in her own country by the more familiar name
of Jean. She is both dreaded and admired by the bull,
the husband, and the islanders in general, and her skill
in physic is considered to be the next thing to super-
natural. Not an angle of her figure has been rounded,
not an accent of her speech softened. She loves dirt as
enthusiastically as if she had never emerged from her
native wynd; and crouching in her low hut, the dirtiest
in the village, surrounded by dirty bottles and dirty
papers, filled with dirty drugs, she looks like a
sorceress. It will be seen that in point of art she is a
necessity of this pleasant land of drowsyhead and
dreams.
Taboga may be reckoned the port of Panama, which
has no safe anchorage, and cannot be approached
within three miles by large vessels. In the former
place there is a large, deep, natural harbour, with
excellent anchorage, an abundant supply of pure water,
and a natural dry dock. This last is a cove between
two banks of rock, into which the largest ship may be
hauled at full tide till her bowsprit invades the orange-
trees at the further end. Here she is left high and dry
by the receding water on a smooth hard beach of sand,
where repairs can be made as readily as if she lay in a
ship-yard. With such advantages it is needless to say
that the fate of Taboga will be settled as soon as the
railway between the two oceans comes into play, and
that the paradise we have felt so happy in describing
will be a paradise lost.
A LITTLE TOO LATE.
THERE is a class of persons who appear to be born or
brought up under the sad fatality of being always a
little too late. This seems to be the rule of their life,
for it takes place with surprising regularity. It would
almost appear that the clock by which they regulated
their actions could not be made to keep pace with the
common time-piece, and they were fated to abide by
its tardy movement. They are not found to be occa-
sionally late, but are invariably so many minutes behind
the proper hour. After careful examination, we have
discovered that the space of ten minutes is the common
degree of difference between this order of men and the
rest of mankind. Among them are some of the most
diligent, laborious, and calculating of our species, yet
they are ten minutes too late for every occupation.
A gentleman of our acquaintance, who is subject to
this mental affection, if so it may be termed, is one of
the most shrewd and active persons of the neighbour-
hood; but nobody who knows him expects him to be
in time for any engagement at home or abroad. Ten
minutes are always allowed for his appearance. His
friends have often rallied him on the subject, and
he takes their banters with the utmost good-humour,
knowing himself to be in fault, although this conscious-
ness does nothing towards curing him of the malady.
He has sometimes suffered great inconvenience in his
transactions with strangers, and even sustained pecu-
niary loss through his tardiness; but he seems to have
no moral power to step over the little chasm by which
he is separated from the marching-hour of the world.
He was advised by an acquaintance to rise a little
earlier than usual one fine summer morning, that he
might overtake Father Time, and keep beside him all
the day. With considerable effort he did rise at half-
past seven instead of twenty minutes to eight, but he
was not at his business till ten minutes past nine. His
friend did not understand the nature of the disease,
but thought it originated from sloth: no such thing-
he is a most industrious man. We found, however,
upon very careful investigation, that there is a tincture
of carelessness about his habits; yet only a tincture.
In all he does one small flaw may be detected by a
minute observer. He forgets to say something, though
it is a mere trifle; he omits one of his engagements,
but one of no importance; he narrates an incident very
nicely, but leaves out one of the circumstances. He
dresses in a neat style, but probably goes out without
a handkerchief (it is in the pocket of his other coat),
or there is a hole in one of his gloves which he has
neglected to have repaired; and he sometimes comes
home having done all his business, but without his
umbrella or walking-stick.
But the
We hoped that the punctuality of railways might
possibly cure our neighbour, as he frequently had
occasion to travel on a particular road. He used
seldom to take a place in the stage-coach lest he might
be too late, but trusted to there being a vacant seat
inside or outside, with which he was content. But
when the business was important, and he had previously
secured a place in the vehicle, the guard knew his
habits, and for the expected douceur compromised the
hour of starting by finding some cause for five minutes'
delay; and if this did not suffice, the coachman drove
warily through the streets till the passenger overtook
them in a 'Hansom's patent' at full gallop.
Fair-trader' was knocked up by the railway. Many
were the warnings he now received that the steam-
trains, like time and tide, wait for no man, and he
buckled up his courage for the next occasion. Being
advised that he should be at London Bridge ten
minutes before the time of starting, he made a desperate
effort to be punctual. He rose before half-past seven,
but was not ready for breakfast till five minutes past
eight. He lost the other five minutes in opening his
portmanteau to put in a small article which he had
forgotten. Still, he was ready to enter the cab at ten
minutes to nine, and it was not a full mile to the
station. He congratulated himself upon the ease with
which the distance would be cleared, and already began
to bless the railway for curing him of his inveterate
lateness. Mr Cab drove lustily, and reached the north
end of London Bridge at precisely five minutes to nine.
Two or three minutes were amply sufficient to land
him in the booking-office. He had never been so early
in his life, for he would have two minutes to spare.
But, alas! some coal-wagons blocked up the way, and
caused a stoppage on the bridge; and when the cab
man had extricated his vehicle and dashed furiously
into the station, our friend heard the guard's whistle
while paying for his ticket. He was told to run; and
as he gained the platform, he saw the train move off
majestically before him, like a ship in full sail. Stop,

stop!' The coach had often stopped for him; but steam-
engines have no ears, and the engineer is deaf to every
sound but that of the whistle. So he had to wait
two hours for another train. When he reached his
destination, his friends who were to wait at the station
with a carriage had gone home, not expecting him to
come that day; so he hired a coach and drove to their
residence, entering the parlour just as the servant was
clearing away the dinner things. Though much mor-
tified, he laid the whole blame of his disaster upon
the thoughtless wagoners who obstructed the bridge;
and next time, instead of being ten minutes earlier in
starting, he went round by a different way. We have
consulted several physicians, physiologists, and natural
philosophers on this subject, asking them to explain
the phenomena of this habitual lateness; but we cannot
learn the cause of the complaint, nor obtain a remedy
for our very worthy friend; so that we fear he must
continue to the end of his life 'a little too late.'
THREE TRIPS IN THE AIR.
In the month of June last, three gentlemen went up in
a balloon from the Hippodrome at Paris, and having
made a voyage of three stages in a north-easterly
direction, one of the trio, M. Ivan Matzneff, published
an account of their observations and adventures in the
pages of the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' which possesses
sufficient interest to entitle it to reappear in a brief
summary. He tells us that he had long cherished a
desire for a trip in the atmosphere, against which the
importance and the charm of the ties that attached him
to this lower world struggled in vain;' and at length
an irresistible proposal having been made to him-to
quote his own words-'on Tuesday, June 5, at seven-
teen minutes past five in the evening, having provided
myself with all the instruments necessary to give some
degree of scientific interest to my observations, I
mounted the car of the Eagle balloon, about to ascend
under the management of M. Godard. My companions
were Mme the Countess de Ss, the Count Alexis
de Pomereu, and one of his friends.'
The air was calm and the sky pure, the party in high
spirits, and without the least thought of danger. Not
one of us,' says M. Matzneff, felt any acceleration in
the beating of his heart;' and for a long time they
enjoyed the panoramic view of the great city beneath,
which inspired the sentiment: Viewing human things
from such a height, one feels that life is more insigni-
ficant and nature greater; the instinct of preservation
recalling to the earth, but still more powerful the
attraction towards the sky.' These contemplations were
interrupted by the lady, who, in sportive humour, amused
herself by causing the car to 'oscillate capriciously'
with sudden shocks, and at times leaning over the
edge, defying the abyss, and seriously compromising our
equilibrium. At last, yielding to the respectful injunc-
tions of the party, she consented to relinquish her
experiments.' After this they dined 'as comfortably as
in one of the saloons of the Frères-Provençaux,' and
drank healths, and talked of the possibility of direct-
ing balloons until it was time to descend. As they
approached the earth, the guide-rope, 150 metres long,
was lowered, and seized by some labourers, who drew
us without a shock to the middle of their field near the
village of Bussy-le-Long,' distant about sixty-six miles
from Paris-the voyage having occupied three hours
and a half.
•
The peasants next towed the balloon to Soissons,
a league from Bussy, where they arrived at half-past
eleven. The soldiers on guard at the gate were not a
little surprised by a request for accommodation for the
balloon, which, however, was granted by the com-
mandant. 'I ran back,' says M. Matzneff, 'to my
companions, who had remained in the car. I seized
the cord which hung in front of our machine, and the
captive balloon entered triumphantly into Soissons
over the fortifications. The population slept; but the
noise we made in hooking some of the chimneys
must have astonished the good Soissonnais, little
accustomed to such visits. The balloon, once secured
in the Place d'Armes, and placed in charge of M.
Godard, junior, the damage to the chimneys paid for
at small cost, we took up our quarters in a hotel, gladly
enjoying the solidity of the earth and the liberty of our
movements.'
M. Godard had determined on making another ascent,
but with diminished numbers, so as to give full play to
the elevating power of the balloon; and while one-half
of the travellers were devising means to return to Paris,
the others prepared for a night ascent, which, as M.
Matzneff writes, 'was not devoid of a certain solemnity.
We could not dissemble its danger. It will be under-
stood, in fact, that in a long journey all the rigging of
a frail machine, in which the weight and the substance
have to be strictly economised, undergoes a notable
deterioration, and requires to be carefully readjusted
and strengthened before fresh service. At the same
time the gas, having become rarer and diminished in
volume, escapes insensibly by the distended seams and
through the silk, on which the varnish is more or less
damaged..... Nevertheless, seduced by the sole idea
reassured by the composure and good-humour of the
of accomplishing something yet unattempted, and
two aëronauts, I shook hands with my companions, laid
in some provisions, and gaily bestrode the clouds at
seven minutes past three to go to meet the sun.
In the
"The panorama was magnificent towards the south;
the north, on the contrary, was covered with haze. At
times there came an insupportable heat; at others a
cold from which I could scarcely defend myself under
my furs, while the sun scorched our faces.
same way, when among the ice you approach a fire
the cold and the heat make themselves felt simul-
taneously in all their intensity. The thermometer,
which at our departure stood at ten degrees (centigrade)
above zero, fell to one degree below, then went up again
to six degrees above, although we were continually
ascending. The aneroid ceased to operate at forty
minutes past three. I then examined my compass,
and found it completely motionless; believing it to be
broken, I handed it to M. Godard, who, however, was
surprised to find it uninjured. The cause of the inac-
tion of this instrument will probably be explained by
science. I offer no conjecture, and state only, that
arrived at the apogee of our second ascent-namely,
3760 metres-our two compasses were insensible; and
that, on our return to the earth, they had recovered
their action, without its having occurred to us to
determine at what height their movement ceased.'
Although at a hundred leagues' distance, the chain
of the Alps was distinctly visible, their peaks gleaming
in the sunlight. M. Matzneff says that the configura-
tion of these mountains is familiar to him, and that he
clearly recognised the form of Mont Blanc-a remark-
able proof of the extraordinary remoteness at which
objects can be seen from a great height.
Suddenly a number of rapid detonations were
heard, followed by a copious discharge of gas in the
form of gray vapour from the lower part of the balloon,
threatening a double danger. 'Seated,' says the author,
in a corner of the car, I watched all M. Godard's
movements, and scrutinised in anxious silence his
look fixed on the valve; and reading there nothing
reassuring, I comprehended that we had to contend
with an unknown enemy, revealed to us by the dis-
charge of gas, which threatened to suffocate us. The
aëronaut, notwithstanding his courage and experience,
hesitated alike on the nature of the peril and on the
means of combating it: I then considered myself as
lost..... At length M. Godard, overcoming his hesi-

tation, pulled the cord of the valve hastily: immediately disquieted at this vertical flight, we aided it as much
the gas ceased to envelop us-we were saved.
as possible by throwing out ballast.'
The anxieties I had undergone were forgotten
as soon as I saw the interior of the balloon again
become transparent. The sun rose higher, the heat
gradually increased, the gas dilated, and under this
natural action the balloon ascended. The thermometer
marked seven degrees above zero, and then fell to the
same temperature as at our departure from Soissons
two and a half hours before. At length, at thirty-seven
minutes after five the balloon ceased to mount, remained
stationary a few moments, and began to descend of
itself. We traversed a cloud; it was an odd sensation,
known by those who have climbed high mountains.
We were wet to the skin, although there was no rain.'
The balloon descended in a wheat-field at a quarter
past six, near to the village of Cliron, and about two
leagues from Méziéres, and eighty-six miles from
Soissons. M. Godard, desirous of gratifying the
inhabitants of Méziéres with a sight of the balloon,
engaged a party of labourers to tow it to the town--a
task of much difficulty, as the road, bordered by trees,
was scarcely wide enough to admit the passage of the
huge machine. It had been determined to empty the
balloon and return to Paris, but on inquiry it was found
that the nearest railway station was at Epernay, thirty
leagues off; and the prospect of so tedious a journey
led M. Godard to propose continuing the balloon
voyage into Belgium, where they might more readily
find prompt means of return to Paris.
No sooner said than done. Here M. Matzneff
continues: 'Although the weather was beautiful, the
intensity of the wind would necessarily increase with
the elevation of the sun above the horizon, and M.
Godard apprehended that we should have considerable
difficulty in effecting our third descent; but we were
still under the empire of enthusiasm. We started,
after receiving a memorandum from the mayor of
Cliron, certifying our visit to his commune and the hour
of our departure: it was then ten minutes past eight.
We rose very rapidly; the thermometer shewed seven-
teen degrees above zero. We again saw the Alps, less
brilliant than at the rising of the sun. All at once a
curtain of clouds hid the earth, and we travelled at a
venture, not knowing whither the wind was carrying us.
In fact, in spite of the assurances we had received from
M. le Maire, whose atmospheric appreciations were
somewhat defective, we were sailing direct for Prussia.
While we looked down from our winged observatory on
the clouds moving with the same rapidity as ourselves,
we had a very curious effect of mirage. Between the
azure and the clouds we saw a balloon which followed
us: it had the same form and proportions as our
own, of which it was the vivid and airy reflection. A
blast of wind, dispersing the clouds, made the vision
disappear, and bore us across the Belgian frontier.
Our charmed sight embraced at the same time the
three adjoining countries-Prussia, France, and Belgium.
We gazed with avidity on a panorama without a
frame, and our looks lingered on the picturesque spots
which presented themselves as we passed. Along the
rivers, upon the heights we remarked numerous towns,
varying with their gray tints the continuous green of
the landscape. Long lines, straight or broken, represent
the roads and rivers, so multiplied in this rich and
cultivated country. We could follow distinctly the
course of the Meuse, and distinguish the city and
bridge of Namur, but soon the perspective grew con-
fused, presenting only vague lines and forms without
precision. The Alps with toothed summits reappeared
at our right; and at the same moment we saw the
Vosges, which seemed to continue the icy mountain-
chain. Still we rose. The progressive expansion of
the gas produced by the diminution of atmospheric
pressure and by its dilatation under the intensity of
the solar rays, impelled us upwards. Far from being
|
Again the alarming detonations of the earlier morn-
ing were heard, causing the same painful anxiety; it
was found, however, that they were produced by the
sudden swelling outwards of the sides of the balloon
against the net after having been pressed inwards by
flaws of wind. At this time-forty minutes past nine
- the greatest elevation was reached-6340 metres
(20-800)—and the thermometer stood at three degrees
below zero.
'M. Godard told me,' resumes the narrator, 'that in
none of his ascents had he ever experienced anything
similar to that which we then felt he and his brother
were seized with a painful sickness. Under the weight
of this oppression we became, as it were, deaf, and this
condition was rendered more sensible by the absolute
silence which surrounded us. I was aware of my
own deafness, as I could no longer hear my voice or
that of my companions, while a loud buzzing in the
ears inconvenienced me greatly. We wished again to
consult the compass; but, as on the former occasion, it
was inactive. We saw the plains of Belgium traced
with lines of railway and highway that seemed con-
fusedly interlaced. Over this point we remained
stationary for half an hour: my pulse beat ninety-
eight to the minute; our throats were dry, breathing
difficult, and an excessive drowsiness weighed us
down, and we were obliged frequently to stand up to
avoid giving way to it. M. Godard, junior, wrapped
himself up, and lying down at the bottom of the car,
slept as tranquilly as if he had been in his bed. The
elder wished to do the same, and to leave me in charge
of the balloon, with instructions to wake him only
when it should begin to descend. I energetically
opposed this proof of confidence, feeling myself incap-
able of undertaking such a responsibility, and replacing
even for a moment two men, one of whom was then
performing his thirty-fourth, the other his eighty-fifth
aërial voyage. We therefore mutually resolved to keep
each other awake.
'Towards ten o'clock the balloon began to descend
rapidly, and then stopped at a height of 1000 metres-
about the level of the clouds.' By an escape of gas a
farther descent was effected, and preparations were made
for the final stage. For the first time we lost our pre-
sence of mind; we forgot the benches fitted to our car:
relieved of their weight the balloon would have carried
us farther, and to a favourable ground. We were
forced, in spite of ourselves, to yield to the falling
movement, which we checked as much as possible. M.
Godard the younger began to slack away the grappling-
iron; but instead of uncoiling gradually, it escaped,
and fell suddenly to the extent of forty metres, giving
us a terrible shock. The other cord of 150 metres,
which suffices generally, by its friction against the
asperities of the soil, to diminish the horizontal motion
and neutralise the effect of the wind, was almost useless,
for the peasants who came running after us, under-
standing neither French nor German, were afraid to
seize the cord and drag us downwards. Sometimes we
neared the earth, at others we rose again, the danger
augmenting at each shock, which became more and
more violent. My instruments fell out
another: we approached a narrow gorge, and I foresaw
the tearing of the balloon, and its downfall with
ourselves on the points of the rocks beneath us.
one after
"M.de Matzneff, descend if you will," said M. Godard
with a troubled voice-we were at a height of about
thirty metres-"make yourself fast in the same way
as I, and let us slide down the cord, if you can count
upon your strength."

ceeded in reaching the earth without accident. The
rustics questioned us all at once in their Flemish idiom,
and we tried to make them aware of the urgency of
the service we required of them. The car in which
M. Godard, junior, still remained was to be brought
down: relieved of our weight, it was again ready for
a spring; and the ascensional power of the Eagle was
such that it lifted us from the earth. The burgomaster
of the commune of Fosse and his deputy, who arrived
at this moment, seized the cords of which the peasants
had let go; but all our united efforts were insufficient to
retain the balloon, which plunged onwards continually,
dragging us after it, notwithstanding that the valve
was open. To complete our misfortune, the bottom
of the car partly gave way; the position of the young
man became terrible; we saw him clinging to the cords,
rudely tossed about, and with scarcely any support for
his feet. A violent blast tore the balloon suddenly
from our grasp, it followed the curve of the narrow
pass in which we were entangled, and disappeared.
M. Godard uttered a cry of despair: "My brother is
lost!" he exclaimed, and ran blindly in pursuit. I
endeavoured to follow, but lost his track in the middle
of the ravine. Not knowing what direction to take, I
stopped breathless at the door of a cabin, waiting with
painful anxiety the result of this catastrophe. Frag-
ments of our broken apparatus were brought to me
every minute, but no news of my unlucky companions.
At length, after an hour's delay, I learned from a
pedler passing by that the aëronauts had gained posses-
sion of the balloon at about two miles' distance, and
were engaged in emptying it. I ran in the direction
indicated, and coming up soon with my friends, we
exchanged congratulations on the termination of the
adventure.'
The total distance travelled in six hours and a half
of aërostation was 130 leagues, or 340 miles. From
Basse Bodeux, where the balloon descended, the party
made their way to Spa, whence they found means to
return to Paris. M. Matzneff adds to his narrative a
table of his observations on the temperature of the diffe-
rent strata of the atmosphere through which he passed
in his several ascents. These were previously submitted
to the scrutiny of M. Babinet, an eminent member of the
Academy of Sciences, and compared with the readings
of the instruments taken at the same time in the
observatory at Paris. I advise you,' writes M. Babinet
to the author, to publish all your observations, regard-

same balloon, and without renewal of the gas, gives

built of turf or rough stones, and generally thatched with
broom or straw. It has a door, and a small square open-
ing closed by a board in place of a window. The interior
displays the most brilliant ebony hue, and is painted by
the hand of no common artist. A chimney and fire-
place are luxuries unthought of; the fire is lighted on the
floor, and an opening in the roof, at one end of the dwell-
ing, is deemed quite sufficient for the egress of the smoke.
If all is quiet without, it generally finds its way; but
otherwise, it would be perhaps better to submit to the
consequences of a heavy shower outside, than run the
risk of having the eyes irritated, and the breathing
embarrassed, by the smoke within. In such a place
luxury in furniture is not to be looked for, the principal
items usually being a heather-bed, a sinall wooden forin,
a turf-built sofa by the fire, termed a sunk, a little ineal-
girnel, an iron pot, a tin flagon, one or more wooden
dishes called caps, and several horn-spoons. The food
generally used by the shepherds is what in Scotland is
known by the name of brose, which is made by pouring
boiling water upon oatmeal, with a little salt, then gently
stirring with a spoon, and qualifying with butter or milk,
as either may be obtained. The fuel used for boiling the
water is either peats or birns-the withered stems of heath
and the pot is suspended over the fire by a chain froin
an iron spike fixed in the wall. Cheese and bread are also
partaken of, but chiefly during their long and fatiguing
rambles round the mountain-riggins.-Gardiner's Flora

TO MY CANARY IN HIS CAGE.
SING away, ay, sing away,
Bonnie little bird!
Sing, with patient soul and gay,
Though a woodland roundelay
You have never heard;
Though your life from youth to age
Passes in a narrow cage.
Near the window wild birds fly,
Trees and flowers are round:
Fair things everywhere you spy
Through the glass-pane's mystery-
Your horizon's bound:
Nothing hinders your desire
But a little gilded wire.
Like a human soul you seem,
Shut in golden bars;
Placed amid earth's sunshine-stream,
Singing to the morning-beam,
Dreaming 'neath the stars:
Seeing all life's pleasures clear—
But they never can come near!
Never-Sing, bird -poet mine,
As most poets do--
Guessing with an instinct fine
Of some happiness divine
Which they never knew:
Lonely in a prison bright,
Hymning for the world's delight.
Yet, my birdie, you're content
In your tiny cage;
Not a carol thence is sent
But for happiness is meant-
Wisdom sweet and sage!
Teaching, the true poet's part
Is to sing with merry heart.
So, lie down thou peevish pen !
Eyes, smile off all tears;
And, my wee bird, sing again;
I'll translate your song to men
In these coming years:
'Howsoe'er thy lot's assigned,
Bear it with a cheerful mind.'
HINT ABOUT INKSTANDS.
A safe inkstand, and convenient establishment for

the natural, quiet use of ink, but its unnatural locomo-

ment, and no one can run about with its appurtenances
without constant risk and occasional damage. These
appurtenances are likewise so cheap and commodious
now-a-days, and their use so frequent, since the penny-

should not begrudge some attention to its requisitions.—

SHOW-PLACES.
In our working - day world' an important discovery
has been made of late years-forced on perhaps by the
very severity of our industrial application: it is, that
the occasional holiday, spent in a rational manner, is
an indispensable requisite for the preservation of a
healthy tone of both body and mind. We have accord-
ingly seen the increased facilities for locomotion for
which our age is remarkable, taken advantage of to
a great extent, for the means of making little day-
excursions to such places as may be within reach,
attractive from their natural beauty or any other
cause. The show - place has thus risen greatly in
importance in these times.
Now, show-places are of various kinds. Sometimes
they are merely fine houses with pretty parks-some-
times a beautiful piece of lake-scenery-sometimes a
quiet old hall or castle, of historic notability, but still
occupied by a gentleman's family. In these cases, the
liberty to wander about and see what is to be seen is
all that can be desired; and where this has to be
sought from a proprietor, and is readily granted, the
public has only to conduct itself inoffensively and
express its gratitude, and it leaves us no more to say.
There are, however, some show-places of a more
important character, as a royal palace like Windsor or
Hampton Court, full of beautiful works of art, that are
worthy of careful study, or of portraits that illustrate
the pages of history-or a middle-age baronial castle,
like Warwick or Raby, which in an hour will give us a
far more vivid idea of how the men of those days lived,
than we can get from any books whatever-or a
museum full of objects of natural history, or of the
implements, arms, and bijouterie of ancient times. In
such cases the public requires to be guided from
object to object, and instructed in the character and
history of each, and in the bearing of the whole, in
order that it may have any true enjoyment of what it
sees, or come away benefited by the sight. It may be
in many instances sadly ill-prepared for the informa-
tion it receives; but this is nothing to the purpose.
We are bound to presume that a vast proportion of our
holiday excursionists are reading and reflecting people,
who can appreciate the objects which they see, and
understand what they hear related. It will at the very
least be admitted that any exposition which is afforded
to the public respecting the places in question ought
to be correct so far as it goes, and not calculated to
confuse or mislead.
But what is the fact? We fear it stands simply
thus: that the show-places of the very highest interest,
and even those which may be described as of national
PRICE 14d.
importance, are, with scarcely an exception, under the
care of mere domestics. If we go to Windsor, we are
received by some of the Queen's servants-very civil
persons, it must be admitted, but yet not at all the
guides we would desire through the ancient halls of
the Edwards, the Henries, and the Charleses. There
is enough upon the walls to excite a deep interest in
any man even acquainted to the most moderate extent
with the history of England. How disappointing to
have it expounded by one who, although certainly a
servant of a high class, and perhaps well selected for
the purpose, considering the class to which she belongs,
still is by education a servant, and nothing more! If
we go to see the apartments of Queen Mary at Holy-
rood-a curiosity quite unique, and invested with
historic associations of the deepest interest-we are
taken in charge by a lady-like person of the character
of a housekeeper, who, having received no right instruc-
tion as to the facts connected with the place, tells us a
number of tales which are only fit for the nursery,
and a mockery of the intelligence of the age. So far
from being a guidance or a help, this old lady only
mars our enjoyment of those mouldering halls. With
such knowledge as we may have got from Robertson
or Tytler, we could easily make out the whole story
for ourselves, even to the bloody spot where Riccio lay
pierced with his fifty-six wounds for the whole of a
March night-it would be a high treat merely to walk
quietly through the rooms, and think over the sad
history which they saw enacted. But no; we have
to see a set of fictitious portraits, and examine the first
fire-grate ever used in Scotland, and hear a Cromwellian
trooper's breast- plate and jack - boots described as
accoutrements of King Henry Darnley, to the complete
discomfiture of all our meditations. A person of superior
education would know that all these things were only
grandam's tales, and spare us. Visitors are afterwards
taken to other parts of the palace by females far less
endurable than our good old friend above described.
In short, the exhibition of this curious place, so full
of romantic associations, is on a footing which we
cannot help thinking discreditable to the conductors of
public affairs. Shewn by a really intelligent person,
the thousands of persons who see it every week in
summer would go away not merely gratified, but
instructed; whereas, under present arrangements, they
must all of them retire dissatisfied, if not disgusted,
and with their ideas of history, such as they are, per-
verted. It is, unfortunately, but a specimen of the
show-places of the country generally.
While performing their function so unsatisfactorily,
these exhibiters and exhibitresses often derive from
the bounty of strangers a ridiculously large income.

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL,
A few years ago the housekeeper at a certain noble-
man's seat in the west of England, remarkable for the
numberless articles of virtù contained in it, was under-
stood to receive as much as would amply remunerate
a couple of dignified clergymen and three or four
curates. The gatherings at Abbotsford were believed
about the same time to equal the average income of a
professor in the Edinburgh university, or of the editor
of a first-class provincial newspaper. Such facts need
no comment.
The largeness of these incomes, however, proves
that there is no want of a disposition on the part of the
public to remunerate the attendants at show-places
liberally. This is a fact worth keeping in view.
On the continent there is a very different class of
ciceroni established in the principal places resorted to
by strangers. One often finds there a well-educated
and gentleman-like man, fully competent to describe
in a clear and intelligent manner everything he has to
shew. Such is the custode of the Château Rosenberg
at Copenhagen, where the antiquities of the royal
family are kept; such is he of the historical museum
of Dresden; such he of the celebrated Green Vaults of
the same city. What these gentlemen tell is exactly
what would be found in a respectable historical cata-
logue. You feel from the precision as to persons and
dates that it may be depended upon every word of it.
It is also told in a well-bred manner, and with the
unction of an amateur, so as greatly to enhance your
interest in the objects. The great museums of Germany
and Italy are all under the care of such enlightened
persons; and these men perform their duties in per-
son as far as possible. At a second-rate town in
Northern Italy-that of Brescia-the stranger going
to see the museum established there amidst the ruins
of a fine Roman temple, which was discovered a
few years since, experiences a most delightful surprise
when he finds that the venerable but unpretending old
man who conducts him through the curiosities is
actually the respected antiquarian scholar who was the
means of discovering and disinterring the temple. It
is quite a novelty to an Englishman to find so much
intelligence both in these stationary ciceroni, as they
may be called, and in many of those who undertake to
conduct him from place to place in the large cities,
Though it is almost invidious to indicate particular
persons where so many are meritorious, we cannot help
stating that Mr Schmidt, who lately conducted us
through Berlin and Potsdam, and a certain youth
named Alessandro, who acted as our valet-de-place in
Venice, displayed a higher and more accurate intel-
ligence than is found even amongst literary men
conversant with such subjects in this country. We
mention these things as shewing that there is a high
standard amongst men of this class on the continent.
It occurs to us, as a thing desirable in our day,
when resorting to show-places has become a luxury,
nay a necessary to so many, that we should endeavour
to put them upon a footing somewhat on a par with
that which they present on the continent. Con-
sidering the liberality of the public at show-places, we
do not see that there can be any obstacle of the kind
which hinders so many good works-namely, in respect
of funds. Why should not a place of the consequence
of Holyrood Palace be put under the custodiership of
an intelligent person, who would describe its various
storied galleries and bloodstained chambers with a
correct reference to facts, and with the feeling of a
gentleman? Such a function might be not unworthy
of even literary men of some degree of repute. Were
the usual continental plan followed, of a certain respec-
table fee for each group of persons not exceeding a
certain moderate number (it is 6s. 9d. at the Château
Rosenberg for twelve or any smaller number of per-
sons), the delicacy of the gentleman exhibiter would be
sufficiently preserved. To many men of letters who
have failed by their pens to work out an independence
for their old age such an office might be a succour
much to be rejoiced in. We can imagine it a capital
resource, in particular, for the whole of that large and
respectable class of literary men who devote themselves
to the investigation of local antiquities. Give one of
this class a respectable subsistence from the perform-
ance of a public duty occupying him for three or four
hours each forenoon, and he may be enabled to use the
rest of his working-day in antiquarian investigation or
in the treatment of historical subjects with his pen.
Relieved from the primary cares of life, he would
pursue his proper tasks with a spirit and freedom
unknown to him who has to study how in the first
place to make his pen profitable for the obtaining of
bread. For show-places containing works of art, it
might be most suitable to employ artists; and for
many artists it would be equally suitable to have such
situations. As to the dignity of the office, we would
say, shew us respectable men filling it, and it can no
longer be held as mean. Our ideas of ciceroneship
can no longer be what they have been. It is a duty
of more consequence than it used to be to the public.
There is a need and a craving for its being performed
in a superior manner. Let it be thus performed, and
the public will respect those who so much gratify
it, whether they have any farther claims to respect
or not.
We would press these remarks on the attention of
the authorities who rule such matters. Our sugges-
tion will not, we hope, be the less acceptable that it
involves a possible benefit to the literary class. It is
part of the plan of the Literary Guild that the veterans
receiving its patronage should do something in the way
of lecturing in requital. Might they not be adapted
to a more useful purpose if employed as a Band of
Gentlemen Ciceroni in the places rendered attractive
by historical and poetical association and by objects
of taste? In the one case, we should have them inter-
fering with the labours of the existing class of lecturers,
and perhaps thrusting these persons out of a means
of subsistence. In the other, we should have them
displacing a set of domestics from situations for which
they are obviously unfit, and who have more suitable
functions to fall back upon.
RECOLLECTIONS OF A POLICE-OFFICER.
FLINT JACKSON.
FARNHAM hops are world-famous, or at least famous in
that huge portion of the world where English ale is
drunk, and whereon, I have a thousand times heard and
read, the sun never sets. The name, therefore, of the
pleasant Surrey village, in and about which the events
I am about to relate occurred, is, I may fairly presume,
known to many of my readers. I was ordered to
Farnham, to investigate a case of burglary, committed
in the house of a gentleman of the name of Hursley,
during the temporary absence of the family, which had
completely nonplussed the unpractised Dogberrys of
the place, albeit it was not a riddle at all difficult to
read. The premises, it was quickly plain to me, had
been broken, not into, but out of; and a watch being
set upon the motions of the very specious and clever
person left in charge of the house and property, it was
speedily discovered that the robbery had been effected
by herself and a confederate of the name of Dawkins,
her brother-in-law. Some of the stolen goods were found
secreted at his lodgings; but the most valuable portion,
consisting of plate, and a small quantity of jewellery, had
disappeared: it had questionless been converted into
money, as considerable sums, in sovereigns, were found
upon both Dawkins and the woman, Sarah Purday.
Now, as it had been clearly ascertained that neither of
the prisoners had left Farnham since the burglary, it
was manifest there was a receiver near at hand who

There was no need for over-hurrying the business, as
the prisoners were committed to the Surrey Spring
Assizes, and it was now the season of the hop-harvest
-a delightful and hilarious period about Farnham
when the weather is fine and the yield abundant. I,
however, lost no time in making diligent and minute
inquiry as to the character and habits of Jackson,
and the result was a full conviction that nothing but the
fear of being denounced as an accomplice could have
self to charges in defence of the imprisoned burglars.
One afternoon, whilst pondering the matter, and at
the same time enjoying the prettiest and cheerfulest
of rural sights, that of hop-picking, the apothecary at
whose house I was lodging - we will call him Mr
Morgan; he was a Welshman-tapped me suddenly on
the shoulder, and looking sharply round, I perceived he
had something he deemed of importance to communicate.
'What is it?' I said quickly.
-
had purchased the missing articles. Dawkins and
Purday were, however, dumb as stones upon the subject;
and nothing occurred to point suspicion till early in
the evening previous to the second examination of the
prisoners before the magistrates, when Sarah Purday
asked for pen, ink, and paper for the purpose of writing
to one Mr Jackson, in whose service she had formerly
lived. I happened to be at the prison, and of course
took the liberty of carefully unsealing her note and
reading it. It revealed nothing; and save by its ex-induced such a miserly, iron-hearted rogue to put him-
tremely cautious wording, and abrupt peremptory tone,
coming from a servant to her former master, suggested
nothing. I had carefully reckoned the number of
sheets of paper sent into the cell, and now on recounting
them found that three were missing. The turnkey
returned immediately, and asked for the two other
letters she had written. The woman denied having
written any other, and for proof pointed to the torn
fragments of the missing sheets lying on the floor.
These were gathered up and brought to me, but I could
make nothing out of them, every word having been
carefully run through with the pen, and converted into
an unintelligible blot. The request contained in the
actually-written letter was one simple enough in itself,
merely, that Mr Jackson would not on any account
fail to provide her, in consideration of past services,
with legal assistance on the morrow.' The first nine
words were strongly underlined; and I made out after
a good deal of trouble that the word 'pretence' had
been partially effaced, and account' substituted for it.
'She need not have wasted three sheets of paper upon
such a nonsensical request as that,' observed the turnkey.
'Old Jackson wouldn't shell out sixpence to save her
or anybody else from the gallows.'
'I am of a different opinion; but tell me, what sort
of a person is this former master of hers?'
'All I know about him is that he's a cross-grained,
old curmudgeon, living about a mile out of Farnham,
who scrapes money together by lending small sums
upon notes-of-hand at short dates, and at a thundering
interest. Flint Jackson folk about here call him.'
At all events, forward the letter at once, and to-mor-
row we shall see what we shall see. Good-evening.'
It turned out as I anticipated. A few minutes after
the prisoners were brought into the justice-room, a
Guilford solicitor of much local celebrity arrived, and
announced that he appeared for both the inculpated
parties. He was allowed a private conference with
them, at the close of which he stated that his clients
would reserve their defence. They were at once com-
mitted for trial, and I overheard the solicitor assure the
woman that the ablest counsel on the circuit would
be retained in their behalf.
I had no longer a doubt that it was my duty to know
something further of this suddenly - generous Flint
Jackson, though how to set about it was a matter of
considerable difficulty. There was no legal pretence
for a search-warrant, and I doubted the prudence of
proceeding upon my own responsibility with so astute
an old fox as Jackson was represented to be; for,
supposing him to be a confederate with the burglars,
he had by this time in all probability sent the stolen
property away - to London in all likelihood; and
should I find nothing, the consequences of ransacking
his house merely because he had provided a former
servant with legal assistance would be serious. Under
these circumstances I wrote to headquarters for in-
structions, and by return of post received orders to
prosecute the inquiry thoroughly, but cautiously, and
to consider time as nothing so long as there appeared
a chance of fixing Jackson with the guilt of receiving
the plunder. Another suspicious circumstance that I
have omitted to notice in its place was that the Guil-
ford solicitor tendered bail for the prisoners to any
reasonable amount, and named Enoch Jackson as one
of the securities. Bail was, however, refused.
'The oddest thing in the world. There's Flint
Jackson, his deaf old woman, and the young people
lodging with him, all drinking and boozing away at
yon alehouse.'
'Shew them to me, if you please.'
A few minutes brought us to the place of boisterous
entertainment, the lower room of which was suffo-
catingly full of tipplers and tobacco-smoke. We never-
theless contrived to edge ourselves in; and my
companion stealthily pointed out the group, who were
seated together near the farther window, and then left
me to myself.
The appearance of Jackson entirely answered to the
popular prefix of Flint attached to his name.
He was
a wiry, gnarled, heavy-browed, iron-jawed fellow of
about sixty, with deep-set eyes aglow with sinister
and greedy instincts. His wife, older than he, and so
deaf apparently as the door of a dungeon, wore a sim
pering, imbecile look of wonderment, it seemed to me,
at the presence of such unusual and abundant cheer.
The young people, who lodged with Jackson, were
really a very frank, honest, good-looking couple, though
not then appearing to advantage-the countenance of
Henry Rogers being flushed and inflamed with drink,
and that of his wife's clouded with frowns, at the
situation in which she found herself, and the riotous
conduct of her husband. Their brief history was this:---
They had both been servants in a family living not
far distant from Farnham-Sir Thomas Lethbridge's,
I understood-when about three or four months previous
to the present time Flint Jackson, who had once been
in an attorney's office, discovered that Henry Rogers,
in consequence of the death of a distant relative
in London, was entitled to property worth something
like L.1500. There were, however, some law-difficul-
ties in the way, which Jackson offered, if the business
was placed in his hands, to overcome for a considera-
tion, and in the meantime to supply board and lodging
and such necessary sums of money as Henry Rogers
might require. With this brilliant prospect in view
service became at once utterly distasteful. The fortunate
legatee had for some time courted Mary Elkins, one of
the ladies' maids, a pretty, bright-eyed brunette; and
they were both united in the bonds of holy matrimony
on the very day the warnings' they had given expired.
Since then they had lived at Jackson's house in daily
expectation of their 'fortune,' with which they proposed
to start in the public line.
Finding myself unrecognised, I called boldly for a
pot and a pipe, and after some manoeuvring contrived
to seat myself within ear-shot of Jackson and his party.
They presented a strange study. Henry Rogers was
boisterously excited, and not only drinking freely him-
self, but treating a dozen fellows round him, the cost of
which he from time to time called upon 'Old Flint,' as
he courteously styled his ancient friend, to discharge.
'Come, fork out, Old Flint!' he cried again and

again. It'll be all right, you know, in a day or two,
and a few halfpence over. Shell out, old fellow! What
signifies, so you're happy?'
6
Jackson complied with an affectation of acquiescent
gaiety ludicrous to behold. It was evident that each
successive pull at his purse was like wrenching a tooth
out of his head, and yet while the dismalest of smiles
wrinkled his wolfish mouth, he kept exclaiming: A
fine lad-a fine lad! generous as a prince-generous
as a prince! Good Lord, another round! He minds
money no more than as if gold was as plentiful as
gravel! But a fine generous lad for all that!'
Jackson, I perceived, drank considerably, as if incited
thereto by compressed savageness. The pretty young
wife would not taste a drop, but tears frequently filled
her eyes, and bitterness pointed her words as she vainly
implored her husband to leave the place and go home
with her. To all her remonstrances the maudlin
drunkard replied only by foolery, varied occasionally by
an attempt at a line or two of the song of 'The Thorn.'
'But you will plant thorns, Henry,' rejoined the
provoked wife in a louder and angrier tone than she
ought perhaps to have used-' not only in my bosom, but
your own, if you go on in this sottish, disgraceful way.'
'Always quarrelling, always quarrelling!' remarked
Jackson, pointedly, towards the bystanders-' always
quarrelling!'
'Who is always quarrelling?' demanded the young
wife sharply. 'Do you mean me and Henry?'
'I was only saying, my dear, that you don't like
your husband to be so generous and free-hearted
that's all,' replied Jackson, with a confidential wink at
the persons near him.
'Free-hearted and generous! Fool-hearted and
crazy, you mean!' rejoined the wife, who was much
excited. 'And you ought to be ashamed of yourself to
give him money for such brutish purposes.'
6
Always quarrelling, always quarrelling!' iterated
Jackson, but this time unheard by Mrs Rogers
'always, perpetually quarrelling!'
-
I could not quite comprehend all this. If so large
a sum as L.1500 was really coming to the young man,
why should Jackson wince as he did at disbursing
small amounts which he could repay himself with
abundant interest? If otherwise-and it was probable
he should not be repaid- what meant his eternal,
'fine generous lad!' 'spirited young man!' and
so on? What, above all, meant that look of diabolical
hate which shot out from his cavernous eyes towards
Henry Rogers when he thought himself unobserved,
just after satisfying a fresh claim on his purse? Much
practice in reading the faces and deportment of such
men made it pretty clear to me that Jackson's course
of action respecting the young man and his money
was not yet decided upon in his own mind; that he was
still perplexed and irresolute; and hence the apparent
contradiction in his words and acts.
Henry Rogers at length dropped asleep with his head
upon one of the settle tables; Jackson sank into
sullen silence; the noisy room grew quiet; and I came
away.
I was impressed with a belief that Jackson enter-
tained some sinister design against his youthful and
inexperienced lodgers, and I determined to acquaint
them with my suspicions. For this purpose Mr
Morgan, who had a patient living near Jackson's house,
undertook to invite them to tea on some early evening,
on the pretence that he had heard of a tavern that
might suit them when they should receive their
fortune. Let me confess, too, that I had another
design besides putting the young people on their guard
against Jackson. I thought it very probable that it
would not be difficult to glean from them some inte-
resting and suggestive particulars concerning the ways,
means, practices, outgoings and incomings, of their
worthy landlord's household.
Four more days passed unprofitably away, and I
was becoming weary of the business, when about five
o'clock in the afternoon the apothecary galloped up to
his door on a borrowed horse, jumped off with surpris-
ing celerity, and with a face as white as his own
magnesia, burst out as he hurried into the room where
I was sitting: 'Here's a pretty kettle of fish! Henry
Rogers has been poisoned, and by his wife!'
'Poisoned!'
'Yes, poisoned; although, thanks to my being on
the spot, I think he will recover. But I must instantly
to Dr Edwards: I will tell you all when I return.'
The promised'all' was this: Morgan was passing
slowly by Jackson's house, in the hope of seeing either
Mr or Mrs Rogers, when the servant - woman, Jane
Riddet, ran out and begged him to come in, as their
lodger had been taken suddenly ill. Ill indeed! The
surface of his body was cold as death, and the apothe-
cary quickly discovered that he had been poisoned
with sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol), a quantity of which
he, Morgan, had sold a few days previously to Mrs
Rogers, who, when purchasing it, said Mr Jackson
wanted it to apply to some warts that annoyed him.
Morgan fortunately knew the proper remedy, and
desired Jackson, who was in the room, and seemingly
very anxious and flurried, to bring some soap instantly,
a solution of which he proposed to give immediately
to the seemingly dying man. The woman-servant was
gone to find Mrs Rogers, who had left about ten
minutes before, having first made the tea in which the
poison had been taken. Jackson hurried out of the
apartment, but was gone so long that Morgan, becoming
impatient, scraped a quantity of plaster off the wall,
and administered it with the best effect. At last
Jackson came back, and said there was unfortunately
not a particle of soap in the house. A few minutes
afterwards the young wife, alarmed at the woman-
servant's tidings, flew into the room in an agony of
alarm and grief. Simulated alarm, crocodile grief,
Mr Morgan said; for there could, in his opinion, be no
doubt that she had attempted to destroy her husband.
Mr Jackson, on being questioned, peremptorily denied
that he had ever desired Mrs Rogers to procure sul-
phuric acid for him, or had received any from her-a
statement which so confounded the young woman that
she instantly fainted. The upshot was that Mrs
Rogers was taken into custody and lodged in prison.
This terrible news flew through Farnham like wild-
fire. In a few minutes it was upon everybody's
tongue: the hints of the quarrelsome life the young
couple led, artfully spread by Jackson, were recalled,
and no doubt appeared to be entertained of the truth
of the dreadful charge. I had no doubt either, but my
conviction was not that of the Farnham folk. This,
then, was the solution of the struggle I had seen going
on in Jackson's mind; this the realisation of the dark
thought which I had imperfectly read in the sinister
glances of his restless eyes. He had intended to
destroy both the husband and wife-the one by poison,
and the other by the law! Doubtless, then, the
L.1500 had been obtained, and this was the wretched
man's infernal device for retaining it! I went over
with Morgan early the next morning to see the
patient, and found that, thanks to the prompt antidote
administered, and Dr Edwards's subsequent active
treatment, he was rapidly recovering. The still-
suffering young man, I was glad to find, would not
believe for a moment in his wife's guilt. I watched
the looks and movements of Jackson attentively — a
scrutiny which he, now aware of my vocation, by no
means appeared to relish.
6
Pray,' said I, suddenly addressing Riddet, the
woman-servant-pray, how did it happen that you had
no soap in such a house as this yesterday evening?'
'No soap!' echoed the woman with a stare of sur-
prise. 'Why'.

'No-no soap,' hastily broke in her master with loud
and menacing emphasis. 'There was not a morsel in
the house. I bought some afterwards in Farnham.'
The cowed and bewildered woman slunk away. I
was more than satisfied; and judging by Jackson's
countenance, which changed beneath my look to the
colour of the lime-washed wall against which he stood,
he surmised that I was.
My conviction, however, was not evidence, and I felt
that I should need even more than my wonted good-for-
tune to bring the black crime home to the real perpetrator.
For the present, at all events, I must keep silence-a
resolve I found hard to persist in at the examination of
the accused wife, an hour or two afterwards, before the
county magistrates. Jackson had hardened himself
to iron, and gave his lying evidence with ruthless
self-possession. He had not desired Mrs Rogers to
purchase sulphuric acid; had not received any from
her. In addition also to his testimony that she and
her husband were always quarrelling, it was proved by
a respectable person that high words had passed
between them on the evening previous to the day the
criminal offence was committed, and that foolish,
passionate expressions had escaped her about wishing
to be rid of such a drunken wretch. This evidence,
combined with the medical testimony, appeared so
conclusive to the magistrates, that spite of the unfortu-
nate woman's wild protestations of innocence, and the
rending agony which convulsed her frame, and almost
choked her utterance, she was remanded to prison till
that day-week, when, the magistrates informed her,
she would be again brought up for the merely formal
completion of the depositions, and be then fully com-
mitted on the capital charge.
I was greatly disturbed, and walked for two or three
hours about the quiet neighbourhood of Farnham,
revolving a hundred fragments of schemes for bringing
the truth to light, without arriving at any feasible
conclusion. One only mode of procedure seemed to
offer, and that but dimly, a hope of success. It was,
however, the best I could hit upon, and I directed my
steps towards the Farnham prison. Sarah Purday had
not yet, I remembered, been removed to the county jail
at Guilford.
more
'Is Sarah Purday,' I asked the turnkey,
reconciled to her position than she was?'
'She's just the same-bitter as gall, and venomous
as a viper.'
This woman, I should state, was a person of fierce
will and strong passions, and in early life had been
respectably situated.
Just step into her cell,' I continued, 'upon some
excuse or other, and carelessly drop a hint that if she
could prevail upon Jackson to get her brought by
habeas before a judge in London, there could be no
doubt of her being bailed.'
The man stared, but after a few words of pretended
explanation, went off to do as I requested. He was not
long gone.
She's all in a twitteration at the thoughts
of it,' he said; and must have pen, ink, and paper
without a moment's delay, bless her consequence!'
These were supplied; and I was soon in possession of
her letter, couched cautiously, but more peremptorily
than the former one. I need hardly say it did not
reach its destination. She passed the next day in a
state of feverish impatience; and no answer returning,
wrote again, her words this time conveying an evident
though indistinct threat. I refrained from visiting her
till two days had thus passed, and found her, as I
expected, eaten up with fury. She glared at me as I
entered the cell like a chained tigress.
'You appear vexed,' I said, 'no doubt because Jack-
son declines to get you bailed. He ought not to refuse
you such a trifling service, considering all things.'
All what things?' replied the woman, eyeing me
fiercely.
"That you know best, though I have a shrewd guess.'
'What do you guess? and what are you driving
at?'
'I will deal frankly with you, Sarah Purday. In
the first place, you must plainly perceive that your
friend Jackson has cast you off-abandoned you to your
fate; and that fate will, there can be no doubt, be
transportation.'
'Well,' she impatiently snarled, 'suppose so; what
then?'
'This-that you can help yourself in this difficulty
by helping me.'
'As how?'
In the first place, give me the means of convicting
Jackson of having received the stolen property.'
'Ha! How do you know that?'
'Oh, I know it very well-as well almost as you do.
But this is not my chief object; there is another, far
more important one,' and I ran over the incidents
relative to the attempt at poisoning. Now,' I resumed,
tell me, if you will, your opinion on this matter.'
'That it was Jackson administered the poison, and
certainly not the young woman,' she replied with
vengeful promptness.
'My own conviction! This, then, is my proposition:
you are sharp-witted, and know this fellow's ways,
habits, and propensities thoroughly-I, too, have heard
something of them-and it strikes me that you could
suggest some plan, some device grounded on that
knowledge, whereby the truth might come to light.'
The woman looked fixedly at me for some time
without speaking. As I meant fairly and honestly by
her I could bear her gaze without shrinking.
'Supposing I could assist you,' she at last said, 'how
would that help me?'
'It would help you greatly. You would no doubt be
still convicted of the burglary, for the evidence is
irresistible; but if in the meantime you should have
been instrumental in saving the life of an innocent
person, and of bringing a great criminal to justice,
there cannot be a question that the Queen's mercy
would be extended to you, and the punishment be
merely a nominal one.'
'If I were sure of that!' she murmured with a burn-
ing scrutiny in her eyes, which were still fixed upon
my countenance-'if I were sure of that! But you
are misleading me.'
'Believe me, I am not. I speak in perfect sincerity.
Take time to consider the matter. I will look in again
in about an hour; and pray, do not forget that it is
your sole and last chance.'
I left her, and did not return till more than three
hours had passed away. Sarah Purday was pacing
the cell in a frenzy of inquietude.
6
'I thought you had forgotten me. Now,' she con-
tinued with rapid vehemence, tell me, on your word
and honour as a man, do you truly believe that if I
can effectually assist you it will avail me with Her
Majesty ?'
"I am as positive it will as I am of my own life.'
'Well, then, I will assist you. First, then, Jackson
was a confederate with Dawkins and myself, and
received the plate and jewellery, for which he paid us
less than one-third of the value.'
'Rogers and his wife were not, I hope, cognizant of
this?'
'Certainly not; but Jackson's wife and the woman-
servant, Riddet, were. I have been turning the other
business over in my mind,' she continued, speaking
with increasing emotion and rapidity; and oh, believe
me, Mr Waters, if you can, that it is not solely a
selfish motive which induces me to aid in saving Mary
Rogers from destruction. I was once myself– Ah
God!'
Tears welled up to the fierce eyes, but they were
quickly brushed away, and she continued somewhat

more calmly: You have heard, I daresay, that Jack-There were two large high-backed easy-chairs, and I
son has a strange habit of talking in his sleep?'
'I have, and that he once consulted Morgan as to
whether there was any cure for it. It was that which
partly suggested '-
'It is, I believe, a mere fancy of his,' she interrupted;
'or at anyrate the habit is not so frequent, nor what
he says so intelligible, as he thoroughly believes and
fears it, from some former circumstance, to be. His deaf
wife cannot undeceive him, and he takes care never
even to doze except in her presence only.'
This is not, then, so promising as I hoped.'
'Have patience. It is full of promise, as we will
manage. Every evening Jackson frequents a low gamb-
ling-house, where he almost invariably wins small sums
at cards-by craft, no doubt, as he never drinks there.
When he returns home at about ten o'clock, his con-
stant habit is to go into the front-parlour, where his
wife is sure to be sitting at that hour. He carefully
locks the door, helps himself to brandy and water
plentifully of late-and falls asleep in his arm-chair;
and there they both doze away, sometimes till one
o'clock-always till past twelve.'
'Well; but I do not see how '-
'Hear me out, if you please. Jackson never wastes
a candle to drink or sleep by, and at this time of the
year there will be no fire. If he speaks to his wife
he does not expect her, from her wooden deafness, to
answer him. Do you begin to perceive my drift?'
'Upon my word, I do not.'
'What; if upon awaking, Jackson finds that his wife
is Mr Waters, and that Mr Waters relates to him all
that he has disclosed in his sleep: that Mr Hursley's
plate is buried in the garden near the lilac-tree; that
he, Jackson, received a thousand pounds six weeks ago
of Henry Rogers's fortune, and that the money is now
in the recess on the top-landing, the key of which is in
his breast-pocket; that he was the receiver of the plate
stolen from a house in the close at Salisbury a twelve-
month ago, and sold in London for four hundred and fifty
pounds. All this hurled at him,' continued the woman
with wild energy and flashing eyes, what else might
not a bold, quick-witted man make him believe he had
confessed, revealed in his brief sleep?'
6
I had been sitting on a bench; but as these rapid
disclosures burst from her lips, and I saw the use to
which they might be turned, I rose slowly and in some
sort involuntarily to my feet, lifted up, as it were, by
the energy of her fiery words.
'God reward you!' I exclaimed, shaking both her
hands in mine. You have, unless I blunder, rescued
an innocent woman from the scaffold. I see it all.
Farewell!'
'Mr Waters,' she exclaimed, in a changed, palpitating
voice, as I was passing forth; when all is done, you
will not forget me?'
'That I will not, by my own hopes of mercy in the
hereafter. Adieu!'
At a quarter past nine that evening I, accompanied
by two Farnham constables, knocked at the door of
Jackson's house. Henry Rogers, I should state, had
been removed to the village. The door was opened by
the woman - servant, and we went in. 'I have a
warrant for your arrest, Jane Riddet,' I said, 'as an
accomplice in the plate-stealing the other day. There,
don't scream, but listen to me.' I then intimated the
terms upon which alone she could expect favour. She
tremblingly promised compliance; and after placing the
constables outside, in concealment, but within hearing,
I proceeded to the parlour, secured the terrified old
woman, and confined her safely in a distant out-house.
Now, Riddet,' I said, 'quick with one of the old
lady's gowns, a shawl, cap, etcetera. These were
brought, and I returned to the parlour. It was a roomy
apartment, with small, diamond - paned windows, and
just then but very faintly illumined by the star-light.
prepared to take possession of the one recently vacated
by Jackson's wife. You must perfectly understand,"
were my parting words to the trembling servant, 'that
we intend standing no nonsense with either you or
your master. You cannot escape; but if you let Mr
Jackson in as usual, and he enters this room as usual,
no harm will befall you: if otherwise, you will be
unquestionably transported. Now, go.'
My toilet was not so easily accomplished as I thought
it would be. The gown did not meet at the back by
about a foot; that, however, was of little consequence,
as the high chair concealed the deficiency; neither did
the shortness of the sleeves matter much, as the ample
shawl could be made to hide my too great length of
arm; but the skirt was scarcely lower than a High-
lander's, and how the deuce I was to crook my booted
legs up out of view, even in that gloomy starlight, I
could hardly imagine. The cap also was far too small;
still, with an ample kerchief in my hand, my whiskers
might, I thought, be concealed. I was still fidgeting
with these arrangements when Jackson knocked at his
door. The servant admitted him without remark, and
he presently entered the room, carefully locked the
door, and jolted down, so to speak, in the fellow easy-
chair to mine.
He was silent for a few moments, and then he
bawled out: 'She'll swing for it, they say-swing for
it, d'ye hear, dame? But no, of course she don't-deafer
and deafer, deafer and deafer every day. It'll be a
precious good job when the parson says his last prayers
over her as well as others.'
He then got up, and went to a cupboard. I could
hear-for I dared not look up-by the jingling of
glasses and the outpouring of liquids that he was
helping himself to his spirituous sleeping-draughts.
He reseated himself, and drank in moody silence,
except now and then mumbling drowsily to himself,
but in so low a tone that I could make nothing out of
it save an occasional curse or blasphemy. It was
nearly eleven o'clock before the muttered self-com-
muning ceased, and his heavy head sank upon the back
of the easy-chair. He was very restless, and it was
evident that even his sleeping brain laboured with
affrighting and oppressive images; but the mutterings,
as before he slept, were confused and indistinct. At
length-half an hour had perhaps thus passed-the
troubled moanings became for a few moments clearly
audible. Ha-ha-ha!' he burst out, how are you
off for soap? Ho-ho! done there, my boy; ha-ha!
But no-no. Wall-plaster! Who could have thought
it? But for that I—I— What do you stare at me
so for, you infernal blue - bottle? You-you'-
Again the dream-utterance sank into indistinctness,
and I comprehended nothing more.
About half-past twelve o'clock he awoke, rose,
stretched himself, and said: 'Come, dame, let's to
bed; it's getting chilly here.'
'Dame' did not answer, and he again went towards
the cupboard. 'Here's a candle-end will do for us,'
he muttered. A lucifer-match was drawn across the
wall, he lit the candle, and stumbled towards me, for
he was scarcely yet awake. 'Come, dame, come!
Why, thee beest sleeping like a dead un! Wake up,
will thee- Ah! murder! thieves! mur'-
My grasp was on the wretch's throat; but there was
no occasion to use force: he recognised me, and nerve-
less, paralysed, sank on the floor incapable of motion
much less of resistance, and could only gaze in my
face in dumb affright and horror.
'Give me the key of the recess up stairs, which you
carry in your breast-pocket. In your sleep, unhappy
man, you have revealed everything.'
An inarticulate shriek of terror replied to me. I
was silent; and presently he gasped: Wha-at, what
have I said?'

"That Mr Hursley's plate is buried in the garden by
the lilac-tree; that you have received a thousand
pounds belonging to the man you tried to poison; that
you netted four hundred and fifty pounds by the plate
stolen at Salisbury; that you dexterously contrived to
slip the sulphuric acid into the tea unseen by Henry
Rogers's wife.'
The shriek or scream was repeated, and he was for
several moments speechless with consternation. A
ray of hope gleamed suddenly in his flaming eyes. 'It
is true-it is true!' he hurriedly ejaculated; useless
-useless-useless to deny it. But you are alone, and
poor, poor, no doubt. A thousand pounds!-more,
more than that: two thousand pounds in gold-gold,
all in gold-I will give you to spare me, to let me
escape!'
'Where did you hide the soap on the day when you
confess you tried to poison Henry Rogers?'
'In the recess you spoke of. But think! Two
thousand pounds in gold-all in gold'—

As he spoke, I suddenly grasped the villain's hands,
pressed them together, and in another instant the
snapping of a handcuff pronounced my answer.
yell of anguish burst from the miserable man, so loud
and piercing, that the constables outside hurried to
the outer-door, and knocked hastily for admittance.
They were let in by the servant-woman; and in half
an hour afterwards the three prisoners-Jackson, his
wife, and Jane Riddet-were safe in Farnham prison.
A few sentences will conclude this narrative. Mary
Rogers was brought up on the following day, and, on my
evidence, discharged. Her husband, I have heard, has
since proved a better and a wiser man. Jackson was
convicted at the Guilford assize of guiltily receiving
the Hursley plate, and sentenced to transportation for
life. This being so, the graver charge of attempting
to poison was not pressed. There was no moral doubt
of his guilt; but the legal proof of it rested solely on
his own hurried confession, which counsel would no
doubt have contended ought not to be received. His wife
and the servant were leniently dealt with.
Sarah Purday was convicted, and sentenced to trans-
portation. I did not forget my promise; and a statement
of the previously-narrated circumstances having been
drawn up and forwarded to the Queen and the Home
Secretary, a pardon, after some delay, was issued. There
were painful circumstances in her history which, after
strict inquiry, told favourably for her. Several bene-
volent persons interested themselves in her behalf, and
she was sent out to Canada, where she had some
relatives, and has, I believe, prospered there.
This affair caused considerable hubbub at the time,
and much admiration was expressed by the country
people at the boldness and dexterity of the London
'runner;' whereas, in fact, the successful result was
entirely attributable to the opportune revelations of
Sarah Purday.
THE DROLLERIES OF FALSE POLITICAL
ECONOMY.
FIRST ARTICLE.
ONE of the last things which a people learn is to allow
matters of trade and commerce to take their natural
course. Imagining that prosperity may be insured by
certain regulations as to buying and selling, importing
and exporting, manufacturing this and preventing the
manufacture of that-rearing up, as it were, a wholly
factitious system of affairs-they make laws accord-
ingly, and only find out, after doing a world of mischief,
that they had much better have let things alone. Not,
indeed, till the more thoughtful part of the community
has arrived at this conviction, is the fair current of
demand and supply permitted to take its course; and
even at the very last there are individuals who pro-
phesy all sorts of disasters by withdrawing restrictions.
Books could be filled with tales of impoverishment and
ruin, of contests and jealousies, all caused by meddling
to eat and drink, or to dress as they liked. Now that
with the ordinary desires of mankind to buy and sell,
this species of folly is pretty well understood and
laughed at, we propose, for general amusement, to run
over a few of the more remarkable instances of erroneous
political economy, in other countries as well as our
own. They form a strange chapter in the history of
social blunders.
We may begin by mentioning that ancient Rome,
amidst all her glories, had taken care, through sheer
ignorance of right principle, to insure her national
ruin. The plan of prosperity ingeniously contrived by
the Romans consisted in making the colonies they con-
quered find them in food; in which respect they may
be said to have acted the part of a band of robbers, who
lived on the plunder of industrious neighbours. Com-
last for ever. Dishonesty, in its very acts, undermines
mon-sense tells us that practices of this kind cannot
what it rests on. Thinking, however, that they had
laid hold of a capital plan for living in comfort without
labour, they compelled the unfortunate colonists to
supply Rome with a certain tribute in grain. The
state, as well as the great men, thus acquired vast
stores of food, which was distributed gratuitously to
the people. Becoming accustomed to these doles, the
humbler classes did not think of working for a subsist-
ence, and gradually the native soil went out of cultiva-
tion. In a word, agriculture was ruined, independence
of spirit was gone, and abject, corrupt, and impover-
ished, the empire at length sunk under the attacks of
energetic invaders. Such was the political economy of
the ancient Romans, a wonderfully great people in some
things, but utterly ignorant of the mighty truth-that
without well-directed industry the most potent system
must decay and perish.
The sad history of Spain supplies us with perhaps a
still more palpable instance of a great empire being
ruined by unsound political economy. On the accession
of Philip II. in the middle of the sixteenth century,
and during most of his reign, Spain was a great nation.
Her navies swept the seas till their pride was tamed in
which was to snatch from her the sceptre of the seas.
the British Channel by the rising energy of the nation
She had vast possessions stretching over Europe; and
the Indies, as North and South America were called,
were treated as the property of the Spanish crown-a
sort of domain full of incalculable riches to be poured
into the lap of the parent state. It may be said, how-
ever, that it was particularly the possession of the
gold mines of South America that dazzled the eyes of
the government, and made it frantic and foolish with
pride. Political economy teaches us that bullion is but
a commodity like others, which may be a means of
trading and creating riches, but is not in itself riches,
save in so far as it may command other commodities.
A Californian digger, with a lump of gold in his pos-
session, seated on the top of a mountain, and unable
to find his way to a store or any place where he can
exchange it for other objects, is a very poor man in
comparison with the blacksmith at his forge making a
good living with his stock of iron. But the Spanish
government fell into the mistake that bullion was in
itself riches. They deemed it the end for which all
mankind toiled and speculated, bought and sold; and

America to, Spain, paid himself. Selden mentions as
a curious illustration of English law, how a London
merchant got payment of a debt from the king of
Spain. The merchant proceeded against him in the
English courts in the ordinary form, and as the debtor
did not choose to make appearance or plead, the con-
clusive ceremony of outlawry was performed. It
appears that the preliminary step to this denunciation
was an inquiry after the debtor in all neighbouring
alehouses, these being presumed to be the places where
those who owe money do most resort. Selden gives
a ludicrous account of the inquiry at each alehouse if
the king of Spain were there, and the formal return of
form, outlawry was pronounced against him. In the
a universal negative by the officer; whereupon, in usual
end this was found to be no joke. While the sentence
of outlawry stood against him, none of his subjects
could recover debts in the English courts, which were
closed to the whole Spanish nation, and in the end the
London merchant was paid his debt. Mr Dunlop, in his
'Memoirs of Spain,' when describing the state of the
national treasury in the reign of Charles II., says:
reduced, that it was found as difficult to procure fifty
'Such was the inconceivable penury to which it was
ducats as 50,000. Money could thus be no longer raised
for the most pressing occasions, however trifling might
be the cost. Couriers charged with urgent and impor-
tant dispatches on affairs of state, were often unable to
quit Madrid for want of the funds necessary to defray
the immediate expenses of their journeys. Some officers
of the royal household having waited for payment of
what was due to them as long as they could without
absolutely reducing themselves to beggary, peremptorily
demanded their dismission, and were only retained by
force and menaces. All the grooms, however, belonging
to the royal stables who had not received their rations
or wages for two years, contrived to escape from their
service, and the horses remained for some time uncurried
and unfed. A table which had been kept up at the
king's cost for the gentlemen of the bedchamber was
now totally unsupplied, and money was even frequently
wanting to defray the daily expenses of the board of a
monarch who was master of Mexico and Peru! The
household of the queen-mother, which had hitherto
been kept at its full establishment, now began to feel
the effects of the general destitution. The rations pro-
vided for her domestics were withheld; and on lodging
their complaints at court, they were told, with a sort
of Cervantic humour, that the royal coffers were now
all standing open, and they might come to supply
themselves.'
this being within the boundaries of their own territories,
they deemed that there was now no need for them to
toil and speculate, and buy and sell. A decree was
issued prohibiting the exportation of the precious
metals: they were to be kept at home for the enrich-
ment of the country. It had just such an effect as if
an act of parliament were to be passed prohibiting the
exportation of cotton - manufactures and cutlery from
this country. The bullion extracted from the American
mines was just a commodity suitable for trade-not so
profitable a commodity as cotton-manufactures and
cutlery, but still it was the commodity which Spain
especially possessed, and she ought to have sought and
cultivated the means of following out a good trade in
connection with it. Instead of encouraging, her govern-
ment hampered and intercepted her legitimate trade,
and the natural consequences followed. The people
became idle, and, being idle, they became poor, not-
withstanding the gold mines. These, it is true, sent
ever their tribute. Despite of the utmost vigilance of
the government, a considerable portion of it found its
way abroad, much to the relief of the country, which
was subject to a topical plethora of gold. Portions
of this wealth were seized by Drake and the English
cruisers, whose half-piratical captures did little harm
to the people of Spain beyond the humiliation they
inflicted. In fact, the bullion indicated the national
degradation most effectually when it found its way,
as the greater part of it did, to the palaces of the
nobility. Such a contrast of wealth and poverty let us
hope the world may never shew again. A Spanish
noble would possess a sideboard with forty silver
ladders, by which his slaves mounted to carry down
dishes of gold and silver, which would be valued in the
present day at L.40,000 or L.50,000. Yet in the midst
of this grandeur there prevailed squalid misery, rags,
and starvation. On golden dishes there was not a
morsel to eat; the owner was without the means of
buying a dinner; he was as poor in the possession of
bullion which he could not dispose of as an Irish or
Highland landlord with a large estate for which he
receives no rent. It was noted by travellers in Spain
in the seventeenth century that some of these magnifi-
cent grandees could not obtain so humble a product of
foreign industry as a glass-window.
The sources of all wealth are industry and unrestricted
commercial enterprise. Could there be better evidence
of this than the beggarly poverty of a state which pos-
sessed the richest gold-mines in the world?-a poverty
produced by tamperings and restrictions which para-
lysed trade. Of course many inquiries were made as
to the reason why the realm of gold and silver was thus
destitute, while a small republic like Holland, seated in
the mire, was growing rich. Some foreign engineers
proposed to make a great navigable canal to promote
internal trade, but they were answered that Providence
had already provided rivers for that purpose, and they
were doubtless sufficient. This view was a curious
contrast to the notion of the enterprising, restless engi-
neer Brindley, who would not admit that rivers were
of any value except as feeders to navigable canals.
Philip IV.'s government made inquiries into the causes
of the misery and poverty of the nation, and desired
counsel from the governors of provinces and others as
to a suitable remedy. One man named Leruela sug-
gested a plan founded on the view that, notwithstanding
the riches of the American mines, the people were still
in some degree doomed to labour, especially in the pro-
duction of food. To relieve them as much as possible
from the exhaustion of labour, it was proposed that
The public treasury of Spain was like the grandees'
houses. Abundance of bullion was there about the
court, but no money in the royal coffers to keep up the
army and navy, and pay the debts of the state. It
was not difficult to compel the mines to yield gold
enough to make the palace glitter, but it was impos-
sible to draw wealth from an idle people. The shifts
of the kings of Spain to avoid paying their debts are
almost as ludicrous as those of Beau Brummell. The
electors of Brandenburg, the ancestors of the kings of
Prussia, were always somewhat renowned for the
keenness with which they looked after their pecuniary
interests. Among a crowd of creditors who from
morning to night beset the court of Charles II., the
elector's representative was the most importunate, and
it was desirable to get rid of him. He was told that a
cargo of bullion was to arrive from America at Seville,
and received an order for payment of his claim on the
municipality of that city. Away went the ambassador,
but in the meantime a counter-order was sent to the
municipality not to give up the money, and he found
himself duped. But his master was not a man to be
trifled with; so, using the order in an extended sense,
he hired a parcel of privateers or pirate vessels, and
seizing on the next cargo of bullion proceeding from

the government should pass a law to discourage agri-
culture and promote pasture, which provided food and
clothing for the people without exhausting them by
labour.
RAMBLES IN SEARCH OF WILD-FLOWERS.
NOVEMBER.
I CAN fancy some of my readers saying: 'What can
there be to say about wild-flowers in November ?-the
blossoms are getting nipped in the hedgerows and
meadows, and few if any new ones rise up to take
their places; the trees begin to drop their leaves, and
the copses are becoming touched with the tints of
autumn: all vegetation seems to be decaying, and
winter will soon be here.' This is all very true; yet
autumn is a lovely season, and to a thinking mind one
full of fruitful thoughts and poetical associations and
fancies. They are not necessarily sad thoughts which
attend on the decaying season, although they would be
so if there were no spring-tide to which we could look
forward with hope; neither are those necessarily sad
thoughts which attend on the decay of life, though
they would be so had we not that joyful resurrection,
of which the spring is ever a type, whereon to rest
our hopes.
It is a lovely season; and though we find few flowers,
there are, nevertheless, other things which make our
country-walks delightful, and give us ample scope for
research into subjects which will well repay us for our
trouble. The many-tinted leaves of the bramble, and
the glowing, clustering berries of the rose, hawthorn,
honeysuckle, and that most exquisitely brilliant kind,
the fruit of the wild guelder-rose (Viburnum opulus),
tempt you to overload your hands with their heavy
bunches, which, mixed with wreaths of ivy and other
evergreens, make bouquets for your side-tables which
might vie with the gems of summer in brightness and
beauty-' and scent?' some will say. No, not in scent;
you must do without perfume in your autumn and
winter nosegays, and be thankful that you have bright
things to look at, and, not expecting every pleasure at
once, wait patiently and hopefully
•
Till the spring's first gale
Comes forth to tell us where the violets lic.'
But now let me invite you to walk with me to
Otterton Park; and do not be alarmed by the name,
and fancy that I am going to lead you to some stately
mansion-house, rising in dignity amidst lofty trees,
with a fine ancient park, and herds of dappled deer
congregating beneath oaks of the growth of centuries:
it is no such place; for though there are indeed fine
old oaks, and abundant magnificent groups of forest-
trees, which may once have decked the precincts of a
gentleman's grounds, Otterton Park is now only the
name bestowed on a beautiful tract of hill, copse, and
upland pasture, which rises above the pretty river
Otter near the village of Otterton, and is as lovely a
wild spot as you would wish to see. I set out early in
the day, because at so late a season of the year it is
always wise to secure your exercise, and follow your
out-door pursuit while the sun is at the highest: it
was a lovely morning, the sea sparkling in the sun-
beams; and as I pursued my former course down the
beachwalk, and over by the limekiln - cliff and the
granary, I was amused by watching the immense flocks
of larks which frequent these parts throughout the
year, but especially in the winter months; and by
gathering a few of the late blossoms of the pretty
little bugloss (Lycópsis arvensis)—a rough, bristly plant
about a foot high, with a funnel-shaped corolla of the
brightest sky-blue, with white valves; and here and
there a sea-pink, which still lingered on its turfy bed.
Everything glitters with dew, and the gossamer spider
has not been idle, for on every hedge and field lie its
wonderfully beautiful webs, which have ensnared
myriads of little spheres of dew, into which the sun
freely pours those beams which will in time dissipate
their structure and dissolve them into thin air. And
now, only marking these bright objects as I pass quickly
on, I wend my way along by the embankment without
much lingering, for my business lies farther on beyond
the river, and no new flowers tempt me to turn from
my course; so on I go, and cross the now brimming
river (for the water, usually so low, is now raised by
the tide to a level with its grassy banks) by a broken
wooden bridge, and pursue the path to the left up a
rough stony bit, somewhat intersected by mud - pools,
and through some pleasant sloping fields to the Park;
the hedges and fields being still adorned with varieties
of ragworts (senécio), exhibiting their star-shaped yellow
flowers, of the natural order Composite; and the pretty
eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis), its gaping white corolla,
streaked with purple and yellow on the palate; and
here and there bright patches of the lovely pink cen-
taury (Erythræa centaurium), which is never seen in
beauty except when the brightest beams of the sun are
full on it, and which, lovely as it is, you may try in
vain to make useful in forming an ornament to your
nosegay of wild-flowers, as a few minutes after you
gather it you find its bright-yellow anthers covered in
by its pretty pink petals, which close tightly over them,
reminding one of wayward, shy children, who refuse to
their admiring parents when most wished to do so,
shew off any of those pretty ways which have delighted
and shut themselves up in baby reserve, speechlessly
hanging down their heads the moment a stranger ap-
pears. The rise had been gradual, though constant,
from the edge of the river to the point I had now
attained, so that when I approached a belt of under-
wood overhung by fine trees, which skirted the field in
which I was on the left hand, I was surprised to find
red sandstone, of very considerable height and great
myself standing on the edge of a rather abrupt cliff of
beauty. These lofty and rocky banks are characteristic
of the Otter, and mark several parts of its course,
especially near Ottery St Mary, where the scenery is
very beautiful.
The colouring spread over this cliff in the autumnal
season is such as baffles description; the rich green of
the ivy being contrasted with the red sandstone, and
intermixed with every varied hue, from the tinted
leaves, purple, scarlet, yellow, and every shade of green,
splendid trees of holly (Ilex aquifolium) and butcher's
broom (Ruscus aculeatus), with shining leaves and bril-
liant scarlet berries, besides numerous other berries and
fruits, and high tufts of ferns, presenting a wonderful
variety of tints. Far below are the calm waters of the
river reflecting all this woodland scenery, and gliding
on as gently between their flowery banks as if they had
miles of their course to run, instead of being, as they
are in fact, within a few minutes of reaching that
last bourne,' the sea, in whose great deep they would
speedily be lost, not to emerge from it save in vapours—
which, ascending to the clouds, would be again scattered
over the face of the land in rain-drops, possibly some
of them to refresh those very herbs and trees below
which it is now pursuing its murmuring course.
There are fishermen below, and young children sport-
ing in the green meadow, and enjoying the half-wintry
air, which, though it is November, is bright and warm
with sunshine; and watching all this as the openings
here and there between the trees reveal it to me, I
pursue my path, occasionally diving down a little way
among the thickets to secure some treasure, and then
wandering over the fields to see what I can find there.
But now, before I enter on the details of what I did

find, I must say a few words about a class of plants
which, though little known or noticed, is of immense
extent and considerable interest, including under its
different families literally innumerable species, occupy-
ing every imaginable habitat, and presenting wonderful
varieties in its structure. The individuals of this
class of plants vary in size from objects barely dis-
tinguishable by the aid of powerful lenses, to huge
masses as large as a man's head-nay, much larger.
They are of every form and every hue, from sooty
black to the most delicate white, ranging through ruby,
orange, lilac, green, pink, yellow, and a thousand modi-
fications of these and other colours. In some instances
they are important edibles; in others, they fix them-
selves on the staple articles of food, and eat out their
life and substance. Some of them are highly medicinal,
and others deadly poison; and yet these wonderful
samples of the great Creator's handiwork are, with few
exceptions, passed by unknown and unnoticed by man!
In England so great is this neglect, that I question
whether one out of ten who may read this paper will
know that I allude to the fungus tribe.
Hooker thus describes this order: The lowest in the
scale of vegetables, yet very variable in appearance,
growing on the ground, or parasitic on other vegetable
substances rarely if ever aquatic, and scarcely ever
green.
In the larger sense of the word the whole
plant may be considered fructification, since distinct
from it there is no true stem. There are no branches,
no leaves.' Among other habitats in which we find
fungi are earth, moss, trunks of trees either dead or
living, fir-cones, cow-dung, dead and living leaves,
fruit, stems of mosses, and other fungi. They are also
to be found on cheese, bread, and other articles of
prepared food, as well as on wheat-the rust in wheat
and many other blights being congregated plants of
this order, so minute, indeed, as to be invisible sepa-
rately, yet so numerous as to destroy the crops. All
mildew is formed of fungi, from the pretty feathery
tufts of snow-white fur which we see on casks and
in damp cellars, to the pale-gray or brown marks
which deface the paper - hangings in a room where
damp prevails. In fact, this tribe of plants appears
in so many places and in so many forms, that it would
be impossible for me to notice a tenth part of them.
Loudon tells us that in Sweden, in the small space of
a square furlong, where the plants of all other kinds,
including mosses and lichens, did not exceed 850 species,
Fries discovered more than 2000 species of fungi. In
Russia, and other northern countries, some of the
different varieties of fungus form important articles of
diet, and many kinds which are with us considered
poisonous are there freely eaten; but in England, with
the exception of mushrooms, truffles, morels, and a
few others, the whole tribe is voted useless as an article
of food, though a few kinds are used medicinally, and
for other purposes. Galen's opinion of fungi is thus
quaintly given by Gerarde:-Galen affirms that they
are all very cold and moist, and therefore do approach
unto a cold and murthering facultie, and ingender a
clammy, pituitous, and cold nutriment if they be eaten.
To conclude, few of them be good to be eaten, and
most of them do suffocate and strangle the eater;
therefore I give my advice to those that love such
strange, newe-fangled meates, to beware of licking
honey among thornes, least the sweetness of the one
do not countervaile the sharpness and pricking of the
other.'
"The meadowe mushrooms are in kinde the best ;
It is ill trusting any of the rest ;'
so adds old Gerarde, with more sense than harmony of
metre. But now let us look about us, and see whether
we cannot collect a few of the more beautiful species
of a size that may be seen and handled.
A few days before the time of my walk to Otterton
I had rambled in another direction, intruding into a
plantation in which, strictly speaking, I had no right;
and suddenly, while looking about for flowers, happened
on a most splendid sight: under the shade of some
pines, and elevated on a grassy bank which overhung
a gravel-pit, I discovered a group of the most magni-
ficent fungi I had ever seen. Some of the younger
and smaller ones were about the size of an orange, and
others extended to a much larger size. They were of
a rich carmine hue, and shining, spotted over with large
snow-white warts, and raised on a snowy stem of about
two inches in height. The elder specimens varied in
colour from carmine to deep orange red, these being
also warted on the surface of the cap, or pileus, as it is
called. In the young ones, the delicate fringe which
connects the stem of plants of this form with the cap
was unbroken, and of snowy whiteness; but in the
elder and more matured ones it was broken, and
become yellowish and scaly. In some of these the cap
was six or seven inches across, and the stem three or four
inches in height; the veil being broken, the gills, of a
pale-yellowish hue, and some of them not reaching
nearly from the stem to the edge of the cap, were
discovered. It was altogether quite a gorgeous display
for the ground was thickly studded with them-and
one so new to me as to inflame me with a fungus
mania. I collected several of the most beautiful, and
on my return home covered a large china plate with
some of the white Lapland moss, mixed with the
pale-green bog-moss; and selecting one of my most
magnificent specimens, placed it in the centre, with a
few other kinds which I had discovered in the same
plantation round it: my main object in going to
Otterton was to endeavour to find more varieties with
which to complete my singular but exquisitely lovely
table-ornament. My much-prized discovery I found
to be the fly-blown mushroom (Agáricus muscarius), a
highly-poisonous species, used in northern countries to
destroy flies and bugs; it is the mocho-more of the Russians,
&c. who use it for intoxication. Loudon tells us that
when they drink a liquor made with this and the
epilobium, they are 'seized with convulsions in all their
limbs, followed with that kind of raving which attends
a burning fever. They personify this mushroom; and
if they are urged by its effects to suicide or any dread-
ful crime, they pretend to obey its commands. To fit
themselves for premeditated assassination they recur
to the use of the mocho-more.'
The first fungi I discovered at Otterton I did not at
once perceive to be such. They were globular, of a
pure ruby hue, and as I saw them lying in clusters on
the grassy bank I took them to be some fallen berries:
it was by mere chance that, taking one up to see of
what kind it was, I discovered that it was of the very
kind of which I was in pursuit- a beautiful fungus,
about the size of a cherry, named the crimson mush-
room (Agaricus puniceus.) Taking all I could find, I
proceeded triumphantly on my way, and soon found
several other varieties; among which were the pretty
'parrot-coloured mushroom' (A. psittácius), a brilliant
mixture of green and yellow, and also a lovely kind
whose name I did not make out, with the centre of the
cap pale-brown, shading through white into a delicate
rose-tint at the edge, and about an inch and a half
across the cap: only two specimens of this were to be
found; but there were several varieties of the purest
white, some like little cones of drifted snow; others
much flatter; and some cup-like, and so delicate and
fragile in texture that their snow-white caps were
crushed into their black linings with a touch, leaving
the fingers that had meddled with them deeply tinged
with a soot-like stain. Then there were others of
clear bright-yellow, and some of the tenderest lemon-
tint, all elegantly formed; and most beautiful they
looked for I took home every one that was not too
frail to be secured-when ranged around the central

mound of carmine and snow, and closely grouped on
the pretty mossy carpet which I had provided for
them.
From day to day I added to my collection. On one
occasion I found on a fallen branch a cluster of a
singular and beautiful kind, folded and lobed into
convolutions something like the human brain, and of
a rich orange colour: this I made out to be Tremella
mesenterica. At another time I found a bunch of yellow
things sticking up in the grass, and looking like short
blades of grass painted a bright clear yellow: indeed
it was long before I could satisfy myself that this
colouring was not some insect or other deposit; nor
was I quite clear on the point until I found some of
the same substance only a little differently cleft, and
white, and on referring to authorities found that such
were described under the name of the brittle mushroom
(Clavaria fragilis.) About this same time I perceived
some brilliant orange balls-some larger and others
smaller than a good-sized pea-floating on dead leaves
in the dikes which intersected the marshy ground near
the osmunda enclosure; and on fishing some out I saw
that they were parasitic on the leaves that bore them,
and of the fungus tribe. They were very pretty, and
lasted a long time when floated in a glass of water;
but I could not make sure of what kind they were.
My plate of treasures was, when complete, very beauti-
ful, and attracted much wonder and admiration. One
lady to whom I shewed them conceived them to be
artificial, and said: 'Yes, they are pretty. I know how
you made that'-pointing to one of shining yellow-it
is lemon-peel cut and varnished; but I do not know
how you made the others.'
6
The kind of fungus most usually known and
valued in England is the common field - mushroom
(Agaricus campestris), which is also cultivated in
gardens; the gills of this species are loose, pinky-red,
changing to liver colour, and are in contact with the
stem, but not united to it. The old writer whom I
have before quoted, Gerarde, says of this mushroom:
'the lower side is somewhat hollow set, or decked with
fine gutters drawne along from the middle centre to the
circumference.' He also speaks of some sorts which
growe upon the trunkes or bodies of old trees, very
much resembling Auricule Iudæ; that is the Jewes-eare,
doe in continuance of time grow unto the substance of
wood which the Fowlers doe call touchwood.' There
is another kind of fungus called puffe-fists, fusse-balls,
bunt, puck-fist, frog-cheese, and other odd names, which
is used for making a stupifying potion for bees. These
grow to more than the size of a man's head; indeed it is
said that they have been found measuring as much as
nearly nine feet in circumference: this is, I believe, the
Bovista nigrescens. They are white and heavy when
unripe; but when ripe, very light, of a brown colour, and
turning to powder. Cotton, in his Bee-book, tells us
the mode of using this when it is desired to stupify
bees for the purpose of removing them from one hive
to another. When you have procured one of those
pucks, put it into a large paper, pressing it down therein
to two-thirds, or near half the bulk, tying it up very
close. Put it in an oven some time after the household
bread is drawn, letting it continue all night. When it
will hold fire it is fit for your use. With a pair of
scissors cut a piece off the puck as large as a hen's egg
(better at first to have too much than too little), and fix
it to the end of a small stick, slit for that purpose, and
sharpened at the other end; which place so that it may
hang near the middle of an empty hive. This hive you
must set with the mouth upward near the stock you
intend to take, in a pail or bucket. This done set fire
to the puck with a candle, and immediately place the
stock of bees over it, tying a cloth round the hives,
which you must have in readiness, that no smoke may
come forth. In a minute's time or little more you will
with delight hear them drop like hail into the empty
hive: when the major part of them are down, and you
hear very few fall, you may beat the top of the hive
gently with your hand, to get as many out as you can;
then loosing the cloth, lift it off to a table or broad
board prepared on purpose; and knocking the hive
against it several times, many more will tumble out,
perhaps the queen among them, as I have often found
her lodging near the crown.'
In former days, when lucifer-matches were unknown,
the country - people in divers parts of England who
lived far from any neighbours used to carry these
puffe-fists kindled with fire, which lasts long in them.
I have named the truffle and morel as edible species-
the former is the Tuber cibárium; they are found under-
ground in dry and light soil, both in Europe and in
Japan and India. Dogs are taught to find this fungus
by smell, and to dig it out of the earth; and it is
on record that a man was once known to possess this
power. They are much famed in cookery, and are
either boiled simply or stewed in different modes before
being brought to table. The Morel (morchel'la esculenta)
grows on the earth, and has a round or oval cap: the
German name is Morchel. It is large and whitish, and
appears in the spring, when it is much valued, being
very delicious for sauce. It is chiefly found in places
where trees have been burned; which led,' says
Loudon, 'in Germany to a practice of cutting down
masses of forests for the sake of the future morels.
This practice became so injurious that it was neces-
sary to suppress it by law.' One of the prettiest and
at the same time best known of the fungus tribe
is that exquisite little red-cup which adorns our hedge-
banks in the early spring-time-this is the Hymeno-
mycetes coccinea, called by children fairy-cup, or some-
times fairies' bath. It appears at first as if growing
on the earth, but on closer inspection you find it
to be produced by some little dead stick which has
lain mouldering in, or half below the surface of the
earth all the winter, on which are clustered probably
two or three little cups, from three-quarters of an inch
to a barleycorn in diameter, of velvet softness, and
the richest hue of scarlet in the inside, while the
outside is of pinkish-white. With what delight have
I seen these pretty things beaming out on me from some
mossy bank in the month of March, and laid them in
my little basket by the side of the first violets of the
season, and perhaps two or three pale primroses-the
result of patient searching among the leaves--and a few
of the long tassels of the hazel-all tokens of the sweet
spring, and all therefore precious jewels to one who
loves the country, with its sweet sights and sounds. I
do not know whether Queen Mab and her suite ever
really use these pretty red things as baths; but that
mushrooms were an important article in their domestic
economy cannot be doubted if we accept the testimony
furnished us by poets of all ages and of all coun-
tries: we may cite as an instance the fairy queen's
song-Come, follow, follow me,' &c. two of the stanzas
of which are as follow:-
:-
'Upon a mushroom's head
Our tablecloth we spread;
A grain of rye or wheat
The manchet which we eat;
Pearly drops of dew we drink
In acorn-cups filled to the brink.
On tops of dewy grasse
So nimbly do we passe,
The young and tender stalke
Ne'er bends where we do walke;
Yet in the morning may be seen
Where we the night before have been.'
It is a pity that the lovers of romance and fairy lore
can no longer wonder over those deep-green rings which
mark the grass in the autumn, and amuse themselves

by fancying the elves and fairies dancing around hand
in hand beneath the moonbeams: these rings, to which
no doubt allusion is made in the last couplet of the
song, as well as in Prospero's address-
'Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,
And ye that on the sand with printless feet
Do chase the flying Neptune, and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppets, that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms'--
are by late discoveries ascertained to be the result of
the growth of some particular kinds of fungus, one of
which is very broad and white, and called the gigantic
mushroom (Agaricus giganticus.) But I must now close
these remarks, although my subject is not half ex-
hausted; urging my readers to examine for themselves,
and assuring them that even a slight degree of study
of fungi, will reveal to them wonders and beauties of
which they may have been hitherto quite unconscious.
THE STRANGE BOAT.
LAST year, when engaged in an exploration of the
Nile, it was my fortune to encounter a somewhat
queer character. We had arrived at El-Kab, the site
of the ancient Eilithyas, some short time after noon.
The heat was intense; and though all of us were
pretty well inured to the temperature of Upper Egypt,
it was judged both prudent and agreeable to defer
our exploration until the evening drew nigh. We lay
moored under a thick grove of palms alongside a tangled
field of lupines, and could distinguish no sign of antiqui-
ties but portions of a huge wall of unburnt brick between
the columnar stems of the trees. The silence peculiar
to the summer-time of the day brooded over the scene;
for when the sun has retreated beyond the equator all
the seasons are represented within the twenty-four
hours in Egypt. The northern breeze had long since
flagged, and now breathed in scarcely perceptible sighs
along the eddying stream; the leaves overhead occa-
sionally trembled, but were voiceless; the crew went
out upon the bank, and were soon sleeping here and
there among the lupines.
About an hour had passed since our arrival when
we heard in the distance, borne towards us through
the glowing air, the merry voices of a boat's crew
evidently pulling down the stream; and vigorously too,
for in a minute or so after we first heard the indistinct
and interrupted hum we could distinguish the air, and
then even some of the words. Presently a small boat
shot round a point into the centre of the reach, and the
fast-dipping oars plied so bravely, that before we
could make out the flag-no easy matter, for she came
end on-there was a momentary lull in the singing;
after which we heard a rasping sound, that invariable
sign of an in-shore movement--and the felucca, as our
reis called the fairy-like craft, came shooting to its
mooring - ground.
It belonged to an English traveller, who did not
at first shew himself, probably from fear of exposing
himself to our greetings. Vain fear, for though not
unsocial ourselves, we respected the unsociability of
others. Besides, we thought we recognised the boat;
and indeed there was no longer any possibility of doubt
when we saw a tall, grim-looking dragoman make his
appearance, and begin to operate upon some shirts. We
had passed that boat fifty times on our way up, and
on each occasion had beheld that identical dragoman
engaged in that identical operation. It was indeed the
enemy. Not the evil one; but a boat which, by its odd
appearance, strange manœuvres, and queer behaviour,
had from the beginning puzzled, interested, and almost
exasperated us. We had met it at first at Beni-Souef,
where it had just arrived, seemingly with the intention
The
of stopping. No sooner, however, did we run up along-
side, than the dragoman threw away his hot iron and
began to give vociferous instructions to the captain to
prepare for departure; and off they went before we
had driven in our pegs. We strolled about the town
for an hour or so, and set sail. Our spread of canvas
was immense, and our huge boat one of the finest
models on the Nile. No wonder, then, that some time
before sunset we overtook the stranger, which was
better calculated for rowing than for sailing.
dragoman was still erect with his iron in his hand, and
glanced at us moodily as we shot by; but no sign of
any travellers appeared. All the cabin-windows were
jealously closed, and a curtain was drawn over the
door. We began to speculate on what now seemed to
be a little mysterious; but could arrive at no definite
result, except that the boat contained most probably a
he-body and a she-body who chose to travel incog. The
fag-end of the breeze took us about a mile ahead; but
after dark, when we had moored, we saw the mysterious
stranger creep by, and rounding a point a little ahead,
disappear.
Next morning, as soon as the wind served, we of
course again gained on the enemy;' and this time,
by the aid of our telescopes, managed to make out a
European figure slowly pacing the roof of the cabin.
But as we drew nigh it made itself scarce, and only
the crew remained visible, with the exception of that
abominable dragoman with his hot iron. Thus day
after day passed; we lying along-shore regularly at
sunset, the enemy' working a couple of hours more,
and crawling a mile or so ahead, to be repassed next
morning under nearly the same circumstances. The
only addition to our information was, that there was
really a lady on board dressed in the Oriental style.
This fact we first learned from our servants, but after-
wards from our own observation; and instead of
appeasing, it only served to stimulate our curiosity.
However, we forbore to make inquiries, and endea-
voured to escape from the enemy;' but whatever
distance we gained in the day was sure to be compen-
sated by his industry at night.
C
On one occasion we had a slight communication with
the mysterious boat. Somebody on board fell ill; and
a letter in a lady's hand, but with a male signature-
a foreign name very like Alphonse de Penthiévre-was
sent to us, half in French half in English, requesting
some medicine. We supplied what we could, and
recommended the unknown patient to push on to
Minich, where there was a Frank doctor. Our advice
was taken, and 'the enemy' set sail at night; but a
stiff breeze carried us ahead next day, and we had
already visited the town when the little craft that had
caused so much speculation came up with popping sail,
and trembling under a heavy gale that began to blow
as the sun went down.
This kind of work continued until we reached Thebes,
where we stayed some time; whilst the stranger, after
a cursory glance that lasted three-quarters of an hour,
went on. We never saw any more of it during our
upward journey, nor indeed at Sponan-probably it
went on to Abu Sumbal--and had quite forgotten its
existence when it thus fell upon us at El-Kab. As may
be supposed, our curiosity-which was by no means
impertinent, for we declined allowing the servants to
pump the ironing dragoman-now revived; and when
at length M. Alphonse de Penthiévre made his appear-
ance, evidently bent on antiquarian research, I resolved
to start with the most enterprising of my companions,
in the vague hope of seeing something that would
interest or amuse me.
He was a strange-looking being, strangely accoutred,
this M. Alphonse. Tall and thin, he appeared like a
mummy just escaped from a pit; and his tight-fitting
leathern breeches, long sporting-boots that reached half-
way up his lank thighs, small braided jacket, and long-

peaked jockey-cap, converted into a turban by what
might have been a lady's petticoat-all this, I say,
gave him an original appearance quite irresistible to
behold. We preferred walking, but M. Alphonse
insisted on a donkey, and was presently ahead of us on
the queerest little animal it is possible to conceive.
Our legs would have taken us much faster, but we
paused to examine the ruins which the stranger passed
by without so much as turning his head. These were
an artificial lake, the infirm fragments of a temple, and
two square enclosures, surrounded by walls some thirty
fect thick. In the one nearest the river the peasants
of the neighbourhood were hard at work removing the
bricks to spread as manure over their fields. We could
not but regret this destruction of antique remains; but
our regrets were unavailing, and we felt confident then,
as now, that no vigorous steps towards preserving the
monuments of Egypt will be taken until they are
scarcely worth preserving. Every year the mischief
done is enormous, and seems to cause very little annoy-
ance even to professed antiquaries. These gentlemen
are generally so special in their studies, and so confined
in their sympathies, that unless some particular tablet
or some particular chamber in a temple that interests
them be interfered with, they are perfectly content to
allow hammer and pickaxe, spade and gunpowder, to
work their will on the rest. Very little exertion would
suffice to rescue what already remains from destruc-
tion; but, as we have said, this exertion will not be
made until it is too late, and until there be nothing left
in Egypt but chips and heaps of rubbish.
After strolling through these enormous enclosures
we issued into the desert behind, and proceeded
northward towards the solitary hill which formed the
necropolis of ancient Eilithyas. Our friend 'the enemy'
had not yet reached it, and we saw him at some dis-
tance from the base gesticulating most violently, and
kicking his beast in the vain hope of accelerating its
speed; whilst the Arab who had engaged himself as
donkey-boy-he was an aged youth of some seventy-
five years-was hobbling a hundred yards behind. We
walked leisurely on, and arrived in time to witness M.
Alphonse actually forcing his little donkey up the steep
slope, and occasionally helping it by putting foot to
ground on either side. Politeness induced us to resolve
to wait until the operation was terminated; but when
the animal came to a dead stop, in spite of the contor-
tions of its rider, we began the ascent, and reached the
entrance of the tombs, after having been favoured with
a grave salute in passing from the enemy,' who did not
appear to be aware that there was anything ludicrous
in his appearance or situation.
We soon ran over the principal tombs which guide-
books authorise us to pronounce interesting. They are
small in themselves, but are connected by pits and
rugged passages with very large unsculptured caves,
which probably occupy the greater part of the space
that was formerly one solid rock. The sculptures
themselves are very curious and of high antiquity, but
the state of their preservation is not at all satisfactory.
They represent scenes of domestic and agricultural life
in a very quaint and amusing manner, and throw great
light on Egyptian customs. It is from them that a
great portion of those valuable materials which have
fed the imaginations of fervid archæologists has been
derived. We, who looked calmly on, and had no
theories to support, did not see so much as our prede-
cessors; but we had a double source of interest-the
first, in the contemplation of the sculptures themselves;
the second, in that of the ingenuity which has inter-
preted them.
M. Alphonse stalked solemnly past us several times
during our examination, gazing with lack-lustre eye at
the painted walls, and evidently going through his
work as a mere matter of duty. We, not being in a
hurry, after we had visited the numbered tombs, began
exploring the rest, and finally clambered up to the
very summit of the hill, which is of an oval shape, and
entirely honeycombed on all sides and to the very
centre with excavations of all sizes. On the top we
found the traces of various tombs, and towards the
western extremity a neatly-cut staircase leading down
to a platform upon which several chambers opened.
Here we found M. Alphonse, with his legs hanging over
a precipice, engaged in lighting a cigar, and thought it
our duty to address a polite observation to him. He
seemed rather shy at first, but answered in very ver-
nacular English to the effect that Egypt was a 'wery
hinteresting country.'
6
There was now no mistaking the origin of 'the
enemy.' Bow Bells had evidently filled his infant ears
with their melody. But whence his uncouth appear-
ance, his strange dress, and his outlandish name?
Whence, above all, the Oriental lady who travelled in
habara and veil, cabined, cribbed, confined' in a
kanjia, under the protection of this unmistakable
Cockney? Our curiosity became keener than ever.
We remembered having caught a partial glimpse of the
countenance of the imprisoned lady as she returned
with her lord from a sporting excursion, and that we
thought it beautiful exceedingly '-full of poetical
melancholy suggestive of a romantic story.
It was
impossible to resist the temptation to be a little inqui-
sitive; so we began in a round-about manner, taking
care to repeat the high-sounding name of our myste-
rious friend as often as possible, and observing that
whenever it was pronounced he winced in a most
remarkable manner. However, there was no extract-
ing anything from him; and when, with a Good-
morning, gents,' he leaped down the precipice and
scrambled towards his little donkey, he left us as
much in the dark as ever about his real condition and
history.
6
We endeavoured philosophically to dismiss the sub-
ject from our minds, and pursued our investigations.
We found, however, nothing but an interminable suc-
cession of cells, chambers, tombs, caves of various
forms, but all evidently destined for sepulchral objects
except one-a kind of underground chapel with round
pillars. The place reminded me much of that Gebel
el Monta, or Mountain of the Dead, which overhangs
the city of Siwah in the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon;
the plans even of many of the tombs seemed precisely
similar.
In the valley below the hill was an isolated rock,
with two or three excavated caves of very great anti-
quity. The lintels and jambs of the doorways were
dimly ornamented with hieroglyphics; but very little
could be made out. We returned by a path leading
north of the great brick - enclosures, and noticed a
curious kind of thorn, with contorted branches covered
with prickles, said never to bear leaves, but producing
a kind of red berry, some of which still remained, and
were of an agreeable taste. On reaching the boat we
found that the enemy' had already started, and heard
the chanting of his crew in the distance. We also
pushed off about dark; but although the men worked
gallantly, it was impossible for our immense galley, so
swift under sail, to keep up with the light boat of the
enemy' when oars were brought into play. We never
saw anything more of it.
Some months passed before we ascertained the real
state of the case; and it was rather with a feeling of
disappointment that we learned that M. Alphonse de
Penthiévre was no other than Mr Jones, ironmonger of
Street, London; and that the Oriental lady, so
jealously concealed from view, and whom we took to
be some very immoral heroine, was actually Mrs Jones
herself, lately extracted from a boarding-school at
Clapham. It appears that this young lady, as soon as
the honeymoon was over, felt disgusted both with the
humdrum life of the capital and the very unpoetical

name for which she had exchanged her own musical
family appellation of Higgins. So, her lord's means
permitting, she resolved to travel under a title taken
out of some one of her favourite novels; and the idea
was carried out to the letter. She herself had a mania
for adopting the customs of the countries through
which she passed:' went out in a grisette's cap with
flying ribbons at Paris; put a tower on her head in
Normandy; donned the mantilla in Spain; and, finally,
hid her delightful little face under a veil in Egypt and
Syria. It is true that in this latter case she missed
seeing a great deal of what was curious; but her object
was not to see, but to satisfy her mania.
A very
harmless one it was, certainly, resulting in no other
inconvenience than that of awaking the intense derision
of all the people amongst whom she sojourned, and of
giving rise to speculations of a nature not very flat-
tering. It were to be desired that all travellers, in
the indulgence of their eccentricities, should be satisfied
with making themselves ridiculous.
THE POTTER OF TOURS.
AMONG the choicest works of art contributed to the
Great Industrial Exhibition by our French neighbours,
were some enamelled earthenware vases of remarkably
fine workmanship, and particularly worthy of attention
for their grotesque yet graceful decorations. These
vases had, however, a still higher claim to distinction
than that arising from their own intrinsic value, for they
were the workmanship of one who may truly be ranked
among nature's nobles,' although by birth and station
owning no greater title than that of 'Charles Avisseau,
the potter of Tours.'
*
A worthy successor of Bernard Palissy, he has,
like him, achieved the highest success in his art, in
spite of difficulties which would have caused most
other men to yield despairingly before what they
would have deemed their untoward fate. Charles
Avisseau was born at Tours on Christmas-day, in the
year 1796. His father was a stone-cutter, but when-
ever labour was slack in that department, he sought
additional occupation in a neighbouring pottery. While
still a child, he used frequently to accompany his father
to the factory. His eager attention was quickly attracted
by the delicate workmanship of the painters in enamel,
and before long he attempted to imitate their designs.
The master of the factory observed some flowers and
butterflies which he had sketched on a coarse earthen-
ware vase, and at once perceiving that he gave promise
of being a good workman, he engaged him in the service
of the factory.
which filled him with a transport of astonishment and
delight. This was the chef-d'œuvre he had so often
dreamed of, and longed to accomplish; the colours
were fired on the ware without the aid of the white
glaze, and the effect was exquisite.
'Whose work is this masterpiece?' inquired the
young man.
"That of Bernard Palissy,' was the reply; 'a humble
potter by birth. He lived at Saintes three centuries
ago, and carried with him to the grave the secret
of the means by which his beautiful enamels were
produced.'
'Well, then,' thought Avisseau, 'I will rediscover
this great secret. If he was a potter like me, why
should not I become an artist like him ?'
From that hour forward he devoted himself with the
most unwearying perseverance to his great pursuit.
He passed whole nights over the furnace; and although
ignorant of chemistry, and destitute of resources, in-
struments, or books, he tried one experiment after
another, in hopes of at length attaining the much-
desired object. His neighbours called him a madman
and a fool; his wife, too gentle to complain, often
looked on with sad and anxious eye as she saw their
scanty resources diminishing day by day-wasted, as
she conceived, in vain and fruitless experiments. All
his hopes seemed doomed to disappointment, and des-
titution stared him in the face; yet one more trial he
determined to make, although that one he promised
should be the last. With the utmost care he blended
the materials of his recomposed enamel, and applied
them to the ware, previous to placing it in the oven.
But who can describe the deep anxiety of the ensuing
hour, the hour on which the fondly-cherished hopes of
a lifetime seemed to hang? At length with beating
heart and trembling hand he opened the furnace: his
ware was duly baked, and the colours of his enamel had
undergone no change! This was a sufficient reward for
all his labours; and even to this day Avisseau can never
speak of that moment without the deepest emotion.
But his was not a mind to rest contented with what
he had already achieved: he longed still further to
perfect his art. He accordingly gave up his situation
in the factory, and opened a shop in Tours, where he
earned his livelihood by selling little earthenware
figures, ornaments for churches, &c., whilst he passed
his nights in study and in making renewed experiments.
He borrowed treatises on chemistry, botany, and mine-
ralogy; studied plants, insects, and reptiles; and suc-
ceeded at last in composing a series of colours which
were all fusible at the same temperature. One more
step remained to be achieved: he wished to introduce
gold among his enamel; but, alas! he was a poor
man, too poor to buy even the smallest piece of that
thought troubled him. Let us transport ourselves for
a few moments to the interior of his lowly dwelling,
and see how this difficulty too was overcome. It is a
winter's evening; two men-Charles Avisseau and his
son-are seated at a table in the centre of the room;
they have worked hard all day, but are not the less
intent upon their present occupation-that of moulding
a vase of graceful and classic form. Under their direc-
tion, two young sisters are engaged in tracing the veins
upon some vine-leaves which had recently been mo-
delled by the artists; while the mother of the family,
seated by the chimney-corner, is employed in grinding
the colours for her husband's enamels. Her counte-

seau family gathered in the long winter evenings, Charles
would spend hour after hour in tracing out new designs
for the earthenware he was to paint on the morrow.
He was at first too poor to purchase either pencil or
paper, and used to manufacture from clay the best
substitute he could for the former, while he generally
employed the walls of the apartment as a substitute
for the latter. He applied himself indefatigably to the
study of every branch of his art-the different varieties
of earths, the methods of baking them, the mode of
producing various enamels, &c.-until, after some years
of patient labour in the humble situation he had first
occupied, he was offered the post of superintendent of

and then she might be perceived to direct an anxious
and inquiring glance towards her goodman, who seemed
to be this evening even more than usually pensive. At
last he exclaimed, more as if speaking to himself than
addressing his observation to others:
'Oh, what would I not give to be able to procure the
smallest piece of gold!'

cages, in which are contained a numerous family of
frogs, snakes, lizards, caterpillars, &c., which are in-
tended to serve as models; rough sketches, broken
busts, half-finished vases, lie scattered around. The
furnaces are constructed in a little shed in the garden,
and one of them has been half-demolished, in order to
render it capable of admitting the gigantic vase which
Avisseau has sent to the Great Exhibition. There we
trust the successor of Bernard Palissy will meet with
the success so justly due to his unassuming merit, and
to the persevering genius which carried him onwards to
his goal in the midst of so much to discourage, and
with so little help to speed him on his way.
'You want gold!' quietly inquired his wife: 'here is at all hours of the day labouring with unremitting

long-treasured pledge in Avisseau's hand. He gazed
upon it with deep emotion: how many were the asso-
ciations connected with that little circlet of gold-the
pledge of his union with one who had cheered him in
his sorrows, assisted him in his labours, and aided him
in his struggles! And, besides, would it not be cruel
to accept from her so great a sacrifice? On the other
hand, however, the temptation was strong; he had so
longed to perform this experiment! If it succeeded,
it would add so much to the beauty of his enamel: he
knew not what to do. At length, hastily rising from
his seat, he left the house. He still retained the ring
in his hand a great struggle was going on in his mind;
but each moment the temptation to make the long-
desired experiment gained strength in his mind, until
at last the desire proved irresistible. He hurried to
the furnace, dropped the precious metal into the cru-
cible, applied it to the ware, which he then placed in
the oven, and, after a night of anxious watching, held
in his hand a cup, such as he had so long desired to
see, ornamented with gilt enamel! His wife smiled as
she gazed upon it, although at the same time a tear
glistened in her eye; and looking proudly upon her
husband, she exclaimed: 'My wedding-ring has not
been thrown away!'
Still, Avisseau, notwithstanding his genius, was des-
tined to lead for many years a life of poverty and ob-
scurity. It was not until the year 1845 that M. Charles
Sciller, a barrister at Tours, first drew attention to the
great merit of some of the pieces he had executed, and
persuaded him to exhibit them at Angers, Poitiers, and
Paris. The attention of the public once directed towards
his works, orders began to flow in upon him apace.
The President of the Republic and the Princess Matilda
Bonaparte are among his patrons, and the most
tinguished artists and public men of the day are fre-
quently to be met with in his atelier. In the midst of
all this unlooked-for success, Avisseau has ever main-
tained the modest dignity of his character.

'A LOST ART.'
In No. 407 of this Journal there is an article en-
titled A Lost Art,' in which is mentioned the juggling
trick of swallowing water, and then vomiting it again
under the semblance of wine, &c. On reading it I
remembered having read an explanation of this feat
somewhere, and on examination found an account of
it in an intelligent little book for its time, 'Experi-
mental Philosophy, by Henry Power, Doctor of Physick.
London, 1664. His account, after describing the changes
produced in vegetable infusions by acids, &c. is as
follows:-'By which ingenious commixtion of spirits
and liquors did Floram Marchand, that famous water-
drinker, exhibit those rare tricks and curiositys at
London of vomiting all kind of liquors at his mouth.
For, first, before he mounts the stage, he always drinks
in his private chamber, fasting, a gill of the decoction of
Brasil; then, making his appearance, he presents you
with a pailful of lukewarm water, and twelve or thirteen
glasses, some washed in vinegar, others with oyl of
tartar and oyl of vitriol; then he drinks four-and-twenty
dis-glasses of the water, and carefully taking up the glasse
which was washed with oyl of tartar, he vomits a reddish
liquor into it, which presently is brightned up and
tinged into perfect and lovely claret. After this first
assay, he drinks six or seven glasses more (the better
to provoke his vomiting), as also the more to dilute and
empale the Brasil decoction within him; and then he
takes a glass rinsed in vinegar, and vomits it full, which
instantly, by its acidity, is transcoloured into English
beer, and vomiting also at the same time into another
glass-which he washes in fair water-he presents the
spectators with a glass of paler claret or Burgundian
wine; then drinking again as before, he picks out
the glass washed with oyl of vitriol, and, vomiting
a faint Brasil-water into it, it presently appears to be
sack-and perchance if he washed the one half of the
glass with spirit of sack, it would have a faint odour
and flavour of that wine also. He then begins his
carouse again, and drinking fifteen or sixteen glasses,
till he has almost extinguished the strength and tincture
of his Brasil-water; he then vomits into a vinegar-glass
again, and that presents white wine. At the next dis-
gorgement-when his stomach is full of nothing but clear
water, indeed, which he has filled so by the exceeding
quantity of water which at every interval he drinks-he
then deludes the spectators by vomiting rose-water,
angelica - water, and cinnamon - water, into those glasses
which have been formerly washed with those spirits. And
thus was that famous cheat performed, and indeed acted
with such a port and flowing grace by that Italian
bravado, that he did not onely strike an admiration into
vulgar heads and common spectators, but even into the
judicious and more knowing part of men, who could not
readily find out the ingenuity of his knavery.' From
this it would appear that the method used was the same
with that of the Wizards of the present day; with this
difference-that, in accordance with the tastes of a ruder
age, they formerly used their stomachs as receptacles for
the liquor, whereas in the present more fastidious age
M. Brongniart, the influential director of the great
porcelain manufactory at Sévres, begged of him to
remove thither, promising him a liberal salary if he
would work for the Sévres Company, and impart to them
his secrets. I thank you for your kindness, sir,' replied
the potter of Tours, and I feel you are doing me a
great honour; but I would rather eat my dry crust
here as an artisan than live as an artist on the fat of
the land at Sévres. Here I am free, and my own
master: there I should be the property of another, and
that would never suit me.'
When he was preparing his magnificent vase for the
Exhibition, he was advised to emboss it with the royal
arms of England. 'No,' he replied, 'I will not do that.
If Her Majesty were then to purchase my work, people
might imagine I had ornamented it with these insignia
in order to obtain her favour, and I have never yet
solicited the favour of any human being!' Avisseau
has no ambition to become a rich man. He shrinks
from the busy turmoil of life-loving his art for its
own sake, and delighting in a life of meditative retire-
ment, which enables him to mature his ideas, and to
execute them with due deliberation.
In the swamps and in the meadows he studies the
varied forms and habits of reptiles, insects, and fish,
until he succeeds in reproducing them so truly to the
life that one can almost fancy he sees them winding
themselves around the rushes, or gliding beneath the
shelter of the spreading water - leaves. His humble
dwelling, situated in one of the faubourgs of Tours, is
well worthy of a visit. Here he and his son-now
twenty years of age, who promises to prove in every
respect a worthy successor to his father-may be found

EPITHALAMIA.
FOR A SISTER'S WEDDING.
I.
BY W. E. L.
O DAY half happiness, half mystery!
O hour of gladness, long'd and waited for,
When hope and love-born fancy are no more,
But dreamland changes to reality!
How shall I welcome thee?-the silent hours
Are rolling upward on the orb of Time
Into the daylight, and the morning rime
Rises already on the orange-flowers.
Sweet sister bride! from true affection sprung,
My thoughts this day to thee I dedicate;
Would that, so large a theme to celebrate,
Some voice, melodious more than mine, had sung!
Yet take the rhymes, of imperfections full:
Like the lone blossoms of the Alpine snow,
They speak of summer warmth hid deep below,
And, to a cold world, preach the Beautiful.
II.
There is no thought can sweep across the mind
With more of melting tenderness and grace,
Than old remembrances of some lov'd place
With memories of lov'd persons intertwined.
Thus, sister mine, how many a summer hence
The vision of that shelter'd southern vale
(Let but the hint suffice to tell the tale),
Shall beam on thee with bright pre-eminence!
Through the dim lapse of years, as through a dream,
Shall bloom far off a lowly garden-home,
And fancy paint a happy pair that clomb
Up the hillside, or wander'd by the stream;
Or, 'mid deep copses hidden, watched afar
The fading landscape till the shadows fell,
And down the steep, and through the quiet dell,
Homeward they went, beneath the evening-star.
III.
'O coming Time! O messenger of light
Sent from God's fathomless futurity
To gleam upon the infinite To Be,
And clear the tangl'd mesh of wrong and right,
Tarry not longer! from thy hiding-place
Let the fresh Present and its pure day-spring,
Lure the clogg'd pinion of thy sluggish wing;
O let us see and know thee face to face!'
Frail thought of vanity! to weakly Sense
How should eternal wisdom deign reply?
Only the echo of my spirit's sigh
Mocks at me with my own mad eloquence.
And it is well: we know not what we pray.
Nathless how trancing were the golden light
Of coming action to this panting sight,
Dimm'd in this dusky prison-house of clay!
For thee, O sister lov'd and cherish'd well!
Would I might trace for thee the unknown tale
Whose end is hidden 'neath Time's solemn veil,
Whose prelude is the chiming marriage-bell.
Ah, that I cannot! ah, that I am dust!
But He who lives while ages roll away,
Perfect and Present, the I AM for aye-
He never fails to love. In Him I trust.
So may the incense of a brother's heart
That rises to the ear which heareth prayer,
Not pass unfruitful into careless air,
Fragrant and precious only to depart;
Rather, returning from the throne above
Fraught with choice blessing, let each prayer be
given,
And faith be born, and trustfulness in Heaven,
Strong as man's friendship, warm as woman's love.
IV.
Yet do I err, denying that we know
What shall befall us: darkness is no more
Beyond the threshold of this mortal shore,
And doubt but shadows things that are below.
Night is around us; and we cannot see
Things that are earthly for the earthly night,
But clear the vision of the worlds of light
Shining far off from earth's obscurity.
Yea, though to-morrow's fleeting joy or pain
Be shrouded from us in a rayless gloom,
Bright glearns, ayont the portals of the tomb,
The chart of that fair land we seek to gain.
If all unwittingly I do thee wrong-
If, rhyming freely, I have thrill'd some chords
Of too deep feeling with my careless words,
Pardon the folly of a true-meant song.
Think that all error springs from warm good-will;
Treasure the good, despite its harsh, quaint dress;
Steep all the ill in deep forgetfulness;
Forgive the song, and love the singer still.
GOLD DISCOVERIES.
As indicative of the change caused by the gold
discoveries on the aspect of affairs in the colony, we may
only present the following passages from the Sydney
Herald' of May 28:- Compared with 1843, when the
colony was at the lowest depth of its prostration, the
early months of 1851 were as the light of noon compared
with the blackness of midnight, or as the serenity of an
Australian spring with the horrors of an arctic winter.
But if we attempt to compare the first four months of the
present year, when Australian gold was a thing unthought
of, with the last two weeks of the current month of May,
when Australian gold is the only thing thought of, we
shall be at a loss for any metaphor that can adequately
illustrate the stupendous change. If we were to say that
the colony has been panic-stricken-that the whole
population has gone mad, we should use a bold figure of
speech, but not much too bold to indicate the fact. It is
as if the Genius of Australia had suddenly rushed from
the skies, and proclaimed through a trumpet, whose strains
reverberate from mountain to mountain- from valley
to valley-from town to town-from house to house-
piercing every ear and thrilling every breast: "The
destinies of the land are changed!"'

There are many pleasing associations that the 'lang
yellow broom' awaken in the mind; but to the lover of
Flora, perhaps one of the dearest is the remembrance
that the gorgeous luxuriance of its golden blossoms so
enraptured the illustrious Linnæus, when he first beheld
it in profusion, on his visit to England, that he fell down
upon his knees in an ecstasy of pleasure, to enjoy such a
glorious sight. And as the mind of that eminent natu-
ralist was endued with a deep sense of the goodness of his
Creator, we cannot doubt but that he then breathed a
prayer of gratitude to the benevolent Being who had
furnished him with the gratifying spectacle.-Gardiner's

THE MEDIOCRACY.
A MAN of genius was once sitting in a theatre looking
with wonder at the happy faces around him, and
listening in perplexity to the shouts of laughter that
echoed on all sides. The piece was a poor mediocrity,
the language tame, the epigram pointless; and at
length his surprise merging in disgust, and that in
testiness and ill-humour, with a sweeping glance of
angry superiority he left the house. Our man of
genius was not sorry for himself: he did not regret
that he could not be diverted like other people, but
was indignant with them for finding amusement in
what was weariness to him.
He would now pass the evening with a book. It
should be a book of recreation, for his mind wanted
unbending: a clever novel would be better than a dull
play. But how to choose? He was but little acquainted
with that department of literature, and he determined
to take extensive popularity as the test of merit.
Casting his eye, therefore, along the shelves of the
circulating library, he fixed upon a spot where the
volumes were frailer and dingier in appearance than
elsewhere, and selected the frailest and dingiest of
them all. At home with his prize, he sat down to
be happy. But he was not happy. The book was
commonplace. It had no interest, no story, no fancy,
no character. He confounded the persona one with
another. They seemed to be always drinking tea, and
arguing about something or other-he did not know
what. They soon began to mingle and flit before his
heavy eyes; their voices sank into a drowsy mono-
tone; his head drooped lower and lower; and at length
as his brow rapped the table, he started up in renewed
indignation. But this time his anger was sicklied
o'er with the pale cast of thought.' He looked curiously
at the torn and stained leaves, the folded corners-
tokens of the patient interest which would take the
next opportunity of returning to a labour of love-the
half-obliterated traces of some critical pencil, expressive
of dissent or admiration. He calculated in imagination
the number of perusals it had taken to change perma-
nently the very colour of the paper. Then a vision rose
before him of the theatre he had left, with its merry
faces and applauding voices; and his disdain began to
give way before an oppressive sense of magnitude and
multitude.
But he must spend his evening somehow, for he had
resolved against work; and taking his crush-hat out of
its box, and elongating it to the orthodox figure, he set
forth for one of the drawing-rooms to which he had the
entrée. Here the lights, the colours, the motion, the
fair faces, the graceful forms, reassured him; and he

drew near to group after group, that the buzz of voices
might resolve for his gratification into articulate dia-
logue. But what dialogue! Without thought, without
spirit, without substance-more pointless than the play,
tamer than the novel, and minus the grace of manner
which pleaded for the one, and the elegance of language
which concealed the poverty of the other, it seemed the
very quintessence of commonplace. In one or two
corners a question of literary or social interest was
discussed; but these corners were avoided by the
throng, who listened with the most animated attention
to platitudes which, if turned into print, could hardly
have amused even the most devoted novel - reader.
The philosophical observer, however, was no longer
indignant; his disdain was lost in a kind of awe, as
the audience at the play, the countless readers of the
book, and the brilliant assembly before him, all met and
mingled in a single body, which seemed to overwhelm
and crush him with its vastness. 'I was wrong,' said
he, communing with himself, as he elongated his hat
again to go out into the street: 'my contempt arose
from ignorance-my indignation from weakness; the
Mediocracy is a great power, which can neither be
wounded by the one nor intimidated by the other.'
He was right. 'Mediocre' and 'commonplace,' used
as terms of contempt, are meaningless when applied
to the great body of the age. Beneath this body
the lower intelligences indicate imperfect beings ap-
proaching gradually the standard: above it, the higher
intelligences are merely a few offshoots thrown out
into the future-the pioneers and forlorn - hopes of
the present. It is on the main body genius depends
for nourishment and reward. When genius says it
speaks to the future, it means the future of the present
commonplace generation; for this generation is the
parent of everything that will be excellent and glorious
in the coming time. Let not genius suppose itself to
be anything independent or self-existing; for it derives
its origin, force, and authority from the commonplace
mass it affects to despise. Napoleon was literally, what
he has been called in another sense, the man of the
age;' for if the thought which governed his career had
not existed, though without form and void, in the
French mind, he would have been but a stunted corporal
after all. Scott could not of himself have brought about
a revolution in romance; for unless the public taste
had been in a state of preparation, he would have
written in vain. Genius, in short, must be en rapport
with the time it addresses, or its electric force will have
no effect.
This explains the reason why commonplace litera-
ture pleases commonplace readers, and why common-
place people are in their element in commonplace

company. If you desive an ignorant man to choose
between a book of science and a novel, his choice will
fall upon the novel, because that belongs to a species of
literature he comprehends. He can feel an interest in
persons and personal adventures, which does not seem
to him to attach to reasonings and experiments; and,
in like manner, if the novel develops some high prin-
ciple, or is enriched with profound thought, he will
willingly exchange it for another better adapted to the
calibre of a commonplace mind. So, in company, like
affects like. A commonplace man will always have the
majority in his favour. We do not listen to a celebrity
because we are interested in what he says. If that were
written in a book, we of the mediocracy would not cut
the leaves; but hearing it from the man himself viva
voce, we take it as a part of the show. When the star
of the evening has disappeared, then our true pleasure
begins, and that consists in exchanging commonplace
sentiments with our commonplace friends on what we
have seen and heard. The universal buzz that runs
through the room is not the buzz of applause, but of
busy self-satisfaction. We are exercising an instinct
of our commonplace being, and deriving from the exer-
cise the enjoyment which beneficent nature annexes to
the fulfilment of her commands.
nor the Shoe-king! A great part of the literature of
China consists of novels and poetry. In the one, they
represent their own manners to the life, and are never
weary of contemplating the commonplace image; in
the other, they illustrate their own mind in all its happy
destitution of thoughts and ideas. The schoolmaster
publishes his verses by pasting them on the door-post;
the cook glorifies his kitchen-walls in the same manner;
all China writes verses; and a conventional edict con-
stitutes all verses poetry.
Among the western nations, the mediocracy of England
may be reckoned the strongest. Genius is more afraid
of it than elsewhere; and eccentricity does not shew
itself in public lest it should be mobbed. It was not
her middle-classes, but her mediocracy, that saved
England in the late revolutionary year. The medio-
cracy could not make out the genius of Red Repub-
licanism; and it is to the present moment a standing
puzzle with this commonplace body, how ignorance
and crime are to be enlightened and reformed by having
the government of the country and the fortunes of the
age intrusted to their discretion. Loyalty, liberty,
religion- these are the three great thoughts of the
English mediocracy, who are as abundantly satisfied
as the Chinese can be with their own She-king.

In some nations mediocrity, as a power, is stronger
than in others; but China may be pointed to as its
grand stronghold. This flowery land is the centre of
the world of commonplace. It has no ignorant classes
in one sense of the word: all are educated up to a
certain point of mediocrity, and genius is kept down
by main force. To surpass the standard works of the
language-standard two or three thousand years ago
-is an offence at law; and even if it were not so, the
Celestial mediocracy would turn away with contempt

THE BOURGEOIS WEDDING.
A TALE.
A WEDDING in the middle and humbler classes of
society in France is a very different thing from a
wedding in England. The double ceremony before the

or in the afternoon, This over, in most cases the
whole wedding-party adjourn to some celebrated house
outside the barrier, where they sit down to dinner
about six, to rise about eleven. Then dancing begins,
continuing in most cases until six o'clock in the morn-
ing. The visitors then go away to take a little rest,
meeting again at dinner-time, and dancing once more all
night. Sometimes there is a third night; but in general
reasonable people are contented with two; while those
who aim at something a little above the ordinary run
of middle-class society, actually stop at one.

Hector Rubinet was an ironmonger in a large way
of business in the Rue St Denis, an elector, and, he was
proud to say, very nearly eligible to the deputation.
Young, rich, and tolerably good-looking, he was the
admiration of all the papas and mammas, with mar-
riageable daughters, in the quarter. But, like most of
his class, Hector was for some time not at all inclined
to yield up his liberty too readily. Not that a French
husband enjoys much less liberty when married than
before; but the class which has grown rich and power-
ful since 1789-the citizen or bourgeois class-appears
far more under the influence of their wives than the
humbler or more elevated classes. I think this may
be easily explained. The middle-classes are in general,
though great grumblers, rich, contented, and happy.
They naturally, then, like ease and tranquillity, and
married men in general seem to agree that submission
to the gentle influence of the female head of the family
is the surest mode of obtaining this desirable state of
affairs. I have often remarked myself, in this great
city, called in France the capital of Europe, that if you
want a specimen of the genus familiarly known as
'a brute of a husband,' you must look for him among
the speculative, reckless traders, who, with little credit
and less capital, try to fight the battle of life. He it is
that rules his home with an iron rod, and has a meek,
trembling, submissive wife, who never differs from him
in opinion until the day when a reasonable chance of
separation offers. To my ideas, this speaks volumes
in favour of that phase of matrimony where at all
events the wife enters heartily into the counsels of the
family, and has at least her proportionate share of
influence in its government.
Hector Rubinet was, however, of a different opinion.
His idea of matrimony was severe. He wanted a wife
who would yield to him in all things, have no will of
her own, and never even venture to differ from him
in opinion. From twenty to thirty he vainly sought
the object of his wishes. He found plenty of young
ladies who were as gentle as lambs-who looked models
of excellence-whose very tone seemed to promise all
he could desire; but Hector was a physiognomist,
and ever found some alarming symptoms in the fair
and youthful aspirants to matrimonial honours around
him. One had an eye which spoke volumes of energy;
another had a mouth with an authoritative curl; another
had a determined chin; while a fourth had an inde-
pendent wave about her hair which looked serious. In
their way of sitting, walking, dancing, Hector could
find some sign of incipient rebellion against the sove-
reignty of man; and at last it was agreed in the
bourhood that he would settle down into an old bache-
lor, and leave all his disposable cash in some eccentric
English way.
The wedding was fixed the very next day. Dire was
the consternation in several families, who had made
up their minds to Hector not marrying, and looked
upon him as a future generous old bachelor, who would
make presents to the children, be useful and liberal
at weddings, be constant in his distribution of gifts
on New Year's Day-in fact, who would spend his
money in a way satisfactory to the feelings of his
friends in general. But now this hope was gone.
Hector was going to marry, would have children of
his own, a wife to dress, &c.; and their visions vanished.
Still all who were invited went to the wedding. It
was a splendid affair. Hector had spared no expense
with the trousseau of his future wife: he had been
liberal, even generous; and she looked so quietly
beautiful and happy in her white satin dress, wreath of
roses, and rich blonde veil, that all gave an involun-
tary meed of praise to his good taste. She had near
her a beauty of another kind. This one was about
seventeen-a very child in form and expression, and yet
exquisitely lovely. Her hair waved, however, in alarm-
ing ringlets over her shoulders; her eye, though mild,
was full of latent fire; and her beautiful mouth
laughingly exposed white and pearly teeth, which
made Hector shudder with terror at the bare idea of his
having selected such a wife. She came with Hector's
cousin, Mme St Clair, a schoolmistress, who had brought
her up from childhood, and who treated her as a visitor
rather than a boarder, the young lady being an orphan
under the guardianship of an only brother.
The marriage took place at the parish church, and
then the whole party adjourned to a celebrated restau-
rant outside the Barrière de l'Etoile, in the Avenue de
Neuilly. Dinner had been ordered for six o'clock,
and in the meantime the party wandered in the fields
behind the house, each lady taking the arm of a gentle-
man. Hector proposed a walk as far as the Bois de
Boulogne.
'No,' said his wife very quietly; it is too far, and
will fatigue us before we begin to dance. I am going
to sit down upon the grass.'
Hector gave a look of wild astonishment at his
meek and submissive partner, but she appeared not
to notice it, sitting down on the grass amid a regular
titter from the whole company. Hector Rubinet said
nothing: he recollected that it was his wedding-day,
and that at all events he could not venture upon shew-
ing authority on such an occasion. Nothing further
occurred to mar the happiness of the hour, and six
o'clock soon came round, with its splendid dinner, its
abundant wine, its laughter and merriment. As usual,
the banquet was kept up until a late hour, and it was
eleven o'clock when the tables were cleared away for
the first quadrille.
It con-
About an hour later, while the music was sounding
merrily, and Hector Rubinet was resting after a polka,
neigh-breathing the fresh air with his wife at the open
window, an elegant cab drew up at the door.
The young man did not get out: he appeared simply
tained a young man, and a little groom stood behind.
listening to the music. Hector Rubinet at once recog-
nised him, as one of the habitual visitors at Neuilly
Palace-Charles de Monsigny-a favourite companion
of the Duke of Orleans. He was a dissipated young
man, who had already almost grown weary of life, or
rather who had ceased to find the least zest or excite-

One day, however, at a small party given by a sedate
married couple of the Rue Rambuteau, the eye of
Hector fell upon a damsel, quite a stranger to him,
who drew his attention at once. She was about five-
and-twenty, fair, with a white, clear complexion, and
a tendency to embonpoint, which of itself was pro-
mising. Athalie Poussinque had, moreover, a soft,
sleepy eye, a full mouth, a slow, methodical step, a
plain way of wearing her hair. He made inquiries.
She had no fortune; she was a poor relation, placed
under the protection of Mme Dubois, at whose house
he met her, and appeared, in fact, the most likely
person in the world to be a submissive and obedient
wife.
some of his own set.
Hector Rubinet darted across the room, down the
stairs, and into the street. Charles de Monsigny was
the son of the landlord on whose estate Hector had been
born; they had been playmates together, and Charles
had never forgotten their early friendship.
'M. le Count,' he said, almost out of breath, I

had the honour to recognise you. I did not venture
to send you a formal invitation; but as you are here, I
hope you will favour’-
6
And so, my poor Hector,' replied the young man,
leaping out of his cabriolet, we are getting married!
What can have driven us to so desperate a resolve?'
'Ah, monsieur, you are always satirical! But I have
found a model of a wife. I shall have the honour to
introduce you to her. She is,' added he in a whisper,
'everything I could wish-knows no will but mine, and
will scarcely speak unless I give her tacit leave.'
You are very happy, my dear Hector,' continued
Charles in a tone of half-affection, half-sarcasm; that
is to say, if one can ever call a married man happy.'
'Ah, M. le Count, your turn will come!'
'Mine? Never! I could not take the trouble.
congratulate you on your courage, but must beg to
decline following in your footsteps.'
I
At this moment they entered the ball-room, and
Hector, in a loud voice, introduced Count Charles de
Monsigny to his wife, who received him most graciously.
'I am very proud of the honour you do us,' she said
bowing, and I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you
at our country-house.'
6
Our country-house!' stammered Hector, avoiding
the eyes of his aristocratic friend.
'My dear,' replied Athalie in a firm and resolute
tone, I assure you we must have a country-house.
I have been brought up in the country, and could not
habitually sleep in the dense air of the Rue St Denis.'
'I highly approve madame's taste,' said Charles
gravely, and shall be most happy to visit you in your
rural retreat. I like to see conjugal happiness, though
not a marrying-man myself.'
6
Hector made no reply; he was completely overcome.
He secretly yielded to despair. There was in his heart
no power of resisting the quiet, positive way of his
young wife. The dancing at this moment ceased, and
Athalie, taking the count's arm, moved to walk round
the room. As she did so she caught a meaning look
exchanged between the friends.
'M. Hector is a happy man,' said the count politely,
as they advanced round the salon.
•
Do you think so?' replied Athalie slily.
Certainly. He evidently thought he had married a
fool, and he finds that he has married his master,' said
Charles, who had all the cool impudence of his class-
that of Frenchmen of the world.
Athalie made no reply, quite convinced that it was
lucky for her she had not taken the count for her
husband he would not have been so easily deceived
in her character; or, if he had, would not have yielded.
The music again struck up, and Mme Rubinet being
engaged, introduced her young friend to De Monsigny
as a partner. The count readily acquiesced, determined
to join in the spirit of the affair. He was certainly a
little amused at the coolness with which Athalie gave
him a mere child to dance with; but he accepted her
with a good grace. He was puzzled, however, what to
say to so young a girl of the bourgeois class. It was
his first attempt, and it made him feel far more hesita-
tion than he would at meeting with one of his own
rank under similar circumstances.
'Are you fond of dancing?' said the count in a
patronising tone.
'Yes, monsieur, very fond: all girls at my age are;
but I never dance with pleasure at a wedding. I know
not why-it seems too serious an affair to be treated so
lightly.'
I admire your taste,' replied the count; who was,
however, absolutely petrified at such an observation
from a young girl.
You seem surprised, however,' she continued. 'But
I am not in the habit of consulting my own wishes.
Mine St Clair wished me to come, and I came.'
Charles now unhesitatingly opened a serious conver-
sation with his young companion. He spoke of music,
the fine arts, poetry, even of politics, and found that on
all these topics he had met his master. The young
girl had evidently been wholly devoted to study from
her infancy, and had profited largely by her reading
and thinking. The young man was equally surprised
and pleased; so much so, that for the rest of the evening
he devoted himself exclusively to her, and towards
morning became so fascinated that in low, whispered
tones he made a solemn declaration of love, and said,
that could he be found worthy of such a wife, he
would be happy to set aside all his prejudices, and
marry. The young girl made him some jocular reply,
and then rose, just as the party broke up, to join Mme
St Clair.
Next day Charles had not forgotten the passion of
the previous evening; but he no longer felt under the
influence of the feelings which had made him speak so
plainly. He certainly recollected all her many per-
fections of person and character, and thought that had
she been one of his own class he would certainly have
been tempted to follow up the acquaintance so auspi-
ciously commenced. But she was a little bourgeoise,
and he did not even know her name. He therefore
resolved to think no more of her, but to make up his
mind to the fact, that he had spent a very pleasant
evening, quite sure that he would be as easily for-
gotten as he himself would forget. He pursued his
usual pleasures-went to the Opera, played billiards,
lounged away his existence, and tried to persuade
himself that he was far happier than if he had created
a happy home, and sought a good and affectionate
wife.
About a month later he was driving up the Champs
Elysées with a pair of horses and a phaton, when his
eye caught sight of the young girl walking amid the
fashionable crowd on the boulevard arm-in-arm with
Mme St Clair. She was very pale and thoughtful, he
perceived, and his heart smote him. It might be
through his inconsiderate conduct the other evening.
He pulled in his horses, threw the reins to a servant,
and hurried towards them. His quick glance caught
that of the young girl, who coloured violently, and
seemed about to pass.
Ah, mademoiselle!' he cried, in a tone of genuine
delight, I am so happy to have had this chance of
meeting with you. I did not catch your name the
other evening, or I should have called and thanked you
for the pleasure I enjoyed in your society.'
The young girl smiled, and looked at Mme St Clair.
"We shall be happy to see you,' said she, handing
her card to the count, any Thursday evening when
you are disengaged.'
'I shall avail myself with delight of your kind offer,'
replied the count. 'And now, will you allow me to
offer you both a seat in my carriage? I was about to
drive to St Cloud before dinner.'
Mme St Clair bowed acquiescence, and next minute
Charles de Monsigny had the young girl by his side,
her eyes sparkling- her whole face beaming with
satisfaction. Away they drove, hundreds of fair ladies
and numerous horsemen bowing to the count as he
went, and casting curious eyes on his companions,
especially on Mme St Clair, who, unfortunately, was a
little over-dressed--an unpardonable sin in the eyes of
French refinement. Once or twice he coloured vio-
lently as impertinent eye-glasses from well-known
fashionables were levelled at her; but the fascinating
conversation, sensible remarks, and singular power of
observation manifested by his younger companion, soon
made him forget everything else but the pleasure of
being in her society.
About six o'clock he left them at their door-they lived
in the Rue du Faubourg St Honoré-with a promise to
visit them on the following Thursday. But next Thurs-
day came, and he went not, though his heart told him

that he was eagerly expected; that the young girl would
be arrayed in her best to greet him, and would suffer
disappointment at his failure. But some of his friends
had satirised the appearance of his new acquaintance,
and he was not proof against the power of sarcasm.
He indeed felt that on the occasion of his second inter-
view he had been far more seriously influenced by her
charms than before, but still he could not reconcile his
mind to the fact of marrying into a class which was
not his own. Yet he both felt that his affections
were engaged, and that he had behaved badly to the
poor girl. His attention had been so marked, and
had been received with such evident pleasure, that
this was quite plain. He plunged once more into
the turmoil of the world -played, danced, joined cham-
pagne suppers, and did everything which could banish
thought and deaden feeling. All was in vain; but
though he could not resist, he had no intention of
surrendering. He thought of travel, and one morning
rose early with a view to making the necessary pre-
parations. He sat at breakfast in deep thought: at
length he took up his pen, and hastily dashed off a
letter, which he sent to be put in the post by one of his
servants.
This done, he seemed easier in his mind. But still
there was an air of restless impatience about him, as if
he expected some one or something. At last he took
a book, called for a Turkish hookah, and sat down to
try and calm himself with reading and smoking. Again
it proved a vain attempt; when, just as his patience
was at an end, a servant entered and announced a
visitor-Captain Edgar Senincourt-Warville, a young
noble who had sought distinction in Africa in the
service of the new dynasty.
'Ah, Edgar, my good friend,' said he rising; 'you come
in the very nick of time. I was as dull as a mummy.
But what is the matter? You look more like an angry
lion than a good-natured friend who has called in to
pass a friendly hour.'
'Monsieur, I come here on grave and solemn busi-
ness. I come to ask an account of the life and honour
of my only sister Adela de Senincourt-Warville.'
'My dear fellow, what mean you? Your sister!-I
never saw her.'
'When you met my sister at the wedding of M.
Hector Rubinet, where she had very improperly been
taken by Mme St Clair, you amused yourself all the
evening by paying attention to her, and before morn-
ing you made a declaration which the poor child took
in earnest.'
'Ha! and she was your sister?' cried Charles, looking
the picture of blank surprise.
there remains but for me to put it out of your power
for ever to boast of your facile conquest.'
'I boast!' cried Charles indignantly.
'You allowed others to talk to you in a way to justify
the supposition.'
'I will allow, Edgar, that I have been very wrong,'
began the count calmly; but if you will listen to
me'-
'No, I will not listen! I might be influenced by
your forked tongue. I daresay, now you find that she
is Adela de Senincourt-Warville, you are quite willing
to apologise and offer your hand'
Nay, listen to me I beg,' cried Charles, whose
anger was rising. You are mistaken-grossly mis-
taken.'
'Must I call you coward?' said Edgar, stamping his
feet on the floor of the room.
"This passes the bounds,' exclaimed the count in
reply. 'To-morrow morning at break of day our
seconds will arrange the details. Good-afternoon.'
"Good-afternoon until we say good-morning,' replied
the angry captain, and he left the room.
Charles de Monsigny was now in a violent passion.
The word coward had roused him to madness, and he
thought only of avenging the insult by committing one
of the greatest crimes of which a reasoning being can
be guilty. He, however, soon grew calm, went out to
dinner, looked in at the Opera, and then, requesting his
second to be with him at dawn of day, returned home,
and retired to bed.
6
It was a bright, clear morning, the sun had just risen,
the birds sang amid the trees of the Bois de Boulogne,
as Charles and his second drove up to the rendezvous.
A few minutes elapsed, and their adversaries appeared
in sight. A few minutes more, and four men were con-
cealed in an open glade in the wood, where they had
met for the express purpose of committing one or more
murders, as the case might be. Edgar and Charles
spoke not a word: their brows were knit angrily, and
while their seconds measured the ground and loaded
the pistols, they stood apart. Presently all was ready,
and they were about to advance to their places, when,
by a great effort, Charles forced himself to speak.
Gentlemen,' said he gravely, 'I beg you to bear
witness to the fact, that I fight this duel with M.
Warville entirely against my own feelings and wishes.
He is acting under a wrong impression, relative to
which I can now offer no explanation.'
'Sir, to your place!' replied Edgar furiously; 'your
life or mine!'
'Leave us, I command you!' said Edgar.
'And mine!' cried Adela, advancing from the cover of
the wood, and laying her hand upon her brother's arm,
She was; but had she been the veriest petite bour-if I have not come in time to prevent an assassination.'
geoise of the Rue Froidmanteau, she merited more
honourable treatment at your hands. Quite inexpe-
rienced in the world's ways, she went home to think
over your words, and to repeat them to Mme St Clair,
who, supposing you knew her rank, encouraged her
to think of you as one who might become her suitor
in earnest. But you came not'-
'I knew neither her name nor address '-
'You could have obtained both from M. Rubinet,'
continued the captain severely; 'but I pass that. You
met them you ran to meet them; made excuses for
your apparent neglect; took them a drive; talked for
three hours to my sister, and at parting said: "I shall
ask you next Thursday to decide the happiness of my
life."
'She told you that?' said Charles musing.
She told me nothing. When the evening passed
without your coming, the poor child, overcome by
disappointment, wounded pride, and grief, told it in
a passionate burst of tears to Mme St Clair, who
repeated it all to me, when I asked for an explanation
of her pallor and lowness of spirits. And now, mon-
sieur, that I have told you of my sister's weakness,
'No, I will not, until you have pledged yourself not
to take the life of my future husband.'
'Your future husband!' said Edgar wildly.
'Yes, monsieur, you force me, by your fierce and
savage humour, to accept him thus hurriedly,' replied
Adela blushing, but still looking him calmly in the
face; that is to say, if you, my natural guardian,
approve of this request made for the hand of the
petite bourgeoise.'
'O Adela, how generous, how kind!' cried Charles,
advancing and casting his pistol to the ground.
'Will you read this letter,' continued Adela, hand-
ing him a paper, which we received about ten minutes
after you left us yesterday in a towering passion?'
The captain took the letter. It was as follows:-
'MADAME-I have to apologise very humbly for my
unpolite behaviour towards yourself and your charming
ward. On two occasions, when I had the honour of
seeing you, I expressed a wish that we should meet
again, and, after receiving permission, did not avail
myself of it. It is not possible now for me to seek to
renew the acquaintance without some explanation. I

frankly own, that having been very much struck on
the first occasion by your ward, and on the second
having conceived for her a warm and sincere affec-
tion, I have from mere pride contended against the
feeling as long as I could. To marry into the bour-
geoisie is in my family considered an unpardonable
crime, and it is on account of this prejudice that I
have acted with such want of delicacy. But I am sure
your young ward is as good and generous as she is
beautiful, and I rely fully on her forgiving one who
seeks his pardon in a penitent spirit, and who frankly
owns his folly. I daresay the young lady has scarcely
noticed my conduct, it being naturally enough matter
of little importance to her. But her forgiveness is
necessary to the relief of my mind. I pray you, there-
fore, both to excuse my brutality and to allow me
to visit your house as the suitor of your ward. I
beg to address to you at once a formal suit for her
hand, hoping you will do your utmost to induce her to
receive my advances favourably. I have the honour
to be, with the most distinguished consideration, your
very devoted
CHARLES DE MONSIGNY.'
'But the duel?' asked Edgar.
"That project I betrayed,' said Mme St Clair, who had
reached the side of Adela while Edgar was reading the
letter. When this letter came, I at once owned that
you were gone to challenge him: but we feared to
fail in our attempt if we came not hither. We did not
go to bed, but watched all night near the count's house
in a carriage--you had not given your address-and we
drove here after you all.'
'Charles, my friend,' said Edgar offering his hand,
'will you forgive my hastiness? I now understand
the explanations you had to give.'
If you had not roused my anger I should have told
you of the letter'
And so, because your temper was roused, you were
going to kill my brother, were you, monsieur?'
6
'My dear Adela,' said the count, taking both her
hand and that of her brother, we have been very
wrong, but you must forgive us. Gentlemen, I am of
opinion that we should all adjourn without farther
delay to the best restaurant at hand, and sign the
treaty of peace over a solemn breakfast-one of our
old ones, Edgar, of the Rue Lafitte.'
'With pleasure,' replied Edgar laughing; and the
sooner I see the wedding-breakfast the better. I find
taking care of young ladies troublesome work, and
shall be very willing to transfer the responsibility to
other hands.'
'My dear brother-in-law,' cried Charles in the same
tone, though with a look of deep feeling, 'I accept the
responsibility with delight, and only wish it could be
assumed to-morrow.'
'M. le Count is in as great a hurry as he was to come
to our Thursdays,' said the little Adela maliciously.
The count defended himself as best he could, and
thus the conversation continued during the whole
morning.
The marriage took place within a day of the delay
required by the legal formalities. M. and Mme Hector
Rubinet were among the guests invited to the wedding-
breakfast. Both then and ever after the contrast
between the couples was marked. Hector sank from
the day of his marriage into a complete nonentity. His
wife ruled him without his ever venturing a murmur,
and he found his advantage in it. Having everything
in her hands, she took care of his fortune, and spent
money freely, but wasted nothing. Hector tried once
or twice to launch into speculations, but his wife stopped
him, and his children reaped the benefit. With all his
assumed knowledge of mankind, Hector was the most
easily gulled man in the world. Before his marriage he
had lost several large sums by putting faith in plausible
knaves. Charles, on the other hand, always enjoyed
the proud satisfaction of being looked up to by his
young wife with love and respect; but then he deserved
to be so, and every day of his life he blesses the
night when he dropped in to see THE BOURGEOIS
WEDDING.
WHY THE WINDS BLOW.
THE ancient Greeks, in their endeavours to account for
the winds, fancied them to be the breath of invisible
deities, who, living in different parts of the atmosphere,
blew gentle airs or furious blasts according to their
temper and disposition. There is something so pleasing
and poetical in this fancy that we cannot wonder at
finding it more or less prevalent among other nations
besides the Greeks; and to some minds the substi-
tution of reason for imagination in the study of the
winds is as unwelcome as the awakening from a rap-
turous dream. In later times we find Charlemagne
giving names to the winds, and a host of natural philo-
sophers following, with their peculiar speculations, in-
volving extraordinary mechanical and chemical causes,
down to our own day, in which we see 'wind reports'
every morning in the newspapers, and have meteor-
ological societies established, to investigate all aërial
mysteries. Readers in the present day need scarcely
be told that the generally-received theory regarding
the causes of winds is differences of temperature. Fara-
day's discovery of the magnetic condition of oxygen
has, however, opened a new view of the interesting
subject, which promises important results, and has
already enlisted numerous explorers. Among the
latter, Lieutenant Maury, of the observatory at Wash-
ington, whose discussions of the phenomena of the
winds have attracted much attention, has arrived at
certain conclusions, worthy of a little wider notice than
they are likely to meet with in the pages of the scien
tific journals in which they are published. By means
of wind-charts, projected by himself, he has been
enabled, to quote his own words, to trace from the
belt of calms, which extends entirely across the seas,
near the tropic of Cancer, an efflux of air, both to the
north and to the south. From the south side of this
belt the air flows in a never-ceasing breeze, called the
north-east trade-winds, towards the equator. On the
north side of it, the prevailing winds come from it also,
but they go towards the north-east. They are the
well-known south-west winds, which prevail along the
route from this country to England in the ratio of two
to one.' The question then arises, seeing that these
winds, passing from a warm to a cold climate, produce
more precipitation than evaporation- Where does the
vapour which these winds carry along come from?'
To estimate the answer rightly, there must be borne in
mind the existence of a zone of calms, known as the
Horse latitudes, where the aërial currents descend and
become surface-winds, and the difficulty of explaining
in what way the vapours borne by the winds traverse
this zone, since, if there were a mingling of currents,
the effect would be to superinduce alternate seasons of
drought and calm, extending over many years, instead
of the present ceaseless fluctuations. On this point
Lieutenant Maury observes: Seeing reasons why the
two currents should cross each other in the calms of
Cancer, and seeing no reasons why they should not, I
was led to the inference that here probably is a node in
the circulation of the atmosphere, where the wind from
the north meets the wind from the south, and that each,
after a pause, continues on in its course, and returns
again to complete the circuit,' pursuing its way towards
the pole as though it had not been interrupted. It
appears, moreover, that at the seasons of the year
when the sun is evaporating most rapidly in the
southern hemisphere, the most rain is falling in the
northern; whence the further inference, that the
extra-tropical regions of the northern hemisphere stand
in the relation of a condenser to a grand steam-machine,

327
the boiler of which is in the region of the south-east
trade-winds, and that the trade-winds of this hemi-
sphere perform the like office for the regions beyond
Capricorn.'
•
Proceeding on these conclusions, Lieutenant Maury
finds, in the trade wind region of the northern hemi-
sphere, the source of the rain-fall in Patagonia, which
has been known to exceed 150 inches in forty-one days;
and in that of the southern he finds the supply for the
Valley of the Mississippi. These facts serve to explain
the transport of volatile matters to great distances in
the atmosphere. Ehrenberg has reported that he
found South American infusoria in the blood-rains
and sea-dust of the Cape Verde Islands, and at Lyons,
Geneva, and other places; thereby shewing that the
trade-winds of the southern hemisphere, after arriving
at the belt of equatorial calms, ascend and continue in
their course towards the calms of Cancer; after passing
which they proceed towards the north pole from the
south-west, and enter the arctic regions in a spiral
curve, continually lessening the gyrations, until, whirl-
ing about in a direction contrary to the hands of a watch,
this air ascends and commences its return as an upper
current towards the calms of Cancer.' In the other
hemisphere the current 'approaches the antarctic
regions in a spiral, gyrating with the hands of a watch,
and contracting its convolutions as it draws nearer
and nearer the pole.'
At this point Lieutenant Maury, arguing from
Faraday's discovery referred to above, concludes that
the magnetism of the atmosphere is the cause of the
passage of these currents. It has been already ex-
plained in the Journal, that the magnetic condition of
oxygen differs in proportion to its temperature, and in
the general effect resulting therefrom is shown why
the air which has completed its circuit to the whirl
about the antarctic regions should then, according to
the laws of magnetism, be repelled from the south, and
attracted by the opposite pole towards the north.'
·
If we bring forward the phenomena of experimental
magnetism in illustration, it will be seen that their
evidence is most important. "Taking up, for instance,
the theory of Ampère with regard to the magnetic
polarity induced by an electrical current according as
it passes through wire coiled with or coiled against the
sun, and expanding it in conformity with the discoveries
of Faraday, we perceive a series of facts and principles
which, being applied to the circulation of the atmo-
sphere, make very significant the conclusions to which
the charts have led touching the continual whirl of
the wind in the arctic regions against, and in the
antarctic with, the hands of a watch.
and south magnetic poles the atmospherical nodes or
calm regions? In other words, are not the magnetic
poles of the earth in those atmospherical nodes, the two
standing to each other in the relation of cause and
effect?
'And have we not a clue already placed in our hands
by which the motion of the circular storms of the
northern hemisphere which travel against, and those of
the southern which travel with, the hands of a watch,
seems to be connected with the like motion of the wind
of each hemisphere in its circuit about its pole? And
will not this clue, when followed up, lead us into the
labyrinths of atmospherical magnetism for the solution
of the mystery?
'Indeed, so wide for speculation is the field presented
by these discoveries, that we may in some respects
regard this great globe itself, with its "cups" and
spiral wires of air, earth, and water, as an immense
"pile" and helix, which, being excited by the natural
batteries in the sea and atmosphere of the tropics,
excites in turn its oxygen, and imparts to atmosphe-
rical matter the properties of magnetism.
Thus, though it be not proved as a mathematical
truth that magnetism is the power which guides the
storm from right to left, and from left to right-which
conducts the moist and the dry air each in its appointed
paths, and which regulates the "wind in his circuits,"
yet that it is such a power is rendered so very pro-
bable, that the onus is now shifted, and it remains not
to prove but to disprove that such is its agency.'
HARTLEY COLERIDGE.
Ir is presumed that the name of Hartley Coleridge is
sufficiently well known to render some account of his
personal life and writings acceptable to the readers of
this Journal. There is, besides, an important lesson to
be derived from the contemplation of such a history—
a lesson of melancholy interest and of warning; for
here was a man endowed with noble gifts, and favoured
with many opportunities, but who has nevertheless left
in a great measure unfulfilled the brilliant promises of
his genius. What he might have been had he duly
disciplined his faculties, and been possessed of strength
enough to overcome the infirmities which he appears
to have inherited, it would now be futile to attempt to
ascertain; but that he was really capable of far higher
things than any which he accomplished is, we believe,
the testimony of all who knew him, and is even evident
from what he actually performed. The literary pro-
The view here thrown out has been further strength-ductions which he has left have, notwithstanding, high
ened by the magnetic experiments of Professor von
Feilitzsch, who had been struck by the different quality
of the disengaged magnetism' of a bar placed in a
certain position. To exemplify it he constructed spirals
with the wire peculiarly arranged, in which, if the
windings of the spiral took place in the direction of
the hand of a watch, then the end of it where the
current enters will become a south pole. If the cur-
rent is more feeble in every winding the nearer it is
to the centre of the spiral, then that half in which the
current enters, except the first winding, is attracted by
a south pole; but if the current is stronger in every
winding the nearer it is to the centre of the spiral,
then that half is repulsed by a south pole.'
Lieutenant Maury considers that an analogy may be
traced between these spirals and the spirals which the
currents of the wind in "his circuits" describe about
the earth. At the south polar calms, the atmospherical
spiral is with the hand of the watch, and, as in the case
of a spiral so wound about its helix, the magnetism is
south polar; and so mutatis mutandis for the regions of
north polar calms.
'May we not look, therefore, to find about the north
and be admired when many a noisier reputation is
claims to consideration, and are likely to survive
forgotten.
Hartley, the son of the celebrated S. T. Coleridge,
was born at Clevedon, a Severnside village in Somer-
setshire, a few miles from Bristol, on the 19th of
September 1796. His childhood, like the rest of his
life, was distinguished by many singularities. His
mother used to relate that when he was first taken
to London, being then a child in arms, and saw the
lamps, he exclaimed: "O now I know what the stars
are: they are lamps that have been good upon earth,
and have gone up to heaven!" His father designed,
as he said, to make him nature's playmate.' In one
of his most beautiful poems he says—
'I was reared
In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,
And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars;
But thou, my babe, shall wander like a breeze,
By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
Of ancient mountains, and beneath the clouds,
Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
And mountain-crags.'
A prophecy at least partially fulfilled, as Hartley him-
self acknowledged afterwards in a fine sonnet prefixed
to his first volume of poetry-
'Thy prayer was heard: I" wander'd like a breeze." ›
No fitter simile could be employed by way of describing
his entire outgoings and existence. From early infancy
he is described as one whose fancies from afar were
brought; and there seems to have been a general
impression in his family and among his friends that he
would grow up into a poet.
6
The child, as anybody can tell you out of Words-
worth, is father to the man.' The dreamy, wayward,
and unsettled character by which Hartley was all his
life distinguished was no doubt in a large degree deter-
mined by his early imaginative roamings; or perhaps,
more properly, it was determined by a too predominant
development of the mental qualities which predisposed
him to such vagaries. A judicious education-that is
to say, a course of discipline and culture calculated to
preserve a proper balance of the faculties—and which
in his case would have developed the understanding
more, and kept the fancy under reasonable restraint,
was evidently a needful thing for him. But Hartley
does not appear to have received anything like a judi-
cious education. His father, though a man of the finest
intellect, and of an affectionate and loving nature,
seems to have troubled himself very little about the
actual training of his children. He was always more
or less occupied with some colossal undertaking, which
he rarely had the steadiness to complete; or he was
roaming from place to place in an unsettled state of
health and prospects; and thus the little visionary, of
whom Wordsworth said-
'I think of thee with many fears
For what may be thy lot in future years'——
was left to wander like a breeze' whithersoever his
humour listed, gathering'shapes and fantasies which,
mixed with passions of his sadder years,' made up the
substance of his life.
From about seven years of age, and during a large
portion of his boyhood, Hartley resided with his uncle
Southey at Keswick. In 1808 he and his brother were
sent together to school at Ambleside, where, however,
it does not appear that Hartley distinguished himself
greatly by his scholarship. One of the chief advan-
tages which he seems to have derived from his school
life was the opportunity it afforded him of being
a good deal in the society of Wordsworth. Professor
Wilson, then residing at Elleray, also took notice
of him; as did Sir George Beaumont and Mr Basil
Montague. His biographer remarks: 'It was so, rather
than by a regular course of study, that he was educated--
by desultory reading, by the living voice of Coleridge,
Southey, and Wordsworth, Lloyd, Wilson, and De
Quincey; and again by homely familiarity with town-
folk and country-folk of every degree; lastly, by daily
recurring hours of solitude-by lonely wanderings with
the murmur of the Brathay in his ear.'* He was under
little restraint at school, and spent much time in loiter-
ing in the woods. His bodily feebleness hindered him
from joining in the active sports and pastimes of his
school-fellows; but he was a general favourite on
account of the interminable stories with which he
amused them on rainy days and winter nights. In the
meantime, as his brother observes, a certain infirmity
of will, the specific evil of his life, had already shewn
itself. His sensibility was intense, and he had not
wherewithal to control it. He could not open a letter
*Memoir by his brother prefixed to his poems.
without trembling. He shrank from mental pain: he
was beyond measure impatient of constraint. He was
liable to paroxysms of rage, often the disguise of pity,
self-accusation, or other painful emotion - anger it
could hardly be called-during which he bit his arm or
finger violently. He yielded, as it were unconsciously,
to slight temptations, slight in themselves and slight to
him, as if swayed by a mechanical impulse apart from
his own volition. It looked like an organic defect-a
congenital imperfection.' A certain awkwardness of
manner and behaviour likewise distinguished him.
His uncle Southey used to tell him he had two left
hands, and he ironically named him Job on account of
his impatience.
In some way, however, he grew up to the age of
nineteen, and was then sent to Oxford, in evident con-
sciousness of extraordinary abilities. In due time we
find him engaged upon a poem, by which he intends to
gain the prize for English verse. He, a poet's son, and,
according to all prophecy, called himself to be a poet,
it never occurs to him that he can fail in his laudable
and exciting object. But lo! now, on the day ap-
pointed, those uncritical college-dons award the prize
to another candidate! Whereupon Hartley is con-
founded - intensely, immeasurably disappointed and
astonished: where shall he hide his diminished head?
To this disappointment his brother traces all the
misfortunes of his afterlife; and there is no doubt that
it was the occasion and beginning of much that after-
wards went wrong with him. But nothing, surely, had
happened which any one could be justified in regarding
as an eternal humiliation; there was nothing to found
a 'great sorrow' upon: nothing, in short, which might
not have been practically and even cheerfully forgotten.
It was simply his first failure; and being only a failure,
why might he not have left it quietly behind him,
regarding it as an admonition to a higher stroke of
effort?
But this, it seems, was precisely what Hartley
Coleridge could not do. And here we detect the fatal
weakness which was probably the cause of all his
troubles: he has not the hardihood which can front and
overcome a disappointment. Unhappily he must cast
about for something to console his wounded self-
esteem; and so he goes to get shriven of his vexations
in a baptism of 'old port.' The enchanted cup once
tasted, its delights grow daily more enticing, and at
length the indulgence becomes a rooted and uncon-
querable habit. Then it was his misfortune to be a
brilliant talker;' and thus he became a sort of nota-
bility among the Oxford students, who, knowing his
relish for good liquor, were constantly inviting him to
wine-parties, for the sake of enjoying his conversation.
In this way much of his time at the university was
wasted. Still, it would appear, he must have had fits
of studious diligence, for he finally obtained what is
called a second class;' and some year or two later
was elected to a fellowship at Oriel, having passed the
examination with considerable distinction. The fellow-
ship, however, was made conditional on good-behaviour,
a year being fixed as the period of probation. One
would have supposed that Hartley, if not strictly
abstinent, might at least have managed to carry his
drink discreetly' for one brief twelvemonth; but no:
the habit is so confirmed in him that even the strong
inducement of a life-competency before him is not
enough to keep him temperate. At the end of the year
the fellowship was accordingly pronounced forfeited;
and poor Hartley, with his life-anchor thus rudely torn
away, sailed forth rudderless upon that wide uncertain
sea which is called the world.
The dignitaries of Oriel, to their great honour, con-
ducted their painful business with much delicacy and
kindness, generously making the interesting scapegrace
a present of L.300, by way of equipment for his
voyage. For two years after leaving Oxford he lived

in London, passing his time in writing for various
magazines, projecting graver works, cultivating friendly
relations, and occasionally embodying in verse the
incidents and impulses of the hour. The three sonnets
"To a Friend' with which his first volume opens are the
record of the delight which he experienced on meeting
with one who had sometime been the companion of his
mountain wanderings. We will quote the first by way
of giving a sample of his early poetry :-
'When we were idlers with the loitering rills,
The need of human love we little noted:
Our love was nature; and the peace which floated
On the white mist, and dwelt among the hills,
To sweet accord subdued our wayward wills;
One soul was ours, one mind, one heart devoted,
That, wisely doting, asked not why it doted;
And ours the unknown joy, which knowing kills.
But now I find how dear thou wert to me;
That man is more than half of nature's treasure,
Of that fair beauty which no eye can see,
Of that sweet music which no ear can measure;
And now the streams may sing for others' pleasure,
The hills sleep on in their eternity."
On quitting London he returned to Ambleside, and
undertook the management of the school in which he
had been formerly instructed. After four unpleasant
years, this mode of life was given up. He had not
expected much success in such a work, and writes
to his mother: 'I had a presentiment that it would
never do, and therefore your commendations seemed
like reproaches put out to interest. . . . . How could I
endure to be among unruly boys from seven in the
morning till eight or nine at night, and to be responsible
for actions which I could no more control than I could
move a pyramid?' From Ambleside he removed to
Grasmere, where he mused, and wrote, and rambled
according to inclination until 1832. In that year he
removed to Leeds, having made an engagement with
a publisher of that town to furnish materials for a
volume of poetry and another of prose. Out of this
arrangement sprung the publication of the first series
of his poems, and also his work called 'Biographia
Borcalis,' a collection of thirteen lives of renowned
northern countrymen. The latter originally came out
in numbers, and extended to upwards of 600 large
octavo pages. It has been described as being written
with much vigour and eloquence, abounding in pictu-
resque descriptions of events, as well as a dramatic
delineation of character, and enriched with many acute
remarks and original trains of thought.' Being com-
pleted in about a year, the work indicates on the part
of its author a power of continuous application under
favourable circumstances which the rest of his career
does not exhibit. Unhappily for Hartley, his publisher
became a bankrupt, and thus the engagement was
abruptly terminated.
"
Returning once more to Westmoreland, he took up
his abode in Nab Cottage,' on the banks of Rydal
Water, with some worthy people of the peasant class,
who, as the phrase is, took care of him.' Here he
mused, meditated, studied, and recorded his impressions
in prose and verse as his humour prompted, his days
gliding away almost without incident.
Mrs Wordsworth meanwhile kept a kindly eye upon
his movements, and often ministered unobtrusively to
his comfort. Without some such generous guardian-
ship there is no knowing into what straits poor Hartley
would have been precipitated. He was a perfect child
in regard to all matters of domestic or pecuniary eco-
nomy; and it seems doubtful whether he ever really
knew where the money came from which was paid for
his board and lodging. Being asked on one occasion
what he paid in rent, he was quite puzzled to find an
answer. 'Rent?' said he rent? I never thought of
that!' The little income provided by some of his
friends for his support was disbursed for him by Mrs
Wordsworth, who also appears to have doled out to him
his pocket-money, shilling by shilling, as he required
it. When his coat was getting threadbare or out at
elbows, a new one was ordered for him, and substituted
for the old one while he was in bed, and Hartley would
put it on the next day without remark, or indeed
without noticing the change. Almost the only part of
his expenditure which he seems to have managed for
himself were his disbursements made in the matter of
strong liquor. Often enough, after the manner of the
old lady who burnt her bed for the sake of a jolly fire,
he would exhaust his capital in some liberal libation,
and then find himself suddenly destitute of cash. To
procure a little loan on a thirsty morning he would
employ the most innocent and simple artifices, impos-
ing of course upon no one but himself. A writer in
'Fraser's Magazine' relates an amusing anecdote in
point: 'A friend of ours spending a summer at
Ambleside became very intimate with him. One day
Hartley ventured to borrow a shilling, volunteering to
repay it next day. Accordingly he came, made a long
call, talking, as his wont was, of dead and gone English
poems, steering clear of "The Splendid Shilling." At
last he rose to go, had got his hand upon the door: "By
the way," he said, "I have brought you your shilling'
"9
ransacking his pockets. Then with an air of surprise,
"No; I've forgotten it." Then, hesitating and blush-
ing: "And-and-and would you lend me another?"
Having got the shilling, off he went at full speed.
Every successive call the scene was repeated in the
self- same words.' One feels a little curious to know
whether Hartley ever repaid that shilling, or any
of the successive ones so borrowed. However, as the
same writer observes, one would have been glad to
have bought an hour's talk with him at the same price.
According to all testimony, his conversation was
exceedingly rich and genial. Like his father's, it was
generally a sort of monologue. Few people cared to
talk themselves when they had an opportunity of
listening to him. He had an extensive knowledge and
keen appreciation of our literature, especially of the
dramatic and poetical departments; and it was exceed-
ingly pleasant to hear him descant upon the character-
istics and excellences of this and the other writer
whom he admired, or to follow him through the mazes
of a discursive dissertation on things in general. His
tastes were very catholic and cordial, and he had the
heartiest relish for all possible degrees of excellence.
When he was satisfied with his company he would
discourse away for hours in a strain of originality,
humour, and paradoxical remark, which fully justified
the Westmoreland peasant's homely saying: 'Eh, but
Maister Coleridge do talk fine!'
In the spring of 1837 Hartley went for a few months
to supply the place of second-master in the grammar-
school at Sedbergh-a small market-town situated in
one of the valleys of the wild moorlands of north-
western Yorkshire. The duties of this post he is said
to have discharged with becoming diligence, and to
have conducted himself in other respects with great
discretion. When his services were no longer needed,
he went back to his old residence, and thenceforth
never left it. For many years he was one of the prin-
cipal notabilities of the Lake-country; and many were
the summer visitors who invited him to dinner, on the
understanding that he was to 'talk' for the pleasure of
his entertainers. His especial allies,' says the writer
in 'Fraser,' before quoted, were the Oxonians or Cantabs
who came to Ambleside by way of reading-young
fellows flush of money, light of heart, and entertaining
no very rooted antipathy to beer and cigars.' He was,
however, nowise exclusive in his choice of friends.
He mixed freely with statesmen,' farmers, peasantry,
and stood exceedingly high in their estimation. Where-
soever he turned himself he met with a cordial welcome.

Many are the stories told of his singular freaks and
misadventures. One relates how, on a certain night,
when he was rather more than commonly confused in
the faculty of eyesight, and extremely unsteady in the
legs, he had the perversion to fancy a ditch by a cloth-
dyer's mill to be his own feather-bed, and that, reposing
himself on that conviction, he arose the next morning
with the underside of his face dyed a rich Kendal
green!' At times he would strike off somewhere, and
remain away for days and even weeks, baffling all
search, and then suddenly return to his old neighbour-
hood haggard, torn, and penniless. Then, smitten with
remorse and shame, he would impose upon himself the
penalty of severest abstinence; though an infliction of
this sort was not uncommonly succeeded by a fit of
more reckless dissipation. Yet with all his irresolution
and instability of purpose, he never wholly ceased to
struggle against his perilous temptation. He would
enter in his diary the most touching and pathetic self-
accusings. From the depths of his degradation he
would arise in his right mind, but unhappily he never
acquired strength to withstand the renewed solicitations
of his besetment.
'What was 't awakened first the untried ear
Of that sole man who was all human kind?
Was it the gladsome welcome of the wind,
Stirring the leaves that never yet were sere?
The four mellifluous streams that flow'd so near,
Their lulling murmurs all in one combined?
The note of bird unnamed? The startled hind
Bursting the brake in wonder, not in fear,
Of her new lord? Or did the holy ground
Send forth mysterious melody to greet
The gracious pressure of immaculate feet?
Did viewless seraphs rustle all around,
Making sweet music out of air as sweet?
Or his own voice awake him with its sound?'
A rich and cultivated fancy, which in Hartley Cole-
ridge was more substantially developed than the
broader faculty of imagination, will not fail to be noted
and admired in the following:-
Is love a fancy or a feeling? No:
It is immortal as immaculate truth.
'Tis not a blossom, shed as soon as youth
Drops from the stem of life-for it will grow
In barren regions, where no waters flow,
Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom.
A darkling fire, faint hovering o'er a tomb,
That but itself and darkness nought doth shew,
Is my love's being-yet it cannot die,
Nor will it change, though all be changed beside;
Though fairest beauty be no longer fair,
Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,
And hope a spectre in a ruin bare.'
of space, we shall venture to quote the following on
'Music:'
All this is extremely lamentable; nevertheless, far
be it from us to judge poor Hartley harshly. Sympathy
and compassion are ever due to human frailty. Much,
too, may be said for him in the way of extenuation.
We must remember his disappointments, the exceeding
sensitiveness of his temperament, his acute suscepti-
bility to excitement, and the consequent liability to
its reaction the 'congenital imperfection' which so
strongly predisposed him to go astray. After all, the
error to which he was prone left but little abiding
stain upon his spirit. In spite of his besetting weak-
A pleasing yet pensive personal interest is attached
ness, he was a truth-loving, genial, affectionate, hopefulness of his heart. Though much straitened in point
to many of these poems. Hartley writes out of the
ful, and cordial-hearted man. With the light of genius
in his eyes, he had in his soul an authentic discern-
ment of the true, the just, the beautiful-a conscious
and inextinguishable love for whatsoever is good, and
great, and worthy. If for the truth's sake we have
been compelled to bring forth his errors and short-
comings somewhat nakedly into light, we will not
forget the manifold seductions that fostered his infir-
mity, nor the frequent, if unsuccessful, contests which
he inwardly waged against it. Let us tenderly regard
the weakness that could not successfully resist. Has
not Hartley paid the penalty?-paid it by a marred and
troubled life; by energies and hopes cast down and
broken; by the qualified commiseration and regret that
now hangs upon his memory. Looking at the treach-
erous slough into which, through unguardedness and im-
perfection, he fell, let it be remembered in our goings as
a warning to our own footsteps. For though we may
be nowise subjected to his particular temptation, there
is yet a lurking element of evil in our nature, the
knowledge of which should ever keep us humble, and
mindful of the sacred admonition 'Let him that
thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.'
Hartley's collected writings, though excellent in their
kind, must be regarded as being only fragments of his
genius. His poetry is of a fine order, though not
of the highest-partaking of the qualities which we
find in Wordsworth, and also of some of those which
distinguish the early verses of his father. It had
different characteristics at different periods of his life.
The poems of his youth display a rich though at times
a somewhat vague imagination, analogous to the
visionary sphere of feeling and existence in which so
large a portion of his early life was passed. Thoughts
of brilliancy and of beauty, yet often shadowy and
fantastic, like coloured clouds and vapours in a
summer sky, are to be found subtly and beautifully
embodied in free and graceful compositions. The
faculty of wonder was large within him; and, as an
illustration of the touching and original forms it took,
the following sonnet may be not unfitly quoted:-
Sweet music steals along the yielding soul
Like the brisk wind that sows autumnal seeds;
And it hath tones like vernal rain that feeds
The light green vale, ordained erelong to roll
In golden waves o'er many a wealthy rood;
And tones it hath that make a lonely hour
The silent dwelling of some lovely flower,
Sweet hermitess of forest solitude.
I loved sweet music when I was a child,
For then my mother used to sing to me:
I loved it better when a youth so wild,
With thoughts of love it did so well agree;
Fain would I love it to my latest day,
If it would teach me to believe and pray."
These quotations are confined to the sonnets,
because they appear to us to be the most complete
and finished portion of his works; but the rest of
Hartley's poetry is all similarly genial and beautiful.
A certain fulness of thought, a bright fancy, and a
kindly and hearty feeling for whatever is pure, just, and
gentle, is more or less manifest in everything he has
written. A wise sympathy, an appreciating recogni-
tion of all that ennobles and adorns humanity, and a
pervading and beneficent moral influence which flows
from him in almost all his moods, render his poems not
only charming but even edifying reading. We have no
room to dwell critically upon his many merits; but we
are altogether of opinion that his is poetry which the
world will not willingly let die.'
In his prose-writings Hartley Coleridge is generally
an intense but playful egotist. He acquaints his
reader with his most intimate caprices, and invites him
to the wildest and most surprising confidences. His
choice of subjects is extremely whimsical: now he will
discourse on the 'Character of Hamlet' or the 'Poetry
of Love,' and anon descend to a disquisition on 'black
cats' or 'pins,' and give you Thoughts on Horseman-
ship by a Pedestrian.' At times he writes with the

gravity and wisdom of a sage, and at others does not
scruple to disport himself with the broadest buffoonery
and fun. Whoever delights in smart wit, in quaint and
racy humour, originality of thought and observation,
sense, shrewdness, and whimsicality, will assuredly find
in Hartley's two volumes of 'Essays and Marginalia
abundant matter to instruct and fascinate and amuse
him.
ney; not one of the nobility, the gentry, or those who
travel in their own carriages, would like to be drawn
at the tail of a train of wagons in which some hundreds
of bars of iron were jingling; the noise and dirt would
be intolerable; cattle in fields would be frightened out
of their senses by the passing trains-and so on, with
a hundred other prognostications, coolly stated by
opponents before parliament. Not one of these pre-
cautionary terrors has proved well-founded - - all the
fears on the subject have been a delusion. In what a
mean light does this result place the prophesiers of
evil! In 1850 upwards of 70,000,000 of souls were
carried by railway, when only eleven passengers were
killed and fifty-four injured, or less than one to each
million of passengers conveyed.'
It only remains for us to close this sketch by a brief
allusion to Hartley's rather untimely death. He was
living his old life at Grasmere, when a fit of bronchitis
brought it suddenly to an end. In his last hours,'
says his brother, he took a clear review of his past
life; his words, whether addressed to me or to himself,
falling distinct on my ear; his mind appearing to
retain its wonted sagacity, and his tongue scarcely Looking back to old times, what a change in point of

railway at the last moment, are transferred to the

conclusion, that for a commercial people to whom time
is of value, ours is the best article; and if we had not
been a lawyer-ridden people, we might also have had
the cheapest article.'
RIDES ON RAILWAYS.
A SMART little book, profusely illustrated with engrav-piece of baggage; the lordly, commanding airs of
ings, has lately appeared with this title, and will prove
a useful, or at all events entertaining companion to
railway travellers. The work is well done, which is |
almost a singularity; for no department of literature
is so badly executed as the ordinary run of guide-books. |
To present anything like an account of the contents of
so varied a production is of course out of the question.
We can only point to a few specimens of the author's
descriptions, which we infer to be chiefly the result of
personal observation.
At the outset the writer recalls the remembrance of
the first proposal of railways, and the wise prophesies,
even among practical men,' that they could never
succeed. No train would be able to go quicker than
fifteen miles an hour-only three miles more than the
best stage-coaches; the railway would in most places
have to compete with canals for goods-traffic; few
people would like to risk their lives behind fiery
engines; no commercial travellers would go by railways,
because they would be away from towns on the jour-

A curious fact has been elicited in connection with
the cost of railways. It is the prodigious error com-
mitted by most companies as to furnishing accommo
dation for goods - traffic. The space required by the
principal lines has been so great that for this item
alone full 25 per cent. has been added to the original
estimates. George Stephenson calculated the cost of
getting over Chat Moss at L.40,000; his opponent
proved that it would cost L.400,000: but it was exe-
cuted at exactly the sum Stephenson set down, while
the capital involved in providing station-room for
merchandise at Liverpool and at Manchester has
probably exceeded the original estimate for the whole
line.' Much of the unforeseen increase in the goods-
department is due to the development of traffic in

rural produce-corn, cattle, sheep, milk, &c.-vastly to
the benefit of the agricultural interests. A regular
trade is now carried on between London and the most
remote parts of the kingdom in every conceivable
thing that will bear moving. Sheep have been sent
from Perth to London, and Covent-Garden has supplied
tons of the finer description of vegetables to the citi-
zens of Glasgow: every Saturday five tons of the best
fish in season are despatched from Billingsgate to
Birmingham, and milk is conveyed in padlocked tins
from and beyond Harrow at the rate of about one
penny per gallon. In articles which are imported into
Liverpool and London there is a constant interchange,
according to the state of the market; thus a penny per
pound difference may bring a hundred chests of congou
up, or send as many of hyson down the line. All
graziers within a day of the rail are able to compete in
the London market; the probability of any extraordinary
demand increases the number of beasts arriving weekly
at Camden Station from the average of 500 to 2000,
and the sheep from 2000 to 6000; and these animals
can be brought from the farthest grazing-grounds in
the kingdom without any loss of weight, and in much
better condition than the fat oxen were formerly driven
to Smithfield from the rich pastures round Aylesbury
or the Valley of the Thames.' The time has absolutely
come when it may be said that a farmer is to be pitied
who is out of reach of a railway. He is left, as it were,
out of the world.
The rides commence of course at Euston Square,
the metropolis of railways, and down goes the traveller
by the train to Birmingham. A few words are spared
for the principal places on the route and its adjuncts.
Thus of Bedford, of which something is said worth
noticing. Drolly enough, this is an example of a town
killed with kindness. Bedford has been pauperised
by the number and wealth of its charities. A mechanic
or small tradesman can send his child if it be sick to
a free hospital; when older, to a free school, where
even books are provided; when the boy is apprenticed,
a fee may be obtained from a charity; at half the time
of apprenticeship, a second fee; on the expiration of
the term, a third; on going to service, a fourth; if he
marries, he expects to obtain from a charity-fund "a
portion" with his wife, also educated at a charity; and
if he has not sufficient industry or prudence to lay by
for old age-and those are virtues which he is not
likely to practise-he looks forward with confidence to
being boarded and lodged at one of Bedford's fifty-nine
alms-houses.' The chief source of the charities of Bed-
ford is a large endowment by a wealthy alderman of
London, who would have done much better to have
spent his money upon himself than to leave it to demo- |
ralise succeeding generations.
Speaking of Banbury: the Buckinghamshire Rail-
way has reduced the price of coal to the inhabitants
from 22s. to 158. per ton on 150,000 tons per annum'
-a saving of upwards of L.50,000 a year to a single
town on one article! Opponents of railways, if there
be any left, can ponder this fact.
Next, as to Oxford, after some amusing matter
comes an observation on New College-new once, but
old now, for it was built by William of Wykeham in
1380 -a very respectable antiquity. Winchester
School, founded by the same worthy, is a sort of step
preliminary to the New College. Here is the way
things are managed :- Winchester School still retains
its ancient character for scholarship. (It is said to be
almost impossible to "pluck" a Wykehamist); but
the foundation has been grossly abused, the elected
being not poor boys, but the sons of wealthy clergy-
men and gentlemen, as indeed they had need be, for,
by another abuse, the parents of boys on the founda-
tion have to pay about L.40 a year for their board.
But when a boy, distinguished for diligence and ability
among his fellows, has been, at eighteen or nineteen |
years, elected to a fellowship of New College, his
work for life is done-no more need for exertion-
every incentive to Epicurean rest. Fine rooms; a fine
garden; a dinner daily the best in Oxford, served in a
style of profusion and elegance that leaves nothing to
be desired; wine the choicest; New College ale most
famous; a retiring-room where, in obsequious dignity,
a butler waits on his commands, with fresh bottles of
the strong New College port, or ready to compound a
variety of delicious drinks, amid which the New College
cider-cup and mint-julep can be specially recom-
mended. Newspapers, magazines, and novels on the
tables of both the junior and senior common rooms;
a stable for his horse and a kennel for his dog,
form part of this grand club of learned ignorance.
And so, in idle uselessness, he spends life, unless by
good fortune he falls in love and marries: even then,
we pity his wife and his cook for the first twelve
months-or, by reaction, flies into asceticism and
becomes a father of St Philip Neri or a follower of
Saint Pusseycat. But, after all this virtuous remon-
strance on the misdirection of William of Wykeham's
noble endowment, we must own that, of our Oxford
acquaintance, none are more agreeable than those
New College fellows of the old school," who wore
shocking bad hats and asked you to dinner." Much
better than the cold-blooded "monks without mass
who are fast superseding them, just as idle and more
ill-natured.'
As to the productions of Oxford: 'the only local
manufactures of Oxford, except gentlemen, are boots,
leather-breeches, and boats; these last in great per-
fection. The regatas and rowing-matches on the Isis
are very exciting affairs. From the narrowness of the
stream, they are rather chases than races; the winners
cannot pass, but must pursue and bump their competi-
tors. The many silent, solitary wherries, urged by
vigorous, skilful arms, give, on a summer evening, a
pleasing life to river-side walks, although that graceful
flower, the pretty pink bonnet and parasol, peculiar to
the waters of Richmond and Hampton, is not often
found growing in the Oxford wherry. Comedies, in
the shape of slanging matches with the barges, are less
frequent than formerly, and melodramatic fistic-combats
still less frequent. But old boatmen still love to relate
to their peaceable and admiring pupils how that pocket
Hercules, the Honourable S C now a pious
clergyman, had a single combat with a saucy six-foot
bargee, "all alone by they two selves," bunged up both
his eyes, and left him all but dead to time, ignorant
then, and for months after, of the name of his victor.'
Returning to the main line, the traveller reaches
Wolverton, a great eating-station, associated in our
minds with bad attendance, worse tea, worst barley-
broth, and an immense struggle to get at any. Wolver-
ton is exclusively a railway town, for manufacturing
railway articles, and is under railway government. It
is inhabited by a respectable and intelligent body of
mechanics. And what are the results of this colony,
in which there are none idle, none poor, and few un-
educated? Why, in many respects gratifying, in some
respects disappointing. The practical reformer will
learn more than one useful lesson from a patient inves-
tigation of the social state of this great village. Those
who have not been in the habit of mixing with the
superior class of English skilled mechanics will be
agreeably surprised by the intelligence, information,
and educational acquirements of a great number of the
workmen here. They will find men labouring for daily
wages capable of taking a creditable part in political,
literary, and scientific discussion; but at the same time
the followers of George Sand and the French preachers
of proletarian perfection will not find their notions of the
ennobling effects of manual labour realised. There are
exceptions, but as a general rule, after a hard day's
work, a man is not inclined for study of any kind, least

333
of all for the investigation of abstract science; and
thus it is that at Wolverton library novels are much
more in demand than scientific treatises. In summer,
when walks in the fields are pleasant, and men can work
in their gardens, the demand for books of any kind falls
off. Turning from the library to the mechanics' insti-
tution, pure science is not found to have many charms
for the mechanics of Wolverton. Geological and astro-
nomical lectures are ill attended, while musical enter-
tainments, dissolving views, and dramatic recitations
are popular. It must be confessed that dulness and
monotony exercise a very unfavourable influence on
this comfortable colony. The people, not being Quakers,
are not content without amusement. They receive their
appointed wages regularly, so that they have not even
the amusement of making and losing money. It would
be an excellent thing for the world if the kind, chari-
table, cold-blooded people of middle age, or with middle-
aged heads and hearts, who think that a population may
be ruled into an everyday life of alternate work, study,
and constitutional walks, without anything warmer
than a weak simper from year's end to year's end,
would consult the residents of Wolverton and Crewe
before planning their next parallelogram.'
Old-fashioned people will be glad to know that rail-
ways have not quite knocked up all the snug roadside
inns. One of these, at a place called Wansford in
England, is thus noticed :-'If about to investigate the
antiquities of Stamford or Peterborough, the traveller
will do well to stop at Wansford for the sake of one of
the best inns in Europe, well-known under the sign of
"The Haycock at Wansford in England." This sign
represents a man stretched on a floating haycock, and
apparently in conversation with parties on a bridge. It
is intended to illustrate the legend of Drunken Barnaby,
who, travelling during the time of the plague from
London northward, tasting and criticising the ale on
the road, drank so much of the Northamptonshire
brewst that he fell asleep on a haycock, in one of the
flat meadows. In the night-time a sudden flood arose,
as is often the case in this part of the country, and
our toper awoke to find himself floating on a great
tide of water, which at length brought him to a bridge,
upon which, hailing the passers-by, he asked, "Where
am I?" in full expectation of having floated to France
or Spain; whereupon they answered: "At Wansford."
"What!" he exclaimed in ecstasy, "Wansford in
England!" and landing, drank the ale, and gave a new
name to the inn of this village between three counties.
The inn—which belongs to the Duke of Bedford-affords
a sort of accommodation which the rapid travelling and
short halts of railways have almost abolished. But
an easy rent, a large farm, and a trade in selling and
hiring hunters, enables the landlord to provide as
comfortably for his guests as when, in old posting-days,
five dukes made the Haycock their night-halt at one
time. On entering the well-carpeted coffee-room, with
its ample screen, blazing fire, and plentiful allowance
of easy-chairs, while a well-appointed tempting dinner
is rapidly and silently laid on the spotless table-cloth-
the tired sportsman or traveller will be inclined to
fancy that he is visitor to some wealthy squire rather
than the guest of an innkeeper. When we add that
the bedrooms match the sitting-rooms; that the charges
are moderate; that the Pytchley, Earl Fitzwilliam's,
and the Duke of Rutland's hounds (the Beevor), meet
within an easy distance; that the county abounds in
antiquities, show-houses like Burleigh; that pleasant
woodland rides are within a circle of ten miles; that
good pike-fishing is to be had nearly all the year round;
while in retirement Wansford is complete; we have
said enough to shew that it is well worth the notice of
a large class of travellers-from young couples on their
first day's journey, to old gentlemen travelling north
and needing quiet and a bottle of old port.'
Here we would stop, but are tempted to give one
more extract. The passage refers to Dr Arnold and
the celebrated school at Rugby, to which he was ap-
pointed head-master. 'Dr Arnold, from the day on
which he first took charge of the school, adopted the
course which he ever after adhered to, of treating the
boys like gentlemen and reasonable beings. Thus on
receiving from an offender an answer to any question,
he would say: "If you say so, of course I believe you;"
and on this he would act. The effect of this was
immediate and remarkable; the better feeling of the
school was at once touched; boys declared: "It is a
shame to tell Arnold a lie, because he always believes
you;" and thus at one bold step the axe was put to
the root of the inveterate practice of lying to the
master, one of the curses of schools. In pursuance of
the same views, when reprimanding a boy, he generally
took him apart, and spoke to him in such a manner as
to make him feel that his master was grieved and
troubled at his wrong-doing; a Quaker-like simplicity of
mien and language, a sternness of manner not unmixed
with tenderness, and a total absence of all "donish"
airs, combined to produce this effect. Nor were his
personal habits without their effect. The boys saw in
him no outward appearance of a solemn pedagogue or
dignified ecclesiastic whom it was a temptation to dupe,
or into whose ample wig javelins of paper might with
impunity be darted; but a spare, active, determined
man, six feet high, in duck trousers, a narrow-brimmed
hat, a sailor's black handkerchief knotted round his
neck, a heavy walking-stick in his hand; a strong
swimmer, a noted runner; the first of all the masters
in the schoolroom on the winter mornings, teaching
the lowest class when it was his turn with the same
energy which he would have thrown into a lecture to a
critical audience, listening with interest to an intelli-
gent answer from the smallest boy, and speaking to
them more like an elder brother than the head-master.
They soon perceived that they had to deal with a man
thoroughly in earnest, acute, active, and not easily
deceived; that he was not only a scholar but a gentle-
man, who expected them to behave as the sons of
gentlemen themselves.' By these and other available
means the 'standard of intelligence and information
was incalculably raised, and the school, as a place of
education in its wider sense, became infinitely more
efficient."
SAVAGE NOTIONS OF PHILANTHROPY.
THERE are few more precarious investments than
spending money, time, or labour on other people's
affairs, with an eye to a speculative return in gratitude.
Those who have done so once will seldom knowingly
venture on a second experiment. If a man from the
feeling of simple benevolence feel inclined to bestow
benefits on his friends or neighbours, let him do so;
but if he is rash enough to imagine that his generosity
is likely to yield him large returns in gratitude and
good offices hereafter, he will find it a very poor
speculation indeed. When I hear a man complain-
ing of the ingratitude of some friend or relative to
whose interest he had sacrificed his own, I look upon
him as a disappointed speculator, not a disinterested
philanthropist.
Having from the period of my earliest recollections
been afflicted with an impulsive tendency to give away,
and to thrust kindnesses upon other people, I used to
feel very much puzzled to account for the fact, that when
I ventured to solicit a favour from those to whom I had
in my own way been most lavish, I was much less
likely to receive it than some one else who had given
them nothing. My eyes were for the first time opened
to the true state of the case by some incidents which
occurred to me while living among the half-savage
tribes who inhabit the jungly districts bordering
Nepaul.

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
There being no civil or military station within several
days' journey of where I was stationed, I had, in the
event of sickness or accident befalling my servants, to
prescribe for them what are usually included under
the name of domestic medicines. This was quite a new
field to me, and I went into it con amore; administering
pills, making poultices, and applying bandages, with
a zeal and energy very edifying to myself, and, as I
imagined, highly beneficial to my patients. This last
impression, however, was a gross delusion, as I sub-
sequently discovered.
One of my first patients was a tall, unwholesome-
looking youth named Bheem, who had charge of the
goats I kept for supplying my table with milk. Bheem
in his personal appearance and predacious instincts
made the nearest approach to what might be termed a
human weasel I ever saw. He had the sharp nose and
concave belly, and the same irrepressible tendency to
hunt up and devour small vermin which characterise
the weasel tribe all over the world. When Bheem
departed to the Moidhau with his goats at daybreak,
he was furnished, besides his gulell or pellat-bow, with
a number of odd-looking skewers and hooks, for
trapping and disinterring rats, hedgehogs, and porcu-
pines. The pellat-bow was used for shooting parrots
and squirrels; and it was seldom that Bheem returned
without some half-dozen rats or squirrels strung by
their tails to his girdle.
On one occasion, when in pursuit of a porcupine
which had taken shelter among the tangled roots of a
banian-tree, Bheem, having made up his mind that the
porcupine was to be cooked with chillies, garlic, and
gol meritch, became somewhat forgetful of his personal
safety, and having the animal at bay in a blind hole,
he was digging away with all his might to get at it,
when the porcupine rushed between his legs, tearing
them with his quills as he passed, and escaped.
Bheem came limping home at eventide in a very sad
plight, with his legs swathed with bandages of jungle-
grass over a plaster of chewed neem leaves. As a
matter of course, I took the legs under my care;
and had the satisfaction, after washing them every
morning with lukewarm water and applying poultices,
to see them gradually getting well again. But the
distinction of having his master to 'cook' his shins
every morning was too much for Bheem's head, and
he began to exhibit symptoms of self-conceit and arro-
gance among his fellow-servants, as if his getting his
shins scraped by a porcupine had been something
highly meritorious! After all pretence for looking at
his shins was over, he discovered a multitude of petty
ailments in his back, his sides, and his belly, for which
I gave him pills and powders without number. But
although he always professed to derive great benefit
from my dhoowys (medicines), he never got well;
and in all likelihood never would, if he had not picked
a quarrel with the cook, when it came out that
Bheem was in the habit of milking the goats on his
own account every evening before bringing them home.
This was the more provoking that, under the pretence
of feeding the young kids, I had frequently been
obliged to put up with short allowance of milk to my
coffee. On my taxing Bheem with his dishonesty, he
got on his knees, and in such terms of abject suppli-
cation as no language but Hindostanee can express,
besought me to forgive him; calling me 'gureeb-purwär'
('provider for the poor'), 'mai-bab' ('father and
mother'), 'malekgullam kei' ('owner of the slave'), &c.
All this I was prepared for and listened to as a matter
of course. But when the wretch proceeded to urge as
a farther reason for forgiveness, that he had brought
his legs to me to dress every day for a fortnight, that
he had taken all the medicines I gave him, and would
continue to take them as long as I liked, I was com-
pletely taken aback. As to being angry, that was out
of the question-indeed I felt quite as much ashamed
as angry. Under the pretence of acting the 'good
Samaritan,' I had been simply gratifying my thera-
peutical tendencies at Bheem's expense. That this
was the true philosophy of the matter was proved by
the fact, that in spite of the lesson which Bheem had
given me, I was led into taking as much interest in the
next case which occurred as if no such personage had
ever existed.
A little Hindoo boy of about ten years of age, who
had been assisting his father in mending the roof of a
brick-kiln, was, by the accidental giving way of the
side-walls, thrown among the hot bricks. His father
brought him to me literally half-roasted: his fingers
and toes, from his attempts to clamber out of the kiln,
had been burnt to cinders. His father cried, prayed,
howled, and wailed until he was hoarse. The poor
sufferer himself was only able to utter a low moaning
cry, which, although drowned for the instant in the
frantic vehemence of the father's grief, yet came out
with terrible distinctness whenever the old man ceased,
as he was sometimes obliged to do, from sheer exhaus-
tion. The remembrance of it makes me shudder even
now, although it is many years since.
As my slight knowledge of surgery had never before
been put to so severe a test, I felt correspondingly
embarrassed. Without pausing to consider the respon-
sibility I was incurring, I had the boy laid upon a bed
in the veranda and proceeded to apply such pallia-
tives as I could think of. Linseed-oil and lime-water
were procured and applied as fast as they could be
mixed. The poor little fellow seemed much relieved by
the cooling effect of this unguent, and sometimes inter-
mitted his sad cry to gasp Utcha! utcha!' ('Good!
good!') I had been occupied, I imagine, about two
hours with my patient, dressing his wounds and padding
him all round with loose cotton, to keep the air from
irritating the raw skin; having done this and got him
to swallow an anodyne, I looked about for his father,
intending to give him some directions concerning the
medicines I wished him to give his son. He, however,
was nowhere to be found! After sending people in
all directions in search of him, he was at last dis-
covered in his own house tranquilly kneading some
flour and water to make chepaties for his dinner, and
presented himself to me with his hands and arms still
covered with the flour he had been using. I gave him
a small punkah, and told him to sit down and drive
away the flies from his son's face; and in order that he
might not have occasion to leave the house again, I paid
another man to cook his chepaties for him and bring
them to him when ready. On going out to the veranda
half an hour after, I found the old man was again absent.
I began to feel rather angry; and when he made
his appearance some time afterwards, I began to scold
him for his carelessness, when he held up the cocoa-
nut shell and appendages which formed his pipe, to
intimate that he had been taking a smoke. I told him
he was at liberty to smoke as much as he pleased in the
veranda, but threatened, if I found him absent again,
to give him a sound thrashing. He promised not to stir
from his son's bedside, but on one pretext or another
he was constantly absenting himself. Sometimes he
had been to the bazaar to buy booja (parched rice);
sometimes he had gone to take a bath; sometimes he
had gone to consult a neighbouring Brahmin. In short,
there was no end to his excuses. What made this con-
duct appear more hideous was, that the flies came in
clouds about the bed; and unless driven away, covered
the poor boy's face and every other part of his body
exposed to them.
Now it was that the imprudence of my conduct
began to make itself felt. Here was my patient fast
sinking, while his father, whose natural duty it was to
attend to him, seemed to think that he had thrown the
whole responsibility on my shoulders; and in the event
of his son dying, he would certainly blame me for

having occasioned it. As neither threats, bribes, nor
entreaties could induce the old man to remain beside
his son, I had the poor boy placed in a palanquin and
carried to his own house, in the hope that when his
father had him under his own roof he would perhaps be
more disposed to attend to him. I went two or three
times daily to see him and dress his wounds. If the
old man was inattentive before, he was certainly no
better now, for whenever I called, I either found him
asleep or smoking at the door of his hut.
In all cases of severe injury from burning, after the
first excitement is over, there ensues an utter prostra-
tion of the whole system, and unless active measures are
taken to support the strength of the patient, he ulti-
mately sinks from exhaustion. After the second day the
poor boy ceased to complain, and lay apparently uncon-
scious of all that was passing around him. During the
few days he lived I was in a constant fever; wherever I
went I was haunted with the appearance of the dying
boy, and wondering whether the father was keeping the
flies away. I was positively relieved when a servant one
morning informed me that the brickmaker's boy was
dead. I found the old man seated by the embers of a
fire at the foot of the bed, his two hands grasping the
cocoa-nut shell of his hookah, from a hole in the side
of which he was sucking the smoke with a slow, solemn
glug-glugger, in which it would have been very difficult
to detect the accents of either grief or despair. Grief,
however, there was, deep and sincere of its kind; for
although the ear could not detect the slightest halt or
wavering in the steady march of the hookah's music,
the tears were raining from the old man's eyes and
falling in big drops at his feet. The indifference and
carelessness he had exhibited while his son was alive
had not prepared me for this; so feeling that I had
done him an injustice, I gave a few rupees to assist him
in fulfilling the funeral-rites.
In the next case which occurred I took care to avoid
the responsibility I had incurred in my last experi-
ment; and as I imagined successfully.
A poor woman, while employed with some others in
weeding a rice-field, left her child—an infant about
twelve months old-in a clump of long grass near the
skirt of the jungle. After she had been some time at
work her attention was directed to the spot where she
had left her child by hearing its screams. On running
towards it, she observed a large wolf dragging the child
in his teeth towards the jungle. The whole band of
weeders instantly started in pursuit, shouting and
screaming as they went. The wolf, finding he was
pursued, dropped the child, and made off. When
brought to me, beyond a few flesh-wounds from the
animal's teeth, the child was not so much injured as
might have been expected from the treatment it had
received.
ten days she came very willingly, when I renewed the
dressings, and gave her the three pice agreed on. At
the end of that time, finding the wounds were almost
all healed, I told her that she would not require to
bring the child to me any more. She looked rather
blank at this announcement, salaamed, and thanked me
in a very ceremonious manner. She was going on with
a long panegyric on my wisdom and generosity when I
interrupted her with: Well, well, that will do now-
go away, and mind to keep the child clean.' Still she
lingered, and kept swaying herself half round with the
child riding on her left hip. She had evidently some-
thing more to say, which she was mustering courage to
express. She commenced drawing circles among the
gravel with the toes of her left foot, and began with:
Khoodawund' (Master.')
'Well,' I answered, what have you to say?'
'Ap hakeem hy (You are a wise man.') I am a
poor woman: I have come to your honour every morn-
ing as you desired me. I brought you my child, and
gave it to you to put your medicines on it. I washed
it as often as you desired me: surely you will not send
me away?'
'Why,' I exclaimed, 'what could I do with you?'
But without heeding my interruption she went on:
'Surely you would not send me away-without some
buksheesh!'
I thought Bheem had been very ungrateful, but
surely this woman was something more.
A PRACTICAL COMMISSIONER OF SEWERS.
Or all places in the world, the London police-courts
afford the most curious revelations of civilised ethno-
logy. Hardly a week passes but some extraordinary
stratum of crime or misfortune, wherein human crea-
tures are found imbedded, and human nature petrified
or transformed, is brought to light.
The London newspapers lately chronicled the manner
of life of a man who, while we cannot call him criminal,
and have no right to deem him unfortunate, since he
appears to enjoy his own mode of existence as much as
anybody else would seem to have chosen a career
embracing a quintessence of vileness, misery, and
wretchedness. In a recent assault-case heard before
the magistrates at the Clerkenwell Court, this indivi-
dual appeared as a witness. His real name is said to
be Smith, but he has gained notoriety in the purlieus
of Field Lane, Saffron Hill, and other kindred localities,
under the sobriquet of 'The Jumper.' He is a rat-
catcher by profession, but follows his calling in a style
which places him apart from all his confrères in that

young kittens. His under-ground journeys extend for
miles. He has been under Newgate and along Cheap-
side to the Mansion-House, the roaring traffic above him
sounding like the dull rumbling of distant thunder.
He has traversed from Holborn to Islington, closely
inspecting all the divergent passages and odoriferous
tributaries which fall into the cloaca maxima of the
mighty metropolis. It is declared, indeed, that he
knows more about the sewerage of London and its
condition than any other living man, and that upon
the strength of such qualification he would make an
excellent chairman to the Board of Commissioners
sitting in Greek Street, under whose premises he has
so often rambled in pursuit of game.
It is recorded that on one occasion an obstruction
occurred to a drain at the foot of Holborn Hill, and
Jumper being known in the neighbourhood, was applied
to. Terms were speedily agreed upon. Jumper started
off to the foot of Blackfriars' Bridge, and in half an
hour his voice was heard down the gully-hole. He
quickly cleared away the obstruction, and received his
reward, which was well deserved, as he had saved the
public the expense and inconvenience of breaking up
the thoroughfare.
It is not, however, to the rats alone that Jumper
devotes his attention and industry. He frequently
falls in with rich windfalls-or, to improve the meta-
phor, waterfalls-especially in the City. On one occasion
he found a silk purse containing gold and silver; on
another a gold watch and seals; and he is constantly
rooting up silver spoons, rings, and other articles of
value.
Some time ago Jumper took on an apprentice, or
rather a pupil, for the profession-a man named Harris
-one bred to the horse-slaughtering business, and
who, after such a course of preparation, might be
supposed to have lost the sensitiveness of olfactory and
stomachic nerves to a sufficient degree to enable him
to enter on the new occupation. After a month's trial,
however, he gave it up as a bad job. I can stand a
tidy lot,' said he, somewhat crestfallen; but I can't
stand that 'ere!' So Jumper remains alone in his glory,
'monarch of all he surveys.' There is no man, how-
ever, who has not his trials: envy, jealousy, contempt,
interference, are the common lot. Jumper's right
has been disputed by a lord mayor, who threatened
him with imprisonment on the ground of trespass;
Jumper, however, still pursues his delectable calling.
He has been three times attacked with typhus fever,
but rapidly recovered on each occasion, apparently too
tough, tried, and tanned for the grim assailant.
Jumper may be seen on Sundays well dressed, and
generally with a watch in his pocket-presenting,
indeed, a comfortable and well-to-do appearance. It
may be added, that the rats bring him in from one
shilling to eighteenpence a dozen; and so conversant is
he with their haunts or burrows, that he requires but
a couple of hours' notice to produce any given quantity,
from a dozen to a hundred. This most extraordinary
character is, we believe, at present in good health, and
follows his calling with the greatest assiduity among
the foundations of the London streets.
DISCOVERY IN EGYPT.
A most interesting discovery has been made in Egypt.
It is known that there exists in Mount Zabarah, situated
on an island in the Red Sea, a mine of emeralds, which
was formerly worked by the pachas of Egypt, but
abandoned in the last years of the reign of Mehemet Ali.
An English company have solicited and recently obtained
authority to resume the working of this mine, which is
believed to be still rich in precious stones. Mr Allan,
the engineer of the company, while directing some
important excavations in this place, has discovered at a
great depth traces of an ancient gallery, which must
evidently be referred to the most remote antiquity.
Upon removing the rubbish, he found tools and ancient
utensils, and a stone upon which is engraved a hierogly-
phic inscription, now partially defaced. This circumstance
proves the truth of the opinion expressed by Belzoni, on
the strength of other indications, that this mine was
worked in ancient times. The nature and form of the
implements discovered, and the configuration of the
gallery, the plan of which has been readily traced, prove
most conclusively that the ancient Egyptians were skilful
has been discovered, that the first labours in the mine of
engineers. It seems, from examination of the stone which
Zabarah were commenced in the reign of Sesostris the
Great, or Rameses Sesostris, who, according to the most
generally-received opinion, lived about the year 1650
before Christ, and who is celebrated by his immense
conquests, as well as for the innumerable monuments with
which he covered Egypt.-American Literary Journal.
THE LETTER FROM HOM E.
BY THE REV. JAMES GILBORNE LYONS, I.L.D.
A YOUTHFUL stranger walk'd alone
In a great city's busiest place;
He heard not one familiar tone,
He saw not one familiar face:
He trod that long and weary street
Till day's last beam wax'd faint and dim,
But none were nigh to cheer or greet-
Not one was there to smile on him.
He saw before him thickly press
The rude, the beautiful, the proud,
And felt that strange deep loneliness
Which chills us in the selfish crowd:
Ay! though his heart was stern and strong,
And scorn'd each soft and wailing mood,
He felt a sore and saddening throng
Of doubts and wasting cares intrude.
While yet he mused in bitter thought,
A messenger appear'd at hand,
Who to that mourning pilgrim brought
A letter from his own fair land:
Eager as if it search'd a mine,
His eye the welcome page explor'd,
And, as he read each glowing line,
Hope, gladness, life, were all restor❜d.
Yet mightier than the voice from home,
Which nerv'd that drooping exile's breast,
Those words of Thine, Redeemer ! come
To calm our fears and give us rest.
When, in some sad and sunless hour,
We pine for smiles and tones of love,
They bid us look, through storm and shower,
To Thee our Light and Life above.

earnestly recommend to all who handle the pen-whether

Many plays have been thrown aside, many articles have
been returned, many prescriptions misinterpreted, and

VISIT TO AN ENGLISH MONASTERY.
I HAVE always felt a deep interest in monks and
monkery, and an interest that did not commence with
my historical period, but may be traced far back in the
fabulous Radcliffian era. I knew of course that there I was received by a venerable-looking monk, in a

the chronic revolution now going on, I had not alto-wrote my name in the visitors' book; and we then
gether withdrawn my faith from a French monk. But crossed a quadrangular court to the Guest-Hall, where
an English monk seemed highly improbable. I was tea and other refreshments had been prepared. While
once invited to visit the Benedictine convent at Ham-gazing round me like a man in a strange country, a
mersmith; but that was quite too much. Hammersmith! swell of music rose suddenly upon my ear.
As if a name like that was compatible with a genuine
convent! Besides, I myself knew the sister of the
abbess; and a nice, kind, frank little lady she was,
who drank tea and spoke prose as like other people as
possible. Such considerations set the Benedictines
completely out of the question; but my curiosity, after
a hard struggle with my unbelief, was at length aroused
by the reports that reached me from time to time
concerning another religious establishment. This was
the monastery of Mount St Bernard in Leicestershire
-a sufficiently probable name, it must be confessed,
notwithstanding its associations with fat cattle and
improved breeds. Perhaps the considerable distance of
the county from my usual place of abode formed an
element in the feasibility of the thing; but at anyrate
I did send a missive to the Fathers, to acquaint them,
in what I was told was the prescribed form, with my
intention to pay them a visit; and half-interested, half-
pooh-poohish, I actually set out for an English monas-
tery. My letter was forwarded through the penny-post;
I travelled myself by rail.
On arriving at the nearest station, which is six miles
from the abbey, I found that the good Fathers had
provided a conveyance for me, drawn by a pony, and
driven by an Irishman. The pony was sedate and slow,
as became a conventual horse; and the Irishman was
in a hurry neither with his words nor actions, but sat
quietly on his box like a monumental figure of
Resignation. The consequence was that the shades of
evening fell thickly around us before our arrival, and
that seen through them the adventure began to look
respectable. I was on my way to a monastery-to the
monastery of St Bernard. I was to eat in its refectory,
to pray at its vespers, to sleep in its dormitory. In
England, it is true, where the people would mob a
Capuchin as they would a Bloomerite; and in a county
where short horns are the chief local celebrities: but
no matter. The evening was dark and preternaturally
silent; and when at length we stopped at a large,
'It is the brethren in the choir,' said the guest-
master, observing me start, who are finishing their
evening devotions. That is the "Salve Regina,” or
hymn to the Virgin; and when I hear its last
cadence, my day is at an end, and my lips must no
more open except in prayer.' When the solemn
chant died away, a bell rang, called the angelus, and
the guest - master and his assistant, a lay-brother,
immediately facing about, sank on their knees before a
fine picture of the Crucifixion. Here they said their
angelus; and the guest-master, who had missed the
service in the choir in consequence of his attendance
upon me, went through his office-apparently a long
ritual before rising from his knees. During this
interval-though hardly feeling that it was germane to
the place and time I was busily engaged, at the
pressing instance of the lay-brother, in discussing a
very interesting tea and delicious omelet.
-

When the monk had finished his devotions and I my
refreshment, he laid a book before me, and pointing to
a section, seemed to desire that I should read it. It
proved to be a short lesson on monastic obedience; and
when I had finished, he conducted me to the cloisters,
and through them to the church, a large and gloomy
edifice, lighted only by the dim but ever-burning lamp
of the sanctuary. It was from this building I had heard
the solemn swell of the Salve Regina,' given forth
by the united voices of forty monks; but now our own
footsteps were the only sounds that broke the awful
stillness of the place. The monk, with his muffled
figure, and slow, calm pace, went on before me into the
choir, and knelt before the altar. This appeared to be
the sole purpose for which he had entered the church,
since he could hold no communication with me; and
as I stood behind his motionless figure, and watched
the faint play of the solitary lamp, lost in the profound
darkness beyond, a feeling akin to superstitious terror
took possession of me. I do not know how long the
silent monk remained on his knees, but it must have

been a considerable time; and when at length he rose
and glided away as before, I followed him with a
sensation of relief. I followed him out of the church,
across the quadrangle, and into the bedroom where I
was to pass the night; when my conductor, waving
his hand in adieu, left the room, and I found myself
alone.
Alone, in a real monastery, inhabited by real monks
-and all this in England! The idea was not easily
grappled with. At first view the thing was improbable:
but there I was. There was nothing unreal in the fire
that blazed before me, and threw a flickering light into
the room; nor in the roof, with its black rafters; nor
in the small tent-bedstead, with its drab moreen
curtains the livery of the monks themselves; nor in
the prie-dieu, with the prayer-desk by its side, standing
on the uncarpeted floor; nor in the dressing - table,
looking-glass, and stone fender; nor in the pictures of
the saints, that moved and nodded in the fitful light
upon the walls: but somehow the real was mingled
with the unreal; and as I sat staring into the fire, I saw
distinctly the shadows of the Confessional of the Black
Penitents; and once I turned fairly round to look for
that mysterious monk who had appointed to meet
with the young Montorio in a similar place. Perhaps
the reader remembers that as the hour of tryst
approached, Montorio became impatient, and looked
eagerly round the empty room for his expected visitor;
till, on raising his eyes again as the clock struck, he
beheld the monk calmly seated at the table, with his
eyes fixed on the dial.
I sat thus for a considerable time, immersed in wild
but pleasing imaginations, and at length went to bed
and fell asleep. Then my waking thoughts were
repeated in my dreams, and I was following through
some dark corridor a tall, dim, gliding figure, when
suddenly my steps were arrested, and my sleep broken
by the deep tones of a bell. I found it was one o'clock;
and this doubtless was the sound that summoned the
monks to matins. I thought drowsily for a time of the
heroism of their devotion; but sleep was once more
descending on my eyes, when a slow and dolorous
chant stole across the courtyard and through my little
pointed window, and I could distinctly hear the voices
of the monks sending on high their morning-hymn.
The cadence had scarcely died away, when I was again
in the land of dreams; but after a time-it might have
been two or three hours-the deep solemn bell awoke
me anew, sounding, as I was afterwards told, for
prime; and as it continued at intervals I slept no more.
At half-past six I heard a knock at my door; and
on answering Come in,' a strange figure entered,
enveloped in a dark habit, and looking not unlike one
of the witches in 'Macbeth.' He carried a light, a long
brush, and a coal-box; and after having kindled the
fire and swept the hearth, was about to retire, when I
asked him a question concerning the weather. His reply
was merely to put his finger on his lips, and with an
unintelligible growl he left the apartment. I may
mention here, what I learned afterwards, that there
were eight bedchambers, all uniform with the one I
occupied.
Shortly after, the guest-master appeared with a jug
of hot water, and cheerfully wished me good-morning,
hoping I had slept comfortably. He informed me that
breakfast would be ready at half-past eight, but that
high-mass was performed in the church every morning
at half-past seven, at which all the guests were expected
to be present. After breakfast the abbot himself would
come and bid me welcome, and he requested me to be
in my room to receive him. After the guest-master
had taken his departure, I got up and made my toilet,
during which process the bell struck thrice-the premo-
nitory signal, as the guest-master had told me, for mass,
and intended to give the priests time to put on their
After this the bells rang at two intervals,
vestments.
as they did for all the other services, and I proceeded
to the church. I was shewn into the rood - loft, the
place appropriated for the guests, and found two or
three before me. The monks were all in their stalls
reciting a short preliminary office, and the priests were
at the altar, which was prepared with six large lighted
candles and other paraphernalia, for the performance
of high-mass. This, it seems, was a festival-day, and
the abbot was to sing high-mass himself. The office
being over, the priests went into the sacristy, from
which they soon returned in procession, accompanied
by the abbot in his pontificals, including the mitre and
crosier, and preceded by his cross-bearer and acolytes,
or boys bearing lights and incense. Shortly before the
conclusion of mass a monk brought us books interlined
with music, which I perceived were the Processionale
or ritual of processions. Accordingly, at the conclusion
of mass, a procession moved round the church and
cloisters, which the guests, wound up to a pitch of
sentimental excitement at least I can answer for
myself-did not dare to refuse joining. The chanting
continued during the procession until we regained the
church, when a short service was performed at the
altar; and so far as we were concerned the religious
service of the morning was at an end, when we hastened,
cold and hungry, into the guest-hall, where a plain
breakfast awaited us. The only thing worth notice in
the meal was, that it included no meat, that being an
article which is strictly prohibited from entering the
monastery.
-
After breakfast, mindful of the injunctions of the
guest-master, I retired to my room, to be ready to
receive the visit of the abbot; and it was not without
some feeling of excitement I awaited the approach of
the reverend head of this singular establishment. I am
happy to say he looked the conventual dignitary to the
life; being a venerable old man of at least eighty
years, much attenuated, as if worn away with watching
and fasting, and rather decrepit. Having been informed
that the ceremony was customary, I knelt before
him with unfeigned respect and humility; and when
he had pronounced his benediction, I rose from my
knees, thinking that I should derive good and no evil
from an old man's blessing. In conversation, however,
I must say I found him not only simple but ignorant.
He had been a member of the Church of England; but
entering the service of a Roman Catholic family in
early life, he had become a convert to the religion he
now professed, and afterwards taking the vows, had
lived to find himself the head of his order in England.
When the abbot left me, the guest-master came by
appointment to take me through the establishment.
First, there is the gate-house already mentioned, con-
taining a great hall, an almonry, kitchen, porter's
lodge, and two or three small rooms, besides four
sleeping-apartments. From this the first quadrangle
is entered, one side of which is formed by the gate-
house, one by the infirmary and apartments for the
infirmarian, another by the great church, and the
fourth by the guest-hall, the apartments of the
abbot and prior, and several guest-rooms. A passage
leads from the guests' apartments to the cloisters,
which form another quadrangle, whence branch the
library, chapter-house, dormitory, refectory, kitchen,
and sacristy. From the cloisters there are two
entrances into the church; and in the centre of this
quadrangle is the burial ground, where a grave is
always kept open to remind the brethren of their latter
end. A passage leads from the cloister to a third
quadrangle, containing the workshops, bakehouse,
brewhouse, dairy, and other domestic offices.
The principal officers of the monastery are the abbot,
prior, subprior, housekeeper, two masters of novices,
and two guest-inasters. All these, with the exception
of the masters of novices, have the liberty of speech
before the angelus in the evening; but the other monks,

numbering forty, and chiefly from Ireland, are con-
demned to a much more stringent silence. They are
not permitted to speak even to each other without
special leave from the superior; and they can only
make known their wants by prescribed signs. Their
food consists of only one meal in the day, and that is
restricted to vegetables; while they are not allowed a
fire even in winter. Seven services, all in Latin, are
performed in the church during the day and night, and
on Sunday there is a sermon delivered. All these may
be attended by any one who chooses, the great west
gates being always open; but the secular part of the
church is divided from the regular by the rood-screen.
When finished, this part of the building will consist of
nave, aisles, transept, and choir; although at present
only the nave is completed, with its six altars. Nine
of the monks are priests.
The dress of the choir-brothers consists of a light drab
habit reaching to the feet, with a black scapulary, and
a cowl or hood. The scapulary consists of two bands
of woollen stuff, the one crossing the shoulder, and the
other the stomach. It is supposed to have been origi-
nally a heavy covering worn by the early hard-working
monks for carrying loads on their shoulders, although
afterwards it was considered as a sign of peculiar
devotion to the Virgin Mary. The dress of the lay-
brothers is brown, and they do not wear the cowl.
Both classes have leathern belts round the waist. They
wear no linen, and they wash and shave only once a
week. Every Friday morning they perform what is
called 'discipline,' which consists in lashing their backs
with a whip of many thongs, while one of the brothers
recites the fifty-first psalm, Miserere mei. During my
visit one of them wore an iron chain with sharp spikes
round his waist and next his skin; but this individual,
I hear, has since then deserted the monastery, and taken
refuge in Protestantism. Every night before complin or
the last office, a chapter is held, at which the brethren
have to confess to their superior what they have thought
of during the day; and if their thoughts do not meet
his approval, or if they inform him of any breach of
rule committed either by themselves or another-such
as genuflecting with the right knee instead of the left
-certain penances are awarded, one of which is for the
transgressor to lie down at the church-door and permit
his brethren to walk over him. If a brother comes late
into the refectory, he has to proceed to the head of the
room and stand with his back bent until the hammer
of the superior calls him to his place; or if any mistake
is made in the choir by sounding a wrong note, or
singing a wrong antiphon, the erring brother, as soon
as he finds he has done amiss, proceeds at once to the
front of the altar, where he prostrates himself till the
superior's hammer recalls him to his stall. The monks
are not permitted to have any will of their own;
what they are required by their superior to do must be
done. They are frequently required to pray for what
the superior desires in his own mind, without being at
all acquainted with what that desire is. I heard one
of the brethren who was permitted to speak declare,
that if he was ordered by the superior to go out to sea
in an open boat without oars or sails, he should feel it
his bounden duty to do so. During their novitiate
they are put to the most revolting proofs of their humi-
lity. A clergyman of the Church of England visited
this monastery, and became so enamoured of its holy
life, that he gave up his curacy and joined the order.
The first thing the abbot set him to do was to assist in
removing the night-soil; and he afterwards went on his
knees before the father to thank him for putting his
humility to such a test. In fine, the monks wash their
own clothes and do every domestic duty for them-
selves, besides attending to a large farm connected with
the monastery, on which there are many sheep and
oxen, a mill, and blacksmiths and carpenters' shops,
all conducted by the industrious brethren.
One more trait of monastic life and I have done.
During my visit, the whole community came pouring
one day in solemn procession upon my quarters. The
visit was somewhat alarming; for, immured as I had
been in that strange, unworldly existence, I was by no
means sure at the moment that I was not a monk
myself, and in sudden terror I began to rummage my
conscience for what I had done. But the procession
stopped at the next room to mine, which had been
tenanted by a guest like myself, an Irish priest, who
had no sooner taken his leave and got out into the
world, than he rushed straight into the bosom of the
Protestant Church. The business of the procession
was to sprinkle the desecrated room with holy-water;
and I heard from those of the brethren who had the
use of their tongues many expressions of mingled pity
and horror at the fall of the unfortunate man.'
My unbelief was now removed, my curiosity satisfied,
my longings at rest. I had seen the triumph of the
mediæval tendency of the time, and the cravings of
Young England satisfied. I had seen an English monas-
tery; and mingling with some natural pride at the idea
that we were not outdone in religious austerity by
other nations, or even by the personages of the Rad-
cliffian period, there came a secret feeling of satisfaction
that I was one of those who were permitted to live,
move, and have their being outside.
DROLLERIES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.
FORESTALLING AND REGRATING.
IF there were anything new under the sun, it might be
supposed that Socialism is new; but it is not so, and
we are about to shew that our ancestors were arrant
Socialists - - at least, that they adopted the essential
principles of Socialism. These consist in an artificial
interference with commerce and employment, and a
minute regulation of all the transactions of the citizen,
arising from the belief that people cannot take charge
of their own affairs, and that the state, or the wise men
who 'shape the whisper of the throne,' must do it for
them. The same thing, it may be said, was exemplified
on a later occasion during the first French Revolution,
when a baker or a grocer was occasionally hanged from
the lantern-rope in front of his door for selling his goods
at a price higher than that fixed by the Committee of
Public Safety, or for giving up business when he found
that he could not continue it without ruin. But it is
generally admitted that the acts of the Reign of Terror
were done in spite and hatred towards the owners of
property or the inheritors of respectability, rather than
with a view to justice and the benefit of the public.
Socialists and Communists do profess to seek the public
benefit, and many of them are zealous and honest in
their profession. In like manner, those who legis-
lated for our ancestors sought the public benefit with
pains and care-with deep pondering-with earnest
efforts to overcome difficulties, and heavy mortification
when each attempt only plunged them and the people
they tried to serve into difficulties more and more inex-
tricable. We believe that a slight sketch of the tender
mercies which the people of England received at the
hands of these zealous friends, a sketch derived from
the most authentic sources acts of parliament and
other legal documents-will make the general reader
rise somewhat astonished from the perusal.
The crimes of forestalling, regrating, and engrossing
occupy a very large space in the English Statute-book
and in the old treatises on criminal law. A foreigner,
studying our jurisprudence, might wonder where these
dreadful crimes have gone to, since of late they have
disappeared from the legal nomenclature. Forestalling,
in its very earliest use, had a formidable meaning. We
turn to Chambers's Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,'
the earliest English encyclopædia, and there we find-
'Forestal, in Domesday wrote forestel, is an intercepting

in the highway, or stopping or even insulting a passen-
ger therein.' It came afterwards, however, to have no
stronger meaning than the word 'anticipate,' unless,
as some maintain, its Saxon origin would always give it
greater strength than a word of classical derivation;
and in this sense Milton and Shakspeare often use it,
as where the former says:
Why need a man forestall his day of grief,
And run to meet what he would most avoid!'
In trade, it meant stopping a man on his way to
market, and buying his goods for the purpose of trading
in them. Regrating meant the purchasing of the
modities with the same object after they had reached
the market. Blackstone describes it as the buying of
corn or other dead victual in any market, and selling it
again in the same market, or within four miles of the
place; for this,' says the great law-authority, en-
hances the price of provisions, as every successive seller
must have a successive profit.' Engrossing included
both these offences, and referred to all instances in
which goods were bought on a large scale to be resold
by retail. An engrosser was not always a criminal; it
was lawful to engross foreign merchandise when it was
not paid for in gold, and to retail it in England. The
word has had a rather curious history. The term
grocer, now applied to a retailer of tea and sugar, was
of old used solely to designate these great foreign
merchants. They were men of mark, and some of them
were ennobled such as Lionel Cranfield, who became
Earl of Middlesex. Thus many scions of noble houses,
when looking into their genealogies, are not a little
startled, if not scandalised, to see the most distinguished
of their ancestors set forth as So-and-so, 'of the city of
London-grocer.'
<
permitted to those who import wines, wares, or mer-
chandises in vessels, to sell them in gross or by retail,
or by parcels at their will, to all manner of people who
will buy the same.' But then follows the prohibition,
that no merchant, privy [native] nor stranger, nor
other, of what condition that he be, go by land or by
water towards such wines, wares, or merchandises
coming into our said realm and lands, in the sea nor
elsewhere, to forestall or buy them, or in other manner
to give earnest upon them before that they come to the
staple, or to the port where they shall be discharged,
nor enter into the ships for such cause, till the mer-
com-chandises be set to land to be sold.'. Against trans-
gressors of this and other similar restrictions the
punishment denounced is--demembration or death,
Notwithstanding this and other penal acts, com-
modities would be dearer than statesmen thought they
ought to be. There seemed, then, to be no remedy
but the actual fixing of prices. This was attempted in
1533 by a statute of 25th Henry VIII. The preamble,
which we give in the precise words in which it is to
be found in the Statute-book, if it appear to be discon-
nected in composition, is rational enough in principle.
Forasmuch as dearth, scarcity, good, cheap, and plenty
of cheese, butter, capons, hens, chickens, and other
victuals necessary for man's sustenance, happeneth,
riseth, and chanceth of so many and divers occasions,
that it is very hard and difficult to put any certain
prices to any such things.'. One would think this a
very excellent reason for not attempting to put prices
on them, yet it is precisely what the statute does
attempt. Before doing so, however, the preamble
leaves this reasonable tone, and waxes wroth thus:-
Yet, nevertheless, the prices of such victuals be many
times enhanced and raised by the greedy covetousness
and appetites of the owners of such victuals, by occa-
sion of engrossing and regrating the same, more than
upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the
great damage and impoverishing of the king's subjects.'
To remedy this, certain high officers of state-consisting
of the lord-chancellor, the president of the council, the
lord privy-scal, &c.--are to have power and authority
from time to time, as the case shall require, to set and
tax reasonable prices of all such kinds of victuals above
specified, how they shall be sold, by gross or by retail,
for the relief of the king's subjects; and after such
prices set and taxed in form aforesaid, proclamation
shall be made in the king's name, under the great seal,
of the said prices.' And then follows a command, that
all farmers, owners, broggers, and all other victuallers
whatsoever, having or keeping any of the said victuals,
to the intent to sell the same to such of the king's
subjects as will buy them, at such prices as shall be
set and taxed by the said proclamation, upon the pains
to be expressed and limited in the said proclamation.'
Our readers may have occasionally seen ordinances of
the Chinese authorities, especially since the commence-
ment of our closer intercourse with the Celestial Empire.
They are usually of a vague character, denouncing all
aggrandising, oppressive, or selfish actions, but not
specifying, as all sound laws ought to do, the exact
crime that is to be punished. The following statute of
the year 1306 (34 Edward I.) strikes us as being very
much in the Chinese style :-
No forestaller shall be suffered to dwell in any town
who manifestly is an oppressor of the poor and a public
enemy of the country-who, meeting grain, fish, her-
ring, or other things, coming by land or by water to be
sold, doth hasten to buy them before another, thirsting
after wicked gain, oppressing the poor, and deceiving
the rich; and by that means goeth about to sell the
said things much dearer than he that brought them:
who cometh about merchant-strangers that bring mer-
chandise, offering them help in the sale of their wares,
and informing them that they may sell their wares
dearer than they meant to have done, and by such craft
and subtlety deceiveth a whole town and a country.
He that is convicted thereof the first time shall be
amerced, and lose the things so bought, according to
the custom of the town; he that is convicted the
second time shall have judgment of the pillory; the
third time, he shall be imprisoned and ransomed; the
fourth time, he shall abjure the town; and this judg-
ment shall be given upon all manner of forestallers,
and likewise upon them that have given them counsel,
help, or favour.' Thus we see that the seller of com-
modities was deemed a public enemy, whom it was
every one's duty to relieve of his property at the
smallest possible price. To hint to him that the market
was rising, and advise him to hold on,' as it is termed,
for a better price, rendered one liable to imprisonment
and the pillory.
But such gentle punishments had not been effectual;
and forty-five years afterwards, in the 27th of Edward
III., a whole string of sanguinary statutes was passed
to make goods cheap. By one of these it is graciously
We have historical evidence that such proclamations
were actually made. Strype, in his Memorials of the
Reformation,' under the year 1549, states that 'all
provisions this year grew very dear, and the prices of
victuals so enhanced above the accustomed value, and
this without ground or reasonable cause.' The high
officers of state above referred to then set about making
a list of prices to be proclaimed. Strype mentions the
scale fixed for cattle and sheep, of which the following
is a specimen :-Steers or runts, being primed or well
stricken, and large bone, 20s.; of a meaner sort, 16s.;
being fat, of the largest bone, 258.; being fat, of a
meaner sort, 21s.; heifers and kine, being primed and
well stricken, and large of bone, 168.
In mentioning a subsequent proclamation, the histo-
rian of the Reformation enlarges his list to the prices
of butter and cheese. The pound of sweet-butter was
to be three-halfpence, and barreled butter was not
to be sold to any of the king's subjects under three
farthings. Yet all this statesmanship did not put
matters right. As Strype continues to say: But this

-
dearness still continuing in the realm, notwithstanding
all former endeavours (partly by reason of conveyance
of commodities beyond sea, and partly by men's buying
up of corn in the market to be sold again, and also by
not bringing any quantities to the market), the king
issued out yet another proclamation, dated September
24th, signifying in the preface how the insatiable
greediness of divers ill-natured people, neither minding
the due obedience of good laws nor any preservation
of natural societies within their own country, and
contrary to the provision of divers good laws and
-statutes, by frequent unlawful exportation of victuals,
and by many detestable frauds and covins, had occa-
sioned great scarcity and unreasonable prices of
victuals.
The next remedy was of the most stringent and
inquisitorial character; and it would be curious to
witness how the free agriculturist of the present age
would feel on finding himself no longer neglected by
the legislature, but subject to such intervention as the
following:-Committees of justices were to be appointed
who were to repair to all farms, barns, stacks, and
garners; and there to view and try out, as well by the
verdict of honest men as by good and lawful means,
what kind and quantity of grain every person had
within their respective divisions; and after the certainty
thereof known, or as near as could be, they were to
allot and appoint to the owners of the corn and grain
sufficient and competent for the finding and maintenance
of their houses and payment of their rent-corns, and
performance of any bargains for supply of the king's
majesty's house, or to any nobleman, gentleman, or
others, for the only maintenance of his or their house-
hold, until the 20th September then next coming, and
also for necessary seed-corn. And the overplus of such
grain the justices shall have authority to charge and
command them, in the king's name, to bring to the
markets next adjoining, and that in such portions as
the justices shall think fit. And then the justices were
to signify unto the chief officer or officers of the respec-
tive markets what quantity of grain is appointed to
every man within their limits to bring to market. And
if the owner of such corn should refuse to bring to
market his corn, he should forfeit for every such default
L.10, and suffer imprisonment for three months.'
Strype's commentary on this proclamation is in the
following few but emphatic words: 'But notwith-
standing there came but little corn to markets.' It
was to remedy this that the statutes against intercepting
goods in the way to market, or purchasing growing
corn or other dead victual' with the intention of selling
it again, were passed. The penalties were, for the
first offence, two months' imprisonment and forfeiture,
and obstinate offenders were pilloried,
Let us now give a casual glance at the way in which
these laws were put in force. The national misgiving
against bad laws is often curiously shewn in a sort of
general conspiracy by judges, jurors, and witnesses, to
give them as little force as possible. The people who
make it their business to help in the execution of the
laws, the common informers, are received with contempt
and contumely; and not only to baffle them in their
attempts to support the law, but to inflict on them
heavy costs, appears to give infinite satisfaction to the
sworn guardians of the law. Even parliament itself,
in passing its stringent statutes, sometimes gave a
snarl at those who made it a business to see that they
were no dead letter; and an act of the 5th and 6th of
Edward VI. proceeds on the preamble, that traders
for butter and cheese for the city of London are con
tinually vexed and molested by common informers,
sometimes upon the one statute and sometimes upon
the other.'
The old books of reports are full of actions on the
statutes, generally decided on quibbles. In many of
them there are long arguments on such questions as
whether apples, nuts, or plums, come under the term
'dead victuals.' The decisions were generally against
the informers. But the great metaphysical difficulties
arose when the forestaller changed the nature of the
goods. If one bought so many quarters of barley from
a farmer and sold them again, he was liable to be
punished; but what if he had before the sale converted
the barley into malt? or what if he had still further
altered its nature by grinding it? The climax of the
difficulty, however, arose where one had bought grain
and converted it into starch. This great question came
before the Court of Exchequer in 1611, in the case of
'Bridgman qui tam v. Collins.' The proceedings were
at the instance of a common informer, and the plead-
ing of Hitchcock of Lincoln's Inn' for the defendant
is curious enough, as the following specimen will shew:
He contended that the starch is not the same in
number nor quality; but he agreed that if wheat be
only ground, that this notwithstanding is within the
statute; but if it be made into bread and then sold, it
is not within the statute, for then it is another body,
and other things added to it; and the form is also
altered, and the form gives the being and the name:
and if water be turned into wine, it is no water though
it be by miracle. So if a person be made a bishop, he
is not the same person, for honours change manners.'*
Few things escaped the legislative determination to
put down trading profits. Thus in 1552 an angry
statute denounces and punishes the covetousness of
divers greedy persons regrating and engrossing all
kinds of tanned leather into their hands, and selling the
same again at excessive prices to saddlers, girdlers,
cordwainers, and such other artificers and handicrafts.'
But it would be only tedious to enumerate any more of
these pertinacious and vexatious statutes. It was not
until the year 1772, four years before the publication
of the Wealth of Nations,' that reason appeared to
dawn upon the legislature. In that year many of the
penalties against forestalling were repealed, under the
preamble: Whereas it hath been found by experience,
that the restraints laid by several statutes upon the
dealing in corn, meal, flour, cattle, and sundry other
sort of victuals, by preventing a free trade in the said
commoditics, have a tendency to discourage the growth
and to enhance the price of the same, which statutes,
if put in execution, would bring great distress upon the
inhabitants of many parts of this kingdom.' It was
not, however, until the year 1844 that the last linger-
ing vestiges of the statutes against forestallers and
regraters were swept from the Statute-book.

THORVALDSEN'S FIRST LOVE.
SOME fifty-five years ago, a young woman of prepos-
sessing appearance was seated in a small back-room of
a house in Copenhagen, weeping bitterly. In her lap
lay a few trinkets and other small articles, evidently
keepsakes which she had received from time to time.
She took up one after the other, and turned them over
and over; but she could scarcely distinguish them
through her blinding tears. Then she buried her face
in her hands, and rocked to and fro in agony.
'Oh!' moaned she, and is it come to this? All my
dreams of happiness are vanished-all my hopes are
dead! He will even go without bidding me farewell.
Ah, Himlen! that I have lived to see this bitter day!
Lovet være Gud!'
At this moment a hasty tap at the door was followed
by the entrance of the object of her grief. He was a
young man about twenty-five years of age, his person
middle-sized and strongly-built, his features massive,

regular, and attractive-his long hair flaxen, his eyes
blue. This was Bertel Thorvaldsen-a name which
has since then sounded throughout the world as that
of the most illustrious sculptor of modern times. His
step was firm and quick, his eye bright, and his
features glowing as he entered the room; but when he
beheld the attitude of the weeping female a shade
passed over his countenance as he gently walked up to
her, and laying his hand on her shoulder, murmured:
'Amalie!'
'Bertel!' answered a smothered voice.
The young Dane drew a chair to her side, and
silently took her tear-bedewed hands. 'Amalie,' said
he, after a pause broken only by her quivering sobs,
'I am come to bid thee farewell. I go in the morning.'
She ceased weeping, raised her face, and releasing
her hands, pushed back her dishevelled hair. Then she
wiped her eyes, and gazed on him in a way that made
his own droop. Bertel,' said she in a solemn tone, but
void of all reproach-' Bertel, why did you win my
young heart?-why did you lead me to hope that I
should become the wife of your bosom?'
'I-I always meant it: I mean it now.'
She shook her head mournfully, and taking up the
trinkets, continued: 'Do you remember what you
said when you gave me this-and this-and this?'
'What would you have, Amalie? I said I loved
you: I love you still-but'-
Only promise this: when you are hereafter in the full
blaze of your triumph, sometimes turn aside from the
high-born, lovely dames who are thronging around, and
drop one tear to the memory of the lowly Danish girl
who loved you better than herself. Bertel, farvel!"
The next day Thorvaldsen quitted Copenhagen for
Rome, where he resided nearly the whole remainder of
his long life, and more than realised his own wildest
aspirations of fame. But the prophecy of poor
Amalie was literally fulfilled-he never more beheld
his parents, nor her, his first true love!
Nearly half a century had elapsed, and again the
scene was Copenhagen. The streets were densely
crowded with eager, sorrowing spectators, and every
window of every house was filled with sadly-expectant
faces. At length the cry, 'They come!' was echoed
from group to group, and the crowds swayed to and
fro under the sympathetic swell of one common emotion.
A withered old woman was seated at the upper
window of a house, and when the cry was taken up,
hands over her eyes, as though to clear away the mist
she raised her wrinkled countenance, and passed her
of more than seventy winters. An immense procession
drew nigh. Appropriate military-music preceded a
corpse being conveyed to its last earthly abiding-place.
The king of the land, the royal family, the nobility,
the clergy, the learned, the brave, the gifted, the
renowned, walked after it. The banners of mourning
were waved, the trumpets wailed, and ten thousand
sobs broke alike from stern and gentle breasts, and
tears from the eyes of warriors as well as lovely women
showered like rain. It was the funeral of Bertel
'But you love ambition, fame, the praise of men far Thorvaldsen, with the Danish nation for mourners!
better!' added she bitterly.
And she, the old woman who gazed at it as it slowly
Thorvaldsen started, and his features flushed; for wound by-she was Amalie, his first love! Thor-
he felt acutely the truth of her words.
"
Yes, you will leave gamle Danmark-you will leave
your poor, fond, old father and mother, whose only hope
and only earthly joy is in you-you will leave me, and
all who love the sound of your footstep, and go to the
distant land, and forget us all!'
Min Pige! you are cruel and unjust. I shall come
back to my old father and mother-come back to thee,
and we shall all be happy again.'
'Never, Bertel!-never! When once you have gone
there is no more happiness for us. In heaven we may
all meet again; on earth, never! O no, never more
will you see in this life either your parents or your
poor broken-hearted Amalie!'—and again her sobs
burst forth.
Thorvaldsen abruptly rose from his chair, and paced
the room in agitation. He was much distressed, and
once or twice he glanced at Amalie with evident hesita-
tion. His past life, the pleasures of his youth, the
endeared scenes and friends of his childhood, the
affection of Amalie, the anguish of his parents at the
approaching separation, all vividly passed in review,
and whispered him to stay and be happy in the city
of his birth. But a vision of Rome rose also, and
beckoned him thither to earn renown, wealth, and
earthly immortality. The pride of conscious genius
swelled his soul, and he felt that the die was cast for
ever.
He rescated himself by the side of Amalie, and once
more took her hand. She looked up, and in one glance
read his inmost thoughts. Go,' said she, go and
fulfil your destiny. God's will be done! You will
become a great man-you will be the companion of
princes and of kings, and your name will extend the
fame of your country to the uttermost parts of the
earth. I see it all; and let my selfish love perish!
valdsen had never married, neither had she.
'Ah, Himlen!' murmured the old woman, wiping
away tears from a source which for many long years
had been dry, how marvellous is the will of God! To
think that I should live to behold this sight! Poor,
poor Bertel! All that I predicted came to pass; but,
ah me! who knows whether you might not have enjoyed
a happier life after all had you stayed with your old
father and mother, and married me. Ah, Himlen, there's
only One can tell! Poor Bertel!'
Four years more sped, and one fine Sabbath morning
an aged and decrepit female painfully dragged her
weary limbs through the crowded lower rooms of that
wondrous building known as Thorvaldsen's Museum.
She paused not to glance at the matchless works
of the sculptor, but crept onward until she reached
an open doorway leading into the inner quadrangle, in
the mortal remains of him whose hand created the
the centre of which a low tomb of gray marble encloses
works which fill the edifice. Step by step she drew
close to the tomb, and sank on the pavement by its
side. Then she laid down her crutch, and pressed her
bony hands tightly over her skinny brow. Ja, ja!'
murmured she; they told me he lay here, and I prayed
to God to grant me strength to crawl to the spot-
and He has heard me. Ah, Himlen, I can die happy
now!'

shoulder, thinking she was asleep. Her body gently
slid to the ground at the touch, and he then saw that
she slept the sleep of death!
THE SNAKE-PLANT OF SOUTH AMERICA.
VENOMOUS Serpents abound in all the tierras calientes
(hot lands) of America. The frequent fatality following
their bite-particularly among the Indians, who roam
barefoot through the tangled woods-renders the
knowledge of any counteracting remedy a matter of
great importance to these people. In consequence,
much diligence has at all times been used in seeking
for such remedies; and many, more or less efficacious,
have from time to time been discovered.
--
That of surest virtues yet known is a plant called
the guaco-
the sap of whose leaves is a complete
antidote against the bite of the most poisonous reptiles.
The guaco is a species of willow. Its root is fibrous,
the stem straight and cylindrical when young; but as
it approaches maturity, it assumes a pentagonal form,
having five salient angles. The leaves grow lengthwise
from the stem, opposite, and cordate. They are of a
dark-green colour mixed with violet, smooth on the
under surface, but on the upper rough with a slight
down. The flowers are of a yellow colour, and grow in
clusters each calyx holding four.
The corolla is
monopetalous infundibuliform, and contains five sta-
mens uniting at their anthers into a cylinder which
embraces the style with its stigma much broken.
The guaco is a strong healthy plant, but grows only
in the hot regions, and flourishes best in the shade of
other trees, along the banks of the streams. It is not
found in the colder uplands (tierras frias); and in this
disposal nature again beautifully exhibits her design,
as here exist not the venomous creatures against whose
poisons the guaco seems intended as an antidote.
That part of the plant which is used for the
snake-bite is a sap or tea distilled from its leaves.
It may be taken either as a preventive or cure: in
the former case, enabling him who has drunk of it
to handle the most dangerous serpents with impunity.
For a long time the knowledge of the antidotal quali- |
ties of the guaco remained a great mystery, and was
confined to a few among the native inhabitants of
South America. Those of them who possessed the
secret were interested in preserving it, as through it
they obtained considerable recompenses, not only from
those who had been bitten by venomous snakes, but
also from many who were curious to witness the feats
of these snake - tamers themselves. However, the
medicinal virtues of the guaco are now generally
known in all countries where it is found; and its
effects only cause astonishment to the stranger or
traveller.
were both teeth and fangs in their perfect state; and
yet the animals did not make the least attempt to use
them. On the contrary, they seemed to exhibit no
anger, although the negro handled them roughly. They
appeared perfectly innocuous, and rather afraid of him
I thought.
Determined to assure myself beyond the shadow of
a doubt, I ordered a large mastiff to be brought into
the room and placed so that the snakes could reach
him. The dog was sufficiently frightened, but being
tied he could not retreat; and after a short while one
the neck. The dog was now set loose, but did not

at first appear to notice the wound he had received.
In two or three minutes, however, he began to limp
and howl most fearfully. In five minutes more he fell,
and struggled over the ground in violent convulsions,
similar to those occasioned by hydrophobia. Blood
and viscous matter gushed from his mouth and
nostrils, and at the end of a quarter of an hour by the
watch he was dead.
Witnessing all this, I became extremely desirous of
possessing the important secret-which, by the way,
was not then so generally known. I offered a good
round sum; and the negro, promising to meet my
wishes, took his departure.
On the following day he returned, bringing with him
a handful of heart-shaped leaves, which I recognised
as those of the bejuco de guaco or snake-plant. These
he placed in a bowl, having first crushed them between
two stones. He next poured a little water into the
vessel. In a few minutes maceration took place, and
the 'tea' was ready. I was instructed to swallow two
small spoonfuls of it, which I did. The negro then
made three incisions in each of my hands at the forking
of my fingers, and three similar ones on each foot
between the toes. Through these he inoculated me
with the extract of the guaco. He next punctured my
breast, both on the right and left side, and performed a
similar inoculation. I was now ready for the snakes,
several of which, both of the coral and cascabel species,
the negro had brought along with him.
With all my wish to become a snake-charmer, I
must confess that at sight of the hideous reptiles I felt
my courage oozing through my nails.
The negro,
however, continued to assure me; and as I took great
pains to convince him that my death would cost him his
life, and I saw that he still entreated me to go ahead,
I came at length to the determination to run the risk.
With a somewhat shaky hand I took up one of the
corals, and passed it delicately through my fingers.
All right. The animal shewed no disposition to bite,
but twisted itself through my hands, apparently
cowering and frightened. I soon grew bolder, and
took up another and another, until I had three of the
reptiles in my grasp at one time. I then put them
down and caught a snake of the cascabel species---
the rattlesnake of the north. This fellow behaved in
a more lively manner, but did not shew any symptoms
Being at Margarita some time ago, I heard of this of irritation. After I had handled the reptile for some
singular plant, and was desirous of witnessing the test minutes, I was holding it near the middle, when, to my

convinced me of this by opening the mouths of both,
and shewing me the interior. There, sure enough,

a fresh sup of the guaco tea, and waited tremblingly

expiration of a few hours it had completely subsided,
and I felt that I was all right again.
On many occasions afterwards I repeated the expe-
riment of handling serpents I had myself taken in the
woods, and some of them of the most poisonous species.
On these occasions I adopted no farther precaution
than to swallow a dose of the guaco sap, and even
chewing the leaves of the plant itself was sufficient.
This precaution is also taken by those such as
hunters and wood choppers-whose calling carries
them into the thick jungles of the southern forest,
where dangerous reptiles abound.
The guaco has no doubt saved many a life. The
tradition which the Indians relate of the discovery of
its virtues is interesting. It is as follows:-In the
tierras calientes there is a bird of the kite species-a
gavilan, whose food consists principally of serpents.
When in search of its victims, this bird utters a loud
but monotonous note, which sounds like the word
gua-co slowly pronounced. The Indians allege that
this note is for the purpose of calling to it the snakes,
over whom it possesses a mysterious power, that
summons them forth from their hiding-places. This
of course is pure superstition, but what follows
may nevertheless be true. They relate that before
making its attack upon the serpent, the bird always
eats the leaves of the bejuco de guaco. This having
been observed, it was inferred that the plant possessed
antidotal powers, which led to the trial and consequent
discovery of its virtues.
ance.
MRS GRIMSHAWE'S GARDEN.
THERE stood a few years since on a certain road leading
from the village of Morton a cottage, or, more properly
speaking, a small house of a most lugubrious appear-
There was nothing promising about it, at least
not in my eyes; for it was a straight, narrow house,
with a slated roof, common chimneys, and windows of
every variety of size and shape, and no two alike.
There were no climbing-plants nor bright flowers
about it; and the piece of ground in front, though of
tolerable size--being about sixty feet by forty-four-
was surrounded on two sides by lofty walls, on the
third by the dull cottage, and on the fourth by the
turnpike-road, separated from it by a low wall with a
crazy gate. Right in front of one end of the house
stood an old stone barn, occupying a considerable
part of this piece of ground, and obscuring some of its
windows, as it reared itself at not more than six feet
from them; and when I add that the aspect was
north-east, I think it will be apparent that there was
but little of an attractive character about the place.
It was therefore with no small surprise that I heard
of an invalid lady having fallen in love with this
'Castle Dolorous,' and purchased it after one hasty
inspection; and it will be credited that the curiosity
of our little country neighbourhood was soon at high
tide to make out what she was going to do with it.
It was understood that the interior state of the house
was neither brighter nor better than its exterior; and
it was soon decided on all hands that whatever else
the poor invalid might do, she would soon repent of
her bargain. But Mrs Grimshawe, it seems, thought
otherwise she shewed no symptoms either of repent-
ance or disgust; on the contrary, she appeared to exult
in the idea of her future home, and might be seen
daily, even before she could obtain possession, standing
in pleased contemplation of her new domain. The
very day she received the key of her door she set to
work. The barn had been already removed, for it seems
she had made that a stipulation in her contract; and
now masons and carpenters, painters and paperers,
were speedily sent in; and as soon as a sitting and
bed room for the lady, and a bedroom and kitchen for
her maid could be arranged, Mrs Grimshawe made her
entry, utterly regardless of the state of everything
around her. The garden was now one pool of mud,
diversified by a few wells of mortar, heaps of stone,
and other building-materials, and the house-door could
only be reached by stepping from plank to plank and
from stone to stone. Over these mud-heaps, however,
the invalid lady contrived to climb, and ensconced
herself among her works; and soon the wonderfully
changed appearance of those rooms which had under-
gone renewal gave token of the improvements which
might be expected in the course of time without; and
though all was done in a simple and very inexpensive
style, and the furnishing and fitting-up were some-
what old-fashioned, there was an air of comfort and of
home diffused through the whole which led to the idea
that Mrs Grimshawe had an eye for detecting capa-
bilities, and a mind which would not be daunted by
petty difficulties.
It
But Mrs Grimshawe's garden is the subject we have
to discuss, and not her house. Of the future state of
this she seemed to have some very pleasing previsions.
She appeared to have it all before her mind's eye,
redolent of perfumes, glowing with flowers, a place
where she might walk, and sit, and meditate, and from
which the greatest enjoyment and credit would accrue
to her. But when I left Morton in November, such as
I have described was the dismal state of this rather
swamp than garden; and I confess I somewhat pitied
the poor visionary, and doubted how far her hobby
mire amid which her imagination was at work. I was
would carry her before it left her floundering in the
several months from home, and some weeks elapsed
after my return before my steps were turned in the
direction of Mrs Grimshawe's garden; but at last I
bethought me of the shabby cottage and its adven-
turous tenant, and one evening in July I set out-
resolved to have a peep at what was going on.
was, however, some little time before I could fairly
discover what I was in search of: not because the
cottage did not stand where it stood when I last saw
it, but because all about and around was so changed
in aspect that when I stood in front of it I really
could scarcely persuade myself that it was the same
spot. Never was there such an alteration. A light
iron railing, raised on a wall about three feet in height,
from which sloped inwards a bank of emerald turr,
separated the road on which I stood from a perfect
placed so as to shroud the entrance-gate, was a mound
mass of verdure and brilliancy. In one part, and
enamelled with low-growing ferns, stonecrops, hyperi-
of rockwork crowned with flowering shrubs, and
cum, and other plants of bright hues; whilst a single
small tree of elegant growth rose from the side of the
gravel-walk which passed down one side of the little
domain, just so as to break the line of the house, and
cast a light shadow on some of the exquisitely-tinted
flowers, that, shimmering in the evening sunlight, filled
the nicely-cut flower-beds intersecting the smooth
climbing-plants clothed the lower part of the house,
green turf.
A light tracery of brilliant - coloured
and a pretty porch had been added; the walls were
partially clothed with similar bright raiment; and,
to crown all, there stood the same form which I had
so often beheld contemplating the mud-pools, now
apparently wrapped in admiration of the results of her
labours.
as much altered as her garden! Instead of the pale,
broken-down invalid, who I used to fear would never
live to see the fulfilment of any of her plans, I beheld
a bright, comparatively healthy-looking dame, who,

for every rose she had planted in her garden, seemed
to have planted two in her cheeks. I really was so
struck with admiration and astonishment that I quite
forgot myself, and stood gazing until, rather to my
shame, I met the eyes of the owner fully turned upon
me, and as it was evident that she had not forgotten
me, I found myself obliged to speak and apologise for
my rudeness. A cordial invitation to come within the
works was speedily given and accepted.
But how, my dear madam, did all this change take
place?' said I. You must have surely purloined
Aladin's lamp, for nothing less wonderful is this than
was his magic palace.'
'Well, my dear,' replied Mrs Grimshawe laughing,
my cot is certainly improved; and I think I have suc-
ceeded pretty well in convincing the croakers who so
much lamented over me and my prospects, and who
thought I shewed more conceit than wisdom when I
predicted that my house would be habitable and my
garden pretty. But, O dear! it is nothing to what I
mean it shall be in a year or two, if it please God I
live, and go on with my plans!"
And here the good lady began to call my notice to
this shrub and that creeper, which was hereafter to
make such and such shoots, and fill such and such
spaces; but as it was with the past my mind was busy,
and I really wished to know how my friend had set to
work, and what means she had used to effect the
change so rapidly, I begged her to enlighten me on
these points, telling her that I also had a dismal
cottage, and should like to transform it into a paradise,
if she would tell me the way:' and as there may be
others who would like at the same time to better their
property and their health, to plant roses round their
habitation and in their cheeks, I cannot do better than
give good Mrs Grimshawe's account of matters as she
gave them to me:-
“A very little building and mason - work done under
my own eyes-for I overlooked everything myself a
diligent use of the needle, in which both I and my maid
were indefatigable, together with regular ready-money
payments, were the only "slaves of the lamp" which
were needed to transform the dirty, dingy little house
you remember into what you now see it; unless,
indeed, I add a foreseeing mind, which planned and
calculated beforehand both as to fitness and cost, so as
to leave no deliberative measures to be entered on
when workmen were waiting for directions, and activity
ought to be the order of the day. But as it is my
garden which forms the subject of your inquiry, I will
say nothing about the house, though I could tell you
wonders about that too.
You must know then that, like Abraham Cowley,
"I never had any other desire so strong and so like to
covetousness, as that one which I have always had
that I might be master at last of a small house and
large garden, with very moderate conveniences joined
to them, and then dedicate the remainder of my life
only to the culture of them and study of nature.” I
must modify the expression a little, and say, instead of
"a large garden," "a small garden;" and add, " and of
the God of nature," and then you have the amount of my
aspirations. I was put aside from attaining any part of
this for many years; but as I had often boasted how
pretty my garden should be when I had one, I could
not be content to fall short of my boasting; and when
it pleased God to put opportunity in my way, I felt
myself stirred up, as much perhaps by the desire to be
as good as my word, as by that of having a really
enjoyable garden. I have also a sort of natural love of
overcoming difficulties, so that those which now stood
in my way rather stimulated than discouraged me.
But how to set to work. I had never yet made a
garden, and knew little about it: the situation, so near
the road and so much in the shade, was not quite what
I could, have wished. There was neither grass nor
flowers, neither gravel-walk nor parterre, neither mould
nor manure. I had no servant but one maid and a
little girl, very little strength, and but L.5 to lay out;
for on summing up my finances and my responsibilities,
I found that this sum was the utmost I could with
propriety bestow on a mere luxury. However, "Faint
heart never won fair lady." I must have my garden--I
must make good my boast; and so I set about it with a
good heart. You know our friend Cowper says:
"He, therefore, who would see his flowers dispos'd
Sightly and in just order, ere he gives
The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds,
Forecasts the future whole; that when the scene
Shall break into its preconceiv'd display,
Each for itself, and all as with one voice
Conspiring may attest his bright design."
'Hours after hours, therefore, with this design in
view, I stood at my windows planning: the naked walls
eight feet high became, as I gazed, clothed with
draperies of climbing-plants of every hue; the mud-
heaps turned into prettily-shaped flower-beds, and the
waste of liquid mud which surrounded them into
verdant turf; a fine, firm gravel-walk rose into exist-
ence, and a visionary tree, just of sufficient size to allow
of my sitting under its shadow, loomed into sight;
whilst here and there little hillocks of turf, crowned
with flowering shrubs, broke the monotony of the flat:
in fact, I saw things more as they are now than as
they really were at that time; and after sundry musings,
I took pen and ink and marked out a sort of ground-
plan of my future garden, from which I have scarcely
deviated. I then set warily to work. My first step
was to get my walk made, not gravelled-that I left for
a finishing stroke; but a path to my house must be
secured at once. This, then, was marked out. One
labourer for I could not afford gardeners-was set to
break up the ground, whilst another levelled the space
designed for the turf and flower beds; a child being
employed to clear away the stones and sticks which
were turned up by the diggers; and here came in a
stroke of good-luck. On picking up the ground the
men came on a layer of a sort of marl, which was
pronounced to be the very thing for walk-making: this,
therefore, was collected and laid on the substratum of
fagot-wood which had been placed; and in a day or two
I saw a good, firm, five-foot wide path, well rounded off
at the sides, so as that no water should be allowed to
settle on it, connecting both the doors of my house
with the outer world. This being done, and the ground
being levelled, my maid and I pegged out the flower-
beds; and the deads, as they call the hard waste
earth which was dug out from them, and from the
foundations of my bit of building, were thrown up in
certain places where I had an eye to a bank or mound,
and this at the same time saved me the expense of
carting away the rubbish, and secured to me the little
undulations I had planned.
This done, and the stones being gathered to one
place for other purposes, I set about the most
expensive part of my operation—namely, turfing. I
had to get turf for this from the hillside, and to
pay so much a load for it, besides the expense of
cutting and carrying, and I really began to fear that
my L.5 would never hold out; however, by sparing
both men to cut and prepare the turf, and at the same
time to select a few rough stones for my bit of rock-
work on which I had set my mind, and then, when all
was ready, hiring a cart and horse for the day, I con-
trived to get the matter accomplished.
I could of
course have sown grass-seed, and this would have been
less expense at first; but by the time I had had it
properly weeded and rolled, and cut sufficiently often
to make it fine, it would have cost but little less than
bringing the turf from the hill, and not have been
in order nearly so soon; therefore, as the turf was

to be had not very far off, I indulged myself in this
one matter in taking the more expensive course, and I
have not regretted it. I believe I saved a great deal
both of time and money by knowing my own mind,
and having all my plans cut and dried, and ready for
use before I set to work. You should have seen how
the men stared at the decision and rapidity with which
all went on! There was no shilly-shallying; but one
thing succeeded another with such promptness and
regularity as could not have been but for my long
window-gazings and my many calculations. I daresay
I made a dozen mistakes, but there was no one to find
them out, and I succeeded finely on the whole, and
my L.5 paid for all, and left me a few shillings to
buy plants for my new garden.
Then there were some evergreens which were in the
ground when I bought it-more than I needed; so I got
the nurseryman to change them for about fifteen shil-
lings' worth of shrubs and climbers for my walls; and by
the middle of November my mounds, flower-beds, and
rockery were all complete, and the turf and gravel laid. |
It all looked rather trampled and muddy, and the flower-
beds bare enough, notwithstanding several baskets of
plants sent me by old friends at my former home; but it
was all in order to grow, and I rested from my labours
with pleased anticipations of the beauty that was to
follow. I put some ranunculus roots in one bed, and
some nemophila in another (that, you know, if sown late
in the year blows early in the spring), and I thought
my work was done, but, alas! I had not been quite so
clever as I had supposed. I had forgotten that when
rain came it must necessarily pond in the lowest part
of my ground, and I had not provided any means to
prevent this; so to my dismay I saw, when I rose one
morning, that a regular flood had taken up its quarters
in my garden, and there were only the highest parts of
the flower-beds in sight, looking like little boats float-
ing about in the turbid waters. Now came in my heap
of stones. I was obliged to have the turf carefully
raised, and to intersect my ground with a series of
ditches about two and a half feet deep. These were
half-filled with stones loosely put in, so as to leave
passage for the water between, and then filled up with
earth, and the turf laid over all: these acted as land-
drains; and proud I was to see that at last my turf
was visible even in a stormy day.'
'But, ray dear madam,' said I, 'I cannot even now
make out how you have contrived that your parterres
should look so gay, and those acres of wall be so
speedily concealed.'
Annuals, my dear-mere annuals,' replied my friend:
'by winter they will be as bare as ever. I put in
stores of canariensis, sweet peas, nasturtiums, major
convolvuluses, &c. and very pretty they look just as a
temporary covering; but I am not trusting wholly to
them: there are other creepers of a more permanent
character planted between-such as varieties of roses
and clematis, a westaria, and a passion-flower, and these
will next year begin to make some appearance; but it
will be three or four years before I shall be able to
make any show without my annuals. Of course the
same management is in a degree necessary in my
flower-beds, as whilst my roses, fuchsias, and carna-
tions are maturing, mignonette, convolvulus, and
other bright annuals, fill up nicely. The great diffi-
culty is to provide that your garden shall not be bril-
lient in one month, and dull all the rest of the year.
This must be managed by a wise admixture of those
plants which bloom at different seasons, so that
when one goes off another near it shall be just
beginning its blossoms, and also by having some
odd corner where you can store away a few plants
which will bear removing so as to fill up the vacant
spaces left by decayed annuals, &c. Now all this
is easy enough where you have a regular gardener
and a greenhouse, or where you can afford to go to a
|
salesman and purchase plants in blossom suited to the
season as it comes; but for those who have neither of
these helps I can only recommend the plans I have
suggested, and also to stick into the earth every bit
they are obliged to cut off from such plants as will
grow by cuttings, or that they break off by accident.
It is quite a mistake to fancy that all cuttings require
warmth and shelter. It is not so; for most kinds of
fuchsias, carnations, salvias, and even geraniums, will
grow in the open ground, if put in early in the year;
and as to pentstemons, you may get a dozen plants to
grow where one will fail.'
'You have succeeded most wonderfully, dear madam,'
said I; but there is one point on which you have not
touched, which moves my astonishment more than any
others, and that is the extraordinary improvement in
your own appearance.'
'All traceable to the garden, my dear Miss Oliphant,'
was the reply. First in superintending the making of
my garden, and then in watching over my plants, I
have been of necessity continually out of doors; and I
believe nothing is more beneficial to health than a
pleasant out-of-door employment, which interests the
mind without overstretching it. You know I cannot
bear much walking or standing, so I generally have a
chair at hand, and sit whilst I direct my subordinates;
and not unfrequently I sit on a low camp-stool whilst I
trim a rose-bush or pink-root, or even sow a patch of
seeds or pull up some weeds. I and my maid-for I have
indoctrinated her deeply in the art of gardening-are
always at it, and are busy together every evening train-
ing and trimming, and certainly the benefit to the health
of both has been great. I am glad to hear that you too
have a garden to make, for you look but a poor delicate
creature. Ah, my dear, take my word for it,' continued
the good lady, neither the gay balls and opera, nor the
intellectual conversazioni and soirées, in which you
have been so much of late during your travels, are half
so good for body or mind as the more simple pursuits
of gardening and other such country pleasures.
satisfied that when you have once set well to work in
making your garden, we shall soon see the carnation-
hue on your cheek once more.'
I am
And so we parted, for my visit had been overlong.
It is now, I think, the fourth year of good Mrs Grim-
shawe's occupancy of the once dreary cottage, and a
few days ago I spent an hour or two in the pretty
garden which it has become one of my pleasures to
watch. No material alterations have been made since
its first formation, only some of the flower-beds enlarged
or altered a little in form, and one or two new ones
cut; but the growth of the shrubs and creepers has
greatly altered its appearance, and the elegant neatness
of all about it combines with the exquisite brilliancy of
colouring, and the rich odours arising from sweetbrier,
clematis, heliotrope, carnations, and a thousand other
fragrant blossoms, to render Mrs Grimshawe's garden a
perfect paradise of dainty devices.' I inquired how
she managed to have her walls so closely and neatly
covered, for I could perceive none of those ugly nails
and pieces of list and cloth which deface so much the
beauty of such arrangements in general.
•
See here, my good friend,' said she, putting aside
some of the leaves which concealed it, and shewing me
a wire round which the stems and tendrils of several
plants were intertwined: 'look at this phalanx of wire.
One of the first things I did was to provide means for
my creepers to ascend without my having the endless
expense and trouble of getting them nailed. I procured
a quantity of large nails and some common iron wire,
and set one of my handy labouring friends to work. İ
made him drive one row of nails at the top at about
twelve inches apart, and another to correspond at the
bottom of each wall, and then strain a wire from each
of those above to each of those below, which wire he
afterwards painted dark-green, to preserve it from

rusting, as well as for neatness of appearance: this I
had done on all the walls; and at a cost of less than
10s., including nails, wire, labour, and paint, I got
what, had I gone to the ironmonger and had the usual
rods and wire, would have cost me about as many
pounds; and as not one has as yet failed, I conclude
the one plan is as good as the other. Now you see I
have only to catch the end of any shoot which is
getting wild, and tuck it behind the wire, and it soon
takes hold, and fixes itself by means of some one or
other of those wonderful provisions which God has made
for the purpose of enabling plants that run high to
support themselves. Now do, my dear, just look at the
beautiful holdfast provided for this Virginian creeper!
You see it needs no wire, but by means of this sort of
claw it fixes itself to the bare wall, and draws itself
up to any height. Ah, you may pull, but you will not
loosen it,' added she, seeing me trying to get one of the
articles under discussion to examine: the little red
stem will break, but no force will loosen the beautiful
sucker-like points from their hold. But there,' con-
tinued my friend, I must not begin on my favourite
subject. If I ever do write anything for the public, I
really think it must be a treatise on holdfasts-I mean
the tendrils and twisting stems, and other such provi-
sions for climbing-plants.'
6
'I am sure I for one shall feel great interest in
reading it, dear madam,' said I; but it grows late, and
I must go.' And so, leaving the good lady absorbed so
completely in contemplating her claw' that she could
scarcely say farewell, I departed, laden, however, with
such a gorgeous bunch of flowers as few other little
gardens could have furnished without being divested
of half their sweets.
THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON.
November 1851.
SINCE my last there has been no lack of something to
talk about, so various were and still are the current
topics. For one-the closing of the Exhibition, which,
following hard upon the excitement of a week that
brought visitors in hundreds of thousands daily, greater
numbers than ever before-left a keener sense of
regret on the minds of those who heard the Hallelujah
Chorus sound the grand finale, and who witnessed the
concluding act. Simultaneously with the clearing out
of the vast collection has come the conferring of decora-
tions and titles on some of the more active members of
the executive, made more acceptable in some instances
by the substantial 'fee' which accompanies the un-
substantial distinction-rewards which few will care
to quarrel with. What shall be done with the surplus?
and what with the building? still remain questions for
grave consideration and satisfactory conclusion. Some
of the statistics-now become historical-connected
with the extraordinary undertaking make their appear-
ance from time to time: among others it appears, with
regard to the refreshments supplied, the quantity of
meat consumed, including hams, tongues, German
sausages, &c., and in savoury pies, was more than
140,000 lbs.; of mustard, 1120 lbs.; of sponge- cakes,
73,280; Bath - buns, 622,960; plain buns, 409,360;
milk and cream, nearly 35,000 quarts, of which the
greater portion was cream; coffee, 5118 lbs.; tea,
1015 lbs.; of lemonade, soda-water, and ginger-beer,
555,720 bottles; of ice, 409,920 lbs.; and of salt, 47,040
lbs. What a marvellous list! and this is but a part of
it. Take down Napoleon's campaign in Russia from
your shelf, and contrast it with the catalogue of his
preparations.
Foremost among the results predicated of the
Exhibition is a Museum of Economic Botany, to be
established in the gardens at Kew, which we may hope
will become no unworthy pendant to the Museum of
Economic Geology in Jermyn Street. And farther,
the Americans talk of getting up an Exhibition on
their own account at New York, to be opened in April
next; and as an inducement to those who may have
anything to exhibit, they advertise themselves as
willing to convey the goods free of all charges to the
other side of the Atlantic in first-class vessels. If
Brother Jonathan be really in earnest in this matter,
I for one wish him full success.
Another result of the closing is, that our vehicular
providers, not finding passengers so plentiful as during
the time that the great spectacle was open, have
resolved on a reduction of fares, so as, if possible, to
keep their whole number of omnibuses in work, rather
than to lay them up in ordinary. Already several
routes are served at the diminished charge, and the cry
of 'penny 'bus' may be heard where competition is
active. You can now ride from one end of Oxford
Street to the other for a penny, and at low charges
from one railway-station to another: and if enterprise
be energetic, we shall perhaps at last get to a properly-
priced and convenient system of locomotion. London
is too often apt to imagine that it has nothing to learn,
yet it might pick up a useful hint now and then from
other quarters-if it would. Liverpool, for instance,
could have told some time ago a secret worth knowing
about penny 'buses; and Paris has long shewn that it
is possible to have a uniform threepenny fare for the
longest distances, even if it involved a change of
vehicle. The French omnibuses, too, are larger than
ours; you are not required to stoop so low on entering;
while a brass-rod fixed beneath the centre of the roof
affords a hold, and enables you to make your way along
the vehicle without falling over the knees of the other
passengers. However, the capital of the civilised
world,' as it fondly calls itself, is feeling its way
towards a better state of things-the New Cab Com-
pany, namely, which proposes to run cabs in all parts
of London at fourpence a mile, and, what is more, with
civil and honest. When this reform takes place, it
drivers who are to wear a uniform, and be uniformly
will be almost worth your while to come to town and
make trial of its benefits.
•
The arrival of Kossuth, too, is talked of everywhere:
he has already made one public visit to the City, and
is soon to repeat it. Had you been in the Strand a few
days since, you would have seen the Hungarian tricolor
green, red, and white-displayed at several windows,
and the whole length of the streets lined with people
anxious to get a sight of the famous Magyar. Not
least remarkable on such an occasion are the effects
produced on the usual street-traffic by such an occur-
rence: certain phenomena are then created not to be
seen at other times. Talking of visits to the City
reminds me that an attempt is to be made to relieve
our circumambient atmosphere of the soot which now
darkens it, to the annoyance of natives and horror of
foreigners; for the Commissioners of Sewers of the
City (mark, the City only!) of London, making use of
their powers, have ordered that from and after the 1st
day of January next, all the chimneys of any furnace
in any building used for the purposes of trade or
manufacture within the City, shall in all cases be con-
structed or altered so as to consume the smoke arising
from such furnace.' At the same time they declare
that any person using a furnace after the day specified,
so that the smoke arising therefrom shall not be effec-
tually consumed or burnt, or shall carry on any trade
or business which shall occasion any noxious or offen-
sive effluvia, or otherwise annoy the neighbourhood or
inhabitants, without using, to the satisfaction of the
commissioners, the best practicable means for prevent-
ing or counteracting such annoyance, every person so

offending shall forfeit and pay a sum of not more than
five pounds nor less than forty shillings for and in respect
of every day during which, or any part of which, such
furnace or annoyance shall be so used or continued.'
At the risk of being tedious, I have preferred to give
you the very words of the document, which has been
extensively circulated, as the subject is one of great
importance, not only to Londoners but to the inha-
bitants of every large town in the kingdom. We have
been so many years in achieving this measure towards
smoke-suppression, that we must now hope there will
be no lack of vigour in enforcing its provisions.
You must now give me leave to add a few words to the
account of the arctic expeditions in my last. I there told
you that Captain Penny and Sir John Ross had come
home; but, to the surprise of every one, and to the vexa-
tion of the Admiralty functionaries, they were followed
few days later by Captain Austin, with the four vessels
under his command. It appears that, in pursuance of
his intention, he went to Jones's Sound-sailed up it
some forty-five miles, and not finding what he was in
search of, tacked about, and returned to England. We
shall shortly hear what has been resolved on by the
several arctic councils' that have sat at the Admiralty:
one fact, however, is already public-namely, that
another expedition will be sent out next spring to
complete the work which Austin left unfinished.
Meantime, Lady Franklin's little vessel, the Prince
Albert, is doubtless frozen up in winter-quarters, and
news have been received by way of the United States,
that the ice having been found impassable, Captain
Collinson's ships are on their way back to England.
Let me add also, that Cape Riley forms one extremity
of a cove, of which Beechey Island forms the other: it
was between the two, but nearest to the latter, that
Franklin wintered. They lie just at the mouth of
Wellington Channel, up which the American ships
were drifted as far as 76 degrees north, before they
were caught in the resistless drift which carried them
down again, and away to Baffin's Bay. These vessels
have returned to New York, and thus we are as far as
ever from knowing what has become of Sir John
Franklin and his companions.
Literature-that is, publishing-lias not been very
active of late; the most notable book that has made
its appearance being Carlyle's Life of John Sterling.'
Signs of coming activity are, however, apparent, as is
usual when November's turn comes upon the calendar:
Mr Grote is shortly to give us two more volumes of his
'Greece;' Dickens announces another of his stories, in
twenty numbers; Sir Francis Head promises some-
thing entitled 'All my Eye;' Worsaae, the celebrated
Danish antiquary, is to inform us concerning our Saxon
and Scandinavian ancestors in a book soon to make its
appearance. It would be easy to lengthen the list;
but not having space, I may tell you that Macaulay
has not forgotten that his History of England' is not
finished; that Mrs Browning is sojourning with her
poet-husband for a brief season at Paris; and that the
laureate, instead of passing the winter in Italy, has
come home-to work.
•
passed before our eyes almost unnoticed, and as matters
of course.
It is a sudden jump to talk about Trinity-House
matters, but you must bear with it, as this is the last of
my home-items." It seems that notwithstanding the
improvements made in lighthouses of late years, they
are still defective in many essential particulars, which
are, according to Mr Wells of the Admiralty-their
being too high, and consequently appearing more dis-
tant than they really are; and the too great resem-
blance among the various lights, the deceptive optical
effects produced by coloured glasses, and the general
want of intensity in the light commonly exhibited. He
proposes a remedy which, besides setting naval men
a-talking as to its merits, combines, it is said, security
with economy-namely, 'the cutting of four or more
circular apertures in all the present structures, just
below the lantern, and fitting the openings with glazed
sashes of ground plate-glass, painted so as to leave the
initial of the particular lighthouse bold and distinct.
The length of the letter being three times the size
of the light of the lantern, would be more clearly
visible, and leave no doubt as to what the lighthouse is,
and where situate.
"This alteration is suggested for the existing light-
houses; but where it might be necessary to construct
new ones, it would be better they should not be carried
to the present altitude, as the nearer the light is to the
level of the eye, the less probability would exist as to
any mistake in the distance of it.'
In these days of education and scientific research,
it is surprising to hear that the members of the
Royal Institute of the Netherlands at Amsterdam
have begged the government to disincorporate them, on
the ground that the sum annually voted for them is
insufficient to enable them to carry out their own
statutes, and to flourish as an institute ought. It
would be unfortunate were this body to be broken up,
as it is one that has done good work in the cause
of science and philosophy, and borne many eminent
names on its roll. In a country so wealthy as Holland,
it is remarkable to find a scientific institution unable
to exist without assistance from the public funds: is
it that the spirit of trade is too omnipotent? Qur
Royal Society has long prospered, and still prospers
without government aid. Therein perhaps consists its
vitality.
You would hardly expect to find academical life more
vigorous in Turkey than in the Netherlands, yet such
is the fact. The mother of the present sultan has
caused an Academy of Sciences' to be built not far
from the mausoleum which contains the body of her
late husband; and at its opening a short time since, in
presence of nearly the whole of the court, the grand
vizier made a speech appropriate to the occasion. With
recollections of the Arabian Nights' in one's mind, it
is with mingled surprise and incredulity that one hears
of a vizier doing anything of the sort. Here, however,
is a report of the speech which, under the circum-
stances, is perhaps worth preserving:His Highness
the Sultan, our august sovereign and benefactor, on
The Report just published by the Registrar-General the day of his accession to the throne of his ancestors,

Academy of Sciences, erected under the patronage of
his illustrious mother. We are happy, indeed, to live in
so prosperous a century, and to be able thus to enjoy
so many advantages of education not known to our
forefathers. Our children also will be even greater
participators than ourselves in the bounteous patronage
of our common benefactor and sovereign. May the
days of His Highness long be spared to his country!'
Who can tell?-perhaps by a diligent following of this
new track the Turks may falsify their foreboding of
being some day expelled from Europe.
Certain matters which have transpired beyond the
Atlantic have added somewhat to our talk. The
American Association for the Advancement of Science,
which met at Albany last August, have just published
a summary of their proceedings. Agassiz was presi-
dent, and more than 120 papers on different subjects
were presented to the meeting. Among them was one
of importance to astronomers-'A new lunar formula,
by Mr Longstreth, containing a correction, according
to which an error hitherto disregarded is eliminated,
and a perfect coincidence with observation is obtained.'
Another was 'On the clouds and equatorial cloud-rings
of the earth; and another, On the influence of terres-
trial electricity on climates.' There was a large
sprinkling of physiological, ethnological, geological,
and chemical subjects: one by Agassiz on alternate
generation among the medusa; Additional facts
respecting the experiments by which a person can see
the arteries of his own eyes;On the separation of
butter from cream by catalysis. Professor Peirce is
to be president for next year, and the meeting will be
held at Cleveland, Ohio, in August 1852. It appears to
be the custom for the city that invites the Association
to meet within its walls, to entertain the members, and
also to pay for the publication of their proceedings.
This is playing the host handsomely.
Dr Kirtland of Cleveland states that last winter, as
the frost set in, a number of eels in a mill- pool,
incommoded by the subsidence of the ice, effected their
escape into some adjoining ponds, from which, by
breaking through the ice, he obtained about eight or
ten bushels in a half-frozen state. During the night
they were placed in a cold and exposed room, and were
literally as stiff, and almost as brittle as icicles, The
next morning a tub was filled with them, into which
was poured a quantity of water drawn from the well,
and they were then placed in a warm stove-room for
the purpose of thawing. In the course of an hour or
two the family were astonished to find them resusci-
tated, and as active as if just taken during the summer.
The experiment was repeated with a number of tubfuls
during the day, and with similar results. The effects
of frost on animal life is a subject to which at the
present time naturalists at home and abroad are
paying much attention; and they may add this to
their store of facts and data.
-
The Smithsonian Institution, at Washington, are
about to extend and continue the valuable series of
researches begun by Quetelet in Belgium, by collecting
information with regard to the periodical phenomena
of animal and vegetable life in North America.'
Parties willing to co-operate are given to understand
that the subjects most to be noticed are the first
appearance of leaves and of flowers in plants; the
dates of appearance and disappearance of migratory or
hybernating animals as mammalia, birds, reptiles,
fishes, insects, &c.; the times of nesting of birds, of
moulting, and littering of mammalia, of utterance of
characteristic cries among reptiles and insects. They
ask also for lists of the animals and plants from all
parts of the North-American continent, with a view to
construct a series of tables shewing the geographical
distribution of the animal and vegetable kingdom in
North America;' and they publish a list of plants,
many of which are natives of Europe or grow there:
we shall thus obtain valuable means for comparison.
The Smithsonian Institution are wisely and worthily
employing the noble bequest of their founder.
BLIND WALTER.
A TALE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
You are all doubtless aware that Greenwich may be
reached both by railway and steamer; and if you were
there a few years ago you might have remarked, near
the steamboat pier, the hero of this narrative. He
was then a pale, slight youth of sixteen, good-looking,
but with that peculiar expression of countenance—
half-resignation, half-anxiety-which belongs to the
blind. He was quite blind-stone-blind, and had been
so from his birth. He had for about two years played
the fiddle daily at the corner of a certain street. Every
morning he was brought to his post by an old woman
with whom he lodged, or sometimes by a little girl, her
grandchild, who also brought his dinner at one o'clock,
and fetched him home to tea at six. He never asked
for money; but at his feet lay a small basket, into
which halfpence poured pretty freely. There was a
quiet, uncomplaining manner about him; he was so
neat and clean, that in the neighbourhood he was a
favourite, and all strangers admired him. But what
was curious and pleasant to see was the respect shewn
him by all sailors, watermen, and old college-men.
Though he could not see, they always touched their
hats to him, and said 'Sir' when they wished him good-
morning or good-evening. But then Blind Walter was
the son of a captain in the royal navy, who had left
him without a father at six years old. He had had a
mother, but she was what is rarely found in this world,
as I daresay you all know-a bad mother; and that is
the worst thing that can fall to the lot of a child. She
was not what the world calls wicked, but she was so
really. She neglected her blind boy; she let him pick
up his education how he could; and but for the kind-
ness of an old musician, who took a fancy to him, and
when his mother was out fetched him to his house,
he would have known nothing.
The musician was a poor old Italian, a gentleman in
habits and feelings; and he taught the boy to speak
Italian, to be tidy and clean, and to play the violin.
Walter became passionately fond of music, which, when
his mother made the discovery, rather warmed her
feelings towards her child. She had him more neatly
dressed than before, and took him wherever she went
as a prodigy. Walter, who was an intelligent and
pleasing lad, was universally liked. He was petted
and taken notice of, and soon acquired the manners of
the society to which he was now introduced. The im-
portance of early training and education, which perhaps
just now may not be exactly pleasing to some of you,
was demonstrated in the case of Blind Walter. When
he fell into other circumstances he never lost his grace-
ful manners, his soft tone of voice-the surest marks of
good-breeding and good company; and he gained largely
by it. But his fall was sudden and unexpected. His
mother, the portionless daughter of poor, proud people
of good family, whom Walter's father had married
for her beauty, died deeply in debt; and the poor boy
found himself alone in the world with nothing but
his violin, saved from the creditors with much difficulty.
They had been two years in Greenwich when this hap-
pened; and the father having been much liked by his
crew-some of whom were now in Greenwich Hospital
these old pensioners held council. They would have
liked to send the boy, now their child, to sea, but
his blindness was a serious drawback: they then

advised him to try his fortune with the violin, and
Walter, who had no other friends-his father having been
an orphan, protected by one now dead-followed their
kind advice. His first day's trial was wondrous in its
result: all the college-men came by quietly without
saying a word, and threw in their halfpence; and
Walter Arnott thanked God in his heart, while he
thought gratefully of the poor Italian musician, some
time dead, who had been the instrument of Providence
in giving him the means of earning his livelihood. He
took a neat, clean, but cheap room in the house of an
aged widow, with an orphan grandchild, a girl of
thirteen years old; and after paying his way, giving
little presents to Alice, and keeping himself in decent
clothes and clean linen, put the rest by in the Savings'
Bank in the name of a clerk in the Hospital, who
regularly gave him twopence every week out of affec-
tion to the memory of his father. Scarcely any of
those who had been friends of Mrs Arnott's ever
noticed Walter, except to give him a sixpence, in a
patronising way; but Walter wanted not their aid.
He was independent-he was happy.
IIe seldom went out in the evening. He would get
Alice to read to him books which a friend purchased
for him-chiefly naval histories and tales, and lives
of celebrated musicians and emperors. He did not,
however, forget what was useful to her, and their
education went on together with wonderful success.
Alice was soon passionately fond of reading; and as no
occupation is at the same time so pleasing and useful,
if you avoid bad books-the worst poison on earth
their evenings were delightful. Neither did Walter
neglect his Italian; he pronounced and spoke it
well. He bought a grammar, dictionary, and some
Italian books, and by dint of perseverance soon trained
Alice to study with him. The old grandmother left
them to their own course: she already looked on Walter
as the future husband of her child, though he solemnly
and firmly declared that he would never be a burden
to any woman, if one could be found generous enough
to marry the blind fiddler.
About two years had passed, and Walter was
between eighteen and nineteen, while Alice was a
pretty girl of fifteen. The blind youth had learned to
read and to write. He had made remarkable progress
too in music, and began to be asked to go to balls, and
even concerts. He had a beautiful collection of violins,
once the idols of the poor Italian, and this was greatly
in his favour. One afternoon he was playing some
exquisite piece of Italian music to a silent crowd, when
a youth about his own age, in the dress of a midship-
man, pushed forward, and stood with a blank and
astonished air gazing at him. Presently Walter
finished; and the crowd, after showering halfpence upon
him, moved away. But the midshipman remained.
'Walter Arnott!' exclaimed he in tones of deep
astonishment.
'Ah, Frank Prescott,' cried the blind youth with
genuine satisfaction.
Is that you? How kind to
notice me now!'
What! the son of the former
Good Heaven, this is shameful-
'Notice you now!
captain of our ship!
this is dreadful!'
'Not at all: I am very happy-I could not be more
so,' replied Walter gently.
Nonsense; you could and shall. Just put your
fiddle under your arm, and come and dine with me at
the "Greyhound." No denial. I must tell you my
story, and you must tell me yours. I wanted a friend
in Greenwich: I've found one.'
Walter could not resist such hearty kindness; and
after bargaining that they should call at his home, that
he might leave his fiddle, and have thus an excuse for
explaining his departure from his post, they walked arm-
in-arm up the town. A hearty greeting did the middy
get from every sailor and invalid he met. Every one was
pleased to see the blind fiddler taken notice of, and Alice
was quite proud when, handing her his violin, Walter
told where he was going. The middy ordered a very
good dinner, after which he informed the young musician
that he had an uncle in Greenwich whose daughter he
was very much in love with; that being poor, with
very small prospects, he concealed his affection from
his uncle, who wished his cousin Gertrude to marry
some one her equal in point of fortune. To Gertrude
he had not spoken distinctly-he was too young for
that; but he was sure she responded to his affection.
He was now, however, about to leave England on a
three years' cruise, and he was in a state of great
uneasiness of mind. He knew not what might happen
in the interval. He could not write to the young
lady, as he knew she would decline carrying on a clan-
destine correspondence-and he loved her the more
for her delicacy. But still he wanted some friend
to give him news of her, and her news of him. Blind
Walter readily volunteered to do this by the hand of
Alice, if he could at any time pick up intelligence
of interest. But Frank Prescott had a better plan
than that- he would get his uncle and cousin to
patronise him: next evening there was to be a quiet
dance, and he must come and play. And Walter did
so, and the evening was twice as pleasant as it otherwise
would have been. The blind musician entered into the
spirit of the affair; played as long and as often as they
liked; was a general favourite with the ladies, espe-
cially with Gertrude Prescott; and pleased everybody
so much with his playing, that he henceforth found his
engagements multiply.
From that day he abandoned his station in the
street he played at evening-parties, he gave lessons,
and all without neglecting his education or that of
Alice. During the stay of Frank Prescott the young
people were inseparable; the midshipman was delighted
with his old acquaintance, and they parted attached
friends.
Blind Walter actually loved Frank, for with him
kindness was irresistible. There are natures which
cannot resist the influence of affection, who will love a
person who gives them a flower, a word, a look; and
Walter was one of those. When Frank was gone, he
transferred his affection to Frank's future wife, without
forgetting his dear Alice. Miss Prescott came often to
see them; and when she found that the young girl was
a good Italian scholar, asked her home, and took lessons
of her. Proud indeed now was Alice of her having
studied and read, for Walter was pleased, and she
found a sincere friend in Gertrude.
Things went on in this way for nearly two years,
when Gertrude reached the age of twenty. Suitors
now came round in earnest, and Mr Prescott desired
Gertrude to choose among the several competitors.
But she could not make up her mind, she said-not
daring to avow her affection for Frank. But her father
insisted, and himself selected a Mr Charles Williams, a
rising young barrister with brilliant prospects. One
evening Gertrude was very unhappy: Alice was by
her side, and Blind Walter was hourly expected. Miss
Prescott was very dull and low-spirited, and nothing
her humble friend could do could rouse her.
'What is the matter?' asked Alice earnestly, after
vainly endeavouring to get on with her Italian lesson.
'Papa insists upon my receiving the addresses of
Mr Charles Williams. He is going to ask him to
dinner on Monday next. What am I to do?'
But, my dear Miss Prescott,' said Alice earnestly,
'why not avow your affection for your cousin
Frank?'
'Because my father long ago forbade me to think of
him. Frank has nothing but his profession, which is
not lucrative enough to please my dear papa.'
'I don't know what to advise. I wish Walter were
here; he would tell us.'

At this very instant the door opened, and the servant
announced in a loud voice: Sir Walter Arnott!'
They rose astounded, and in walked Blind Walter,
leaving at the door a servant in rich livery, who had led
him up. He was fashionably dressed, but his smile was
as gentle and sweet as ever. He advanced to a sofa,
took the hands of his two friends, and sat down between
them. His story was very brief. Seven lives which
had stood between his father and a baronetcy of
L.25,000 a year had all lapsed, save one, long ago;
and about six months previously the last survivor,
a descendant of his grandfather's eldest brother, had
died without issue and intestate. A week before that
evening the solicitor traced Blind Walter as the next
of kin. He had kept his secret until all was settled,
passing off the solicitor as a pupil; and this day he had
been put in possession of his property, the lord-chan-
cellor having appointed trustees for the three months
he wanted of being of age.
'But you seem in trouble,' said Sir Walter when
he had told his story-for he always observed the
slightest difference in the intonation of voice.
Alice, who was 'overwhelmed at what she had heard,
timidly explained.
'I see only one remedy,' observed the blind young
baronet after some reflection.
'And what is that?' asked Gertrude anxiously.
'You must let me court you for the next four
months. I have this day-for I am influential now
sent Frank his leave of absence for twelve months,
begging him to come home. It seems I am indispen-
sable in a certain county where ministers want to keep
their supporters in, and so they can refuse me nothing.'
'Good Sir Walter!' exclaimed Gertrude and Alice.
'Blind Walter still with you! But listen: until
Frank returns, I will keep off all suitors. Say nothing,
only let us always be together-us three, I mean,' said
the quick-eared young man as he caught the sound of
a little sigh from Alice; and your father will give me
six months at least to think of it. But, my dear
friends, listen to me. I must marry now. In whom
else, now that I have such heavy trusts and duties, can
I confide than a wife? Twenty-five thousand a year
wants somebody who can see to attend to it. Had I
remained poor, no woman should ever have had such a
burden imposed on her. There is but one girl in the
world who ever can be my wife. While I was poor,
I studiously concealed my feelings; but now, dear
Alice, my riches, my rank, are vain indeed if you refuse
to be mine when Frank returns.'
6
'I, Sir Walter!' cried the amazed girl, pale with a
feeling more like alarm than anything else-'a poor
girl like me! What will your rich friends say?'
'Alice, you have for five years been my devoted
sister; we have studied together, thought together,
learned together: let us now, if your heart can recon-
cile itself to a blind husband, love one another. I am
not fit to be alone; but if you will not be the poor
blind boy's guardian angel, I must trust myself to some
hired servant.'
'Walter Walter!' cried Alice, sobbing aloud, 'I
have always loved you dearly, and, had you remained
poor, had always meant to beg you to take me for your
wife-your guide; and you would; for when mother
dies I shall be alone: but now I dare not accept’-
'You have accepted!' exclaimed Gertrude, placing
their hands one in another; and as Alice could not
speak, the betrothal was over. After a few minutes'
silence they discussed their plans, and were in the
midst of them when Mr Prescott entered hurriedly.
'Sir Walter, I am proud to congratulate you. I
am highly honoured by your making your first call
here.'
'I have to apologise for taking the liberty of coming
so unceremoniously. Hours suited to the musician
become perhaps unsuitable now.'
'Sir Walter, pray consider my house your own,'
said Mr Prescott warmly, half from genuine pleasure at
the good-luck of one he liked, as all did, and half from
the reflection that L.25,000 a year, even with a blind
baronet, was perhaps a very splendid prospect for his
daughter.
From that day all suitors withdrew before the young
baronet. Everybody looked upon the affair as settled.
Miss Gertrude and he, with Alice for a companion,
drove out together, went to parties together; and what
other result could be expected? But not one word
did any of the two say which could be construed into
deceit. Mr Prescott allowed matters to take their
course, not even sounding Gertrude on the point he
had at heart.
One morning Sir Walter called formally upon Mr
Prescott, and demanded the honour of an interview.
That gentleman bowed his young friend into the draw-
ing-room, and his heart beating rather more quickly
than usual, he sat down after handing Walter to a
chair.
'What, my dear Sir Walter,' said Mr Prescott
blandly, can I do for you?'
6
'I come,' said Walter, with almost the only trace
of sarcasm on his face which ever appeared there
'I come to speak to you of your daughter, Miss
Gertrude.'
'Indeed!' exclaimed Mr Prescott, with a very harm-
less attempt at playing astonishment in his tone.
'You will be very much surprised, my dear sir,' said
blind Walter a little timidly, at what I am going to
say.'
'Perhaps not,' said papa knowingly; 'I fancy'
'You have fancied wrong, Mr Prescott,' said Walter
firmly, if you have supposed that I have courted your
daughter on her own account. Listen to me first, and
be angry if you will afterwards. I have courted for
another-for a young man who loves her, and whom
she loves-a lieutenant in the navy, on whom I settle,
the day he marries, the sum of twenty thousand
pounds, which I have raised by felling timber, which
was far too luxuriant on my estates.'
'But!' exclaimed Mr Prescott, quite mollified at the
words 'twenty thousand pounds,' and who was, besides,
a very good-hearted man at bottom- but who is the
gentleman?'
'Your nephew Frank,' said Walter, moving to the
door as readily as if he could see.
Mr Prescott burst into a laugh: he saw at once the
whole conspiracy; and when the next minute Frank
and Gertrude entered, and he tried to scold, it was of
no avail: he was obliged to laugh anew, and when
Frank went over every detail of the plot from begin-
ning to end, he laughed still more. A happy dinner-
party was there that day at Mr Prescott's table.
There were Frank and Sir Walter, and Gertrude and
Alice. Frank demurred a little at the generosity of
his friend, but Walter asked what his riches came for
but to make his friends happy; and the sailor was
obliged to yield, as Mr Prescott declared that his con-
sent was given only conditionally.
And they were all four married a month later.
Frank retired from the service at the request of Ger-
trude, and accompanied Sir Walter and Lady Arnott
on a tour into Italy, where the latter wished to improve
their knowledge of the language, while Sir Walter felt
genuine joy on visiting the land of the poor musician,
to whom he owed everything. Frank, on their return,
settled near the baronet's estates, and is still as devoted
a friend as man can wish for; and Alice, whose grand-
mother still lives in a beautiful cottage built for her
in the Park, is an ornament to the class to which she
has risen. Her mind, refined by education, study, and
thought, she is quite equal to her station; and oh!
what joy is hers now, when the oculists have declared
that in time Sir Walter may be brought to see.

AN UNFORTUNATE PIG.
THE CHILD'S TREASURE.
AROUND a throne of cloud and storm
A summer rainbow came;
No shadow veiled its perfect form,
Nor dimmed its arch of flame;
In glowing colours, rich and warm,
Shone out that brilliant frame.
Its shape reflected on the cloud
In double arch was seen;
And where each line of radiance bowed
Appeared the tints between ;
While rays of light a spectre-road
Formed on the meadow's green.
In all the glee of childhood's days
An infant watched the bow;
For he had heard, in fairy lays,
That who was first to go
Might find a treasure, where the rays
Fell on the earth below.
On such a quest, with eager haste,
The youthful pilgrim strayed;
Across the forest, wild and waste,
He urged his steps-nor stayed,
But every danger boldly faced-
To where the bright beams played.
With trembling limbs he journeyed on,
To reach the horizon's bound;
And little felt the wearied one,
So might his hopes be crowned:
But yet the shining bow had gone
Long ere the place he found.
In an amusing book lately translated and published,
concerning the wild-sports of a certain district in France,
called Le Morvan,' the following account of the life of
an unfortunate pig is given by the author:-'A curé,
exiled to a deserted part of our forests-and who, the
whole year, except on a few rare occasions, lived only on
fruit and vegetables-hit upon a most admirable expe-
dient for providing an animal repast to set before the
curés of the neighbourhood, when one or the other, two
or three times during the year, ventured into these
dreadful solitudes, with a view of assuring himself with
his own eyes that his unfortunate colleague had not yet
died of hunger. The curé in question possessed a pig,
his whole fortune: and you will see, gentle reader, the
manner in which he used it. Immediately the bell
announced a visitor, and that his cook had shewn his
clerical friend into the parlour, the master of the house,
drawing himself up majestically, said to his house-
keeper: "Brigitte, let there be a good dinner for myself
and my friend." Brigitte, although she knew there
were only stale crusts and dried peas in her larder,
seemed in no degree embarrassed by this order; she
summoned to her assistance "Toby, the Carrot," so
called because his hair was as red as that of a native of
West Galloway, and leaving the house together, they both
went in search of the pig. This, after a short skirmish,
was caught by Brigitte and her carroty assistant; and,
notwithstanding his cries, his grunts, his gestures of
despair, and supplication, the inhuman cook, seizing his
head, opened a large vein in his throat, and relieved him
of two pounds of blood; this, with the addition of garlic,
shallots, mint, wild thyme and parsley, was converted into
a most savoury and delicious black-pudding for the curé
and his friend, and being served to their reverences smoking
hot on the summit of a pyramid of yellow cabbage, figured
admirably as a small Vesuvius and a centre dish. The
surgical operation over, Brigitte, whose qualifications as a
sempstress were superior, darned up the hole in the neck
of the unfortunate animal, and he was then turned loose
until a fresh supply of black-puddings should be required
for a similar occasion. This wretched pig was never
happy how could he be so? Like Damocles of Syracuse,
he lived in a state of perpetual fever; terror seized him
directly he heard the curé's bell, and seeing in imagina-
tion the uplifted knife already about to glide into his
bosom, he invariably took to his heels before Brigitte was
half-way to the door to answer it. If, as usual, the
peal announced a diner-out, Brigitte and Gold-button
were soon on his track, calling him by the most tender
epithets, and promising that he should have something Grecian states. —
nice for his supper-skim-milk, &c.-but the pig with his
painful experience was not such a fool as to believe
them: hidden behind an old cask, some fagots, or lying
in a deep ditch, he remained silent as the grave, and
kept himself close as long as possible. Discovered, how the Volumes of CHAMBERS'S EDUCATIONAL COURSE.

With weariness his heart beat fast;
He sought the grassy bed-

In sleep among the dead!

WHAT TO DO IN THE MEANTIME?
Ir has been frequently remarked by a philosopher of
our acquaintance, whose only fault is impracticability,
that in life there is but one real difficulty: this is
simply-what to do in the meantime? The thesis
requires no demonstration. It comes home to the
experience of every man who hears it uttered. From
the chimney-pots to the cellars of society, great and
small, scholars and clowns, all classes of struggling
humanity are painfully alive to its truth.

sopher: 'hast thou not all eternity to rest in?' And
to work, according to Mill's 'Political Economy,' is to

problem of mechanicians.

on whose recognition by others their material prosperity
depends. It may be laid down as a general axiom
in such cases, that the worst thing a man can do is to
wait, and the best thing he can do is to work; that
is to say, that in nine cases out of ten, doing something
has a great advantage over doing nothing. Such an
assertion would appear a mere obvious truism, and
one requiring neither proof nor illustration, were it
not grievously palpable to the student of the great
book of life-the unwritten biographical dictionary of

in which he went out set sail one fine morning, leaving
our friend on shore to the society and care of the native
negro population. His black acquaintances for some
time treated him with marked civility; but as the

familiarity began to breed its usual progeny, and the
unhappy German found himself in a most painful
position. Hitherto he had not been treated with actual

We knew another case in point, also connected with
the late king of the French. M. de G was, on the
downfall of that monarch, in possession of a very
handsome pension for past services. The revolution
came, and his pension was suspended. His wife was a
woman of energy: she saw that the pension might be
recovered by making proper representations in the
right quarters; but she also saw that ruinous embar-
rassment and debt might accrue in the interim. Her
house was handsomely furnished-she had been brought
up in the lap of wealth and luxury. She did not
hesitate;
she turned her house into a lodging-house,
sank the pride of rank, attended to all the duties of
such a station, and-what was the result? When, at
the end of three years, M. de G- recovered his
pension, he owed nobody a farthing, and the arrears
sufficed to dower one of his daughters about to marry a
gentleman of large fortune, who had become acquainted
with her by lodging in their house. Mme de G's
fashionable friends thought her conduct very shocking.
But what might have become of the family in three
years of petitioning?
The misfortune of our next case was, not that he
abandoned the law, but that the law abandoned him.
He was a solicitor in a country town, where the people
were either so little inclined to litigation, or so happy
in not finding cause for it, that he failed from sheer
want of clients, and, as a natural consequence, betook
himself to the metropolis-that Mecca cum Medina of
all desperate pilgrims in search of fickle Fortune.
There his only available friend was a pastrycook in a
large way of business. It so happened that the man of
tarts and jellies was precisely at that epoch in want of

subsequently to offend the irascible old gentleman so
utterly, that the latter suddenly withdrew his allowance
of L.1000 per annum, and left our friend to shift for
himself. His own means, never very great, were
entirely exhausted. He knew too well the impracticable
temper of his father-in-law to waste time in attempting
to soften him. He also knew that by his wife's settle-independent career. Our ex-lawyer, feeling the con-
ment he should be rich at the death of the old man,
who had already passed his seventieth year. He could
not borrow money, for he had been severely wounded
in Syria, and the insurance-offices refused him: but
he felt a spring of life and youth within him that
mocked their calculations. He took things cheerfully,
and resolved to work for his living. He answered
unnumbered advertisements, and made incessant appli-
cations for all sorts of situations. At length matters
came to a crisis: his money was nearly gone: time
pressed his wife and child must be supported. A
seat-not in parliament, but on the box of an omnibus
was offered him. He accepted it. The pay was
equivalent to three guineas a week. It was hard work,
but he stuck to it manfully. Not unfrequently it was
his lot to drive gentlemen who had dined at his table
and drunk his wine in former days. He never blushed
sumption of tarts to be more immediately certain than
the demand for writs, proposed, to his friend's amaze-
ment, for the vacant post; and so well did he fill it,
that in a few years he had saved enough of money to
start again in his old profession. The pastry cook and
his friends became clients, and he is at present a
thriving attorney in Lincoln's Inn, none the worse a
lawyer for a practical knowledge of the pâtés filled by
those oysters whose shells are the proverbial heritage
of his patrons.
A still more singular resource was that of a young
gentleman, of no particular profession, who having
disposed somehow or other in unprofitable speculations
of a very moderate inheritance, found himself what
is technically termed on his beam-ends;' so much so,
indeed, that his condition gradually came to verge on
positive destitution; and he sat disconsolately in a

little garret one morning, quite at his wits' end for the
means of contriving what Goethe facetiously called
'the delightful habit of existing.' Turning over his
scanty remains of clothes and other possessions, in the
vain hope of lighting upon something of a marketable
character, he suddenly took up a sheet of card-board
which in happier days he had destined for the sketches
at which he was an indifferent adept. He had evi-
dently formed a plan, however absurd: that was plain
from the odd smile which irradiated his features. He
descended the stairs to borrow of his landlady-what? |
A shilling?-By no means. A needle and thread, and
a pair of scissors. Then he took out his box of water-
colours and set to work. To design a picture?—Not a
bit of it: to make dancing-dolls!-Yes, the man with-
out a profession had found a trade. By the time it
was dusk he had made several figures with movable
legs and arms: one bore a rude resemblance to Napo-
leon; another, with scarcely excusable licence, repre-
sented the Pope; a third held the very devil up to
ridicule; and a fourth bore a hideous resemblance to
the grim King of Terrors himself! They were but
rude productions as works of art; but there was a
spirit and expression about them that toyshops rarely
exhibit. The ingenious manufacturer then sallied forth
with his merchandise. Within an hour afterwards he
might have been seen driving a bargain with a vagrant
dealer in odd notions,' as the Yankees would call
them. It is unnecessary to pursue our artist through
all his industrial progress. Enough that he is now one
of the most successful theatrical machinists, and in the
possession of a wife, a house, and a comfortable income.
He, too, had prospects, and he still has them-as far off
as ever. Fortunately for him, he 'prospected' on his
own account, and found a 'diggin'.
There is always something to be done if people will
only set about finding it out, and the chances are
ever in favour of activity. Whatever brings a man
in contact with his fellows may lead to fortune. Every
day brings new opportunities to the social worker; and
no man, if he has once seriously considered the subject,
need ever be at a loss as to what to do in the mean-
time. Volition is primitive motion, and where there is
a will there is a way.
ACADEMICAL EXPENSES.
THE public press has lately been putting forth some
strong remarks upon the subject of the expenses of an
English university education. The particular period
selected for their publication has been well chosen,
being the commencement of the academic year, and
with regard to the topic, few could be selected of more
universal interest. To a vast number of persons, rang-
ing from the middle-classes up to the nobles of the
land, Oxford and Cambridge are endeared by personal
acquaintance, and by all the nameless ties which bind
a student to alma mater; to a large section of the
talented and aspiring portion of the rising generation,
they are the theatre to which they look forward for
distinction and fame; and what is more important than
all, they are the chief nursing - places of those whose
influence for good or for evil is enhanced by the
prestige which belongs to an educated clergyman, whose
character and opinions are looked up to by many as a
standard of correctness and orthodoxy.
An able article of the Times comes to the conclusion,
that the university and college officials stand blameless,
and that the debts and difficulties into which so many
fall are to be attributed solely to the folly of the student.
The Daily News takes precisely the opposite opinion.
But as neither party gives more than a general outline
of the case, it has struck us that a candid statement of
the real position of the student will not be altogether
uninteresting; and we may add, that those into whose
hands this may fall may rest assured that its infor-
mation is based upon personal knowledge, and actuated
by neither partisanship nor antagonism.
The course of study at Oxford extends over a period
varying from three and a half to four and a half years;
at Cambridge, except under the special excuse of sick-
ness, the examination which terminates the curriculum
takes place three years and a half after entrance.
The apparently longer residence required by Oxford is
rendered still longer by a larger portion of the year
being given to the university than is required at Cam-
bridge, for the 'men' of the latter university go'down'
for the long vacation at or about the 1st of June, and
do not return until late in October; while at Oxford
almost the whole of June is spent in residence, and the
colleges open earlier in October there than at Cambridge.
Living is also a shade or two cheaper at Cambridge;
so that comparing the cheapest college of one with the
cheapest of the other, and taking into account the diffe-
rent length of residence required, the popular notion
regarding the higher expenses of Oxford may be assumed
to be a true one.
This point being settled, we come to the inquiry:
What is the expense of a university education? Now
it is evident that this will vary according to the
varying taste, if not according to the pockets of the
student. One may delight in driving tandem, in wearing
extensive waistcoats and voluminous ties; another may
aspire, with the aid of a few sovereigns, or the credit of
them, to be the choicest spirit, and give the most 'spicy'
wines of his college; while a third may satisfy himself
with spending as little, living as quietly, and reading
as hard as possible. Of course all these will give us
different answers, and we shall be as far from a solution
of our question as ever. The only way is to endeavour
to gather from some authentic source the amount
actually demanded by the college and university, and
to add for private expenses as near an approximation
to the true and necessary amount as possible. Now
for the former we are happily well provided in an
'Account of Expenses' calculated on an average for a
college at Cambridge, where of course we look for the
minimum charge and published in the Cambridge
Calendar by authority. Here it is:-

If we examine these items in order, we shall be able to
give a better and more systematic idea of the expenses
than would otherwise be practicable.
1. Tuition. This includes only the fees of the tutors
provided by the college. But for any man who desires
high honours in the classical or mathematical depart-
ment, the condition of the university is such that a private
tutor, or, in common parlance, a 'coach,' is absolutely
necessary. We are not at present concerned with the
right or the wrong of this system; we have only to do
with its accompanying expenses. These are L.7 a
term* for one hour every other day; L.14 for the same
time every day. It is farther to be.remarked, that if a
tutor is engaged for the Lent term, it is not considered
improper to form another engagement for the following
short' or Easter term, so that the expense is neces-
sarily incurred twice in the early part of the year.
*Three terms at Cambridge correspond to four at Oxford.
Private tutors at Oxford consider Easter and Trinity term as one.

2. Rooms. In some colleges this expense is much
lower in fact as low as L.6 a year; in others it
reaches to L.40, but of course the inhabiting the latter
kind of rooms is by no means a compulsory affair. It
will often happen, however, that the college is full; in
which case the student is compelled to live in lodgings,
of which the rent varies from 10s. upwards-half-price
being paid in vacations. It may be observed that at
Oxford the same ratio of rent prevails. Very good
rooms may be had-for instance, in St John's College
-at L.8 a year.
principal meal of the day is of course dinner, and this
is eaten at a common table in the college hall. In
fact, dinner is called simply 'hall.' The hour in most
colleges at Cambridge is four o'clock-we believe there
are only two exceptions to this rule; and the provision
in most cases is a supply of several joints of meat to
choose from, and potatoes. Bread, beer, pudding, sauce
of any kind, soups, fish, &c., are extras. This, then,
is the hall dinner, and this must be paid for whether

of course leave their own rooms for new-comers.
freshman, therefore, will most probably be introduced
to a dingy apartment, from which hearth-rug, sofa,
pictures, arm-chairs, &c., have been removed, and
nothing remains except what may be called a room's
necessaries of life. There may be a carpet, but
always in an awfully ragged and torn condition;
there may also be the things we have mentioned as
absent, though this is improbable; an empty set of
book-shelves, a few chairs, a table, a bedstead, and other
bedroom furniture, will generally comprise the whole
amount of available effects. If he does find rooms
already furnished, he may consider himself truly fortu-
nate. For what follows? Suppose the choice made,
and a certain room fixed upon-the next proceeding
is the valuation of the furniture left, and the determi-
nation whether to keep or dismiss each separate article,
which is entirely at the student's will. At Oxford-
at least in most of the colleges with which we are
acquainted--the only liberty allowed is either to take
or to reject the whole. This having been done, there
remains to supply the deficiencies of the establishment.
Crockery, glass, bed-furniture, the aforesaid hearth-rug,
and all the paraphernalia of a little house, have to be
replaced. And forth accordingly, probably under the
guidance of some patronising 'man,' goes the freshman,
proud of his new dignity and his independence, and, we
grieve to add- -as certain to be cheated in his purchases
as he is to purchase. But this takes us beyond the
limit of the distinct college expense, and for the present
we pass on.
3. Attendance, Taxes.-At Oxford, with the excep-
tion, we believe, of Pembroke College, female-servants
are unknown. At Cambridge, without exception,
women are the attendants. At Oxford the tribe is
divided into scouts and bedmakers; the former of whom
attend to the man, and the latter to the man's rooms.
At Cambridge the sole servant-with one exception,
as we shall explain-is the woman bedmaker,' who
'does for' you entirely. There is also a class of men,
named Gyps, who will attend upon you for a certain
fee; but this is an extra luxury, and the college does
not recognise them officially. As to taxes, it may be
mentioned that many men keep dogs, and some horses;
but the charge of taxes in the college bill is a very
unusual one.
4. Coals. Nothing need be said on this item, more
than that each man has his private coal-cellar, which
is filled weekly.
5. College Payments.-These being irrespective of a
man's style of living, need no remark. They are in-
cluded in the bills under such titles as 'Bursar,' 'Lamp
on the Stairs,' &c.
6. Food. We come now to a most important element
of the bill. Let us sec, in the first place, what is meant
by this L.20, 12s. 6d., or rather 16s. 6d. a week. The
There are two divisions of the provisioning depart-
ment in a Cambridge college: one, the buttery, from
whence all things that do not include meats are sent
out; the other, the kitchen, to supply the deficiencies
of the buttery. In both these offices the order of the
student is obeyed implicitly as to sending any amount
of provision, and with the exception of no cooking being
allowed on Sunday, or after ten at night, or between
twelve noon and six P.M., we know of no restricting
regulation. Almost every edible and potable, excepting
wines and spirits, is sent out from these establishments,
and charged at a high rate.
7. Laundress.-Washing is allowed to be an inevitable
expense. With the exception of one mythical man
who we have heard was once caught washing his own
stockings, we are not acquainted with any one who has
succeeded in evading this reasonable charge. It must
be remembered that sheets, towels, blankets, &c., come
into this item.
We have now examined, so far as it goes, the state-
ment of expenses put forward as the minimum by
the university of Cambridge; and the reader will be
enabled to see that, by rigid economy, and by avoiding
extras, the student will be able to confine himself—
although with difficulty-within these bounds. But it
is obvious that many things are left untouched by this
scheme. Of the necessity of private tutors something
has been already said. The great expense of books is
left entirely unnoticed; the unhappy necessity of dress-
ing decently is also forgotten; travelling expenses
are left unrecorded and unreckoned; and when it is
added to this that not one-half of the year is spent at
college, we shall immediately see how much disparity
there must be between the L.61, 2s. 10d. and the real
bill of expenses for a student's year.
It is necessary, then, to enter upon the more delicate
ground of extra expenditure, which may be enlarged
We will begin
to almost any conceivable amount.
by stating our opinion, and then giving our reasons for
it, that a student can live creditably and honourably
at Oxford for L.130, and at Cambridge for something
rather less per annum. The majority of men,' we
shall say, range higher than this, and a common
income is L.200; but so far as absolute necessity is
concerned, this is decidedly an easy allowance.
A college bill, of a moderate character, swells to
about L.9 more than the amount above shewn, and with
many men the remaining L.30 of the L.100 will suffice
for clothes if not for books. There are, then, to be
considered travelling and other expenses, of which we
may instance wine and grocery as considerable items
-the former being one without the incurrence of which
a 'man' is at once set down as a 'snob' by his more
illustrious associates. We say then, again, that upon
L.130 a year a student either at Oxford or Cambridge

can live quietly and respectably. Dissipation or extra-
vagance in any way is of course out of the question.
At the same time it cannot be denied that many live
on less than this, although it is only by dint of a
struggling economy. With regard to the other extreme
-that of going too far- we can only say, with the
Times, that the men who indulge in it will have to
blame their own folly and recklessness when they find
themselves at last in a maze of inextricable difficulty.
To preach a sermon, or to moralise in the old trite way
on youthful improvidence and rashness, is by no means
our object: we have rather desired to put plainly down
the statistics and the particulars of certain expenses
which many a father is desirous of ascertaining, with-
out knowing how to get at them.
He was very red when he landed with the exertion of
sitting so still, though he boasted of his charming row,
and said it was quite easy. Some were on horseback,
and some on ponyback; and a few adventurous pedes-
trians prepared to walk all the way, and to make a
great deal of the feat at the end.
The company was of the character usual at such
gatherings. There were one or two old-maids and old-
bachelors of local repute, of whom the latter were
generally supposed to be much desired by the former,
and of whom dark rumours of youthful prepossession
and unavailing attachments were afloat; and there
were several young married couples, one in particular
of great popularity, for the wee wifie was a laughing,
happy, pretty amiability, who made her husband's
home a little heaven, and was like sunshine in a
drawing-room; and there were many-oh! very many
of all degrees of matrimonial expectancy; and there
were a few unmarried men, of whom the most part
were strangers-Cantabs and tourists, with but a frac-
tion left for residents, and these more or less ineli-
and everything else that was necessary in the way of
gible. And there were chaperons and chaperonesses,
respectability and as social drags on flirting; and so
the Misses Boyle had got together the ingredients of a
very happy day.
THE PICNIC TO WATENDLATH.
THERE was to be a picnic to Watendlath. The
good-tempered Miss Boyles-or, more properly speak-unmarried girls of all shades of personableness, and
ing, the Misses Boyle-said they would have one next
Wednesday, and of course every person in Keswick
was anxious to be invited; for the Misses Boyle
were great favourites, and their parties were pro-
nounced the pleasantest of the neighbourhood, though
pseudo - fashionables have been heard to call them
vulgar. And there certainly was less ceremony and a
more hearty hospitality at Derwent House than the
æsthetics of social formalism permit; and there was
more honest fun, too, than starched cravats and white
kid gloves approve of; and dancing was encouraged in
the curate's very teeth; and simple nonsense-games,
and other innocent follies, were not deemed so mind-
less as your very intellectual people would have you
think them: for the Misses Boyle did not carve their
world of humanity out of intellect alone. They were
rational, easy-going, sensible women: neither Pompa-
dours nor Trappists; taking the blessings of life as
they came, in full enjoyment and perfect moderation,
and not thinking that they had a mission to set the
universe to rights, nor a divine right to question the
sanctity of the gifts of God.
Too old and too ordinary to excite the most transient
jealousy even with the vainest, but so youthful in
feeling that they were fit companions for children;
unselfish, active, and strong, therefore not curbing
enterprise nor slackening exertion; attentive to the
least attractive of their guests, respectful to the elder
-they were the very ideals of old-maids; generally
called 'nice' by people of delicacy, and allowed to be
'jolly' even by schoolboys and Cantabs. Now when
three old-maids are voted capital by youthful mascu-
lines, there must be something genial at least in them;
and when they are the favourites of children, there
must be something lovable in them; and when they
are honoured by the poor and respected by the old,
there must be something good in them.
Well, the day of the picnic arrived at last, and the
guests met by appointment at eleven o'clock near the
Barrow Gate, which leads up to Watendlath. They
came by all possible modes of civilised conveyance.
Some were in 'tubs,' as they are called at Keswick-
small open cars, which hold four people sitting side-
ways, and which are more safe than luxurious; and
some came by boats, in general of a round build, some-
thing after the model of coal-barges; and one youth,
of aquatic reputation, paddled himself up in a small
river-canoe, the only one on the lake, which upset if
you leaned an inch out of the perpendicular, and was
swamped if it met a wave bigger than a snow-flake.
But some of the guests require a more express
indication. For instance, there was a young lady
fresh from London, whose only country excursions had
been an occasional trip to Windsor, or Claremont, or
Esher, or haply Hampton and Richmond; who had no
idea of mountains beyond Primrose Hill, or of rocks
beyond those of the Swiss cottage at the Colosseum,
and who was very fastidious in most matters of life.
Her dress, too, was as remarkable as her mind and
manners; and altogether she was the most striking
person of the party. She was young, but not pretty,
with a beautiful complexion and fair hair; and she
was wonderfully content with her corporeal condition,
and quite satisfied that she was the belle of her circle.
She wore a lace bonnet that might have claimed the
prize at a botanical fête-it was so laden with flowers;
and over this was an expensive veil, that seemed of too
tender texture for anything but the safe-keeping of a
glass-case. She had, moreover, a pale shot-silk gown,
very Watteau-like and elegant, but sadly crushed by
the narrow dimensions of her peculiar tub.'
carried a small cerise parasol covered with a deep
dropping fringe; and this, together with Parisian boots
very thin about the soles, with a shadow on the toes,
which imaginative people believed to be leather, and
superstitious ones deemed a protection against stones
and mud, completed a costume which Jouvne's gloves,
that are so dear on account of the Hungarian war,
rendered fit for Bond Street or the Champs Elysées.
This was her attire for a rugged mountain-road and
a secluded mountain-tarn; and all the time a shower
was peeping over the top of Skiddaw in the shape of a
grim cloud, like the darkened eye of Polyphemus. The
young lady in question was Miss Marian Josephine
Montague.
She
There were others worthy of being chronicled too.
There was one young lady who had heard a great deal
about 'feminine softness' and 'womanly gentleness,'
and who had therefore made timidity her social re-
ligion. She shrieked very much when they tried to
lift her on a tired, worn-out old pony which had been
up Skiddaw before sunrise that day, and was standing
with its eyes closed and its head drooping, nodding
in a lazy sleep. But she vowed and protested that she
could not possibly mount it; and then, when she had
got fairly into the saddle, all in a heap, because the
pony moved its foot to get rid of a gadfly teasing it,

CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL.
she screamed loudly for help, and asked, 'What it was
doing, and why it was so frisky?' And when they
all really started, she kept up a running commentary
on the deeds of her horse, wondering why he shook
his head, or why his sides quivered. But she got to
Watendlath at last without any special damage. Then
there was a brave young lady of high animal spirits,
who put on her brother's hat and vaulted into a gentle-
man's saddle, and rode the spirited bay all the distance
to the tarn. And there was a shy young gentleman,
who lisped, and who found his hands and arms great
encumbrances and painful drawbacks on his serenity
of mind. There was a venturesome young gentleman,
short and clumsy, who dashed at everything, and
always failed, but who never allowed the possibility of
a superior, from mathematics down to cricket-playing.
And there was a proud young gentleman, remotely
connected with a bishop, who would not make friends
with anybody, and who looked very stiff and awful.
And then there were some nice people, who were of
rational understandings, and pleasant to talk to.
But the best of all the youths was a handsome young
sailor just returned from a long voyage; and the best
of all the maidens was a pretty little orphan, looking
out for a governess's situation. Their names were
respectively Gerald Mayne and Rose Dysart, and they
had known each other about six weeks-not longer.
:
At the Barrow Gate a general readjustment took
place. Families dispersed themselves among different
tubs-voting it stupid to be always with one's
brothers and sisters; and a few young ladies persisted
in walking it was shrewdly surmised by the more
passées that they wished to have a gentleman all to
themselves, and that's why they wanted to walk; and,
ugh! how horrible it was to see such boldness! And at
last, after a great deal of discussion, and laughter and
merriment, the cavalcade proceeded-tubs, horsemen,
pony-women, walkers of both sexes, and a few stray
dogs. They were a very merry party, and startled the
echoes of old Wallow Crag as they wound about his
base with sounds as musical and glee as pure as when
the Derwentwater nobles hunted and hawked over the
hills of their princely carldom.
Now it chanced that Miss Marian Josephine Montague
and pretty little Rose Dysart were in the same car,
together with one of the Misses Boyle and the bonnie
wee wifie-dear Mary Hunt. Miss Boyle, for it was
the eldest, sweet, motherly, bright in heart's eye;
Rose Dysart, one radiant blush of happiness, one mute
but eloquent song of innocence and joy speaking on
her lip, glowing on her cheek, playing in the light of
her eye, and resting on her brow like sunshine on the
water-one spirit-word of blessedness that sounded,
you knew not how nor when, in perfect harmony with
the bright sunshine over head and the lovely flowers
by the way; and Mary Hunt, calmer in her smiles
than Rose, merrier too, as one who has passed by all fear
and lived through her hour of doubt, her sweet voice
thrilling through the air in snatches of song or childlike
bursts of laughter: they made up a beautiful and a happy
trio, different, yet all in unison, like the perfect parts
of a masterly song. But the fourth-sitting in her cloud
of colours and glistering wealth-how did she fare?
With the gloom on her brow, and the sharp line about
her lip, and the restless glance of her eye, and the
studied motion of her hand and head, she looks but ill
at ease! And so she was, for Gerald Mayne would
talk more to Rose than to her; and she had taken
a fancy to his handsome face.
The road to Watendiath is none of the most luxurious.
It might have been paved by the giants before the flood,
or have stood proxy for Macadamisation in the days of
the sons of Anak-anyway, it is not like walking on a
smooth-shaven lawn. It is composed of rocks and
cart-ruts, amongst which you must guide your horse or
your tub as is most convenient for the preservation of
your osteological system. But it is nothing when you
are used to it; and with such wonderful scenery about
you, and in the heart of a merry party, the very
roughness of the transit gives an additional zest to the
pleasure, or ought to do so, with all reasonable people.
But Miss Montague was sadly disturbed. First one
wheel of the car mounted up in the air with a sudden
jerk, and the other delved deep into the earth, as if
on a mining expedition; then both came to a level
with a plunge that shook the occupants to the heart,
that made their knees and elbows jar; then the horse
got into a smooth shelf of slate, of which there were
many 'cropping out,' as geologists say, on the face of
the rugged road; and if it was on a steep hill, as was
generally the case, he would slide down with all four
legs together, the car following heavily on his quarters,
according to the laws of dynamic progression; then the
narrow way was still farther narrowed by a heap of
stones, or the broken stump of a tree, or it might be a
country cart, which had to draw up into the hedge until
it was nearly at right angles with the road, or else to rush
into the wood among the brushwood and brambles and
decayed roots, until you marvelled if it could by any
possibility ever be extricated again; then three or four
shepherd-dogs would come out barking furiously, as if
the whole world of sound had become one gigantic
yelp; and then there would be a canine battle with
all the picnic dogs-the ladies shrieking in concert.
In the midst of all this Marian Josephine Montague
felt sadly out of place, with her butterfly wings flutter-
ing through the wildness of a Cumberland mountain-
path. Her flower-shaped parasol brushed off the
dewdrops from the overhanging trees in sparkling
showers over her lace and Watteau-like silk; her pale
fawn gloves were soiled and spoiled; her beautiful veil
was torn in two places by a bramble-bush; her boots had
got wet through during the single moment of changing
cars, for it is always wet in Keswick; and altogether
she was in the most miserable condition possible. Poor
Marian! her nerves were sorely tried too by the road.
At every fresh jolt she screamed in her little sharp,
Frenchified way, and tossed her head in utter disgust
at the whole thing. She had never seen such a car in
her life-it was perfectly shocking; and then the driver
he spoke so broadly she could not understand him.
And what a road! Fancy how uncivilised and savage
the people must be who could live in such a place! And
how wild the hedges were-full of weeds, and not kept
neat or trim at all! And how dreadful all these dogs
were! And what a set of people altogether! What
dressing! what gloves! what manners! Mon Dieu! but
she had never been accustomed to such savagery, and
she felt that she quite manquéd her métier there! She
was a person of extreme delicacy and sensibility, and
she could not understand how people could be so rough
and unpolished as to like such a day as this!'
Miss Boyle and Mary Hunt endeavoured to console
the London lady. They laughed at her fears, and would
have soothed down her temper, but the more they tried
to comfort her the deeper grew her frown, the sharper
her voice. She appealed to Gerald Mayne: was she
not much to be pitied?-she, coming from town, and
accustomed to all the bienséances of life, to be suddenly
thrust into such society? But Gerald Mayne laughed,
and said she deserved no pity, for it was all delightful
the very roughness of the road made the pleasure of
the trip greater; and if it would only not rain, they
would have a picnic fit for emperors and queens. But
he was afraid they would be caught after all, for
the sky looked so very threatening. And for the
hearty sailor-way in which he spoke he was rewarded
with the sweetest of smiles from dear Rose, and with
sundry nods of approbation from Miss Boyle and pretty
Mrs Hunt. The mention of the word rain threw Miss
Montague into French hysterics, which lasted until the
party arrived at the tarn.

Then came the unpacking-then poured out chickens
and tongues, and patés and salads, and wine and ale, and
cakes and cream, salt, sugar, and sauces, fore-quarters
of lamb, and Brobdignagian cucumbers to match; and
then came all sorts of surprises-of cream in wine-
bottles, and fresh fruit in potted game dishes; and at
every discovery there was a general shriek of laughter,
and one universal exclamation of wonder, though every
one had seen the same things done before at every
picnic ever given at Keswick within the memory of
man. But they were all so happy that they were
easily amused: like children who, how often soever
you cry Peep-bo,' still answer you back with a laugh,
and are never tired of being astonished by the same
thing.
"
Well, the cloaks and shawls were spread on the
ground in the most convenient situations that could be
found, and down they all sat, grouped in every variety
of colour and action, for the most part engaged in
several species of flirtation, according to the fancies of
the individuals. The clumsy young man and the
spirited young lady sat together; and he was obliged
to undergo no little sarcasm from his fair rival, who
ridiculed his horsemanship to his face, and made
nothing of his cricketing or vaulting. And the timid
young lady enlisted the sympathies of a very young
Cantab, who with inimitable patience beat the ground
for toads or ants, or other small deer, and who thought
what a nice girl she was-so ladylike and feminine.
But he was a very young man. Miss Montague's
splendour shone by Rose Dysart's simple mourning,
and the two figures looked very well together, for they
were in good contrast, and both perfect in their way.
Gerald Mayne was with them; and his handsome face,
with fair curling hair and merry blue eyes, never
looked to greater advantage than now, when it shone
like a sunny landscape full of life and love between the
beauty and the elegance of his two companions-for
Rose was beautiful, and Miss Montague undeniably
elegant.
In a short time it came on to rain: of course it did;
it never does anything else at Keswick. Was there
ever a picnic among those treacherous old mountains
which did not receive its water-supply gratis, without
rate or committee? What with Borrowdale sops, and
Skiddaw nightcaps, and Basanthwaite cloud-banks, and
white cravats about the throats of the mountains
generally, the almost universal meteorological predic-
tions of Keswick are rain and rain again. If
local accidents have worked all the physiological
phenomena, it seems strange that Cumberland people
are not born webfooted. If the black man is black
because of the tropical line, why should not the
Keswickian be duck-legged because of the topical
cloud? Dr Prichard might make something of this
question. But who cares for rain at a picnic? What
though the salt disappears, changing its normal con-
dition of crystalline particles into a liquid mass, that
does not improve the currant - tart nor the custard
amongst which it flows-and the sugar undergoes the
same metempsychosis among the cucumbers and the
chickens: what though the fire hisses sullenly under
the miniature waterspout that leaps down among its
embers, and tries the respective strength of the rival
elements: what though the rain drips off the umbrellas
in uncomfortable pools on your knees-your shoulders
become large conduits for the whalebone gargoyles
above: what though you gather up your feet from their
places with an uncomfortable feeling about the soles,
and find that they leave an aqueous deposit behind
them: what though you see catarrh and rheumatism in
every wet dock-leaf you sit near, and in every fresh
fountain you receive from your gargoyles-who cares
for such things at a picnic? The blacker the cloud the
louder the laugh. If the day is not to be perfect, then
let extremes meet, and have the worst you can find.
An army of umbrellas sprang up as the shower
came down. They looked like large mushrooms on the
hill-side-fairy canopies under the Polytechnic micro-
scope. Beneath one-and a very large, faded, cotton,
gig umbrella it was-sat Rose Dysart and Gerald
Mayne. They were obliged to sit close together to be
properly covered, and in doing so Rose's shawl slipped
off her shoulders, and Gerald must place it round them
again. He said he would pin it, but he was a long time
about it; and Rose was so confused somehow that she
forgot to tell him to be quicker. She took the umbrella
in the meantime, and as it was large and heavy, she
could not hold it very high: it sunk down in her
pretty little hand till it quite concealed them both from
every eye but their own.
It is a
Gerald pinned the shawl very carefully. Rose's
cheeks were crimson, and her heart was beating as
though it would burst. Gerald's hand was unsteady-it
trembled visibly. Poor young man! his night-watches
on board had evidently shattered his nerves.
pity, isn't it, that so young a man should be so shaken?
Neither spoke. As to Rose the whole world was silent.
She heard nothing, she saw nothing, she knew nothing
but the face before her-the spirit which dwelt between
her and that noble heart-the sweet, strange word
which had not sounded yet, but which was hovering
like an odorous atmosphere about them. The unruly
shawl! the trembling hand! Hearts, will ye break
beneath your tumult? Hush heaven and earth! Two
souls that loved before they lived have met each other
again, and are recognising the familiar features beneath
the strange mask of flesh.
'Rose, I love you!' whispered Gerald; 'will you love
me, and be my wife?'
Words short, abrupt, and hurried, but containing in
them the weal or wo of two mortal beings.
The small hand lay cold as stone in his-the deep-
gray eye drooped bashfully beneath the lid-the blood
shot over cheek and neck, and then fled back, and left
the pale, clear skin colourless as marble; but the sweet
lips parted slow, and one gentle word came forth as a
humming-bird from a flower, and . Rose Dysart's little
'Yes' sealed on earth the compact which had been
made in heaven among the angels.
Miss Marian Josephine Montague was in a pitiable
state. She was wet, and cold, and hungry, and she
refused everything that was offered to her with such a
fastidious air that people stared and laughed among
themselves; and those who did not know her, imagined
her to be an earl's daughter at least. Even the cream
and the currant tarts she exclaimed were execrable,
and the people who provided them heard her say so.
But it ended, as it generally does in such cases, by her
making a wonderful dinner, and declaring that she had
eaten nothing-she was so delicate.
6
The rain was not of long duration. It passed off as
quickly as it came, and then the brave old mountains
stood out all the better for the washing. The rocks
were like molten silver when the sun shone on them
trickling with water, while little tufts of wet moss and
fern were sprinkled over them like diamonds strung
with emeralds; the ravines were so sharp and clear,
every stone might almost be counted; and the sheep
and cattle on the hills were points of high light' in
the landscape, which would have sent a conscientious
painter hopelessly mad. The flowers and leaves by
the way-side were bright with rain, and the sun-
light lay entangled in them like threads of silver or
locks of burnished gold. The birds sang as if it were
a spring morning; and the insects buzzed out in
merry myriads, humming through the air in troops
that cast a shadow as they flew. Every one cried
'How beautiful!' as some new effect of cloud or
light burst on them. But Miss Montague shivered,
and said that it was the most wretched day she had
ever passed; and what could people find to admire in

And how
those stupid rocks and hideous mountains!
absurd it was to make such a fuss about a few weeds
and rain-drops! She did not gather a large audience,
though, to attend to her; but some of the people looked
reverently, and wondered who this young lady could
be, for she must be so fine and clever to find such fault
with everything that others liked!
Blessed, pure, and good, Rose and Gerald often speak
of the happy picnic to Watendlath as they would
speak of a baptism into a world of light; and though
they have not formally claimed the Dunmow Flitch,
it is not for want of deserving it; for from the day of
their marriage they have never once regretted the
Misses Boyles' happy party, nor the terrible shower
which brought them close together under the gig
umbrella of washed-out green. The Misses Boyle too,
good, innocent women, have stood godmothers to so
many little Maynes they sometimes forget the count.
But somehow they always remember each individual
on his or her birthday, when presents and sage advice
remind the youthful citizens of their dear old sponsors
at Keswick.
After dinner was over, and the people had shaken
off the wet like so many water-dogs, the shawls and
cloaks were hung up to dry, and the fragments of the
feast repacked. And when all this was done the gentle-
men began to leap. Some leaped well, some couldn't
go higher than a few feet, others shook their heads, and
declined; the clumsy young gentleman made a dash
with a leaping-pole, but refused when he got near, and

But his self-depreciation brought fresh applause, and
Rose Dysart's heart was filled with such intense delight
she dared not analyse it, lest it should escape in the
knowledge. Poor, simple Rose! volumes could not
express her childlike simplicity more than this little
anecdote of her passionate happiness on hearing her
lover's leaping praised.
They walked round by Borrowdale-at least some of
the party, and Rose was of the number; and then and
there was cemented that half-carved piece of love's own
workmanship which they had begun to fashion under
the faded cotton umbrella. Miss Montague often won-
dered what they could be talking about that was so
interesting; but Miss Boyle, to whom she applied with
a peculiar laugh, could not enlighten her, and it was
not until some months after that she knew; and then
the Times told her in an advertisement. Mary Hunt
guessed-so did the dear old-maids; and Mary Hunt
forced the confession from Rose next day, when she
went for the express purpose. And poor orphaned
Rose, how glad she was, amongst her other causes of
happiness, that she was not obliged now to go out as
a governess, and that she would have a home of her
own, with some one to look after her and take care of
her! Poor little flower, that stood trembling at the
sound of the distant blast, and crouching behind its
leaves, fearing that the distant would be soon near at
hand; though no rare Indian gem, no priceless exotic,
no rich golden treasure, thou art a fair young bud on
which the heavens smiled kindly when thou wert born,
and to whom nature gave the best bounties of her
treasury when thou wast dowered!
How happy she was! how innocent! how pure!
Her small caresses, her faint words of love, her shy
glances, her soft blushes, all spoke eloquently of the
depth and the purity of the heart within. And Gerald,
as he drew his wee lassie to him, thought how much
he had been blessed beyond his deserts, and wondered
what he had ever done that Heaven should have
rewarded him so well.
THE ASS OF LA MARCA.
1. THE HOG-BOY.
In the year 1530, a Franciscan was travelling on foot in
the papal territory of Ancona. He was proceeding to
Ascoli; but at that time the roads were bad, where
there were any roads at all, and after wandering in
what appeared to be a wilderness, he lost his bearings
altogether and came to a stand-still. A village was
visible in the distance, but he was unwilling to proceed
so far to ask his way, lest it might prove to be in the
wrong direction.
While listening intently, however,
for some sound that might indicate the propinquity of
human beings-for the scrubby wood of the waste,
marshy land intercepted his view-he heard what ap-
peared to be a succession of low sobs close by. Mounting
a little eminence a few paces off, he saw a small company
of hogs widely scattered, and searching with the avidity
of famine for a dinner; and rightly conjecturing that
the sounds of human grief must proceed from the
swineherd, he moved on to the nearest clump of bushes,
where he saw on the other side a boy about nine years
of age lying upon the soft ground, and endeavouring to
smother his sobs in a tuft of coarse moss, while he dug
his fingers into the mud in an agony of grief and rage.
The good father allowed the storm of emotion to sweep
past, and then inquired what was the matter.
'Have you lost any of your hogs?' said he.
'I don't know-and I don't care,' was the answer.
'Why were you crying then?'
'Because they have been using me worse than a
hog: they have been beating me-they never let me
alone; always bad names, and worse blows; nothing

to eat but leavings, and nothing to lie upon but dirty as if the nails were embedded in his flesh; and one arm,
straw!'
'And for what offence are you used thus?'
'They say I am unhandy at field-work; that I am
useless in the house and the barn; that I am unfit to
be a servant to the horses in the stable; and that I can't
even keep the hogs together. They are hogs them-
selves-they be! I was clever enough at home; but
my father could not keep me any longer, and so he
sent me to be a farmer's drudge, and turned me out to
the-the-hogs!' and the boy gave way to another
passionate burst of grief. The Franciscan endeavoured
to soothe him, and talked of submission to Providence;
but finding he could do no good he inquired the name
of the village.
'Montalto,' replied the boy sulkily.
'Montalto? Then in which direction lies Ascoli?'
trembling with agitation, was stretched forth in a fierce
farewell. When he turned away, the blazing eyes
instant they softened, grew mild and tearful, and Felix
again flashed upon the Franciscan's face; but in an
-for that was the lad's name-followed his patron
meekly into the town.
Their destination was a monastery of Cordeliers,
where the ex-hog-boy was introduced to the superior,
and pleased him so much by his sensible answers and
modest demeanour that he at once received the habit
of a lay-brother, and was set to assist the sacristan in
leisure hours he was still busier with the dust of the
sweeping the church and lighting the candles. But at
schools, and the lamp of theology. The brethren taught
him the responses and grammar; but he never ceased
to teach himself everything he could get at; so that in
the year 1534, when he was only fourteen, he was
permitted to enter on his novitiate, and after the usual
probation to make his profession. He was, in short, a
been ordained a priest, and graduated as bachelor and
monk; and in ten years he had taken deacon's orders,
doctor. Felix the hog-boy was now known as Father
Montalto.
II. THE ASS.
The world was now before the Ancona hog-boy. In
his boyhood he had suffered stripes and starvation,
herded unclean animals, and almost broken his heart
he had been the patient drudge of a convent, and passed
with impotent and therefore secret rage. In his youth
his leisure hours in persevering study, and the accumu
Are you going to Ascoli?' demanded the hog-boy
suddenly, as he fixed a pair of blazing eyes on the Fran-
ciscan's face in a manner that made him start. 'I will
shew you the way,' continued he in a tone of as much
decision as if he spoke of some mighty enterprise; and
leaping to his feet like a boy made of Indian-rubber, he
led through the scrubby wood of the common, kicking
the hogs aside with a fierceness that drew a remon-
strance from the good father. This seemed to have the
desired effect. His manner softened instantaneously.
He spoke in a mild, low voice; answered the questions
that were addressed to him with modesty and good-lation of book- knowledge. But now he was a man,
sense; and astonished the Franciscan by a display of
intelligence rare enough even where natural abilities
are developed by education. It was in vain, however,
that he reminded his young companion that it was time
for him to turn: the hog-boy seemed fascinated by the
father's conversation, and always made some excuse for
accompanying him a little farther.
'Come, my son,' said the Franciscan at length, 'this
must have an end, and here we part. There is a little
trifle which I give you with my blessing, and so God
speed you!'
'I am going farther,' replied the boy quickly.
'What! to Ascoli?'
'Ay, to Ascoli-or to the end of the earth! Ah,
father, if you would but get me something to do-for I
am sure you can if you will; any drudgery, however
humble-anything in the world but tending hogs!'
'You forget my profession, my son, and that I am
powerless out of it. You would not become a monk
yourself?'
'A monk! Oh! wouldn't I? Only try me!'
To be a monk is to toil, watch, and pray; to live
meagrely, to submit to innumerable hardships'-
'And to learn, father!-to read, to think!-O what
would I not submit to for the sake of knowing what
there is in books!' The boy spoke with enthusiasm,
and yet with nothing of the coarse impetuosity which
had at first almost terrified his new acquaintance. The
Franciscan thought he beheld in him the elements of a
character well adapted for a religious order; and after
some farther conversation, he finally consented to take
the stripling with him to Ascoli. They were now at the
summit of an eminence whence they saw that town
lying before them, and the village of Montalto hardly
discernible in the distance behind. The father looked
back for a moment at his companion in some curiosity
to see how he would take leave, probably for ever, of the
place of his birth. The hog-boy's hands were clenched
ready for his destiny, and in the midst of troublous
times, when a bold, fierce, and fearless character is sure
to make its way. No more secret sobs, no more
cringing servility, no more studious solitude. Montalto
threw himself into the vortex of the world, and struck
temper, and haughty and dictatorial manner, were now
out boldly, right and left. An impetuous and impatient
his prominent characteristics; and these, united as they
were with natural talent and solid acquirements, soon
pointed him out for congenial employment. The rising
monk was seen and understood by the Cardinals Carpi
and Alexandrino; and by the latter he was appointed
Inquisitor-general at Venice. Here was fortune for the
poor trampled boy of Ancona! But to rest there was
not his purpose. A little of the tranquillity he knew
so well how to assume, or even the mere abstinence from
violence and insult, would have retained him in his
post; but instead of this he became harsh, stern, and
peremptory to a degree that outraged everybody who
came near him, and carried out the measures he deter-
mined on with an arbitrary vehemence that bordered
on frenzy. The jealous republicans were astonished,
but not terrified: the liberties of their strange tyranny
were at stake: and at length the Venetian magnates
rose like one man, and Father Montalto only escaped
personal violence by flight. And so he was a martyr
to the cause of the church! And so all eyes were
drawn upon him, as a man ready in action and inflex-
ible in will. He was now invited by the Cardinal
chaplain and inquisitorial adviser, the cardinal being
Buon-Campagno to accompany him to Madrid as his
sent thither as legate from the pope to his Catholic
majesty. Montalto's was an office both of power and
dignity, and he acquitted himself in it so zealously,
that on the legate's recall he was offered all sorts of
ecclesiastical honours and preferment to induce him to
settle in Spain. But the monk had other aspirations.
The news of the death of Pius IV. had reached Madrid,
and Montalto's patron, Cardinal Alexandrino, would
doubtless succeed to the papal throne. He would want
assistance, and, what is more, he could repay it; and
Father Montalto, rejecting the Spanish offers, hastened
to Rome. He found his friend, now Pius V., mindful

of his former services, and perhaps flattered by the
reputation which his protégé had made in the world.
He was kindly received, and immediately appointed
general of his order.
And now the ci-devant hog-boy set to sweep the
church anew, but in a different way. He no longer
troubled himself with theological controversies, but
punished his contumacious opponents. In four years
after the accession of the new pope he was made a
bishop, and handsomely pensioned; and in the year
1570 our adventurer was admitted into the college of
cardinals.
Montalto was now fifty years of age, when the will
is at its proudest, and the intellectual nature smiles at
the changing hair and its prophecies of physical decay.
It might be supposed that the fierce inquisitor ripened
into the stern and inflexible cardinal; but no such
process of development took place. And truly it would
have been somewhat inconvenient as matters stood;
for his new associates-ranking with kings every man
of them, hog-boy and all!-were the intellectual flower
of the time, deep and sagacious statesmen, immersed in
a game of policy of which the tiara was the prize, and
qualified for the lofty contention not more by their
talents than by the blood of the Medici, the Caraffa,
the Colonna, and the Frangipani, that flowed in their
veins. The wild nature of Montalto appeared to be
awed by the association into which he had thus been
elevated. It seemed as if a vision of his stripes, and
his hogs, and his besoms came back upon him, and he
walked gingerly along the marble floors of the Vatican,
as if alarmed at the echo. He became mild, affable, good-
natured; his business was over in the world; he had no-
thing more to do than to enjoy. Why should he concern
himself with intrigues in which he could have no possible
interest? Why should he permit even his own family
to disturb his dignified repose? One of his nephews,
on his way to Rome to see his prodigious uncle and
claim his favour, was murdered; but the cardinal, so
ready in former days to punish even crimes of thought,
interceded for the pardon of the assassin. The relatives
who did arrive at the Mecca of their pilgrimage he
lodged at an inn, and sent them home to their families
the next day with a small present, telling them to
trouble him no more. The only promise he made for
the future was that by and by, when old age and its
infirmities came on, he might perhaps send for one of
them to nurse his declining years.
Time wore on, and his patron, Pope Pius V., died
and was buried. This was a trouble as well as a grief
to our cardinal; for, being obliged to enter the con-
clave like the rest, he was asked by one and another
for his vote. How should he vote? He did not know
whom to vote for. He was an obscure and insignificant
man-he was; and the rest were all so admirably well-
fitted to be pope, that he could not tell the difference.
Besides, this was the first conclave he had been in, and
in a path so much loftier than he was accustomed to
tread, he was afraid of making a false step. He only
wished he could vote for them all; but, as it was, he
entreated them to manage the affair without him. And
so they did; and Cardinal Buon - Campagno being
elected, assumed the papal crown and the name of
Gregory XIII.
As for Montalto, he grew more meek, modest, and
humble every day. He lived frugally, even meanly con-
sidering his rank, and gave the residue of his income to
the poor. He submitted patiently to all sorts of insults
and injuries, and not only forgave his enemies, but
treated them with the utmost tenderness. At this time
a change appeared to take place in his health. Violent
internal pains destroyed his repose; and although he
consulted all the doctors in Rome, and took physic from
them all, he got no better. His disease was not the
less lamentable that it was nameless. He grew thin
and pale. Some said he took too much medicine. He
leaned heavily on his staff. His body was bent towards
the ground: he seemed like a man who was looking
for his grave. Public prayers were offered up in the
churches for his recovery; and sometimes with so
much effect, that he appeared to be a little convalescent.
At such intervals, being humble himself, he delighted
to converse with humble persons-such as the domes-
tics of cardinals and ambassadors; and, above all
things, auricular confession, if it had not been the sick
man's duty, would have been called his hobby. He
confessed everybody he could bring to his knees: his
mind became a sink through which constantly poured
all the iniquities of Rome. His brother cardinals smiled
at these weaknesses. The poor man was doubtless
sinking into premature dotage. They gave him in
ridicule a name taken from the muddy wastes of
Ancona in the midst of which he had been picked up
by the stray Franciscan: they called him THE ASS OF
LA MARCA.
III. THE POPE.
Time wore on in this way, till at length Gregory XIII.
died. The event took place at a perplexing moment,
for never had the college of cardinals been so completely
torn asunder by conflicting interests. There were three
powerful parties so singularly well-balanced that each
felt sure of being able to elect the new pope, and the
poor Ass of La Marca, who was once more obliged to
join the conclave, was half distracted with their various
claims. All they cared about was his vote; but that
was important. They were compelled, however, by
tradition, to go through the form of consulting him
from time to time; and the cardinal, though never
giving way to impatience, was pathetic in his entreaties
to be let alone. According to the custom of this
solemn council, each member of the holy college was
shut up in a separate room; and the messengers always
found Montalto's door bolted. He would reply to their
eminences, he said, the moment his cough abated, the
moment he felt any intermission of his excruciating
pains. But why could they not proceed to business
without him? The opinions of so insignificant a
person could not at any time be necessary; but surely
it was inhuman to disturb a man fast sinking under
disease, and whose thoughts were fixed upon that world
to which he was hastening. The conclave sat fourteen
days, and even then the votes of the three parties were
equally divided. What was to be done? The best way
was to have a nominal pope for the shortest possible
time, so that the struggle of the real competitors might
begin anew. They accordingly elected unanimously to
the papal throne--the Ass of La Marca!
On this announcement the new monarch came in-
stantly forth from his cell, leaving behind him his staff,
his cough, his stoop, his pains, his infirmities, and his
humility! He advanced with an erect figure, and a
firm and dignified step into the midst of the conclave,
and thanked their eminences for the honour they had
conferred upon him, which he would endeavour to merit
by discharging its high functions conscientiously.
he passed from the sacred council the vivas of the
people rent the air. Long live the pope!' they cried ;
justice, plenty, and large loaves!'
Address your-
selves to God for plenty,' was the answer; 'I will give

And he kept his word: ready, stern, severe, in-
flexible, impartial justice! He was impatient to see
the triple crown; and before preparations could be
made for his coronation, he caused the bauble to be
produced, and placed on a velvet cushion in the room
where he sat. The bauble? It was no bauble to him.
It was the symbol of Power, just as he was himself
the personification of Will. It was the thought which
had governed his whole life—which had blazed even
in the unconscious eyes of his boyhood. With what
memories was that long gaze filled-with what re-

solves! The room was crowded with spectres of the
past and visions of the future, that met and blended
in one homogeneous character; and as Pope Sixtus
V. rose from his chair, he felt proudly that there rose
with him—within him-throughout him-the hog-boy
of Montalto.
The dissimulation which was so remarkable a trait
in this remarkable character was now at an end, and
only the fierceness, sternness, and indomitable will of
the man remained. He felt himself to be placed on a
height from which everything beneath him appeared
on one level. The cardinals, with their ancient blood
and accomplished statesmanship, were no more to him
than the meanest drudges in his dominions; and when
they first attempted remonstrance at his proceed-
ings, he answered them with such withering disdain,
that the proudest of them quailed beneath his eye.
He told them distinctly that he was not only their
spiritual head but their temporal king, and that in
neither capacity would he brook any interference with
his authority. It was the custom, on the accession of
a pope, for the prisoners to be manumitted in all the
jails of Rome; and the consequence of this equivocal
mercy was, that these places of durance were always
full at such a time-the whole villany of the city tak-
ing the opportunity of committing murders, robberies,
and other great crimes that would be cheaply visited
by a brief imprisonment. When Sixtus was asked, as
a matter of form, for his sanction to the discharge of
the prisoners, he peremptorily refused it. In vain the
members of the holy college, in vain the civic autho-
rities, implored him not to set tradition at defiance: he
ordered for instant execution those legally deserving of
death, and in the case of the others, did not abate a
single day of their confinement. Even the respect paid
to his own person by the populace became a crime,
since it interfered with his designs. The perpetual
vivas with which he was greeted made his whereabout
so public that he could not come unawares into any
suspected place, and he issued an order forbidding such
demonstrations. One day, however, two citizens were
so enthusiastic in their loyalty that they could not
repress the cry of 'Long live the Pope!' which rose
to their lips; whereupon the offenders were instantly
laid hold of by the orders of Sixtus, and received a
hearty flogging.
This parvenu pope treated with other monarchs with
the unbending dignity which might have been looked
for in the descendant of a line of kings; and in some
cases-more especially that of Spain-he exhibited the
uncompromising sternness of his character. But
where the interest of his policy was not involved
where the actors in the drama of life moved in circles
that had no contact with his-he admired with all
his impulsive soul a masculine and independent
spirit. So far did he carry his admiration of our
Protestant Queen Elizabeth, who was his contemporary,
that one might almost fancy the solitary monk day.
dreaming of those times when even popes were per-
mitted a mortal bride. He is said to have given her
secret intimation of the approaching Armada of his
Catholic majesty; and when the head of the Catholic
Queen of Scotland rolled under the axe of the execu-
tioner, he is described as having emitted an exclamation
of fierce and exulting applause at this memorable
exhibition of will and power.
And so Sixtus lived, and reigned, and died-a stern,
strong spirit of his day and generation, leaving a broad
trail in history, and a lasting monument in the archi-
tectural stones of Rome. In the biography of common
men, who are swayed by changing currents of passion
and circumstance, it would be vain to attempt to
explain actions and reconcile inconsistencies, as we
have done here, by viewing all their doings, and all
the phases of their character, with reference to a
leading principle. But Sixtus was governed from his
birth by one great thought, though fully developed
only by the force of events-a thought as obvious in
the hog-boy of Ancona, or the drudge of the Cordeliers,
as in the monk Montalto, the inquisitor, the cardinal,
and the pope.
FREAKS OF THE ENGLISH ABROAD.
JOHN BULL is certainly a strange animal. So long as
he is in his own country, he is as quiet and harmless as
a lamb; but no sooner does he set his foot on foreign
land, than his nature undergoes a perfect change-he
becomes, as it were, transformed. The lion, or perhaps
more properly speaking, the bear, taking the place of
the lamb in his composition, he begins to growl and
look savage. Sometimes he scatters about his money
with haughty liberality; sometimes he abuses every-
thing and everybody around him; and not unfrequently
he commits such outrages on persons and things as
he would never for a moment think of in his native
land. In all my travels I have found him the same
everywhere: he is a marked character; he will not
submit to the good old advice: When in Rome, do as
Rome does,' but will have his own way after his own
fashion. If, for instance, he is in a Catholic country, he
enters the churches, asks to see the relics, shrines, &c., to
satisfy his curiosity-for Johnny is curious enough when
abroad-and when they are shewn to him, he laughs.
He has also the habit of walking about and talking loud
during divine service, which he thinks shews his con-
sequence, forgetting that he is in the house of prayer.
Again, if he meets a funeral or religious procession in
the street, he positively refuses to take his hat off-
why should he?-but it often happens that it is taken
off for him, whereupon he shews fight. Then he must
needs write, cut his name, or leave some mark of his
pilgrimage wherever he goes, whether it be on a beau-
tiful statue, column, ruin, or church: take, for example,
plain William Thomson, Newcastle,' as it appears
on Pompey's Pillar at Alexandria, written with a
tar-brush in letters larger than the gigantic mind
of Julian ever conceived. Go to the Lazaretto at
Malta, examine the soft stone floors, and they will
inform you in true tablet style-skull, cross-bones, and
all-that sundry bodies, including those of 'John Smith
and his beloved wife, both of London, have reposed
there in peace during the space of ten days, looking
forward to a happy release.' Come, let us mount to the
top of the Great Pyramid, and find if you can a single
square inch uncut: visit Jerusalem, the Holy City,
walk through its streets, behold its ancient walls, even
the Arch of Ecce Homo in the Via Dolorosa, and see
there, in good bold English type, 'Try Holloway's Pills.'
Let us leave Jerusalem, proceed towards Jaffa, but rest
at the hospitable convent at Ramalie, and on one of the
bedroom doors we shall see among a host of illus-
trious names that of B. D'Israeli, 1831,' under which
some wag has inscribed Old clo! Old clo!'
John has another little eccentricity: he likes to pay
more for everything he buys or sees than anybody else,
yet he tries to appear not to like it, and constantly
complains of being cheated and robbed. Go to Switzer-
land, or up the Rhine-John Bull's summer resorts-
and you will find the scale of charges at the hotels-
supposing breakfast to be the meal-something like the
following:-For a German with a knapsack and a pipe,
half a franc; for a Frenchman with light-cloth boots,
primrose gloves, and glossy hat, one franc; for an Eng-
lishman with his wife, ten children, and a van-load of
luggage, two francs each, and one franc pour le garçon.
Now the regular fee for a guide to pass in safety from
Jerusalem to Jericho-a somewhat dangerous road--is
100 piastres; but a certain Jolin Bull, in his awkward
generosity, must needs give 200, so that ever since that
sum is demanded by the Arab sheik of every English
traveller, and unless he has previously learned that the

customary bucksheesh is only 100, he is sure to be
forced to pay it. But sometimes the freaks of John
Bull partake of the wanton and mischievous, as the
following examples will shew:-
A few years back I was travelling in a steamboat on
the Rhine, when I was suddenly accosted by a rather
rakish-looking young man.
'I think I have seen you before, sir,' said he.
Ah!
I recollect now it was at the Convent of Mount St
Bernard. You remember what a lovely night it was
when we were there, and how brightly the moon and
stars shone forth! Do you know what I did while
there ?'
'No.'
'Well then, I'll tell you. You remember the morgue,
the place where they keep the bodies of persons they
find buried in the snow?-and the tales those old monks
told us about the different skeletons?-although I don't
believe half the fellows said-they can draw the long-bow
so precious tight. Well, after supper, when you were
sitting snugly over the fire-how cold it was!-I stole
out of the convent, and went to the morgue, and got
into it by one of the air-holes in the wall, my object
being to carry away something as a souvenir. When
I began to look around me I must say I felt some-
what queer, for the moon was shining through the
various holes right into the building, and made the
skeletons look so comically white! They all seemed
to be on the full grin at me-one old fellow especially,
up in a corner: perhaps you remember him, for the
monk who shewed us the place told us some story
about him. Whenever I turned, there he was with
his diabolical grin. At last I could stand it no longer,
and struck at the fellow with this stick, which I had
with me at the time, and down he came. You should
have heard his old bones rattle! But what do you
think I did? Why I carried off his grinning skull as
a relic, and have got it now safe in my portmanteau :
that's what I call travelling to some purpose!'
At the eastern extremity of that portion of the city
of Valetta (Malta) known as Florian, stands a Capuchin
convent. In the crypt are preserved the bodies of
the deceased monks, placed upright in niches, and
dressed in the habit of the order. A party of English
sea-captains were shewn this crypt, when the guide
called their attention to a particular body, which he
told them was that of a superior; a man who, while
living, was noted for his great learning, piety, and
charity, and was therefore looked upon by his brethren
almost in the light of a saint. On hearing this, one
of the sailors, taking the opportunity of the guide's
back being turned, took out his clasp-knife, and cut
off the right-hand thumb. The mutilation was not
discovered at the time, and the fellow escaped punish-
ment. I know a person to whom he afterwards shewed
the thumb, glorying in the deed; but I am happy
to say he met with anything but the applause he
expected. The disfigured hand was pointed out to me
on my visit to the convent. Ladies are now excluded
except on certain days, and for this reason:-A party
of English ladies and gentlemen paid a visit to the
convent, and were, as usual, shewn into the crypt. One
of the gentlemen, no doubt thinking it would be a good
joke, pinned the gown of one of the ladies to the robe
of one of the mummies, and the consequence was, that
when she moved suddenly away, she pulled the body
out of the niche, and dashed it to pieces on the floor.
One evening, at a dinner-party at Cairo, the conver-
sation turned upon museums, when up started a young
English traveller, and boastingly said: 'Gentlemen,
I've travelled through Italy and Greece, and am
making a collection, but you'll never guess what it is,
so I may as well tell you. Why, it's a collection of
the noses of all the heathen gods and goddesses, saints
and sinners, I can lay my hands upon. I always carry
with me a hammer, and whenever I see a statue, and an
opportunity presents itself, I knock the nose off, and
then carefully label it. Now one of my principal
objects in coming to Egypt is to get the nose of a
certain statue,' which he named, but I have forgotten
what it was, 'and I mean to have it too.' His intention,
however, was happily foiled by a gentleman, a well-
known antiquary at Cairo, sending word to the Arabs
to cover over with sand the statue this modern Goth
intended to mutilate, and so putting the sapient nose-
collector on a false scent.
I fell in with a party of travellers in Syria who
required shelter for the night; so they knocked at
the door of an Arab farmer's house, and it not being
opened so soon as they considered desirable, one of the
party drew a pistol from his belt, and firing it, blew off
the lock: they then entered, turned the family out, and
coolly took possession for the night. They settled the
matter the next morning by paying about ten times
more than would have been necessary had they gone
the proper way to work.
The following circumstance took place about three
years ago. A Mr R, an English traveller, pitched
his tent for the night in one of the numerous villages
on the Lebanon. While in the full enjoyment of his
pipe, the children of the village kept peeping into the
tent to look at the strange Frank: this, it appears,
greatly annoyed our countryman, so that at last he drew
his pistol, and shot one of the little boys. As may be
supposed, the whole village was up in arms to avenge
this wanton outrage, and Mr R- would soon have
received the reward he so richly merited, had it not
been for the Sheik el Belled or village chief, who advised
taking him before the British consul at Beyrout. This
was accordingly done. It was proposed that he should
be sent to Malta, to take his trial for murder; but
the child not being dead, it was at last settled that he
should pay L.300 to the parents, and L.50 for the out-
rage committed on the village. Placing security in
the hands of the consul for the amount, he was allowed
to depart, and set out for Damascus the next day-on
the following day the child died. On his arrival at
Damascus he railed at the decision of the consul; but
on hearing of the death of his victim, and being told
that he had better hold his tongue, he beat a hasty
retreat from the Holy Land, never, I trust, to pollute
it again with his presence.
It is now to be hoped, that as travelling and inter-
course with foreign countries become more common,
John Bull will mend his manners, and see the folly of
his ways: perhaps the least culpable of all his acts is,
when he turns his steps homeward to recount to his
untravelled and wonder-stricken friends all the extra-
vagances of which he has been guilty.
CHINESE PORCELAIN-SEALS FOUND
IN IRELAND.
Or all the curious remains which have been found in
the sister - country, none are enveloped in greater
mystery than the porcelain-seals which have lately
come to light. The first public notice of them, we
believe, was in the year 1840, when Mr Huband Smith
of Dublin called the attention of the Irish Academy
to the fact, that about a dozen seals, bearing ancient
Chinese characters, had been found within the last few
years in various parts of Ireland, and in situations
which precluded the supposition that they were of
modern introduction; opening a wide field for conjec-
ture as to the time when they made their way into this
country. The matter was taken up by several zealous
antiquaries in Ulster, whose farther researches have
increased the number fourfold; and lest these remains
should come to be confounded with importations consé-
quent on our recently-established intercourse with the
Celestial Empire, a complete catalogue has been made
of them, the history of each has been investigated and

chronicled, and its present resting-place registered.
Not only have the most eminent Chinese scholars in
this country been consulted about them, but impres-
sions of the greater part have been transmitted to
China itself for explanation. The result of the whole
investigation was laid before the Literary Society of
Belfast on the 6th May 1850 by Edmund Getty,
Esq. and it embraces some curious and interesting
particulars.
Each of these seals consists of a perfect cube, with
the figure of a Chinese monkey sitting upon it by way
of handle; and they are all so exactly like each other
in size, shape, and general appearance, as to be undis-
tinguishable except by the inscriptions on the under
surface. The material is porcelain; and, from the
great degree of heat to which they must have been
subjected, and the vitrification which has in some
measure taken place in consequence, they are as inde-
structible by corrosion or other operation of time as the
glass and porcelain ornaments which are found in the
mummy-cases of Egypt. The inscriptions are in the
Chuentze or ancient-seal character of China, which,
though as old as the days of Confucius-five or six
centuries before the Christian era-is often used at the
present day on the seals both of public functionaries
and private individuals, in the same way that we
employ the black-letter of our Gothic ancestors for
fancy purposes.
These inscriptions seem to be as numerous and
varied as those on our own fancy-seals and wafers; and
they have often as little apparent connection with a
written correspondence. Such are Yih tsaon ting'
(A portico of straw'), alluding to the sheds erected on
the roads for the accommodation of travellers; 'Shan
kaon shwuy shang'('High mountains and long streams.')
Sometimes they are sentimental mottoes, and sometimes
they appear to be mere proper names, and difficult of
explanation. On a comparison of five sets of trans-
lations now before us, one of which is by the late
lamented Dr Gutzlaff, we select a few of the mottoes
which seem to be the least ambiguous, judging from
the unanimity of the translators.
writing. Tuy ke keih jin' ('Put one's self in another's
place'), refers to a Confucian aphorism which is equi-
valent to the Christian one-Do as you would be
done by.' 'Wei che sze yay' ('Men do not think of it'
virtue), is a quotation from the 'Sun yu' of Confucius.
And lastly, Tsae shwuy yih fang' (Must be in the
neighbourhood of the water'), is a quotation from a
Chinese ode, in which a man not seeing his friend
conjectures where he may be.
These curious seals, amounting to about fifty, have
been found at various times, and in localities very
distant from each other. The one registered as No. 7
was discovered about seventy years ago by a turf-
cutter in a bog in Queen's County; No. 5 was found
at no great depth near the town of Carlow, on the
site of an old road which led to the Roman Catholic
burying - ground, but which has been closed since the
year 1798; No. 12 was dug up about forty years ago in
taking out the roots of an old pear-tree in an orchard in
the County Down, and from the age of the tree it must
have lain there a long time before its discovery; No. 26,
now in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy, was
found in 1833 in a ploughed field near Borris-O'-Kane,
County Tipperary; No. 3 in the parish of Killyleagh,
County Down, in a piece of ground which was over-
grown with furze, and appeared never to have been
cultivated: it is in the Belfast Museum; No. 13 has
been in the possession of a private family in Dublin for
at least seventy or eighty years, but there is no record
of its previous history; No. 45 was found about the
year 1805 in a cave near the mouth of Cork Harbour;
and No. 50 about ten years ago, immediately outside
Cahir Castle. Some human bones were found with
this seal, but they mouldered to dust on exposure to
the atmosphere.

The interesting question is: How or when did these
seals find their way to Ireland? The specimens them-
selves furnish no clue to their antiquity; for their
substance is absolutely imperishable, while the cha-
racter,' says Sir J. F. Davis, is sufficiently ancient for
any assignable date within our reach.' When they
were first introduced to public notice, a correspondent
'Ying fung lung yue' (Singing in the breeze and of the Athenæum,' said to be a Chinese scholar, irre-
playing under the moon'), an allusion to people amusing verently declared them to be 'evidently a hoax'-

but they write a curse or ill-omen to him who shall Sir J. F. Davis, who quite agreed with them, that even
violate their secrecy. It is said that in ancient times were these seals like those recently brought from China

make it highly improbable that they would, if buried
for any considerable length of time, preserve in any
degree their original form.'
A diligent search has been made in the curiosity-
shops of London, and in other places where sailors would
be likely to dispose of articles brought from foreign
lands, but only one specimen could be found similar
to those under consideration; and the shopkeeper
being urged to say how he had obtained it, stated that
he had bought it from a person who told him that it
had been found in Ireland. Subsequent information
led to the belief that it had been one of four sold out
of a private collection in Dublin.
The antiquaries who have taken so much trouble
on this subject, fondly cling to the persuasion, though
they express it with great modesty, that these seals
may be vestiges of the ancient Phoenician commerce
with our western shores. There seems little doubt
that there was in early times an overland trade between
the Celestial Empire and the countries adjacent to
Phoenicia, and in communication with it. Vases
unquestionably Chinese have been discovered in the
tombs of Egypt; and Pliny, with other Roman authors,
mentions certain murrhine cups or vases, which appear
to have been identical with Chinese porcelain. They
were introduced at Rome by Pompey after the Mithri-
datic war, and became articles of luxury among the
wealthier Roman nobles, who gave enormous prices
for them, on account of their fragility, taken in
connection with the immense distance of the Eastern
country whence they were said to come. It is cer-
tainly strange, be it remarked, that the relics found in
Ireland are seals and not cups, perfume-bottles, coins,
medals, or any other usual article of commerce.
It is to be hoped that the intercourse now opened
with China may throw some light on this subject. It
can probably be ascertained whether such seals as we
have described are now found there; and if so, whether
they are considered to be of ancient or modern manu-
facture. Even if the latter prove to be the case, how-
ever, it would not materially weaken the presumption
of the antiquity of those now brought to light, consider-
ing that the Chinese preserve the customs of the re-
motest periods, as well as their antiquarian remains,
with a religious care and veneration unequalled among
any other people.
"
everything which tends to impress the reader with a
vague idea that sailors are a separate race of mortals,
with most fascinating characteristics-is skilfully dwelt
upon; but the stern, homely, matter-of-fact, monotonous
life they lead is carefully kept in the background, or
alluded to in a very slight and deceptive manner. Can
we wonder, therefore, that boys of ardent imaginations
are absorbingly attracted by such an idealised profes-
sion? So enthralling is the love of the sea thus gene-
rated, that a good authority declares that he has known
youths who could not hear the creaking of a block
used in hoisting sugar to the upper floor of a grocer's
warehouse, without their imaginations being fired with
vivid dreams of ships and the ocean! Once let a
stripling become impressed with a longing for the sea,
no matter how generated, and the very means you adopt
to check his diseased fancy will only strengthen and
confirm it. Yet his case is precisely analogous to that
of a youth falling passionately in love with a maiden
whom he has never seen!
We can give a case in point in which we were
personally concerned. About eight years ago, we
ourselves were guilty of writing a sea-novel, a copy of
which fell into the hands of a boy, a first-cousin of
ours. He told us that he had read it over and over till
he knew it by heart, and nothing would serve his turn
but he must go to sea. His parents were distressed,
and we had a long interview with him, and did our
utmost to disabuse his mind of the romantic notions
which our own book alone had created. All in vain!
He would believe his own wild impression from our
fiction rather than our sober, truthful viva-voce advice.
He went a short first voyage on liking, and on his
return frankly told us that had he known what a hard,
harsh life a sailor's really was, he would never have
quitted land. But,' said he, 'I shall be laughed at if
I give it up now! I am a sailor for life, and all through
that book of yours!' He was then regularly appren-
ticed to a merchantman, but the mate treated him so
cruelly that he deserted to a man-o'-war, and, if living,
he is probably yet in the navy.
The two great classes of boys who go to sea are
those who have imbibed romantic notions concerning
it, and long to realise them; and those who are sent by
their friends as a means to reform them of bad habits.
Of the two, the latter class generally make the best
sailors; the others are too much disgusted at the
reality, too heart-broken at the utter annihilation of all
their fine dreams, to take kindly and well to their
rough calling. There are of course numerous excep-
tions in both classes; and of the former, many cling to
the sea, and learn to become good sailors out of sheer
desperation and stubborn resolve to make the best of a
bad bargain, rather than acknowledge themselves to be
woefully deceived.
Let us not be misunderstood. We ourselves enthu-
siastically loved the sea when young, and we love it
yet, but in a very different degree. It is a noble pro-
fession, that of the wild waves' mastery, but it is
emphatically one of the hardest, worst paid, and most
THE ROMANCE' OF SEA-LIFE.
WE personally know something of the sea, of sailors,
and of their life both ashore and afloat, both in the
forecastle and the cabin, both abroad and at home.
We know also that there is a marvellously prevalent
notion among landsmen that a sailor's life is the most
romantic of all lives, and that he is himself a very
romantic personage individually. We know that the
mere name of 'sea,''ship,' or 'sailor' excites emotion
in the breasts of novel-reading lads, and adventurous
youths in general. There seems to be an inherent
witchery in the very idea of the glad waters of the
dark-blue sea;' but this has been stimulated a thousand-prosaic!
fold by the popular songs of Dibdin and others, por-
traying sailors in such colours that they cannot recog-
nise themselves, and also by certain modern fictions,
which, however admirable as works of art, convey
anything but a correct notion of the real work-a-day
life of the gallant but plain, honest fellows who man
England's wooden - walls. In the books in question,
everything which can throw a charm over the sea-
*We may perhaps except a few of Dibdin's best songs; but the
actual fact is, that the songs which are really sung on shipboard
are as different from Dibdin's as it is possible to conceive. The
songs which sailors love to sing are doggrel, without a spark of
imagination. It has been said that Dibdin's songs recruited the
navy in war-time more than a dozen pressgangs. Yes, but the
songs did not cause sailors to ship, but only landsmen.
Yes, young readers of Fenimore Cooper,
we say it is right-down prosaic; and we know what it
is to lay out on a yard in a hurricane. We say, more-
over, that sailors themselves are, with very few excep-
tions, the most prosaic and matter-of-fact among
mortals. You may sneer at this; but one week, one
day, nay, even one hour of actual sea-service would
perhaps convince you that we are speaking advisedly.
Let truth be spoken above all things. A sailor's life
brings him in occasional contact with sublime manifes-
tations of the Divine power, but he little regards them.
His duties absorb all his attention, and there is no
time for sight-seeing and reflection, nor is sentiment of
any kind allowed to be indulged in on shipboard. On
the other hand, he will for weeks and months lead the
dullest and most unexciting life conceivable. Day

after day the same monotonous round of commonplace
duties are exacted with iron discipline. Work, work,
nothing but work, and not a minute spent in idleness.
It is all very pleasant to you, young gentleman, to sit
with your feet on a parlour fender, and gloat over
picturesque and highly-wrought descriptions of nautical
manœuvres, but we can tell you that not one of these
is felt to be anything but ordinary work by those who
actually perform them. There is nothing very delightful
in the hourly act of running up and down ladders like a
bricklayer's labourer, and hauling rough ropes till your
back feels ready to break and your heart to burst;
there is nothing peculiarly elevating and chivalrous in
the act of picking oakum, and making spun-yarn and
sinnet-and sailors are steadily kept at these and
similar labours in the intervals between shifting sails;
nor is there any inexpressible charm in the act of
scraping and oiling masts and yards, and washing decks
and tarring rigging.
Now suppose, young friend, that your parents have
at length yielded to your frantic entreaties that you
may be a sailor, and that you are regularly apprenticed
to an East Indiaman. The dream of your life, the
cherished prayer of your heart, is fulfilled. You set
your foot on the snowy decks with thrilling feelings
-proud and glowing aspirations and anticipations.
The ship sails, and for a day or so you are too sick
to do any duty, and too much a piece of mere lumber
in everybody's way during the hurry of departure; so
you are unceremoniously kicked below to rough it out
as you may. On the morning of the second day you
find yourself included in the first-mate's watch, which
happens to be the morning-watch-4 A. M. to 8 A. M.-and
are called on deck. You stagger up, feeling very queer,
very weak, very miserable. It is a fine summer
morning, with a steady breeze, and the ship is calmly
gliding along on a taut-bowline. You have no heart
to look much about you, but you see that every soul
on deck is at work. You sit down on the booms, greatly
exhausted, and the next moment a rope's end is smartly
laid across your shoulders, and the mate, with an oath,
asks you whether you have shipped to sit for a figure-
head, and the sailors chuckle, and the ship-boys wink
and grin, and put out their tongues. You rub your
shoulders in amazement, and think of your poor mother
at home, and burst into tears. The mate calls you a
snivelling milksop, and sets you to scrape the tar off
a seam of the deck recently payed, with a mysterious
admonition that if you don't mind what you are about
you will receive a liberal allowance of 'beans and
bacon!' You don't know what beans and bacon
means on shipboard; but you do know that your soft
white hands are very sore with grasping the shaft of
the rough scraper, and very pitchy in a few minutes,
and you mentally think there is very little romance in
the operation. Four bells strike-6 A. M.-and the word
is given to rig the head-pumps, and wash down the
decks. The sailors roughly call you to bear a hand;
and you have to pump away, and to take off your shoes
and stockings, and paddle with naked feet among the
cold water surging over the decks. Then comes the
holy-stoning part; and you are set to haul about the
6 bibles-as sailors profanely call the large stones--
and to kneel and rub away with 'prayer-books-small
hand-stones-till you fancy it is just the sort of work
your mother's kitchenmaid is used to, and you are
thankful none of your friends see you engaged at it,
and you are very certain there isn't a bit of romance
in it. This lasts till eight bells, and you then go to
breakfast with what appetite you may.
Four hours later you are summoned on deck again;
and the sailors push and knock you about, and one
orders you to do this, and another to do that, and all
swear at you for your awkwardness and stupidity, and
you are perfectly bewildered and frightened, and a
picture of misery. The busy mate sees you; and
Hollo you, sir!' cries he, skulking again, are you?
I'll polish you! Take that bucket of slush, and lay
aloft and rub down the royal-mast. And mind what
you do, for my eye is on you!'
You have a bucket of tar and grease and a bunch of
oakum thrust into your clammy hands, and are hurried
aloft. How you ever get to the royal-masthead you
have no subsequent recollection. You are too dizzy to
know what you are about; but the mate, whom you
think is a demon, is nothing of the sort. He is only
doing his duty. You have shipped to become a sailor,
and he is beginning to make a sailor of you. He sends
an experienced ship-boy aloft to look after you, and
this youth digs his knuckles into your sides to make
you ascend, and tells you to fix your eyes above your
head instead of below your feet; and when you hesi-
tate to dip your delicate fist in the stinking slush, he
deliberately gives you a dab in the mouth with it, and
asks you who you think you are? You hardly know
yourself by this time who you are nor what you are;
but you feel in every bone of your body and every
tingling muscle that you have found no romance in a
sailor's life yet.
And, my young friend, what is more, you never will!
There is no romance in life at sea. You will find it
nothing but hard work-hourly drudgery. Every soul
on board a ship, from cabin-boy to captain, has duties
which fully occupy every minute of his time-hard
duties, stern duties, prosaic duties. Every private
feeling, consideration, and predilection, yields to them.
A sailor, no matter what his station, never indulges in
romantic fancies of any kind. His life and conversa-
tion, whether afloat or ashore, are as matter-of-fact as
those of a baker or tallow-chandler. He lives a life of
extreme hardship, toil, and privation; and the reason
he follows the sea all his days is very frequently
because three or four years of sea-life totally unfit him
for any other calling.
What we have thus briefly written is the unvarnished
truth, and if it induces any youth to pause ere he
rashly and unwittingly embraces the sea as a profes-
sion, owing to exaggerated and false notions of its
presumed romantic nature, we shall be glad; but if,
with his eyes open to a full consciousness and con-
viction that there is no romance in regular daily life
at sea, although there is plenty of all kinds of hard
work, he should still persist in slipping on the blue
jacket, why, we heartily say to him: God speed you!
you are the stuff to make a sailor!'
EFFECTS OF EDUCATION ON THE ROBIN.
The most remarkable instance I ever remember to
have met with of a young pupil not only imitating, but
far surpassing his tutor, was about nine years ago, in
Jermyn Street, Haymarket. At that period I revelled in
the undisturbed enjoyment of a large aviary, numbering
no fewer than 366 inhabitants, all first-rate songsters;
and my fame as an amateur had spread widely. Among
the multitude of my visitors was a gentleman, who in-
formed me that a friend of his was possessed of a most
wonderful bird, that he should much like me to see and
hear. I took the address, and went at an early day to
view the prodigy. On entering the house referred to, and
on presenting my card, I was at once ushered into the
drawing room. I there saw two cages-nightingale

green curtain drawn down over the front, concealing
the inmate. After a little discourse on the subject of
ornithology, my host asked me if I should like to hear
one of his nightingales sing. Of course I was all expecta-
tion. Placing me beneath the cage, and drawing up the
curtain before alluded to, the bird above, at a whistle
from his master, broke out in a succession of strains that
I never heard surpassed by any nightingale. They were
indeed surprisingly eloquent.
What a nightingale !'

ejaculated I. The rapid utterance of the bird, his perfect
abandon to the inspiration of his muse, and his indif-
ference to all around him, caused me to involuntarily
exclaim with Coleridge:
That strain again!
Full fain it would delay me.'
And so it did. I stood rivetted to the spot, knowing how
seldom nightingales in a cage so deported themselves.
After listening some time, and expressing my astonish-
ment at the long-repeated efforts of the performer-so
unusual, I asked to be allowed a sight of him. Per-
mission was granted; the curtain was raised, and I
saw before me-a robin! This bird had been brought up
under the nightingale from his very earliest infancy, and
not only equalled, but very far surpassed his master
in song.
Indeed he put him down and silenced him
altogether. This identical bird, I should add, was sold
a few weeks afterwards for nine guineas: he was worth
the money. In this case the robin retained no one single
note of his own whereby the finest ear could detect him;
and this paves the way to still more singular discoveries
hereafter. William Kidul in the Gardeners' Chronicle.
AN UGLY ENCOUNTER.
In a lately-published American work, entitled 'Forest
Life,' by J. S. Springer, the following anecdote is given
respecting an encounter in the northern woods with a
ferocious animal of the tiger kind, of which the natives
stand in great dread, from its uncompromising ferocity.
An individual named Smith, while travelling through the
forests, had the bad fortune to encounter one of these
creatures. He had nearly reached an encampment of
his companion lumberers, when the animal stood before
him. There was no chance for retreat, neither had he
any time for reflection on the best method of defence or
escape. As he had no arms or other weapons of defence,
the first impulse, in this truly fearful position, unfortu-
nately perhaps, was to spring into a small tree near by ;
but he had scarcely ascended his length when the despe-
rate creature, probably rendered still more fierce by the
promptings of hunger, sprang upon and seized him by the
heel. Smith, however, after having his foot badly bitten,
disengaged it from the shoe, which was firmly clinched
in the creature's teeth, and let him drop. The moment
he was disengaged, Smith sprang for a more secure
position, and the animal at the same time leaped to
another large tree, about ten feet distant, up which he
ascended to an elevation equal to that of his victim,
from which he threw himself upon him, firmly fixing
his teeth in the calf of his leg. Hanging suspended thus
until the flesh, insufficient to sustain the weight, gave
way, he dropped again to the ground, carrying a portion
of flesh in his mouth. Having greedily devoured this
morsel, he bounded again up the opposite tree, and from
thence upon Smith, in this manner renewing his attacks,
and tearing away the flesh in mouthfuls from his legs.
During this agonising operation, Smith contrived to cut a
limb from the tree, to which he managed to bind his jack-
knife, with which he could now assail his enemy at every
leap. He succeeded thus in wounding him so badly that
at length his attacks were discontinued, and he finally
disappeared in the dense forest. During the encounter,
Smith had exerted his voice to the utmost to alarm the
crew, who he hoped might be within hail. He was
heard, and in a short time several of the crew reached
the place, but not in time to save him from the dreadful
encounter. The sight was truly appalling. His garments
were not only rent from him, but the flesh literally torn
from his legs, exposing even the bone and sinews. It was
with the greatest difficulty he made the descent of the
tree. Exhausted through loss of blood, and overcome by
fright and exertion, he sank upon the ground and imme-
diately fainted; but the application of snow restored
him to consciousness. Preparing a litter from poles and
boughs, they conveyed him to the camp, washed and
dressed his wounds as well as circumstances would allow,
and, as soon as possible, removed him to the settlement,
where medical aid was secured. After a protracted period
of confinement, he gradually recovered from his wounds,
though still carrying terrible scars, and sustaining irre-
parable injury. Such desperate encounters are, however,
of rare occurrence, though collisions less sanguinary are
not unfrequent.

BEATRICE TO DANTE.
'Guardami ben. Ben son, ben son!'*
'REGARD me well; I am thy love-thy love;'
Thy blessing-thy delight-thy hope-thy peace:
Thy joy above all joys that break and cease
When their full waves in widest circlets move:
Thy bird of comfort-thine immortal dove,
Whom thou let'st forth out of thy grievèd breast
To flutter back and point a place of rest:
Thine angel who forgets her crown star-wove,
And comes to thee with folded woman-hands,
Pleading: Look on me well-thy love, that stands
Before thee; 'midst the Triune Light divine
Undazzled, still discerns thy human face,
And is more happy in this happy place-
That thou alone art hers, and she is thine.'
DANTE TO BEATRICE.
I SEE thee, gliding towards me with slow pace
Across the azure fields of Paradise,
Where thine each footstep makes a star arise:
So, from this heart's once void but infinite space
Each angel-touch of thine, by God's dear grace,
Struck out some fiery and eternal spark
To light the world, though all my heaven lay dark.
O Beatrice! cypresses inlace
My laurels; none have grown save tear-bedewed-
Heart-tears, that sunk into the earth unviewed,
And sprung up green to form this crown of bays.
Take it! At thy dear feet I lay my all,
What men my honours, virtues, glories, call:
I lived, loved, suffered, sung-for thy sole praise!
*Suggested by a marble figure of Beatrice, bearing this motto
on the pedestal.
BUMPER.
This name for a full glass of wine is said to be a
corruption of au bon père, which was the first toast
given when men sat down to drink in Catholic times, and
was either meant as a compliment to the priest of the
parish or the pope; but in some of the midland counties
anything large-a pear, plum, a fish, an apple-is called
a bumper. A large country girl is a bumping lass-a
large limbed, coarse rustic a bumpkin. Dr Johnson
deduces bumper from bump; others say it is a corruption
of bumbord-bombord, in Latin bombardun-a great gun,
and from thence applied to a large stoup or flagon or a
full glass. Thus in Henry VIII., act i. scene 7, the
second chamberlain says to the porters who had been
negligent in keeping out the mob:
You are lazzy knaves;
And here ye lie baiting of bunbord, when
Ye should do service :'
baiting of bumbord being a court-term for sitting and
drinking. Again in The Tempest, act ii. scene 2:
'Yond' some black cloud, yon' huge one
Looks like a foul bombord that would shed his liquor.'
and Mr Theobald explains it- a large vessel for holding
drink, as well as the piece of ordnance so called.'

THE MEISSENER HOCHLAND.
'Mein Herz ist im Hochland, mein Herz ist nicht hier,' &c.
German Translation of Burns.
WE had spent several days in the Hôtel de Saxe at
Dresden, had seen all the galleries of that wonderful
city, and heard the Opera company twice in one day-
namely, once in the morning at church, and a second
time in their own proper region across the way-and
were beginning to moralise, in melancholy fashion, on
the transitory nature of the company at a hotel, seeing
that we could scarcely distinguish at Mr Gerstkamp's
table-d'hôte a single face which had appeared there on
the day of our arrival-when a new guest entered,
with a lady on his arm, and I recognised an English
friend whom I had last seen within the Arctic Circle,
in the course of a hyperborean excursion, of which the
reader of these pages has probably perused some of the
details. Recognitions took place, with many mutual
felicitations on the happy fortune of a second rencontre,
so little to have been expected: our respective asso-
ciates were introduced; and after spending an hour
together, it was agreed that we should form a party
to visit the celebrated Meissener Hochland, or Saxon
Switzerland, as it is more generally, though more vul-
garly called by strangers. No sooner was the plan
agreed upon than we proceeded to its execution. We
set off that evening by the railway for Schandau, the
recognised centre of the district which we designed to
examine. The arrangement was the more suitable, as
we were all on our way to Bohemia, and Schandau
is twenty-three miles onward in that course. The
weather, too, promised remarkably well for such an
excursion.
Though it was only the 11th of August, and we
started on this journey at six o'clock, night overtook
us before we had advanced above half way, in conse-
quence of our being detained an hour by a break-down
of our engine. The accident was little to be lamented;
for when we reached the border of the Elbe and began
to advance into the mountainous country, the moon
shone out over the top of the opposite cliffs, and
afforded us some most beautiful snatches of the scenery
of that admirable river. It was not till near nine
o'clock that we stopped at the Schandau station-we in
full moonlight-Schandau lost in the deep shade of the
opposite feathery hills, except that its few lights
betrayed its presence-and the moony Elbe flowing
between. We were quickly deposited with our various
baggages in a boat, and found ourselves crossing the
resplendent river, smooth as a pond, but nevertheless
pressing on with such a force as costs the boatmen no
small exertion to counteract it. It was a romantic
PRICE 1d.
moment, such as occurs seldom, and remains long in
the memory; and we were almost sorry when called
upon to debark and choose a hotel. We were soon
established in an excellent inn called the Forst Haus
(Forest House), which raises its lofty bulk over the
river, having a garden in that direction, while on the
other side it adjoins to the street of the village. Here
we found many tourists, chiefly German-for the
Sächsisch-Böhmischen Schweiz, as they call it, is an
attractive wonder to the people of Northern Germany
in particular, a country remarkably deficient in roman-
tic scenery. I was pleased to find old married couples,
young married people, students, and others, thus bent
on holiday-making, as it gave the idea that political
fervours and fears did not entirely absorb the energies
of the people; neither had the late calamitous troubles
left the gloom which one would have expected. Of
this fact, however, I had had stronger demonstration
at Dresden, where I found an archery festival going on
for the entire week, with an enormous concourse of
strangers all bent on pleasure-seeking. A large field
near the city was daily covered with shows and booths
for the amusement and recreation of the assembled
multitude; and I am almost afraid to report what I
heard of the consumpt of beer upon the ground one hot
Sunday; but the memorandum of it in my note-book
certainly is-80,000 ems, an em being equal to seventy
English quarts. My informant had probably mistaken
eight for eighty; but even the lesser sum gives upwards
of half a million of bottles. Undoubtedly the capacity
of the Teutonic constitution for beer is something
prodigious.
From the glimpse which daylight gave me next
morning, and what I saw and learned afterwards, I
found this celebrated Hochland to be mainly composed
of a deposit of quadersandstein-the greensand of the
English geologists-the utmost height of which above
the Elbe may be about 1600 feet. Through this
deposit, however, the Elbe and its tributaries have cut
profound trenches or valleys; some other agent-
probably the sea at an early period, before it had
assumed its present limits-has made other excavations,
and left other prominences; and the unequal surface
thus produced has been partially clothed with wood, to
the immense increase of its beauty. Now there are
other elevated, tracts in which such operations cannot
at all be traced, or only to a small extent. What is it
which has made a particular tract of sandstone in Saxony
so romantic, and so attractive to holidayists? It is the
cubical fracture of the rock. The strata are disposed
almost horizontally; excavation and weathering leave
in such a rock vertical faces slightly rounded at the
angles. Behold, accordingly, a wonderful confusion of

abrupt cliffs and turret-like eminences scattered over
the country! This history of the scenery is proved by
the interspersed spaces which are occupied by granite
or any other Plutonic intrusion: these are all smoothed
down into the most perfect commonplace. But the
moment we pass out of their range, we find ourselves
amongst bold cliffs again. Hundreds pass over the
ground every summer day without dreaming of cause
for what they see. He who can penetrate that mystery
-and it is not difficult-has one enjoyment in his
holiday the more.
We started next morning in carriages along one of
the side-valleys, designing to give our first day to the
Kuhstall and Prebisch Thor, two of the most noted
curiosities of the district. A splendid sun shone over
us from a sky which one might have supposed could
never again be guilty of a cloud. It was a beautiful
narrow valley, with cliffs far up amongst the pine and
birch woods, and a silver streamlet at the bottom.
Some of the cliffs actually hang over the road, and
once in thirty years or so there is a fall of rock, to the
endangerment of passengers. One of the prominences
bears the descriptive name of the Lion's Head, from its
resemblance to the profile of that animal. Another,
bearing in its front face various perforations, has
obtained the name of the Death's Head. With such
matters our guides amused us till we came to what we
were told, with much importance of manner, was a
waterfall. We were now to discover that Saxon Swit-
zerland has no more been able to escape the intrusion
of the Cockney spirit than the Isle of Wight or the
Dargle. A peasant bustled out of a cottage, and
passing to the top of a rock of about thirty feet high,
drew up a sluice by which the water of a tiny rill had
hitherto been confined. We then had a little cascade
of about a minute's duration, for which we were ex-
pected to bestow a few groschen. The guides, and three
or four other peasants, all looked on with an appearance
of admiration most comforting to us, for we should
have otherwise feared that the cataract was not worth
the money. It would have been a shame, however, to
have been too critical at such a time and place.
After driving four or five miles, we came to a place
where we were told the carriage, serving us no longer,
must leave us and return. Our jocund party then
commenced a walk through rising, woody ground, and
in about half an hour we came to the celebrated
Kuhstall. It is one of the cliffy ridges of the district,
broken by deep chasms, and perforated at one place
by a lofty natural arch. The peasants having used it
as a retreat for their cattle during the Thirty Years'
War, is the cause of the name (Cows' Stall); but it is
believed to have been also a retreat for human beings,
and that for no inconsiderable time, and at another
period to have afforded shelter and refuge to robbers.
It had an indescribably startling effect to pass through
solemn woods, till, coming to the great arch, we saw
through it a brilliant sunlit scene of woody eminences
and distant arable slopes. Nor was it less curious to
pass by a natural stair up a narrow chink in the rock
till we attained a platform over the arch, and there
looked abroad upon a wider expanse of landscape.
Our romantic feelings were meanwhile played upon
by artificial grooves in the rock, by which doors had
formerly been applied for the fortification of these
eminences, and by having little caverns pointed out to
us as the dormitories of the garrison, and even a hollow
in the rock which had served as a baptismal font for
the children. The very romance of the place is, after
all, the death of it. Beneath the arch are a little
tavern and a shop for the sale of curiosities; and no
sooner does a party of tourists appear, than three young
women, who while away the time generally in knitting
or making lace, strike up a trio, accompanied by a
guitar, having no other thing to depend upon.' My
companions were much annoyed by this intrusion of
business into what ought to have been a scene of quiet
and solitary meditation; but I must confess to having
relished the songs of Fatherland with which the poor
girls caused the arch to resound. Nor was the draught
of Rhenish which a few groschen purchased quite to be
despised on so warm a forenoon. Another intrusion
into the naturalness of the scene was the crowd of
fameless names which had been cut into the face of
the rock overhead. I could not gaze without wonder
on so broad a demonstration of a passion which, as
tempting to such doings, never for a moment, so far
as I am conscious, entered my own breast.
6
We proceeded to descend one slope and ascend
another, still sunk amidst pine-woods, till we came to
the edge of a lofty cliff, and had a somewhat similar
view in another direction (the Lesser Winterberg.)
Here also had trade come, but only to traffic in fruit
and cream. Another long and toilsome sylvan walk,
in the course of which we ascended several hundred
feet, when suddenly, at a moment when I thought we
were approaching some dismal cave shagged with
horrid shades,' we turned an angle and found our-
selves in the paved courtyard of a nice hotel, with
parties of native tourists drinking beer under the shade
of a few trees. It was the hotel of the Great Winter-
berg, a house perched on the highest ground of the
district, and evidently a place of great resort. The
view from its belvedere on the top introduced us to all
the great eminences of the district, each of which has
for a final syllable in its name the word stein (meaning
stone or rock), as Circlestein, Cronstein, Pfaffenstein,
&c.: we saw the Elbe pursuing its glittering way
through what forms no small space in the map of
Europe, extending from Prague on the one hand to
Dresden on the other. While enjoying this wide
range of view, we had a tolerable lunch; after which,
again setting out, we had a longer walk, through woody
and rocky ground. Not altogether lonely, however,
for seldom did we attain any place at which a rest was
likely to be desirable, without a harp or a couple of
fiddles striking up for our regalement, or perhaps
a rustic mendicant posted up with his silent, but
scarcely less forcible appeal. I had been somewhat
surprised at the complete absence of street-begging in
Dresden, and was told that no such thing was there
practicable. Here, as if to make the traveller pay up
for the exemption in that city, it was impossible to
walk a quarter of a mile without being petitioned for
alms. The only consoling reflection was that the
beggars appeared not to be professional, but simply the
poor people of the district taking the opportunity of
somewhat alleviating the hardships of their lot.
The Prebisch Thor, which we at length reached,
proved to be a piece of ground of a most remarkable
character-a breast-work of cliffs, which seemed to
have been arrested half way towards the condition of a
range of needles. Three prominences start out from the
mountain, like great buttresses, and in one of these
is the natural arch or door from which the name is
derived. Seen from certain points, it is a wildering,
natural scene, which arrests attention by its very singu-
larity; not to speak of its rugged sublimity of peak,
and the beauty of the sylvan clothing of the lower
slopes. We thought ourselves at first in a perfect soli-
tude; but on advancing along one of the prominences,
we were soon undeceived. Turning an angle of rugged
rock, and looking down over what had seemed a
tremendous precipice--fit haunt only for the eagle and
the mountain-fox-what was our surprise to see, about
fifty feet down, a restaurant in full business, with
dozens of little holiday parties seated at tables in the
open air, making merry with tobacco, beer, and other
refreshments! On further acquaintance with the place,
we could not but feel amused by the strange mixture
of natural beauties with the familiar matters of com-
mon life. It was the Thor itself, the august arch left

here by nature, which had become the courtyard of a
hotel. Magnificent platforms of the cliff were in like
manner occupied by the outbuildings of the concern.
The grand chinks which seamed the front of the hill
were found to have been taken advantage of for the
construction of stairs, which, like the convergence of
the paths of glory in Gray's Elegy, led but to the
tavern. If we made our way round some apparently
sterile protuberance, thinking to get a more compre-
hensive view of the ocean of wood rolling beneath, we
were sure to light upon either an old woman engaged
in the honest calling of washing dishes, or a waiter
busy arranging empty bottles. Nor were little shops
for the sale of curiosities and guide-books forgotten.
In short, Cockneydom itself could not have more com-
pletely beset any show-place with its petty traps for
mortal appetite or its zeal for turning an honest
penny.
territory. Let me hurry on to the Bastei, which I had
reserved as the bonne bouche of the day, being by far
the finest example of that particular arrangement of
scenery which constitutes the wonders of the Saxon
Schweiz. After passing a considerable way along a
tame plateau, we suddenly come to the verge of a sand-
stone cliff, of four or five hundred feet in elevation, at
the base of which rolls the Elbe. The effect is so
startling as for some seconds to suspend the breathing
of the beholder, and send a thrill through his frame.
It is not a mere breast-work of cliff. On both hands
one sees a forest of pinnacles standing out as the
videttes of a winding range of precipices-a surprising
result of that cubical fracture peculiar to the rock. The
whole looks as if composed of some Titanic masonry.
Sometimes a thin wall of living rock connects the
advancing turret with the great irregular curtain of
precipice. Needle-eye apertures shine through some
of the prominences. Giant columns are capped and
feathered with shrubs which have found their way
where man cannot pass-adding beauty to what would
otherwise be only terrible. Man, however, has cut
passages and thrown perilous - looking bridges across
parts of the wilderness of natural fortification, and
thus enabled himself to approach spots where, through
the long stretch of time, no foot but that of the wild
bird had been. Here, too-for the truth must be told
Making our way down the valley to the small
town of Hirniskretschen, on the Elbe, we there, at
a reasonable hour in the afternoon, obtained places
in a steamer returning from Bohemia, and in a
very short time were safely landed at Schandau.
After dinner, tempted by the beautiful moonlight and
the delightful temperature, we wandered out to the
bank of the river, and there enjoyed some of those
soft and romantic reveries which come upon one in a
place which one does not know too familiarly-frag--he has contrived to furnish himself with the Cockney
ments of an ideal world composed solely of the
picturesque, the pure, and the happy. Some one said,
'What a nice place to spend a summer in!' But we
could not help fearing that a month, perhaps a week,
might be enough to undeceive us out of what we now
felt to be its chief charm. Affected, nevertheless, by
the gentle spirit of the hour, I was induced to get out
my flute, and play a few of the beautiful airs of a
certain land beyond the sea, sending along the moonlit
Elbe the same strains which I had once caused to float
over the fiords of Lapland. Here, however, it was
difficult to say whether the whimsical did not pre-
dominate over the romantic, for there certainly is
something intensely quaint in addressing national
music to ears so totally heteroclite to all its ordinary
associations.
From various circumstances not worthy of being
particularised, I had to enter upon my second day of
the Saxon Schweiz with the company of my daughter
only. Furnished with a good carriage and a guide, we
set out at eight in the morning, taking this time a
westerly direction. The morning air was pure and
brilliant as the diamond, and the narrow side-valley
into which we quickly plunged-called the Teufer
Grund (Deep Ground)- was even more beautiful
than that which formed the porch of our yesterday's
excursion. Not merely did the streamlet of the mea-
dow and the pines and birches of the mountain-sides
play well their several parts, but the very lichens,
fungi, and other antiquarian vegetation, as I think it
may be called, which clothed the rocks, conveyed a
rich feeling of beauty. In passing a tall rock which
started up by the way-side, with the date 1699 inscribed
upon it, we were told by our attendant that here a
dismal incident had taken place at that era. Two
young men, previously friends, became enamoured of
one damsel, the beauty of the district. Loving them
both equally, she had failed to repress the attentions of
either, and they consequently became deadly rivals.
They finally met at this spot, and fought in the savage
manner of their class, till both were mortally wounded.
I shall not attempt to detail our visits in the course of
this forenoon to the Brand, a tall cliff from which we
look down upon the Teufer Grund- Honenstein, an
old-fashioned village in the mountains-and Hochstein,
another cliffy eminence. Suffice it to say, they were
all remarkable objects, well worthy of the celebrity
they enjoy as the special attractions of this romantic
comforts of a restaurant and a brass band,' while
enjoying the sublimities of nature. He turns from
the pleasing agony of a look down the cliff to sip his
coffee or relume his cigar, and is interrupted in a
scientific meditation on the processes by which these
wonders of physical geography have been created, by a
cap held out for his contribution to the musicians.
A conspicuous object through the whole of this day's
excursion was Konigstein, one of the loftiest of the
isolated eminences formerly alluded to, and which has
been taken advantage of as the site of a fortress, said
to have hitherto resisted all efforts to reduce it. The
writer of Murray's Handbook tells us that it is fitted to
convey an excellent idea of the hill fortresses of India.
To a native of my own city who has not been much
from home, I would say, think of a fortress like Edin-
burgh Castle, only twice the size, on the top of a hill
as high as Arthur's Seat, and he will have some idea of
this grand stronghold of the Saxon monarchy, where
the jewels of the royal family are deposited in all times
of danger. The last attempt to reduce this castle was
made by Napoleon, who planted a battery against it
upon a hill about three miles off. The distance was
found to be too great to allow of the balls or bombs
having any effect. After a long detour, and ferrying
across the Elbe, we drove up a long paved way which
forms the approach to Konigstein, and by and by
reached a platform of ground under the walls of the
fortress, where we had to leave our carriage at a
humble gasthof. Let the reader imagine a lofty
sandstone cliff, pared down to make it vertical, and
surmounted by battlements and towers rising to the
height of about a hundred and sixty feet.
On arriving at the gate we found it jealously guarded,
and I had to send in my passport for the examination
of the commander before we could obtain admission.
During the long half-hour which we were kept waiting,
I observed that no person, man, woman, or child, passed
in or out without a scrupulous locking of the gate. At
length an order came for our admission; but here a
characteristic circumstance occurred. A young man,
who from his dress might have been a student, had
come up the sloping way beside our carriage, and
pleaded for permission to join us, in order to reduce
the expense of seeing the fortress-a fee of four shillings
being exacted from each party. His passport was now
returned to him, with a refusal of admission. I felt
sorry for the young man, and was curious to learn

the reason of his rejection. There was no other than
that he was an ouvrier. The poor fellow took the
matter a good deal more coolly than I-premonished,
perhaps, of the jealousy of his native government.
We found within a curious range of antique buildings
occupied by a considerable garrison, and, what surprised
me, a garden and grove of trees. The views from the
battlements were superb. The well we found to be the
principal curiosity; and it certainly is of no common
character. It penetrates the living rock to the depth
of above 600 feet, of which sixty are usually occupied
by water. When our attendant poured in a tankardful
of the element, its swoofing noise in descending was
very curious, and I found that nine seconds elapsed
before we heard it strike the surface. A man then took
a mirror, and ascending to an elevated point amidst
the machinery over the well, held it in a particular
manner with relation to the sun, which poured in its
rays at one of the windows. It was some time before
I understood the object: it was explained when our
guide, drawing us to the brink of the well, desired us
to look down. We then, to our surprise, beheld the
surface of the water 600 feet below as clearly as if it
had not been twenty-the reflection of the sun from
the mirror having penetrated the profound depth, and
given the abyss the lucidity of day. I have rarely seen
so striking an effect produced by means so simple.
Having thus completed the usual round of the
wonders of the Saxon Schweiz, we had nothing to do
but drive home in the cool of the evening, and talk
over the incidents of the day with our friends in the
hotel. We next morning set out by the railway for
Prague, unanimously acknowledging that the pleasant
hotel of Schandau, and the beauties of the Hochland
and of the noble Elbe, had rendered the two preceding
days the most agreeable that had yet occurred in the
course of our tour.
THE POINT OF HONOUR.
ONE evening in the autumn of the year 1842, seven
persons, including myself, were sitting and chatting in
a state of hilarious gaiety in front of Senor Arguellas'
country-house, a mile or so out of Santiago de Cuba, in
the Eastern Intendencia of the Queen of the Antilles,
and once its chief capital, when an incident occurred
that as effectually put an extinguisher upon the noisy
mirth as if a bomb-shell had suddenly exploded at our
feet. But first a brief account of those seven persons,
and the cause of their being so assembled, will be
necessary.
Three were American merchants-Southerners and
smart traders, extensively connected with the commerce
of the Colombian Archipelago, and designing to sail on
the morrow, wind and weather permitting, in the bark
Neptune-Starkey, master and part owner-for Morant
Bay, Jamaica; one was a lieutenant in the Spanish
artillery, and nephew of our host; another was a M.
Dupont, a young and rich creole, of mingled French
and Spanish parentage, and the reputed suitor for the
hand of Donna Antonia-the daughter and sole heiress
of Senor Arguellas, and withal a graceful and charming
maiden of eighteen-a ripe age in that precocious clime;
the sixth guest was Captain Starkey of the Neptune, a
gentlemanly, fine - looking English seaman of about
thirty years of age; the seventh and last was myself,
at that time a mere youngster, and but just recovered
from a severe fit of sickness which a twelvemonth pre-
viously had necessitated my removal from Jamaica to
the much more temperate and equable climate of Cuba,
albeit the two islands are only distant about five degrees
from each other. I was also one of Captain Starkey's
passengers, and so was Senor Arguellas, who had
business to wind up in Kingston. He was to be
accompanied by Senora Arguellas, Antonia, the young
lieutenant, and M. Dupont. The Neptune had brought
a cargo of sundries, consisting of hardware, cottons,
etcetera, to Cuba, and was returning about half-laden
with goods. Amongst these, belonging to the American
merchants, was a number of barrels of gunpowder that
had proved unsaleable in Cuba, and which, it was
thought, might find a satisfactory market in Jamaica.
There was excellent cabin-accommodation on board
Captain Starkey's vessel, and as the weather was fine,
and the passage promised to be a brief as well as
pleasant one-the wind having shifted to the north-
west, with the intention it seemed of remaining there
for some time-we were all, as I have stated, in exceed-
ingly good-humour, and discussing the intended trip,
Cuban, American, and European politics, the compara-
tive merits of French and Spanish wines, and Havannah
and Alabama cigars, with infinite glee and gusto.
The evening, too, was deliciously bright and clear.
The breeze, pronounced by Captain Starkey to be
rising to a five or six knot one at sea, only sufficiently
stirred the rich and odorous vegetation of the valleys,
stretching far away beneath us, gently to fan the
heated faces of the party with its grateful perfume, and
slightly ripple the winding rivers, rivulets rather, which
everywhere intersect and irrigate the island, and which
were now glittering with the myriad splendours of
the intensely - lustrous stars that diadem a Cuban
night. Nearly all the guests had drunk very freely
of wine, too much so, indeed; but the talk, in French,
which all could speak tolerably, did not profane the
calm glory of the scene, till some time after Senora
Arguellas and her daughter had left us. The senor, I
should state, was still detained in town by business
which it was necessary he should dispose of previous
to embarking for Jamaica.
'Do not go away,' said Senora Arguellas, addressing
Captain Starkey, as she rose from her seat, 'till I
see you again. When you are at leisure, ring the son-
nette on the table and a servant will inform me. I
wish to speak further with you relative to the cabin
arrangements.'
Captain Starkey bowed. I had never, I thought,
scen Antonia smile so sweetly; and the two ladies left
us. I do not precisely remember how it came about,
or what first led to it, but it was not very long before
we were all conscious that the conversation had assumed
a disagreeable tone. It struck me that possibly M.
Dupont did not like the expression of Antonia's face as
she courtesied to Captain Starkey. The after-unplea-
santness did not however arise ostensibly from that
take several free-coloured families to Jamaica, where
cause. The commander of the Neptune had agreed to
the services of the men, who were reputed to be expert
at sugar-cultivation, had been engaged at much higher
wages than could be obtained in Cuba. The American
gentlemen had previously expressed disapprobation of
this arrangement, and now began to be very liberal
indeed with their taunts and sneers relative to Captain
Starkey's negro principles,' as they pleasantly termed
of coloured people to their own souls and bodies. This,
that gentleman's very temperate vindication of the right
however, would, I think, have passed off harmlessly, had
it not been that the captain happened to mention, very
imprudently, that he had once served as a midshipman
on board the English slave-squadron. This fanned
M. Dupont's smouldering ill-humour into a flame, and
I gathered from his confused maledictions that he had
suffered in property from the exertions of that force.
The storm of angry words raged fiercely. The motives
of the English for interfering with the slave-traffic were
denounced with contemptuous bitterness on the one
side, and as warmly and angrily defended on the other.
Finally-the fact is, they were both flustered with wine
and passion, and scarcely knew what they said or did—

M. Dupont applied an epithet to the Queen of England,
which instantly brought a glass of wine full in his face
from the hand of Captain Starkey. They were all in
an instant on their feet, and apparently sobered, or
nearly so, by the unfortunate issue of the wordy
tumult.
Captain Starkey was the first to speak. His flushed
and angry features paled suddenly to an almost deathly
white, and he stammered out: 'I beg your pardon,
M. Dupont. It was wrong-very wrong in me to do
so, though not inexcusable."
"Pardon! Mille tonnerres!' shouted Dupont, who
was capering about in an ecstasy of rage, and wiping
his face with his handkerchief. 'Yes, a bullet through
your head shall pardon you-nothing less!'
Indeed, according to the then notions of Cuban
society, no other alternative save the duello appeared
possible. Lieutenant Arguellas hurried at once into
the house, and speedily returned with a case of pistols.
'Let us proceed,' he said in a quick whisper, to the
grove yonder; we shall be there free from interruption.'
He took Dupont's arm, and both turned to move off.
As they did so, Mr Desmond, the elder of the American
gentlemen, stepped towards Captain Starkey, who
with recovered calmness, and with his arms folded, was
standing by the table, and said: 'I am not entirely,
my good sir, a stranger to these affairs, and if I can
be of service I shall'.
way into the house, leaving the rest of her visitors, as
the French say, plantés là.
Ten minutes afterwards we were informed that
Captain Starkey had left the house, after impressing
upon Senora Arguellas that the Neptune would sail the
next morning precisely at nine o'clock. A renewed
torrent of rage, contempt, and scorn broke forth at
this announcement, and a duel at one time seemed
inevitable between Lieutenant Arguellas and Mr
Desmond, the last-named gentleman manifesting great
anxiety to shoot somebody or other in vindication of
his Anglo-Saxon lineage. This, however, was over-
ruled, and the party broke up in angry disorder.
We were all on board by the appointed time on the
following morning. Captain Starkey received us with
civil indifference, and I noticed that the elaborate sneers
which sat upon the countenances of Dupont and the
lieutenant did not appear in the slightest degree to
ruffle or affect him; but the averted eye and scornful
air of Donna Antonia as she passed with Senora Ar-
guellas towards the cabin, drawing her mantilla tightly
round her as she swept by, as if-so I perhaps wrong-
fully interpreted the action-it would be soiled by
contact with a poltroon, visibly touched him—only, how-
ever, for a few brief moments. The expression of pain
quickly vanished, and his countenance was as cold and
stern as before. There was, albeit, it was soon found,
a limit to this, it seemed, contemptuous forbearance.
Thank you, Mr Desmond,' replied the English Dupont, approaching him, gave his thought audible
captain; but I shall not require your assistance. expression, exclaiming, loud enough for several of the
Lieutenant Arguellas, you may as well remain. I am crew to hear, and looking steadily in the captain's face:
no duellist, and shall not fight M. Dupont.'
'Lâche!' He would have turned away, but was arrested
'What does he say?' exclaimed the lieutenant, gazing by a gripe of steel. Ecoutez, monsieur,' said Captain
with stupid bewilderment round the circle. 'Not Starkey: 'individually, I hold for nothing whatever you
fight!'
may say; but I am captain and king in this ship, and
I will permit no one to beard me before the crew, and
thereby lessen my authority over them. Do you
presume again to do so, and I will put you in solitary
confinement, perhaps in irons, till we arrive at Jamaica.'
He then threw off his startled auditor, and walked
forwards. The passengers, coloured as well as white,
were all on board; the anchor, already apeak, was
brought home; the bows of the ship fell slowly off, and
we were in a few moments running before the wind,
though but a faint one, for Point Morant.
The Anglo-Saxon blood, I saw, flushed as hotly in
the veins of the Americans as it did in mine at this
exhibition of the white feather by one of our race.
'Not fight, Captain Starkey!' said Mr Desmond with
grave earnestness after a painful pause: 'you whose
name is in the list of the British royal navy, say this!
You must be jesting!'
'I am perfectly serious-I am opposed to duelling
upon principle.'
'A coward, upon principle!' fairly screamed Dupont,
with mocking fury, and at the same time shaking his
clenched fist at the Englishman.
The degrading epithet stung like a serpent. A gleam
of fierce passion broke out of Captain Starkey's dark
eyes, and he made a step towards Dupont, but reso-
lutely checked himself.
'Well, it must be borne! I was wrong to offer you
personal violence, although your impertinence certainly
deserved rebuke. Still, I repeat I will not fight with
you.'
'But you shall give my friend satisfaction!' exclaimed
Lieutenant Arguellas, who was as much excited as
Dupont; or by Heaven I will post you as a dastard
not only throughout this island but Jamaica !'
Captain Starkey for all answer to this menace coolly
rang the sonnette, and desired the slave who answered
it to inform Senora Arguellas that he was about to
leave, and wished to see her.
'The brave Englishman is about to place himself
under the protection of your aunt's petticoats, Al-
phonso!' shouted Dupont with triumphant mockery.
'I almost doubt whether Mr Starkey is an English-
man,' exclaimed Mr Desmond, who, as well as his two
friends, was getting pretty much incensed; but, at all
events, as my father and mother were born and raised in
the old country, if you presume to insinuate that'-
Senora Arguellas at this moment approached, and
the irate American with some difficulty restrained
himself. The lady appeared surprised at the strange
aspect of the company she had so lately left. She,
however, at the request of the captain, instantly led the

No one could be many hours on board the Neptune
without being fully satisfied that, however deficient
in duelling courage her captain might be, he was a
thorough seaman, and that his crew-about a dozen of
as fine fellows as I have ever seen-were under the
most perfect discipline and command. The service of
the vessel was carried on as noiselessly and regularly
as on board a ship of war; and a sense of confidence,
that should a tempest or other sea-peril overtake us,
every reliance might be placed in the professional skill
and energy of Captain Starkey, was soon openly or
tacitly acknowledged by all on board. The weather
throughout happily continued fine, but the wind was
light and variable, so that for several days after we
had sighted the blue mountains of Jamaica, we scarcely
appeared sensibly to diminish the distance between
them and us. At last the breeze again blew steadily
from the north-west, and we gradually neared Point
Morant. We passed it, and opened up the bay at
about two o'clock in the morning, when the voyage
might be said to be over. This was a great relief to
the cabin-passengers-far beyond the ordinary pleasure
to land-folk of escaping from the tedium of confinement
on shipboard. There was a constraint in the behaviour
of everybody that was exceedingly unpleasant. The
captain presided at table with freezing civility; the
conversation, if such it could be called, was usually
restricted to monosyllables; and we were all very
heartily glad that we had eaten our last dinner in the
Neptune. When we doubled Point Morant, all the
passengers except myself were in bed, and a quarter

all knew there was a large quantity of gunpowder on
board. The instant the boats touched the starboard
side of the bark, the men, white as well as coloured,
forced their way with frenzied eagerness before the
women and children-careless, apparently, whom they
sacrificed so that they might themselves leap to the
shelter of the boats from the fiery volcano raging beneath
their feet. Captain Starkey, aided by the four athletic
seamen he had selected for the duty, hurled them
fiercely back. 'Back, back!' he shouted. We must
have funeral order here-first the women and children,
next the old men. Hand Senora Arguellas along; next
the young lady her daughter: quick!'
•
As Donna Antonia, more dead than alive, was about
to be lifted into the boat, a gush of flame burst up
through the main hatchway with the roar of an explo-
sion; a tumultuous cry burst from the frenzied pas-
sengers, and they jostled each other with frightful
violence in their efforts to reach the gangway. Dupont
forced his way through the lane of seamen with the
energy of a madman, and pressed so suddenly upon
Antonia that, but for the utmost exertion of the
captain's herculean strength, she must have been
precipitated into the water.
of an hour afterwards Captain Starkey went below,
and was soon busy, I understood, with papers in his
cabin. For my part I was too excited for sleep, and I
continued to pace the deck fore and aft with Hawkins,
the first-mate, whose watch it was, eagerly observant
of the lights on the well-known shore, that I had left
so many months before with but faint hopes of ever
seeing it again. As I thus gazed landward, a bright
gleam, as of crimson moonlight, shot across the dark
sea, and turning quickly round, I saw that it was
caused by a tall jet of flame shooting up from the main
hatchway, which two seamen, for some purpose or
other, had at the moment partially opened. In my
still weak state, the terror of the sight-for the recol-
lection of the barrels of powder on board flashed
instantly across my mind-for several moments com-
pletely stunned me, and but that I caught instinctively
at the rattlings, I should have fallen prostrate on the
deck. A wild outcry of Fire! fire!'- the most
fearful cry that can be heard at sea mingled
with and heightened the dizzy ringing in my brain,
and I was barely sufficiently conscious to discern,
amidst the runnings to and fro, and the incoherent
exclamations of the crew, the sinewy, athletic figure of
the captain leap up, as it were, from the companion- 'Back, unmanly dastard! back, dog!' roared Captain

fate must depend upon his judgment and vigour, that
not a word was spoken, nor a finger, I think, moved,
till he reappeared, already scorched and blackened
with the fire, and dragging up what seemed a dead
body in his arms. He threw his burden on the deck,
and passing swiftly to where Hawkins stood, said in a
low, hurried whisper, but audible to me: 'Run down
and rouse the passengers, and bring my pistols from
the cabin-locker. Quick! Eternity hangs on the loss
of a moment.' Then turning to the startled but atten-
tive seamen, he said in a rapid but firm voice: 'You
well know, men, that I would not on any occasion or
for any motive deceive you. Listen, then, attentively.
Yon drunken brute-he is Lieutenant Arguellas' ser-
vant has fired with his candle the spirits he was
stealing, and the hold is a mass of fire which it is
useless to waste one precious moment in attempting to
extinguish.'
A cry of rage and terror burst from the crew, and
they sprang impulsively towards the boats, but the
captain's authoritative voice at once arrested their
steps. 'Hear me out, will you? Hurry and con-
fusion will destroy us all, but with courage and steadi-
ness every soul on board may be saved before the
flames can reach the powder. And remember,' he
added, as he took his pistols from Hawkins and cocked
one of them, 'that I will send a bullet after any man
who disobeys me, and I seldom miss my aim. Now,
then, to your work-steadily, and with a will!'
It was marvellous to observe the influence his bold,
confident, and commanding bearing and words had
upon the men. The panic-terror that had seized them
gave place to energetic resolution, and in an incredibly
short space of time the boats were in the water. Well
done, my fine fellows! There is plenty of time, I
again repeat. Four of you-and he named them-
remain with me. Three others jump into each of the
large boats, two into the small one, and bring them
round to the landward side of the ship. A rush would
swamp the boats, and we shall be able to keep only one
gangway clear.'
The passengers were by this time rushing upon deck
half-clad, and in a state of the wildest terror, for they
'Ay, ay, sir!' was the prompt mechanical response.
This terrible menace instantly restored order; the
coloured women and children were next embarked, and
the boat appeared full.
'Pull off,' was the order: 'you are deep enough for
safety.'
A cry, faint as the wail of a child, arose in the boat.
It was heard and understood.
'Stay one moment; pass along Senor Arguellas.
Now, then, off with you, and be smart!'
The next boat was quickly loaded; the coloured lads
and men, all but one, and the three Americans, went in
her.
'You are a noble fellow,' said Mr Desmond, pausing
an instant, and catching at the captain's hand; and I
was but a fool to'
'Pass on,' was the reply: there is no time to bandy
compliments.'
The order to shove off had passed the captain's lips
when his glance chanced to light upon me, as I leaned,
dumb with terror, just behind him against the vessel's
bulwarks.
'Hold on a moment!' he cried. Here is a youngster
whose weight will not hurt you;' and he fairly lifted
me over, and dropped me gently into the boat, whisper-
ing as he did so: 'Remember me, Ned, to thy father
and mother should I not see them again.'
There was now only the small boat, capable of
safely containing but eight persons, and how, it was
whispered amongst us-how, in addition to the two
seamen already in her, can she take off Lieutenant
Arguellas, M. Dupont, the remaining coloured man,
the four seamen, and Captain Starkey? They were,
however, all speedily embarked except the captain.
'Can she bear another?' he asked, and although his
voice was firm as ever, his countenance, I noticed, was
ashy pale, yet full as ever of unswerving resolution.
'We must, and will, sir, since it's you; but we are
dangerously overcrowded now, especially with yon ugly
customers swimming round us.'
'Stay one moment; I cannot quit the ship whilst
there's a living soul on board.' He stepped hastily
forward, and presently reappeared at the gangway with

the still senseless body of the lieutenant's servant in his
arms, and dropped it over the side into the boat. There
was a cry of indignation, but it was of no avail. The
boat's rope the next instant was cast into the water.
'Now pull for your lives!' The oars, from the instinct
of self-preservation, instantly fell into the water, and the
boat sprang off. Captain Starkey, now that all except
himself were clear of the burning ship, gazed eagerly
with eyes shaded with his hand in the direction of the
shore. Presently he hailed the headmost boat. We
must have been seen from the shore long ago, and
pilot-boats ought to be coming out, though I don't see
any. If you meet one, bid him be smart: there may
be a chance yet.' All this scene, this long agony,
which has taken me so many words to depict very im-
perfectly from my own recollection, and those of others,
only lasted, I was afterwards assured by Mr Desmond,
eight minutes from the embarkation of Senora Arguel-
las till the last boat left the ill-fated Neptune.
Never shall I forget the frightful sublimity of the
spectacle presented by that flaming ship, the sole object,
save ourselves, discernible amidst the vast and heaving
darkness, if I may use the term, of the night and
ocean, coupled as it was with the dreadful thought that
the heroic man to whose firmness and presence of mind
we all owed our safety was inevitably doomed to perish.
We had not rowed more than a couple of hundred
yards when the flames, leaping up everywhere through
the deck, reached the rigging and the few sails set,
presenting a complete outline of the bark and her
tracery of masts and yards drawn in lines of fire!
Captain Starkey, not to throw away the chance he
spoke of, had gone out to the end of the bowsprit,
having first let the jib and foresail go by the run, and
was for a brief space safe from the flames; but what
was this but a prolongation of the bitterness of death?
The boats continued to increase the distance be-
tween them and the blazing ship, amidst a dead silence
broken only by the measured dip of the oars; and
many an eye was turned with intense anxiety shore-
ward with the hope of descrying the expected pilot.
At length a distinct hail-and I felt my heart stop
beating at the sound was heard ahead, lustily
responded to by the seamen's throats, and presently
afterwards a swiftly-propelled pilot-boat shot out of
the thick darkness ahead, almost immediately followed
by another.
"What ship is that?' cried a man standing in the
bows of the first boat.
"The Neptune, and that is Captain Starkey on the
bowsprit !'
I sprang eagerly to my feet, and with all the force I
could exert, shouted: A hundred pounds for the
first boat that reaches the ship!'
'That's young Mr Mainwaring's face and voice!'
exclaimed the foremost pilot. 'Hurra, then, for the
prize!' and away both sped with eager vigour, but
unaware certainly of the peril of the task. In a
minute or so another shore-boat came up, but after
asking a few questions, and seeing how matters stood,
remained, and lightened us of a portion of our living
cargoes. We were all three too deep in the water, the
small boat perilously so.
Great God! the terrible suspense we all felt whilst
this was going forward. I can scarcely bear, even now,
to think about it. I shut my eyes, and listened with
breathless, palpitating_excitement for the explosion
that should end all. It came !—at least I thought it
did, and I sprang convulsively to my feet. So sensi-
tive was my brain, partly no doubt from recent sick-
ness as well as fright, that I had mistaken the sudden
shout of the boats' crews for the dreaded catastrophe.
The bowsprit, from the end of which a rope was
dangling, was empty! and both pilots, made aware
doubtless of the danger, were pulling with the eager-
ness of fear from the ship. The cheering among us was
renewed again and again, during which I continued to
gaze with arrested breath and fascinated stare at the
flaming vessel and fleeing pilot-boats. Suddenly a
pyramid of flame shot up from the hold of the ship,
followed by a deafening roar. I fell, or was knocked
down, I know not which; the boat rocked as if caught
in a fierce eddy; next came the hiss and splash of
numerous heavy bodies falling from a great height into
the water; and then the blinding glare and stunning
uproar were succeeded by a soundless silence and a
thick darkness, in which no man could discern his
neighbour. The stillness was broken by a loud, cheer-
ful hail from one of the pilot-boats: we recognised the
voice, and the simultaneous and ringing shout which
burst from us assured the gallant seaman of our own
safety, and how exultingly we all rejoiced in his. Half
an hour afterwards we were safely landed; and as the
ship and cargo had been specially insured, the only
ultimate evil result of this fearful passage in the lives
of the passengers and crew of the Neptune was a heavy
loss to the underwriters.
A piece of plate, at the suggestion of Mr Desmond
and his friends, was subscribed for and presented to
Captain Starkey at a public dinner given at Kingston
in his honour-a circumstance that many there will
remember. In his speech on returning thanks for the
compliment paid him, he explained his motive for
resolutely declining to fight a duel with M. Dupont,
half-a-dozen versions of which had got into the news-
papers. 'I was very early left an orphan,' he said,
and was very tenderly reared by a maternal aunt,
Mrs
6
(He mentioned a name with which hun-
dreds of newspaper readers in England must be still
familiar.) Her husband-as many here may be aware
fell in a duel in the second month of wedlock. My
aunt continued to live dejectedly on till I had
passed my nineteenth year; and so vivid an impression
did the patient sorrow of her life make on me-so
thoroughly did I learn to loathe and detest the bar-
barous practice that consigned her to a premature
grave, that it scarcely required the solemn promise she
obtained from me, as the last sigh trembled on her lips,
to make me resolve never, under any circumstances,
to fight a duel. As to my behaviour during the unfor-
tunate conflagration of the Neptune, which my friend
Mr Desmond has spoken of so flatteringly, I can only
say that I did no more than my simple duty in the
matter. Both he and I belong to a maritime race, one
of whose most peremptory maxims it is that the
captain must be the last man to quit or give up his
ship. Besides, I must have been the veriest dastard
alive to have quailed in the presence of-of-that is,
in the presence of-circumstances which-in point of
fact that is'- Here Captain Starkey blushed and
boggled sadly: he was evidently no orator; but whether
it was the sly significance of Senor Arguellas' counte-
nance, which just then happened to be turned towards
him, or the glance he threw at the gallery where Senora
Arguellas' grave placidity and Donna Antonia's bright
eyes and blushing cheeks encountered him, that so
completely put him out, I cannot say; but he continued
to stammer painfully, although the company cheered
and laughed with great vehemence and uncommon
good-humour, in order to give him time. He could
not recover himself; and after floundering about
through a few more unintelligible sentences sat down,
evidently very hot and uncomfortable, though amidst
a little hurricane of hearty cheers and hilarious
laughter.
I have but a few more words to say. Captain
Starkey has been long settled at the Havannah; and
Donna Antonia has been just as long Mrs Starkey.
Three little Starkeys have to my knowledge already
come to town, and the captain is altogether a rich and
prosperous man; but though apparently permanently
domiciled in a foreign country, he is, I am quite satisfied,

as true an Englishman, and as loyal a subject of Queen

THE MAGNETOSCOPE.
A GENTLEMAN, Mr Rutter of Black Rock, Brighton,
has recently invented a magnetoscope of such extreme
delicacy, that it is capable of indicating plainly to the
sight the existence of magnetic currents which would
appear to be constantly traversing the human frame,
and the various modifications of them which are
produced by circumstances apparently of a totally
insignificant character-such even as contact with the
dead objects and living people around us.
The invention of the instrument is undoubtedly Mr
Rutter's, so far as it is an invention at all. However,
many of the phenomena produced by the apparatus,
and the principle of the arrangement, were introduced
to the notice of the English public several months ago
by Dr Mayo. No doubt many who read his work thought
too contemptuously of the apparently fabulous pheno-
mena there said to be producible, to take the trouble
of putting the matter to the test of experiment, even
though nothing was required, if I remember right, than
to string a gold ring on a silken thread, let it hang
loosely and freely from the human hand, and watch the
results. In this form, however, it was a mere toy.
Mr Rutter has made of it a philosophical instrument.
The following account is drawn up from notes taken
at a lecture on the instrument given in London by Dr
Madden of Brighton.*
1. From a stand fixed firmly to the table there rises
perpendicularly a rod of wood, say eighteen or twenty
inches high, having a brass knob on the top. From
the knob projects at right angles with the upright a
brass arm, say nine inches long, tapering to a fine end.
2. A fine silken filament is attached to one end of a
small spindle-shaped piece of sealing-wax like a fisher-
man's float-but the shape is not material. This is
hung from the extremity of the brass arm; and the
line being merely a raw thread taken from the cocoon,
there is no twist or tendency to turn in it, but the
plumbob hangs free to vibrate or circulate, or adopt
any motion in obedience to the infinitesimal influences
which are to act upon it.
Immediately underneath the centre of the bob is a
small circular wooden plate, say four inches in diameter,
so made as to be fixed in a horizontal position, higher
or lower-that is, nearer to or farther from the lower
point of the bob. On this is placed a glass dish, rather
less than the tablet it rests on, and about as deep as
the bob is long. The tablet is then moved upwards
until the lower end of the bob almost touches the centre
of the glass dish. The bob, thus hanging down into
the dish, is protected from the accidental movements
of the surrounding air. If thought desirable, however,
the whole line and bob can be surrounded with a glass
shade, such as are placed over artificial flowers or small

as likely to be read by many with interest, we do not profess to
vouch for all its statements.-ED.
statuary, having a hole in the top for the string to pass
through.
The apparatus being thus prepared, and the sealing-
wax bob hanging dead from the brass arm, and all parts
at rest, the operator placed the finger and thumb of
his right hand upon the brass knob, and almost without
any perceptible interval the bob was evidently moved;
in a few seconds it was decidedly making an effort to
swing round, and in less than a minute was steadily
careering in a circle parallel to the sides of the glass
dish, the lower end of the bob tracing a circle of per-
haps two inches in diameter, or the size of a crown-
piece, from left to right, as the hands of a watch move.
The lecturer said he would call this the normal motion,
being that which was invariably produced, at least
after some practice; but it was a curious fact, and as
yet unaccountable, that many of the movements were
different with different individuals-that they were
often even different with a given individual on first
experimenting and after considerable practice; but that
there came a time when an operator could depend on
the movement peculiar to himself occurring without
exception. This left-to-right movement invariably
occurred however often the experiment was made, the
bob invariably beginning to swing with the sun a few
seconds after the application of the finger and thumb
to the knob. He stated, too, that many experiments
which at first were difficult, or gave dubious results,
became sure and unvarying as the operator increased
in delicacy by practice.
The mode of stopping the movement is by taking a
piece of bone in the left hand, when the motion gra-
dually slackens and ceases. With Mr Rutter the bob
will stop almost immediately, but with Dr Madden the
time occupied is tediously long, and therefore more
forcible means were on the present occasion employed
when it was wished to commence a new experiment.
The lecturer, however, shewed an equally satisfactory
experiment. Placing the finger and thumb of the right
hand to the knob, and holding a piece of bone in the
left, no movement whatever could be produced: on
dropping the bone from his palm, the bob was instantly
stirred, and in a few seconds once more traced out the
normal circle.
When only the finger was applied to the knob, the
bob set up, not a circular but a to-and-fro movement,
like a clock pendulum. On stopping it and applying
the thumb only, a similar pendulation was produced,
but in a direction directly across and perpendicular to
the former. The direction of the swing for finger and
thumb respectively was always the same, however often
the experiment might be tried — that is, calling the
direction for the finger N. and S., that for the thumb
was E. and W.; and if while the finger was producing
the N. and S. swing the thumb was substituted, the
bob was instantly affected-staggered, so to speak-and
shuffled itself into the E. and W. direction.
-
While the lecturer held the knob by his finger and
thumb, a person standing by touched the operator's
left hand with his own right, when, instead of a circular
motion, an oscillatory one was produced, but in a
direction different from the other two. On this a chain
was formed by the gentlemen present joining hands,
and as the chain increased the arc of oscillation
increased until the bob swung as far as the sides of
the dish; the contribution of a few more hands, and it
must have struck the glass. If the bystander touched
the experimenter with his finger (index) only, the same

effect was produced as if the experimenter touched the
instrument with his finger only, and so with the
thumb.
With globules of this character the lecturer proceeded
to experiment.
the sugar was then substituted one globule of sulphur,
30th dilution, and the motion was at once reversed. In
consequence of a question from a gentleman present, as
the lecturer was about to proceed with a new substance,
he made the following curious statement: that he had
been trying the magnetoscope with gold, and it struck
him as strange that the gold ring on his left hand
appeared inert, while that which he held acted. But
on putting by the ring for a short time, it was found to
influence the instrument like any other specimen. He
had found, too, a similar difference with newly-adopted
garments and such as had been long worn-as though
articles in time became saturated with an individual's
electricity, and became a part of himself.
First placing his right hand on the knob, a few
Now came an extraordinary and mysterious part of globules of pure sugar were placed on his left palm;
the subject. The lecturer stated that if, while the but no effect whatever was produced by the sugar, the
operator's finger and thumb were producing the left-to-direct circular movement taking place as usual. For
right movement, a woman were to touch his left hand,
the bob would immediately refuse to proceed in the
normal direction, and be carried round in the opposite
direction-right to left. No ladies were present, but the
lecturer stated that anything which had been worn or
carried about by a female for a length of time, or even
a letter written by one, would do as well. Incredible
as this may seem, it was put to the proof and suc-
ceeded. The instrument being at rest, the operator
placed his right hand on the knob, and a letter written
by a lady was laid in the palm of his left, when the
bob immediately commenced a circular movement from
right to left. This was tried with several documents,
one of which was of the date of September 27th,
twenty-four days previous. One of these experi-
ments was startling, and touches on a disputed and
much-vexed question; but we may venture to state
what really occurred. One letter placed on the hand
produced an apparent indecision on the part of the bob
to such an extent that the lecturer 'gave it up: he
could not tell what sex the writer was. It proved to
be a woman; but the writing had been penned while in
the mesmeric sleep, on which the lecturer remarked,
that Mr Rutter had already ascertained the fact of the
disturbing influence exerted by a somnambulist.
The remainder of the experiments were performed
with a particular object, as it was imagined that the
phenomena now first exhibited had an important
bearing upon the homeopathic law and practice of
healing. But the interest of the experiments is not
confined to those who have this in view; and the most
anti-homœopath, at all events, must be indebted to the
heterodox practice for the means of performing some
of the most curious of all the experiments- means
unattainable elsewhere, and which were provided for a
purpose altogether different from the present, and there-
fore all the more beyond suspicion. We allude to the
homeopathic globules, attainable in any quantity from
the chemists. These are simply little pills of white
sugar, over which has been poured a tincture of that
medicine with which it is desired to saturate them.
This tincture may be of any potency or dilution, and
the globules are named accordingly. Thus a drop of
the strong, original, or mother tincture, say of bella-
donna, is diluted and thoroughly mixed with ninety-
nine drops of fluid. One drop of the mixture is taken
out, and of course contains a 100th part of a drop of
belladonna. This is diluted and thoroughly mixed with
ninety-nine drops more of fluid. One drop of this
mixture is taken out, and of course contains a 100th
part of a 100th part of a drop of belladonna-that
is, the 10,000th part of a drop. This is diluted and
thoroughly mixed with ninety-nine drops more of fluid.
One drop of this mixture is taken out, and of course
contains the 100th part of the 10,000th part of a drop
of belladonna-that is, the 1,000,000th part. Suppose
this process proceeded with to the twelfth, or still
more, to the thirtieth time, and it may be under-
stood how many were impressed with the idea that
a drop of such a preparation could not possibly
contain any appreciable quantity of belladonna, cer-
tainly none that could act, for good or ill, on the
animal economy.
But these preparations are gross
and material compared with the dilutions or potencies
often resorted to, where thirty is left behind, and the
chemist manipulates up to hundreds, and even thou-
sands. No wonder that men pooh-poohed, and declared
that in a drop of such a fluid, and still more certainly
in a globule of sugar moistened with a very small por-
tion of such drop, there could be no belladonna at all.
A globule of the 20,000th, and another of the 65,000th
sulp. produced no effect; but one of the 7000th acted
immediately.
A trituration was then tried. One grain of arsenic
had been rubbed down with ninety-nine grains of sugar-
of-milk. A small portion of this was placed on the left
palm, and caused the plumbob to stop; but on a bone
counter being also placed on the palm, the normal
movement from left to right ensued, as if nothing had
been there. It will be remembered that the effect of
the bone is to stop the circulation of the plumbob, and
that of the arsenic is also to stop it. The arsenic alone
succeeds in doing so; yet when the effort of the bone,
in the same direction, is added to it, they nullify instead
of assisting each other, and the influence of the right
hand is exerted as if the left held nothing at all. This
certainly is curious, whatever we may think of its
bearing on the homeopathic dogma: Similia similibus
curantur'-of which more anon.
A globule of arsenic of the 40,000th dilution was
tried, and stopped the motion.
On placing a globule of Bryonia (20th) in the left
palm, a pendulum - motion was produced in a line
running N.W. Calcarco-carbonica produced a N. and
S. pendulum; iodide of potassium a N.E.; muriate of
ammonia, an oscillation in a long, narrow ellipse lying
N. and S.; sulp. and mercury both gave a reverse
circular motion.
Be it remembered, 1st, That, however the direction
and character of these movements altered, yet they
were invariably the same for the same substance-
insomuch that the operator, having one of the globules,
taken at random from any box, placed by a bystander
on his left palm, could, from the figure described by
the bob and its direction, pronounce what medicinal
substance the sugar contained; 2d, That the vibra-
tions here spoken of were not mere incipient agitations
of the bob, to which a wish to believe gave a positive
character, but bonâ-fide swingings to and fro, so that
the arc described by the lower end of the bob was
perhaps more than two inches long.
It will be seen that this new branch of magnetology,
though here shewn in more or less connection with
homoeopathy, and with what has hitherto been known as
animal magnetism, has no necessary dependence on
these proscribed subjects; neither are there the diffi-
culties of proof and the apparent openness to fraud,
and the consequent disinclination of many to experi-
ment, which attend the latter. The opponents of
these systems are apt to regard everything which
succeeds as a collusion or an accident, and every
failure as a damnatory proof; and the repugnance
even to experiment is extreme. Here the student may
acquaint himself with phenomena as curious, and at
first thought as incredible, as any that have aroused
the indignant incredulity of the wise, jealous for the

unassisted experimenter, consisting in gross, material
movements, leaving no room for delusion or illusion.
THE CLERICAL ODDITIES OF SHAKSPEARE.
DULL and prosy as he is, I have known other curates
duller and prosier than SIR NATHANIEL of Navarre.
Only three days since I heard an Oxford clerk and
'afternoon lecturer' of the same pedantic class dis-
course to a drowsy congregation in terms most prolix,
plethoric, polysyllabic, about abstract dogmas, and what
I fear Mr Carlyle would impatiently call' supervenient
moonshine'—the entire homily being A 1 of the kind,
and disposing me (such was the only practical infe-
rence' I culled from it) to be more leniently disposed
towards the aforesaid Navarrese curate, whom, sooth to
say, I had been wont to set down in my private opinion
as an unmitigated bore. Those who could toil through
his classico-barbarous communings with Holofernes the
schoolmaster, were welcome to their labour of love:
to me it was love's labour lost. Yet, on reading again
the sayings and doings of the reverend pedant, I liked
him better, esteemed him more respectfully, and began
to think he might fill a pulpit as meritoriously as some
living divines I know, who count it an honour to be
wholly unread in Shakspeare, and of course absolutely
ignorant of the mere existence, ideal or actual, possible
or preterite, of such a clerical brother as poor Sir
Nathaniel.
This 'good master parson,' as Jaquenetta calls him,
is, with all his scholasticism, a sociable, kindly-disposed,
open-hearted creature. He relishes sport-such as
deer-hunting-when conducted decently and in order,
and approvingly criticises it as 'very reverend sport,
truly; and done in the testimony of a good conscience.'
When Dominie Holofernes is to dine to-day' at the
house of one of his scholars, and, in the pride of his
heart, makes bold, 'on the privilege he has with the
parents of the aforesaid child or pupil' (the sort of
privilege Abel Sampson might have exercised at Ellan-
gowan), to invite Sir Nathaniel too-undertaking his
ben venuto, if, before repast, it shall please him to
gratify the table with a grace'-how benignantly Sir
Nat accepts the summons to a 'spread,' and how preg-
nantly he moralises on the benefits of convivial
relaxation! Saith Holofernes: 'I beseech your society.'
Maketh answer Sir Nat: And thank you too; for
society, saith the text, is the happiness of life.' A
very wholesome text, your reverence; even though
you might not give chapter and verse for it. No bilious
recluse is this pastoral worthy; no pale, pinched-up
Lenten starveling; no cadaverous ascetic, whose phiz
at a dinner-party would be equivalent to a death's head.
He loves, does Sir Nathaniel, to move among his parish-
ioners to hold kindly intercourse with them, and repay
with the weighty bullion of learned speech the good fare
they press upon him. He has bowels, look you, and is
not simply an anatomy of a man. He is warmed and
cooled by the same summer and winter as his fellow-
Christians-fed with the same food-subject to the same
diseases. If you tickle him he will laugh, though with
somewhat ponderous and deliberate cachinnation, as
becomes his years and office. His self-complacency as
a scholar is harmlessly amusing. He loves to be called
a bookman by Goodman Dull, and yearns with com-
passion over that worthy's 'twice-sod simplicity'--
apologising for his rustic ignorance with the most
condescending good-will. Sir, he hath never fed of
the dainties that are bred in a book; he hath not ate
paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink; his intellect
Love's Labour's Lost.
is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible
in the duller parts;
And such barren plants are set before us, that we thankful
should be
(Which we of taste and feeling are) for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he.'
The curate's humility and magnanimity are beautiful;
most exemplary his appreciation of his own superiority,
and his readiness to suggest excuses for inferior genius.
He is not envious of the transcendent abilities of his
companion and parish schoolmaster Holofernes-a still
greater dominie than that renowned veteran of 'Sweet
Auburn,' whose academic qualifications Goldsmith sums
up by telling us that
'In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,
For even though vanquished he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thund'ring sound
Amazed the gaping rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,
That one small head should carry all he knew.'
6
Sir Nathaniel unreservedly eulogises the conversational
powers of the dominie, as displayed at the dinner they
duly honoured with their presence :-'I praise God for
you, sir: your reasons at dinner have been sharp and
sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty without
affectation, audacious without impudency, learned
without opinion, and strange without heresy.' He has
a keen zest for the dominie's choice of words, and takes
out his table-book with the air of Mr Pickwick him-
self, to note down whatever strikes him as a most
singular and choice epithet;' in fact, he is a little awed
by the multifarious knowledge and philologic acumen
of his learned friend, who is certainly the profounder
scholar of the twain. They have both, as that witty
juvenal, Moth, observes, 'been at a great feast of lan-
guages, and stolen the scraps;' or as Costard phrases
it, they have lived long in the alms-basket of words.'
Sir Nathaniel cannot bend the bow of Holofernes: his
learning is of a baser stamp; his adjectives are of fewer
syllables; his critical skill is comparatively crude and
unexercised. He is but a foolish mild man,' as one of
his parishioners describes him-'an honest man, look
you, and soon dashed! He is a marvellous good neigh-
bour, in sooth, and a very good bowler.' But away
from the bowling-green, and the parishioner's pudding-
time, and the schoolmaster's society, this honest man
is 'soon dashed.'
C
Of this he exhibits a melancholy instance when
undertaking to enact the part of Alexander the Great
in the pageant of the Nine Worthies.' The hedge-
priest, as Biron flippantly calls him, is to come forth,
armed in complete steel, as the personator of the old-
world conqueror. Surely they might have given his
reverence another rôle. Signal is his failure in attempt-
ing the stalwart Macedonian. He launches out boldly,
and with considerable histrionic promise:
"When in the world I lived, I was the world's commander;
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering
might;
My 'scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander'—
but here, alas! the rudeness of criticism dismays the
magnifico, and makes him forget his part. They have
put it out of his head; they have ravelled the thread
of his discourse. He must begin again at the begin-
ning, if he is to do it at all. He does begin again, with
'When in the world I lived'—
but there's no bearing up against a quizzical audience,
with its interruptions, and its asides, and its per-
sonalities. So good Sir Nathaniel is fain to retreat
from such a presence-scared from his senses and from
the stage by naughty Costard's noisy strictures: 'A

conqueror, and afraid to speak!-run away for shame,
Alisander; which Alisander incontinently does, Cos-
tard the while covering his retreat with the indul-
gent apology: 'He is a marvellous good neighbour, in
sooth, and a very good bowler; but for Alisander,
alas! you see how 'tis-a little o'erparted.' We hope
the villagers did not giggle next Sunday when the
curate, who had thus been 'a little o'erparted' during
the week, stepped demurely from the vestry, in garb
and mien so incompatible with those of Philip's warlike
son; and we hope that, for the future, when Sir
Nathaniel wanted secular recreation, he stuck to nine-
pins, and abjured the 'Nine Worthies.'
6
We could have relished further acquaintance than is
vouchsafed us with the vicar of the Forest of Arden,
SIR OLIVER MAR-TEXT.* The pastor of such a dreamland
district the shepherd of such sheep as Corin and
Silvius, of that deliciously simple hind, William, who
suffers Touchstone to bully him with such forgiving
good-nature, and of those sylvan nymphs, Phebe and
Audrey must have been a man worth knowing, and
worth talking to, patula recubans sub tegmine fagi.'
He may, like Berkeley, have had every virtue under
heaven for all we know; but we only regard him as a
butt for Touchstone's wit-for the archery whereof he
steps forward, presents an unflinching broadside, and,
having received the shaft, forthwith retires; and we
lose sight of him for once and aye amid the umbrageous
glades of his romantic parish. He is a good rubrician,
however, and stickles for canonical order in the projected
espousals of Touchstone and Audrey; and that in a
stanch spirit of orthodoxy, which inclines us to resent
the disrespect of Jaques, who dissuades the jester from
being married under a bush, like a beggar'-Jaques
ought to have known better than to slur the 'melan-
choly boughs' and ordained clergy of the Forest of
Arden-and bids him 'get to church, and have a good
priest that can tell what marriage is ;' insolently adding,
'this fellow will but join you together as they join
wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel,
and, like green timber, warp, warp.' Quite exemplary,
and almost touching, is the meek firmness of the good
vicar under this provocation. "Tis no matter,' quoth
he; 'ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me
out of my calling.' Jaques treats his reverence as
though he were the drunken, red-nosed, disreputable
Fleet parson himself. But Audrey, kind soul! has a
conviction-Audrey is a bit of a low-churchwoman, we
fancy-that, 'faith, the priest was good enough, for all
the old gentleman's saying.' But Touchstone silences
her protest by his newly-acquired scruples in matters
ecclesiastical, having become quite severe in his views
of spiritual functions; and assures his buxom bride
that the said vicar is a most wicked Sir Oliver,
Audrey; a most vile Mar-text.' Perhaps 'twas as well,
after all, that Sir Oliver was not again dragged forth
from his bosky manse to encounter Touchstone's rail-
lery, for which, we fear, his limited experience and
recluse habits had indifferently prepared him. In
personal physique he may have been ample and sub-
stantial as Thomson's 'round, fat, oily man of God;'
but we only know that, athwart the copses of leafy
Arden, he comes like a shadow, and so departs.

reminded me of our present poet-laureate's Parson

Shockingly did I scandalise my friend- -a peppery
Welshman withal-by suggesting that Sir Hugh Evans
might deserve a place in the calendar as much as some
of the worthies therein canonised. Sir Hugh, notwith-
standing his little affair' with that choleric foreigner,
Dr Caius, is radically a peacemaker, and as such has
some recognition among the beatitudes. He is unequi-
vocally a good creature-overflowing with the milk,
the very cream, of human kindness; one who loves
sincerity and truthfulness; with a nature as fresh,
fragrant, mellow as a Windsor pear. Act the first,
scene the first, sentence the first of the Merry Wives'
introduces him in the earnest attitude of a benevolent
make-peace, a kindly mediator, a persuader of one who
will not be persuaded-namely, fussy Justice Shallow.
He loves to see his parishioners dwelling in unity. He
has fine stores of remonstrance for litigious folks-and
Shallow is as litigiously disposed as Peter Peebles him-
self; or as that beau ideal of the species, old Chicaneau,
in Racine's 'Plaideurs '- he bids them leave their
'pribbles and prabbles,' and discuss some practical
question of parochial interest, some pleasant amalgam
of utilitarianism and romance, such as a marriage-
settlement between Master Abraham and sweet Anne
Page-a damsel whose seven hundred pounds, and
possibilities, is goot gifts:' in truth Sir Hugh is never
at a loss for 'some device in his prain, which prings
goot discretions with it.' He loves the truth, does
Parson Evans. 'Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise
a liar as I do despise one that is false; or'-mark the
naïveté of his emphasis, itself proof positive of his
simple veracity-'or, as I despise one that is not true.'
What a grand climacteric is involved in the paraphrase!
In the same spirit, he has no stomach for 'unveracities'
in phraseology, and repudiates the bombastics of ancient
Pistol; while he is charitable towards the slips of Master
Abraham, because his meaning is good. Sir Hugh's
good appetite and sound principle are simultaneously
illustrated in his haste to join the steaming dinner-
table of hospitable Gaffer Page, as soon as the hot
venison pasty is announced: not for a good deal will
he 'be absence at the grace.' And how genial his eager-
ness to return to the social board, when called from it
by the business of a message to Dame Quickly: 'I
pray you begone,' so he urges the dilatory messenger-
I will make an end of my dinner: there's pippins and
cheese to come.' We almost overhear the smack of
his lips, and see the water surging on them as he utters
that aspiration after pippins and cheese in prospectú.
Shocking it would have been had so much bonhomie
been prematurely cut off by the devouring sword of
Dr Caius, whose challenge fills Sir Hugh with such
'cholers and trempling of mind' that he exclaims
in the field near Frogmore: 'Mercy on me! I have

THE FRAMEWORK-KNITTING MANUFACTURES
OF THE MIDLAND COUNTIES.
THERE is much of instruction to be derived from a
visit to any manufacturing locality. The stir of life
grows busier, and men seem more thoughtful and
earnest as we enter the principal town of a populous
district. We look around with exultation at the pro-
gress of civilisation, and survey with complacency
and satisfaction the numerous monuments that indicate
the skill and attest the industry of man. Alas! that
partial suffering should so frequently accompany the
advancing steps of social life. Yet, doubtless, for wise
purposes is it ordered that progress in communities,
as in individual life and character, cannot be secured
without effort or struggle. Social life is a gigantic
panorama, the stern realities of which awaken within
us thoughtfulness and solemnity. A population multi-
plying its resources and augmenting its wealth by the
arts of industry is a picture pleasant to gaze upon;
but the mighty wheel revolves, and another view
sents to our sight a portion of the community passing
through the ordeal of poverty, or battling against
adverse circumstances.
--
It is usually arranged for the framework-knitter to
have the loom in his own dwelling-house. The weaver
is consequently his own master, and may play or work
as suits him a position exactly analogous to that of
the handloom-weaver. In fact, the framework-knitter
is a handloom-weaver of stockings, the machine which
he works being more costly than the looms of the class
of operatives referred to. But there are frequent
exceptions to this arrangement. The manufacturer
very often places a number of looms under the care of
one individual, who is what is termed the middle-
man.' He obtains material from the manufacturer,
and returns it when made up into goods, receiving the
amount due for labour, and distributing it amongst
the workmen.
The changes in machinery which are superseding
the labour of the framework-knitter are of a twofold
character. Some few years ago, a Frenchman named
Claussen, who had emigrated to Massachusetts, United
States, invented a circular knitting-machine, on the
rotary principle, so simple in its construction, and so
easily managed, that any young person of ordinary
capacity may work it. The web manufactured on
this machine, like the lengths of web produced on the
framework-knitting looms of great width, is made up
pre-into what are technically termed 'cut-ups'—
-a phrase
which indicates the value and character of the goods,
as compared with other products of the stocking-loom
-namely, that they are cut out of the piece of web,
and then sewed to their proper shapes; as hose, gloves,
or shirts. These circular machines, on their first intro-
duction into England, made but slow progress in the
estimation of the manufacturers. The reason of this
indisposition to adopt the new machine is apparent
enough: it is calculated to supersede the more expen-
sive machinery in use, and entail, therefore, a heavy
loss upon those manufacturers whose capital is invested
in looms. If, for instance, a stocking-loom, worked by
an adult knitter of average dexterity, produced as
much web in the course of a week as would cut up into
six dozen pairs of stockings; and the circular machine,
turned by a boy or girl, would produce only a similar
quantity of web, it is clear that inasmuch as the former
machine is three times as costly as the latter, the
holder of stocking-looms would be a great loser by
adopting the new invention. Hence the indisposition,
on the part of manufacturers of large capital, to the
employment of Claussen's rotary machine. But the
I comparison, so far as regards the quantity of web pro-
duced on the machines, does not terminate here. This
newly-invented machine may be worked by steam-
power, without any extra outlay, which is not the case
with the stocking-loom.
In an age of manufacturing enterprise like ours,
mechanical genius waves its triumphant sceptre over
the realm of industry. It bridges over seas, connects
continents, brings the denizens of far-off lands into
intercourse with each other, and joins the very spheres;
but its wonders cease not in celerity of transit or power
of locomotion: they unfold themselves in the production
of the commonest fabrics and the richest textiles, in
the calico that swathes the limbs of the offspring of
poverty, and the costly fabrics that decorate the persons
of the wealthy. It touches the loom, and multiplies its
powers of production- makes it, as it were, a thing
of life,' the embodiment of the mechanician's creative
mind-obedient to his slightest impulse, and laying the
produce of its never-tiring limbs submissively at his
feet. Among all the marvels which mechanical genius
has wrought, none are more remarkable, or suggestive
of more important results, than those with which we
may familiarise ourselves in the localities of manufac-
turing industry.
We discern parallel phases of social life, through the
instrumentality of machinery, constantly presenting
themselves. The handloom - weaver of cotton and
woollen fabrics is associated with an era that is passing
away from the memory of the living; yet the frame-
work - knitter now takes the place of the handloom-
weaver, and a new invention of machinery brings
about similar results.
The weaving of stockings in this country is almost
As in other branches of manufacture, so in the
hosiery, firms have sprung up whose capital, not being
invested in looms, has been applied to the purchase of
circular machines, which have been placed in factories to
be worked by steam-power. Those manufacturers who

are not holders of machinery, but purchasers of goods
from men who worked, or paid others for working,
their own frames, naturally resort to the cheapest
market for their fabrics; and as the produce of the
newly-invented machines may be increased at little-Comer el Buyo (Chewing the Buyo.)
cost, it is probable that the cut-up goods made from
web produced on the circular machines will gradually
supersede that class of articles which is at present
manufactured on the coarser gauge stocking-loom. A
vast diminution of hands employed will be the conse-
quence; and framework-knitters hitherto engaged in
the manufacture of these cut-up goods must seek some
other employment.
little has been written about the Philippines and
their inhabitants, many of whose customs are both
strange and interesting. Perhaps not the least singular
of these is that which forms the subject of our sketch
A second improvement, which has the same tendency
to cheapen production and diminish labour, is effected
by widening the loom of Lee, and producing as many as
three pairs of stockings on the same frame. Although,
as regards what is called the 'fashioning' or shaping of
the stockings thus manufactured, there is as yet much
that is imperfect and defective, we may, nevertheless,
regard it as matter of certainty, that in a very limited
period mechanical ingenuity will triumph over these
difficulties, and carry into complete effect this important
improvement.
There are reflections springing out of a contemplation
of these changes in an extensive branch of manufactures
which it would not be wise to suppress. The philan-
thropic mind reverts to the condition of the framework-
knitter. In this competition of improved machinery,
what is the fate that awaits him? There are about
30,000 framework-knitters in the Midland Counties,
four-fifths of which number are engaged in the cotton
branches, and the other fifth in the production of silk-
manufactures. Now the great changes which these
improvements in machinery involve in the social
condition of so large a body of workmen suggest
the attitude which society ought to assume towards
them. As they pass through the ordeal which
assuredly awaits them, we should regard them with
a benignant eye and a feeling heart. We may
greatly ameliorate their condition by prompt advice
and assistance. There are ways and means of
accomplishing this without in any degree reducing
them to a state of pauperism, or infringing upon that
principle of self-respect which it should ever be our
object to develop and cultivate amongst the working-
classes. The suggestion of remedial measures I leave
to wiser heads than mine. Should they fail, however,
in making due provision for the emergency, the time
will most likely arrive shortly when it will be necessary
to come forward with some practical plan for the relief
and support of an intelligent body of working-men.
CHEWING THE BUYO.
A SKETCH OF THE PHILIPPINES.
The buyo is a thing composed of three ingredients-
the leaf of the buyo-palm, a sea-shell which is a species
of periwinkle, and a root similar in properties to the
betel of India. It is prepared thus: the leaves of the
palm, from which it has its name, are collected at a
certain season, cut into parallelograms, and spread
upon a board or table with the inner cuticle removed.
Upon this the powdered root and the shell, also pul-
verised, are spread in a somewhat thick layer. The
shell of itself is a strong alkali, and forms a chief ingre-
dient in the mixture. After having been exposed for
some time to the sun, the buyo-leaf is rolled inwardly,
so as to enclose the other substances, and is thus formed
into a regular cartridge, somewhat resembling a cheroot.
Thus prepared, the buyo is ready for use-that is, to be
eaten.
In order that it may be carried conveniently in the
pocket, it is packed in small cases formed out of the
leaves of another species of the palm-tree. Each of
these cases contains a dozen cartridges of the buyo.
Buyo-eating is a habit which must be cultivated
before it becomes agreeable. To the stranger, the taste
of the buyo is about as pleasant as tobacco to him
who chews it for the first time; and although it is not
followed by the terrible sickness that accompanies the
latter operation, it is sure to excoriate the tongue of
the rash tyro, and leave his mouth and throat almost
skinless. Having once undergone this fearful matri-
culation, he feels ever afterwards a craving to return
to the indulgence, and the appetite is soon confirmed.
In Manilla every one smokes, every one chews buyo-
man, woman, and child, Indian or Spaniard. Strangers
who arrive there, though repudiating the habit for
awhile, soon take to it, and become the most confirmed
buyo-eaters in the place. Two acquaintances meet
upon the paseo, and stop to exchange their salutations.
One pulls out his cigarrero, and says: 'Quiere a fumar?'
(Will you smoke?') The other draws forth the ever-
ready buyo-case, and with equal politeness offers a roll
of the buyos. The commodities are exchanged, each
helping himself to a cartridge and a cigarrito. A flint
and steel are speedily produced, the cigars are lit, and
each takes a bite of buyo, while the conversation is
all the while proceeding. Thus three distinct opera-
tions are performed by the same individual at the same
time-eating, smoking, and talking! The juice arising
from the buyo in eating is of a strong red colour,
resembling blood. This circumstance reminds us of
an anecdote which is, I believe, well authenticated,
but at least is universally believed by the people
of Manilla. Some years ago a ship from Spain
arrived in the port of Manilla. Among the passen-

and producing many of the tropical products of com-
merce, the Philippine Isles remain almost as much a
terra incognita as China or Japan!
These islands offer a striking illustration of the adage,
that knowledge is power.' They illustrate the power
of civilised man to subdue his savage fellow. For ages
have a few thousand Spanish merchants been enabled
to hold one-third of the native inhabitants in direct and
absolute slavery; while more than another third has
acknowledged their sway by the payment of tribute.
The remaining fraction consists of wild tribes, who, too
remote from the seat of commerce and power to make
them an object of conquest, still retain their barbarian
independence.
out to the Philippines with the design of settling
in the colony, and pushing his fortune by means of
his profession. On the morning after he had landed,
our doctor sallied forth for a walk on the paseo. He
had not proceeded far when his attention was attracted
to a young girl, a native, who was walking a few paces
ahead of him. He observed that every now and then
the girl stooped her head towards the pavement, which
was straightway spotted with blood! Alarmed on the
girl's account, our doctor walked rapidly after her,
observing that she still continued to expectorate blood
at intervals as she went. Before he could come up
with her, the girl had reached her home-a humble
cottage in the suburbs-into which she entered. The

The distracted parents, having learned the profession
of their visitor, immediately acceded to his request.
The child was put to bed in extreme affright, having
been told what was about to befall her. The nearest
padré was brought, and everything was arranged to
smooth the journey of her soul through the passes of
purgatory. The doctor plied his skill to the utmost;
but in vain. In less than twenty-four hours the girl
was dead!
As up to that time the young Indian had always
enjoyed excellent health, the doctor's prognostication
was regarded as an evidence of great and mysterious
skill. The fame of it soon spread through Manilla,
and in a few hours the newly-arrived physician was
beleaguered with patients, and in a fair way of accu-
mulating a fortune. In the midst of all this some
one had the curiosity to ask the doctor how he could
possibly have predicted the death of the girl, seeing
that she had been in perfect health a few hours before.
'Predict it!' replied the doctor-why, sir, I saw her
spit blood enough to have killed her half a dozen times.'
'Blood! How did you know it was blood?'
'How? From the colour. How else?'
'But every one spits red in Manilla!'
The doctor, who had already observed this fact, and
was labouring under some uneasiness in regard to it,
refused to make any further confession at the time; but
he had said enough to elucidate the mystery. The
thing soon spread throughout the city; and it became
clear to every one that what the new medico had taken
for blood, was nothing else than the red juice of the
buyo, and that the poor girl had died from the fear of
death caused by his prediction !
His patients now fled from him as speedily as they
had congregated; and to avoid the ridicule that awaited
him, as well as the indignation of the friends of the
deceased girl, our doctor was fain to escape from
Manilla, and return to Spain in the same ship that had
brought him out.
THE GOOD OLD TIMES IN PARIS.
THE world, since it was a world at all, has ever been
fond of singing the praises of the good old times. It
would seem a general rule, that so soon as we get
beyond a certain age, whatever that may be, we
acquire a high opinion of the past, and grumble at
everything new under the sun. One cause of this may
be, that distance lends enchantment to the view, and
that the history of the past, like a landscape travelled
over, loses in review all the rugged and wearisome
annoyances that rendered it scarcely bearable in the
journey. But it is hardly worth while to speculate
upon the causes of an absurdity which a little candid
retrospection will do more to dissipate than whole folios
of philosophy. We can easily understand a man who
sighs that he was not born a thousand years hence
instead of twenty or thirty years ago, but that any one
should encourage a regret that his lot in life was not
cast a few centuries back, seems inexplicable on any
rational grounds. The utter folly of praising the good
old times may be illustrated by a reference to the
wretched condition of most European cities; but we
shall confine ourselves to the single case of Paris, now
one of the most beautiful capitals in the world.
In the thirteenth century the streets of Paris were
not paved; they were muddy and filthy to a very
horrible degree, and swine constantly loitered about
and fed in them. At night there were no public lights,
and assassinations and robberies were far from infre-
quent. At the beginning of the fourteenth century public
lighting was begun on a limited scale; and at best only
a few tallow candles were put up in prominent situa-
tions. The improvement, accordingly, did little good,
and the numerous bands of thieves had it still pretty
much their own way. Severity of punishment seldom

was the general custom at this period to cut off the
ears of a condemned thief after the term of his impri-
sonment had elapsed. This was done that offenders
might be readily recognised should they dare again to
enter the city, banishment from which was a part of
the sentence of such as were destined to be cropped.
But they often found it easier to fabricate false ears
than to gain a livelihood away from the arena of their
exploits; and this measure, severe and cruel as it
was, was found inefficient to rid the capital of their
presence.
Among the various adventures with thieves, detailed
by an author contemporaneous with Louis XIII., the
following affords a rich example of the organization of
the domestic brigands of the time, and of the wretched
security which the capital afforded to its inhabitants:-
A celebrated advocate named Polidamor had by his
reputation for riches aroused the covetousness of some
chiefs of a band of brigands, who flattered themselves
that could they catch him they would obtain possession
of an important sum. They placed upon his track
three bold fellows, who, after many fruitless endeavours,
encountered him one evening accompanied only by a
single lackey. Seizing fast hold of himself and atten-
dant, they rifled him in a twinkling; and as he had
accidentally left his purse at home, they took his rich
cloak of Spanish cloth and silk, which was quite
new, and of great value. Polidamor, who at first
resisted, found himself compelled to yield to force, but
asked as a favour to be allowed to redeem his mantle.
This was agreed to at the price of thirty pistoles; and
the rogues appointed a rendezvous the next day, at six
in the evening, on the same spot, for the purpose of
effecting the exchange. They recommended him to
come alone, assuring him that his life would be endan-
gered should he appear accompanied with an escort.
Polidamor repaired to the place at the appointed hour,
and after a few moments of expectation he saw a car-
riage approaching in which were seated four persons
in the garb of gentlemen. They descended from the
vehicle, and one of them, advancing towards the advo-
cate, asked him in a low voice if he were not in
search of a cloak of Spanish cloth and silk. The
victim replied in the affirmative, and declared himself
prepared to redeem it at the sum at which it had been
taxed. The thieves having assured themselves that
he was alone, seized him, and made him get into the
carriage; and one of them presenting a pistol to his
breast, bade him hold his tongue under pain of instant
death, while another blindfolded him. As the advocate
trembled with fear, they assured him that no harm was
intended, and bade the coachman drive on.
After a rapid flight, which was yet long enough to
inspire the prisoner with deadly terror, the carriage
stopped in front of a large mansion, the gate of which
opened to receive them, and closed again as soon as
they had passed the threshold. The robbers alighted
with their captive, from whose eyes they now removed
the bandage. He was led into an immense saloon,
where were a number of tables, upon which the choicest
viands were profusely spread, and seated at which
was a company of gentlemanly-looking personages,
who chatted familiarly together without the slightest
demonstration of confusion or alarm. His guardians
again enjoined him to lay aside all fear, informed him
that he was in good society, and that they had brought
him there solely that they might enjoy the pleasure of
his company at supper. In the meanwhile water was
served to the guests, that they might wash their hands
before sitting at table. Every man took his place, and
a seat was assigned to Polidamor at the upper and
privileged end of the board. Astonished, or rather
stupified at the strange circumstances of his adventure,
he would willingly have abstained from taking any part
in the repast; but he was compelled to make a show

An Italian thief, an enterprising and ingenious
rogue, adopted a singular expedient for robbing
women at their devotions in church. He placed him-
self on his knees by the side of his intended prey,
holding in a pair of artificial hands a book of devotion,
to which he made a show of the most devout attention,
while with his natural hands he cut the watch or purse-
string of his unsuspecting neighbour. This stratagem,
favoured by the fashion, then general, of wearing
mantles, met with great success, and of course soon
produced a host of clumsy imitators, and excited the
vigilance of the police, who at length made so many
seizures of solemn-faced devotees provided with wooden
kid-gloved hands, that it fell into complete discredit,
and was at last abandoned by the profession.

removed, one of the gentlemen who had assisted in his
capture accosted him with polite expressions of regret
at his want of appetite. During the interchange of
courtesies which ensued, one of the bandits took a lute,
another a viol, and the party began to amuse them-
selves with music. The advocate was then invited to
walk into a neighbouring room, where he perceived a
considerable number of mantles ranged in order. He
was desired to select his own, and to count out the
thirty pistoles agreed upon, together with one for
coach-hire, and one more for his share of the reckoning
at supper.
Polidamor, who had been apprehensive
that the drama of which his mantle had been the occa-
sion might have a very different dénouement, was but
too well pleased to be quit at such a cost, and he took
leave of the assembly with unfeigned expressions of
gratitude. The carriage was called, and before enter-
ing it he was again blindfolded; his former conductors
returned with him to the spot where he had been
seized, where, removing the bandage from his eyes,
they allowed him to alight, presenting him at the same
moment with a ticket sealed with green wax, and
having these words inscribed in large letters, Freed
by the Great Band.' This ticket was a passport securing
his mantle, purse, and person against all further
assaults. Hastening to regain his residence with all
speed, he was assailed at a narrow turning by three
other rascals, who demanded his purse or his life. The
advocate drew his ticket from his pocket, though he
had no great faith in it as a preservative, and presented
it to the thieves. One of them, provided with a dark
lantern, read it, returned it, and recommended him to
make haste home, where he at last arrived in safety.
Early in the seventeenth century the Parisian rogues
availed themselves of the regulations against the use
of snuff to pillage the snuff-takers. As the sale of
this article was forbidden by law to any but grocers
and apothecaries, and as even they could only retail it
to persons provided with the certificate of a medical
man, the annoyance of such restrictions was loudly
complained of. The rogues, ever ready to profit by
circumstances, opened houses for gaming-at that
period almost a universal vice-where 'snuff at dis-
cretion' was a tempting bait to those long accustomed
to a gratification all the more agreeable because it was
forbidden. Here the snuff-takers were diligently plied
with wine, and then cheated of their money; or, if too
temperate or suspicious to drink to excess, they were
unceremoniously plundered in a sham quarrel. To
such a length was this practice carried, that an ordi-
nance was at length issued in 1629, strictly forbidding
all snuff-takers from assembling in public places or
elsewhere, 'pour satisfaire leur goût!'
The thieves of the good old times were not only
more numerous in proportion to the population than
they are at present, but were also distinguished by
greater audacity and cruelty. They had recourse to
the most diabolical ingenuity to subdue the resistance
and to prevent the outcries of their victims. Under
the rule of Henry IV. a band of brigands arose, who,
in the garb, and with the manners of gentlemen, intro-
duced themselves into the best houses under the pretext
of private business, and when alone with the master,
demanded his money at the dagger's point. Some of
them made use of a gag-a contrivance designated at
the period the poire d'angoisse. This instrument was
of a spherical shape, and pierced all over with small
holes; it was forced into the mouth of the person
intended to be robbed, and upon touching a spring
sharp points protruded from every hole, at once in-
flicting the most horrible anguish, and preventing the
sufferer from uttering a single cry. It could not be
withdrawn but by the use of the proper key, which
contracted the spring. This device was adopted uni-
Cunning as were the rogues of a past age, they were
liable to capture like their modern successors. A gentle-
man having resorted to Paris on business, was hustled
one day in the precincts of the palace, and robbed of his
well-filled purse. Furious at the loss of a considerable
sum, he swore to be avenged. He procured a clever
mechanic, who, under his directions, contrived a kind
of hand-trap for the pocket, managed in such a manner
as to preclude the possibility of an attempt at purse-
stealing without detection. Having fixed the instru-
ment in its place, impatient for the revenge he had
promised himself, he sallied forth to promenade the
public walks, mingled with every group, and stopped
from time to time gazing about him with the air of
a greenhorn. Several days passed before anything
resulted from his plan; but one morning, while he was
gaping at the portraits of the kings of France in one of
the public galleries, he finds himself surrounded and
pushed about, precisely as in the former instance; he
feels a hand insinuating itself gently into the open
snare, and hears immediately the click of the instru-
ment, which assures him that the delinquent is safely
caught. Taking no notice, he walks on as if nothing
had happened, and resumes his promenade, drawing
after him the thief, whom pain and shame prevented
from making the least effort to disengage his hand.
Occasionally the gentleman would turn round, and
rebuke his unwilling follower for his importunity, and
thus drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon his awk-
ward position. At last, pretending to observe for the
first time the stranger's hand in his pocket, he flies
into a violent passion, accuses him of being a cut-purse,
and demands the sum he had previously lost, without
which he declares the villain shall be hanged. It
would seem that compounding a felony was nothing
in those days; for it is upon record that the thief,
though caught in the act, was permitted to send a
messenger to his comrades, who advanced the money,
and therewith purchased his liberty.
The people were forbidden to employ particular
materials in the fabrication of their clothing, to ride
in a coach, to decorate their apartments as they chose,
to purchase certain articles of furniture, and even
to give a dinner-party when and in what style they
chose. Under the Valois régime strict limits were
assigned to the expenses of the table, determining the
number of courses of which a banquet should consist,
and that of the dishes of which each course was to be
composed. Any guest who should fail to denounce an
infraction of the law of which he had been a witness,
was liable to a fine of forty livres; and officers of
justice, who might be present, were strictly enjoined
to quit the tables of their hosts, and institute imme-
diate proceedings against them. The rigour of these
regulations extended even to the kitchen, and the police
had the power of entry at all hours, to enforce com-
pliance with the statutes.
But it was during the prevalence of an epidemic that
it was least agreeable to live in France in the good

old times. No sooner did a contagious malady, or
one that was supposed to be so, make its appearance,
than the inhabitants of Paris were all forbidden to
remove from one residence to another, although their
term of tenancy had expired, until the judge of police
had received satisfactory evidence that the house they
desired to leave had not been affected by the contagion.
When a house was infected, a bundle of straw fastened
to one of the windows warned the public to avoid all
intercourse with the inmates. At a later period two
wooden crosses were substituted for the straw, one of
which was attached to the front door, and the other to
one of the windows in an upper storey. In 1596 the
provost of Paris having learned that the tenants of some
houses infected by an epidemic which was then making
great ravages, had removed these badges, issued an
ordinance commanding that those who transgressed in a
similar manner again should suffer the loss of the right
hand-a threat which was found perfectly efficient.
By an ordinance of 1533, persons recovering from
a contagious malady, together with their domestics,
and all the members of their families, were forbidden
to appear in the streets for a given period without
a white wand in their hands, to warn the public
of the danger of contact. Three years after, the autho-
rities were yet more severe against the convalescents,
who were ordered to remain shut up at home for
forty days after their cure; and even when the qua-
rantine had expired, they were not allowed to appear
in the streets until they had presented to a magistrate
a certificate from the commissary of their district,
attested by a declaration of six householders, that the
forty days had elapsed. In the preceding century (in
1498) an ordinance still more extraordinary had been
issued. It was at the coronation of Louis XII., when
a great number of the nobles came to Paris to take
part in the ceremony. The provost, desiring to guard
them from the danger of infection, published an order
that all persons of both sexes, suffering under certain
specified maladies, should quit the capital in twenty-
four hours, under the penalty of being thrown into the
river!

UNDER THE ROSE.
S. C.
There has arisen much petty controversy about the
common expression 'under the rose,' and two different
origins have been assigned. Some people assert that
it ought to be spelt under the rows, for that in former
days almost all towns were built with the second storey
projecting over the lower one-a sort of piazza or row, as
they termed it, and which may still be seen at Chester
and some other old English towns; and that whilst the
elders of the family were sitting at their windows gravely
enjoying the air, their sons and daughters were making
love where they could not see them under the rows.'
The other is much more elegant. Cupid, it is said, gave a
rose to Harpocrates, the god of silence, and from this
legend originated the practice that prevailed amongst
northern nations of suspending a rose from the ceiling
over the upper end of the table when it was intended
that the conversation was to be kept secret; and this it
was, according to others, which gave rise to the phrase,
under the rose.'
Antioch is, beyond dispute, the cheapest place in the
world, as well as one of the healthiest; and if it were
not for the ragged little boys, who hoot at every stranger
and throw stones at his door,. annoying you in every
possible way, I should prefer it as a place of residence
to any spot I have visited in Europe, Asia, Africa, or
America. My house was of perfectly new construction,
well planted, and well situated, and proof against water
as well as wind. I had four rooms-a sitting-room, a
dining-room, a bedroom, and a dressing-room. I had a
walled enclosure of about eighty feet square, where roses
and geraniums vied in beauty with jessamines and lilies.
There was also a poultry-yard, a pigeon-house, stables
for three horses, a storehouse, a kitchen, and a servant's
room. I had in the garden a grape-vine (muscatel),
a pomegranate-tree, a peach-tree, a plum-tree, an apricot,
and a China quince; and, in addition to all these, a
fountain perpetually jetting up water, and a well, and a
bathing-room. For all this accommodation I paid 350
piastres-about L.3 sterling; and this was a higher rent
than would be paid by any native. Of course the house
was unfurnished; but furniture in the East is seldom on
a grand scale: a divan, half a dozen chairs, a bedstead, a
mattress, a looking-glass, a table or two, and half a dozen
pipes and narghilies, are all one requires. Servants cost

ALL FOR THE BEST.
THE famous dogma, that this world of ours-the dirty
globe we trample under foot, and abuse like a pick-
pocket is the best of all possible worlds, has em-
ployed the pens and thoughts of many philosophers
and theologians, from the time of the Stoics down-
wards. When Bayle presumed to offer some objections,
founded on the evil which seems to be woven up
in the constitution both of man and his abiding-
place, he was at once quoited down by Leibnitz, who,
in his celebrated treatise, the Theodicæa, undertook to
shew that the imperfect parts assist in forming a
perfect whole, and that thus these parts themselves
are perfect when considered in their relation with the
whole. According to his system, physical and moral
evil are good as elements in a perfect and universal
order of things; and the conclusion was arrived at
from what was considered this unanswerable trilemma:
If the world be not the best of all possible worlds, God
must either-1. Not have known how to inake a better;
2. Not have been able to make a better; or 3. Not
have chosen to make a better. The first of these
suppositions impugns His omniscience, the second His
omnipotence, and the third His benevolence.*
doctrine was illustrated by Pope in his Essay on Man,
and laughed at by Voltaire in Candide; but, upon the
whole, Leibnitz seemed to have taken up a pretty
secure position, with which few cared to interfere.
This
For our own part, however, we have some doubt of
the orthodoxy of the Theodicaa itself, and are inclined to
consider the badness of the world as not at all irrecon-
cilable with the goodness, omniscience, and omnipotence
of its creator. At that geological period when the earth
was rich in marshes, and its most respectable inhabitants
were crocodiles, it could not have been perfect, or it
would not have been permitted to pass through so com-
plete a transformation as has occurred since then; and
at the present period, when nature seems to war against
herself with volcanoes, earthquakes, tempests, and inun-
dations, it would appear to be little more entitled to
the praises of the optimist. In like manner, the moral
nature of man-taking it as a whole, and not troubling
ourselves with the parts-could not have been perfect
in the savage state; neither could it have been so in
the middle ages; and let our scaffolds, penal colonies,
hulks, and jails answer for the present time.
That an omnipotent being could have created the
world without evil or the germs of evil is obvious; but
before impugning his benevolence in not having thus
exercised his power, we must consider what were the

PRICE 1d.
probable designs of his providence. Instead of forcibly
reconciling, by means of a paradox, the actual state of
this world with the character of its maker, Leibnitz
should have reflected on the purpose for which it was
intended in connection with its inhabitants.
As a
place of probation, a perfect world would have no
meaning. Man is thrown into ours, not to submit to
the evil circumstances by which he is surrounded, but
to contend with and conquer them. And this he does
to such purpose that he alters the face of nature her-
self, changes even the climate of his habitat, and eludes
when he cannot defy the laws of what is improperly
called destiny. If this is physically the best of all
possible worlds, man is everywhere and habitually
guilty of the proud impiety of the Babylonians of old;
for his whole life is spent, from generation to genera-
tion, in warring against the circumstances in which he
is placed. The same thing is observable in his moral
nature. If that were perfect-or, in other words, if it
had no germ of evil-there would be no merit in virtue.
But man is constitutionally both good and bad, yet
possessing withal a power or principle within, superior
both to mind and body, which determines his course
of action.
6
If this curious and important subject were better
investigated, we should use with more meaning than
we usually do the common expression, submission to
the decrees of Providence.' The wind, the tide, the
climate, sickness, death-all are decrees of Providence ;
but it is our business here not to submit ourselves
inconsiderately and unresistingly to every possible
operation of these decrees, but to grapple with and
struggle against them as long and as well as we can.
The optimism of Dr Priestley, which is a very good
type of that which is still common amongst us, was
founded, we think, upon entirely erroneous views
of Providence. He was thankful for the supersti-
tious horrors with which he was haunted in early
youth, because he thought they led to serious and
devout reflection; he was thankful, likewise, for the
delicate health which prevented his boyhood from being
tempted into sinful and foolish pastimes; he gave
thanks to God for the gift of stammering, since this
preserved him from attaching value to what has no
intrinsic value-eloquence; he was deeply grateful
for a bad musical ear, which happy quality saved him
from feelings of distress in listening to bad music; he
rendered devout thanks for being disappointed in his
purpose of going round the world with Captain Cook,
for his belief in the doctrine of Necessity, and for his
ignorance of the French language. The providen-
tial circumstance last mentioned was in his opinion
eminently favourable to the growth of new ideas.

Since Dr Priestley was thankful for his deficiencies
and disappointments, why did he not, in like manner,
regret his possession of the ordinary faculties, and of a
moderate competence in fortune, lest he might at some
time or other be tempted to abuse them? The system,
in our opinion, betrays a profound ignorance of the duty
of man upon the earth, and the law of Work under which
he lives. It is the same deification of circumstances which
gives its wildness to the fatalism of Eastern fanatics.
When the poor Hindoo finds his hut surrounded by an
inundation of the Ganges, instead of trying to escape
he gets upon the roof, and sitting down upon its apex,
lights his pipe, and looks calmly on at the rise of the
waters. Why so? Because Gunga is the goddess of
his worship, and his religious duty is submission to the
decrees of her providence! This may be excused, and
even admired, in the Hindoo, whose ignorant faith is
direct and sincere; but there is no excuse at all for the
well-taught Christian confounding the circumstance
with the providence which he knows to be beyond.
Such mistakes are mischievous, if it is only because
they give a certain appearance of reason to the sarcasm
of writers like Voltaire. There is a well-known story
in our own jest-books much to the point: A man
walking along the road is ridden over by a troop of
horse, but unexpectedly escapes unhurt. 'Down on
your knees, reprobate!' cries a bystander, as the fellow,
after gathering himself up, looks sulkily after the
enemy-Down on your knees, and thank Providence!'
"Thank Providence!' replies he. For what?-For
letting a troop of horse ride over me?' Here the idea
of Providence is improperly suggested, because it is
suggested in so direct a manner as to confound it with
the circumstance. That God was remotely the author
both of the accident and the escape there can be no
doubt, although the proximate cause of the former was
in all probability nothing more than the carelessness
of the pedestrian in choosing an improper part of the
road. The thankfulness was really due for the scheme
of Providence granting a farther period of probation to
one who had appeared to be called so abruptly to his
account. The bystander saw the finger of a higher
power only in the immediate circumstance, and thus
gave rise, very naturally, to the profane and ludicrous
repartee.
The thankfulness of Dr Priestley for his infirmities is
the germ of that feeling which produces 'the asceticism
and self-torture of devotees. To mortify the tastes
we possess is merely a modification of the feeling which
prompts us to be grateful for their absence. The men
who walk barefoot over burning coals, who cut them-
selves with knives, who swing upon an iron hook
inserted in the integuments of the back, who shut
themselves up from the social relations, are merely
improvers upon the original thought. That health,
freedom from pain, friendship, love, marriage, may all
lead to abuses, is only too true; but it is our duty to
combat actively the snares and seductions of this not
best of all possible worlds, rather than to attempt to
frustrate the plans of Providence for our appointed
probation.
That this is a working-day world is clear enough in
philosophy as well as in religion-a world where the im-
perfections are not perfect, as Leibnitz will have it, but
substantial and intentional evils to be encountered and
Overcome. We are here for the express purpose of
trying our strength with them; and they are here-the
work of an omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent
Creator for the express purpose of exercising our
energies, developing our faculties, and purifying and
elevating our moral nature. The Brahminical doctrine
of the transmigration of souls is not an idle supersti-
tion, but the allegorical expression of a philosophical
fact. The conduct, good or evil, of one generation does
actually condemn the next to an inferior, or elevate it
to a higher existence; and the moral and intellectual
nature of an individual does actually pass-though
without the intervention of death-through successive
stages of being. This is the condition of human life;
and the highest and humblest of human beings are
under the same law. All men, without exception,
assist or retard in a greater or less degree the progress
of civilisation; and from the philosopher in his study,
who devises the means of controlling the elements and
changing the aspect of the world, to the peasant who
turns up the soil for his daily bread, all will be judged
according to their intellectual powers and material
opportunities.
Upon the whole, it will be admitted that, at least in
our hemisphere, we perform with tolerable industry the
work allotted to us. We have already made some
progress in mastering, and rendering either harmless
or beneficial, the elements which, if left without con-
trol, would act as the evil genii of nature. We have
likewise made considerable advances in refinement and
morality; and at this moment the mind of the race is
swelling and heaving with great thoughts, which are
not circumscribed by selfish considerations of place or
time. Yes; even the doctrine of the Theodicca, if
taken in a refined and mystical sense, may be accepted.
The imperfections of the world, if judged according to
results, shew the perfection of the scheme of which they
are a part-and ALL IS FOR THE BEST.
AN OLD MAID'S FIRST LOVE.
I WENT once to the south of France for my health; and
being recommended to choose the neighbourhood of
Avignon, took my place, I scarcely know why, in the
diligence all the way from Paris. By this proceeding
I missed the steam-voyage down the Rhône, but fell
in with some very pleasant people, about whom I am
going to speak. I travelled in the intérieur, and from
Lyon had no one for companion but a fussy little lady,
of a certain age, who had a large basket, a parrot in a
cage, a little lapdog, a bandbox, a huge blue umbrella,
which she could never succeed in stowing anywhere,
and a moth-eaten muff. In my valetudinarian state I
was not pleased with this inroad - especially as the
little lady had a thin, pinched-up face, and obstinately
looked out of the window, while she popped about
the intérieur as if she had just taken lodgings and
was putting them in order, throwing me every now
and then some gracious apology in a not unpleasant
voice. Mince as you please, madam,' thought I; 'you
are a bore.' I am sorry to add that I was very
unaccommodating, gave no assistance in the stowing
away of the umbrella, and when Fanfreluche came and
placed his silken paws upon my knees, pushed him
away very rudely. The little old maid-it was evident
this was her quality-apologised for her dog as she
had done for herself, and went on arranging her furni-
ture-an operation not completed before we got to St
Saphorin.
For some hours a perfect silence was preserved,
although my companion several times gave a short, dry
cough, as if about to make an observation. At length,
the digestion of a hurried dinner being probably com-
pleted, I felt all of a sudden quite bland and sociable,
and began to be mightily ashamed of myself. 'De-
cidedly,' thought I, 'I must give this poor woman the
benefit of my conversation.' So I spoke, very likely
with that self-satisfied air assumed sometimes by men
accustomed to be well received. To my great vexation
the old maid had by this time taken offence, and
answered in a very stiff and reserved manner. Now
the whole absurdity of my conduct was evident to me,
and I determined to make amends. Being naturally
of a diplomatic turn, I kept quiet for awhile, and
then began to make advances to Fanfreluche.
The

I
poor animal bore no malice, and I won his heart by
stroking his long ears. Then I gave a piece of sugar
to the parrot; and having thus effected a practicable
breach, took the citadel by storm by pointing out a
more commodious way of arranging the great blue
umbrella.
We were capital friends thenceforward; and I soon
knew the history of Mile Nathalie Bernard by heart. A
mightily uninteresting history it was to all but herself;
so I shall not repeat it: suffice to say, that she had
lived long on her little income, as she called it, at
Lyon, and was now on her way to Avignon, where a
very important object called her. This was no other
than to save her niece Marie from a distasteful
marriage, which her parents, very good people, but
dazzled by the wealth of the unamiable suitor, wished
to bring about.
'And have you,' said I, 'any reasonable hope of
succeeding in your mission?'
'Parbleu!' replied the old maid, 'I have composed
a little speech on ill-assorted unions, which I am sure
will melt the hearts of my sister and my brother-in-law;
and if that does not succeed-why, I will make love to
the futur myself, and whisper in his ear that a comfort-
able little income available at once, and a willing old
maid, are better than a cross-grained damsel with
expectations only. You see I am resolved to make
any sacrifice to effect my object.'
I laughed at the old maid's disinterestedness, which
was perhaps greater than at first appeared. At least
she assured me that she had refused several respectable
offers, simply because she liked the independence of a
single life; and that if she had remained single to that
age, it was a sign that marriage had nothing attractive
for her in itself. We discussed the point learnedly as
the diligence rolled; and what with the original turn
of my companion's mind, the sportive disposition of
Fanfreluche, and the occasional disjointed soliloquies
of Coco, the parrot, our time passed very pleasantly.
When night came, Mlle Nathalie ensconced herself in
the corner behind her parcels and animals, and en-
deavoured to sleep; but the jolting of the diligence,
and her own lively imagination, wakened her every
five minutes; and I had each time to give her a solemn
assurance, on my word of honour as a gentleman, that
there was no particular danger of our being upset into
the Rhône.
We were ascending a steep hill next day; both had
got out to walk. I have omitted to note that it was
autumn. Trees and fields were touched by the golden
fingers of the season. The prospect was wide, but I
forget the precise locality. On the opposite side of the
Rhône, which rolled its rapid current in a deepening
valley to our right, rose a range of hills, covered with
fields that sloped wonderfully, and sometimes gave
place to precipices or wood-lined declivities. Here and
there the ruins of some old castle-reminiscences of
feudal times-rose amid lofty crags, and traced their
jagged outline against the deep-blue sky of Provence.
Nathalie became almost sentimental as she gazed
around on this beautiful scene.
trees.
We had climbed about half of the hill: the dili-
gence was a little way behind: the five horses were
stamping and striking fire from the pavement as they
struggled up with the ponderous vehicle: the other
passengers had lingered in the rear with the con-
ductor, who had pointed out a little auberge among some
We here saw a man preceding us upon the
road carrying a little bundle at the end of a stick over
his shoulder: he seemed to advance painfully. Our
attention was attracted-I scarcely knew why. He
paused a moment-then went on with an uncertain
step-paused again, staggered forward, and fell on his
face just as we came up. Mile Nathalie, with a
presence
of mind that surprised me, had her smelling-
bottle out in an instant, and was soon engaged in
restoring the unfortunate traveller to consciousness. I
assisted as well as I was able, and trust that my good-
will may atone for my awkwardness. Nathalie did
everything; and, just as the diligence reached us, was
gazing with delight on the languid opening of a pair of
as fine eyes as I have ever seen, and supporting in
her lap a head covered with beautiful curls. Even at
that moment, as I afterwards remembered, she looked
upon the young man as a thing over which she had
acquired a right of property. He is going our way,'
said she: 'let us lift him into the diligence."
'A beggarly Parisian; yo, yo!' quoth the postilion
as he passed, clacking his long whip.
'Who will answer for his fare?' inquired the con-
ductor.
'I will,' replied Nathalie, taking the words out of
my mouth.
In a few minutes the young man, who looked bewil-
dered and could not speak, was safely stowed among
Nathalie's other parcels; and the crest of the hill being
gained, we began rolling rapidly down a steep descent.
The little old maid, though in a perfect ecstasy of
delight-the incident evidently appeared to her quite
an adventure-behaved with remarkable prudence.
While I was puzzling my head to guess by what disease
this poor young man had been attacked, she was get-
ting ready the remedies that appeared to her the most
appropriate, in the shape of some excellent cakes and a
bottle of good wine, which she fished out of her huge
basket. Her protégé, made tame by hunger, allowed
himself to be treated like a child. First she gave him
a very small sip of Burgundy, then a diminutive frag-
ment of cake; and then another sip and another piece
of cake-insisting on his eating very slowly. Being
perfectly useless, I looked quietly on, and smiled to see
the submissiveness with which this fine, handsome fellow
allowed himself to be fed by the fussy old maid, and
how he kept his eyes fixed upon her with an expression
of wondering admiration.
Before we arrived at Avignon we knew the history
of the young man. He was an artist, who had spent
several years studying in Paris, without friends, without
resources, except a miserable pittance which his mother,
a poor peasant woman living in a village not far from
Aix, had managed to send him. At first he had been
upheld by hope; and although he knew that his mother
not only denied herself necessaries, but borrowed money
to support him, he was consoled by the idea that the
time would come when, by the efforts of his genius, he
would be able to repay everything with the accumu-
lated interest which affection alone would calculate.
But his expenses necessarily increased, and no receipts
came to meet them. He was compelled to apply to
his mother for further assistance. The answer was
one word-'impossible.' Then he endeavoured calmly
to examine his position, came to the conclusion that
for several years more he must be a burden to his
mother if he obstinately pursued his career, and that
she must be utterly ruined to insure his success. So
he gave up his art, sold everything he had to pay part
of his debts, and set out on foot to return to his village
and become a peasant, as his father had been before
him. The little money he had taken with him was
gone by the time he reached Lyon. He had passed
through that city without stopping, and for more than
two days, almost for two nights, had incessantly pursued
his journey, without rest and without food, until he
had reached the spot where, exhausted with fatigue
and hunger, he had fallen, perhaps to perish had we
not been there to assist him.
Nathalie listened with eager attention to this narra-
tive, told with a frankness which our sympathy excited.
Now and then she gave a convulsive start, or checked
a hysterical sob, and at last fairly burst into tears.
I was interested as well as she, but retained more
calmness to observe how moral beauty almost vainly

struggled to appear through the insignificant features
of this admirable woman. Her little eyes, reddened
with weeping; her pinched-up nose, blooming at the
point; her thin lips, probably accustomed to sarcasm;
her cheeks, with a leaded citron hue; her hair that
forked up in unmanageable curls-all combined to
obscure the exquisite expression of respect and sym-
pathy, perhaps already of love, sparkling from her
kindled soul, that could just be made out by an atten-
tive eye. At length, however, she became for a moment
perfectly beautiful, as, when the young painter had
finished his story, with an expression that shewed how
bitterly he regretted his abandoned art, she took both
his hands in hers, and exclaimed: 'No, mon enfant,
you shall not be thus disappointed. Your genius'-she
already took for granted he had genius-shall have an
opportunity for development. Your mother cannot do
what is necessary-she has played her part. I will be
a-second mother to you, in return for the little affec-
tion you can bestow on me without ingratitude to her
to whom you owe your life.'
'My life has to be paid for twice,' said he, kissing
her hand. Nathalie could not help looking round
proudly to me. It was so flattering to receive the
gallant attentions of so handsome a young man, that I
think she tried to forget how she had bought them.
In the exuberance of her hospitality, the little old
maid invited both Claude Richer and myself to spend
some time in the large farmhouse of her brother-in-
law. I declined, with a promise to be a frequent
visitor; but Claude, who was rather commanded than
asked, could do nothing but accept. I left them at
the diligence office, and saw them walk away, the little
Nathalie affecting to support her feeble companion.
For the honour of human nature let me add, that the
conductor said nothing about the fare. It would have
been indelicate,' he said to me, 'to remind Mile Nathalie
of her promise in the young man's presence. I know
her well; and she will pay me at a future time. At
anyrate I must shew that there is a heart under this
waistcoat.' So saying, the conductor thumped his
breast with simple admiration of his own humanity,
and went away, after recommending me to the Café de
Paris-indeed an excellent house.
I shall say nothing of a variety of little incidents
that occurred to me at Avignon, nor about my studies
on the history of the popes who resided there. I must
reserve myself entirely for the development of Nathalie's
romance, which I could not follow step by step, but
the chief features of which I was enabled to catch
during a series of visits I paid to the farmhouse.
Nathalie herself was very communicative to me at
first, and scarcely deigned to conceal her sentiments.
By degrees, however, as the catastrophe approached,
she became more and more reserved; and I had to
learn from others, or to guess the part she played.
The farmhouse was situated on the other side of the
river, in a small plain, fertile and well wooded. Old
Cossu, the owner, was a fine jolly fellow, but evidently
a little sharp in money-matters. I was surprised at
first that he received the visit of Claude favourably;
but when it came out that a good part of his capital
belonged to Nathalie, every circumstance of deference
to her was explained. Mère Cossu was not a very
remarkable personage; unless it be remarkable that
she entertained the most profound veneration for her
husband, quoted his commonest sayings as witticisms,
and was ready to laugh herself into convulsions if he
sneezed louder than usual. Marie was a charming
little person; perhaps a little too demure in her man-
ners, considering her wicked black eyes. She was
soon very friendly with Claude and me, but seemed to
prefer passing her time in whispered conversations
with Nathalie. I was let into the secret that their
conversation turned principally on the means of getting
rid of the husband-elect-a great lubberly fellow, who
lived some leagues off, and whose red face shone over
the garden - gate, in company with a huge nosegay,
regularly every Sunday morning. In spite of the com-
plying temper of old Cossu in other respects when
Nathalie gave her advice, he seemed obstinately bent
on choosing his own son-in-law. Parents are oftener
correct than romancers will allow in their negative
opinions on this delicate subject, but I cannot say as
much for them when they undertake to be affirmative.
I soon observed that Nathalie was not so entirely
devoted to the accomplishment of the object for which
she had undertaken her journey as she had promised;
and, above all, that she spoke no more of the disinte-
rested sacrifice of herself as a substitute for Marie. I
maliciously alluded to this subject in one of our private
confabulations, and Nathalie, instead of being offended,
frankly answered that she could not make big Paul
Boneau happy and assist Claude in his studies at the
same time. I have now,' she said, an occupation for
the rest of my life— namely, to develop this genius, of
which France will one day be proud; and I shall devote
myself to it unremittingly.'
'Come, Nathalie,' replied I, taking her arm in mine
as we crossed the poplar-meadow, 'have you no hope of
a reward?'
'I understand,' quoth she frankly; and I will not
play at cross-purposes with you. If this young man
really loves his art, and his art alone, as he pretends,
could he do better than reward me-as you call it-for
my assistance? The word has a cruel signification, but
you did not mean it unkindly.'
I looked at her wan, sallow countenance, that had
begun for some days to wear an expression of painful
anxiety. At that moment I saw over a hedge-but
she could not-Claude and Marie walking in a neigh-
bouring field, and pausing now and then to bend their
heads very close together in admiration of some very
common flower. 'Poor old maid,' thought I, you will
have no reward save the consciousness of your own
pure intentions.'
6
The minute development of this drama without dra-
matic scenes would perhaps be more instructive than
any elaborate analysis of human passions in general;
but it would require a volume, and I can only here give
a mere summary. Nathalie, in whom alone I felt par-
ticularly interested, soon found that she had deceived her-
self as to the nature of her sentiments for Claude-that
instead of regarding him with almost maternal solici-
tude, she loved him with an intensity that is the peculiar
characteristic of passions awakened late in life, when
the common consolation is inadmissible-' after all, I
may find better.' This was her last, her only chance
of a happiness, which she had declared to me she had
never dreamed of, but which in reality she had only
declined because it did not present itself to her under
all the conditions required by her refined and sensitive
mind. Claude, who was an excellent fellow, but inca-
pable of comprehending her or sacrificing himself, never
swerved from grateful deference to her; but I could
observe, that as the state of her feelings became more
apparent, he took greater care to mark the character of
his sentiments for her, and to insist with some affecta-
tion on the depth of his filial affection. Nathalie's eyes
were often red with tears-a fact which Claude did not
choose perhaps to notice, for fear of an explanation.
Marie, on the contrary, became more blooming every
day, while her eloquent eyes were still more assidu-
ously bent upon the ground. It was evident to me that
she and Claude understood one another perfectly well.
At length the same thing became evident to Nathalie.
How the revelation was made to her I do not know;
but sudden it must have been, for I met her one day
in the poplar-field, walking hurriedly along with an
extraordinary expression of despair in her countenance.
I know not why, but the thought at once occurred to
me that the Rhône ran rapid and deep not far off,

and I threw myself across her path. She started like
a guilty thing, but did not resist when I took her hand
and led her back slowly towards the farmhouse. We
had nearly reached it in silence when she suddenly
stopped, and bursting into tears, turned away into a
by-lane where was a little bench under an elm. Here
she sat down and sobbed for a long time, while I
stood by. At length she raised her head and asked
me: 'Do morality and religion require self-sacrifice
even to the end-even to making half a life a desert,
even to heart-breaking, even unto death?'
•
'It scarcely belongs to a selfish mortal to counsel
such virtue,' I replied; but it is because it is exer-
cised here and there, now and then, once in a hundred
years, that man can claim some affinity with the divine
nature.'
A smile of ineffable sweetness played about the poor
old girl's lips. She wiped her eyes, and began talking
of the changing aspect of the season, and how the trees
day by day more rapidly shed their leaves, and how
the Rhône had swelled within its ample bed, and of
various topics apparently unconnected with her frame
of mind, but all indicating that she felt the winter was
coming a long and dreary winter for her. At this
moment Fanfreluche, which had missed her, came down
the lane barking with fierce joy; and she took the
poor little beast in her arms, and exhaled the last bitter
feeling that tormented her in these words: Thou at
least lovest me-because I have fed thee!' In her
humility she seemed now to believe that her only
claim to love was her charity; and that even this claim
was not recognised except by a dog!

very yellow, and more than ever attentive to Fanfre-
luche and Coco. I even thought she devoted herself
too much to the service of these two troublesome pets,
to say nothing of a huge cat which she had added to
her menagerie, as a kind of hieroglyphic of her condi-
tion. 'How fare the married couple?' cried she, tossing
up her cork-screw curls. 'Still cooing and billing?'
'Mademoiselle,' said I, they are getting on pretty
well. Claude, finding the historic pencil not lucrative,
has taken to portrait-painting; and being no longer an
enthusiastic artist, talks even of adopting the more
expeditious method of the Daguerreotype. In the
meantime, half the tradesmen of Avignon, to say no-
thing of Aix, have bespoken caricatures of themselves
by his hand. Marie makes a tolerable wife, but has a
terrible will of her own, and is feared as well as loved.'
Nathalie tried to laugh; but the memory of her old
illusions coming over her, she leaned down towards the
cat she was nursing, and sparkling tears fell upon its
glossy fur.
THE POISON-EATERS.
A VERY interesting trial for murder took place lately
in Austria. The prisoner, Anna Alexander, was
acquitted by the jury, who, in the various questions
put to the witnesses, in order to discover whether the
murdered man, Lieutenant Mathew Wurzel, was a
poison-eater or not, educed some very curious evidence
relating to this class of persons.
As it is not generally known that eating poison is
actually practised in more countries than one, the
following account of the custom, given by a physician,
Dr T. von Tschudi, will not be without interest.
In some districts of Lower Austria and in Styria,
especially in those mountainous parts bordering on
Hungary, there prevails the strange habit of eating
arsenic. The peasantry in particular are given to it.
They obtain it under the name of hedri from the
travelling hucksters and gatherers of herbs, who, on
their side, get it from the glass-blowers, or purchase it
from the cow-doctors, quacks, or mountebanks.
I was not admitted to the secret of the family
conclave that took place, but learned simply that
Nathalie pleaded with feverish energy the love that
had grown up between Marie and Claude as an
insuperable bar to the proposed marriage between
Paul Boneau and her niece. Matters were arranged
by means of large sacrifices on the part of the heroic
maid. Paul's face ceased to beam over the garden-
gate on a Sunday morning; and by degrees the news
got abroad that Marie was betrothed to the young
artist. One day a decent old woman in sabots came to
the farmhouse: it was Claude's mother, who had walked
from Aix to see him. It was arranged that Claude
should pursue his studies a year longer, and then marry.
The poison-caters have a twofold aim in their dan-

the diligence office. What a party that was! Every blooming complexion, and an appearance of exuberant
one was in tears except Nathalie. She bore up man-health. Out of many examples I select the following:-
fully, if I may use the word; laughed, and actually
joked; but just as I handed Coco in, her factitious
courage yielded, and she burst into an agony of grief.
With officious zeal I kept at the window until the
diligence gave a lurch and started; and then turning
round I looked at Claude and Marie, who were already
mingling their eyes in selfish forgetfulness of their
benefactress, and said solemnly: There goes the best
woman ever created for this unworthy earth.' The
artist, who, for an ordinary man, did not lack senti-
ment, took my hand and said: Sir, I will quarrel
with any man who says less of that angel than you
have done.'
The marriage was brought about in less time than
had been agreed upon. Nathalie of course did not
come; but she sent some presents and a pleasant
letter of congratulation, in which she called herself
an inveterate old maid.' About a year afterwards
I passed through Lyon and saw her. She was still

and healthy. This girl had a lover whom she wished
to enchain still more firmly; and in order to obtain a
more pleasing exterior she had recourse to the well-
known means, and swallowed every week several doses
of arsenic. The desired result was obtained; and in a
few months she was much fuller in the figure, rosy-
cheeked, and, in short, quite according to her lover's
taste. In order to increase the effect, she was so rash
as to increase the dose of arsenic, and fell a victim to
her vanity: she was poisoned, and died an agonising
death.
The number of deaths in consequence of the immo-
derate enjoyment of arsenic is not inconsiderable,
especially among the young. Every priest who has

prevails could tell of such tragedies; and the inquiries
I have myself made on the subject have opened out
very singular details. Whether it arise from fear of
the law, which forbids the unauthorised possession of
arsenic, or whether it be that an inner voice proclaims
to him his sin, the arsenic-eater always conceals as
much as possible the employment of these dangerous
means. Generally speaking, it is only the confessional
or the deathbed that raises the veil from the terrible
secret.
The second object the poison-eaters have in view is
to make them, as they express it, 'better winded!'—
that is, to make their respiration easier when ascending
the mountains. Whenever they have far to go and
to mount a considerable height, they take a minute
morsel of arsenic and allow it gradually to dissolve.
The effect is surprising; and they ascend with ease
heights which otherwise they could climb only with
distress to the chest.
pulverised state among the corn, or they tie a bit the
size of a pea in a piece of linen, which they fasten to
the curb when the horse is harnessed, and the saliva
of the animal soon dissolves it. The sleek, round,
shining appearance of the carriage-horses, and especially
the much-admired foaming at the mouth, is the result
of this arsenic-feeding.* It is a common practice with
the farm-servants in the mountainous parts to strew a
pinch of arsenic on the last feed of hay before going up
a steep road. This is done for years without the least
unfavourable result; but should the horse fall into
the hands of another owner who withholds the arsenic,
he loses flesh immediately, is no longer lively, and even
with the best feeding there is no possibility of restoring
him to his former sleek appearance.
The above particulars, communicated by a contributor
residing in Germany, are curious only inasmuch as
they refer to poisons of a peculiarly quick and deadly

of confectionary. Arsenic is said by Dr Pearson to be
as harmless as a glass of wine in the quantity of one-
sixteenth part of a grain; and in the cure of agues it
is so certain in its effects, that the French Directory
once issued an edict ordering the surgeons of the
Italian army, under pain of military punishment, to
banish that complaint, at two or three days' notice,
from among the vast numbers of soldiers who were
languishing under it in the marshes of Lombardy. It
would seem that no poison taken in small and diluted
doses is immediately hurtful, and the same thing may
be said of other agents. The tap of a fan, for instance,
is a blow, and so is the stroke of a club; but the one
gives an agreeable sensation, and the other fells the
recipient to the ground. In like manner the analogy
holds good between the distribution of a blow over a
comparatively large portion of the surface of the body
and the dilution or distribution of the particles of a
poison. A smart thrust upon the breast, for instance,
with a foil does no injury; but if the button is
removed, and the same momentum thus thrown to a
point, the instrument enters the structures, and perhaps
causes death.
It is well to observe, that neither in these nor in
other poison-eaters is there the least trace of an
arsenic cachexy discernible; that the symptoms of a
chronic arsenical poisoning never shew themselves in
individuals who adapt the dose to their constitution,
even although that dose should be considerable. It is
not less worthy of remark, however, that when, either
from inability to obtain the acid, or from any other
cause, the perilous indulgence is stopped, symptoms of
illness are sure to appear, which have the closest
resemblance to those produced by poisoning from
arsenic. These symptoms consist principally in a
feeling of general discomfort, attended by a perfect
indifference to all surrounding persons and things,
great personal anxiety, and various distressing sensa-
tions arising from the digestive organs, want of appe-
tite, a constant feeling of the stomach being overloaded
at early morning, an unusual degree of salivation, a
burning from the pylorus to the throat, a cramp-like
movement in the pharynx, pains in the stomach, and
especially difficulty of breathing. For all these symp-
toms there is but one remedy-a return to the enjoy-
ment of arsenic.
According to inquiries made on the subject, it would
seem that the habit of eating poison among the inhabi-
tants of Lower Austria has not grown into a passion,
as is the case with the opium-eaters in the East, the
chewers of the betel nut in India and Polynesia, and of
the cocoa-tree among the natives of Peru. When once
commenced, however, it becomes a necessity.
In some districts sublimate of quicksilver is used in
the same way. One case in particular is mentioned
by Dr von Tschudi, a case authenticated by the English
ambassador at Constantinople, of a great opium-eater
at Brussa, who daily consumed the enormous quantity
of forty grains of corrosive sublimate with his opium.
In the mountainous parts of Peru the doctor met very
frequently with eaters of corrosive sublimate; and in
Bolivia the practice is still more frequent, where this
poison is openly sold in the market to the Indians.
In Vienna the use of arsenic is of every-day occur-
rence among horse-dealers, and especially with the
coachmen of the nobility. They either shake it in a
But the misfortune is, that poisons swallowed for
the sake of the agreeable sensations they occasion owe
this effect to their action upon the nervous system;
and the action must be kept up by a constantly in-
creasing dose till the constitution is irremediably
injured. In the case of arsenic, as we have seen, so
long as the excitement is undiminished all is apparently
well; but the point is at length reached when to
proceed or to turn back is alike death. The moment
the dose is diminished or entirely withdrawn, symptoms
of poison appear, and the victim perishes because he
has shrunk from killing himself. It is just so when
the stimulant is alcohol. The morning experience of
the drinker prophesies, on every succeeding occasion,
of the fate that awaits him. It may be pleasant to get
intoxicated, but to get sober is horror. The time comes,
however, when the pleasure is at an end, and the horror
alone remains. When the habitual stimulus reaches
its highest, and the undermined constitution can stand

no more, then comes the reaction. If the excitement
could go on ad infinitum, the prognosis would be different;
but the poison-symptoms appear as soon as the dose
can no longer be increased without producing instant
death, and the drunkard dies of the want of drink!
Many persons, it cannot be denied, reach a tolerable
age under this stimulus; but they do so only by taking
warning in time-perhaps from some frightful illness
-and carefully proportioning the dose to the sinking
constitution. 'I cannot drink now as formerly,' is a
common remark-sometimes elevated into the boast,
'I do not drink now as formerly.' But the relaxation
of the habit is compulsory; and by a thousand other
tokens, as well as the inability to indulge in intoxication,
the ci-devant drinker is reminded of a madness which
even in youth produced more misery than enjoyment,
and now adds a host of discomforts to the ordinary
fragility of age. As for arsenic-eating, we trust it will
never be added to the madnesses of our own country.
Think of a man deliberately condemning himself to
devour this horrible poison, on an increasing scale,
during his whole life, with the certainty that if at any
time, through accident, necessity, or other cause, he
holds his hand, he must die the most agonising of all
deaths! In so much horror do we hold the idea, that
we would have refrained from mentioning the subject
at all if we had not observed a paragraph making the
round of the papers, and describing the agreeable
phases of the practice without mentioning its shocking
results.
FIFTEEN THOUSAND AUTHORS AND THEIR
BOOK.*
MUCH of the charm which surrounded the Great Exhi-
bition may be attributed to the entirely unprecedented
character of the undertaking. The building and its
contents, wondrous as they were, owed a great part of
their popularity to the fact, that all was new. An
original and great idea had been successfully developed;
and a wondrous show was presented to the English
mind such as the world had never witnessed before.
This great affair has at last passed away: the building
indeed stands for the present; but its glory is gone
with its contents, and its interior, once as populous as
a city, and palatial in its decorations, is now a cold,
empty, and deserted glass-house. The great conception
has reached its accomplishment, so far as it had a local
connection with the Palace of Glass, and for its results
we shall no longer seek in Hyde Park, but in the com-
mercial and productive annals of our nation.
The Great Exhibition has but one literary offspring,
though many claim its parentage. This offspring is the
Official Catalogue, the career of which, by what perhaps
will seem a natural law, fairly commenced only with
the decease of its parent. This great book, gleaming
in blue and gold, and swelling to three portly volumes,
has a curious history, and, equally with the Exhibition
itself, may lay claim to a degree of novelty in its con-
ception and production which must long clothe it with
a peculiar attraction; and this even if its contents were
little better than those of an ordinary catalogue. If it
was a matter of wonder to one who once put the question
-how a literary partnership in the production of a book
of poetry was carried on: whether one author was top,
and the other bottom sawyer; whether one furnished
one line and the other its fellow-what would be his
surprise to hear of a book to which some 15,000 pens
have contributed, and in every page of which some ten
or twenty writers have had a hand! Here five-and-
twenty Frenchmen tell their tale at page 1207, while
at page 765 more than half that number of our own
countrymen tell theirs. At all events, such a book is
a phenomenon absolutely new in the literary world;
and apart from every consideration of its relation with
the Exhibition, and also of its scientific character and
commercial value, we propose giving an outline of its
history, regarding it-for the present-merely in the
light of a literary curiosity.
As this is a task which may occupy our attention
for some little space, it may be as well, on setting out,
to give the reader, what is perhaps much needed, a
clear and definite conception of what the work pro-
fesses to be, and of its relation to the smaller book, sold
at one shilling, and for a long time in everybody's hands
in the streets of London. That little fat book, in its
drab cover, with its densely-printed pages, looking
about as interesting as Walker's Dictionary, and scarcely
half as intelligible, which-though from no fault of its
own-few could understand, and scarcely anybody read:
that book was merely an index to the present work,
though it appeared first, and thus inverted the ordi-
nary rule. The small official catalogue, in fact, is a
highly-condensed summary of the larger work, gene-
rally dealing only with names, places, and things
exhibited, without any descriptive detail. This may
perhaps be best illustrated by a specimen from each
work, which we here append from Class 17, United
Kingdom :-

twopence was to be deducted, and surrendered to the
Royal Commissioners, for the general fund. In other
words, a volume of 320 pages was to be produced, and
sold at tenpence per copy, and a fine of L.50 per diem
was to be incurred if it made not its appearance
punctually on 1st May, with 10,000 copies ready for
sale. In addition to this work, authority was given
for the publication of a larger one, to contain illustra-
tions and detailed descriptions of the goods exhibited
-in short, a Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue.
No limit was affixed to the price of this work. Ad-
vertisements might be inserted in either. For the
privilege of publishing the small catalogue at a price
only just removed from a positive loss for every copy
sold, and for that of bringing out the present costly
work, a large purchase-money was expected-and ob-
tained. It appears from published accounts that the
sum of L.3200 was paid for the copyright of these
volumes! This part of the business settled, the task
of arranging the preliminaries for the collection of
the manuscripts of the 15,000 authors, and the plan of
proceeding when the contributions were received, formed
the next part of the history of the books.
The production of the plan of the present volumes,
and the idea of attaching elucidatory notes to the
descriptions of exhibiters, formed, as the preface assures
us, the task of the literary and scientific editor. On
receipt of the manuscripts of exhibiters, they were to
undergo a rude sort of preparation, intended merely to
divest them of obviously superfluous matter, and to
throw the manuscript into the conventional form intel-
ligible to the compositor. This effected, and the copy
set up in type, the whole was sent in the form known
asslip' to the editor, whose duty was the digestion,
classification, distribution, correction, reconstruction of
the raw material thus laid before him.
But we are going too fast. The manuscript had
first to be written. For this purpose, rules intended
for the guidance of the exhibiters-the authors-were
issued by the Executive Committee. These rules were
instructive and valuable in a high degree; and, had
they reached a full development, the work before us
would have assumed the very highest position in
science and literature. These rules were put into
circulation all over the United Kingdom and on the
continent-indeed wherever the post could carry them
in time. With them were circulated blank forms of
four kinds-blue, red, black, and yellow, appropriated
to the four sections-Raw Materials, Machinery, Manu-
factures, and Fine Arts. On these the exhibiter-authors
had to write the accounts of their articles; and thus
was produced the manuscript forming the crude
material of the present volumes. What heaps of
manuscript must have been thus produced - what
bushels or barrow-loads of written paper-for to mea-
sure this by folio and sheet is insanity-can be told
only by those to whom the mass was in due course
consigned the unfortunate printers.
With this material in type commence the next phase
and the most formidable of the difficulties attendant on
the production of the catalogue. The material had
passed from the compilers to the compositors, and from
the latter we now trace it to the editorial study. But
who was to edit this heap of incongruous material?—
a conglomerate of scraps dealing with every art and
science. Evidently no single individual was equal to
the performance of a duty at once so immense in its
character and so varied in its nature. This difficulty
had been foreseen: long prior to the receipt of the first
line of the work an army of scientific and practical
men had been mustered, the roll including some of the
highest names in natural and mechanical science. To
the separate care of each member of this corps the
dismembered fragments of the catalogue, systematically
cut to pieces, were duly forwarded. Now arose a fresh
difficulty-how were these pieces to be joined together
once more, and that in precisely the same order as at
first? For example, fragment No. 1 was off to the
continent; its next-door neighbour, No. 2, to the north
of Ireland; and No. 3 to Birmingham - each piece
being on the average not more than half-a-dozen lines
in length. No. 1 would be a week ere it returned,
No. 2 four or five days, and No. 3 at least three. Mean-
while hundreds of fresh fragments were being sent
out, and the daily post brought hundreds back in
return. The precise manner in which this formidable
difficulty was subdued, and the double end attained
of ensuring a competent and accurate revision and
correction, and the preservation of the sequential order
of the matter, has not been divulged. The editor
merely states that a simple plan was adopted which
accomplished all; and that, moreover, a precise register
of every fragment was kept of its destination, the
period of its transmission by post, and of its return;
and so accurately did this plan work, that the acci-
dental detention of a little piece only three lines long
was immediately discovered, and every particular of its
history fully known! A polite request for its imme-
diate return apprised the annotator of the vigilant
care which watched over these little scraps of paper
-in themselves so worthless-yet each telling its
industrial tale.
Let us suppose the material thus purified from most of
its scientific and technical inaccuracies, a vast amount
of literary labour remained to be accomplished. Let
the reader conceive the infinite variety of style, literary
construction, and expression inevitably resulting from
the very nature of the material and its origin. Mr A.,
who exhibited an amazing species of blacking, would-
may we say, did?-dilate in strains comparable to,
though at a little interval behind, those of a famous
poet of metropolitan celebrity. Yet Mr A.'s blacking
was a good article, a capital industrial product, and on
no account to be despised because it was something
attached to everyday life: quite the contrary. It was
not fair to omit everything Mr A. said the blacking
would accomplish, yet what it would really effect was
so enveloped in figures of speech as scarcely to admit
of disentanglement. This must, however, be done, and
it was done. Mr A.'s rhetoric on blacking was only
a type of Mr B.'s on boots, or Mr C.'s on soap. Indeed
it is very probable that the hairdressers, bootmakers,
and others who exhibited,' contributed more in the
matter of literary composition than any other class
of exhibition authors. It can scarcely, however, be
deemed a matter of regret that there is little trace of
this in the work before us, where all those exhibiters
speak in very staid and demure terms of their several
products. Thus far for the puffery.
The variety of literary style and expression formed a
far more intractable feature of this undertaking. It
proved a remarkable fact in the history of the prepara-
tion of the work, that in a large number of instances
those exhibiters who were the producers of the most
meritorious objects, were precisely those who said
least about them. To such an extent was this the
case, that it became actually necessary to invite such
exhibiters to send further details for the due balancing
of a work which at one time threatened to be over-
whelmed with commonplace. This seems to have
proved effectual; and few cases can now be pointed
out of insufficient description attached to deserving
objects. When from various causes, which it is easy to
conjecture, the descriptions sent still proved inadequate,
they were extended, or received the addition of an
explanatory note. The formation of sentences, the
right selection of terms, and all the other things to be
attended to in literary composition, had all to be
done here; and an endeavour has been made, with a
moderate degree of success, to reduce to a harmonious
whole this anomalous and incongruous heap of literary
material. Just as varies the handwriting of every

individual, so, though in a lesser degree, will be found
to vary what is well understood as the 'style' of every
writer. Let it be also remembered that a consider-
able amount of the manuscript was forwarded by that
large and meritorious class of exhibiters-artisans, and
in its grammatical and orthographical construction was
consequently full of internal evidence of its humble
origin.
also the vulgar and common terms of many of those
things which have hitherto been familiar to him in the
dignified though less expressive designations of science.
On another occasion we may again advert to these
volumes, and present a few extracts from their contents.
For the present we have adhered to our original in-
tention, and considered the work merely in its inte-
resting character as one of the curiosities of literature.
It would be unfair to conclude without stating, since
the fact is not mentioned in the title, that the editor-

These difficulties, great as they must have proved,
were trifling in comparison with one which still
remains to be adverted to-the queer literary produc-in-chief is Mr Robert Ellis of Sloane Street.
tions of the foreign exhibiters. This will be best
understood by considering the difficulty of translating
technical terms into their English equivalents. As an
example, something of the following description might
have to be dealt with:-This lamp is at present time
in the public domain. The simpleness of its Mechanism
got over a noted preference upon the lamp, the
name of which will ever be illustrious. It produces the
same result exactly than that latter, but it affords not
so much difficulties as so its Cleansing and repairing.
Its immense success already occupies several important
manufactures, but which are rather more inclined so
sell a very low prices than having a good manufactur-
ing. With that respect, M. the first and un-
equalled french lamp Manufacturer, may be ever highly
commended for the rightly-acquired fame of his pro-
ducts!!'
Or, again, what would the reader make out of a gild-
ing-fluid which might be described as 'allying very well
with reserved parts to imitate wood?' Or how should
such a statement as the following be dealt with:-
'Creator of my manufactory in 1830, being by
myself a—, I have always worked in a line of ame-
lioration and of improvement, all the models of my
productions, united in my warehouses, are established
conscientiously; and of the best quality my only desire,
being to arrive to an honourable result.'
The grammatical entanglement of a foreigner's trans-
lation of his description of a piece of machinery-a
mule for cotton-spinning, for example, or an agricul-
tural implement-can perhaps scarcely be conceived.
It is easy to imagine the multitude of ludicrous mis-
takes which would thus arise, and the appearance of
which in the work would have destroyed its value and
character. Even were all correct, the foreign idiom
must have been invariably preserved, and an extensive
transposition of words in every second or third sentence
would become necessary.
However, after alterations and corrections to an
alarming extent, the book was actually got to press,
part by part; and having struggled through every
difficulty, it now appears complete in a handsome form.
Its delay is explained in the preface as the result of an
accumulation of corrections and alterations of various
kinds, many of which were made by a few out of the
15,000 who sat down to write the work. The smaller
catalogue was rapidly made up from the corrected
sheets of the larger one; and while the latter were
obliged to lie inactive for awhile if undergoing a
dreadful process of docking can be so called the
smaller book was seen in every nook and alley of the
Great Exhibition.
The career of the smaller work ended just prior to
the close of the Exhibition, when the present, perfect
in all its parts, appeared. A wide and honourable
field of scientific and commercial utility appears likely
to be occupied by this great work. We have often
been struck with the fact, that commercial men in but
few instances have perceived the relation of science to
commerce. In this work it is shewn in a manner not
likely to be soon forgotten.
The merchant may here learn the locality, the pro-
bable supply, and, in many instances, the scientific
synonymes of those substances in the sale of which he
is so deeply concerned; and the philosopher may learn
Nor least extraordinary among the results of the
gold-discovery in California is the new social relation-
ship or intermixture of races which, already com-
menced, will doubtless go on to some interesting
developments. We were aware that the immense and
crowded population of China had, under the present
dynasty, begun fairly to overflow its bounds, and that
already colonies of Celestials had planted themselves in
the Indian Archipelago. We were not prepared, how-
ever, to hear of new tribes of emigrants from the same
country floating across the North Pacific; and yet such
is the fact, as appears by an account just received
from a writer in San Francisco. The Chinese,' he
says, 'are destined to exercise an important influence
in this country. For the last six months they have
supplied a larger number of immigrants than any
other nation not excepting the Atlantic section of
the Union. Scarcely a week clapses without the arrival
of 150 or 200 Celestials. Very few of them forsake the
country; they appear to shape their course for perma-
nent residence. The greater number equip themselves
for mining, and set off in quest of gold; but many
have settled down in trade or business in this city.
The various grades of society are well represented;
many of them are labourers and rustics, while some
appear to be educated and polished. They all hail
from Canton: it would not be creditable to come
from any other place.
-
'It is a curious fact that, although there are from
10,000 to 20,000 of these people in California, very few
of them are females. The women do not come: I
know of but two or three Chinese women in this city.
One of them is the noted Miss Atoy-a distinguished
character, who has no pretensions to beauty, though
she is not homely. She lives in a very public place,
and shews herself at the door - always in regular
national costume- - with Chinese pantaloons of pure
white or highly-wrought satin.
'You cannot look into the streets but you see troops
of Chinese- here a dozen marching in single file,
irregularly, and making a tour of observation, noting
with curiosity everything around them. Yonder is
another troop, twenty or thirty more, laden with tin
pans, boots, and various preparations for the mines.
Still larger bodies may be seen with sacks of sugar and
rice on their backs, carrying them to their storehouses
after the manner of ants; or if the load be too heavy
for one, two of them tug it on a pole. There is a chap
with a huge basket of clothing, at the heels of an
odd-looking genius who wears odd-looking spectacles,
and who reads his book as he goes to find the proper
stopping - places. Occasionally you behold fifty or a
hundred in one gang, just arrived, and staring with
amazement at everything, getting along about as fast
as children going to school on a parade-day.
"The Chinese are slow in assuming the American
costume. Their clumsy shoes first come off, and are
replaced by boots, often much too large. They are
fond of big boots, and will seldom submit to a good fit
if they can get a pair of greater capacity for the same
money. Their feet are generally small. A friend of
mine had a stock of small boots that he did not know

house is crammed, like their other quartering-places,
with hundreds of trunks and bundles, and with various
kinds of merchandise. The merchants mostly remain
in their stores, waiting for the visits of customers.
Some small traders hawk their wares from door to
door. They are equal to the Yankees in driving a
bargain, and their economy is undoubted. It is said
that they can out-trick the Yankees in trade, in proof
of which specimens of tea made of dead wood are
exhibited. It is even said that they can transform
linen shirts into excellent calico ones in the process of
washing and ironing. When a customer calls they
exhibit wonderful expertness in comprehending his
wants and arranging a bargain: but the tax-collector
avers that he cannot by any possible means make
them understand the object of his visit.
They are very temperate, and a Chinaman is
scarcely ever known to be drunk or noisy in the
streets. In their houses they make merry with music
and dancing. They are fond of smoking cigaritos, and
are growing in civilisation fast enough to smoke in the
streets.
'On a Sabbath morning lately I entered their estab-
lishment in Clay Street, and found some twenty of
them sitting on the boxes, quietly occupied in sewing
bags of buckskin for gold-dust. They were evidently
unskilled in the art. One of the party wore a thimble,
and others had a rag tied on the finger instead. I
was shewing one of them how to do his work better,
when another stepped up to shew me his work, which
was neatly done. He was highly gratified with my
approbation.
Their ironing is done with a smooth-bottomed
skillet filled with live coals, which is moved over the
fabric by means of the handle in the same way that a
warming-pan is used. One of them found a vest that
he was ironing to be too dry; whereupon, filling his
mouth with water, he sputtered it over the garment
with wonderful dexterity. Each ironing - table is
supplied with a bowl of water for this purpose.'
The writer then hazards a conjecture, that after the
men have established a home they will send for their
wives; but this betrays an ignorance of the Chinese
law, which prohibits women from being taken out of
It appears that the more the diggings are extended,
the more of the precious metal is discovered: the
value of the quantity collected and to be collected
within the present year, is estimated at 100,000,000 of
dollars-or L.20,000,000 sterling. The mines of Russia
have hitherto been the most productive; but their yield
of L.4,000,000 annually is now exceeded fivefold by
that of California. Unexpected returns have been
obtained from several mills lately set up to crush
the quartz rock by water-power; one of them is said
to give a net profit of 100 dollars per hour.' It
is calculated that the auriferous deposits cannot be
exhausted in 1000 years.
Owing to the fact, that gold is not used in China as
currency in any form, or in the payment of dues or
taxes, none of the metal can be sent to that country
without incurring a positive loss. On the other hand,
at New York gold is worth 18 dollars an ounce,
while in California it is not worth more than 16
dollars; consequently a large profit is realised by the
mere sending of it from one side of the American con-
tinent to the other. The prices of vegetables at San
Francisco and the diggings are, as reported, almost
fabulous: potatoes, 16 dollars a bushel; turnips and
onions, 25 to 62 cents each; eggs, from 10 to 12
dollars a dozen. Wood is so scarce that coal is burnt,
which costs from 60 to 100 dollars per ton; and it is
supposed that a good trade may be established for the
coal of Vancouver's Island and our Australian colonies.
Pine boards and timber, locally termed lumber,' sold
at one time at from 300 to 600 dollars per 1000 feet;
but the price is now 85 dollars, and, with wages at 15
dollars a day, it cannot be produced in the country for
less. The lumber-merchants of the eastern states con-
sequently hope to do a good trade in this commodity:
they can supply the wood at 16 dollars per 1000 feet, and
the freight will be 24 dollars, making the cost less than
half that of the Californian pine. The demand for
lumber for several years to come is estimated at
20,000,000 feet annually. When all the arrangements
are complete, it is intended that the passage from the
Atlantic to the Pacific ports shall not occupy more
than 20 days-thus, New York to Chagres, 7 days; the
Isthmus, 3 days; Panama to San Francisco, 10 days.
Meantime sailing-vessels have made the voyage by
way of Cape Horn in from 90 to 100 days: the route
recommended is to stand broad off from the Horn, so
as to get beyond the currents and baffling airs near the
land, and within the influence of the south-east and
north-west trade-winds. By this means the voyage
from the Cape to San Francisco may often be per-
formed in less time than from Panama to the same
place.
It appears further, that California is remarkable for
some other natural phenomena besides gold. Many
singular petrifactions have been met with on different
parts of the coast; and in the Bay of San Francisco
there are standing petrified trees, to which boats are

not unfrequently made fast at low-water-all indicating
a volcanic origin. The same cause is still at work in
what are called the 'Pluton Geysers'—that is, the hot
springs of the Valley of the Pluton. These have lately
been visited and examined by Mr Shepherd, professor
of geology in Ohio, who relates that after exploring
the Napa Valley for a distance of 30 miles, he came
with his party to a group of 20 springs, varying in
temperature from 93 to 169 degrees, although lying
within a space of half a mile square. What is more
remarkable, the temperature of individual springs
changes considerably in the course of a few weeks,
becoming cold or intensely hot. The professor felt
desirous to find the spot where the intensity of this
action would be greatest, and pursued his exploration.
To quote his own words:
'We travelled north-westerly from the head of Napa
Valley, and after encamping one or two nights in the
rain, and wandering through almost impenetrable
thickets, reached the summit of a high peak on the
morning of the fourth day. On the west we saw the
vast Pacific; on the east, the lofty range of the Sierra
Nevada; while on the north, almost immediately at
our feet, there opened an immense chasm, apparently
formed by the rending of the mountains in a direction
from west to east. The sun's rays had already pene-
trated into the narrow valley, and so lighted up the
deep defile that from a distance of four or five miles
we distinctly saw clouds and dense columns of steam
rapidly rising from the banks of the little river Pluton.
It was now the 8th of February: the mountain-peaks
in the distance were covered with snow, while the
valley at our feet wore the verdant garb of summer.
It was with difficulty we could persuade ourselves that
we were not looking down upon some manufacturing
city, such as Pittsburg or Wheeling, until by a tortuous
descent we arrived at the spot where at once the
secrets of the inner world opened upon our astonished
senses. In the space of half a mile square we discovered
from 100 to 200 openings through which the steam
issued with violence, sending up dense columns to a
height of nearly 200 feet, like our largest ocean-
steamers, and gradually diminishing to engines of one
or two horse-power. The roar of the larger tubes
could be heard for a mile or more.'
6
Some of these jets work 'spasmodically,' and when
least expected, drench the incautious traveller with
scalding water. The mineral and earthy matters held
in suspension have formed cones over some of the
orifices, the interior of which appears to be immense
boiling caldrons, and you hear the lashing and foaming
gyrations beneath your feet as you approach them. It
is then a moment of intense interest. Curiosity impels
you forward-fear holds you back; and while you
hesitate, the thin crust under your feet gives way, and
you find yourself sinking into the fiery mälström below.'
Here also the quality and temperature of the springs
close together vary greatly-from boiling-point down
to icy cold-and furnishing an abundant variety of
mineral waters, with 'every natural facility for vapour,
shower, or plunge baths. Where the heated sul-
phuretted hydrogen gas is evolved, water appears to
be suddenly formed, beautiful crystals of sulphur depo-
sited, and more or less sulphuric acid generated. In
some places the acid was found so strong as to turn
black kid - gloves almost immediately to a deep red.
Notwithstanding that the rocks and earth in
many places are so hot as to burn your feet through
the soles of your boots, there is yet no appearance of a
volcano in this extraordinary spot. Were the action
to cease, it would be difficult after a few years to per-
suade men that it ever existed. The rocks around you
are rapidly dissolving under the powerful metamorphic
action going on. Porphyry and jasper are transformed
into a kind of potter's clay; granite is rendered so
soft that you may crush it between your fingers and
cut it as easily as bread unbaked; and feldspar appears
to be converted partly into alum.'
The action of heat on wood was also strikingly exhi-
bited in stumps of trees silicified, and others converted
into lignite or brown coal. This fact perhaps may help
to explain the occurrence of silicified wood in Van
Diemen's Land, which has often proved a puzzle to
geologists. There were also some drops of a very
dense and highly refractive fluid;' and Professor
Shepherd 'was led to believe that pure carbon might,
under such circumstances, crystallise and form the
diamond.' Unfortunately he lost the specimen in his
attempt to secure it.
The effect produced on living vegetation is thus
described: A green tree cut down and obliquely
inserted in one of the conical mounds was so changed
in thirty-six hours that its species would not have been
recognised except from the portion projecting outside,
around which beautiful crystals of sulphur had already
formed.'
The heated and sulphurous vapours have no injurious
effect on the vegetation of the locality, for large forest-
trees flourish within fifty feet of the boiling springs,
animals abound in the thickets, and birds sing in the
branches.
Professor Shepherd thus concludes: 'I have now
traced the influence of this thermal action from 200 to
300 miles on the Pacific coast to California, but only
in this place have I been permitted to witness its
astonishing intensity. The metamorphic action going
on is at this moment effecting important changes in
the structure and conformation of the rocky strata. It
is not stationary, but apparently moving slowly east-
ward in the Pluton Valley.' He considers that if the
cause of action be carefully studied, the result will be
to throw light on many geological phenomena at
present inexplicable.

-SPENSER.
BUT great bonfires' and 'merry feasting,' however
much indulged in in Devonshire, are not needed to
the end that one should not the cold remember,' for
winter on England's sweet south-western coast is not
like that season in other places. In South Devon,
tender shrubs, which in most counties are stripped of
their leaves in October, remain verdant till late in the
winter. I have seen the new spring-leaves spreading
their tender green, and flower-buds formed on the
branches of the rose-tree, whilst those of the former
year still retained their green as they hung unshaken
on their stalks. Fuchsias, geraniums, and the eccre-
mocarpus, whose delicate leaves are so soon touched
by frost, continue to bloom till long after Christmas,
and in very mild winters even as late as March; whilst
many exotics, which in other counties would not sur-
vive December without the protection of a greenhouse,
will stand winter after winter in the open ground
without even the protection of matting, and attain size
and strength unknown to the inhabitants of a green-
house. When, therefore, I speak of finding flowers in
the field after their usual season is past, do not let it be
considered as a myth, but look on it-as it is of a truth
rather as a result of that sweet, genial climate with
which it has pleased God to endow our southern coast,

making it thereby so comfortable and beneficial a
retreat for those poor consumptive beings who would
be unable to bear the cold blasts of winter in a less
favourable position, and whereby so many lives have
been prolonged and so much suffering mitigated.
But now, as I mean to take a long round through
the lanes, and to bring home such wealth of berries as
never was seen, I really must have George and the
donkey: the former to climb the hedges and collect the
spoil, and the latter to help to bring it home when
collected. The flower-fancier who lives by the sea-
shore has several great advantages over one who lives
in an inland situation, because there are many plants
which love saline particles, and flourish within their
influence, but do not exist where those particles are
not to be found; yet he has one marked disadvantage:
the person who lives in an inland position forms
the centre of a circle of as many miles of land as he
can traverse, and therefore has about twice as much
field for his observation as the sea-shore collector,
inasmuch as the circle of the latter is half composed of
sea, an element on which he can find no food for his
fancy. Remember, I do not say the botanist, but the
flower collector; for of course he who studies the
marine plants does not come under my remark. Now
this circumstance must account for my so often leading
my friends at the outset of our walk or ride in the same
direction at Budleigh Salterton there are but two
roads by which you may quit the village--one leading
to Sidmouth, and the other to Exmouth; and though
these soon branch off into other roads and lanes, so as
to provide an abundant variety of walks, there is neces-
sarily a little monotony in the commencement of our
rambles.
"
Mounted on Jack, and with George, my trusty
knight, by my side, we therefore set off once more up
the village, along by the blacksmith's glowing shop,
and so over the heath to the Exmouth road, because
there grow the finest hollies of all in that holly-decked
neighbourhood; and as Christmas is drawing near, I
propose getting a rare stock of its bright berries, as
well as those of other kinds, for the decoration of my
rooms: not for the reason assigned by Brand, for
decking houses with evergreens in December that
the sylvan spirits might repair to them, and remain
unnipped by frost and cold winds until a milder season
had renewed the foliage of their darling abodes,' but
because I love old customs-at least all harmless ones
-and because I love and would cultivate cheerfulness;
and though living now alone, I see not why my house
should not look as bright, and I be as happy, as my
neighbours indeed, the house of the solitary needs the
help of such external influences to enliven it, even more
than that of the family where there are bright young
faces all beaming with Christmas joy, and all sorts of
social greetings between old and young and middle-
aged, to cheer a family circle. And so I set forward,
resolved that my house should be very gay, and that in
berries at any rate I would outvie my neighbours.
And now we have entered on the scene of our gather-
ings, and there are trees refulgent with berries, and of
a size not often surpassed. At first they appear only
here and there, but about a mile from the village the
hedge on the right hand is chiefly formed of holly, and
large trees of it, some twenty feet or more in height,
stand out at intervals in all the pride of beauty. For
how many long years has the holly been the theme of
song and praise! How many years has it been in repute
as a Christmas ornament! Certainly it had attained
this pre-eminence before the English language arrived
at its present orthography, for there exists an old carol
or ballad in the Harleian collection at the British
Museum which curiously contrasts it with the ivy,
putting the latter into a most lamentable position.
Nevertheless, the much- despised ivy shall have its
'honour due,' both in our houses and in my botanical
record.
The common ivy (Hédera hélix) is of the natural
order Caprifoliacea-the name is supposed to be derived
from the Celtic hedra, a cord. Incredible as it may
seem to the ordinary observer, there is but one species
of this tribe indigenous in England; and indeed the
whole genus boasts but two species, unless we consider
the Irish ivy (Hedera hélix vegéta), which is a native of
Madeira, as one. In appearance, however, there are
two English species: one which runs over walls, trees,
and ruins, sending out large branches crowned with
blossoms and berries, and forming woody stems as
thick or thicker than the wrist, with leaves egg-shaped
and sharply pointed, of one clear green; and another
not half the size of the former, the leaves of which
are five-lobed, and veined with white, their colour varied
with purple, bronze, and even yellow and red: it
grows close to the wall, or trunk of the tree on which
it spreads, and produces neither blossoms nor berries.'
But these are merely varieties of the same species, the
apparent differences proceeding from the accidents of
soil and situation; and this may be proved by taking a
bit of the root of the larger sort, and placing it close to
a wall or tree, where you will soon see it assume the
growth and appearance of the smaller sort, and continue
to maintain it until it rises to a height where there is
no substance on which it can fix the numerous fibres
thrown out from the stems: it will then begin to alter
its character, become woody and branched, and throw
out blossoms; the leaves will also assume the undivided
form and the uniform green which marks the larger
sort.
The ivy blossom appears in October or November.
It is formed with five stamens, one pistil, and five
small oblong petals. The flowers are in umbels, and
produce one-celled berries, which when ripe, and that is
about April, are black and very handsome. I am not
aware that it has any medicinal properties, neither is it
good for the food of man; yet in it we may remark a
gracious provision for the benefit of some of the lower
animals. When the hawthorn and other berries which
have supplied the blackbirds and other feathered deni-
zens of the wild with food during the winter are nearly
exhausted, and the summer fruits are not yet ripened,
there comes in an abundant crop of ivy berries; and
this is not all, for at the close of the flower season, when
the 'sedulous bees' can find but little to supply their
wants, the sweet blossoms of the ivy expand, and then
around every ivy-crowned bridge and wall you may
hear the air all vocal with the busy hum of these pretty
honey-gatherers, who cluster among the blossoms by
hundreds. Pigeons, blackbirds, thrushes, and other
birds rejoice in the berries, and the stumps of ivy
form a favourite building-place for blackbirds and some
other kinds. Sheep are also very fond of its leaves
therefore ivy shall not stond without the dore ful sore
There was no frost, no snow; the leaves still lingered
on the hedges, a few here and there tinged with those
deepest shades of red and purple and bronze which
precede their final departure; but many more than
remain on the branches lie in heaps under the hedge
and on the bank; and as you pass along, hundreds of
small birds spring up from their feast of hips and haw-
thorn-berries-startling you with their sudden flight as
they mount-and then alight on some bush a little
farther on to resume their chirping and their food.
And then on some twig close to you, and in full sight,
sweet Robin sits and sings, wholly unscared by the
sight of human beings, his bright orange-red breast
having attained its full winter richness, and looking
almost as brilliant as the holly-berries on the neigh-acold.'

leaves glittering in the sunshine, and the birdies'
glancing about among them between the branches.
But the finest bunches are too high, and far above my
reach. What shall I do?-for I had set my mind on
gathering for myself. Why I must remount Jack,
and perhaps by getting him in close under the tree, and
it may be a little way up the bank, I may succeed in
reaching those splendid branches. So Jack was pushed,
and pulled, and pommelled about, until he had at last
assumed the position required; and then up I got, but,
alas! I had miscalculated, for my head was not very
much higher than before, and all the most glowing
branches preserved their beauties intatto!
'I can climb up easy, ma'am,' said George; and
before I could reply with consent or denial, George
was crashing through the branches and dry leaves on
the top of the hedge.
'Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing
object of the kind than an impregnable fence of near
three hundred foot in length, nine foot high, and five
in diameter, which I can shew in my poor garden, at
any time of the year, glittering with its armed and
varnished leaves? the taller standards at orderly
distances blushing with their natural coral. It mocks
at the rudest assaults of the weather, beasts, or hedge-
breakers, "et illum nemo impune lacessit."'
He then proceeds to give many important directions
for the growth and culture of hollies, and adds: 'This
rare hedge-the boast of my villa-was planted upon
a burning gravel exposed to the meridian sun.' But
there seems to have been a hedge in the grounds of
Sir M. Decker, at Richmond, which even surpassed
Evelyn's in grandeur. This plant which never
looks more beautiful than when its brilliant green
foliage and coral-berries are breaking through a mantle
of lustrous snow-presents many cultivated varieties:
one with yellow berries, and another with a silvery
edging to its leaves, but none of them equal in beauty
the common red prickly holly, a sprig of which is the
badge of the clan Drummond. It is called in Gaelic
Creil Thionn.
'And now, George,' said I, as we worked our way
through Knowle, 'where can we get some butcher's
broom?'
"O there's plenties, maam, at Haye's 'ood, but I
doant know for any handier nor that,' was George's
reply.
And how far is Haye's Wood from hence?' asked I.
"They do call 't about a maile and half here from,'
answered George in his broad Devonshire dialect,
wherein we have almost continental pronunciation
of some vowels, and wonderful clipping of others,
with such strange inversions of personal and pos-
sessive pronouns as are, I believe, unknown in other
lands.
'Not that tree, George,' cried I, seeing him begin
to ascend one whose berries were not of so brilliant a
red as its neighbour - for be it known that there is
great diversity in their hue, some trees bearing much
duller berries than others-Not that; the next;' and
George, obedient though ardent, was presently aloft
in the one indicated, lopping off such branches, all one
glow of scarlet, that soon there lay at my feet enough
to clothe Jack in a bristly panoply from head to foot.
And now my purveyor having descended from the tree
-not wholly unscathed though, for it is ill climbing in
a holly-bush-we jog on through Knowle, and as we go,
we may amuse ourselves with talking over the holly,
its structure and properties. Be it known, then, that
though China, Carolina, Madeira, and other countries
boast of numerous species of this plant, which is of the
natural order Celastrineæ, in Britain there is only one
indigenous to the land, and that is the common holly
(Ilex aquifolium), although there have been several
varieties produced by culture from this species. The
main characteristics of all, however, are alike. The
bark is grayish; the leaves alternate, shining, and Then you must get me some to-morrow, George,'

cells, in each of which is one oblong, pointed seed, holly, and hips and haws, the banks here and there

among the fallen leaves, from whence the young plants scabious, or St John's wort, and occasionally a pink

fences, the prickly leaves render it invaluable, although profuse abundance, and highly ornamental they are
its slow growth is a disadvantage; the wood is much to the country all through the autumn and winter;
in repute with turners, as it is very hard, white, and they are the fruit of the Iris fætidissima, one of the
close-grained, presenting a beautiful surface. It is only two species which are indigenous in our own land;
much used in mosaic or inlaying work, and is also for though there are so many gorgeous varieties which
put under thin plates of ivory, to render the latter add to the decoration of our gardens, they are all
more brilliant. Birdlime is made of the bark, its imports from other countries the common yellow-

Evelyn states that the superior leaves, dried to a fine sorry to write, because, though most appropriate, it is
powder, and drunk in white wine, are good for one so inelegant-the stinking iris (I. fætidissima), being
complaint, and the most pointed, mixed and boiled our only two native kinds. They belong to the natural
with other matters, for several others; and also that a order Iridoa. The very name of iris denotes beauty,
dozen of the ripe berries being swallowed would disperse being bestowed by the ancients from the variety of its
phlegm without danger; but these, I suspect, were some colours. Loudon says: According to Plutarch, the
of the notions of an age less advanced in medical know-word iris signified, in the ancient Egyptian tongue, eye
ledge than the present, for Woodville in his Medical
Botany takes no notice of the holly. Evelyn was an
enthusiast in holly, and had a most noble hedge of it in
his garden at Deptford, on which he thus expatiates:

bow. One of the foreign species (Iris germanica), a
native of Germany, produces that sweet, violet-scented
article the orris - root a corruption of iris - root-

which is sold in shops as a dentifrice, and for other
uses; but one of our English kinds (Ï. pseudo acorus)
seems to have more valuable properties than any other
I find reported. The root of this is said to be good
for toothache, besides having other medical uses, and
being also used in the Hebrides to dye black. The
leaves make excellent thatch and chair-bottoms; and
Dr George Johnstone says that the berries roasted are
an admirable substitute for coffee. It is common in
marshy places and wet fields in June.
The form of the blossom is like that of all irises, with
six divisions, the three inner much shorter than the
three outer: this, the yellow-flag, grows from two to
four feet in height, throwing up from a fine group of
dark-green sword-shaped leaves its long flower-stalks,
each with three blossoms, which expand one after the
other, and are of a bright yellow. The other species
(Iris fætidissima) is less common than the former: it is
found most abundantly in all the south-western coun-
ties of England, but is rare elsewhere, and not met with
at all in Scotland. Hooker says, and most truly, in
Devonshire it is so frequent that you can hardly avoid
walking among it when herborising, and being annoyed
by the smell; and Withering tells us that it has a
smell like rancid bacon.' Decidedly the odour which
exhales from any cut or bruised part is most offensive,
and almost enough to deter one from venturing to
assail it; but, luckily, it does not continue long; and
after it has once subsided it does not return unless you
macerate it anew, so that the flower or capsule may
be used in the decoration of a room with impunity. It
is in form like all the rest of its tribe; the colour of the
blossom which appears in June is a dull grayish purple;
in growth it is smaller and lower than the yellow-flag;
it prefers dry soil, and is abundant on the limestone
hills near Torquay, where it looks very brilliant-rising
in tufts among the great boulders of limestone, which
crop up between the short thymy turf on those beauti-
ful heights. Its great beauty, however, lies in its
abundant fruit, which, forming about July, lies closed
up in its large three-lobed calyx of deep green till
towards winter, when the segments of the calyx begin
to divide, and display at each of the three openings a
double row of round yellow berries, very smooth, and
as large as a pea, shewing that each capsule encloses
six rows of seeds with about six or seven in each row:
as they mature the sepals open wider, and the berries
deepen in colour until they attain a bright orange-red;
so that during November and December they present
a very beautiful appearance. Three or four of these
masses of berries hang on each stalk, depressing it by
their weight into a graceful curve; as winter advances
the calyx becomes stiff and brown, and turns back
towards the stem, contrasting well with the bright
coral-seeds which it thus discloses more fully; so that
till quite spring they continue to be singular and
attractive objects, and greatly enliven the wintry
colouring of the hedge or hillside.
Laden with spoils, we now passed along through lanes
lovely even at this season of the year; my donkey
from time to time stopping unreproved to crop the
herbage by the roadside, or to browse on some of the
few plants in the hedge which Dame Winter had spared.
I like donkeys in spite of their proverbial dulness
and stubbornness; for which faults of character, by the
by, I often think man is more blamable than the poor
maligned beast. Why should not the breed be im-
provable by proper care as well as that of the noble
Andalusian and Egyptian animals, which are, I believe,
of the same race as our own? Donkeys are picturesque
objects in a landscape; and a nice group of shaggy
animals, with a fine foal or two, has not unfrequently
formed a subject, and a pleasing one, for the painter,
while even poets have not left the tribe wholly untouched
in their songs.
And now we turn into a pretty sort of terrace-lane-
if lane that may be called which has a hedge only on
one side, the other being formed by a sudden fall of
some feet-to a sweet, green meadow, at the end of
which is a pretty overshot rustic mill. Beyond it lie
orchards beautiful in spring, when carpeted with prim-
roses and hyacinths, and overhung with rosy apple-
blossoms; through these orchards and the meadow
flows the clear little stream which works the mill,
and speedily joins our path, by the side of which it
courses along till we reach Kersbrook. Soon we find
ourselves descending the steep, steep hill which leads
from the Sidmouth road into the village, and from the
top of which we seem to look down into the chimneys
of the houses, so abrupt is its descent. But then the
wide view of the sea which it commands is so entrancing
that, watching the blue waters, we forget the hill, and
suddenly find that we are close to the terrace and
almost at home.
And here, for the present, I close my rambling
observations on wild-flowers.
FRENCH COTTAGE COOKERY.*
MADAME MIAU often expressed her astonishment that
we English, who are so fond of having everything good,
and spare neither pains nor expense in improvements,
had never yet penetrated into the mystery of fattening
fowls. Not but that they are sometimes white, and
good, and fat, although small; but to have them so,
sacristie! what a price you pay! and, after all, look at
the difference between a fine French poularde and one
of the best of your "leetl' beasts."'
"And in what consists the mystery?' I asked.
wheat, and new milk—voilà tout.
'No mystery at all: darkness, cleanliness, buck-
If the milk is many
hours milked, so as to be the least idea sour, give it to
your children, but not to your capons: let the place
they are confined in be perfectly dark, and let it be
thoroughly cleaned once if not twice a day: the buck-
wheat must not be in the slightest degree damaged :
feed them yourself four times in the twenty-four hours
with a paste of flour and new milk, just stiff enough
to roll into the thickness of a worm, and in a fortnight
or three weeks you will have tout ce qu'il y a de mieux.
If you choose to cram them, you come on quicker.'
'But how cruel not to let them drink!'
'Ah, bah! they don't mind that; but I can't think,
however, a little fresh-drawn milk by itself sometimes
will hinder their fattening: they must positively, how-
ever, have nothing else.'
'I thought,' observed I, 'that the geese in France
were as inferior to ours as the fowls were the contrary.'
"Then you never were at Cherbourg le jour des
rois?'
'No.'
'I was once, and the geese live still in my memory:
so white, so smooth, so fat-like English babies; and
when you touched them with a fork in roasting, ah,
the lovely sea of grease that flowed!'
'Disgusting! What can you do with it?'
Mme Miau stared, and it was evident that to her the
well-fed fleshy goose, stuffed with onions and sage, so
dear to the inhabitants of Durham, was unknown; so I
begged her to proceed with the cookery of her goose,
which she did as follows:- Never baste your goose,
but when the dripping-pan fills, empty it; continuing
to do so again and again till it has run all out, and
the animal is roasted: then, while still hot, detach

the legs and wings; wait until they are cold, or better,
till next day, when you must carefully place them one
above the other, and a laurel leaf upon each, in a stone
jar, till it is quite full; remelt the grease, and pour it
over all. The bodies are only fit to fricassée for the
poor.'
'And how do you eat the legs and wings?'
'In various ways: grill and serve with sauce à la
moutarde, or make a haricot, or stew them with bouillon,
butter, turnips, and seasoning-in fine, what you will.'
The following dish also seemed to me new, and as
there is no accounting for tastes, it may possibly be
liked by those fond of traditions, as it is recorded that
St Hubert ate the hares he killed, cooked according to
this very jovial récipé.
Hare à la St Hubert.- Skin it while quite warm,
and cut it up as quickly as possible; put it into a
copper, with all the blood you can save; four ounces
of bacon fat, leeks, parsley, a bay leaf, and whatever
herbs you can most quickly procure, made into a
bundle; add a sufficiency of salt, a very little pepper,
and lastly, a pint-and-a-half- of good, strong, spirituous
red wine. Hook the copper on the pot-hanger-in
France, as in Scotland, there is always a hook hung
in the chimney to fasten the marmite to, high above
the fire; I suppose the hob answers the purpose,
or might do so, in England-and set fire to the wine;
while it is flaming, roll six ounces of butter in some
flour, and when it ceases to burn add it to your stew;
half an hour will be enough; when you may eat it, and
bless the memory of the good saint.
I have no doubt that it is an excellent dish, and
worthy the attention of sportsmen; but what will they
say to the following, which the good woman gave me,
as something equally economical and excellent, and
more attainable? I shall call it, what in fact it is, a
Recipe to dress Robin Redbreasts, Jenny Wrens, and sic
like.-When they are fat, snare them; empty, roll in
slices of bacon fat, and roast a little more perhaps than
ten minutes. When quite cold, you cut off and put aside
the wings and breasts; the remainder you chop up with
four shallots and two large glasses of any kind of white
wine, salt, pepper, a clove of garlic, and some olive-oil.
Simmer this mess twenty minutes, and strain it; then
put into the sauce the reserved pieces, and warm by
degrees till hot: serve with fried bread. It makes
almost as good a salmi as woodcocks, and as it may
be tried upon sparrows, without shocking our British
feelings, I give Mme Miau's recipe.
Skate, flounders, plaice, and similar fish, taste much
better au beurre noir; and as I know the worthy dame,
although she likes recherché dishes, contrives to make
them more economically than any one else, I have
learned from her how she proceeds.
'Add to the water into which you put them an onion,
a clove of garlic, a crushed clove, a bouquet garni, and
half a tumbler of vinegar; when it boils add the liver,
and let it make just nine more bubbles. Take off the
pan, skim it carefully, and place it by the side of the
fire. Then put some butter into a frying pan, and
when it boils crisp your parsley for garnishing. Take
that out, and add to the butter a glass of vinegar,
which must boil only one minute, when it is in a proper
state to pour upon the fish, which is sent up covered
with crisped parsley. Frogs,' pursued madame, 'al-
though a very expensive dish at Paris, are to be had
in some places very reasonable, and the common frog
makes as good broth as any; but dressed as mon
pauvre cher M. Miau loved, nothing can possibly be
better.'
'O pray tell me!'
'Well; cut fifty fat young frogs just a little below
the fore-legs, and skin the hinder ones; throw them
for five minutes into boiling water, with vinegar and
a little salt to blanch. In the meantime, put three
ounces of butter and a small spoonful of flour into a
stew-pan, and melt slowly, turning all the time, and
adding by degrees water, salt, pepper, and a bouquet
garni. Then pop in your frogs, and let them boil
twenty minutes. Take them out, and arrange them
tastefully on a dish; and lifting the stew-pan from
the fire (having first removed the bouquet), add the
beaten yolks of three eggs to the sauce, turning one
way until thick and smooth; pour it over your frogs,
and serve hot. They are likewise very good fried in
butter after blanching, and when cold, dipped in butter
and fried again a golden brown: you must always
for cold frogs are not good."
garnish with crisped parsley, and serve them very hot,
Artichokes Mme Miau was very fond of; and I have
frequently eaten them, as she generally prepared them
for herself. When nearly boiled enough, she removed
the choke and filled the hollow with parsley and chives
cut small, with salt, pepper, two mushrooms chopped,
and bread crumbs made into a paste with a little butter.
They were then placed on a tin with a little olive-oil
or oiled butter and gravy, and a few minutes in the
oven was sufficient to make them crisp and capital; but
you may also fill the hollow with anything you like
better-such as equal parts of underdone veal, oysters,
and bread crumbs, which are very nice. The bottoms
and tender portions of the leaves minced up and fried
in butter is one of many other modes of eating
artichokes; they are, however, all good. I beg to
bring into notice the following excellent sweet dish,
which is, however, an Italian, not a French recipe.
Saubaglione. For as many persons as you expect
put as many yolks of eggs, as many glasses of sweet
Malaga or Frontignan or any sweet wine-raisin-wine
will do very well-and half as many table-spoonfuls of
powdered loaf-sugar into a large bowl or chocolate-pot,
which you place upon a hot plate or gentle fire, and
turn with a whisk (moussoir) until it becomes the
consistence of whipt cream. Pour into glasses. This
is an exquisite dish.
The mustard, as sold in pots, is a very simple affair:
I constantly make my own as follows:-One ounce
mustard, two pinches of salt, and a large wine-glass of
boiling water are mixed and allowed to stand twenty-four
hours. Then pound in a mortar one clove of garlic, a
small handful of tarragon, another of garden-cress, and
add to the mustard, putting vinegar according to taste.
The great art is to make common things taste uncom-
monly well. Brussels sprouts, for instance, are sent up
to me merely boiled and drained: I put them in a pan
with a little bit of butter, pepper, and salt; shake them
about, and they are then a nice dish; and so on with
almost every vegetable-even new potatoes. Old ones,
when cold, are delicious, cut into very small pieces, and
put into a sauce composed of a little milk, flour, butter,
pepper, salt, and minced parsley, and shaken about till
the potatoes are hot: the sauce must boil first. And how
nice does the following roux make almost everything:
Butter and flour browned, and a minced onion, pepper
and salt, with a little water added, and all turned
round on the fire one way till the onions are melted
into nothing, and you taste only the flavour: you may
heat up thin slices of cold meat in this. And here I
may observe, that when a hash is tough from having
boiled too long, the only way to make it tender is to
let it stew gently for an hour more-a secret worth
knowing; but the best plan is only to warm it in
the gravy-merely warm it. Any one with a good
cookery-book and no stint may prepare a nice dish if
he is acquainted with the principles of cookery; but
what is wanted in this country is the art of making
common things good at little cost and with little
trouble and that we do not, and some will not
understand.

NATIONAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.
6
The Royal Preacher,' Dr James Hamilton, gives the
following account of our national advantages :- Behold
us here in Britain, in the heart of the nineteenth century,
surrounded with the broadest zone of peace and material
comfort to be found in all the map of history. Looking
at our temporal lot, we of this generation and this country
stand on the very pinnacle of outward advantage; in all
our lives never once affrighted by the rumour of invasion;
exempt from all the horrors of impressment and conscrip-
tion; ignorant of martyrdoms, religious and political-
free, self-governed, independent. Who knows it? Who
remembers it? Who in these matters adverts to his own
happiness? As she presses to her bosom her little boy,
or parts on his open brow the darkening hair, amidst all
her maternal pride, where is the mother who praises God
for her young Briton's privilege? How many hearts
remember to swell with the joyful recollection-Thank
God, he may leave me if he pleases; but he can never be
dragged from me against his will! He may become a
More among lawyers, a Latimer among preachers, a
Sidney among statesmen, and need dread neither stake
nor scaffold. He may become the victim of false accusa-
tion and malignant persecution; but he will not languish
without trial slow years in the dungeon, nor by the rack
be frenzied into a false witness against himself. He may
turn out unwise, he may turn out unhappy; but, thank
God, the son of a British sire can never feel the tyrant's
torture in his limbs, nor the brand of slavery on his
brow!'
Every word of it true; but the preacher, to be quite
fair, should have gone a step farther, and given the
smallest possible sketch of our disadvantages the few
ingredients employed to imbitter the sweet cup of life.
For example, at any moment we may be dragged into a
law or Chancery suit, by which, at a cost of thousands of
pounds, a delay of half a life-time, and troubles and
anxieties that are terrible to think of, we may at last
find ourselves ruined by the decision of a matter which
any two intelligent men could have settled in a single
hour! Surely the whole of law and Chancery proce-
dure is a thing eminently deserving consideration and
amendment.
MOONLIGHT IN THE TROPICS.
་
There is something exceedingly romantic in the nights
of the tropics. It is pleasant to sit on the landing-place
at the top of the flight of steps in front of Bluefields
House, after night has spread her purple wings' over
the sky, or even to lie at full length on the smooth
stones; it is a hard bed, but not a cold one, for the thick
flags, exposed to the burning sun during the day, become
thoroughly heated, and retain a considerable degree of
warmth till morning nearly comes again. The warmth
of the flat stones is particularly pleasant, as the cool night-
breezes play over the face. The scene is favourable for
meditation: the moon walking in brightness,' gradually
climbing up to the very centre of the deep-blue sky,
sheds on the grassy sward, the beasts, lying down here
and there, the fruit trees, the surrounding forest, and
the glistening sea spread out in front, a soft but brilliant
radiance unknown to the duller regions of the north.
The babbling of the little rivulet, winning its seaward
way over the rocks and pebbles, comes like distant
music upon the ear, of which the bass is supplied by the
roll of the surf falling on the sea-beach at measured
intervals a low hollow roar, protracted until it dies
away along the sinuous shore, the memorial of a fierce
but transitory sea-breeze. But there are sweeter sounds
than these. The mocking - bird takes his seat on the
highest twig of the orange- tree at my feet, and pours
forth his rich and solemn gushes of melody, with such
an earnestness as if his soul were in his song. A rival
from a neighbouring tree commences a similar strain,
and now the two birds exert all their powers, each
striving his utmost to outsing the other, until the silence
of the lonely night rings with bursts and swells, and
tender cadences of melodious song. Ilere and there, over
the pasture, the intermittent green spark of the fire-fly
flits along, and at the edges of the bounding woods
scores of twinkling lights are seen, appearing and dis-
appearing in the most puzzling manner. Three or four
bats are silently winging along through the air; now
passing over the face of the vertical moon like tiny black
specks, now darting through the narrow arch beneath the
steps, and now fitting so close over head that one is
tempted to essay their capture with an insect net. The
light of the moon, however, though clearly revealing their
course, is not powerful or precise enough for this, and the
little nimble leather wings pursue their giddy play in
security.-Gosse's Naturalist's Sojourn.
THE ROCK IN THE ATLANTIC.
BY THE REV. JAMES GILBORNE LYONS, LL.D.
In the sleepless Atlantic, remote and alone,
Is a rock which the wild waves all wrathfully beat;
Its echoing bulwarks with sea-drift are strewn,
And dark are the waters that roll at its feet.
Let the shrill winds of ocean go forth as they may,
It wars with the surges, and knows not of rest;
And billows are breaking in foam on its breast.
Its pinnacles drip with the fast-falling spray,
But though breakers and whirlwinds around it may sweep,
That hermit of ocean lives conquering on,
And the mariner sees it still fronting the deep,
As it flung back the surf in the years that are gone:
All worn but unshaken that desolate rock,
Fast rooted where islands and earthquakes are born,
Looks fearlessly down on the breaker's rude shock,
And laughs the vain force of the tempest to scorn.
O thou who reverest a Master above !
And sighest for glories immortal and high,
Be strong in believing, and steadfast in love,
When passion is loud and the tempter is nigh:
When infidels bid thee be false to thy Lord,
When they laugh at the Faith that ennobles and saves,
When they scoff at His people, and rail at His word,
Be thou to their wildness that rock in the waves.
Ay! stand like that sea-cliff, nor ask thou to shun
The work of obedience, the cares, or the cost:
There are treasures of infinite price to be won,
With the wiles of the tempter, his vengeance or mirth,
There are treasures of infinite price to be lost.
Strive thou as the bold and the faithful have striven,
Shall be paid in the peace and the raptures of heaven.
And the sorrows and toils of thy warfare on earth

WHAT BECOMES OF THE RIND?
Of all the occupations that exercise the ordinary
energies of human beings, the most abstracting is
that of sucking an orange. It seems to employ the
whole faculties for the time being. There is an
earnestness of purpose in the individual so employed
-an impassioned determination to accomplish what
he has undertaken that creates a kindred excite
ment in the bystanders. His air is thoughtful; his
eye severe, not to say relentless; and although his
mouth is full of inarticulate sounds, conversation is
out of the question. But the mind is busy although
the tongue is silent; and when the deed is accomplished,
the collapsed spheroid seems to swell anew with the
ideas to which the exercise had given birth. One of
these ideas we shall catch and fix, for occurring as it
did to ourselves, it is our own property: it was con-
tained in the question that rose suddenly in our mind
as we looked at the ruin we had made-What becomes
of the rind?
And this is no light question; no unimportant or
merely curious pastime for a vacant moment. In our
case it became more and more serious; it clung and
grappled, till it hung upon our meditations like the
albatross round the neck of the Ancient Mariner.
Only consider what a subject it embraces. The orange,
it is true, and its congener the lemon, are Celestial
fruits, owing their origin to the central flowery land;
but thanks to the Portuguese, they are now domesti-
cated in Europe, and placed within the reach of such
northern countries as ours, where the cold prohibits
their growth. Some of us no doubt force them in an
artificial climate at the expense of perhaps half a guinea
piece; but the bulk of the nation are content to
receive them from other regions at little more than the
cost of apples. Now the quantity we thus import
every year from the Azores, Spain, Portugal, Italy,
Malta, and other places, is about 300,000 chests, and
each of these chests contains about 650 oranges, all
wrapped separately in paper. But besides these we
are in the habit of purchasing a large quantity, en-
tered at the custom-house by number, and several
thousand pounds' worth, entered at value; so that the
whole number of oranges and lemons we consume
in this country may be reckoned modestly at some
220,000,000! Surely, then, it is not surprising that
while engaged in the meditative employment alluded
to we should demand with a feeling of strong interest
-What becomes of the rind?
Everybody knows that Scotch marmalade uses up
the rinds of a great many Seville oranges, as well as
an unknown quantity of turnip skins and stalks of the
PRICE 1d.
bore-cole, the latter known to the Caledonian manipula-
tors of the preserve as 'kail-custocks.' Everybody
understands also, that not a few of the rinds of edible
oranges take up a position on the pavement, where
their mission is to bring about the downfall of sundry
passers-by, thus accomplishing the fracture of a not in-
considerable number-taking one month with another
throughout the season-of arms, legs, and occiputs. It
is likewise sufficiently public that a variety of drinks
are assisted by the hot, pungent rinds of oranges and
lemons as well as by the juice; but notwithstanding
all these deductions, together with that of the great
quantity thrown away as absolute refuse, we shall find
a number of rinds unaccounted for large enough to
puzzle by its magnitude the Statistical Society. This
mystery, however, we have succeeded in penetrating,
and although hardly hoping to carry the faith of the
reader along with us, we proceed to unfold it: it is
contained in the single monosyllable, peel.
Orange-peel, lemon-peel, citron-peel-these are the
explanation: the last-mentioned fruit-imported from
Sicily, Madeira, and the Canary Islands-being hardly
distinguishable from a lemon except by its somewhat
less acid pulp and more pungent rind. Even a very
careless observer can hardly fail to be struck at this
season by the heaps of those candied rinds displayed
in the grocers' windows; but the wildest imagination
could not guess at anything so extravagant as the
quantity of the fruit thus used; and even when we
learn that upwards of 600 tons of peel are manufactured
in the year, it is a hopeless task to attempt to separate
that prodigious bulk into its constituent parts. Six
hundred tons of candied peel! of a condiment employed
chiefly, if not wholly, in small quantities in the com-
position of puddings and cakes. Six hundred tons-
12,000 hundredweights-1,344,000 pounds-21,504,000
ounces! But having once got possession of the fact,
see how suggestive it is. Let us lump the puddings
and cakes in one; let us call them all puddings-plum-
puddings of four pounds' weight. We find, on consult-
ing the best authorities-for we would not presume to
dogmatise on such a subject-that the quantity of peel
used in the composition of such a work is two ounces;
and thus we are led to the conclusion that we Britishers
devour in the course of a year 10,752,000 full-sized, re-
spectable plum-puddings, irrespective of all such articles
as are not adorned and enriched with candied peel.
Citrons intended for peel are imported in brine, but
oranges and lemons in boxes. All are ripe in Decem-
ber, January, and February; but as it would be incon-
venient to preserve so vast a quantity at the same time,
the juice is squeezed out, and the collapsed fruit packed
in pipes, with salt and water, till wanted. When the

time for preserving comes, it is taken from the pipes,
and boiled till soft enough to admit of the pulp being
scooped out; then the rind is laid in tubs or cisterns,
and melted sugar poured over it. Here it lies for three
or four weeks; and then the sugar is drained away, and
the rind placed on trays in a room constructed for the
purpose. It now assumes the name of 'dried peel,'
and is stored away in the original orange and lemon
boxes, till wanted for candying.
The other constituents of a plum-pudding add but
little testimony on the subject of number. We cannot
even guess the proportion of the 170,000 lbs. of nutmegs
we receive from the Moluccas, and our own possessions
in the Malay Straits, which may be thus employed; nor
how much cinnamon Ceylon sends us for the purpose
in her annual remittance of about 16,000 lbs. ;* nor
what quantity of almonds is abstracted, with a similar
view, from the 9000 cwts. we retain for our own
consumption from the importations from Spain and
Northern Africa. Currants are more to our purpose-
for that small Corinth grape, the produce of the
islands of Zante, Kephalonia, and Ithaca, and of the
Morea, which comes to us so thickly coated with dust
that we might seem to import vineyard and all-
belongs, like the candied peel, almost exclusively to
cakes and puddings. Of this fruit we devour in the
year about 180,000 cwts. Raisins, being in more gene-
ral use at the dessert, for instance, and in making
sweet wine-are in still greater demand: we cannot do
with less than 240,000 cwts. of them. They are named
from the place where they grow-such as Smyrna or
Valencia; or from the grape-such as muscatel, bloom,
or sultana; but the quality depends, we believe, chiefly
on the mode of cure. The best are called raisins of
the sun, and are preserved by cutting half through the
stalks of the branches when nearly ripe, and leaving
them to dry and candy in the genial rays. The next
quality is gathered when completely ripe, dipped in a
lye of the ashes of the burned tendrils, and spread out
to bake in the sun. The inferior is dried in an oven.
The black Smyrna grape is the cheapest; and the
muscatels of Malaga are the dearest.
With flour, sugar, brandy, &c. we do not propose to
interfere; for although the quantities of these articles
thus consumed are immense, they bear but a small
proportion to the whole importations. Eggs, however,
are in a different category. Eggs are essential to the
whole pudding race; and without having our minds
opened, as they now are, to the full greatness of the
plum-pudding, it would be difficult for us to discover
the rationale of the vast trade we carry on in eggs.
In our youthful days, when as yet plum-puddingism
was with us in its early, empirical state, we used to
consider egg-merchant' a term of ridicule, resembling
the term 'timber-merchant' as applied to a vender of
matches. But we now look with respect upon an
egg-merchant, as an individual who manages an impor-
tant part of the trade of this country with France and
Belgium; not to mention its internal traffic in the same
commodity. It strikes us, however, that on this sub-
ject the Frenchman and Belgian are wiser in their
generation than ourselves. We could produce our own
eggs easily enough if we would take the trouble; but
rather than do this we hire them to do it for us, at an
6
expense of several scores of thousands sterling in the
year. They of course are very much obliged to us,
though a little amused no doubt at the eccentricity of
John Bull; and with the utmost alacrity supply us
annually with about 90,000,000 eggs. John eats his
foreign pudding, however he is partial to foreign
things-with great gravity, and only unbends into a
smile when he sees his few chickens hopping about the

farmyard, the amusement of his children, or the little
perquisite, perhaps, of his wife. He occasionally eats
a newly-laid egg, the date of its birth being care-
fully registered upon the shell; thinks it a very clever
thing in him to provide his own luxuries; and is
decidedly of opinion that an English egg is worth two
of the mounseers'. His neglect of this branch of rural
economy, however, does not prevent his wondering
sometimes how these fellows contrive to make the
two ends of the year meet, when he himself finds it
so difficult a matter to get plums to his pudding.
What becomes of the rind? We have shewn what be-
comes of the rind. We have shewn what apparently in-
considerable matters swell up the commerce of a great
country. A plum-pudding is no joke. It assembles
within itself the contributions of the whole world, and
gives a fillip to industry among the most distant tribes
and nations. But it is important likewise in other re-
spects. Morally and socially considered, its influence is
immense. At this season of the year, more especially,
it is a bond of family union, and a symbol of friendly
hospitality. We would not give a straw for that man,
woman, or child, in the frank, cordial circles of Old
English life, who does not hail its appearance on the table
with a smile and a word of welcome. Look at its round,
brown, honest, unctuous face, dotted with almonds and
fragrant peel, surmounted with a sprig of holly, and
radiant amid the flames of burning brandy! Who is
for plum-pudding? We are, to be sure. What a rich
perfume as it breaks on the plate! And this fragrant
peel, so distinguishable amid the exhalations!-ha!
Delaeioucious!-that's what becomes of the rind!
A WORD ON CANADA.
LITTLE has been of late heard of Canada, either as a
field of emigration or otherwise. It has, however, been
going on in a satisfactory course of improvement: its
population and resources are rapidly increasing, and in
certain social arrangements, more particularly that
relating to education, it may be said to be taking the
lead of the mother-country. Some one recently made
the observation, that as regards improvements of
one kind or other, he believed more was now done in
Canada than in any equal portion of the United States;
but that while the States let everybody hear what they
were about, Canada held its tongue. This was perhaps
a view of affairs more jocular than real; but it is gra-
tifying to have good authority for the fact, that Canada,
taken all in all, is becoming a well-settled, intelligent,
and highly prosperous country.
This state of things appears to have been gradually
brought about within the last few years, and just in
proportion as the colonists have been freed from the
impracticable rule of the colonial office, and left to
manage their own affairs: not that there is not some-
thing to complain of yet when did Englishmen not
grumble?-but in comparison with past times the
present is assuredly a golden age of municipal freedom.
The rapid rise of Canada, and its present and pro-
spective condition, form the subject of much interesting
detail in a work of little pretension, but of genuine
merit, by Mr James B. Brown, a person who resided in
the colony for several years, and who, from his mercan-
tile pursuits, enjoyed a tolerably good opportunity of
acquiring useful information.*

from it such an array of facts as will illustrate the
general progress of Canadian affairs, and so give
intending emigrants something to which they may look
forward with a degree of confidence.

to 50,000; in 1842, it had reached 486,000; and in 1848,
it had mounted up to 723,000-an increase in six years
of 237,000. The whole colony, upper and lower, has
now a population exceeding the half of that of Scotland,
while its cultivated land already exceeds that of all
Scotland. The ratio of increase of cultivation to increase
in the number of people is startling. In England,
during the first quarter of the present century, 37 acres
were brought into cultivation for every 100 of increase
of the population; but in Canada the increase of every
100 inhabitants adds 265 acres to the amount of culti-
vated land. The multiplication of cattle, horses, and
other stock, is on a similarly large ratio. A very agree-
able view of the increasing comforts of life is afforded in
the fact, that the colony lately owned 4680 carriages for
pleasure, whereas the number of these carriages in 1842
was only 980. All who saw the late Exhibition in Lon-
don can bear witness to the elegance of workmanship
in Canadian sleighs, and various articles of domestic
use. The recent increase in the number of carriages,
we are told by Mr Brown, is very much caused by an
improvement in the roads. The great thoroughfares
are now laid with planks, and these plank-roads have
proved of great advantage to the country. It is to be
regretted, however, that tolls have been introduced for
the support of these improved thoroughfares. Toll-bars
are the simple and rude expedient of a semi-barbarous
people, and are in any view a costly apparatus to the
public, for one-half the money levied goes to the keepers
of the bars. We should be glad to see our Canadian
brethren give us a lesson in dismissing toll-bars, and
setting an example of a rational method of maintaining
the public roads out of public resources.
Canada is one of the best customers of England; but
it is under strong temptations to deal with the United
States in preference- that is, to smuggle instead of
paying custom-house duties. For example, the duty
on tea imported into Canada is 24d. currency per lb.;
but tea imported into the United States is free; conse-
quently, in every pound-weight coming contraband
across the frontier there is so much saved. Thus
the statistics of the regular trade cannot present
an accurate view of the entire commerce. Latterly,
the export-trade from Canada to the States has been
rising into importance. Of all things entering into a
trade of this kind, the last we should have expected is
timber; for of this article it is commonly believed that
the States are afflicted with a redundance. But strange
to say, timber is getting scarce in the more settled parts
of the Union, and we shall not be surprised to hear
of encouragement being given to the planting of trees!
Meanwhile, the Canadians are driving a great trade in
supplying the produce of the forest to the States, and
this in its turn gives corresponding employment to lum-
berers and saw-mills. If this trade materially increase
in England, it may soon affect the prices of Canadian
timber. At all events, as matters stand, it is consola-
tory to think that the Canadian timber-trade is not
quite ruined by the reduction of duties on Baltic timber
in Great Britain. How true the old saying: As one
door shuts another opens!'
Canada is rich in mineral resources, and these have
lately come into operation. We do not hear of gold
being found for the gathering; but the author before
us speaks of extensive copper-mining along the shores
of Lake Huron and Lake Superior, and informs us that
the joint-stock associations engaged in this species of
enterprise are successful. In 1848, 1000 tons of
copper were procured from one mine alone.' After
referring to the fisheries, Mr Brown goes on to explain
that Canada has not been dead to railway enterprise.
There are at present four lines of railway in the
country worked by steam-power. The earliest intro-
duced into Canada was the Champlain and St Lawrence
Railway-connecting the navigation of Lake Cham-
plain, at the town of St Johns, with the south bank of
the St Lawrence, at the village of Laprairie, nearly
opposite Montreal. The distance is fourteen miles;
and the same company possess the privileges of the
ferry across the river to Montreal-a distance of nine
miles-on which they employ two steam-boats. The
stock of this company is understood to be one of the
best, if not the best, in the colony. The Montreal and
Lachine Railway, which was finished about three years
ago, is over a distance of nine miles, between the
city of Montreal and the village of Lachine, situated
towards the upper end of the island of Montreal.
The third of the railways in operation in Canada
is the St Lawrence and Atlantic Railway, connecting
the St Lawrence, a little below Montreal on the
opposite shore, with the Atlantic Ocean at the town
of Portland, state of Maine. The distance is about
280 miles, of which 130 miles are on the Canada side
and 150 on the American. A considerable portion on
the Canada side is understood to be now in operation.
A continuation of this line from Portland to Halifax
is contemplated. In connection with the Atlantic
steam-ships landing at Halifax, speedier communi-
cation with Europe will thus be effected, both for
Canada, and much of the other British-American
provinces, and for the United States.' Other railways
are contemplated, chiefly in the western part of the
province; and there is a universal inclination among
proprietors of land to promote this improved kind of
communication. It is only in our own country that
there has been manifested a disposition to obstruct
railway undertakings, and rob the projectors of these
great national works.
We pass on to Mr Brown's exposition of the state of
crime. The statistics presented on this subject seem
to shew that Canada possesses a population much less
prone to crime than we can boast of in either England
or Scotland. As usual, the bulk of the crime com-
mitted may be traced to the agency of intoxicating
drinks; yet, cheap as these liquors are in Canada, it is
satisfactory to learn that the use of them is greatly on
the decrease.' A curious fact this, and well deserving
the notice of those who imagine that indulgence in
drink is in proportion to its accessibility. We are
informed that imprisonment for one or more years in a
penitentiary is the Canadian method of repressing
crime; and it is stated that the district of Huron, with
a population of upwards of 20,000, had in a series of
six years sent only one inmate to this place of con-
finement! With all our parade of civilisation, no
district of Great Britain could match this fact.
The remarkable paucity of crime which the above
and some other statistics would seem to indicate, is
doubtless owing in a great degree to the wide scope for
personal enterprise in a right direction. In our own
old country, much of the misconduct of the criminal
class arises from the restrictions under which they
labour. Men who would make good backwoodsmen
take to poaching and other furtive outlets of an ad-
venturous spirit. The half-idle, dawdling, hopeless
existence that many men are doomed to with us must
likewise dispose to crime. Canada, with its boundless
resources, its scope for all sorts of intractable natures,
its room for individual effort untrammelled by refined
conventionalities, presents, therefore, opportunities of
well-doing of which there is little experience in Eng-
land. But here comes another important ally of
social order. In this comparatively young colony a
liberal provision has been made for education. In 1841,
the provincial legislature set aside L.50,000 currency
per annum as a common school fund-a sum consider-
ably greater than is expended on the parish schools of
Scotland; and so late as January 1850, 'one million of
acres of land have also been set aside for the support
of public education.' Elementary schools are every-
where established, and supported partly by these grants
and partly by local rates. Their management is in the

hands of district municipalities, and a general inspector,
answerable to the governor, aids materially in their
establishment and in preserving uniformity of pro-
cedure. The number of schools in Upper Canada in
1849 was 2871, and the total amount of annual salaries
of teachers was L.107,713 currency. Canada, as is
well known, possesses a population belonging to various
religious denominations; and one is naturally curious
to know how they come to an agreement on the sub-
ject of school instruction. We shall leave Mr Brown
to explain how this delicate matter is managed.
Those warring grounds, which mostly in every
country are found to throw impediments in the way of
almost every conceivable system of popular instruction
-the religious scruples of the various sects-are thus
disposed of here:-Whenever the inhabitants of any
township or parish, professing a religious faith different
from that of the majority of the inhabitants, shall dis-
sent from the arrangement of the commissioners, with
reference to any school, the dissentients signifying such
to the district council, with names of persons elected
by them as trustees, such trustees, conforming to the
duties of commissioners, are allowed to establish and
maintain schools, and to receive a share of the general
funds. The value of a provision of this kind is no
less liberal than important in a country inhabited, as
Canada is, by people from many various countries, and
professing every variety of creed; indeed, it is not
possible to expect a system of public instruction to be
successfully carried on without liberal concessions to
opinions and creeds, provided always that the leading
objects and design of education recognised by all be
steadily kept in view. Besides the commissioners and
trustees for the country, there are, for incorporated
towns and cities, from six to fourteen persons appointed
by the governor as Boards of Examiners, who shall
exercise a check upon the powers of the local incorpo-
rations in the election of teachers. These boards consist
of an equal number of Catholics and Protestants; and
dividing themselves into two departments, one over
the schools attended by Catholic children, the other
over the Protestant schools, they exercise the privileges
of regulating the schools and courses of study in the
same manner as the commissioners and trustees do in
the country schools.'
The means thus described, by which the interests
of different religious denominations are preserved, do
not appear to differ materially from those adopted by
the Committee of Privy-Council on Education, which,
in point of fact, will extend pecuniary aid to the
schools of any religious body; and as this is exclaimed
against as an invasion of principle by a very numerous
and powerful party, we are unpleasantly reminded that
the munificent policy which educates the entire juve-
nile population of Upper Canada, could not be applied
on a scale of national importance to Great Britain.
How distressing to think that the warring pretensions,
jealousies, and fears-possibly misunderstandings-of
large sections of well-meaning and piously-disposed
people, should in effect, as regards elementary instruc-
tion, keep this great country behind her own colonies!
With respect to the prospects of agricultural settlers
in Upper Canada, the work before us abounds in the
most interesting details. Notwithstanding that the
winters are severe (though not unpleasant), and that
snow suspends field operations for several months,
farmers with a fair share of industry and but a mode-
rate capital are almost sure to do well, and to possess,
after a few years, a considerable amount of property.
Among instances of enterprise being thus rewarded,
Mr Brown refers to the case of Mr Ferguson of Wood-
hill, a gentleman who emigrated from Scotland to
Upper Canada in 1833; giving up all the elegances of
life in an old country for the chances of the bush.
In a pleasant and fertile part of Upper Canada, on the
banks of the Grand River, Mr Ferguson purchased
about 8000 acres of land. His village of Fergus, on
the pleasant slope of a branch of that fine stream, is
now,' says Mr Brown, one of the most smiling and
prosperous spots of Canada. He has made an inde-
pendent and comfortable provision for his family; and
the extent of his personal influence, and his example,
as one of the most enterprising farmers of the colony,
unite to make his position, in the eyes of honourable
ambition, one highly desirable. How soon might the
whole of Canada be changed into one smiling farm,
were Mr Ferguson's enterprising example extensively
followed by others in his station of society, who are
now spending comparatively unprofitable years in the
overcrowded avenues of ambition in the parent country!
Canada, however, is fast becoming the prosperous and
smiling farm anticipated, chiefly without such honour-
able assistance. The day-labourers, mechanics, and
small farmers of England, Scotland, and Ireland, have
already accomplished much in performance of such a
task in this magnificent colony, and are rewarded by
becoming the independent and comfortable proprietors
of the lands whose forests their enterprise and industry
have so conspicuously and profitably subdued.'
The rapid manner in which populous townships
spring into existence is a curious feature of the Cana-
dian wilderness. We are accustomed, in the old
country, to see provincial towns in a state of languid
existence-just living, and that is all-population
almost at a stand; a few tradesmen and shopkeepers
struggling to make both ends meet, and so depend-
ent on the neighbouring squirearchy that they dare
not utter an independent sentiment; with a horde
of unhappy beings still more depressed, decayed la-
bourers, paupers, and nondescripts, whose means of
livelihood are a mystery. In such places there is little
visible change on the face of property.
The same
amount of land in tillage; the same number of houses;
the same institutions; and from generation to gene-
ration the same body of traditional recollections.
The most dismal thing in places of this kind, is the
hopelessness of situation. There is no scope for enter-
prise; the cleverest person is bound down to a mono-
tonous routine of petty duties, without any prospect of
improving his circumstances. A family is seen to be
growing up, but what to do with them is a puzzle.
There are no openings for the sons; the daughters are
not likely to be married. With what avidity are small
appointments sought for-cringed for! How melan-
choly to see able and intelligent individuals-men up
to anything-doomed to throw themselves away in
these forlorn, antiquated places, when they might be
up and doing, with a wide world before them where
to choose! Turning our eyes from this picture of
physical and moral decay, how different does every-
thing appear in the United States of America and in
Upper Canada, where towns start into life, and become
the seats of a busy population within a few years!
Forests levelled; lands brought under tillage; new roads
opened; fresh institutions got up; on all sides the tokens
of a vigorous social economy; and so wide a scope for
investment and enterprise, that the difficulty consists
in the very choice. Mr Brown presents some striking
examples of this progression; and we select that of
London, a township situated in the fertile peninsula
between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. This township
was all a forest, without an inhabitant, until 1817,
when two families settled in it. The population may
now be stated to be about 10,000, possessed of above
100,000 acres of land, of which 20,000 are cultivated.
The first regular settlement commenced in 1818 under
Mr Talbot, a gentleman from Ireland, accompanied by
several of his countrymen, for whom he obtained from
government free grants of land and a free passage to
Montreal. A son of the founder, writing in 1834, gave
this account of the colonists who emigrated to the town-
ship of London with his father: "Scarcely an individual

A gentleman, at a public meeting in this part of
Canada in 1843, took occasion to express sentiments
suggested by the prosperous appearance of the settle-
ment; and with these we shall conclude. The time
is not far distant,' said this acute observer, when
this country will be better known than it now is-
the time is at hand when our people at home will not
consider that coming to Canada is coming to the back-
woods of a wilderness. They will find, as I have found
to my great astonishment, good roads, good modes of
conveyance, and as good towns as in Europe, with shops
well stored, not only with the necessaries but the luxu-
ries of life. They will learn that this town, which now
consists of handsome buildings-the one in which we
are now assembled, the Mechanics' Institute, giving a
stamp of respectability, intelligence, and a taste for the
fine arts, of which you may be justly proud-contained
but four cottages fourteen years ago. These facts will
speak trumpet-tongued, and render this noble country,
under British dominion and your unanimity, the noblest
appendage to Her Majesty's dominions. It is the
natural and the fittest outlet for the superabundant
capital, people, and enterprise of the mother-country,
presenting as it does an opening for the investment not
only of thousands, but of millions of capital, abounding
in all the elements of wealth-navigable rivers, a luxu-
riant soil, and a congenial climate, and undoubted
security on real estate at high rates of interest, and
to an unlimited extent.'
Is not all this very much like saying to the half-idle
sojourners in our old provincial towns: Get thee gone
out of the country; cast thyself loose from localities
where no good is to be done, and betake thee to lands
in which a kind Providence offers to thee a rich
inheritance!
THE UGLY GOVERNESS.
'I HAVE a new institutrice, who comes for three hours
every day; and do you know, ma petite tan-tante, mamma
says she is so ugly!'
And do you not think her so, Lolotte?'
'Point a moral and adorn a tale;'
for even most of the names once so celebrated have
disappeared entirely, or are at least only surviving in
poverty and obscurity, far from the scene of their
former triumph. We retraced its history from the
commencement on to that sad night when poor Marie
Antoinette was driven from her warm bed never more
to return, and on through the Reign of Terror till the
present time: our steps echoed in the now still courts
where once there had been such perpetual clatter and
bustle; all the bustlers, and petitioners, and intriguers
in the grave, and as much forgotten as the petty in-
trigues that had occupied their frivolous minds. Ver-
sailles was now the property of the nation, of the people
it had trampled on and despised. Much did we moralise,
and very melancholy did our moralising make us,
until some one remarking that if we did not make
haste we should not get good places to see the waters
play, we quickened our pace, recovered our spirits,
and in a few minutes added another group to the
many assembled in expectation of what is certainly
well worth beholding once.
We waited a considerable time; and to make it pass
more pleasantly, I entertained myself by scrutinising
the various little parties immediately in our vicinity,
busying myself with conjecturing who they were,
whence they came, and in short composing little
domestic histories for each and all in my imagination.
Nearly opposite to us were seated as it appeared three
old ladies, an old gentleman, a young man, and a
girl. Two of the ladies bore the impress of former
beauty, the other was plain; but the young girl was
lively and lovely; and I soon could perceive that the
youth was evidently more ardent in his attentions
and admiration than the most affectionate brother. I
therefore sagaciously set him down for a lover of the
little lady's, and such, in fact, he proved to be. The
third elderly female, I also perceived, upon a more
attentive inspection, was, after all, not old, only most
particularly plain-large, lumpy features, unshaded by
her hair, which was braided or brushed so far back that
at first sight she did not appear to have any; and very
small, black, bead-like eyes did not certainly set off to
much advantage a great expanse of muddy white face,
which was neither hidden nor helped by the small

was there-the middle and lower, however, predomi-

and seemed resolved to keep up good - humour and

us to call any one ugly-only when she saw Mile Hélie

than beauty, because mamma says goodness will take
us to Heaven and beauty wont, though we shall find it
there; and all, even Mile Hélie, become as beautiful
as angels.'

forgotten herself so far as to call the poor institutrice
ugly she was, I thought, perfectly frightful. A
respectable - looking woman whom I had observed
conversing with Mme Hélie seated herself beside me
shortly after, and I, as is usual in France, soon scraped
acquaintance with her, and led the way I wished her
to follow-namely, to the Hélies and their history.
"They were once,' said she, 'very well off, but are
now so nearly destitute, that, were it not for Henriette,
who goes out teaching, I don't know how they could
manage to live. Ah, what a pity she is so plain! for
her heart is as good as an angel's, and she is as clever
as a membre de l'Académie. She rises early, gives
her parents their breakfast, and cleans out their room:
she then sets out upon her pilgrimage, and never
returns until late at night, when she dines or sups;
after which she has much to do to prepare for the next
day's lessons, and to put her poor wardrobe in order.
She will wear herself to death, but that she says she
does not mind, so that she only lives long enough to lay
her parents in the grave. There,' pointing to Clélie
and her mother, are her aunt and cousin, the Clair-
villes. They have a much better income, and might
indeed be very comfortable did Clélie spend less on
her dress; but her mother spoils her so: enfin, it don't
much signify. M. Mervale is rich, and has proposed;
and if they can only push on the marriage before the
love-fit is burnt out and he begins to see clearly, she
will be a much more fortunate girl than she deserves
to be.'
Clélie was, I must admit, very pretty, although
beyond eyes, teeth, and hair, none of her features were
quite faultless-her little nose was not very classi-
cally formed, and her mouth was positively wide; but
pretty every one felt her to be, and M. Mervale above
all seemed under the influence of an enchantment: he
looked at no other person, listened to no other voice;
while she, completely secure, as she thought, of her
conquest, gave herself very little trouble to attend to
him, and kept staring in a coquettish manner about
her, as if she wished to attract the notice of others.
Poor M. de Mervale sighed, and gazed, and turned
away one minute, as if lost in thought, and then roused
himself up again to watch the motions of the frivolous,
but too fascinating little flutterer. Presently a group
of gay young men came and stood near us, all in high
spirits, laughing, jesting, whispering, and quizzing.
Mile Clélie was evidently the subject of their remarks,
but I could only hear a word here and there. C'est
l'épouseur?' 'Il en a bien l'air.' 'Pauvre diable !'
'Mais.' Then the grim cousin was likened to a box of
carpenter's tools all angles. But,' said one,
were my
evil genius to force me to make either my wife, I would
rather risk my future with la laide.'
In the evening we encountered the group again,
Clélie dancing with one of the party of young men I
had remarked in the morning, whom all his companions
now seemed agreed in calling 'Marquis, although
before I often heard them address him, and invariably
name him Hyppolite. One of the old ladies looked on
approvingly, but the Hélies seemed vexed, and poor
M. Mervale in a pitiable state. Mlle Hélie was, as it
appeared, exerting herself to comfort him, and take off
his attention, but he paid little heed to her observations.
'Silly, silly girl! you are throwing away your happi-
ness and your future prospects; and it is plain these
young men are either encouraging your folly, to open
M. Mervale's eyes, or to amuse themselves for the
passing hour, careless of the misery they may occa-
sion' - were my reflections as I looked at Clélie,
who was rolling about her pretty eyes à la Française,
thinking herself the admired of all observers, as well as
of M. Mervale. But the evening drew in, and I was
prevented from moralising any more, as we returned
home, leaving Mlle Clairville in the midst of a polka with
Hippolyte, displaying ten thousand airs and graces,
-
and plainly shewing to all lookers-on her admiration of
him whom she evidently never doubted was her noble
partner and admiring lover. But although this attracted
my attention at the time, I very soon forgot all about
it, even though I pursued my acquaintance with Mme
Mauviette, the lady who had related to me the history
of the Hélies and Clairvilles, inasmuch as madame her-
self was a character worth studying. This good dame,
with a husband, two children, and a very moderate
income, chose to be considered at one and the same
time an economist and a woman of fashion and refine-
ment; and if you took her from her own representation,
she was either of these characters according to the way
in which she chose you to consider her. She loved show,
could not live without excitement or amusement, but
knew that if some of her husband's relations thought
her extravagant, she would lose their help towards
enabling her to make the figure she wished to assume
in the eyes of others; and the clash of the two necessities
was most amusing, and must have cost her a world of
trouble. She boasted that she kept but one servant,
and denounced the extravagance of her sister-in-law,
who, with the same family and no more fortune, had
two; forgetting all the while that these two did all
that was required, needlework included, while Mme
Mauviette's dashing Lucile-what with her high wages,
washing, wine, coffee and sugar à discretion, presents
and perquisites-took from her as much as the other
lady divided between her cook and unpretending house-
maid. Mme Mauviette also said nothing of the femme de
journée she had for three or four days every week; nor
of the sewing-girl she employed for five of six every
month; nor of the man who came every Wednesday to
wax and brush her floors. She received every Thurs-
day en cérémonie: had friends in the morning, friends at
dinner, friends in the evening; and the remaining six
days were occupied in returning the visits she that
Thursday received. And yet she said she lived quite
out of the world, in privation and solitude, saw none
but intimate friends, and went to no parties-that is,
none where diamonds and continual new dresses were
indispensable, for these were beyond her powers; and
to hear her complain you would imagine that they
alone were what was worth living for. With such a
person the Hélies and Clairvilles when out of sight
were out of mind: they could be of no use, except when
they furnished conversation by accident, as they had
happened to do at Versailles. A year nearly therefore
elapsed without my ever once thinking of Clélie and
her coquetries, when my niece Lolotte ran in one morn-
ing breathless, her rosy face radiant with satisfaction.
'Do you know, ma tante, that Mlle Hélie is going to be
married? She herself told mamma, who at first thought
she must be raving, but 'tis quite true: upon the 16th
she will be Madame Mervale! Everybody is so sur-
prised, and all as glad; for you know she is so good and
so poor, and le futur so rich and good-natured. I alone
am sorry, for I must have a new governess, and she
may perhaps be cross-at anyrate I am sure I can
never love her so well as Mlle Hélie.'
The news was quite true. Clélie, thinking she had
made a noble conquest, behaved so very foolishly, that
M. Mervale's eyes at last opened, and, as a necessary
consequence, his heart shut. He now saw her the frivo-
lous being she in fact always was; and taking advantage
of her willingness to give up an engagement he at last
perceived could bring him nothing but misery, the
affair was broken off to the infinite relief of both; for
Clélie thought she was secure of the marquis '—so
little did she or her weak mother know of the world.
This was not all: the virtues, sweet temper, high prin-
ciple, and good sense of her cousin had long been known
to M. Mervale; and now he had in some degree become
accustomed to her extreme plainness, he asked himself
why, as he had made up his mind to marry, he should
not marry her? Her surprise was great when he pro-

posed, and his still greater when she refused him.
She could not and would not leave her poor old
parents,' she said: so after thinking the matter over,
her present conduct only raised her higher in his
esteem, and he consented, nay, insisted upon the old
couple occupying rooms in his house. The whole town
talked of course, and every one rejoiced except Clélie;
for her new lover-who turned out to be a silk-mercer,
not a marquis-after dancing attendance for a few
weeks, danced off and married another lady.
About a year after these events, I was one hot day
sitting under the trees near Ranelagh, and eating an
ice, while watching the gay Parisians going to the
Thursday's ball there, when my niece whispered: 'Do
you see that bonne in a Norman cap sitting on the
grass there with a baby?'
'Yes.'
'Well, that is Madame Mervale's baby, and I am
looking to see her come for it; she went to take a
drive farther in the bois,'
The baby in question was a fine healthy boy; and
while we were playing with and caressing it, the
carriage stopped, and a lady alighted. At first sight
I could scarcely believe it was the ci-devant Mlle
Henriette Hélie, so much was she altered for the better.
Her skin, although pale, was now clear; her teeth-
thanks to Georges Fattet, that capital dentist-good,
white, and even; her huge bones were covered; curls
softened her large features; and the smile of affection
and newly-awakened domestic feelings lightened and
gave expression to her former impassive countenance.
She was richly, tastefully, and fashionably dressed, by
the joint exertions of a first-rate modiste and her femme-
de-chambre; and the knowledge that she now filled a
certain position gave her motions and manners more
ease, and consequently more grace. I am told she and
her husband are perfectly happy, and that la cousine
Clélie is still unmarried and still unwise.
CHRISTMAS IN THE OLDEN TIME.
'The time draws near the birth of Christ;
The moon is hid, the night is still;
The Christmas bells from hill to hill
Answer each other in the mist.'
'WHO made Christmas?' was a question that arose
last year in a Christmas party. The querist, with
legitimate curiosity, looked round for a reply; but for
a time no one spoke. At length some said one thing,
some another, yet far short of what was required
to constitute a satisfactory reply: every one was
surprised to find how little was really known on a
subject which promised to be interesting; and ulti-
mately it was arranged that one of the party should
prepare what learned folk call a 'paper' which should
answer the question, and be read at their next meeting
-in the present year 1851.
Following this paper, we proceed to state that
festivities at the close of the year are of much older
date than Christianity. The use of evergreens, and the
veneration for the misletoe, are traceable in the history
of ancient nations, both of the south and north of
Europe; and the Roman Saturnalia are known to
every classical student. 'It was,' we are told, 'towards
the close of December that all the town was in an
unusual motion, and the children everywhere invoking
Saturn; nothing now to be seen but tables spread
out for feasting, and nothing heard but shouts of
merriment; all business was dismissed, and none at
work but cooks and confectioners; no account of
expenses was to be kept, and it appears that one-tenth
part of a man's income was to be appropriated to this
jollity. All exertion of body and mind was forbidden,
except for the purpose of recreation; nothing to be
read or recited which did not provoke mirth, adapted
to the season and the place. The slaves were allowed
the utmost freedom of raillery and truth with their
masters; sitting with them at table, dressed in their
clothes, playing all sorts of tricks, and telling them of
their faults to their faces, while they smutted them.
No one was allowed to be angry, and he who was
played on, if he loved his own comfort, would be the
first to laugh.' This licentious folly-libertas Decembri
lasted for a week, during which the holly branches
were sent round on their friendly errand.
The early Christians seem to have very soon begun
to celebrate the day of the Nativity at the time of
the Saturnalia; probably finding it the most convenient
season for the purpose, and perhaps seeking to turn
an old-established custom to a superior use. It appears
that in the first century Clement said: 'Brethren, keep
diligently feast-days, and truly in the first place the
day of Christ's birth;' and in the following century it
was further ordained, that in the holy night of the
Nativity of our Lord and Saviour, they do celebrate
public church-services, and in them solemnly sing
the Angel's Hymn, because also the same night He
was declared unto the shepherds by an angel, as the
truth itself doth witness.' Worshippers were enjoined
to eschew rigidly the spirit of paganism; but in spite
of the endeavours to impart a serious tone to the
festival, it continued to be chiefly a scene of noisy
revelry.
After the Saxons and Danes came the Normans,
bringing with them additions and variations of the
Christmas observances, in the rudiments of mysteries
and miracle-plays, and of mummeries, maskings, and
pageants. These last were first exhibited in the reign
of Henry II., and kept up by his Lion-hearted successor,
as appears in the old romance:
'Christmas is a time full honest;
Kyng Richard it honoured with gret feste,
All his clerks and barouns
Were set in their pavylouns,
And served with gret plenté
Of mete and drink, and each dainté.'
From the custom of singing masses on the eve of the
Nativity we derive the name of Christsmass, or Christ-
mas, for the sacred festival; and from the permission
accorded to servants and poor people to go round with
their boxes and collect money to pay for the masses
recited by the priests for their deceased or distant
friends we get our term-and its attendant practice-
disuse is greatly to be desired. But to return to the
Christmas-box, one so much abused that its entire
miracle-plays they speedily grew into favour, and
were made use of by the clergy as a means of diverting
the minds of the people from some of the gross habits
endeared to them by long custom. But if any good
impressions were made, they were soon effaced by the
licence of the Christmas mummeries, at which so much
power was given to the Lord of Misrule. The English
in general were so strongly attached to their customary
pastimes, that when at the siege of Orleans, the lords
requested of the French commanders that they might
have a night of minstrelsy, with trumpets and clarions;'
which request, the chronicler tells us, was granted,
and the horrors of war were suspended by melodies
that were felt to be delightful.' It was a strange cele-
bration of peace amid the terrors of war.

Christmas proceedings gradually became so riotous,
that Henry VIII. passed several statutes, charging all
serving-men and journeymen artificers not to play
their games except in the Christmas holidays, and then
only on their masters' premises. At times, during
this reign, there was competition between the king
and his minister Wolsey, as to who should celebrate
Christmas in the most stately manner. On one occa-
sion when, on account of a great mortality in London,
the monarch kept himself quiet at Eltham, the car-

dinal laye at the manor of Richemond, and there kept
open householde, to lordes, ladies, and all other that
would come, with plaies and disguisyng in most royall
maner.' The king, however, made up for his abstinence
in subsequent years, and lavished enormous sums on
Christmas festivities.
We who are accustomed to associate gravity with
law, find it difficult to believe in the pranks and buf-
fooneries which the gentlemen of the Inns of Court
began to indulge in about this time, by way of cele-
brating Christmas. They held for that season
everything in mockery: they had a mock parliament,
a Prince of Sophie or Wisdom, an honourable order of
Pegasus, a high constable, marshal, a master of the
game, a ranger of the forest, lieutenant of the Tower,
which was a temporary prison for Christmas delinquents
-all the paraphernalia of a court. During the games
a huntsman came into the hall with nine or ten couple
of hounds, bearing on the end of his staff a purse-net
which held a fox and a cat; these were let loose and
hunted by the hounds, and killed beneath the fire.
All of this, and much more of the same sort, was but
the prelude to the feasting, when roast and boiled
smoked on the table, and wine and ale went round in
copious draughts, and pastime ended in debauchery.
Evelyn says in his Diary: 'I went to see the revells at
the Middle Temple, which is an old, but riotous custom,
and has no relation to virtue or policy-a proof how
little decorum, to say nothing of religion, pervaded the
celebration of Christmas by the long robe. The High
Jinks of the Scottish bar in a later time were refinement
in comparison.
into disuse, and encourage the poor by their hospi-
tality. Old Tusser's quatrain prescribed their duties—
'At Christmas be mery, and thanke God of all:
And feast thy poore neighbours, the great with the small.
Yea al the yere long have an eie to the poore:
And God shall sende luck, to kepe open thy doore.'
But when the Commonwealth came, Christmas fes-
tivities and holidays were forbidden as irreverent and
pernicious: conscientious people, among whom Bunyan
is mentioned, scrupled to eat mince-pies because of the
superstitious character popularly attached to them.
To many the enforcement of the scruples was a sore
grievance. One writer thus laments:-
'Gone are those golden days of yore,
When Christmass was a high day:
Whose sports we now shall see no more;
'Tis turned into Good-Friday.'
6
Later in the same century a chaplain on board one
of the ships of war describes the manner in which the
holiday was observed at sea: 'Crismas day,' he writes
in his diary, we keepe thus: at 4 in the morning
our trumpeters all doe flatt their trumpetts, and begin
at our captain's cabin, and thence to all the officers'
and gentlemen's cabins; playing a levite at each cabin
door, and bidding a good-morrow, wishing a merry
Crismas. After they goe to their station-namely, on
the poope, and sound three levitts in honour of the
morning. At 10 wee goe to prayers and sermon; text,
Zech. ix. 9. Our captaine had all his officers and
gentlemen to dinner with him, where wee had excellent
good fayre: a ribb of beife, plum-puddings, minct-
pyes, &c. and plenty of good wines of severall sorts;
dranke healths to the king, to our wives and friends,
and ended the day with much civill myrth.'
The singing of carols dates from the very earliest
period of Christmas celebration, when songs of glad-
ness were considered as appropriate to the occasion.
The song of the angels was among the first set to
music:-
Great power was always delegated to the Lord of
Misrule or, as we should say, the Master of the
Ceremonies for the time being. At the Christmas
holidays in 1634 the Right Worshipful Richard Evelyn,
Esq.-father of the author of the Diary-High Sheriff
and Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey and Sussex, drew up
'articles' regulating the functions and appointment of
a Lord of Misrule over his estate at Wotton. 'Im-
primis,' he writes, 'I give free leave to Owen Flood,
my trumpeter, gent., to be Lord of Misrule of all good
orders during the twelve days. And also I give free
leave to the said Owen Flood to command all and
every person or persons whatsoever, as well servants
as others, to be at his command whensoever he shall
sound his trumpet or music, and to do him good

No one was to be allowed to enter the kitchen to
annoy the cook; and if any man shall kiss any maid,
widow, or wife, except to bid welcome or farewell,

And last: 'I give full power and authority to his
lordship to break up all locks, bolts, bars, doors, and
latches, and to fling up all doors out of hinges to come
at those who presume to disobey his lordship's com-

Such liberty being permitted in a well-regulated
household, we may easily imagine that in others but
little restraint would be exercised; and so attractive
were the revels to country gentlemen, that many of
them passed their Christmas in London for the purpose
of attending them; but in 1589 they received orders
to depart forthwith to their respective counties, and
thereby maintain the ancient customs which had fallen
Or
'Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell !
To Mary thus spake Gabriell.'
Nowell, or with the French Noël, the name by which
Christmas is known in France, was a cry expressive
of great satisfaction or joy, and is supposed to be a
contraction of Emmanuel - God with us. Among the
carols formerly sung in that country there is one of
curious character, which is said to have been chanted
to a 'merry tune.' The first verse runs-
'Quand Dieu naquit à Noël
Dedans la Judée,
On vit ce jour solemnel
La joie inondée;
Il n'étoit ni petit ni grand
Qui n'apportat son présent,
Et n'o, n'o, n'o, n'o,
Et n'offrit, frit, frit,
Et n'o, n'o, et n'offrit,
Et n'offrit sans cesse Toute sa richesse.'

Sometimes every member of the festive party was
expected to sing a carol, or to pay a fine in case of
failure-the fine being rigidly enforced: a practical
exemplification of No Song, no Supper; in other instances
the caroling was performed by a single voice.
Southey writes-
"In his lord's castle dwelt, for many a year,
A well-beloved servant: he could sing
Carols for Shrovetide, or for Candlemas,
Songs for the wassel, and when the boar's head
Crowned with gay garlands, and with rosemary,
Smoked on the Christmas board.'
as Herrick says: neither is the singing of carols so
well honoured in the observance as formerly.
For our parts, we should be glad to see a revival
of carol-singing—that is, in a properly decorous spirit.
As There is something solemn and touching even now in
listening to the chant of the street - minstrels — the
waits as it rises through the silence of the night,
making one feel that peace and goodwill may become
something more than sound. And so, with a passage
from Shakspeare which embodies a few bygone super-
stitions, we conclude our illustrations of Christmas in
the Olden Time:
Old writers seem never to have tired of praising hos-
pitality. One who wrote more than two centuries ago
shews how much power of happiness lay in the hands
of a generous householder: Suppose Christmas now
approaching, the evergreen ivie trimming and adorning
the portals and portcloses of so frequented a building;
the usuall carolls to observe antiquitie, cheerfully
sounding; and that which is the complement of his
inferior comforts-his neighbours, whom he tenders as
members of his own family, joyne with him in this
consort of mirth and melody '-then we may presume
he had won their respect and gratitude for at least
another year. Old George Wither sings with gladsome
spirit-
'Now all our neighbours' chimneys smoke,
And Christmas blocks are burning;
Their ovens they with baked meat choke,
And all their spits are turning.
Without the door let sorrow lye;
And if for cold it hap to die,
We'll bury 't in a Christmas pie,
And evermore be merry.'
'Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.'
THE UNDER-SEA TELEGRAPH.
WE have of late been so much accustomed to great
achievements in science and art, that the establishment
of a telegraphic communication across the Channel is
regarded almost as a matter of course, calling for no
very special remark. But to be placed en rapport with
the continent, while preserving the integrity of our
insular position, is a triumph of ingenuity on which a
little attention may be worthily bestowed; and we
propose to trace a brief outline of the leading features
of its history.
It will be remembered that the first attempt was made
in August 1850, when a copper-wire, twenty-five miles
in length, coated with gutta-percha, and weighted with
leaden clamps, was sunk in the Channel from Dover to
Cape Gris-nez on the French coast. During the process
of sinking from the deck of the Goliah steamer, and
after the whole line was laid, the transmission of
electro - galvanic signals demonstrated the perfect
feasibility and success of the undertaking. The wire,
however, had been laid but a few days when it was
broken by chafing against the rocks on the shore, or
some other equally fatal accident; and the communi-
cation being thus suddenly broken off, we were still
dependent on the usual modes of forwarding intelli-
table.gence-the mail-boats and the clipper steamer kept for

very special occasions, which inquisitive travellers may
What the Christmas pie was may be understood from
the description of one published in a Newcastle paper
at the beginning of January 1770. Monday last was
brought from Howick to Berwick, to be shipped for
London, for Sir Hen. Grey, Bart., a pie, the contents
whereof are as follow-namely, 2 bushels of flour, 20
lbs. of butter, 4 geese, 2 turkeys, 2 rabbits, 4 wild
ducks, 2 woodcocks, 6 snipes, and 4 partridges; 2 neats'
tongues, 2 curlews, 7 blackbirds, and 6 pigeons: it is
supposed a very great curiosity; was made by Mrs
Dorothy Patterson, housekeeper at Howick. It was
near nine feet in circumference at bottom, weighs about
twelve stones, will take two men to present it to
It is neatly fitted with a case, and four small wheels to
facilitate its use to every guest that inclines to partake
of its contents at table.'
But times have changed. There is but little noisy
jollity in Christmas as at present celebrated: people go
no longer to see the Glastonbury thorn blow on the 25th
of December, either Old or New Style; nor visit cattle-
lairs at midnight of Christmas-Eve, to see the oxen
fall on their knees, as they are said to have done at the
time of the Nativity in the stable at Bethlehem-a
superstition which one would hardly expect to find
reproduced in Canada, where an Indian was detected
stealing out to see the deer kneel;' for, as he replied
to his questioner, 'It was Christmas night, when all the
deer fall upon their knees to the Great Spirit, and look
up.'
Neither do they consider that the multiplied
ingredients of mince-pies are symbolical of the various
offerings brought by the Wise men; or that it is neces-
sary to make them of a long and narrow shape to
represent a manger; or that eating them is a proof
of orthodoxy; or that for each variety of pie so eaten
so many happy days are in store for the eater. Neither
do they believe that the weather of the twelve days
of Christmas is prognosticative of that of the twelve
months in the following year; nor drink spiced ale,
or eat roasted apples before breakfast; nor wassail
the trees, that they may bear
6 Full many a plum, and many a pear,'
It was not likely that so important an enterprise
would be lightly abandoned. The Submarine Telegraph
Company was formed; and in July last, Mr Crampton
undertook to supply an efficient telegraphic communi-
cation by the end of September, and in accordance with
the conditions imposed by the French and English
tion at the company's works at Wapping; first, by
governments. The plans were carried into execu-
twisting together, by the aid of powerful steam machi-
nery, four copper-wires coated with gutta-percha, and
twenty-four miles in length. This core, as it may be
called, was next thickly covered with hempen strands
twisted spirally, and thoroughly saturated with a
preparation of pitch and tallow, and these in turn
were served' with similarly - prepared strands passing
transversely round them. The core, on which every-
thing depends, was thus protected by a double
covering closely compressed, and the whole was then
enveloped with ten strands of galvanised iron-wire,
each about a quarter-inch thick, twisting round and
perfectly enclosing it, the object being to prevent the
action of the sea-water upon the interior.
finished, the cable presented a remarkably bright and
polished appearance from the effects of the galvanising,
Its construction occupied three weeks, and the total
weight-sufficient to find its way to the bottom without
additional loading-was said to be 200 tons. As the

huge mass lay coiled up on the wharf previous to ship-
ment, the integrity of the core was tested by sending
an electric spark, and firing a fusee, through the whole
length of twenty-four miles.
By the 24th September the cable was safely coiled
in the hold of the Blazer, a steamer placed at the
service of the company by government, and towed
down to the South Foreland-the point of communica-
tion for the English side. Here one end of the cable
was landed, and hauled up the beach some distance
beyond high-water-mark to a spot near the lighthouse,
where a shaft, pierced perpendicularly from the top of
the cliff, receives the wires which are connected with
the telegraph at Dover. The necessary attachments
having been made, the Blazer, towed by two steam-
tugs, started for the opposite shore, notwithstanding
the blustrous weather; for, according to the terms of
agreement with the French government, the cable was
to be sunk into its place by the 1st of October. The
point selected for communication on the French side
was Sangatte, a small village standing on the dreary
dunes between three and four miles from Calais, said to
have been the spot whence Cæsar embarked for the
invasion of Britain. The beach at that part of the
coast is a fine smooth sand, eminently favourable for
the proposed object, and distant from the Foreland
twenty-one miles.
The Fearless steamer started a little in advance of
the Blazer, to shew the route to be followed. As the
latter went onwards the cable was slowly uncoiled,
and after passing through a series of brakes, intended
to prevent too rapid a movement, it was 'payed out'
over the stern. Owing to an accident which tore away
about eighteen yards of one of the outer wires, the
speed was reduced from five to two knots an hour; and
when six miles were laid down in this way, an attempt
was made to transmit a signal to the party on shore;
and after some delay, arising from the telegraphic
instrument not having been attached, it succeeded
perfectly. This was encouraging, and all promised
well for a successful termination, when the tow-rope
unfortunately broke, and the Blazer drifted a mile and
a half out of her course before the accident could be
repaired. She arrived, however, off Sangatte about six in
the evening of the 25th, having occupied ten hours in
the passage across; and the weather being stormy, she
anchored for the night two miles from the shore. The
next day a gale blew from the west, interfering seriously
with the prosecution of the work; but the Blazer was
towed to within a mile of the French coast, and the
remainder of the cable cast overboard there, with a
buoy attached to mark its position, and all the vessels
returned to the British side. The gale was still blowing
on Saturday the 26th, when Captain Bullock went with
the Fearless, and carried the end of the cable some
hundred yards nearer the shore. On the 27th the
weather moderated. Accordingly,' to quote from the
Times, the engineers and managers of the Gutta-Percha
Company took on board the Fearless a large coil of
gutta-percha roping, and after hauling up the end of
the telegraph-cable, the first wires were carefully
attached, and at half-past five in the afternoon a boat
landed them on the beach at Sangatte. The moment
chosen for landing was low-water, and the coil of
gutta-percha ropes was immediately buried in the
beach by a gang of men in attendance, up to low-water-
mark, and even a short distance beyond it. Thence to
where the cable was moored did not much exceed a
quarter of a mile.
'The telegraphs were instantly attached to the sub-
marine wires, and all the instruments responded to the
batteries from the opposite shores. At six o'clock
messages were printed at Sangatte from the South
Foreland, specimens of which Captain Bullock took
over to Dover the same evening for the Queen and the
Duke of Wellington.
'On Monday morning the wires at Sangatte were
joined to those already laid down to Calais, and two of
the instruments used by the French government having
been sent to the South Foreland, Paris was placed in
immediate communication with the English court.'
After
It is intended to replace the wires now carried across
the Sangatte beach by an additional length of cable
which will be spliced on to the main portion, and thus
make it of equal strength and durability throughout.
The possibility of electro-telegraphic communication
was, however, once more demonstrated, and shortly
afterwards the company announced themselves ready
to transmit messages in either direction across the
Channel. By that time, Nov. 13, the communication
between the Foreland and the offices at Dover was
completed, and instruments by Cooke and Wheatstone,
and Brett and Henley, were ready for work.
some little delay,' to quote again from the Times, 'con-
sequent on the rapidity with which the arrangements
were made, the wires were finally connected, and it
became a moment of intense anxiety when signals were
about to be passed. The instrument was set in motion,
signals were interchanged with Calais, and the complete
success of the undertaking was manifest. Very few
communications had passed when a mounted messenger
arrived with a dispatch from the telegraph office of
the South-Eastern Railway Company. It proved to
be a message containing the prices of the funds on the
London Exchange, which were to be immediately sent
on by the submarine telegraph to Paris. From this
time dispatches were continually passing between
the Dover telegraph offices and London and Paris. A
message from London was sent to Paris, and an answer
received and forwarded to London, within one hour, in
which time is included the journey of a mile from the
station to the office and back again, and to this must
be added the loss of time consequent on the message
having to be sent from the Paris office to the Paris
Bourse, and for the return of the reply.
'It was a happy coincidence that the day chosen
for the opening of the telegraph was that on which the
Duke of Wellington attended in person to close the
Harbour Sessions; and it was resolved by the promoters
that His Grace on leaving Dover by the two o'clock train
for London should be saluted by a gun fired by the
transmission of a current from Calais. It was arranged
with Calais that as the clock struck two, a signal was
immediately to be passed, and, punctual to the moment,
a loud report reverberated on the water, and shook the
ground with some force. It was then ascertained that
a thirty-two pounder, loaded with ten pounds of powder,
had been fired by the current. The report had scarcely
ceased ere it was taken up from the heights, the mili
tary, as usual, saluting the departure of the Duke with
a round of artillery. Guns were then fired successively
on both coasts, Calais firing the gun at Dover, and
Dover returning the compliment to Calais.'
Thursday the 13th November may thus be considered
as a memorable day. Henceforward winds may blow,
and billows roll, and delay the mails as long as they
will; but while the surface of the sea is agitated, the
swift intelligence will be flying along the metallic wires
lying undisturbed at the bottom. The social and poli-
tical advantages to grow out of instantaneous commu-
nication with all parts of the continent are as yet only
foreseen, and to be judged of by the result. Hitherto
the prices of public funds have been the principal sub-
jects of transmission. The Times, referring to the
Thursday in question, stated-The one o'clock opening
prices at the Paris Bourse to-day were received through
the submarine telegraph, and posted in the Stock
Exchange, by Mr T. Uzielli, at twenty minutes to
three. The two o'clock prices were also received before
the close of business, and during the afternoon a
transaction of some amount was effected in Russian
stock in consequence of an order transmitted in the

same manner.' Again, on Friday 14th, there appeared
in the same paper a brief sentence, headed: 'BY SUB-
MARINE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH - Paris, Thursday, 7
o'clock P.M.-The Assembly has rejected the Electoral
law by a majority of 355 against 348:' a striking illus-
tration of what may be done in the transmission of news.
Since then messages have been repeatedly sent from
Liverpool as well as London to France, Italy, and Ger-
many, and in one instance a communication was for-
warded to Cracow, to be despatched thence by mail
to Odessa.' Ordinary modes of communication will now
be greatly in arrear, seeing that we can get the pith
of all that is desirable to be known from any quarter
at a few minutes' notice and at any hour-from Mar-
seilles, Venice, St Petersburg, Pesth, Prague, or Vienna.
Governments will now be able to talk to one another
without long official delays, and save something in
ambassadors. It will be necessary, however, to have
some universal language which all may understand
without the necessity of translation, and to extend over
the whole of Europe the telegraphic union which has
been formed for part of Germany.
Mr Wheatstone first conceived the possibility of an
under-sea telegraph in 1837, and had half a mile of wire
covered with an insulating envelope prepared for the ex-
periment; but not being used, this wire was afterwards
employed for some of the earliest telegraphic trials on
the Birmingham Railway. In 1840, Mr Wheatstone
demonstrated the possibility by plans and drawings to
the governments of France, England, and Belgium, and
measures were taken for a practical application of the
principle, but without pushing them to a conclusion,
as the authorities were too much engaged with other
matters. Not so the present endeavour: its success is
no longer a question; and in time, as the rhymer
says, the electric impulse will be speeding
'Over-under-lands or seas,
To the far antipodes.
Now o'er cities thronged with men,
Forest now or lonely glen;
Now where busy Commerce broods,
Now in wildest solitudes;
Now where Christian temples stand,
Now afar in pagan land.
Here again as soon as gone,
Making all the earth as one.
Moscow speaks at twelve o'clock,
London reads ere noon the shock;
Seems it not a feat sublime,
Intellect hath conquered Time !'
THE BLIND FIDDLER.
ONE dismally foggy and rainy afternoon in November
last, when the streets, clothed in a viscid garment of
thick and slippery mud, were passable only at a snail's
pace, because every step forward sent you half a step back
again-when no one whom fate, or equally inexorable
business, did not drive forth, ventured to brave the
misty atmosphere fraught with catarrh and influenza-
I heard the sound of a fiddle outside my window. The
strain was a melancholy attempt at a Scotch reel; and
the incongruity of the spectacle it conjured up to my
imagination compared with the actual scene before my
eyes had just awaked me to the perception of the comic,
when the music ceased on a sudden in the middle of the
second stave, and I heard the sound of a fall; and a
faint ejaculation, half-sigh, half-groan, which imme-
diately followed, brought me to the door to see what
was the matter.
It was already getting dark, independently of the fog,
and I could but dimly discern a dusky mass lying by
the garden gate; but I could hear the plaintive moans
that proceeded from it, and soon, with the help of
Betty, whom I had summoned to my assistance, got the
wretched bundle of humanity into a chair in front of
the glowing kitchen fire. A few spoonfuls of diluted
brandy soon brought life and animation into a weather-
beaten face, and produced from livid lips the eager,
almost savage request: For God's sake, give me a bit
of vittles!'
'When did you eat last?'
'Not since yesterday morning. I had a bit of bread
yesterday morning.'
'Oh!' said Betty, aint that horrid, and he a blind
man-as blind as a stone?' Giving the necessary direc-
tions, I left Betty to manage her blind patient in her
own way, and in about an hour afterwards went down
to see what improvement she had effected.
The poor fellow, having satisfied the demands of
nature, and supplied his own wants, had immediately
began to attend to those of his inseparable companion
-his cracked, patched, and dilapidated fiddle. I found
him airing it tenderly before the fire; then, having
borrowed a cloth from Betty, he employed himself in
cleansing the crazy instrument from the moist breath
of the fog, and from the contaminations it had picked
up through his fall. This accomplished, he began
feeling it all over as cautiously as a surgeon does the
body of a patient in search of a fracture. Fortunately
there was no serious mischief done, and the poor fellow
laughed cheerfully when he discovered that the only
friend he had in the world had escaped unhurt.
'Well, my man,' said I, 'how do you get on? Not
hungry now, I hope?'
'Bless 'ee, sir, no! I'm righter than a trivet now,
sir. I ha'nt had sich a feed I can't tell 'ee when,
sir. I'm very much obleeged to you, sir, surely. I
wor altogether done up, and that's a fact.'
'Well, then, perhaps you have no objection to return
the favour we have done you by telling me how you
came to be a blind fiddler, what you get by it, how you
manage to live, and all about it!'
'Not a bit of objection in the world, sir, if you likes
to hear it. There aint much fun in what I got to tell
though, cos I ha'nt had much luck in my time: but if
you wish to hear it, of course you shall, and I'll begin
at the beginning. I'm quite agreeable, sir.'
With that, laying his fiddle to rest in an old black
bag which he drew from the crown of a crushed hat,
and settling his arms on the elbows of the chair, so
as to rest his whole frame in a state of unaccustomed
luxury, he delivered himself literally, with the excep-
tion of certain circumlocutions which I have thought
fit to digest into something like order and consecu-
tiveness, pretty much to the following effect:-
'I aint but a youngish man, sir, though they do tell
me that I looks a reg'lar old file. What might you
suppose my age, sir?'
"From forty-eight to fifty, or thereabouts.'
"There 'tis agin. Everybody says I'm fifty, when
I'm not forty yet. I was born in 1811, sir, in Swan
Alley, not far from the Artillery Ground. My father
war a shoemaker-perhaps I ought to say a cobbler,
for he didn't make many shoes: good reason why,
he was always a mendin' on 'em. When I was a
very little un, I rek'lect partik'lar they was a-makin'
the Regent's Canal as runs under the City Road,
and I used to get out afore I was big enough to
wear trousers, and make mud-pies out of the clay as
was turned up. That was the best fun I ever knowed,
that was; but didn't I get the strap when my father
catched me at it? Ah, I knows what strap-sauce is
well enough! He wanted to teach me cos I was the
biggest boy-to make wax-ends, and I wanted to make
mud-pies; and many's the lickin' I got along o' that
there canal a-diggin'. I never passes the bridge now
without thinkin' on it. Then, you know, I could see-
had as good use of my eyes as anybody. Ha! well!
'taint no use grievin'.

'Mother died, and left four on us when I was about
five years old, and then we got more strap and less
vittles, I can tell 'ee. Father got savage, an' took to
drinkin', and we never dared to have a bit o' lark 'cept
when he was out o' doors. One night, when he was
gone to the public - house, we was all a-playin' and
larkin' in the room, and my brother, out o' fun, pushed
me right over the kit into the fire. I fell with my
face slap in the middle of the hot coals, and was so
frightened that I couldn't make no attempt to get out,
cos my legs was up in the air again' the kit. My two
brothers and sister sung out a good un, and a coman
as lived up-stairs came down and picked me out. I
was took off to the hospital, where I laid for seven
months, and a'most died wi' brain-fever. Then I was
sent home again, stone-blind, and father give me a
hidin' for tumblin' into the fire, as if I hadn't had
punishment enough. But I didn't care much for that.
I had friends in the court, among the women and the
gals, and I got a deal more vittles and kindness than I
did afore.
'When I was old enough, I was sent to the Blind
Asylum, where I learned to make baskets and mats.
I can make clothes-baskets and hampers, and that sort
of work, well enough; but the trade is so much cut up
by the shops that it aint worth doin'. If I makes a
basket for a washerwoman for three shillins, it costs
me half-a-crown for the willows. It aint much better
with the mats-the rope costs almost the money they
fetch. I left the asylum when I was sixteen, and lived
along with another blind man as made hampers for the
wine-merchants. He had a pretty good trade, and I
might ha' done well along of him if I could ha' carr'd
home the goods; but it aint no go for a blind man to
get about the streets o' London wi' five or six hampers
on his head. I tried it once or twice, and got shoved
head-foremost into a butcher's shop by some chaps as
wanted a lark; so he couldn't send me out no more,
and he couldn't go hisself. I had two years of that
there hamper-work, and got the rheumatiz dreadful
through workin' in a damp cellar all day long, and I
was obliged to give it up-to go into the hospital again.
'When I came out I didn't know where to go, and
what I was to do. My father had moved away some-
where, and my two brothers had gone to sea. So I
went to my parish, and had a go of the workhouse for
matter of a year. There was a blind man in there as
played the fiddle uncommon well, and the overseer
made him shew me a bit, and paid a goodish bit o'
money for teachin' of me. I scraped away whenever
they would let me, for I wanted to get out of the work-
house, and I picked up a tidy lot of tunes in four or
five months. By the time I'd a been at it a year, I
thought I might manage to pick up a livin', and I
turned out one mornin', when the summer was a-comin'
on, and began fiddlin' in the streets. I didn't get much
the first day-not quite sixpence I think 'twas-but I
wouldn't go back upon the parish. I could lodge for a
shillin' a week, and I could get a bit of broken vittles
at times when folks wouldn't give me no money. I
liked my liberty too well, after the confinement-first
of the damp cellar, then of the hospital, and then in the
workhouse-and I made up my mind to get my own
livin' without bein' beholden to nobody. So I've
a-fiddled pretty well ever since.
"When I were two-and-twenty, I took it into my
head uncommon as how I should like to learn to read;
so I went and applied at the Blind School in Red Lion
Square, and used to go there and learn to read two or
three nights of a week. There was a good many there,
and some on 'em learned to read very well, and some
couldn't learn nohow. I got on tolerablish. I went to
the school more nor a year. We didn't pay nothin' for
teachin'-only for the books: the books is very dear;
the letters sticks up, and we feels 'em with our fingers.
I gave four shillins for Izayer. I can read all on it,
and John's Gospel too. That's all I got. I can't afford
to buy no more.
'At the Blind School I fell in with a young ooman
as was learnin' to read. I kep company with her for
five year, and then I married her. We've a been
married nigh upon twelve year. She was born blind-
never had no eyes in her head, not at all. She can do
everything in a house as well a'most as them as can
see: she can cook a meal's vittles beautiful, when we
got it to be cooked. She sews with her needle, and
mends my clothes, and does the washin' and ironin'.
We are often very bad off, partik'lar at this time of the
year. People don't care much about fiddlin' and music
in cold and wet weather: they walks away to keep
theirselves warm; and forgits to give a fellar a copper.
'I knows London all over 'cept some of the new
streets, and I knows them when I been through 'em
once. I goes from Islington, where I lives, to the City,
three times a week. When I come to a street where a
customer of mine lives, I begins and numbers the
houses with my stick, and then I strikes up when I
comes to the house, and plays till I gets my penny or
my bread and cheese. I always eats a piece of bread
in the mornin' afore I goes out: if I don't, I gits the
stomach-ache. Sometimes I don't git no more all the
day; but I gits bread and cheese at a house in Clerken-
well every Tuesday, and a good pint o' tea and a poun'
a'most o' bread every Friday in Little Saint Thomas
Apostle. You see I can't fiddle very well, cos my right
arm is shrivelled up wi' the fire, and I can't draw the
bow rightly level with the bridge athout I sits down;
and in course I can't sit down while I am walkin' about
the streets; so it aint many coppers I gits from chance
customers. My reg'lar customers mostly gives me a
penny a week: when they moves, I follers 'em wherever
they goes: I can't afford to lose 'em; they brings me
in, all on 'em, about three-and-sixpence a week, besides
the vittles. "Taint much vittles I eats at home, save
on Sundays, and a bit o' bread for breakfast afore I
starts out of a mornin'.
'There's lots o' blind men in London as gets a livin'
without earnin' of it. I knows one as sits all day in
the City Road a-readin' the Bible wi' his finger, and
people thinks it's wonderful clever, and gives him a sight
o' money. A poun' a week aint nothin' to him. But
that there's a imposition; there aint nothin' in it. I
can read as well as he every bit; but people hadn't
ought to get their bread by readin' the Bible and doin'
of nothin': it aint respectable. I gives the people
music: if they don't think it worth nothin', they gives
me nothin' for it; if they do, they gives me a copper,
and very glad to git it. There's some blind men as
keeps standins in the street, and sells sticks, and braces,
and padlocks, and key-rings; some on 'em drives a
good trade. I knows one as got a family brought up
quite respectable-the boys is 'prentices, and the gals
goes to service. I should like to keep a standin' myself
if I had a few poun's to begin with; but, Lord! I never
had but one sovereign in my hand in my life, and that
wasn't mine. There's lots o' blind men goes about wi'
dogs tied to a string: them's beggars. When a blind
man drives a dog, he've a made up his mind to be a
gentleman. A dog aint of no real use to a blind man
in London-not a bit in the world. A dog is a blind
beggar's sign; and when the dog carries a tray in his
mouth to catch the coppers, then there's two beggars
instead o' one. There's a sight o' blind men in London
as can see as well as you can. They starts out when
'tis dark wi' great patches over their eyes, and goes
with a boy-a young thief-to lead 'em, among the
crowds and in the markets of a Saturday night. When
they gets into the thick of it they sings out:
Christians! for the love of Heaven bestow your charity
upon the poor blind-and God preserve your precious
eyesight." That's their chant. They gits a lot o' money
from the people, partik'lar on Saturday nights, when the

small change is flyin' about: them's robbers, an' nothin'
else. There's some poor fellows as I knows as can't do
nothin' for a livin'. Blind men is often weak in the
head -a bit silly-like. They mostly lives in work-
houses; sometimes they tries it on wi' lucifer-matches:
they likes to get out in the sun in summer-time and
fine weather: I pities them, poor fellows! 'tis hard
luck they've got.
'I'm always cheerful-minded 'cept when I'm very
hungry and got nothin' to take home to my wife. We
don't want much-'tis very little as keeps her; but I
don't like to go home without nothin' in my pocket:
then I sometimes thinks 'tis too bad, and gets low-
spirited; but I soon goes to sleep and forgits it, cos I'm
so tired when I goes home. My wife earns somethin'
most weeks; sometimes she looks arter little children
when their mothers goes out a-charin'. She haves three-
halfpence a day for a child: when we got two babies
for a week that makes eighteenpence, and pays the
rent. A good thing that would be if we could do it
always. She's very fond o' little babies, and knows
how to do for 'em as well as a mother a'most, though
she never had none of her own.
'Saturday's my best day. My customers knows I
can't play the fiddle of a Sunday, and so I gits a good
allowance of vittles, and fills my bag. Thus a butcher
not far off as gives me a reg'lar good stew o' bones an'
cuttin's every Saturday night. That's my Sunday's
dinner, and a famous dinner my wife makes on it.
There's a policeman out here as collars me reg'lar
whenever my bag's a bit full, and turns it all out, and
axes me where I stole it. I says: "I'll answer that
there question at the station-house, if you likes to take
me there;" but he never takes me up. That's a noo-
sance, that is.
'I never buys no clothes; I git as much as I want
gave me. The boots is the worst. In course I never
gits them till they're worn out; and as I can't afford
to have 'em mended, when it rains my feet is always in
the wet; but I'm pretty well used it—that's one good
thing. This time o' the year 'tis very bad: there is so
much bad weather, and so few people about, a blind
fiddler might as well stay at home. There's been
nothin' but rain all the week. I only earned twopence
yesterday, and that just made up the rent as was over-
due: there was nothin' for supper, though I'd had
nothin' all day but a bit o' bread in the mornin', and
to-day there was none for me to have, so I come away
without any. My wife have had her vittles to-day,
that's one comfort: she went out afore I did to go
a-washin'; she'll earn sixpence besides her vittles-and
we shall have a good supper to-night, thank God!
'I've had a good many accidents in my time. There
is so many omnibuses now, that a blind man can't
venture off the pavement. It takes me half an hour
sometimes to get across from the "Angel" into the City
Road. I've been knocked down by cabs and omnibuses
six or seven times; I never got much hurt myself, but
my fiddle have been broke all to pieces several times.
I always mend it myself, but it's a deal o' trouble and
loss of time while the glue's a-dryin'. Drunken men
is worse than omnibuses. I've been beat about by
drunken men many's the time, cos I couldn't play the
tunes they wanted. I never goes into a public-house
now: I had so many tricks put upon me, that I finds
it better to keep away. I was a'most killed once by a
lot o' Irishmen: they knocked me about dreadful, and
filled my fiddle full o' beer, and then made me play
upon it, and cut the strings while I was a-playin'.
They done that cos I'm a very little fellow, and got no
strength. That's too bad! Sometimes gentlefolks is
none too civil. Just afore I come to your gate, I tried
at a house a little way down the road: a gentleman
come a-rushin' out, catches me by the throat, and
twistis me roun' and roun', and shoves me over the
steps, a-swearin' as how he'd got two scrapers at his
door a'ready, and didn't want another. That aint
civil, seein' I fiddles as well as I can, and he got no call
to pay for it if he ha'nt a mind to.
I don't know as I can tell you anythin' more, sir.
You see I don't know much of the world. All days is
pretty much alike to me: wet or dry, hot or cold, is
all the difference between one day and another. We
does the best we can. When the sun shines, and people
walks about and enjoys theirselves, I gits a little
money, and my wife and I is cheerful and contented.
When the bad wintry weather comes down upon us, we
do feel what it is to be hungry and poor; but we can't
help it, and it aint no use frettin'. We might git into
the workhouse in the winter if we liked, but then we
must sell up all our sticks, and I should lose all my
customers where I plays reg'lar, and have to begin the
world agin when we come out in the summer. It
wouldn't do, that wouldn't.
'My wife's a merry little ooman, and can go without
a dinner and never grumble: many's the day she gits
no vittles, no more than myself. When there aint no
vittles in the cupboard, and no means of earnin' any,
I tells her not to git up, and so she lies abed all day,
cos 'tis easier fastin' in bed than when you are up and
about. If I brings home anythin', then she gits up
and cooks it, and then we're all right. We always
hopes for better times, and if we don't live to see 'em,
why then we shan't grieve for the want of 'em. I
plays the song, There's a good time comin', boys, and
my wife sings it. There's no harm in hopin' that we
may all live to see it. That's all I've got to say, sir.'
With that this uncomplaining heir of adverse
fortune rose from his seat, placed his fiddle under his
arm, and thanking me warmly for all favours, groped
his way up the kitchen stairs and took his departure.
I have given his history as he detailed it: it has had
no colouring and requires no comment at my hands.
It is just one of those revelations of the mysteries of
common life which are only remarkable because the
world in general has not chosen to make them object
of remark. But verily it has a use and a signification
which discontented respectability, cushioned in its
easy-chair, may do well to ponder.
THINGS TALKED OF IN LONDON.
December 1851.
As usual, the approach of the winter solstice wakes us
up from the inactivity produced by autumnal holidays,
and law, physic, and philosophy, to say nothing of
pleasure, are girding up their loins for what is to
happen next. Michaelmas term having come and
gone, clients are wondering whether Hilary, which is
close at hand, will prove propitious-and so there is
excitement of some kind for all parties. Our societies,
philosophical, scientific, and otherwise, are bestirring
themselves, have opened their sessions with more or
less of éclat, and stretched out their plan of action for
the next six months, which in most instances differs
but little from the accustomed routine. The Royal
Society have held their anniversary, on which occa-
sion Lord Rosse, the president, delivered his annual
address to the Fellows-being a resumé of scientific
memorabilia, with obituary notices of deceased savans—
and presented the Copley Medal to Professor Owen for
his zoological researches; one of the Royal Medals to
Mr Newport for his investigations into the subject of
the reproduction of animal life by impregnation as
exemplified in amphibia - said to be by competent
judges one of the most remarkable and important
contributions to microscopic anatomy that has of late
made its appearance. The second Royal Medal had
been awarded to Lord Rosse himself for his astrono-
mical labours, chiefly with reference to Observations
on the Nebula-those extraordinary stellar bodies
of which the monster telescope has already rendered

some account, and will yet render more-the golden
testimonial was consequently handed to him by the
vice-president. Then followed the election of the new
council, and the English bond of brotherhood- -a
dinner. Besides all this the Royal Society have had
another paper from Faraday, still further extending
and confirming the discoveries in electricity and mag-
netism, which have so long engaged the attention of
that distinguished philosopher. Mr Wheatstone, too,
has given them some additional instances of his inven-
tive genius in his paper on the phenomena of what is
called binocular vision, as illustrated by that asto-
nishing instrument, the stereoscope. You look through
two eye-pieces at two pictures precisely alike placed in
a dark chamber, when the effect is such that the two
appear as one only, but in full and most striking relief:
in spite of yourself you are obliged to believe that the
figures and objects are raised, standing out round even
to the minutest details, while the background seems to
have receded to a considerable distance. Still more
marvellous is the pseudoscope-an instrument similar
in principle, but playing such pranks with the pheno-
mena of vision, that all ordinary notions of the subject
resolve themselves into amazement, and ordinary words
are inadequate to express the combinations. Things
which are farthest off appear the nearest, a globe is no
longer a globe but a basin, convex is concave, and
solid is hollow! After this, who shall aver that seeing is
believing? There will be something else to say on this
matter before long. Meantime I may tell you that the
first of the twelve Prince-Albert-authorised lectures
has been delivered at the Society of Arts by the
Master of Trinity, Dr Whewell; the others will follow
forthwith; and as they will doubtless be published,
students who cannot come to town will have an oppor-
tunity of reading them.
-
Among a select few, certain new combinations and
applications in electro-telegraphy are talked about, which
greatly excel all that has yet been accomplished in that
wondrous science. If all go well with the inventor, we
are to see the results next year. Enterprise is still
busy with that which is accomplished: an additional
cable, similar to the one sunk across the Channel, has
been advertised for ingenious brains are at work
trying to devise a system of universal symbols which
may be used and understood by all nations alike in
their telegraphic communications; and, more than all,
Steinheil is reported to have discovered a means for
sending a concentrated shock or flash to any distance
along the wires without the necessity of repeating it at
intermediate stations. Thus, as Tennyson says, we
are ever waking upon 'science grown to more.'
6
There are so many things talked about at our
scientific gatherings that it would be hopeless to
attempt to report one-half of them: we can only deal
with the most important. Among these Mr Mercer's
patent process for contracting the fibres of calico, and
of obtaining on the calico thus prepared colours of
much brilliancy,' is still regarded by chemists as likely
to lead to valuable results. This was brought forward
at the last meeting of the British Association, and
described as the discovery that 'a solution of cold but
caustic soda acts peculiarly on cotton fibre, immediately
causing it to contract; and although the soda can be
readily washed out, yet the fibre has undergone a
change. Thus, taking a coarse cotton fabric, and
acting upon it by the proper solution of caustic soda,
this could be made much finer in appearance; and if
the finest calico made in England-known as 180 picks
to the web-be thus acted on, it immediately appears as
fine as 260 picks. Stockings of open weaving assume
a much finer texture by the condensation process; but
the effect of the alteration is most strikingly shewn
by colours: the tint of pink cotton velvet becomes
deepened to an intense degree; and printed calicoes,
especially with colours hitherto applied with little
satisfaction-such as lilac-come out with strength and
brilliancy, besides producing fabrics cheaply, finer than
can be possibly woven by hand.' The strength, too, is
increased by this process; for a string of calico which
breaks with a weight of thirteen ounces when not
soaked, will bear twenty ounces when half condensed
by the caustic soda.
Our neighbours across the Channel have not been
idle, as you would believe could you see the numerous
communications submitted to the French Académie.
M. A. Dumont has sent one entitled 'Experiments on
the application of electro-magnetism as a motive power,'
in the description of which he states, that if in the
production of great power the electro-magnetic force is
inferior to that of steam, it becomes equal to it, and
perhaps superior in the production of small power,
which may be subdivided, varied, and introduced into
employments or trades requiring but little capital, and
where the absolute value of the mechanical power is
less essential than the facility of producing instan-
taneously and at pleasure the power itself." In this
point of view electro-magnetic power comes to com-
plete, not to supersede, that of steam.
In connection with these results I may tell you of
those obtained by M. Baumgartner in another part of
the continent. With respect to the effects of atmo-
spheric electricity on telegraph wires, he says that
the deflections produced are of two kinds-small and
great, and that the law of the former is discoverable.
'The observations made at Vienna and at Grätz appear
to shew that during the same day the electric currents
move from those two places to Sömmering, which is
more elevated. During the night the direction is
reversed, and the change takes place after the rising
and setting of the sun. The regular current, too, is
less disturbed by the irregular currents when the air
is dry and the sky serene, than when the weather is
rainy.'
While the northern line from Vienna was being
fixed, the workmen frequently complained of a kind
of spasms which they felt in handling the wires,' but
which 'ceased as soon as they took the precaution not
to touch the wires with naked hands. These spasms
were most frequent and intense in Styria, the highest
region of the line. Thus, near Kranichfeld, a workman
received a shock sufficiently violent to throw him down
and paralyse his right arm.
'On the 17th August 1849, a storm which had broken
out at Olmütz extended to Frielitz, a distance of ten
miles. A workman employed at this latter station,
while fixing the wires, was also thrown down by a
sudden shock, and those parts of his fingers which had
touched the wires appeared as if burnt. At this time
the sky was perfectly serene at Frielitz.'
You will perhaps exclaim here: Enough of mag-
netism for the present;' had the facts, however, been
less important than they are acknowledged to be, I
should not have dwelt so long on them. Now, to
return to the Académie. M. Lewy has brought
from New Granada the Arracacha, an esculent which
he hopes may be introduced into France, as a resource
in case of future potato disease. It possesses many
valuable properties, but does not transplant easily.
We are told that a M. Goudot lost his life in 1847 in
his attempt to enrich his country with this precious
alimentary root.' Other academicians are discussing
the subject of cedron (Sinaba cedron), which I men-
tioned a short time since as a newly-discovered
remedy against serpent-bites and intermittent fever.
It has been subjected to chemical analysis, and the
active principle shewn to be cedrine, more persistent
and intensely bitter than strychnine. A further
quantity of the seeds has been received, and if they
possess a real therapeutic value, the medical world will
soon be instructed of the fact.
M. J. Durocher states that he has succeeded in

mountain formations and stratifications on a small
scale, by the cooling of a heated mass of mineral and
earthy substances. If true, this may give us some
insight into the modus operandi of nature in the pheno-
mena of geology: at all events, out of such experiments
as the two here mentioned a practical benefit sometimes
proceeds, as chemical discovery did out of alchemy; and
perhaps they may have a bearing on the prize-question
proposed by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin:
100 ducats will be given for the best work on the
nature and mode of action, and resulting constitution,
of hydraulic mortar, including the constitution of
zeolites generally, but especially of those produced
in the solidification of mortar.' The essays may be
written in French, German, or Latin, at the pleasure
of the author: they are to be sent in by March 1854,
and the prize will be awarded in the following month
of July. Now that subaqueous and subterrene struc-
tures are becoming more and more a necessity, this
question is the more important.
Next to touch on physiology: M. Plouviez finds that
in cases of suspended animation from the use of chloro-
form, 95 per cent. of the cases may be saved by
insufflation, and 75 per cent. by alternate pressure of
the breast and abdomen. He shews also that asphyxia,
or suspended animation from drowning, is a more
serious matter, because in addition to the chill there
is the constant introduction of water into the terminal
bronchi-a fact, as he says, not sufficiently regarded, |
but one which effectually prevents the due penetration
of air, as is shewn by the dissection of animals which
have perished by drowning. He states further, that
three minutes' submersion produces the most complete
signs of death, when, if the animal be taken out and
laid on a table, the beatings of the heart can be no
longer felt; but if an acupuncturating needle be
plunged into this organ it oscillates strongly until the
ninth or tenth minute, and sometimes a little longer.
Never,' he continues, 'have I seen the oscillations
cease at the end of two or three minutes except the
stay in the water has been prolonged beyond five
minutes.' At times not the least drop of blood would
follow incisions made on different parts of the body;
but as soon as animation began to revive the wounds
began to bleed, 'proving that the capillary circulation
had been momentarily destroyed notwithstanding the
oscillations of the needle, which clearly indicated a
movement in the heart, but not sufficient to force the
blood into the remoter branches of the circulatory
system. It has thus never once happened to me to be
able to restore an animal to life in which the needle
had ceased to vibrate, while cerebral life has often
been seen to return when the capillary circulation had
ceased.'
M. Plouviez concludes his remarks with a few prac-
tical suggestions, and shews that the water which may
have lodged in the air-passages near the throat may be
made to escape by a conformable position of the body,
and that it cannot be removed, as is supposed, by means
of a pump. Place the body,' he says, 'out of the
reach of cold; let the head incline downwards, and
open the mouth to let the water flow out; all of which
will not occupy more than twenty seconds.
Mr Hill of New York has succeeded in fixing colours
by photography, and produces what he calls Hillotypes.
He says: 'I have forty-five specimens, all of which
present the several colours, true to a tint, and with a
degree of brilliancy never seen in the richest Daguerreo-
type; and this is true also of the whites and blacks.
The pictures have much the appearance of enamelling,
and I believe are equally durable; for it is very diffi-
cult to efface them by scouring, and, as far as I can
judge, they are not acted upon by light. My success
in quickening the plates has been equally gratifying;
and I have but little doubt of being able to operate in
diffusing light instantaneously, having already reduced
the time of sitting to much less than that required for
Daguerreotyping. I have never yet made a partial
failure. The folds of the linen are always well defined.
Blue or solarised linen is unknown in my process,
and there is always a strength and clearness in the
whites unattainable by mercury. During the last
winter I have several times taken a view, in which
there is a deep-red house, while the ground was covered
with snow. For experiment, I exposed the plate so
long as to reduce the bright red of the house to a very
light red, while at the same time the white snow was
developed with a beautiful whiteness.' After this,
seeing that Becquerel is working at the same subject,
and that prizes are offered for improvements in photo-
graphy, we may expect to see something excellent.
Our meteorologists are much interested by a report
recently published by Dr Buist, of the observatory at
Bombay, on the rainy season of 1849, the most remark-
able which has occurred in India during the present
century. Extreme drought prevailed for a time most
partially and capriciously. From the 22d to the 24th
of June an extraordinary and violent atmospheric com-
motion took place over the whole region, from Calcutta
to Aden, a distance of three thousand miles, and the
barometer fell almost unprecedentedly low. Hurricane
storms followed. At Bombay sixteen inches of rain
fell in three days, and from that time there were con-
tinual falls in different parts of the country. The dis-
turbance was not confined to tropical latitudes, for, as
many persons will remember, one of the most furious
rain and hail storms on record broke out in the south
of England on the 26th July. The disturbance was
accompanied, too, by anomalous conditions. At Madras
the air was dry, although rain fell heavily; while at
Aden it was precisely the reverse. At Mahabaleeshwar
hail fell without interruption from the 27th to the 29th
of July; and yet in some places rain was so scarce that
famine seemed imminent, and the plantations of sugar-
cane were pulled up to keep the cattle alive. Then in
August, the rivers of the Punjaub, owing to the heavy
fall in the mountains of the north-western frontier,
devastated the country on either side, and the Jhylum,
fed with water from the hills of Cashmere, came
down with overwhelming fury. At Shahpore, the
government salt-stores were washed away; as also the

cantonments of the British troops, who were forced to a
hasty retreat of five miles. The river burst through
all its barriers, and flooded the country for hundreds of
leagues. As the report states, the bastions, outworks,
and other works of Mooltan, which a year before had
for four months defied all the efforts of our artillery,
melted into the flood. On the 16th three magnificent
domes fell, and at seven on the morning of the 17th the
enormous cupola of the Bahawal Huk came thundering
to the ground with a noise like the explosion of a
tremendous mine. The whole structures were built of
unburnt bricks.' Such a flood, it is said, has never yet
been known in India. It went all down the course of
the Indus. At Hyderabad, also, in Southern India, the
Godavery burst into the city, levelling all the buildings
in its way, and rose until the highest parts of the
town were three feet under water. Such, in brief, is
the substance of Dr Buist's report, the most compre-
hensive, perhaps, which has ever appeared on the
meteorological phenomena of India.
"
You will remember my telling you of Dr Knoblecher's
Nile discoveries. They have excited the most lively
interest in our Geographical Society, and serve as a
counterpoise to the enthusiasm got up for Lieutenant
Pim, who is to go to the shores of Siberia-if the Em-
peror Nicholas will let him-to look for Sir John
Franklin: a forlorn-hope. But to come back to the
Nile it is now supposed that further researches will
tend to confirm the statements made by Ptolemy so
many centuries ago. The discovery of the mysterious
sources of the giant stream of the African continent,
the largest river of the Old World, perhaps even of the
entire globe, remains,' we are now told, the greatest
problem of geography.' These sources, it is believed,
will be found not far from Kenia, some 370 geographi-
cal miles beyond the farthest point yet reached by
Knoblecher. Lake Tchad, too, being explored by an
English boat, so that some day we may expect Africa
will cease to be a 'problem.' Meantime the interior of
Australia is a problem, and people are beginning to
inquire after the missing Leichardt as well as the
missing Franklin. And after all, there still remains
that undiscovered Kafiristan, somewhere to the north-
west of India, which, though long termed the opprobrium
of British geography, is yet a problem.
A little item from St Petersburg, and I close. M.
Bouniakowsky has presented to the Imperial Academy
of Sciences a paper on a 'curious application of the law
of probabilities to the approximate determination of the
limits of the real loss of men experienced by a troop
during battle.' The object is to give mathematical
formulæ, whereby the proposed results may be arrived
at any time during an engagement, as well as after it.
It is a question, however, whether captains and colonels
will be willing to stop in the middle of the strife to
work a sum. You will perhaps say, what few will care
to gainsay, that M. Bouniakowsky might devote his cal-
culations to a more peaceful purpose. And so I close
this year's gossip by wishing you a Merry Christmas.
'GOOD TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY.'
BY THE REV. JAMES GILBORNE LYONS, LLD.
OH! sweep the loud harp's tuneful strings,
Break forth, like song-birds after showers,
To tell how He-the King of kings-
Came to this ruined world of ours.
If angels beamed on Judah's hills,
And bid those watchers then rejoice,
Shall we, whose ears that message fills,
Mock with cold hearts the sacred voice?
When He-the Son of God-was born,
We walked in darkness far astray;
But, fair as Greenland's arctic morn,
He chased our long, drear night away.
His head that manger cradle pressed-
Ile toiled and suffered many a year,
To give the fainting nations rest,
To dry the mourner's bitter tear.
Who, who that ever breathed on earth-
Bard, prophet, hero, saint, or sage—
Gave cause like this for righteous mirth
To men of every clime and age?
Oh! it were shameful and unwise
Before those waning lights to fall,
Yet look with cold and careless eyes
On HIM-THE CENTRAL SUN OF ALL.
Go, tell the trembling slave of guilt,
Whose breast is sad, whose eye is diin,
The Just One's sacred blood was spilt,
To win back Heaven's lost smile for him.
All, all may join His glorious bands
In that far world of light and bliss,
Who keep His pure and high commands
With meek and faithful hearts in this!

A NEW WORK, IN MONTHLY VOLUMES, PRICE SIXPENCE EACH,
PAPER COVERS.
First Volume just issued.
THE demand for a light and entertaining class of books for perusal
on Railways, has induced us, as it has done other publishers, to
prepare a series of cheap and handy volumes, accessible to all.
The Work consists partly of amusing papers reprinted from the
early quarto volumes of CHAMBERS'S EDINBURGH JOURNAL
- now irrecoverably out of print, and unknown to the young
generation of readers-and partly of articles of a similar kind
for which space has not been found in the current numbers of that
periodical. In short, this Pocket Miscellany may, in a limited
sense, be considered a supplementary CHAMBERS'S JOURNAL,'
and is respectfully offered as a literary companion for the RAIL-
way, the FIRESIDE, or the BUSH.
Sold by all Booksellers.
W. & R. C.
The present number of the Journal completes the Sixteenth
Volume (new scries), for which a title-page and index have been
prepared, and may be had of the publishers and their agents.
END OF SIXTEENTH VOLUME.
Printed and Published by W. and R. CHAMBERS, Edinburgh.
Sold by W. S. ОRR, Amen Corner, London.
