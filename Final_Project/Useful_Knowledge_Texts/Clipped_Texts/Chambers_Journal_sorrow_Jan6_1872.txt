CHAPTER I.-CANDIDATES.
MIRIAM CLINT was about to leave school. She
was not glad of it. She was eighteen years old,
and had her notions and her visions about 'coming
out,' like other girls of her age, and especially of
her appearance. The time to which these notions
would naturally have tended, and these visions
soared, was at hand, and yet Miriam Clint was
not glad of it. This is a paradox which requires
explanation. Miriam had every reason to believe
that her visions would remain entirely unfulfilled;
she had good cause to like the school at which she
had passed eight years, in tolerable comfort to
herself, and harmony with her surroundings; and
she had no cause whatever to like home, or to
anticipate that it would be more endurable when
she should have returned thither 'for good,' than
it had been during her dismal holidays.

I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perked up in a glistering grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.
Miriam was not of a sentimental disposition,
but she had strong feelings, and a good deal of
decision of character, a combination which had
made her a favourite at Miss Monitor's school.
She was in earnest in her likes and dislikes; and
being as good-natured as a clever, healthy girl
usually is, especially when she is freely acknow-
ledged to be much prettier than her companions,
her likes were more numerous than her dislikes.
Thus, there was commotion and dismay at Cres-
cent House, Hampstead, when it became known
that Mr Clint had refused to accede to Miriam's
petition for 'one more half,' and that she was
to go home immediately. Miriam became more
emphatically than ever a 'poor darling; and Mr
Clint, her father, who had always been considered
a 'horrid man,' now received public mention as
an old brute.' There was less injustice than

usually attends a sweeping censure in this designa-
tion. Mr Clint was an old brute. Until within
three days of breaking-up time, Miriam had hoped
to gain her father's consent to her remaining at
Crescent House, not because she wished to remain,
and counted on his indulgence for that reason, but
because she honestly believed he must dislike the
prospect of her return as much as she did.
"
'It is impossible I can ever be anything but a
tremendous bore to papa, you know,' she said,
frankly, to Miss Monitor, with whom she was on
confidential terms. Every one bores him, you
know, but Walter and I bore him above and
beyond every one else. I suppose it is just for
appearances' sake he wants me home, and I can't
help hoping he won't be able to resist the tempta-
tion of getting rid of me for six more months.'
Miss Monitor shook her tight little head, and
replied: 'My dear, I should not count on that, if
I were you. If your papa is having you home
against his inclination, or even without it, for
appearances' sake, I can only say it is the first
time I have ever heard of his making such a
sacrifice. No, no, Miriam ; depend upon it, you
will have to go.'
Miss Monitor was right. Suspense in the school-
room, and hope in the breast of Miriam and her
young friends, were put an end to by the arrival
of the post on the following morning. Miriam
opened her father's letter, and the first glance
dissipated her hopes.

given me the trouble of writing two letters instead
of one. Don't do that again. You will come home
as arranged, on the 6th; I have put an advt
for a maid in some mg papers, and directed
applicants to call at Crest House to-morrow between
the hours of 12 and 4. From among them you
will select, with Miss M.'s advice, a suitable person,
to attend upon you, make your clothes, &c. Wages

come here with you on the 6th. You will come by
express, leaving Lond. Bge at 11 A.M.-Yrs truly,
REG. CLINT.
Tears of anger rose in Miriam's eyes. It isn't
only that he refuses my request, but he puts it
aside in such a cold, contemptuous way,' she
muttered; I shall never be able to care for him
in the least, or get on better with him; and I did
mean to try. It's well for Walter he's a man ;
he can do as he likes; he is not obliged to stay at
home, and put up with papa. I don't wonder
at him; I couldn't blame him for anything !'
'Miriam,' said Miss Monitor, entering the room
with her accustomed precision of step and manner,
but with a decided increase of the winter-apple
colouring of her plump cheeks, 'I need not ask
you what news you have. Your father treats me
with scanty courtesy, and I suppose blames me for
your unwillingness to go home. He might recog-
nise that at least you have been happy here.'
'He doesn't care, dear,' said Miriam, flinging
her arms round Miss Monitor's prim little figure
with an energy that caused that lady to rock upon
her tightly shod little feet, and obliged her to
rearrange her collar, her apron, her cuffs, and her
neck-ribbon. He doesn't know anything about my
being happy or unhappy, and as for gratitude!
well, never mind that. I'm grateful, and I always
shall be.'
'I am sure of that,' said Miss Monitor; and then
perhaps remembering that the tone in which they
were discussing Miriam's father was not quite
most appropriate to their mutual relation, she
changed it for one of admonition mingled with
consolation. Miriam listened with ill-disguised
impatience, and then shewed how very little she
understood the principle of that filial obedience
and reverence which Miss Monitor was, with some
inconsistency, endeavouring to instil into her, by
assuring her impetuously that she would do her
very best to put up with' her father for Miss
Monitor's sake.
}
Miss Monitor had some reason to be offended
with Mr Clint. His letter to her contained the
following words: Dr Madam-Be so good as to
acknowledge by return the enclosed cheque for amt of
yr acct, and to send Miss Clint home, according to
my directions.-Yrs truly,
REG. CLINT.'
Miss Monitor was not a high-minded woman, but
neither was she a humbug. She did not 'train
the minds of her pupils,' as the modern style of
prospectus has it, to any transcendental heights of
principle or feeling; she made no professions of
horror at the notion of a lady's boarding-school
being a speculation intended to pay, for she had
intended hers to pay, and it was paying, and no
woman in the world knew better than she did that
no school could be really like home, if home were
all it should be. But she knew equally well, and
practically, that honesty is the best policy; and
she was honest according to her light. She liked
Miriam Clint, but she had no accurate compre-
hension of either her strength or her weaknesses;
and she could hardly have been expected perfectly
to understand how much the girl stood in need
of pity, who would have genuinely preferred to
remain at Crescent House rather than return to
her father's roof. To Miriam, duty translated itself
by 'devoirs,' and pleasure meant going to select
evening parties, and occasionally to the opera,
with one or two other favoured pupils, under the
auspices of Miss Monitor; and taking riding lessons
in the early summer mornings, with her particular
school-friends, on which occasions the riding-
master was accompanied by his pretty young wife.
Nothing could be more proper or more pleasant,
Miriam then thought. She hated leaving all this,
and she hated the thought of the home she was
going to.
The position of affairs seemed to absolve Miss
Monitor and Miriam from any bonds of conven-
tional restraint.
I never was a hypocrite about it, was I, dear?'
said Miriam. 'Don't you remember, long ago,
when we did our compositions for Mr Walker, I
never would write letters about the pleasures of
home and the delights of the country? There is
no pleasure in home to me, and I always did and
always shall hate the country.'
'Don't say that, Miriam,' said Miss Monitor,
with a wise shake of her head. You would like
it very much if you were married to a country
gentleman with a nice property.' Miss Monitor's
own vision of ultimate bliss was retirement to a
cottage, with a cow and a poultry-yard. 'Depend
on it, that would make all the difference. And,
remember, you must have gone home in order for
that to happen. You couldn't have married here.'

'I'm not so sure of that,' said Miriam impetu-
ously; but then, recollecting herself, she added
with some confusion: At least-I mean, something
might have turned up, you know. However, it is
all over now, and there's no good in talking about
it; but of one thing you may be certain, if ever I
marry a country gentleman, he must be well
enough off to take me away from the country-no
rurality for me.'
The dialogue was interrupted by Jane, a trim
parlour-maid, who informed her mistress that a
young person' had called about the maid's place
for Miss Clint. There was an additional shade of
respect in Jane's manner of mentioning Miriam, a
recognition of her added dignity in the prospective
possession of her own maid.
'Take her into the waiting-room, and say I will
see her presently,' said Miss Monitor; and then
added, when Jane withdrew: 'Go and smooth your
hair, Miriam, and make yourself tidy before you
see this person. It would never do for her to see
you looking like that.'
'Oh, what can it matter?' said Miriam rebel-
liously, in the thoroughness of her ill-humour and
discontent. The question is, whether she will
suit me, not whether I shall suit her.'
"There is a little of both in the question, my
dear,' replied Miss Monitor decisively; and it is
always worth every one's while to make a favour-
able impression.'
This was one of those lessons which Miss
Monitor might be fully trusted to administer
conscientiously to her pupils.
Miriam ran up-stairs to her own room, as the
