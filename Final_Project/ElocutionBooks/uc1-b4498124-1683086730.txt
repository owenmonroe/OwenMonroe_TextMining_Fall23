AN HOUR WITH DELSARTE
INTRODUCTORY.
“IT is every one's duty to look as well as possible” is the
feminine plea for a pretty dress, and the masculine
excuse for an overcoat an inch shorter than the one worn
the previous season; and if the dress be but ordered from
a Parisian modiste, and the coat from a London tailor,
they are worn with full confidence that nothing has been
left undone to render the personal appearance all that could
be desired. To be sure, their attention is frequently called
to their faulty walk and imperfect carriage; but criticism
is at once disarmed as they reply, with a toss of the head,
“Oh, I know it, but I can't help it, that's been in our
family for years; my father carried himself that way, and
it's only natural, you see, that I should do the same.” And
the listener is prone to add, “ It's a wonder you don't eat
with your knife, just because your grandfather did.”

An Hour with Delsarte
What man or woman cannot recall from earliest childhood
the maternal reminder, “ Handsome is as handsome does,”
after the anxious inquiry, “How do I look, Mamma?” In
fact, there never was a time when charm of manner was not
considered above personal adornment; but with the advance-
ment of the age has come the demand for something more
than mere unmeaning grace.
To François Delsarte, more than to any other man, is due
the credit of opening our eyes to the possibility of adding
strength and expression to our movements, as well as grace
and ease. His opponents have unwittingly done much to
heighten public interest in his teachings; their scoffing has
only served to whet curiosity and bring the subject of the
æsthetic cultivation of the body into equal prominence with
kindred arts. Hitherto the subject of physical culture has
suggested only the gymnasium, with visions of Indian clubs,
dumb-bells, and various other violent exercises for the de-
velopment of muscle; but, thanks to the genius of Delsarte,
we are in possession of means whereby we may obtain mus-
cular strength, but not at the expense of flexibility, which is
the basis of grace. He has given us a perfect method by
which we may not only obtain freedom and elasticity of
action, but one which adds force and meaning to our every
movement. It frees the body from all restrictions, and ren-
ders it as it should be, — subservient to its master, the will.


## p. 9 (#21) ###############################################

Introductory
It should be the training of every child from its cradle, and
then there would be no bias of birth or custom to overcome
in later years.
The purpose of this little book is to popularize this study .
by freeing it from the technical phraseology usually em-
ployed in treating the subject, and while endeavoring to
interest the trained intellect, to present it in a manner
comprehensible to the average mind. A suggestion to the
intelligent is enough to convey the idea; but unless the
mind possesses the attributes of taste and judgment, a living
teacher is necessary to the execution of the plan.
Except in rare instances, printed directions for practice
are found to be valueless, because of their constant mis-
interpretation. Equally disastrous are the consequences of
taking pattern or modelling after an incompetent instructor;
and unless the pupil is able to discriminate between the
genuine and the counterfeit article, he is almost certain to
suffer from the effects of incorrect training. The best test
of the student's permanent and practical gain is the readi- :
ness with which he clothes the idea in his own language, his
ability to recognize it in whatever form it may be presented,
and practically to apply it.
This, experience has shown, is the only conclusive evi- .
dence of progress, and that this progress may be the more .
rapid, the memory should not at first be taxed with a

burden of scientific facts; merely the fundamental princi-
ples at the base of the art should be learned and their
application understood. The pupil's attention should be
directed to the study of himself as the first step to a
knowledge of others, and an assistance to him in observ-
ing nature and studying art. In this way he learns to
analyze the movements of his body and intelligently to
interpret and classify them.
If in the succeeding chapters we have presented the ideas
which Delsarte has evolved, in words which all may under-
stand, and from which the reader may form a practical
acquaintance with the subject, the object of our work will
have been accomplished. And if in this endeavor it should
be objected by some that we have been over-explicit at
times, we can only say, in justification of our course, that
we would rather be criticised on this score than to be
misunderstood.

Importance of Correct Bearing
II.
IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT BEARING.
AS it ever occurred to us that we are constantly creat-
ing impressions by our unconscious expressions, and
in consequence are possibly being judged sickly, weak,
conceited, vain, or vulgar? People form their estimates of
our character, not necessarily through our language, for
perhaps they have never heard us speak, nor through the
expression of our faces alone, but through the bearing of
our entire bodies.
Which of us has not accurately determined traits of char-
acter in persons with whom we have never exchanged a
word, merely from the poise or carriage of their bodies ?
This is not to be wondered at when we consider that the
body is but the outward symbol and development of the
real or inner self.
Then, it may be asked, “ How shall we hope to escape the
truths of character if Nature thus inevitably stamps our
minds upon our forms?” And the answer is, “ Bring the
outward manifestation of the impression you wish to create
daily and hourly into the consciousness, and it will soon

become second nature, and will take the place of the unat-
tractive and consequently undesirable appearance.” “Must
we all sit alike?” I hear a bright little girl ask the ques-
tion. No, not unless you wish to imitate a row of lay
figures; there is no fixed mode by which we must all either
sit, stand, or walk alike.
An attitude which would be natural and becoming to one
of us might appear constrained and awkward in another;
but there are certain forms of action common to us all,
which we take as the standard by which we measure faults
and excellences.
Most of us have habits acquired or inherited which, meas-
ured by this standard, are not correct. A judicious teacher,
instead of obliging all his pupils to obey a fixed rule of
expression, will consider and provide for their individual
requirements just as the competent physician prescribes for
the various ailments of his respective patients. Quinine
is no doubt a valuable medicine; but were a doctor to ad-
minister it to all of his patients it would be no more
absurd than the manner in which the art of expression has
frequently been treated.
An easy and correct bearing is the first essential, — the
one which was intended for you by Nature, before you were
deformed by habit or custom. As no two of us are con-
structed exactly alike in any particular, either of mind,

temperament, or physique, it must follow that our faults
and excellences will partake of this dissimilarity.
One of the most deplorable faults of bearing is produced
by giving an undue prominence to the abdomen, and is
emphasized by carrying the hands directly over it (see
Fig. 1). Observation need not be confined to the lower
classes for this glaring fault; one would have no difficulty
in finding it in the higher grades of society, where it is
unpardonable.
An attitude which mars the appearance and damages the
health is where the chest is habitually passive, finally becom-
ing hollow (see Fig. 2). This attitude, while often induced
by a delicate constitution and weak lungs, is no doubt fre-
quently the cause of debilitated breathing; it suggests ill-
health, timidity, and helplessness. Children having this
habit are vaguely directed to “ Straighten up; ” nine times
out of ten they mechanically raise the shoulders, thereby
shortening the neck and giving a deformed appearance to
the upper part of the body (see Fig. 3).
Two forms of bearing which one frequently observes, and
which are certainly not attractive, are the habitual attitudes
of arrogance and self-conceit: the first is produced by throw-
ing the weight on the back leg and carrying the shoulders
upward and backward (see Fig. 4); the second by a con-
spicuous presentation of the chest, which asks without words,


## p. 12 (#28) ##############################################

14
An Hour with Delsarte
“ Do you know who I am ?” (see Fig. 5). It is desirable
that we should cultivate an attractive habit of bearing, that
the impressions we create may be agreeable ones: substi-
tute the correct bearing clearly and regularly in place of the
false one, which will thus disappear “ere we are aware."
It is an art to assert one's self, make one's presence felt,
without seeming officious; and the few who succeed inevi-
tably become conspicuous ornaments of society. The first !!
step toward obtaining this desirable result is to cultivate
an appearance of bodily repose. Do not confound bodily
repose with mental sluggishness. One is not necessarily
stupid because his arms and head are not flying in all
directions.
A natural poise is shown when one stands with one foot
slightly in advance of the other, the weight resting easily on
the balls of the feet (see Fig. 6). When activity begins the
attitude changes; as you speak there is a transition of the
weight of the body to the advanced foot.
If the body is properly poised, the arms will naturally take
care of themselves, and will fall easily in front of the hips.
There is no mistake a teacher could be guilty of which would
be more inexcusable than that of giving directions for the
use of the hands and arms without first correcting all imper-
fections of carriage or bearing.

Plea for Flexibility

III.
PLEA FOR FLEXIBILITY.
J OW beautifully you perform!” said I one day to a
pianist; and she replied, “ Yes, but my performing,
beautiful as it appears, represents many years of patient
practice under skilful masters; I have given five hours a
day for several years to preliminary practice alone.” If this
be true of an art, the exercise of which requires trained
fingers merely, with how much more force does it apply
to one in which the entire body is concerned !
The lack of training in art is most apparent when there
is the greatest absence of flexibility, which is the basis
of freedom, and is essential to grace in expression. We
have seen the enormities of physical bearing which vices of
habit and custom have entailed upon us, and the necessity i
we are under of removing them before we are able to con-
form to a standard of natural grace.
In other words, we must free the body from the stiffness !, -
of individuality by yielding it up to the claims of univer-
sality. We must break down error before we can build
up truth. This object is attained in physical training by

surrendering the body to the discipline of an æsthetical
gymnastic drilling.
Delsarte's inventive genius has furnished us a series of
mechanical exercises which subject all the joints and muscles
to a flexing or freeing process, which is the first step
toward restoring them to the pliancy of unconscious free-
dom. They destroy that unbending muscular rigidity largely
imposed by conventionality, and infuse an air of elastic in-
dependence, — so fundamental an element in a graceful car-
riage. They correct all faults of negligent personal habit,
and overcome hereditary tendencies which sometimes, if
unchecked, result in grave consequences to health. These
are among the purposes of Delsarte's scheme of mechanical
movements.
As every part of the body is concerned in expression,
it should be uniformly cultivated throughout. The custom,
therefore, among vocalists of training the voice to the neg-
lect of the other agents of expression is no less absurd than
were the preparations of the immature dramatic student, who
took a course of reading lessons, a pair of top-boots, and a
sword, and went upon the stage.
Public entertainers, like pianists and concert singers, whose
professions do not call into active practice more than one set
of muscles, are very apt to overlook their shortcomings in
the matter of personal bearing, until unpleasantly reminded

of their reality by a painful sense of consciousness when the
moment for appearing arrives. Thus the effect of many
an otherwise artistic effort has been sadly marred and some-
times utterly ruined through lack of that complacent ease
born of confidence in a becoming manner.
A general cultivation of the entire body should form the
preliminary training or groundwork upon which to build up
a special education for any art, and the resulting Alexibility
and control of all the muscles is of the greatest assistance
in subjugating the set of muscles expressly exercised in a
particular pursuit.
As the judicious use of these exercises is productive of
immeasurable good, so on the other hand is their improper
practice harmful in the extreme. Unskilful exponents of
Delsarte, mistaking the purpose of these mechanical move-
ments, have done much to bring his labors into disrepute.
Their pupils usually make ridiculous exhibitions of them-
selves by the agonizing sinuosities which they throw into
their gestures, and the airy nothingness which pervades all
their movements. Good taste would promptly reject such
antics as a silly travesty of nature. But the cause of Delsarte
has suffered so much from this misapprehension, that the
mention of his name recalls to many people only the specta-
cle of a group of expressionless girls languidly waving their
arms in the air.

An Hour with Delsarte
A young lady, applying to me one day for instruction,
assured me that her father was “just disgusted with those
weak Delsarte movements; he wants me to take up some-
thing with some strength to it.” Here Delsarte was con-
demned on account of the limited vision of his interpreter.
The end of art is to conceal art, and the study of Delsarte
is a means to this end. It seeks to provide a plan of self-
cultivation in harmony with the lines of natural impulse; to
assist, not to improve upon, nature is its aim.
The eminent actor and elocutionist, Mr. James E. Mur-
doch, in his admirable work, “A Plea for Spoken Lan-
guage,” ably bears out this idea; he says: -
“We would have true, natural expression idealized into its high-
est possibilities of beauty, grace, and power ; to illustrate : All the
strong passions of the mind communicate themselves, as we have
seen, so suddenly and irresistibly to the body that vehement ges-
ticulations and impassioned tones are the result. These tones and
gesticulations are, no doubt, natural, but they are not always the
most perfect or graceful expressions of nature. . . . Nature may
readily run into deformity; and it must be the purpose of art and
cultivation to conceal or remove all deformities, for art is called in,
not to pervert, but to refine and exalt nature.
Nature, it is true, will accomplish much without art in all human
operations, and art will be of no avail without nature ; but it is only
by a combination of the two that we can produce perfection in
anything that is the workmanship of man.”

IV.
FRANÇOIS DELSARTE.
W E have already stated that Delsarte has done more
" than any other man to create a general interest in
the subject of the æsthetic cultivation of the body as a
means of expression; and before proceeding farther with an
account of his discoveries and inventions, we desire to record
a few of the many interesting episodes with which the life
of this illustrious artist was crowded. He was born No-
vember 11, 1811, at Solesme, France, and died in Paris
July 20, 1871. Like most men of genius, his boyhood years
were full of privation and suffering. His father, who was
a physician, possessed a very proud and imperious nature,
which was greatly irritated by his extreme poverty; in con-
sequence of which he treated Delsarte's mother, who was
a woman of rare abilities, with such injustice and cruelty
that she was finally compelled to abandon him and fee with
her two sons to Paris, where she died before she could make
her talents available. François's little brother soon followed
his mother, dying of starvation and cold in his brother's
SO
arms.

An Hour with Delsarte
Thus we find Delsarte in 1821, a little boy of ten years,
in the utmost destitution and entirely alone in the world.
One night he was found in the street by a rag-picker, who
took pity on him and carried him to his miserable home.
During the next two years, while in this man's employ,
he developed his grand passion for music, and invented
a system of musical notation, in order to preserve the
airs which delighted him when listening to the bands of
music and itinerant singers which he encountered in the
streets.
At thirteen years of age Delsarte was discovered in the
garden of the Tuileries by Bambini, an eminent professor
of music, who found him writing figures in the sand. When
questioned as to the significance of the marks, he replied
that he was writing down the music which was being played
in the garden. Amazed, Bambini inquired who had taught
him the process; he replied, “Nobody, sir; I found it out
myself.”
“ Thus in the dust of Paris were first written the elements
of a system destined to regenerate art.” Bambini took the
boy home, and instructed him until the pupil became greater
than the master. At fourteen Delsarte's talents secured him
admission to the Conservatory, where, by observation of Na-
ture and a careful study of cause and effect, he soon de-
veloped a style of his own which was radically different from

those of his teachers, at whose hands he received nothing but
discouragement.
Delsarte was led to follow the promptings of his own
genius through the praises of Malibran and Adolphe Nourrit,
who predicted that he would be a great artist. His indomi-
table will and perseverance at last secured him an interview
with the director of the Opéra Comique, who, upon seeing
Delsarte's ragged clothes, declined even to give hin the
office of call-boy, the only position then vacant, to which
Delsarte replied, “Monsieur, if my clothes are poor, my
art is genuine; I am prepared to fill the position of premier
sujet among your singers.” The manager finally consented
to hear him sing, which resulted in his offering Delsarte an
engagement for a year at a salary of ten thousand francs.
The failure of his voice compelled him to retire from the
lyric stage in 1834, four years from the time of having
made his first appearance before an audience, which was
electrified
Delsarte possessed great courtliness of manner, in which
there was nothing of self-assertion; his form was massive,
and his eye brilliant; and when he sang, his exquisite voice,
“ aided in effect by those imperial gestures of which he
had already discovered the secret,” found its way to every
heart.
Upon his retirement from the stage Delsarte decided to

An Hour with Delsarte
devote himself to perfecting a system which should give a
solid foundation to the art of expression, and one which
should recognize the limitations, no less than the possibili-
ties, of the individual. He obtained a perfect knowledge
of the uses and capabilities of the muscles through a con-
scientious study of anatomy and physiology, and he spared
no pains or labor to perfect the system which was his special
life work, and on which his fame rests.
Delsarte's natural modesty kept him withdrawn from the
glare of publicity, and during life he was little known outside
of his immediate circle, in which were included men and
women of rank and fortune, and members of the reigning
families of Europe, who sought his instruction as a means
of rendering them personally more attractive for the position
which they occupied in social life. The names of Rachel,
Sontag, Macready, Madeleine Brohan, and Pasca are among
Delsarte's professional pupils; while equally distinguished
names, including that of Père Hyacinthe, are among the
number to whom he gave instruction in pulpit oratory.
Born in poverty, early deprived of home influences and
maternal love, Delsarte's genius carried him, after nine years
of unremitting labor, to a brief career before an admiring
public, to which, after his retirement, owing to a firm relig-
ious conviction, he would never return. He died at the age
of sixty years, comparatively unknown, even in his own city.

Delsarte's friends have patiently borne the ridicule which
has been heaped upon him, knowing and believing that his
greatness will shine brighter and brighter in future years
because the principles which he evolved are founded upon
truth, and “ Truth will abide.”
Inquiries regarding Delsarte and his wonderful system are
by no means confined to those directly interested in the
subject; one hears the question asked everywhere, — on the
street, in the parlor, and in public places. It has been so
variously and incorrectly answered that people have formed
very ludicrous notions on the subject; some foolishly be-
lieving that the “Delsarte System” was intended to teach
us to sit, walk, and move about after a new fashion, and
other notions, too absurd to have been dreamt of in Del-
sarte's philosophy, or in any other.
Now, then, laying aside all those follies and divesting the
subject of its technical dress, Delsartism, in brief, is a phase
of nature idealized, that is, freed from those features which
would tend to direct the mind from a contemplation of its
beauties, the preservation of which is primarily the object
of all art. Delsarte's death in the year 1871 prevented, it
is said, a visit which he intended making to this country for
the purpose of introducing the subject of his studies here.
It is greatly to be deplored that this visit was never made,
as it might have been the occasion of his leaving some

indisputable record of his works; but it is a lamentable fact
that he died without having committed to durable form
any complete account of his extraordinary labors in behalf
of æsthetic science.
In view of this fact we are greatly indebted to such of
Delsarte's pupils as were in possession of his manuscripts,
and to others who have made careful research into the
subject, for having made a conscientious endeavor to give
us a correct arrangement of Delsarte's system of expression
as formulated by himself.
Without wishing to criticise these various published
accounts, to our mind many of Delsarte's formulas, as
presented, seem impracticable, because of the scientific ter-
minology in which they are framed, and deal, beside, with
details too minute, and touch considerations too remote,
to be successfully applied to study or exemplified in
practice, however important they may be to the theorist,
the sage, or the scientist.

PHILOSOPHY OF DELSARTE'S SYSTEM.
IT was Delsarte's great discovery that the human soul,
in its covering of flesh called the body, moves in
obedience to universal law; that its efforts to manifest it-
self to the outer world are restricted to the conditions
imposed by space, time, and motion, — the three great ele-
ments by which its activities are inevitably environed; that
the soul must express itself in space, through time, by mo-
tion, — in other words, every agent of expression must
appear in space by means of motion, and requires time
in which to manifest itself; and finally, that the force by
which this motion is produced is supplied by the soul, or
psychic principle, and is of three different kinds, each cor-
responding to the three states of the being which it trans-
lates in expression.
Thus, when this force causes motion outward, or from
the body, it is said to proceed from our physical nature,
and is called Vital; when this force causes motion inward,
or toward the body, it is said to proceed from our intel-
lectual nature, and is called Mental; and when this force is


## p. 26 (#50) ##############################################

26
An Hour with Delsarte
poised, -- that is, when it neither causes motion from nor
toward the body, but tends to hold the body in poise, — it
is said to proceed from the emotional nature, and is called
Emotive.
In every human being one of these three natures, or
states of the being, as they are called, is predominant, while
the other two are tributary or subordinate; and the degree
of this predominance of the one state, and the order of
importance of the other two, are the root and source of all
the various types and traits in mankind.
For example, a man of intellectual habit, or one in whom
the mental is predominant, will reveal his nature through
subjective motion, or motion which is mainly toward the
body. On the contrary, in a man in whom the vital nature
leads, the motion will be chiefly objective, or from the
body; and if the emotional nature rules, the motion will
be neither directly subjective nor objective, but may par-
take of either, according to the extent to which the emo-
tional nature is invaded by the mental or the vital.
Again, every act of life has its rise in one of these three
states of the being, and traces its motion and motive
to one of them. This predominant state is said to lead,
while the other two assist or follow the former, and the
resulting action corresponds to the state from whence it
proceeds.

Thus we find the seat of sensation in the physical na-
ture, which is also the source of vitality, and reveals itself
through outward or objective motion. The seat of sen-
timent is in the emotive nature, which is the source of
the highest emotions of the soul; it reveals itself through
centred or poised motion.
The seat of consciousness is in the mental nature, which
is the source of thought, and is revealed through subjective
or inward motion. It should be borne in mind here that
this division of the soul into separate states is purely an
arbitrary distinction, and is made for the purpose of facili-
tating analytical study. It is a matter of convenience
merely, and has no existence in fact.
The testimony of the eminent psychologist, Thomas
Carlyle, is adduced in support of this position: —
“We talk of faculties as if they were distinct things, separable ;
as if a man had intellect, imagination, fancy, etc., as he has hands,
feet, and arms. Then again we hear of a man's “intellectual na-
ture' and of his “moral nature' as if these again were divisible, and
existed apart. Necessities of language do prescribe such forms of
utterance, but words ought not to harden into things for us. We
ought to know withal, and to keep forever in mind, that these
divisions are at bottom but names; that man's spiritual nature,
the vital force that dwells within him, is essentially one and
indivisible.
“All that a man does is physiognomical of him; you may see

how a man would fight by the way in which he sings; his courage,
or want of courage, is visible in the word he utters, in the opinion
he has formed, no less than in the stroke he strikes. He is one
and preaches the same self abroad in all these ways."
Now, in the same way that the soul is divided, and for
the same purpose of study, the body is arbitrarily separated
into three grand divisions, each division corresponding to
one of the three states of the being which it represents,
and which it selects as its favorite ground for display.
Thus, the head represents the favorite ground for the ex-
pression of the mental nature; the legs and arms the ground
for the vital nature; and the trunk, or torso, the ground
for the emotive nature. Each of these grounds, or divisions
of the body, is subdivided, and again we have the three states
of the being represented in these subdivisions.
In the domain of the head the eyes and forehead are
mental, the nose and cheeks are emotional, and the mouth
and lips are vital. In the trunk the upper torso is mental;
the heart region, or middle torso, is emotional; and the
abdomen is vital. For the legs and arms, the feet and
hands are mental, the fore-arms and lower legs are emotive,
and the upper arms and upper legs are vital.
Still further subdivisions are made in the face, hands,
and other portions of the body; but these minute distinc-
tions have a rather doubtful utility, and are more valu-

able to illustrate the logic of the science than to serve
a practical purpose for general study.
The application of this threefold principle, which is
the basis of Delsarte's philosophy, is considered under
appropriate headings in the subsequent chapters.1
1 It has been the object in these chapters to discuss the study of expression
from its most practical and least theoretical side. To those, however, who
desire to enter into a more philosophical investigation of the question, with
a view to grasping the relations of the physical to the metaphysical man,
“ The Synthetic Philosophy of Expression,” by Moses True Brown), is heartily
recommended as being the most comprehensive, logical, and exhaustive con-
sideration of the subject in present use.

PRACTICAL LESSON ON EXPRESSION.
In the first chapter we insisted that the only way to be
certain the pupil comprehends the subject, and that the
result desired has been obtained, is to demand from him the
idea in his own words. To farther illustrate our plan, we
will undertake to conduct a practical lesson on the subject
of “ Expression ” before an average class of pupils.
“Good morning, young ladies and gentlemen. In our
previous lessons I have done most of the talking, in order
to give you a general idea of the requirements of the study.
That I may discover how much thinking you have done, I
shall now reverse matters, and you must give me the infor-
mation. We will begin by asking Miss Mary to tell us what
we are here to study.”
Mary's face radiates sunshine as she readily attempts to
reply. She hesitates, however, and then, on taking second
thought, the sunshine disappears behind a cloud.
“Why, it's to study – oh, it's to study — oh, it's — why,
it's to --- oh, I know, but I can't just tell."
“Ah, but you have heard it said that if you can't tell, you
don't know.”


## p. 31 (#57) ##############################################

Practical Lesson on Expression 31
“Well, then,” returns Miss Mary, courageously resuming
the attack, “it's to study elocution.”
“Then you think we are here merely to learn how to
read?”
"Oh, I know that is n't right,” admits the young lady,
" but I can't exactly express it.”
“Miss G., perhaps you can assist us in finding out what
we are here to study?”.
Miss G. proceeds with more caution : “Well, I think it is
to learn the art of acting."
“Very true, but that is not all, besides, we are not all
studying for the stage. Tell me in one word what we are
here to study."
“ Delsarte!” triumphantly shouts little Miss it.
“ Miss A. says 'Delsarte,' but she forgets that Delsarte
is a means, not an end. Now, then, to what end are we
studying?”
" It's to learn dramatic expression,” ventures thoughtful
Miss L.
“Very true, indeed; ” and all the others regard Miss L.
with little glances of envy. “But why say 'dramatic expres-
sion'?” The glances of envy are withdrawn. “Tell me in
one word the end and object of our studies.”
“ Expression,” choruses the class.
“Right! We are here to master the art of expression.

Now, then, let us emblazon that word in large letters here on
the blackboard, so that it will stand out conspicuously from
all other words, and so that we may keep it constantly before
our minds, – that the great end and object of our studies is
expression; not dramatic expression, not facial expression,
but expression only, — expression, pure and simple. Now,
then, I want someone to tell me what we understand by
expression. Miss S., what do you understand by the term
* expression'?”
Miss S. looks as if she occupied a position of extreme
peril, and fears to hazard a reply. The others show a fellow-
sympathy for her distress. Presently she falters, “ Ahem!
it's — er -- ah — it's — er, well, I'm sure I don't know, — if
it is n't the expression of our faces.”
" Is expression confined then to our faces? Give me a
comprehensive reply in your own choice of language that
will answer the question, "What is expression?' You tell
us, Miss K.”
"Why, expression,” urges Miss K., desperately, “shows
how we feel, how we act, how we look.”
" But you are a little mixed; our feelings are a subject
of expression, and our looks and actions are modes of
expression. I want you to reply to me as to a stranger
who seeks enlightenment on the subject. Mr. R., what do
you say expression is ?”


## p. 33 (#59) ##############################################

“Well,” observes Mr. R., learnedly, “I think expression is
the sum of all our actions."
“A very ingenious, but scarcely an instructive, reply.
There is doubtless a great deal expressed in the sum total
of our actions, but that does not help us to understand
what the term 'expression’ signifies in the sense we are
using it."
" It means actions,” exclaims some one, thinking to profit
by the brevity of the first definition ; “ Feeling," says
another, seizing on the same mental thread; “The expres-
sion of emotion,” says a third; and then some one calls
out, as if by inspiration, “It is a sign of the state of the v
mind."
“Ah, there we have it. “A sign of the state of the
mind,' with a slight alteration, and we are out of the diffi-
culty." And at this, each one feverishly begins to formu-
late a reply based on this idea.
“ The outward expression of the mind,” suggests one;
“ The sign of thought,” submits another; “ The manifesta-
tion of life,” essays a third; and a fourth, “The outward
sign of human nature.”
“Very good, indeed; each of your answers embodies the
idea. Now, out of these various definitions let us form one
that will exactly state the meaning in the fewest, simplest
words; and remember that words mcan just what we under-

stand by them and nothing more. Let us say then that
expression is a sign of the being; and while I am writing
the words on the blackboard opposite the word 'expres-
sion, please turn them over in your minds so that we may
agree exactly as to our understanding of them. Now, then,
we will proceed one step farther, and I will ask you what
meaning you attach to the word “being.' Mr. A., what
do you understand by the word?”
Having now become warmed to the subject, the timid
have put by their reserve, and the doubtful have grown bold;
so Mr. A. promptly answers, “I think being' means the
soul.” “No, the mind,” corrects another, in his ardor for-
getting his courtesy. “Life,” “ Vitality,” “Existence,” sug-
gest various others in the same breath.
“ Again, you are each of you right; but again, for the
purpose of agreeing in our understanding, let us unite on a
common definition that will convey to each of us the same
meaning. Remembering now what we said about words,
that they mean just what we understand by them, let us
take Webster's definition of the word “being :' 'Being is
that which exists in any way, whether it be material or
spiritual. Now, then, we have said that expression is a
sign of the being. I will ask you, Mr. B., to exem-
plify or apply that definition in your own person by some
action."

Mr. B. reflects an instant, during an impressive silence,
and then admits that he is unable to do so, at the same time
shifting in his seat and crossing his legs with embarrassment
in his manner.
“Why did you shift so in your seat and cross your legs
when you replied?”.
“Well,” he continues, more confused than ever, “I scarcely
know; I suppose it's because I was a little nervous.”
“ Exactly, because you were a little nervous; you are
not in the habit, I see, of analyzing these signs of your be-
ing; you answered my question unconsciously. The cross-
ing of your legs and the shifting about in your chair plainly
revealed or expressed the state of your feelings, and was
therefore a sign of your being. Now tell me what you un-
derstand by expression, Mr. B.”
Promptly comes the reply: “Expression shows the condi-
tion or state of the feelings."
“ Precisely. And the feelings are a part of what, Miss V.?”
She hesitates.
“ Can any one tell?”
“The being,” comes from several.
“ And the mind is a part of what?”
“ The soul, — no, no, the being."
“ And the soul?”
“ The being.”

“ Is there any attribute of man, mental, emotive, or vital,
material or spiritual, that is not a part of the being?”
- None.”
“ If I prick you with a pin and you cry out, what does
that mean, Miss V.?”
“ It means that I am hurt.”
" True, but does your cry express anything?"
“ It expresses pain.”
“ And the act of crying is the sign of what?”
“A sign of the being."

"If I were suddenly to bring you intelligence of some

" It would express grief or sorrow.”

“ The being.”
“ If I prick the skin of a dead person, there would be
no response. Why, Miss F.?”

" Because the person is dead.”
" Why is the person dead?”
An awkward pause; then, after a moment of profound de-
liberation, “ Because the spirit has Aed.”
" And the spirit is what?”
“ The being.”
“ But we said a moment since that the body was a part
of the being; in the dead person we have the body still,
yet you say the being is gone."
“Oh, yes, I know now; the spirit is a part of the being."
“ Exactly; then the body is essential to the being as well
as the soul?”
" Yes."
“ And if I prick the skin of a dead person, why will he
make no sign; that is, express nothing?”.
“ Because the body without the soul is not a being.”

us write this on the blackboard, following the last definition,

VITAL DIVISION.
IT will be remembered that Delsarte divided the body
into three grand divisions, to correspond with the
vital, mental, and emotive states of our being, because
each seemed to select one of these as its principal agent
of expression as if by preference; and that he also subdi-
vided these grand divisions into tracts or zones from which
and to which the hand and arm in gesture seemed to move
naturally.
In the grand divisions he selected the limbs as the prin-
cipal agents of the vital nature, because they disclose the
greatest power of action and physical strength. They are
the levers which sustain motion, and among the more ani-
mal races, the lower the grade of intelligence, the higher
the degree of muscular development attained in the ex-
ercise of these members. They are simply the manifes-
tation of vital life. As man becomes civilized and refined
there is a greater freedom in the movements of the arms
and legs, showing a blending of the mental and emotional
natures with the vital; and they perform a varied service


## p. 39 (#67) ##############################################

Vital Division
39
in connection with the head and torso in the function of
expression.
In the divisions of the leg, Delsarte designates the
upper leg, or thigh, as vital because the impelling force
which gives impulse to the leg in walking is first felt
here. His reason for ascribing to the lower leg the office
of revealing the emotional nature is admirably shown in
the act of kneeling, when we would express a subordina-
tion of self to the will of others in supplication, entreaty,
appeal, reverence, and obedience.
No argument is required to prove even to the satisfac-
tion of the most sceptical that the foot is the direct agent
of the mental nature. How often we detect a person's
nervous mental state through the unconscious tapping of
the foot upon the floor! Our intention to advance or re-
treat is gestured by the feet. We will endeavor to show
that the ruling condition or sentiment of the individual is
indicated in the position of the feet, as evinced in the
following illustrations drawn from familiar attitudes.
If the feet are separated, one slightly in advance of the
other, the weight resting on the balls of the feet, it indi-
cates repose or poise of the being. Emotive nature pre-
dominates (see Fig. 6).
If there is a transition of the weight to the front of the
foot, the motion being outward or from the centre, we con-

40
An Hour with Delsarto
clude that it is impelled from the vital nature; if. on the
other hand, the transition of the weight is toward the back
of the foot, inward or toward the centre, it shows that the
mental nature directs the action. If the weight of the
body rests mainly upon the back leg, and the knee of
the advanced leg is bent, it indicates reserved force,
thought, reflection. It shows that the mind of the indi-
vidual rules; that he is a thinker. Mental nature pre-
dominates.
If the feet are slightly separated and pointing directly
forward, it indicates rusticity, or a feeble condition, as a
child learning to walk. Vital nature predominates.
If the attitude is not natural, but has been assumed, it
indicates that the inferior stands before the superior in
the person of the valet, or the soldier. Emotive nature
active.
If the legs are wide apart, we are led to infer that the.
person is either in a state of fatigue or intoxication, or that
he is familiarly vulgar. The attitude denotes also brag-
ging, pomposity, and bluster; vital nature predominating.
If the condition is that of prostration, the weight will
be upon the back leg, the knee bent, the forward leg free;
vital nature prominent.
When the weight of the body rests entirely upon the
back foot, and both legs are straight, it shows a state of

antagonism, defiance, or daring; vital nature predomina-
ting (see Fig. 4).
If the feet are separated and the weight is borne equally
on both, the posture indicates indecision, doubt, or delib-
eration : “Shall I go or stay, advance or retreat?” Mental
nature predominating.
If the forward knee is bent, it shows attention or in-
tention, and reveals a vehement or passionate tendency;
either vital or emotive nature predominating.
When the weight rests upon one foot and the knee is
straight, the other leg free and the foot resting on its side,
the attitude indicates a listening state or one of eager sus-
pense; equal predominance of the mental and emotive.
When a person is in a state of exaltation, the weight
will rest upon the advanced foot, the back leg entirely
free and the knee straight; the degree of feeling will de-
termine whether the back foot rests fully upon the ground
or is raised; in this, emotive nature predominates.
These attitudes of the feet and legs, revealing the men-
tal, vital, and emotional conditions, should be carefully
considered, as well as the innumerable variations arising
from the diversity of sentiments and emotions. They should
be analyzed and practically applied as necessity or occasion
may require.
The arm, like the leg, reveals the activity of the vital

nature, and, as an agent of expression, has three centres
of motion: that of the shoulder, which as a subdivision
Delsarte designates as vital because the force from the
brain seems to Aow into the upper arm first, thus moving
all other parts from this centre. While the action of the
shoulders is vital in significance, they are also moved by
our higher emotions; in consequence Delsarte called the
shoulder a thermometer or indicator of sensibility or pas-
sion, leaving the face to determine whether the action
springs from love or hate.
The emotive nature is revealed through the second
centre at the elbow. When in repose it indicates ease,
modesty, and self-possession. When turned outward from
the body it indicates conceit, tenderness, self-assertion;
when turned inward toward the body it indicates weakness,
humility, subordination of self. The third centre in the
arm reveals the mental nature through the motion of the
wrist, which is the direct agent of the hand; it directs
the hand, presents it, and therefore requires great cultiva-
tion in order to render it supple, free, and strong.
The attitudes of the arms, like those of the legs, reveal
the ruling state in the being or individual.
There is no part of the human body, unless we except
the face, more significant in its actions than that of the
hand; for while “the eye may be trained to deceive, the

features may be schooled to assume a stolid indifference
under circumstances of mental emotion, the impulsive
pressure or involuntary movement of the hand frequently
betrays the truth. The motions of the hand add force to
argument, and often speak a silent language of their own,
portraying fear, astonishment, or grief beyond the power
of words to convey."
To the hand are assigned various offices which it is
impossible for the face to express. “It can handle the
object, sketch it, and project it in form into space.” We
draw, paint, play, work, and write with the hand; we de-
fine, indicate, affirm, deny, mould, detect, conceal, reveal,
surrender, hold, accept, reject, inquire, acquire, support,
assail, caress, and protect. All the knowledge of the deaf
and dumb is acquired through a language which is revealed
by the hand.
Each of the three states of being is disclosed through
the hand; it lends itself to whichever state predominates
in activity, and, like the leg and arm, indicates the con-
dition of the being. For instance, if the fingers are folded
in the palm with the thumb upright at the side of the first
finger, it indicates a condition of self-possession and power;
if, instead of resting at the side, the thumb is pressed
tightly across the second joints of the closed fingers, reso-
lution or struggle is indicated.

If the fingers and thumb are crooked at the first joint,
toward centre of palm, it indicates a condition of exas-
peration; if the hand is nearly closed it is that of convul-
sion. Animated attention is shown by the open hand,
fingers straight, thumb slightly spread. If the hand is
prone it signifies earnestness; if the fingers are energized
it indicates passion and vehemence. Trust and tender-
ness are revealed through the open palm with the ends.

VIII.
MENTAL DIVISION.
IN the grand divisions of the body the head is the special
agent of the mental nature; it contains the brain, the
organ of the mind, the development of which is shown
in the formation of the cranium and face, which, taken
in connection with manner, are a faithful reflex of the
mind. Says Addison, “Every passion gives a particular
cast to the countenance, and is apt to discover itself in
some feature or other. I have seen an eye curse for
half an hour together, and an eyebrow call a man
scoundrel.”
A full, high forehead, with well-proportioned features,
contrasted with a low, receding brow and projecting cheek-
bones, outwardly mark the extremes between intellectual
superiority and mental density.
The highest and lowest grades of intelligence in man-
kind closely approximate in appearance these external
distinctions of feature; and as we said of the limbs in
the chapter on the vital division of the body, that they
attain the greatest perfection of physical strength among

the inferior races of men, so in the highly sensitive organ-
isms of the more advanced races, as the quality of the
material becomes finer and the quantity is lessened, there
is a gradual development toward the perfection of flex-
ible strength.
Muscular Alexibility is found in its greatest perfection
among intellectual people; and as the intellectual fibre be-
comes coarse in quality, so the muscles lose their delicacy,
and as the muscles gain in mere physical force, they lose
in temperamental or flexible strength.
As in the subdivisions of the limbs the invasions of the
vital nature by the mental and emotive are shown, so,
too, the invasions of the mental nature by the emotive
and vital natures are illustrated by the subdivisions of the
head into three zones or tracts, each corresponding to
a qualified or complex state of one of the great principles
of the being. Thus the region of the head about the
mouth and jaws is selected to express a phase of the vital
nature, the region of the cheeks and nose answering to
a similar purpose for the emotive nature; while the eyes
and forehead are the mental centre of the mental division,
and therefore the most expressive agency of the mental
nature in the body.
The mind is revealed most directly through the eye,
which translates with marvellous fidelity the nicest shades

of thought and feeling. An active or a sluggish mental
habit is revealed through the eye by the brightness or
dulness of that organ.
A brow corrugated with seams and wrinkles is the ex-
ternal evidence of a life of thought or much care, just
as the brow innocent of a line, over blank, staring eyes,
betokens a vacuous mind.
The emotional nature is expressed in the face through
the blush and pallor of the cheeks, and in the nose
through the dilation and contraction of the nostrils in the
various forms of excitability and sensibility. The nostrils
dilate in anger, passionate resentment, and the like, while
contempt and cruelty contract them.
Like the eyes and forehead, the construction or shape
of the nose and cheeks is partly indicative of the character
of the individual; thus, a nose cast in an heroic or grace-
ful mould is rarely found disassociated with some admi-
rable qualities of mind or heart, and a pinched, peaked,
or Alat nose nearly always accompanies a mean, peevish,
or crafty nature.
So, too, the blending of the vital nature with the men-
tal, as shown in the shape of the mouth, jaws, and upper
neck, has its share in determining character. Heavy, sen-
suous lips, square, massive jaws, and a thick neck leave
little for conjecture as to the prevailing traits of the per-

son possessing them. From this to the thin, compressed
lips, bony jaws, and pointed chin of hardness and cruelty,
there is every grade of natural impulse, from the most
vicious to the most virtuous.
The mouth is the seat of the organs of voice and taste,
both of which are vital in expression; but it is also con-
cerned in the production of articulate speech, — a direct
agent of the mental nature. The lips readily lend them-
selves to whichever state of the being leads the activities.
They are parted in astonishment, suspense, and awe; they
are bloodless and compressed in the heat of vital passions,
and they are pursed and drawn in sympathy with mental
endeavor.
Enthusiasts and visionary people habitually carry their
heads elevated, whereas the tendency of grave and thought-
ful habits is to lower the head and eye. Thus the at-
titude of the head frequently denotes the disposition of
the individual.

EMOTIVE DIVISION.
AS the function of the limbs in the divisions of the body
is vital, and that of the head mental, so the emo-
tive nature has its base of operations in the torso, or trunk,
and is the seat of the passions and higher emotions. In the
subdivisions of the torso the region of the lungs appears
to be the seat of the mental nature; the heart, in which
centre the affections, is the dwelling-place of the emotive.
nature; and the vital nature lodges in the abdomen, which
is the headquarters of the appetites. These subdivisions
of the torso are the points for the arrival and departure of
gestures of the hand and arm, which thus indicate the
principle of being predominating in expression. When the
breast heaves and swells under the stimulus of some noble
impulse we know that the mental has invaded the emo-
tive nature, and stirred the being to the projection of some
lofty purpose; and the open hand is laid upon the breast
to show that the individual is committed to a worthy end.
In moments of the highest exaltation the whole being is

said to be poised, when head, heart, and hand are in per-
fect accord, and are united in the pursuit of one great
object. At such times the individual is capable of the high-
est in his nature. The eye lights up, the nostrils dilate, the
color comes and goes, the chest heaves, the limbs move
with unwonted ease and grace, and the whole man be-
comes grander, as indeed he really is; for at such mo-
ments he is incapable of petty things.
If the gesture seeks the heart region, or emotional division,
the affections predominate; when the vital nature rules, the
gestures seek the abdomen, as this is the seat of the appe-
tites and grosser passions. In the second chapter of this
book we call attention to the significance which the undue
prominence of either of these divisions gives to the car-
riage of the body as revealing the nature of the individual.
Egotistical and conceited people express their predomi-
nating characteristic through the prominence of the chest;
as we have previously stated, many people have the abomi-
nable habit of protruding the abdomen.
In a proper carriage or bearing of the torso, the heart
region will be prominent, the abdomen contracted, and the
shoulders flexible and free.
We cannot better conclude this brief consideration of the
divisions of the body than by quoting the physiognomist
Lavater, in support of Delsarte's theory: “These three

states of the soul do not lodge in separate apartments of the
body, but co-exist in every part, and form by their combina-
tion one whole; yet it is true that each of these principles
has its particular place of residence in the body, where it in
preference manifests and exerts itself.”

DELSARTE'S NINE LAWS OF GESTURE.
ALL who have carefully and thoughtfully perused the
preceding chapters will have no difficulty in deter-
mining the fact that we are enabled accurately to convey "
our thoughts and feelings through the medium of the body
in the form of gestures or motion, and that it is possible to
trace every movement of the body back to the sensation,
thought, or emotion which created it.
We are perhaps apt to consider the voice as the most
important agent of expression; and while its power is not
to be denied, when we realize what lasting impressions are
conveyed through the expression of the eye and hand alone,
how they magnetize, influence, interest, and persuade, we are
forced to admit that “ Actions speak louder than words,"
and that gesture is superior to specch. Says Addison,
“ A man's speech is much more easily disguised than
his countenance."
According to his exponents, Delsarte formulated nine laws
of gesture. First, the Law of Motion, which we have already
described as the centre of his system. Motion is force

expending itself. Delsarte was the first to apply the three
modes of motion to the three states of the being. Motion
corresponding to the vital state moves outward from the
centre; motion which corresponds to the mental state
moves inward toward the centre; while the emotive state
is manifested through either outward or inward motions, or
that which is balanced or poised according to the nature
of the emotion.
Delsarte's second law is that of Velocity: “The velocity
of any agent is in proportion to the mass moved and the
force moving.” That is to say, a weighty idea or grave
emotion requires deliberate or slow gestures moving through
large space, while thoughts and emotions of a lighter
character are gestured by short, rapid movements. The
same is true of the voice; grave, deep tones accompany
grand subjects, while lighter tones denote less weighty
feelings.
The third law is that of Direction and Extension. All
gestures must have direction: vital gestures are generally
projected forward from the body or lengthwise, mental ges-
tures are directed above or pointed below, while emotional
gestures are thrown out laterally; and the extension of ges-
ture is shown in the degree of our self-surrender or the
completeness of our giving up to the state by which we
are dominated. It should be borne in mind that these

54
An Hour with Delsarte
definitions apply as well to the inner being and explain the
direction or tendency and bent of thought.
Reaction is Delsarte's fourth law: “Every extreme of
emotion tends to react to its opposite. Concentric states
tend to explosion, and explosion to prostration.” The prin-
ciple is shown in the rebounding of a ball thrown against
a hard wall; it returns to the hand which gave it impetus
with its force diminished only by the resistance of gravita-
tion. This ball may be said to represent the human soul
when the vital nature is supremely dominant.
This state of the being is outwardly shown by great
physical exertion, and is immediately followed by intense
calm, betokening the relaxed state of the mind, which is the
natural consequence of undue excitement. This law is fre-
quently illustrated in the passion of a child which has long
been chafing under the restrictions of maternal discipline.
The child has been forbidden some form of youthful pastime,
which in the maternal instinct seemed harmful; the little
fellow feels that he has been hardly used, and broods over
his trouble, at first sullenly, but afterward more demonstra-
tively. He thinks,“ What a cruel mother I have !” this is
succeeded by angry resentment manifested in kicks and half-
stified murmurs of discontent, which having no effect, the
long pent-up feelings find their climax in a flood of pas-
sionate tears. After this outburst tired nature comes to

the rescue, and the reaction is seen as the infant rebel sobs
himself to sleep
The Law of Form may be defined as the figure or shape
by which matter is presented to the sight. As applied to
gesture, all motion describes certain shapes or forms in
space. Gestures which describe straight lines or forms are
said to be vital; those taking a circular form are emotional ;
while gestures marking broken outlines are mental.
The Law of Personality is that which marks a man's in-
dividuality and distinguishes him from other men. Per-
sonality is the result of heredity and culture. We work
upon the material received at birth from our ancestors,
striving to efface or emphasize its peculiarities accordingly
as they are advantageous or detrimental to us; the result
at manhood, colored by experience, is personality. It is
that by which we recognize a friend by his walk, a mother
by the inflections of her voice as she speaks to her child,
the words of a favorite author by the style of the com-
position.
Delsarte's Law of Opposition: “When two limbs follow
the same direction, they cannot be simultaneous without
injury to the law of opposition; therefore direct move-
ments should be successive and opposite movements sim-
ultaneous.” The law of opposition in gesture has for its
mechanical or physical basis the laws of equilibrium and


## p. 56 (#90) ##############################################

An Hour with Delsarte
gravity. A vertical line directly through the body stand-
ing erect and perfectly poised will mark the centre of
gravity. Any departure of the body from this right line
in any direction must be compensated for by an equal
portion of the body in the opposite direction, else equi-
librium cannot be maintained. Equilibrium is one of the
elements of physical grace; and while there may be equi-
librium without grace, there can be no grace without
equilibrium; so, in gesturing, this law of compensation or
balance must be preserved in the interests of grace. A
gesture by one member of the body demands a compen-
sating gesture by another member in opposition.
If we gesture with the arm, the head moves in opposi-
tion. If we step forward, the head follows the limb; the
body being equal to the head and limb opposes them in
compensation.
The Law of Priority or Sequence of gesture is the order
of succession in which the agents of expression act. “Im-
pression always precedes expression; we must have before
we can give, and give in the order of having,” — which is
equivalent to saying, We must have an idea before we can
express one.
Generally speaking, the vital nature first asserts itself
in gesture, then follows the emotional nature, and the
mental nature is last to act; but, as Delsarte says, “The


## p. 57 (#91) ##############################################

Nine Laws of Gesture
57
will lends itself to whichever side of the being is in action,”
and that side will lead the sequence in gesture.
In the order of priority the eye reveals impressions first,
next the face responds, then the hand and other members
of the body, and, lastly, articulate speech.
Delsarte is reported to have said that “Rhythm is the
vibration or swing of matter through equal spaces and in
equal times.” It is the regular pulsation or beat of mo-
tion corresponding to the throb or wave of emotion; mo-
tion is rhythmic just as waves are undulating; it is the
character or shape of motion. In speech it is the succes-
sive rise and fall of the voice, as in the modulation and
the cadence of the tones in reading. In gesture it is the
consecutive inflections of the limbs from joint to joint in
the movements of the body.

CESTURE is the immediate revelation of the being.
The most evanescent Aashes of thought and tem-
perament are first and immediately revealed in gesture.
The quality of his gesture is the quality of the individual,
and the touchstone to the character of the man. His
speech can be attuned to the occasion; but he betrays him-
self in the quick surprises of involuntary gesture, — in the
sudden tremor of the lip, the startled turn of the head, the
dropping of the jaw, the spasmodic clutch of the hand,
the blush and pallor of the cheeks, and the flashing and
quailing of that sensitive mirror, the eye. And apropos
of the sudden flushing and paling of the cheeks, the French
philosopher, Descartes, observes that while the will may
have some control over the muscles, it has none over the
blood.
Gesture is the language of nature, and is comprehensible
to people of every tongue; whereas their different forms
of speech must be laboriously learned before they can be
employed or understood. The most pacific overtures, when

couched in words, might be misinterpreted by a foreigner,
but a conciliatory movement of the hand is readily appre-
ciated by any race or condition of men.
The character or type of the gestures of different races
varies according to the temperaments of the people, but
the nature or essence of gesture is everywhere the same;
thus, the warm-blooded races of Southern Europe and Asia
make quick, impulsive gestures, in keeping with the activity
of their temperaments; but among the phlegmatic peoples
of the North, the gestures are more deliberate and less
volatile in kind. With the Anglo-Saxon races, on the other
hand, where a greater evenness of temperament prevails,
the gestures are an equable blending of the other two; and
all the many classes of men, with their infinite diversity
of characteristic movements, are but variations of these fun-
damental types. Hence, different men express the same
idea, thought, sentiment, or passion differently, the manner
of each being modified by experience, habit, disposition,
etc. But all men have the same general attributes, distin-
guishable by the special peculiarities of each; so it follows
that certain gestures are common to all men to express
particular emotions, colored only by the individuality of
the person.
For example, profound grief will give to every face a
melancholy or lugubrious effect; but a grief that would

awaken in one person a perfect agony of woe, would be
expressed in a more self-contained nature by an occasional
sigh and a heavy look in the eye, though the degree of
grief were the same in each case. In the same way, a feel-
ing of great surprise is shown in every face by an expansion
of feature, accompanied by a staring look in the eyes; but
a surprise that would have no more effect on some people
than to cause a slight lifting of the eyebrows, would pro-
voke in others a violent start, throwing up of both hands,
and a settled gape, amounting in appearance almost to con-
sternation; yet the surprise may be no more sincerely felt
in the one case than in the other. But it is through these
forms of action or gesture that we learn the secrets of
another's nature.
Of him who has such perfect control of himself that he
makes little or no demonstration over a circumstance which
excites another to much show of feeling, we say that he is
a man of the world and has experienced much, or that his
nature is cold and unresponsive, or that he is hypocritical
and masks his true feelings for his own ends, or that he
is cultivated and politely suppresses them; forming our
own judgment each time not upon this circumstance alone,
but considered in connection with other facts similarly ob-
tained; and by this subtile reasoning we arrive at an estimate
of character. It is the complex nature which makes the

least show of feeling, and the simple one which is the most
demonstrative.
All gesture may be classified conformably with its source
as subjective and objective: it may be called objective
when it refers to and arises from external causes or con-
ditions; it may be called subjective when it is the direct
expression of a purely subjective or mental operation. The
simple gesture made in pointing out a familiar object in a
miscellaneous collection is objective, because it arises from
an external cause; but the involuntary action of raising the
hand to the brow in an effort of the memory is subjective,
because it is a reflection of some state of the mind.
Gestures of the objective class are more frequently seen
in children than those of the subjective kind, because the
mind of childhood is more susceptible of impressions from
without; and it is not until the exercise of the faculties of
reasoning, judgment, etc., begins that certain crude, subjec-
tive gestures are seen, betokening the immaturity of these
qualities. As these functions become fixed, however, and
their true value determined, the revelatory gestures take
on a riper fitness and a settled precision of form in per-
fect keeping with the now advanced development of the
mind.

tangled mental knot? But in maturer years this same child
will reveal a proportionately difficult mental encounter with
perhaps a drawing together of the brows, a pursing of
the lips, a tapping of the fingers, or by some equally mild
form of gesture, betraying the working of the practised
intellect accustomed to this kind of mental gymnastics.
Through these illustrations it is the purpose to bring
forcibly home to the learner the manifest absurdity of pre-
scribing fixed gestures to express particular ideas, than
which no more ridiculous notion has ever prevailed, even
in connection with this ludicrously treated study. Our
minds are as different as our faces; we do not think alike
nor talk alike; then why should we act or walk alike? No
two of us are exactly alike in any particular; then, in just
so much as we are unlike, the difference should appear in
all we do.
A girl of fifteen will not express herself in anything like
a man of fifty; nor will any two girls of fifteen, or men
of fifty, express the same ideas, using precisely the same
words, gestures, or facial expression; each will show his
difference of temperament, habit, disposition, heredity, and
experience from those of each of the others, and these and
other differences of character will color all he does.
All gesture, to be natural, must be unconscious, or seem
to be so; the reason that studied gestures are often stiff,

embarrassed, and self-conscious is that they have not been
sufficiently studied. Says Pope:-
“A little learning is a dangerous thing;
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring."
So a little jaunt into the realms of expression only serves
to show the learner what he lacks, without putting him
into possession of it; there must be no half-heartedness
about his efforts, he must plunge boldly into the stream
and ford it to the source. So thoroughly must he be im-
bued with the subject that he will seem to have appropri-
ated it to himself, — made it, in fact, second nature. Then
all self-consciousness will disappear, per force of circum-
stances. For the special study of gesture the student is
referred to Bacon's “Manual of Gestures,” which is a most
admirable simplification of Austin's “ Chironomia,” the most
important work as yet produced on the subject of gesture.

XII.
THE VOICE. – READING.
D ELSARTE classifies the voice, as he does the other
agents of expression, into three divisions, each
corresponding to one of the three states of the being.
Accordingly the voice, the mere sound, is vital; modu-
lated sound, or tone, is emotive; and articulate speech is
mental.
Again, the pitch of the voice is suggestive of these three
states of the being. In this classification Delsarte defines
the chest voice as the expression of the vital or sensitive
life, the medium voice as the expression of sentiment and
the emotive nature, and the head voice as the correspond-
ence of the mental side of the being.
The head voice is used in expressing purely mental
conditions, like the inward gestures; and the medium or
middle voice is expressive of emotional conditions, like
those gestures which are neither outward nor inward, but
serve as the poise or balance between the two.
These distinctions are by no means definitive; but as in
the divisions of the other agents, the vital or chest voice

is invaded, and in turn invades the emotive or middle voice,
and the same with the head or mental voice.
By this blending and merging of the basal divisions the
same complexity is observable in voice as in the case of
gesture. As there is little or no variation in the cry of
the animal, so there is not much in the tones of elemen-
tary or savage natures among men; and Aexibility of the
voice is never found disassociated with intelligence, because
it is the external sign of intellectuality.
The head tone, or high voice, is heard in the weighing and
balancing of mental problems. The head voice reaches its
highest state of pliancy among the most enlightened peoples.
The chest voice is heard when the animal side of our
nature is dominant; in the vital passions, - hate, anger, etc.,
— if the physical nature overbalances the mental, the chest
voice is more frequently employed than either of the others,
the head voice being often very weak.
The medium voice is heard when neither the mental nor
the vital side of the being is predominant, or when some
condition of the emotive nature is poised. “Every state
of the mind,” says Dr. Rush,“ has its corresponding vocal
signs in some of the varied forms of pitch, force, time, and
quality;” and the slightest inflection of the voice has its
corresponding mental equivalent, just as the inflections of
gesture have.


## p. 66 (#104) #############################################

An Hour with Delsarte
The importance of the voice as an agent of expression
depends, as in the case of the other agents, upon the de-
gree of its flexible strength and the readiness with which
it accommodates itself to the passing phases of thought
and feeling; hence the necessity for cultivating the voice
to its greatest pliancy of modulation.
It is not the purpose here to enter upon a discussion
of the voice in any particular sense; as the subject is of
too much moment, if it were not too extensive, to admit
of anything but the most general treatment. For a more
thorough investigation the student is recommended to a
careful study of Dr. James Rush's exhaustive consideration
of the subject in his “Philosophy of the Human Voice.”
But it is possible, even in the space of a brief chapter,
to throw out suggestions which may awaken the learner
to the importance of the subject and to the necessity for
an understanding of the organs which are concerned in
the production of voice if he would make intelligent use
of his vocal powers.
For example, the well-known resemblance in the physio-
logical formation of the organs of speech to the principle
upon which wind instruments of music are constructed is
of service to the student in helping him to understand the
process of voice production.
The lungs and diaphragm may be likened to the bellows

or pumping power of a church organ; the windpipe
stands for the pipes and tubes, and the larynx for the
reeds. In the production of voice the lungs furnish the
motor element, the larynx the vibrating element, and
the mouth the resonant element, and these three elements
are essential to the creation of all sound.
Primarily, the correct use of the voice is dependent on
the proper exercise of these organs, a free and unforced
habit of inspiration, and a sustained power of expiration in
the management of the breath, together with a clear and dis-
tinct enunciation, without too great preciseness of articu-
lation. The distinguished public reader and instructor, Mr.
George Riddle, assures us that he never gives his pupils
breathing exercises at the outset of their studies, as their
value is not at first understood. If his pupils are unable
to breathe properly he gives them the Ghost Scene from
Hamlet to read; and the futility of attempting the grave,
round periods of the ghost's speeches without diaphragmatic
breathing strikes the learner at once, and the necessity for
breathing lessons is clearly established.
Good reading is a recommendation, just as good man-
ners are a passport; and there is never a time when the
lack of the one or the other may not throw the decision
against us in some project on which we have set our hopes.

Of course the first essential in a reader, from an objective
standpoint, is the command of his voice in order that he
may be able to meet the demands made upon it in a
lengthy vocal effort; and in these days of frequent gath-
erings, public and private, scarcely any one may feel him-
self secure in being unprepared for an occasion when his
shortcomings in this respect may prove a source of mor-
tification and annoyance.
How pathetic sometimes is the spectacle of the person,
unaccustomed to “ that sort of thing," who is suddenly
called upon to read or speak in public! Who will forget
the picture of his constrained and timid manner, or the
effect of his weak voice and monotonous tones addressed
to a friendly face in the front row, leaving the rest of the
house in painful uncertainty as to what it was all about!
Or, on the other hand, how absurd was the way he shouted
to cover up his embarrassment !
By the pompous professor we are told that all we have
to do in order to read well is to be natural; but what is
more natural, if the reader has any sensibility, than that
he should appear unnatural before an audience at first?
It is his very fidelity to nature that causes the mischief.
It is not until he has learned to quell or subjugate cer-
tain natural instincts, which rob him for the time of his
powers, that he is able to present the appearance of

spontaneity and naturalness. For example, timidity de-
prives him of self-possession, and he appears stupid when
he is only frightened.
Ignorance of the quality of his voice causes him to mis-
judge its strength; it fails him, and thus ruins an effort
for which, in other respects, he may have been thoroughly
equipped. And so, in a hundred ways, he must cast him-
self into the relentless school of experience unless fortified
by previous preparatory study.

We have already stated that we have little faith in the
efficacy of printed directions for guidance in the practice
of exercises, because they are almost invariably misinter-
preted and misused by the student. A living interpreter
is required to expound the principles upon which they are
based, in order that extravagance in their use may be
avoided, on the one hand, and that they may not fail of
their purpose through a want of thoroughness in their
application, on the other. Still, as this book would be
incomplete without some reference to the character and
quality of these exercises, the writer desires to outline the
course which she has found most serviceable in her own
practice. They are presented more with a view of sug-
gesting the various forms of gymnastic drill, than with
any intention of enumerating the exercises possible under
the system, which may be extended indefinitely, according
to the ingenuity of the instructor.
1. Examine pupils individually, and point out faulty habits
of carriage and bearing; suggest corrections by reference to
illustrations in the second chapter.
2. Consider the carriage of each in his walk, and point
out inelegancies and other defects, such, for example, as
the fault of walking with a bobbing movement of the body,
wabbling from side to side, or carrying the feet with the
toes pointing inward, etc. Do not attempt any radical

alteration of natural tendencies which are inherent in and
characteristic of the individuals.
A Greek writer has declared that “a man's mind is in
his walk.” Gracefulness in walking requires that the body
be carried erect without stiffness, that the legs swing easily
from the hip-joints, and that the toes be turned slightly
outward and carried on a level with the whole foot. In
turning to retrace one's steps, or in making short turns,
one should pivot lightly on the balls of the feet, not take
three or four steps in a half circle, as many do.
The bearing and carriage of the body having been con-
sidered in this general way, we proceed to examine the
members of the body in detail, beginning with the hand.
Extend your arms forward with the palms down or prone,
energize and move stiffly up and down; now surrender
the hands at the wrist, shake them as before. The object
is to take the mind out of the hands, to let the effort of
the will cease at the wrists. The sensation of freedom or
Aexibility is obtained by repeatedly energizing the hand
and then relaxing or surrendering it. Now, shake the hands
laterally from side to side; forget them, let them go;
remember that you have arms, but no hands, for the time
being. Now turn the hands with the palms facing each
other, give them up as before, and shake them back and
forth, letting the energy cease at the wrist. Now, repeat

the movement with the palms upward; imagine that you
are shaking drops of water from the tips of your fingers.
Now, the rotary movement; turn the hand round and round
from right to left; now, reverse the movement and turn
them from left to right. Next, hold the hands facing each
other, the sides downward, and shake them freely as you
would in a gesture of threatening. Next, rest your fore-
arm on the arm of your chair; now cut the energy off at
the wrist. We must obtain perfect fexibility of this agent,
which in some people extends to the fingers, giving them
the same freedom as at the wrist.
These movements we call flexing or freeing exercises,
because they render flexible or supple the agent thus
treated, and free it from the bias of customary forms of
action. By this means the way is opened for the intro-
duction of unaccustomed forms.
From the hands we proceed step by step to each divi-
sion of the limbs and body, subjecting each to this freeing
and flexing process, until the entire body becomes readily
responsive to the slightest calls of the will.
Raise the arms and extend them laterally with the mo-
tion made in swimming. Free the fore-arms, letting the
energy cease at the elbow; with the arms in this position
agitate the upper arm up and down, forward and backward,
and rotarily, or with a rotary motion, letting the fore-arm

swing as if dead. This exercise frees the arms from the
elbows down, and gives Alexibility and suppleness to the
muscles of the upper arm.
Standing in a position of perfect ease, allow the arms to
hang naturally at the sides; now, energize or stiffen the
arms and bring them slowly together with the backs of the
hands meeting just before the hips at the lowest altitude;
holding them thus for an instant, relax and let them fall
back to their usual position. Again, energize the arms
and carry them forward and upward, holding them ex-
tended at full length to a horizontal position before the
chest; relax and let them fall into place as before. Re-
peat the movement, carrying the arms this time to a po-
sition just above or on a level with the eyes; relax as
before, letting them drop lifelessly into place.
Again, stiffen the arms to a rigid tension, and holding
them at full length, carry them up sidewise until they
meet, the backs of the hands together, directly over the
head. Agitate the hands as in the preceding exercises
for the hands, relax and drop them. Again this move-
ment, carrying the arms above the head, but as far back
as possible, and finally relax and allow them to fall into
place.
Standing in the same position, elevate the shoulders as
much as possible; relax them, and allowing the arms to

hang lifelessly, freely agitate the rest of the body. Carry
the shoulders forward as much as possible, neither raising
nor depressing them; relax them, and agitate the body
as before. Depress or slightly droop the shoulders, then
slowly carry them backward and upward, and finally down-
ward, expanding the chest to its fullest extent; relax and
agitate the body as before. Rotate the shoulders forward
several times, then backward; then swing the arms round
and round, letting them revolve in their sockets.
These exercises, besides freeing the muscles of the chest
and shoulders and relieving them of stiffness and angu-
larity, will, if perseveringly practised, materially expand
and enlarge the chest, thus promoting the healthy action
of the lungs.
Sitting, holding the head in its normal position midway
between the shoulders, neither raised nor depressed, allow
it gradually to droop forward until it loses balance and
falls inertly upon the chest. Returning it to its normal
position, allow it to droop backward until it falls upon the
neck. Returning again to normal poise, allow the head
to fall first to the right, then, repeating the movement, let
it fall to the left. Now, with a rotary motion allow the
head to roll freely on the shoulders, first to the right, then,
reversing, let it roll to the left. The object of these ex-
ercises, it will be readily seen, is to give perfect freedom

to the movements of the head by imparting flexibility to
the muscles of the neck; this object is not fairly accom-
plished until you are able to simulate through the head
the passive pliancy of one in a dead faint or in a state of
unconsciousness.
Sitting erect in your chair, allow the head and shoulders
to droop forward, breaking the trunk at the first joint of
the chest, but holding the waist rigid. Beginning in the
same position again, allow the head to fall backward,
drawing the shoulders with it, but maintaining rigidity of
the waist as before.
Again, droop the head to the right, allowing it to ele-
vate the left and depress the right shoulder by the force
of its own weight, still holding the waist immovable; repeat
the movement to the left; now, turn the head and shoulders
round with a rotary motion which alternately raises and
depresses the shoulders as they follow the movement of
the head. Still sitting erect, rotate the upper body on the
hip joints, letting the motion flow sinuously through the
joints of the spine and ribs; reverse the action, turning
in the opposite direction.
Rise in your places, and standing at perfect ease, allow
the upper body to fall lifelessly forward, arresting the ac-
tion at the waist line; repeat the action, falling backward;
again, falling to the right and then to the left.

Now, letting the upper body fall forward, arresting the
action at the waist line as before, rotate the inert trunk to
the right by means of the hip joints and muscles; reverse
the movement, turning to the left.
Resume your seats, and lifting the right foot from the
floor, agitate it freely, as in the exercises for the hand;
rotate the foot at the ankle to the right and to the left;
repeat this exercise with the left foot.
Again, standing up, agitate the right leg from the knee,
as in the exercises for the arm; now with a rotary motion
to the right, and reversing to the left. Throw the limb
forward, imitating the pawing of the horse; repeat these
with the left foot and leg.
Standing on some elevated position, — a footstool, or on
the edge of a step or platform, -- swing the whole leg loosely
from the hip joint; in lieu of the rotary motion, which is
impossible, throw the right leg about the left, letting it
dangle loosely from the hip; repeat this exercise with the
left leg.
Allow the eyelids to fall and lower jaw to drop.
Having freed the various joints and hinges of the body
from their enclosures of stiffness and angularity, and given
flexibility to the muscles at the same time, let us now turn
our attention to building up those muscles which from dis-
use or bodily ailment have become weakened, and observe

that by taking up the work of strengthening the body in
this order, after the freeing and flexing process rather than
before, we avoid emphasizing and confirming, as it were,
the faults which we have just been at so much pains to
overcome.
Stand with the heels together, the toes pointing at right
angles, and rise slowly and steadily on the toes to the
highest point attainable with an even balance, and down in
the same manner, repeating the exercise until the move-
ment can be accomplished almost imperceptibly. Next,
pivot on the balls of the feet from right to left, reverse
and repeat over and over several times.
With the feet in the same position, keeping the body
erect, bend the knees as far as possible without lifting the
heels from the floor or losing the balance. To give elas-
ticity to the lower limbs, stand in position, the heels a few
inches apart, the toes pointing outward at right angles,
with a springy, dancing movement of the body, take a step
forward and back to place, first with the right foot, then
with the left, springing slightly on the balls of the feet as
in waltzing and marking time rhythmically, — one, two, for-
ward and back to place on the right foot; three, four,
forward and back to place on the left; repeating the
movement backwards, – one, two, backward and forward
to place on the right foot ; three, four, backward and for-

ward to place on the left foot; continue the movement to
the right and to the left, pointing the toes of the foot on
which the step is taken obliquely from the body, and
marking time as before.
Although Delsarte made the study of the human voice
his chiefest concern, the loss of his own voice having
quickened his perception in respect to that organ, it is
none the less a deplorable fact that little remains to us of
his authentic achievements in its behalf.
For a specific study of the voice, therefore, the student
is referred to Mr. James E. Murdoch’s “Analytic Elocu-
tion,” which is a simplified interpretation of “The Phi-
losophy of the Voice” by Dr. James Rush, and contains,
besides, many notes and observations gathered during Mr.
Murdoch's long and varied experience as actor, reader,
and teacher.
We give below the fundamental breathing exercises which
should be considered in connection with the flexing and
freeing forms. There are three forms of breathing in which
all language, from simple narration to the most violent
burst of passion, is presented.
In a simple statement of fact the breath flows from the
organs in a gentle, steady stream.
First Breathing Exercise. — Stand in an easy position,
the weight resting on the balls of the feet, the arms hang-

ing loosely at full length in the back, the fingers lightly
caught together; in this position fill the lungs by deep,
slow, and full respiration. After a short pause, during which
the breath is retained, part the lips and let the breath pass
out in a gentle, steady whisper of the word “he;" lips
moderately opened, corners drawn back. Endeavor to
economize the breath in this exercise as much as possible,
giving it out as slowly and steadily as you can.
In any emotional utterance the physical organism is
stimulated to greater exertion and the breath rushes fronı
the organs.
Second Breathing Exercise. — Fill the lungs as before,
and then expel the breath in a forcible whispered breath-
ing of the syllable “hah;” the mouth more open, lips
slightly rounded.
In extremely passionate expression the breath seems to
burst into the outer air impelled by a powerful effort of
the vocal mechanism.
Third Breathing Exercise. — After a full inspiration ex-
pel the air suddenly in a violent whispered utterance of
the syllable "halt;” the mouth must be widely opened
and the whisper coming from well back in the throat.
Give the above exercises with vocal sound.
An excellent breathing exercise consists in filling the
lungs and then sounding the long vowel ā, holding it on

a level line of pitch as long as it is round and does not
become vibratory; then take ē, i, o, and ū in the same
manner; this is an excellent vocal gymnastic exercise;
practice on it gives a steady control of the diaphragm
and makes the tones of the voice round, firm, and clear.

IT is a rule in all harmonic movements that the head
shall follow in the direction in which the weight of
the body is thrown; that is, in the direction taken by the
leg which bears the weight of the body; at the same time
the trunk moves in opposition. This rule is founded on
the laws of equilibrium and sustained by the canons of
grace.
Exercise 1. Stand with the feet slightly apart, toes
nearly on a line, the weight resting equally on both feet;
slowly sway the body forward until its weight rests en-
tirely on the balls of the feet, but without lifting the heels
from the floor; in the same manner sway backward as far
as possible with the weight entirely on the heels. Avoid
overbalancing
Exercise 2. With the feet in the same position, weight
resting equally on both, withdraw the weight gradually
from the left leg, giving it entirely to the right, the head
following the direction of the weight and the trunk taking
the opposite direction; now reverse the movement, grad-

ually withdrawing the weight from the right leg, give it
over to the left, the head and trunk moving in opposition
as before.
Exercise 3. Stand with the right foot advanced so that
the head is about on a line with the toes of the left, the
weight equally borne by each; gradually transfer the
weight to the advanced leg until the weight is entirely
borne by that member, the head following the direction
of the weight, and the trunk, or torso, moving in opposi-
tion as before. Repeat this exercise with the left foot
advanced.
Let the student try moving the head and trunk both in
the direction of the advanced leg, and the loss of equi-
librium, or balance, which will result is the most convincing
proof of the mechanical as well as the æsthetical value of
the oppositions.
Exercise 4. Stand with one foot advanced as before, the
weight equally sustained by each foot, rotate the entire
body at the ankles, the waist describing the direction taken
and the head following in opposition. In all of these
exercises the movements must be sinuous, not angular,
and the transitions must be accomplished with something
of the subtilty of feline grace, the movement touching
successively every joint and articulation in the course over
which it travels.

E.rercise 5. Sit in a chair with the spinal articulations
lying easily against the back of the chair, chest and shoul-
ders relaxed, but not drooping, with the body in a purely
passive attitude; move the trunk, or torso, forward, first
energizing at the waist as the objective point, the energy
extending successively to the chest, shoulders, and head,
the latter, which sympathizes with the weight, following
the trunk in graceful opposition, until the attitude is one
of animated activity. Now reverse the movement, allow-
ing the trunk to sink slowly back, the waist leading and
the head following in opposition as before, until the first
position of negative inactivity is resumed. It will be ob-
served that with the body in this position, the spinal
column describes the arc of a circle and is convex, while
the breast is concave; but in the forward movement, when
the body is fully animated, the position is just reversed,
and the breast is convex while the back is then concave.
Exercise 6. Sitting in the same attitude as in beginning
the last exercise, move the trunk obliquely forward to the
right until the body is highly energized, then reverse the
movement, allowing the trunk to return to its position of
passive ease, observing in this precisely the same principle
as in the last exercise. Now repeat this exercise by making
the movement obliquely to the left and back; then vary
it by moving directly to the right side and back, then to

the left side and back. Finally, rotate the trunk forward
to the position of greatest strength and relax, returning to
the inactive poise, – the waist describing a half circle for-
ward and a half circle backward. Reverse the movement,
rotating forward in the opposite direction and then back.
Exercise 7. Begin practising the harmonic expansion
of the hand by closing the tips of the fingers in a cluster
about the tips of the thumbs, the hands being held up
before the breast ; then with an even, regular movement
expand the hands, at the same time withdrawing them in
opposite directions until they are wide apart, and fully
open. Now, begin slowly to close them, bringing them
together at the same time until the tips of the fingers
cluster about the tips of the thumbs as before. The hands
before the breast in the same manner, placing the tips of
the second and third fingers against the tips of the thumbs,
expand the hands, separating them as before, until they
are far apart and both are wide open; then return them
to place with the same smooth, flowing motion. This ex-
ercise tends to educate immobile and expressionless hands
to that state of lightness and pliancy which goes so far to
impart a meaning and purpose to gesture.
Exercise 8. Referring to Chapter VII., assume succes-
sively the simple or fundamental attitudes of the body

for Harmonic sition from each assumption the harmonious principles
described above.
A passing or transitory gesture is called an inflection;
an arrested inflection is called an attitude; and an habitual
attitude is called a bearing.
The hand has three sides or faces, — the palm, the back,
and the edges, — and one of these is always presented
in gesture. In describing the hand, Delsarte invests the
palm with the office of revealing the vital nature; the
back he makes the agency of the emotive nature, and
in the sides he finds an agreement or accordance with the
mental nature. It is the business of the hand in gesture
to define, which it does with the index finger or the open
hand agitated perpendicularly ; to indicate, by pointing
with the fore-finger, or by a toss of the hand toward the
object ; to assert, by throwing out one or both hands,
palms supine ; to affirm, by placing or slapping the fore-
finger, or two fingers, or the whole hand into the palm of
the other, or by slapping the hand or pounding the fist
on any convenient surface, as in heated discussion.
An affirmation is an emphasized assertion ; the hand
denies by being raised perpendicularly, palm outward, lat-
erally toward the one who is the object of the denial.
Rejection is often a mild form of denial, and is expressed
in the hand by holding it dependent from the wrist with

the back presented, and agitating it forward and back
with a sort of pushing movement. Impatience is mani-
fested by the hand in a restless tapping of the fore-finger,
or the opening and closing of the fists, or a snapping of
the fingers and thumb. In the act of concealment the
back of the hand is shown, the palm being toward the
object to be concealed; while in revealment the palm is
exposed.
The hand inquires by being raised extended, palm pre-
sented, fingers and thumb slowly expanding and directed
at an angle upwards. Acquiescence is shown by a slight
waving apart of the hands, fingers pointing downward,
palms presented. Anger is sometimes declared by the
tightly clinched fists. Malicious triumph is betrayed by
the feverish rubbing of the hands as in washing them;
self-complacency by the soft friction of the palms.
The hand caresses by tenderly stroking or patting the
object of the attention. The hand expresses the idea
of moral support by being held out horizontally, palms
supine. These and a great variety of mental operations
are revealed in the inflections of the hand ; as, for in-
stance, the slow moving of the thumb over the tips of
the fingers to denote the exercise of reflection, reasoning,
and the efforts of formulating thought.
Exercise 9. The student is recommended to the con-

stant practice of these and of the attitudes of the hands
shown in the postures described in Chapter VII., with
others of his own devising ; this practice, if persistently
followed, will speedily deliver the pupil from the monotony
of a few habitual gestures, by imparting a variety of ex-
pressive coloring to his movements.
Exercise 10. Standing in a normal position, raise the
right arm by means of the wrist to a level with the waist
and energize it ; holding it thus before you at a slight
angle with the floor, describe the figure eight, moving
with a light, wavy motion of the hand, progressing to the
right as far as the arm will move gracefully ; repeat this
exercise with the left arm, progressing to the left, then
with both arms.
Exercise II. In the same position, elevate the arm by
means of the wrist to a level with the shoulder and
energize it, as before ; now, with the same yielding
motion, as last described, outline the character eight on
the opposite wall, moving to the right as before, until the
space of a quadrant has been covered ; again, repeat with
the left arm, then with both.
Exercise 12. Again, by means of the wrists elevate
the arms until they are directed toward the ceiling, then
energize them, and throw the outline of the figures above
the head, covering a quarter circle, as before. Repeat

once more with the left arm, and then with both arms ;
vary this exercise by presenting the edges of the hand
and cutting the figures sidewise, instead of with the palm.
Exercise 13. Raise the right arm directly in front of you,
wrist directing, palm down, energize on a plane just below
the chest; now move to the right, the elbow leading, let-
ting the movement flow into the wrist and hand; then
reverse, bringing the hand back to the body, marking the
articulations successively at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist
as you do so, just as you would strike a broken chord of
music. A common fault with stiff, awkward people is that
they move not only their arms, but all parts of the body,
as if it were one piece, and not composed of parts hung
together by joints which, whenever the leg, waist, or arm
are moved, must all speak, as it were; repeat the above
exercise with the left arm, then with both; again practise
them with the palms of the hand upward.
Exercise 14. Again extend the arms directly in front,
wrist leading, rotate arm, the hand passive, energize, close
fingers in hand, close wrist, close elbow, raise elbow hori-
zontally on a line with the shoulders, unfold elbow, unfold
wrist, unfold fingers, and finally expand and energize the
entire arm; now return to first position by closing fingers,
closing wrist, closing elbow, dropping elbow, then unfold
elbow, unfold wrist, unfold fingers, energize the entire arm

in front, palm upward, now surrender the arm to its normal
position; repeat this exercise many times, until you can
close and unfold the joints of the arm freely and rapidly
in any and all directions and at any altitude.
The law of harmony demands that parallel movements
shall be consecutive; that is, one agent of expression lead-
ing, the others following, and that the movement of two
agents in opposition shall be made simultaneously.
Exercise 15. The mind directs the body to move right,
the right arm follows the inclination of the body, the wrist
leading; next the left arm follows the right, the wrist lead-
ing; the head has simultaneously moved to the left in
opposition; now reverse the movement, moving the body
and arms successively and rhythmically to the left, at the
same time moving the head to the right; repeat the move-
ment obliquely to the right and then to the left, raising
the arms to different altitudes.
Exercise 16. Bow the body at waist line; as you do so
raise the arms back in opposition.
Exercise 17. Bow the head on the chest, simultaneously
raising the arms, wrists leading; now raise the head as you
lower the arms.
Exercise 18. Assume the attitude of vehemence, the
right leg forward and strong with the knee bent; at the
same time raise the left arm forward obliquely and the right

arm backward obliquely; with a slight elastic spring re-
sume a normal position; now reverse, taking a marked step
forward with the left foot, at the same time raising the
right arm, wrist leading, obliquely to the right, and the
left arm obliquely backward and to the left; now resume
a normal poise, which is the correct position when in
repose; repeat these steps over and over again until they
can be taken accurately, with the arms in perfect opposi-
tion, as fast as they can be called off.
Exercise 19. Continue the study of the arms by con-
sidering the shoulder, which when raised indicates sensi-
bility, or an emotion of extreme joy or hate, as must be
determined by the expression of the face. Grief, pros-
tration, or concentration droops the shoulders.
Exercise 20. Assume the different attitudes of the
elbow; subordination of self turns the elbows in, while
assertion and self-conceit turn them outward.
Exercise 21. Consider the attitudes of the entire arm;
when in repose they fall just in front of the hips.
The arms crossed lightly on the breast indicates a spirit-
ual resignation of the will; if they are tightly folded and
raised on a level with the shoulders, it indicates suppressed
passion or a concentration of vital force.
The hands resting on the hips, the elbows turned out,
indicates impertinence, self-assertion, boasting; the arms

carried directly forward, hands prone, fingers widely sep-
arated and energized, the body simultaneously moving
backward in opposition, is the expression of passionate ex-
plosion, which is the result of a concentration of strong
feeling.
Exercise 22. Assume the attitude of exaltation, right leg
advanced and strong, that is, bearing the entire weight
simultaneously; raise the right arm with a spiral move-
ment to the highest altitude, the fore-finger prominent;
now make a transition of the weight to the left leg, simul-
taneously raising the left arm with a spiral movement into
an attitude of vindication; the right arm will be slightly
raised and to the right, hand prone.
Exercise 23. Kneel on the left knee, the left hand on
the chest and the right arm extended in appeal; rise and
kneel on the right knee, simultaneously clasping the hands
in front of the chest in entreaty; rise and kneel on the
left knee, at the same time extending both arms in sup-
plication; repeat this over and over again, first on one
knee and then on the other.
Exercise 24. We are told that "harmony was born of
contrasts.” We will continue our practice of the opposi-
tion between the head and arm by first raising the right
arm as we lower the head on the chest; next carry the
arm to the right, striking all the notes or articulations,

simultaneously carrying the head to the left; now raise
the left arm as you carry the head back to normal poise
midway between the shoulders; now lower the head as you
cross hands upon the breast; now raise the head as you
expand the arms horizontally; finally surrender the arms,
letting them drop at the side in normal position; repeat
the exercise, the left arm leading.
Exercise 25. Now we will try a more complex com-
bination. Standing in a correct position of repose, raise
the right arm and rotate it into an attitude of appeal; now
energize the arm, at the same time lowering the chin as in
accusation; next swing the arm over the head, the hand
in the attitude of exasperation, head lowered, chin thrown
forward as in cursing; next drop the hand on the back of
the head, which has risen in opposition to meet it, — the
attitude indicates remorse (the attitude would be strength-
ened if the left hand were on the chest or carried to the
back of the head also); now, without separating the head
and arm, allow them to fall on the chest in deep thought
or grief; now raise the head and rotate to the right, which
will allow the arm to fall across the chest, and you have
an attitude signifying reproach; now rotate the head to
the left and the arm to the right, and the attitude is that
of rejection or repulsion; raise the left arm, rotate the
head to a position midway between the shoulders, rotate

THE HEAD, EYE, NOSE, MOUTH, AND MECHANICAL
MOVEMENTS.
A WELL-POISED head is the fitting accompaniment of
- a shapely person, and usually bespeaks a well-or-
dered mind, and goes far besides to atone for the physical
imperfections of other members, being the objective point
of the line of vision and therefore most constantly under
the criticism of the eye.
We admire an elastic step, a yielding curve of the pliant
arm, and a supple grace in the carriage of the body; but
add to these the charm of a nicely balanced head, and the
picture is complete; we have the finished grace of an
undoubted personal bearing.
A normal poise of the head requires that it shall be
carried midway between the shoulders, neither raised nor
depressed. The ruling state of the being is revealed
through the various attitudes of the head. For instance,
a person of a sympathetic nature who is full of trust and
tenderness will habitually incline the head forward or
toward the object of his esteem; while, on the contrary,
a person who is cold, unsympathetic, and distrustful will

habitually and naturally withdraw the head backward. Bear-
ing in mind that motion is in obedience to the thought
or emotion which created it, it will readily be seen that
reflection, humility of spirit, subordination of self, and all
kindred sentiments will concentrate or lower the head
upon the chest; and if the sentiment be a complex one of
humility, trust, and affection, we have the spiritual attitude
of veneration or adoration, which is also complex in that
it is first lowered and then inclined forward with an upward
inflection.
In the same way the complex feelings of scrutiny and
distrust will produce an attitude of suspicion, jealousy, hate,
or envy, which first lowers the head and then draws it
backward. All emotions of exaltation throw the head up-
ward; if the feeling of exaltation is invaded by that of
trust and resignation, it first throws the head backward and
then forward with an upward inflection. If the feeling of
distrust and self-assertion is mingled with that of exaltation,
we have the attitude of arrogance or defiance; the head
is first thrown upward and then drawn backward. The
study of the attitudes of the head and those of all parts
of the body, especially the various expressions of the eye,
nose, and mouth, should be carefully practised before a
mirror.
Most people consult their mirrors for the single purpose

of seeing their attractiveness ; we should study them for
the purpose of seeing ourselves as others see us. The
study of the profile view of the face and head should
not be omitted : some features will bear a straight profile
view; others of a warmer nature look best with a convex
exposure of the features ; still others require that the
head be turned away.
THE EYE.
In the law of sequence or priority the eye is the first
agent of expression to respond to the workings of the
mind, and reveals its rest or activity. Quick, restless move-
ments of the eye are not an indication of intellectual
activity ; it is only so when the glance is observant as
well as quick. Intellectual sluggishness is revealed through
the slow movements of the muscles of the eyeball. Active,
energetic, practical people have a direct, near glance, while
speculative dreamers look far away. The muscles about
the eye are the active agents of expression. “The eyeball
is simply an indicator of the direction from which an im-
pression comes or to which an impression goes.”
THE NOSE.
When we are in a normal condition, – that is, free from
any particular emotion or excitement, — the nostrils, like


## p. 99 (#149) #############################################

The Mouth

the other agents of expression, are in repose. Excitement
and passion dilate the nostrils; while with people who are
selfish, hard, and cruel, the nostrils are contracted.
People who are aggressive in temperament manifest
their natures by wrinkling the nose laterally between the
eyebrows ; if a feeling of cruelty is added to that of
aggression, we have the expression of hate, which also
contracts the nostrils. Scorn and anger also dilate the
nostrils. Contempt raises the nostrils and contracts them.
The nose plays a greater part in the expression of the
face than we are apt to imagine, and is consequently
often overlooked.
THE MOUTH.
The mouth, like the nose, plays its part in expression,
and corresponds with the other agents: when in repose
the lips are normal or lightly closed; firmness of purpose
compresses them tightly together; and if there is any ad-
ditional feeling of disapproval the corners of the mouth
will be depressed. Abandon and suspense slightly part
the lips, while in astonishment they are completely apart.
Grief depresses the corners of the mouth, lips slightly
apart; while horror parts the lips widely, corners much
depressed. Joy and pleasure elevate the corners of the
mouth and slightly part the lips, while approval closes

them. The expression of an otherwise attractive, face is
often sadly marred by the habitual drooping of the corners
of the mouth ; it usually accompanies imaginary troubles
or a sour disposition.
HOW TO SIT.
Settle into your seat; do not drop, nor flop, nor bounce,
nor plump into it. If the seat is an arm-chair, rest one
hand lightly on the arm, and carry the head slightly for-
ward in bending the body as it inclines toward the seat;
settle pliantly backward, touching the back of the chair at
the waist-line first, and successively each joint in the artic-
ulations of the back until the neck is reached and the
head falls easily into a restful attitude. Many well-mean-
ing people make those about them feel uncomfortable by
sitting rigidly erect like vestry deacons or court function-
aries. To put others at their ease you should be at ease
yourself. Sit in repose, the muscles relaxed; do not ener-
gize the shoulders and limbs in bending forward as if you
were built on a movable frame; move with suppleness,
letting your action be reflectively shown in all parts of
the body.
HOW TO BOW.
In polite usage the pretentious formal bow is no longer
decorous; it has been superseded by the mere graceful

inclination of the body, bending slightly from the ankles;
and this form prevails both on the platform and in the
parlor. Out of vogue too is the familiar nod of the head
in recognizing another. An inclination of the body is the
genteel form of recognition, which has the merit of being
graceful as well.
The agents of expression having been studied in detail,
and the mechanical action of all parts of the body having
been in a degree mastered, it has been found desirable
to arrange an attractive series of mechanical movements
which should call into play all the muscles of the body,
and which should be practised in regular order to suitable
music. In the first place, the music is inspiring and makes
a pleasure out of what might otherwise seem a task; be-
sides, it has the additional value of taking the pupil's mind
away from himself and of allowing him to make the move-
ments unconsciously, which is of the highest importance.
Every teacher will arrange his own order of what might
perhaps be termed exhibitions illustrative of the underly-
ing principles of the system; this will be based upon his own
personal taste and experience, and must be executed with
accuracy and precision, accustoming the class to rapid and
true transitions from one movement or attitude to another,
frequently varying the order of the transitions, that they

may be elastic both in mind and body, readily responding
to any and all conditions of thought and expression.
A very good plan is to begin by practising the walk;
select a quiet air by which the class can walk (not march)
easily and naturally about the room. Let the music change
to the air of “Home, Sweet Home," the walk changing
to suit the music; let the whole body assume the attitude
of reflection or concentration: the steps are taken very
slowly, the weight lingering on the advanced foot, the
back foot raised very gradually. Now let the music sud-
denly change to “ The House is Haunted” or any similar air,
which will enable the class to change the slow, concentric
walk to that of secrecy and stealth; let the arms and
body assume the attitude of attention or eagerness, take
the steps cautiously almost on tiptoe; let each member of
the class regard another with alternating expressions and
gestures of secrecy, admonition, gentle warning, and co-
quetry; let the class move noiselessly about the room
keeping step with the rhythm of the music. Now let the
music change to “Amaryllis ” or any minuet time; let every
other one in the class join hand with the one in front, and
move about the room to the stately time of the music,
alternating the steps and attention outward, or at right
angles, and then inward toward each other; then let
the music change to the first movement, and so on;

this exercise will be found very attractive and very
improving
Numberless exercises can be devised for the arm move-
ments, suiting the motions to whatever music may be se-
lected, or vice versa. In our own work we have found it
desirable to have the music specially composed and ar-
ranged to suit the action. The air of “ The Shepherd
Boy” can be followed very easily by starting with the
weight first on the left leg; as the music begins let the
body and right arm move right, the wrist carrying the hand,
which is passive to the highest altitude; suddenly suspend,
the body falling into normal position at the same time; let
the movement flow rhythmically into the left side and sus-
pend as before; finally take the movement up horizon-
tally with both arms, bringing them back with control,
to suit the music, and finishing with a little rotary
motion of the hands; repeat this process by raising the
arms directly in front of you, then repeat carrying them
obliquely to the right and left; now repeat the entire
process from beginning to end, only instead of suspend-
ing the arm when you have it raised to the highest
altitude, reverse the wrist and bring the arm back with
control, letting the movement flow through all the articu-
lations of the arm and the movement of each arm be
taken up instantly with the cessation of the other. A

little air called “The Flower Song” is very pretty for
this exercise. If you like you can repeat this entire pro-
cess by giving impulse to the movement from the upper
arm instead of the wrist, letting a feeling of prostration
gradually bring the arm back to its normal position. The
process of writing the figure eight at different altitudes, as
previously described, and what is sometimes termed the
“ feather movement” is very pretty practised to light music.
Next, practise the oppositions by arraying the class in
rows across the further end of the room; let them advance
to suitable music, first stepping forward with the right foot
and simultaneously raising the left arm forward and the
right arm backward; then step forward with the left foot
and simultaneously raise the right arm forward and the
left arm backward; let the steps and movements of the
arm flow rhythmically one with the other; advance the class
as far as the limits of the room will allow, and then let
them retreat with the same movements. Now arrange a
series of attitudes expressive of various sentiments or emo-
tions, after the manner elsewhere described and illustrated
in this book; don't compel every member of the class to
assume the attitude just exactly alike; let each convey the
idea in the way that is most characteristic and becoming
to himself, that having been decided upon previous to
the ensemble exercise. Select some music which consists

of a succession of chords; let the class assume the various
attitudes and hold each through one or two bars of music;
close the series with an attitude which will make a strong
climax, such as the command “Go,” or exaltation, resig-
nation, or triumph.

W H O has not rapturously listened to a good story-
teller! Who has not eagerly followed him word
by word from rise to climax, and laughed at and heartily
applauded the point! No matter apparently how indiffer-
ent the story itself may be, that is something we neither
have time nor care to consider; we only know that it
pleases us, but just how or by what means we do not
stop to analyze, and we never discover until we hear the
same story fall utterly flat, or lose half its charm on the
lips of another; then we first realize that it was the story-
teller, not the story, which most attracted us. How often
the same is true of a play! We recall its name and the
qualities of the well-remembered characters, and we are
in the habit of ascribing the pleasurable sensations which
accompany these recollections to the meriť of the play
itself; but what we recall, what really afforded us pleasure,
was oftentimes only the charm of the actor's personality,
and not any feature of the play at all. The proof of this

is seen when we witness the same play given with an infe-
rior cast, and wonder what there was in that play that so
interested us once. Herein is shown the soundness of the
plea so generally advocated for the possession of unques-
tioned natural endowment in those who adopt the stage
for their calling; and while the feasibility of cultivating
natural gifts is not here denied, but on the contrary is
strongly supported, no intelligent exponent of Delsarte
will pretend that these gifts can be acquired or their ab-
sence supplied by any substitute, through any system of
inculcation yet invented.
So the question resolves itself into a discussion of ways
and means: given the natural or crude material, the prob-
lem is, how shall that material be made most available in
the shortest time? Shall we have a systematic plan of
study, as in the other arts and professions; or shall the
student of the stage alone, of all students, be compelled to
submit the development of his talents to the caprice of
chance and irregular study, and be obliged to content
himself with an empirical self-graduation in lieu of the
diploma of proficiency honorably conferred by a recog-
nized institution or qualified body?
This is the question; and until it is answered, only the
most masterful gifts can ever hope for complete expansion
and recognition; the prize is inaccessible to many admi-

rably endowed who are debarred from the lists through
purely circumstantial disqualifications, which are unknown
to other artistic pursuits. Under the present conditions
brass is more valuable than brains, and many who are
destitute of that very useful attribute are shut out en-
tirely in consequence.
This condition is especially lamentable in this day of
marvellous accuracy in stage productions, when the public
taste, grown fastidious through familiarity with the stage
triumphs of master intellects, demands a greater and
greater degree of proficiency in him who would win the
highest honors. Once the actor was a vagabond; now he
cannot succeed in the best sense of the term unless he is
a gentleman. He must not only have the gift, but he must
be able to make the best use of it. He must be interest-
ing personally; and to be this requires something more
than the possession of a good voice and presence and the
ability to spout blank verse.
To be interesting demands the skilful exercise of the
many subtile graces of mind and person which are more
intuitive and inspirational than acquisitional. The modern
school of acting appears to foster the growth of entertain-
ing peculiarities in the individual, and to discard the per-
functory performance of the imitators of traditionary
models; and we recognize quaint portraitures of character

types to-day which would have been tabooed as blemishes
less than a quarter of a century back.
It is a very simple matter to imitate that which is infe-
rior to our own development; the difficult thing is to
represent that which is superior. There is a wide distinc-
tion between a material and a mental differentiation of
character. The former imitates the singularities of the
person: it is objective or external; the latter illustrates
peculiarities of the mind: it is subjective or internal. The
one attacks the eccentricities of character from without,
the other from within; the one studies an individual and
photographs him; the other studies individuals of a class
and reproduces a type. The one copies, the other cre-
ates. This distinction is aptly shown in the masterly psy-
chological studies of Henry Irving, whose towering intel-
lectual strength is able to sweep out of sight, or thrust
into the background, the most striking of physical marks,
leaving the mind to the undiverted contemplation of the
wonderful creations of his genius.
Viewed from an artistic standpoint, the material side of
our nature is antagonistic to the spiritual; and whichsoever
of the two is in the ascendency, or is predominant in our
nature, that side overshadows and belittles the other. If
the material or physical man is superior to the intellec-
tual, then for art purposes the intellectual or spiritual man

is ineffectual ; because in the efforts of the spiritual to
manifest itself, the presence of the material so completely
dominates consciousness that the sense of the spiritual is
obliterated.
In the domain of art, the function of the body is to
reflect the soul ; it is the material expression of the im-
material part of us ; it is only when the intellectual holds
an undoubted supremacy over the physical, as in the case
of the famous artist named above, that we lose sight of
the material altogether and enjoy a feast of the spirit.
This is the test of greatness; those only are great who
have so disciplined the body that it has become the servile
creature of the soul, mirroring with equal truth its lightest
fancies and its gravest thoughts, at the master's will.
This is the end ; to reach this end in the shortest pos-
sible time is the desideratum, and it is the raison d'être of
countless theories, systems, and speculations, all of which
contain elements of truth, and have contributed their quota
to the sum of accumulated facts. To reach this end is of
more importance to us than the means we shall employ
to do it.
The possession of the thing is what we aim at, not the
means of possessing it ; and having obtained the thing,
we enjoy the possession without troubling ourselves about
how we came into it. To learn to express what we feel

of human nature and know of human character, this is
the primary consideration ; how or by what process of
training we shall attain to this knowledge is a secondary
matter; but we must have training. No natural talent is
sufficient of itself. No natural endowment can be exer-
cised at its best without the discipline of experience to give
it breadth and scope, and the wider the experience the
broader the result. The most gifted among us must learn
to know himself, as it is only through this knowledge
that he can know others, and therefore know how to affect
others.
Delsarte's philosophy of physical expression enables the
student to analyze and classify his own motions and their
corresponding emotions. It places expression on a sure
and certain footing; it makes the actor independent of his
moods and delivers him from the thraldom of an untoward
temperament. It enables him at will to put on the sem-
blance of a feeling which he does not at the moment
experience; for has he not already analyzed it, and is he
not familiar with its source and stop? The real feeling
cannot always be commanded at the moment when it is
required, hence the necessity for a perfect simulation to
preserve the illusion. Delsarte's methods are Nature's
methods systematized for the purposes of art. When the
formulæ of the Delsartian principles first reached this

country, they were seized upon by all manner of charla-
tans whose heralding of the “New System of Acting”
and “Acting Made Easy” brought the subject into a dis-
repute from which it is but just emerging. From the
announcements of these quacks one was given to under-
stand that what Delsarte had discovered was a purchasable
commodity, and that a term of twenty lessons with its
dispensers would equip one with a supply of ready-made
tragedy and compressed pathos which could be taken
home, and, as it were, turned on at will. And the spirit
of guileless, aspiring youth rose to an exuberant state.
The result was a storm of “Juliets,” “Ophelias,” and
“Melnottes” whose measured artificial woes carried un-
measured real distress to many innocent on-lookers.
These absurdities — which are scarcely exaggerated —
become transparent when it is remembered that Delsarte's
reasoning is in perfect accord with the best monuments
of tradition, and with the results of the most enlightened
research. It fully recognizes the fact that the artistic,
like the poetic, temperament is essentially a matter of in-
heritance, not of study; that its promptings are intuitive,
not volitional; and that while cultivation can do much to
hasten development and expansion, it cannot supply the
material to be developed and expanded. It may broaden
and enlighten; it was never intended to originate or create.

This is all quite in keeping with Delsarte's teachings,
which, while they recognize no school, prove their univer-
sality by comprehending all schools.
All great artists have been Delsartians, – unwittingly in
most instances, but nevertheless in full sympathy with the
opinions he disseminated. Most actors of note who work
systematically pursue, sometimes without knowing it, his
explicit directions for cultivating and economizing physical
resources. An eminent tragedienne now residing in this
country, in a conversation with the writer, disclaimed any
knowledge of Delsarte, and in the next breath uncon-
sciously avowed herself his stanch supporter by naming
among the features of her daily practice physical exercises
which are fundamental in Delsarte's system of mechanics;
the reason for this is perhaps explainable in the tendency
of broad and comprehensive minds to travel in similar
channels, thus reaching the same destination, though going
by different routes.
Other things being equal, the actor with a system has
an infinite advantage over him who is without any. In
preparing a character for representation on the stage, the
former is able to keep constantly narrowing the plane over
which his efforts are dispersed ; from the universal and
general going to the specific and particular, and by thus
concentrating his thought, he effects an immense saving of

time and labor. He applies a few simple tests and ascer-
tains to which class his character belongs ; knowing this,
he is able to tell which of the three phases of the being
is apt to predominate or rule, and the order of subordina-
tion of the other two. This enables him to disengage the
salient traits and features of the character, and being
already in possession of their corresponding outward equiv-
alents, he gives prominence to them, sinking the others
by contrast; thus his work is greatly simplified.
His methodless brother, on the other hand, is like the
much-quoted rudderless ship; he is plunged at once into
an infinite sea of doubt, where he is left experimenting
and speculating, squandering his time and energies until
some temporary harbor of thought is sighted in which he
takes refuge. That student fails, however, to grasp the
significance of Delsarte's labors in behalf of æsthetic science
who imagines that a knowledge of the mere mechanics or
the mere theory will suffice to give him command over his
own resources in the interpretation of human character in
art work.
No, this is not enough ; it is the thoughtful merging
of the two. It is the idea, feeling, or emotion speaking
through cultivated mediums that touches the subtlest
chords of harmony. When it is remembered how much
meaning can be conveyed by a timely and responsive

look, or a significant movement of the head or arm, what
a language the perfected whole must speak! Our work will
always bear the stamp of ourselves upon it; and just so
much of head and heart as we put into that work, just
so much will be reflected in the result. The creation
can never be above the creator.
